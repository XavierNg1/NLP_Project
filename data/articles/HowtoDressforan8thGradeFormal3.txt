 Renting your formal attire is a great cost-effective option when preparing for your formal.


Make sure to try on all the parts of your outfit in advance, so you know they fit. Set up your rental plenty of time in advance.
You can even rent dress shoes, if you don’t have any.
 When planning for formal, don’t feel like you have to wear a suit or a tux if you don’t want to. A button down shirt and slacks is a great alternative.


You can even get a little bit casual and pair black jeans with a button down and bow tie or suspenders.
Alternatively, make a classic suit more interesting by wearing nice sneakers like Converse.
 Though you should stick to standard neutrals for your main suit, you do want the accents to match your partner’s dress or outfit.


For example, if your date has a green dress, you might want to wear a green bow tie.
If you can get a picture of your date’s outfit before you got to pick out yours. That way, you can better match colors.
 You want to make sure that you look your best at the eighth grade formal. Shave off any stubble you have, and use a little hair gel to comb through your hair.


Wash your face, and pluck any stray eyebrow hairs.
Give yourself a few sprays of cologne, if you have it.

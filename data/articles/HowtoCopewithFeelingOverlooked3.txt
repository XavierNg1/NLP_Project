 Being overlooked or not receiving the recognition you deserve can sometimes be a sign that you are dependable and typically do a good job. People may naturally expect great things from you. Therefore, you aren't always recognized for doing good.The next time you are overlooked for praise, tell yourself, “This isn’t about me not being good enough. It’s about other people’s insecurities about me.”
Don’t compromise your integrity by not being as good as you are just so you’ll receive recognition. Stay true to yourself by being yourself.
Keep in mind that not being singled out can be a positive thing. Not all attention is good attention.
 People who are overlooked often care for everyone else but themselves. You can stop this by recognizing and caring for your feelings. You should also make yourself a priority: regard yourself with the same value as everyone else, if not more.

By doing this you can stop yourself from being a doormat. People will learn to stop overlooking and taking advantage of you when you consider yourself just as important as them.Value yourself by learning to say "no" to excessive demands and asking for help when you need it.
 Write down when you do something well, particularly at work. Having concrete evidence of how well you’re performing can help when it’s time for a promotion and you believe you’re going to be overlooked. You can show this to your boss when it’s time for your review or when you have a meeting about your performance.

Ask your boss to meet with you regularly to discuss how you’re doing. Asking often shows that you are interested in doing well, which displays initiative and can put you at the forefront of your boss’ mind the next time an opportunity occurs.Be sure to praise yourself as well. Take a look at everything you have achieved and give yourself the praise you deserve even if no one else does. This can help to improve your motivation and self-esteem.

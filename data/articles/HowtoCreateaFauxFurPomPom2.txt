 To make a large pom pom, cut out two circles in the same size. You can make the circles any size that you like. Using two 4 inch (10.2 cm) circles will result in a pom pom that is about the size of a fist. If you want your pom pom to be larger, then cut larger circles.Use a plate, container lid, or some other kind of circular object as a guide when you are cutting out the circles.
 The right sides are the sides of the fabric with print on them, or in this case, with fur on them. Line up the two circles with the fur sides facing each other.You may even want to pin the circles together to keep them lined up while you sew the edges together.
 Use a sewing machine to sew a straight stitch along the edges of the circles, but leave about a 2 inch (5.1 cm) gap to flip the pom poms inside out and to insert your stuffing. Using a sewing machine will create a tight stitch to keep the stuffing inside of your fur pom poms. However, you can also hand sew the edges of the circles together if you do not have a sewing machine.Remove the pins as you sew.
 After sewing the edges together, use the gap that you left to turn the fabric inside out. This will put the fur side of your faux fur fabric to the outside.If the gap is too small to pull the fabric through, use a seam ripper or scissors to cut a few of the stitches and widen the gap.
 When the fur is on the outside again, fill the pom pom with nylon stuffing, cotton balls, or scrap fabric.You do not need to overstuff the pom pom. Use just enough stuffing to give the pom pom its round shape., When you are happy with the stuffing level of your pom pom, sew the gap closed to finish it. Use a needle and thread to hand sew the gap closed. As you sew the gap closed, try to tuck under the edges of the fabric so that no raw edges will be visible.After the gap is all stitched up, your pom pom is ready to use!

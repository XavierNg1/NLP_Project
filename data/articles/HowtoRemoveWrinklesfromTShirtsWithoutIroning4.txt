 Hang it on a hanger or spread it on flat surface under the fan or breeze. Hang the t-shirt in open area to dry it automatically with cool breeze.
 When the shirt has dried, you will see it is free of wrinkles. IF you flatten the shirt on a flat surface and move your hands on it, you will be able to remove any remaining wrinkles. Wear or fold away for later use.

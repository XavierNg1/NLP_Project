 Chop off the bottom 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of the leek and dark green leaves at the top. The remaining stalk should be white and light green.









You may also need to remove any tough outer leaves. These leaves will be difficult to slice into narrow strips and may have an unpleasant texture if consumed.
The dark green leaves are bitter and tough, which is why they are not typically eaten.
 Slice the leek into two equal halves, cutting from the bottom of the stalk to the top.
 Slice across the width of the stalk as many times as necessary to separate the entire stalk into smaller portions.
 The rounded side of each 2-inch (5-cm) section should face the cutting board and the flat side should face up.
 Make narrow lengthwise slices across each portion. The cuts should be similar in thickness to the width of each inner layer.









Use one hand to hold each section of leek in place as you cut. Place your hand across the width of the section and cut along the length, starting on the side opposite you. Gradually work your way across the width of the leek until you reach the side nearest you.
Use enough pressure as you hold the leek in place so that the layers begin to fan out and separate slightly.
Due to the thinness of these slices and the manner in which they are cut, you should not need to separate them after cutting the leek.

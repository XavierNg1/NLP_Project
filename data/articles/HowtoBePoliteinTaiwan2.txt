Expensive alcohol and tea are safe gifts, especially at a dinner event. If you decide to get your hosts another item, make sure that you have multiple.
 Always follow through on your plans. If you cancel or forget plans, most Taiwanese people will be very offended. It is typical in American culture to cancel on plans, but it is considered very rude in most Asian countries.Avoid casually mentioning that you should get together or have lunch. If you intend to follow up, pick a date and time to assure that you follow through.
 It is considered polite to show interest in other peoplesâ€™ personal lives. Questions that may seem overly personal in Western culture can be considered normal in Taiwan.


If you are unsure of what to ask, it is okay to repeat questions that you were asked.
If you are asked an overly personal question, do not become uncomfortable.

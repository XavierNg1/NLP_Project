 There are many free blogger platforms that will host the blog for you in return for showing ads on your blog. They include Blogger, Wordpress, Vox, and several others.


As an alternative you can obtain blogging software and host the blog on your own domain. This requires more time, money and technical expertise though.;
, i.e dogs, your hobbies, personal philosophy, political view, etc. It can be anything. If you want to attract regular readers, it is best to stick to one subject and become the world's most frequent blogger on it.
 Try to update it on a regular basis.

 Place a medium-sized pot on the stove and pour an inch of water in the bottom. Turn the heat on to medium-high so the water begins to simmer.Ensure that your metal steamer basket will fit in the pot. The pot should also have a tight-fitting lid.;
, Wash the kale under cold water to remove any dirt or grit. Remove the tough stem from each leaf of kale. You can either tear it out or carefully use a sharp knife to slice the stem away. Tear or chop the kale into bite-sized pieces.Discard the stems or save them for another recipe.
You can dry the kale if it makes it easier for you to tear or chop.
 Once the water in your saucepan is simmering (bubbling a little), put the kale in the steamer basket. Set the steamer basket into your saucepan and cover the pot with the tight-fitting lid. Let the kale steam over medium-high heat for 5 to 10 minutes. Stir it occasionally so it steams evenly.You can taste the kale and season it with a vinegar or squeeze of lemon juice.
For easy removal, just use tongs to scoop the kale out of the steamer basket. This will also help any water drip off of the kale.
 Place the steamed kale in a serving bowl. Drizzle a vinaigrette or dressing over the kale and gently stir it to combine. You can serve the steamed kale while it's still warm or let it cool to room temperature before serving. Good choices for dressings include:


Bleu cheese dressing
Caesar

Hummus

 They are fairly cheap.;
,, Make sure you have enough on the edges of the notebook to fold in to cover the edge. You want to cut the paper in half because you are going to glue the paper on the front and back covers, getting to the binding as close as possible. Then fold the three sides inward with enough to glue down securely.
 Here you can cut it to meet the other paper perfectly or you can tear it to give it an edginess. If you do this, you will want to overlap the paper. Then you may want to ink it by running the ink pad along the torn page. You don't have to use ink if you don't want.
 Use your corner punch for the two corners that are placed on the outside edge.
, If you want to add ribbon or decorative string, you want to add it to the outside, leaving enough on both ends so you can place it under the paper from step #6 before gluing it down on the inside of the book.
, Date the top of the page showing when you wrote in the journal, even if the photo is from 10 years ago. But then write the date of the photo underneath it. Sometimes you can write and not add a photo but other times if you do add a photo, you want to tell the story of what was going on the day the photo was taken. You don't have to throw out the photo where it might've been ruined because you blinked or turned your head or you weren't in any of the photos that might've made it into a scrapbook. So you can take a copy or a bad photo and put it in your journal and write about it.

 Is a fresh egg denser than an old egg, or is it the other way around? Line up several glasses of water with different amounts of salt stirred in, from plain water to heavy salt water. Drop a fresh, raw egg into a glass, then move it left or right until you find the least salty water the egg can float in. Repeat this each day, using a new egg from the same carton. As the eggs get older, do they float in more glasses, or sink? Read about what happened once you've tested it.


If you can, get your eggs directly from a farmer. Supermarket eggs are often a couple weeks old when you buy them, so it will be harder to notice the difference., Do you think boiling an egg would change its density? Set up the same experiment – a row of water with different amounts of salt – but this time, compare fresh eggs with boiled eggs. Is there a difference? Read about the results.
 Can you think of a way to make a glass of salt water with the same density as the egg? Here's one approach:Stir ⅓ cup (80 mL) salt into 1⅔ cups (400 mL) water until it all dissolves. This is a "stock solution" you will use to make other salt water mixes.
Fill glass number 1 with ¾ cup (180 mL) of the stock solution.
Fill glasses 2 through 5 with ¾ cup plain water each.
Mix ¾ cup stock solution into glass number 2. This is now half as salty as glass 1.
Take ¾ cup from glass 2 and mix it into glass 3. Glass 3 is now half as salty as glass 2.
Mix in ¾ cup from glass 3 into glass 4. Leave glass 5 as plain water.
Try to float an egg in each glass. If you got close to the density of the egg, it will float in the middle of the glass, stand on the base, or bob just below the surface.

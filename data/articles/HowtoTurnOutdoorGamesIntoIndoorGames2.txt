 Consider the number of kids playing indoors and try to accommodate enough space for them to move around and have fun. Move furniture around and try to find a larger room in your house.


A living room or basement are two ideal locations indoor play.
Electronic equipment should be moved.
 Sharp corners, edges, utensils, or tools should be eliminated from the rooms involving indoor play. Remove objects that can break or shatter from shelves, and be careful to choose a room that doesn't have windows or mirrors that could break.Lit candles or open flames should be put out before the kids start playing.
 If your children are going to be playing on hardwood floors, it may be a good idea to lay down mats in case they fall. You can purchase playmats made specifically for younger children, or purchase wrestling mats online and at larger department stores. Mats can prevent injuries and broken bones if the indoor game gets too physical., Set up any basketball hoops or inflate any balls that the kids need to play. Some equipment may be complicated, and require you to construct it before it's useable. Set the equipment in a clean and safe environment.

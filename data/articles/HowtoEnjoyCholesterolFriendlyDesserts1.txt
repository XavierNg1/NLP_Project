 To remove cholesterol from dessert recipes while baking, substitute for the eggs with a cholesterol-free alternative. A whole, regular egg has 210 milligrams of cholesterol, while egg whites and egg substitutes (e.g. Egg Beaters) contain none. Eggs generally serve as the binding agent in recipes and must be replaced in specific ratios.One large egg should be replaced by two large egg whites or 1/4 cup of egg substitute.;
, Fruit purees can be a sweet, light substitute for fats in recipes, such as butter and shortening. Fats usually add moisture to baked desserts, which results in a lighter, finer texture. Apple sauce and pureed, canned pears are good alternatives that do not significantly alter the taste or appearance of your baked goods.Replace fats cup-for-cup with fruit purees.
 Mashed banana can be used to replace eggs in recipes (1/2 cup for 1 egg) to lower cholesterol. Bananas also add sweetness, bind the mixture, and provide potassium and magnesium. Note that bananas will lend their distinct flavour to the recipe, so make sure this addition will work in your dessert., Soy protein is a good alternative for many foods that are high in animal fats. Whenever possible, use soy as a substitute for its cholesterol-heavy counterparts in dessert recipes. For instance:Substitute soy nut butter for butter
Use soy milk instead of regular milk
Use soy cheese in place of regular cheese (e.g. in a cheesecake)

, Low-cholesterol recipes are often likely to bake faster than regular recipes because of the lower fat content. Try lowering the recommended temperature of the oven by 25 degrees, and start checking your dessert 5-10 minutes before it should be done baking. Check your baked goods for lightly browned edges or a springy texture to make sure they are done.

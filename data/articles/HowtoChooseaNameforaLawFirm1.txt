 If you have a law firm with a family member, you might consider doubling the name to give a name to your law firm.


For example, Morgan and Morgan would make a good name for a law firm with parents and children or two siblings, or even husband and wife practicing together.;
, If you are staring your law firm with a few partners, use everyone’s last name to acknowledge all the partners.


Blandino, Smith, White and Edwards would work for a firm founded by 4 partners.
 If you have some partners with plain names like Smith or Jones, these names might not stand out to your clients. Names like Sugarman and Hoopendahl are more memorable. These might be a better choice for the first name in a series of partner names.
 Often, if you are using partner names for the firm, each attorney would like their name to be listed first. Obviously, only one name can go first, so the partners will have to agree on whose name is first.


Remember that if you have more than two names in your firm’s name, people will be most likely to use the first two names to describe your firm.
Because the first two names will be the most often used, these names need to be the most memorable, distinctive and easy to remember.
 If you are using names, try to limit the number of names you include. This will help people remember you.


Shorter or fewer names will be easier to include on signs, business cards and email addresses.
 A name such as Oleskewicz might not be the best choice for a law firm name. Your clients might not be able to pronounce this name easily.
 If you use a few partner names or a combination of words, be sure to check what the initials spell. You might not like the abbreviation for something like Peterson, Edwards and Edgemont.
 You may have to carefully negotiate with your law partners about which name to use for your firm. Make sure that you include your partners in the name choosing process and come to a decision about a name that everyone is reasonably happy with.

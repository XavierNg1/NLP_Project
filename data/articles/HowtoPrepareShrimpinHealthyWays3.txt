Peel a shrimp by hand by removing its legs and then peeling off the shell. You should be able to see the thin blue vein running through the shrimp. Make a shallow cut near the top of the shrimp, grab onto the vein, and gently pull it out.Eating the vein is not harmful, and you can skip de-veining in a rush. However, many people dislike the taste and texture of the vein.

 On the whole, snakes prefer to strike or to slither right away to a safe hiding spot.And generally, snakes do not chase you. Hence, giving them wide berth makes good sense at all times upon discovering a snake, to avoid strike, and to give them the chance to slither off.


Striking distance for most snakes is half the body length of the snake.
Strikes are for protection, not for eating. As such, the bites will be shallow. This means that if you're properly attired, the fangs should sink into a boot, not your foot. However, if you've upset the snake by poking, prodding, or generally getting in its way, it may react by biting more than once, or more deeply.;
, Unless you're one hundred percent sure that the snake is not venomous, getting closer is not advised.
 This is especially important if the snake is hissing, rattling, or staring at you. Be patient and wait for it to back off. A snake has a short attention span and will be more concerned for its safety than worrying about you. Remain still even if the snake slithers over your feel or coils around you; it won't remain for long.
 If you know for sure that the snake is venomous, retreat the moment that you can. Call for professional help immediately and prevent children, pets, and anybody else from going into that area of your garden or yard until the snake has been removed.


If you cannot identify the snake, err on the side of caution and retreat. Call the professional snake remover and keep the kids and pets out of the garden.
 The benefit of a non-venomous snake in the garden is a free pest-catcher. If you'd rather not share your yard with the snake, however, grab a broomstick and shoo it away. Don't touch the snake or harm it in any wayâ€“remember that even venomous snakes would prefer the opportunity to slither off than deal with as large a problem as a human.

 Because it contains acetic acid, vinegar also works to remove some stains. Start by mixing one part distilled white vinegar to one part water in a bowl large enough to fit your dentures.
 Allowing at least eight hours to pass will give the acetic acid time to dissolve all tartar.


If you don’t have eight hours, you can try a shorter soak. Even half an hour will dissolve some tartar.
 Remove your dentures from the solution and, using a soft-bristled toothbrush, brush them as you usually would. Don’t scrub them with anything too abrasive.
 After brushing, rinse your dentures with plain tap water.
 Use a towel or other cloth to gently dry your dentures.
 Some people soak their dentures in vinegar and water as frequently as every night.

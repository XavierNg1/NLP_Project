 One of the easiest ways to prevent stretched sweaters is to avoid hanging them up. If you store your sweaters by hanging them in a closet, the weight of the sweater will pull it down over time. This is especially true for thick, bulky, or beaded sweaters that are heavy.


Hanging sweaters on the hanger also causes peaks in the shoulder area where the hanger stretches the fabric.
 Instead of hanging the sweaters, fold or roll them and store them in a dresser. To fold a sweater, lay it on a flat surface so the front faces down. Fold each of the arms across the back of the sweater so they cross. Gather one end of the sweater and fold it over so the sleeves are contained.You can also roll your sweaters to prevent stretching. Once you've laid the sweater and folded the arms in, gather the bottom end of the sweater and roll it up to the collar.
 If you don't have storage space to keep folded sweaters and you have to hang the sweaters, use proper support. Choose hangers that are thick and have lots of padding. The size of the hanger should match the size of the shoulders so the sweater doesn't slide off or stretch to fit the hanger.Consider folding the sweater and hanging it across the lower bar of the hanger.
Never hang your sweaters on metal clothes hangers. These easily stretch the shoulders.
 Try not to hang your sweaters for an extended period of time, especially if you won't be wearing and caring for them. To store them for the long term, wash and dry them properly. Fold the sweaters and put them in storage clothing bags or boxes that offer good air circulation. Look for storage containers made of cotton, muslin or canvas.Avoid using vacuum-sealed bags for storing clothes. Any moisture that's sealed into the bags with the clothes can cause mildew and staining.

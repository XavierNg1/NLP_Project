 If possible, wear clothing that will disguise the tattoo--long-sleeved shirts, jackets, pants, etc.


If you’re not ready to go the more permanent (and costly) route of getting a cover-up tattoo or getting laser-removal done, using clothing to cover the tattoo is a relatively easy temporary measure.
Flesh-colored tattoo-covering sleeves are available from online retailers, including sizes to cover the whole arm, lower or upper arm, wrist, and ankle.;
, Find a heavy-coverage foundation that matches the tone of your skin near the tattoo.


Certain makeup products are even designed specifically for covering tattoos and can be found online or at many beauty supply stores.
Though also not ideal for the long-term, covering your tattoo with makeup can help you deal with it in the short-term.
 Cover-ups typically involve covering the old tattoo with a new, larger one.


Find a tattoo artist or shop that specializes in cover-ups and can show you a portfolio of quality work. If it wasn’t done right the last time, you want to make sure it will be this time.
You’ll need a design that’s larger than the original tattoo--and sometimes significantly so.
Work with your artist to create a design that will work with the features of the old one. Because it’s often hard to completely cover over a new tattoo, you’ll want a design that can integrate and then camouflage the old one.
Most cover-up tattoos will be done in color in order to better cover the old one. Tribal-style tattoos tend to be the exception.

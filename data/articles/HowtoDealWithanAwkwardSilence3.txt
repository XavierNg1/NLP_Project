 Most people love talking about themselves. If you indulge them, the conversation will most likely continue without missing a beat. Avoid questions that are too personal or uncomfortable, but express genuine curiosity in the person you are talking to.Asking things like “What is your all time favorite band,” will get a conversation started and open up the floor for follow up questions like “Have you ever seen them in concert?”

, Sharing your passions with another person will, in most cases, keep a conversation going for a long time. Be secure enough to show your enthusiasm for the things that interest you. Just try not to dominate the conversation and be sure that you allow the other person time to express their interests, too.Say you absolutely love “The Wizard of Oz,” instead of simply telling the other person “My favorite movie is ‘The Wizard of Oz,’” you could talk a little about why you love it so much, how the movie is different from the book (like the fact that the book featured silver slippers instead of ruby slippers), etc.
 Rarely, if ever, is there a perfect thing to say. Relax into the conversation and be yourself. If awkward silence is often an issue in your conversations it could be because you are thinking too much about what you should say, instead of communicating what you really want to say.

 If you have tried airing out and cleaning your new car, you should have been successful in eliminating most of the odor. If you have a small amount of odor left, you can easily mask it by hanging an air freshener from your rearview mirror or spraying around a deodorizing spray. Use your favorite scent and make sure the freshener is near the driverâ€™s side of the car so that you can smell it., If you want to do more than just mask the smell, consider buying an industrial strength odor eliminator. These can be found at automotive stores and are formulated specifically for neutralizing bad car odors., There are certain smells that are extremely potent and have a reputation for lingering. The smell of fast food or popcorn for instance can often linger long after the food is eaten. Perfumes and colognes are also formulated to have a lasting scent. Introduce a new scent into your car that you know will be able to last and mask the new car smell until it is gone.Only do this if you like the smell that you are introducing, or else you could have an even bigger problem on your hands!

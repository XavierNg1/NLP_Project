 Girls in the 7th grade tend to shop at places such as Aeropostale, Target, Delia's, Abercrombie and Fitch, Tilly's, Forever 21, Hollister, and places like that. They will most likely sell cute and trendy clothes, that you might like as well! Remember to buy whatever you want, don't let others pressure you into buying something you don't particularly like.;
, Ask your parents first. If they say no, try going very light, like tinted lip balm. If you are allowed to put makeup on, you can use things like eyeshadow, mascara, or hair spray. Remember to respect school rules regarding makeup.
 In your purse you should have Chapstick or lip balm, money if you need it, and keys if you walk home. Don't forget to carry sanitary wear items if you've started your period.
 No one wants to stand next to a girl who smells bad, so take a shower every day or every other day. Also, don't wear heavy-smelling perfume or mist, stick to subtle scents like vanilla and jasmine. Also, remember to wear deodorant/anti-perspirant.
 Buy fashion magazines such as Teen Vogue, Seventeen, and Glamour. They have the newest, most up-to-date fashion trends. You don't have to follow them, but they're certainly a good place to start if you're searching for a new look.
 People will say mean things but you shouldn't let them bother you. If you like yourself how you are, no one has any say in the matter.

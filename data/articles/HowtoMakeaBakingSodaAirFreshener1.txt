 Add 1 tablespoon (14 g) of baking soda to a small bowl or dish. Mix 5 to 6 drops of an essential oil into the baking soda with a spoon until they are well combined.You don’t necessarily have to add an essential oil to the air freshener. The baking soda will absorb odors to help freshen the air on its own. However, adding the essential oil will allow the freshener to give off a pleasant scent too.
Use your favorite essential oil to scent the air freshener. If you want to get creative, you can even mix two or more oils to create a custom scent. Lavender, chamomile, peppermint, lemon, eucalyptus, and rosemary essential oils are all good options.;
, When the baking soda and oil are well mixed, transfer the mixture to an clean, empty spray bottle. Don’t try to pour it directly from the bowl, though, or you may make a mess. Use a spoon to carefully add the powder to the bottle.If you have small funnel, you may want to use it to pour the baking soda mixture into the bottle. It will keep the mixture from flying everywhere as you pour.
 Once you’ve transferred the baking soda mixture to the spray bottle, add enough water to fill the bottle. Shake the bottle well to fully combine the water and baking soda mixture.Be sure to use distilled water for the air freshener.
 After you’ve shaken the bottle to fully mix all of the ingredients, you’re ready to use the air freshener. Spray it throughout an entire room to freshen the air, or target specific items, such as your sofa or a pair of sneakers.

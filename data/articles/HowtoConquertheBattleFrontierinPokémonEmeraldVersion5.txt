 The Battle Pike is a large pike designed in the image of a Seviper. Inside it are 21 rooms, grouped into sets of three. Going through 14 rooms in a row clears a set. Using 3 of your Pokémon, you must choose one of the rooms in a set in order to proceed. Based on your choice, you may encounter Trainer battles, wild Pokémon, having your Pokémon healed by the maids on duty, or a Trainer whose Pokémon will inflict a status problem to your Pokémon. The Battle Pike tests your luck in making decisions., Before you select a room, there is a maid standing near the rooms. If talked to, she gives a hint as to what to expect in one of the rooms. By heeding her advice, you can save yourself from unnecessary battles or have your Pokémon healed frequently., The main nuisance of the Battle Pike is to be afflicted by status ailments such as poison and paralysis, so it is recommended that you either carry useful berries (such as Pecha or Cheri Berries), or carry Pokémon that are immune to certain status ailments. For example, carrying a Steel-type Pokémon will avoid poisoning, as Poison-type moves do not affect Steel-type Pokémon., The Frontier Brain of the Battle Pike is Lucy, also known as the Pike Queen. She is encountered after you go through 27 and 139 rooms in a streak. This means that Lucy will be in the final room of the 2nd consecutive pass through the Battle Pike for the Silver challenge, and in the final room of the 10th consecutive pass for the Gold challenge. Upon her defeat, she will award the Luck Symbol.

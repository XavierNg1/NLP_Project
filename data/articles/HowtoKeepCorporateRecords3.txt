 Any decision made by the board regarding the organization or operation of the company should be included. Once you become incorporated, your company can act only through its board of directors. You will often have to provide evidence of board approval of certain actions such as opening a new line of credit or selling stock to investors.
Corporate minutes become an important part of the due diligence necessary when another company is interested in taking you over or you acquire additional major investors.
If a decision requires shareholder approval, that approval should be noted in your corporate minutes.
You should generally plan on keeping the minutes of board meetings and board decisions for at least three years from the date of the meeting or decision.
 You should be able to look at the entry and quickly determine the action that was taken, who took it, and when. Designate a secretary at each board meeting. He or she will be responsible for taking written notes of all decisions made and formal resolutions adopted at the meeting.
Get in the habit of creating minutes immediately after any board meeting rather than creating minutes for several meetings at once months after the fact. This ensures that entries are accurate and important details aren't left out.
 This allows each entry to be easily organized and read. Search online for basic templates that can be used for your corporate minutes.
You may also consider buying or subscribing to a software service to manage and format your minutes.
Include a file-stamped copy of the business's certificate of incorporation and bylaws in the front of your corporate minute book for easy reference, as well as your list of officers and directors.

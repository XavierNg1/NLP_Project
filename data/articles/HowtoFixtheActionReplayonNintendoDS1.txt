 Insert your action replay as you normally would into your Nintendo DS. After you receive the "Warning - Health and Safety" warning message, if your Action Replay does not load, your DS is not detecting your action replay. In this case, you should see the following options:

There is no DS card inserted
There is no Game Pack inserted;
, It is recommended that you turn off your DS before inserting or removing DS Game Cards or Gameboy Advance Game Paks.After your DS has powered off, remove your Action Replay from the device., Common household cleaners can damage the connectors that link your Action Replay to your DS, so it's best to avoid these. Instead, take a Q-tip or cotton-ball, apply a little bit of Isopropyl Alcohol (70-90% strength, also called rubbing alcohol), and wipe the metal connectors on your Action Replay.The connectors that link your Action Replay to your DS are on the bottom back of your Replay. They are shaped like a series of flat, metallic teeth, much like the teeth of a comb.
You can also use electronics cleaner, which is available at most electronics stores or larger retailers that have technology departments, like Target or Walmart.
Do not use too much of your cleaner. This can do damage to the internal parts of your Action Replay or your DS. Instead, dampen your cotton-ball or Q-tip with your cleaner, wipe the connectors, and then dry with a clean, soft cloth.
 Now that you've cleaned the connectors on your action replay, there should be better connectivity between it and your DS and, hopefully, it will start normally.

If this does not solve your problem, your Action Replay might be broken or your situation might require a different fix.

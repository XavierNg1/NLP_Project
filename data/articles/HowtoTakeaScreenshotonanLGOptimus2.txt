 You may need to turn your phone on or bring it out of standby mode. Once you've arrived at your home screen, you can open Quick Memo through you Notification Menu. Access your Notification Menu by swiping your finger from the top of your screen downwards, and from the options available, choose "Quick Memo."


If you have difficulty accessing your Notification Menu or cannot find "Quick Menu" listed in its options, you can press the up and down buttons for your volume control (located on the left side of your phone) to open Quick Memo.
 Quick Memo is intended to allow you a quick way to jot memos on your screen, take screenshots, or do both.If you only want to take a screenshot, immediately touch the save button, which will be shaped like a floppy disk.


You can also use the Quick Memo's pen tool (represented by a pen icon), to jot notes about the images on your screen. These will also show up in your screenshot after you have saved the image.
 You can find your gallery by tapping the App icon, represented by three stacked horizontal lines. In the subsequent list of apps, you should find "Gallery." Tap this, and you should see a list of albums, among which should be the "QuickMemo" subfolder. In this folder you should find your screenshot.
 You can make adjustments to your image by tapping it while in the QuickMemo subfolder, clicking the menu icon (represented by three stacked horizontal lines), and selecting "Crop." Now you can touch the small manipulator boxes, located in the middle of each side of a larger box that represents the part of the image you will keep, and crop out parts of your screenshot you don't want included in the picture.

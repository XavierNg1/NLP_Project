 This folder is usually going to be located under My Documents\EA Games\The Sims 2 in your computer. If you have found that location & there is no folder named "Downloads", you can go ahead and create one.
 A blue window will pop up asking you to install the content. Click OK or Accept or Yes or whichever option the installer has.

 Arboreal snakes will need much higher enclosures than terrestrial. The enclosure or tub should be large enough to let the snake stretch and move around and incorporate a water dish and hide and any other decor and the snake comfortably.;
, Basking bulbs can make the environment too dry for some more tropical species so Under Tank Heating (UTH) by way of commercial reptile heat pad or heat tape is a popular method. Ceramic heat emitters may also be used with some species.
 Commercially made PVC hides can be purchased as well as cork bark, drift wood, live and fake plants, rocks and more depending on your imagination.
 It must be big enough for the snake to soak in but for snakes that soak more, or if using racks with smaller tubs, smaller bowls can be used. Ensure that the bowl is sturdy so that the snake cannot spill the water or tip the bowl over.
 Popular choices are: newspaper, paper towel, cypress mulch or other commercial reptile mulches, sand, coco husk, coco fiber, aspen.


Do not use pine or cedar shavings, as these can be toxic to reptiles.
 If using racks ensure there are no gaps the snakes can squeeze through between the shelves.
 These are each required for accurate temperature, humidity monitoring and control.

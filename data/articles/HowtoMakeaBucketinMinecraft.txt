 Mine with a stone, iron or diamond pickaxe.;
, You'll need 3 ingots.
, They must be arranged in a "V" shape, so try either:


2 iron ingots in the center side squares and one in the center base square; or
2 iron ingots in the top side squares and one in the center square.
 Shift click or drag the bucket to your inventory.
 Right click with the bucket in your hand to fill. Water is the one liquid you can place down without causing harm.
 Rarely, you may find a lava pool spawning above the surface. Right click with the bucket in your hand to fill. Take care not to fall in while retrieving. Also take care not to place the bucket of lava in such a way as to accidentally burn down your house (and kill off your character).
 It is the one liquid that is not placeable in the unmodified version of the game. You can use it to make a cake or drink it to rid yourself of either negative or positive potion effects (depends on the potion).

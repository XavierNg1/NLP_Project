 Place the frozen peaches, peach schnapps, vodka, champagne, peach nectar, and ice in a blender. Cover the blender with its lid.


To prevent splashes, place the peaches and ice in first, followed by the liquid ingredients.
Do not add the dark raspberry liquor yet.
For this recipe, a smaller amount of peach schnapps, vodka, and champagne is recommended since you will also be adding raspberry liquor. If you prefer strong drinks, however, you can adjust the amounts to your own taste.
Use a full 1 cup (250 ml) of ice. If you use less, the drink may become too thin, and the final addition of liquor may sink as a result.
 Switch the blender on for about 30 seconds, or until the mixture becomes smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed.


Use a "blend burst" feature, when available, to help break apart large chunks of ice.
If you need to push any of the ice further down toward the blades, make sure that the blender is off before you do so.
 Pour the drink into one or two serving glasses.


Do not fill the glasses to the top. Leave 2 inches (5 cm) or so of empty space. That's where the liquor will go.
 If done right, the liquor should sit on top instead of sinking into the rest of the drink.


This is where the "down under" style comes in. The Wallaby Darned is "Down Under" the raspberry liquor.
 Place a straw in each serving glass and enjoy the drink right away.


If you let the drink sit out too long, it could melt and become watery.

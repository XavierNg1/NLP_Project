 Put on a warm sweater, and some warm pants or sweatpants. Don't go overboard with your clothes,. There is no need to wear a parka and snow pants when you are lounging around on the sofa working on writing your wikiHows.;
, Put on socks or slippers. Mix and match your pairs, and go crazy.
 Take out your favorite blanket or pillows. Bring them from your bedroom, take one off the back of the sofa. Cuddle up.
 Make a cup of your favorite warm drink, such as coffee, hot cocoa, or tea. Fancy it up with marshmallows if you have them.
 Find a pet that you can cuddle with, for example a dog, cat, or bunny. If it's really cold, get three dogs.
 Find something on TV that you really want to watch.
 Now relax, and enjoy your day.

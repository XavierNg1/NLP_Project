 Ionomer covers are plastic covers. When you hit them with a golf club, they tend to absorb the energy from the golf club and not spin. This can prevent your ball from spinning and thus gives it more control through the air., You want your golf balls to have more spin when youâ€™re near greens. Spin on a ball is great for controlling short golf shots, and can often lead the ball to stick to the green instead of rolling away.These are also best for golfers who often drive their ball less than 240 yards.
 A multilayer ball also restricts the spin of the ball. These are best for drives that need to go exactly in the direction you want.

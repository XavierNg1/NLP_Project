 The easiest way to wear out an active dog is to go on a long walk. Depending on its size, take it out for an hour or more once a day or as often as possible.Be sure to monitor your dog’s endurance level and avoid wearing it out, especially if it’s smaller. Try to identify how long it can go before panting hard and appearing overexerted. Do your best to factor in the walk back home.
Try varying where you walk it so it’s exposed to more sights and smells. This will give it mental stimulation in addition to physical exercise.
 Whether your dog has a high chase drive or prey drive, playing fetch, catch, hide and seek, and other active games will help keep it busy. Games like these will engage its drives, keep it physically active, and give it mental stimulation.Keep in mind that a dog that doesn’t get enough exercise or is bored is more likely to engage in destructive behavior, like chewing your possessions or going after other animals.
 It’s wise to make sure everyone in your household is comfortable handling your dog, especially if you have children. Find a local training class and have everyone attend together to learn how to control your dog when it chases or tries to break away.Call your local breed club or breed rescue group and ask them to recommend a trainer who’s good with your dog’s breed. You can also try asking your dog’s vet for a referral, or check with local kennels, community groups (like 4-H or Scout troops), or major pet stores in your area.
 If it’s affordable and if one is locally available, try enrolling your dog in an agility or sport class. Some trainers that specialize in specific breeds or groups have equipment and obstacle courses specially designed for dogs that chase, stalk, and track. These specialized activities are effective ways of releasing your dog’s pent-up energy and instinctive drives.Again, you can find out information about locally available options from a nearby breed club or by asking your vet.

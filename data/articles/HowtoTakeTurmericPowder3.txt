 Turmeric contains a powerful element called curcumin. Curcumin has been shown to ease indigestion because of its effect on the gallbladder. By prompting the gallbladder to produce more bile, curcumin can improve digestion and soothe the symptoms of bloating., Curcumin is also an effective anti-inflammatory. As such, it can help ease a wide range of medical conditions, from arthritis and psoriasis to chronic back or neck pain.


Curcumin prevents the activation of the COX 2 gene, which produces an enzyme that can lead to painful inflammation., Turmeric has strong antibacterial properties, which can help heal cuts and protect them from infection., Heart disease is often caused by the buildup of plaque in the arteries leading to the heart. Turmeric's anti-inflammatory elements improve blood circulation while also keeping your arteries clear from plaque.Using turmeric for healthy blood circulation can reduce your risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke.
 Although there are no definitive studies on the role of turmeric as an inhibitor to cancer, preliminary results suggest that turmeric can slow or prevent the development of cancerous cells in the colon, prostrate and the lungs.Populations in India have some of the lowest rates of cancer in these organs (13 times lower than in the United States). Many researchers believe spices such as turmeric in curry dishes are responsible for these low rates.
Turmeric's strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are largely thought to be helpful in preventing cancer. Inflammation is often a factor in the development of cancerous tumor cells.Do not attempt to cure cancer using only natural vitamins and herbs. If you have cancer, you should work with an oncologist for treatment.

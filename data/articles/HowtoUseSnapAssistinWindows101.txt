 The title bar is the horizontal bar at the top of an open application window that contains the name of the program or app and, most of the time, the file name of the active document or website tabs (for browsers). When you left-click the title bar and hold down the mouse button, the app window resizes, and you can move it around the desktop screen.;
, When you drag the window to the left or right edge of the screen, you will see a transparent overlay (or boundary indicator) that will indicate where your window will be snapped.
 This will snap the window on the left or right half of the desktop screen. Releasing the mouse button will also activate Snap Assist.
 When you have snapped an application window to one side of the screen, you still have to fill up the other half.


If you have two or more open programs/applications, and you Snap one of them to the left or right side of the screen, Snap Assist will be triggered as soon as you release the mouse button. Snap Assist will offer you a list of open application windows (displayed as large thumbnails), any one of which you can choose to fill up the leftover space.
Click one of the thumbnails and that application will be snapped to the other half of the screen. Thus, you will have two applications side by side occupying equal halves of the desktop screen.

 In a sturdy glass bowl, mix 1 cup of regular white vinegar with one tablespoon of salt. Heat the mixture in a microwave until it is very warm, but not too hot to use. Stir the mixture.Only use this mixture for brass dog tags â€“ over time, exposure to salt and vinegar mixes can damage stainless steel., Place the brass ID tag in the mixture and leave it to soak. Check the tag every 10 minutes or so. Remove it once it looks clean.Given the strong smell of the vinegar, opt to place the bowl outside while the tag soaks if possible.
 Rinse the tag thoroughly, making sure to remove all traces of vinegar. Using a soft cloth or paper towel, pat the tag dry. Be sure to dry it completely as brass develops water spots very easily.

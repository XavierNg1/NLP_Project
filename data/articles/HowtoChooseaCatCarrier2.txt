 Nylon or soft carriers are great for cats that are calm when being transported. When purchasing the carrier, place a heavy book or object inside it to make sure the bottom doesn’t sag.If it does, then choose a nylon carrier that has a sturdier base, or choose a plastic carrier instead.
 Plastic carriers are a great choice for anxiety-ridden cats. They are sturdy enough to withstand an anxious cat’s scratching and thrashing. Additionally, plastic carriers with steel doors are much sturdier than ones that have plastic doors.Plastic carriers are also very easy to clean.
If you decide to purchase a plastic carrier, then make sure its handle is strong enough to support your cat’s weight.
 Cardboard boxes cannot withstand an anxious cat’s scratching. They are also very easy to escape from, and a cardboard box will not protect your car seats from urine or water spills. However, if you do not have a carrier and it is an emergency, then use a sturdy cardboard box to transport your cat to the vet.Make sure to place a thick blanket or towel in the bottom of the box, and cut breathing holes into the sides of the box.
Pillowcases and laundry baskets should not be used to transport your cat. Your cat can become injured or escape from these carriers very easily.

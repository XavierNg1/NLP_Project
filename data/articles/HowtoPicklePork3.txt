 This traditional method of pickling pork consists of submerging the pork in a highly saline liquid. At its simplest, it simply requires pork, a large non-reactive bowl (such as ceramic or stainless steel), water, and salt. However, the flavor of the pork can be greatly improved with the addition of sugar, herbs, and spices such as pepper, a bay leaf, garlic, allspice berries, onion, and dried thyme.In addition you may want to add potassium nitrate (also known as saltpeter) which inhibits the growth of certain bacteria, most importantly the bacteria responsible for botulism.
This method of pickling pork requires a significant number of days, specifically 7 - 14. Plan to make it far enough ahead so that it is ready when you want to use it.
, Stir the liquid so that the spices are evenly distributed and the salt dissolves in the water.


The amount of salt you need to add depends on the amount of water you are dissolving it in. To make sure your water is salty enough, take a raw egg and place it in the water. If it floats, your water is salty enough., Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator for 7 to 14 days.
 Like other methods of pickling pork, the pork needs to be cooked in some sort of heat before you eat it.


Traditionally this form of pickled pork, also known as salt pork, was fried with apples.However, this form of pickled pork will be excellent roasted or boiled as well.

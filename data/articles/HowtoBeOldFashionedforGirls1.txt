 Nancy Drew went with the 1940s innocent look, you can go for a 1970s style, but keep in mind you could be labeled "hippie" or "flower child". But if that was the look you were going for, then fine.;
, If you put your hair in a braid, ponytail, or up in any way, wear a ribbon. A ponytail is perfect for keeping longer hair controlled in your active life (they were very popular in the 1950's and 60's). Bangs are okay. Part your hair to the side and wear a headband, if you like and your hair is down. You can dye it strawberry blonde or red, if you want and get colored contacts for blue eyes.
 Take a shower at least once a day. Brush your teeth and wash your face twice a day == very drying, so moisturize your face and hands after washing. No old-fashioned girl would go out on the town with an unpleasant smell.
 Be modest and wear preppy clothes from stores like J. Crew, Lacoste, Ralph Lauren, Banana Republic, etc. If you want more high end clothing try Burberry, who are known for their plaid. Be original too. An interesting option is pleated or pencil skirts. Also, trench coats seem to always give an old fashioned glow. They add to the timeless sincerity of the outfit.
 Good posture will give the impression of self confidence (even if you don't feel that way on the inside). While walking, maintain a relaxed yet definitive upright posture: spine long, shoulders back, head level with the ground. This may feel awkward or overpowering to you when you first practice it, but keep on trying.
 Use clear coat on your fingernails; color or French pedicure on your toes. Don't let the skin around them get dry to the point that they crack, but push cuticles back -- and no biting your nails. If you polish them, go for a natural French manicure, clear polish, or even neutral, solid-colored polish (not bold, like red or blue or black). Don't let the polish chip off, and don't let your nails get too long. Nails should be in neutral colors and medium short in length.

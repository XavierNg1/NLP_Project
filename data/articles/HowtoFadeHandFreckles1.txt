 First step to prevention is to avoid the cause as much as you can. Do not go out if it is not really necessary.;
, Even if you are not going out all day, the sun's harmful rays can still reach you. UV rays can penetrate even on overcast and rainy days. So daily application of some SPF is a must.
Â There are gloves made of UV-protective materials sold online. You can wear them when you really have to go outside for a long period of time.

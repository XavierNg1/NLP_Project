 A lot of miscommunication in relationships stems from not being clear about what your boundaries are. Some people try to hint around their feelings while others assume their partner knows. Since privacy boundaries are so important, make sure to make time to tell your partner what your boundaries are.For example, you may want to tell your partner, “I want to discuss our privacy boundaries” or “We should discuss our feelings about privacy in the relationship.”

, When you are setting your privacy boundaries, make sure to tell your partner that you love and care about them. Your privacy boundaries should not make your partner feel alienated or violated. You should be focusing on healthy ways to be in a relationship.Try saying, “I love you and I care about you. However, I need you to respect my privacy” or “I care about you and want to share things with you, but please understand that there are some things I do not want to share with you.”

, When you set privacy boundaries, it should be done on both sides. You shouldn’t be the only one making relationship boundaries. Instead, you both should set boundaries together and respect each other’s wants and needs.Tell your partner, "I have stated my privacy boundaries. Now I am interested in what your privacy boundaries are so I can respect them. I understand they may be different than mine, and that is okay."
Be aware that your partner’s boundaries may be different than yours. For example, you may feel uncomfortable with them posting status updates or photos of you on social media while your partner doesn’t care. Your partner may want private time to themselves each day.

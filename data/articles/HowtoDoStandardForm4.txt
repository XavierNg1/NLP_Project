 If you have a polynomial, or an equation with multiple variable terms in it, the standard form of that equation is to arrange the variable terms so that degrees of each term flow from highest to lowest.



Example: Change the following into standard form: 8x + 2x3 - 4x4 + 7x2 + x5 = 10

, The equation may or may not already follow the standard form of a variable equation. If it does not, you will need to shift all terms to the left side so that only "0" remains on the right side of the equal sign.


Do this by following the same steps outlined in the "Standard Form of a Variable Equation" section. Add or subtract values to both sides of the equation nothing but "0" remains on the right side.
8x + 2x3 - 4x4 + 7x2 + x5- 10 = 10 - 10

8x + 2x3 - 4x4 + 7x2 + x5 - 10 = 0



, To put this equation in standard form, you will need to rearrange the terms so that the highest variable is first and the remaining variables descend in order.


If there is a non-variable term in your equation, it must be the last one.
You must also make sure that each variable keeps its charge (positive or negative) when you move it.

Example: 8x + 2x3 - 4x4 + 7x2 + x5 - 10

x5 - 4x4 + 2x3 + 7x2 + 8x - 10 = 0



, Once the variables are arranged in descending order, you have the standard form of the equation.



Example: The standard form of the equation is: x5 - 4x4 + 2x3 + 7x2 + 8x - 10 = 0

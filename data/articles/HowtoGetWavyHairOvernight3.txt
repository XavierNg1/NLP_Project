 This will make your hair easier to work with. It will also help your hair retain the waves longer. If your hair is dry, lightly mist your hair with some water. Try not to get it too wet, or it won't dry all the way and the waves won't stay.









If your hair does not hold a curl or wave well, try adding in a little styling cream or hairspray., You will end up with two sections: a left and a right. Since you will be working with one section at a time, you can keep the other one out of the way by wrapping a hair tie around it.









You don't have to part your hair down the middle; you can also part it to the left or right.
 You will end up with a sort of rope.
 Wrap a thin, elastic band around the end of the hair rope. Pull the hair rope up and around your head, like a headband. Place the end of the rope on top of your head, right above the forehead. Clip it to the rest of your hair using some bobby pins. Try making an X shape with your bobby pins; this will create the most secure hold.
 If you kept the hair out of the way with a hair tie, then remove the hair tie first. Twist your hair away from your face until you get a rope. Then, pull the rope up and over your head, and secure it to the rest of your hair with some bobby pins. Try to keep it either just in front or just behind the first rope.
 If you have thick, heavy hair, you might need more bobby pins to secure it. Secure the ropes to the sides of your head with two or three more bobby pins per side; you do not need any more pins on the top of your head.
 Pull out the bobby pins and unravel your hair. Use your fingers to comb out the twist, and break up the waves a little. If you need to, add some hairspray or styling cream to make the waves last longer.

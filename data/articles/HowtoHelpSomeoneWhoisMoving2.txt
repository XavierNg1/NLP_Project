, If you are not going to help with the physical move, feed the person who is moving and the moving crew.
 If your friend is renting a truck to haul all of his or her belongings, offer to drive him to the truck rental facility.
 Whether there are professional movers or just a bunch of friends helping out, give direction when asked.


Check with the person moving about furniture placement so you can help direct the movers at the new house.
 Offer to run errands, field phone calls or organize the set up of utilities and cable services while the furniture and boxes are being moved.
 If you are strong and healthy, offer to help with the heavy lifting. The more people who help move, the quicker it will go.


Take all necessary safety precautions. Wear a back brace or supports to protect your back and muscles. Do not lift anything too heavy on your own and be careful of steps, ladders and uneven surfaces.

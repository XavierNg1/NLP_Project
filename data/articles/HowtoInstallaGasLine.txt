 Most domestic gas lines use 1/2-inch (1.27 cm) through 1 1/2 inch (3.81 cm) black pipe, while large commercial projects sometimes use larger fittings up to 8 inch. You should buy a total pipe length of 6 to 12 inches (15.24 to 30.48 cm) longer than you need to account for pipe overlap and waste.;
, The valve will be at your gas meter on the side of your house and should shut off entirely with a quarter-turn. A position perpendicular to the pipe indicates a closed valve, but you should double-check by confirming that the meter is no longer moving.



Coat the threads of the pipe ends using pipe glue or tape. This is essential to establishing an airtight fit. If using tape, be sure that you wrap in a clockwise direction.
You can make your job easier by assembling some lengths of your gas line in your garage or shop, then moving them to the crawl space or wall where your gas lines run. Be wary of 90-degree bends if you do this, since those make turning the pipe to tighten it in exponentially more difficult.
 Thread it onto the end of the gas line using pipe glue or tape, just as with all the other connections. However, you will rarely need the pipe glue or tape for the final attachment to the appliance itself.
 If bubbles appear, you have a leak. Unscrew that section, strip off the pipe glue, and reattach with new sealant.
 Test your appliance to ensure the gas is flowing properly.

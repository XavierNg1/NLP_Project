 Open a new tab on your web browser and go to the address of your email service provider. Email accounts accessed online are called “webmails.” This is the most commonly used kind of email because it’s free and almost anyone can use it.


Popular email service providers include Google (Gmail), Yahoo (Yahoo Mail), AOL (AIM) and Microsoft (Outlook).
To find out the web address of your webmail, you may ask people you know who uses the same email service, contact the customer service department of the email provider you’re using, or just search for it.;
, Once you’ve opened the web address of your email provider, you should be able to see a login page. Enter your email account’s credentials (username and password) on the text fields provided.


All providers uses the same format of login pages for accessing webmail accounts, so it shouldn't be confusing when you’re switching from one webmail account to another.
 You should now be able to access your email’s inbox.

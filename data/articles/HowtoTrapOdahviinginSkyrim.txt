 It’s the second mission of the third act of the game’s main storyline. Right after completing the “Season Unending” quest (and receiving the “Words of Power” shout from Esbern), head back to Whiterun, enter Dragonsreach (the main keep of the city), and talk to Jarl Balgruuf the Greater to help set up a trap for Odahviing.;
, Take the stairs on the left of the halls and make your way up to the second floor to find a large roofed area with a balcony at the end of it. Here is where you need to trap Odahviing.
 Make your way to the balcony, open your in-game menu and select “Magic.” Select “Shout” from the menu panel on the right-hand side of the game screen and choose “Words of Power.”


Press the Action button on your controller or keypad to use the shout. Wait for a few moments, and you’ll eventually see a dragon off a distance coming your way.
 The dragon will simply fly around the balcony. To force him to land, open your in-game menu and select “Shout” from the menu panel on the right-hand side of the game screen, and choose “Dragonrend” (a shout given to you during the earlier missions).


Aim at the dragon and press the Action button on your controller or keypad to use the shout. If you aimed correctly, Odahviing will land on the balcony by force.
 Once Odahviing lands, take a few steps back inside the the large hall. The dragon will follow you inside and will trigger the traps prepared by the guards. Odahviing will be instantly trapped and won’t be able to fly out.

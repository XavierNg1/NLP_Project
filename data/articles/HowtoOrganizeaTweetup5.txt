 Be constantly positive and encouraging. Many people will balk about meeting up with people they don't know, or don't know very well. Even the best of us can be crowd shy. But if people read about how much fun people are having and how interesting the event is, some may be curious enough to come along or will at least be aware that your next Tweetup is definitely worth attending.


In the days after the event, continue tweeting about it. Mention to particular individuals how great it was to meet them, make comments about things learned and suggestions for future get-togethers. This will help to maintain the momentum and shows everyone that the event was a success and that it was taken seriously.

 Bananas that have not fully ripened will not ripen correctly if frozen. As soon as a banana has ripened, it can technically be frozen. Freezing a banana just before it becomes overripe or during the beginning stages of being overripe tends to preserve a stronger flavor, though, and is generally preferred.

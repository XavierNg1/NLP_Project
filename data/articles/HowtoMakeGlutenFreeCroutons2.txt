 Turn the oven on to 325 degrees F (160 C). Get out a baking sheet and spray it with extra virgin olive oil spray. If you don't have spray, you could use a pastry brush to brush a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil over the sheet pan., Put 4 cups (140 g) of fresh, gluten-freed bread cubes onto the baking sheet. Pour 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil over the cubes. Use your fingers or a spoon to toss the bread and oil so the cubes are evenly coated.You can drizzle another tablespoon of oil, if the bread absorbs most of the oil.
 Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning, 1/4 teaspoon of garlic salt, 1 pinch salt, and 1 pinch of dried oregano over the bread cubes. Toss the seasonings and bread cubes until the cubes are evenly coated with the seasonings., Spread the cubes out into a single layer on the baking sheet. Put the sheet in the preheated oven and bake the croutons for 10 minutes. Stir the croutons and return them to the oven. Bake the croutons for another 6 to 10 minutes. They should turn dark golden brown. Cool the croutons before serving them.You can store the croutons in an airtight container once they've cooled completely. Store the croutons for up to one day.

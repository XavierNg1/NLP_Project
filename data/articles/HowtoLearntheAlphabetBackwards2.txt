 Chunking is a mnemonic device that helps you remember groups of letters. Look at the alphabet backwards. Notice whatever letters go together to form words. For example, f, e, d are all in a row. The word “fed” is easier to remember than the individual letters.This is similar to combining words except you’re combining letters without initial images. Because it doesn’t involve as many images, it may increase your recall speed.
 Some letter sequences won’t translate directly to words like “fed.” To do this, try a more creative approach. One way to do is to make a sound out of the letters. For example, VUTS might make a sound like an electrical current. Do whatever is most memorable to you.Another way is to fill in the gaps with individual words. While WVUT can relate to West Virginia, Utah, RQP can relate to running to the queue and taking your place.
 Combine all mnemonics together. The more you are able to link the letters into vivid images, the more easily you’ll recall them. For instance, if you remember MLKJIHG as Martin Luther King doing a jig, you’ll instantly recall those six letters instead of trying to recall them one at a time.
 Many people use the alphabet song to remember the alphabet forwards. You can do this to learn the alphabet backwards. Speak the letters or the words. Use the tones of the letters or words to create your song.


Even if you only recite the letters with a simple but consistent melody, this strengthens your memory., Once you’ve found a way to combine all the letters of the alphabet into a story, practice with it. It can take some editing and rehearsal to make the story feel memorable. Recall each part of the story one word at a time. When a significant word comes up, pull out the next letters in the alphabet.

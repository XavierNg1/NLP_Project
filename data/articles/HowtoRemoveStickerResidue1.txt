 Ensure the tape makes a tight ring around your index and middle finger with the sticky side facing out. Press it against the surface and pull away. Notice the residue sticking to the tape, and repeat until you’ve lifted off as much residue as possible.


If the tape loses its stickiness before you’re finished, you can either rotate the ring or use a new length of tape.
 You can either use wet wipes from the cleaning supply aisle or sanitizing wipes. Rub until you no longer feel any stickiness. You might have to let the surface dry and rub a few more times to completely rid it of residue.

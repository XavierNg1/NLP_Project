 Your dog will trust you and the world a lot more when it is not confronted daily with things that remind it of past trauma. Some incidents are unpredictable, but do what you can to minimize exposure to trauma-inducing triggers.If stress-based triggers can be avoided, try to remove them from the dog’s vicinity. If, for example, you have a puppy mill rescue who cannot stand the sight of a crate, remove dog crates from the area where the rescued dog normally spends its time.
If you cannot remove certain stress-based triggers, such as the noise caused by fireworks during holiday celebrations, talk to your vet about treatment options.
 Socializing an emotionally fragile dog allows them to work out their fears and frustrations with their peers. Take your dog to the dog park, set up one-on-one play dates, or have them walk alongside another dog during their daily walks.If group situations make your dog nervous, it might be best to start your dog off by walking them with another dog or setting up a one-on-one play date.
If your dog displays any aggressive behavior toward other pets or people, it may be necessary to work with a trainer or behavioral specialist before you continue socializing.
 Being introduced to new people can often be a struggle for dogs coming from emotionally abusive situations. Help counteract this by introducing positive people who can offer affection and praise to your dog.Stage meetings with friends or family. Instruct them as to the best ways to approach your dog, and provide them with treats and toys they can use to help win your dog’s affection.
Try to make a point of introducing your dog to people it will see regularly first. Having your dog bond with someone who will not be around long could cause greater stress for your pet.

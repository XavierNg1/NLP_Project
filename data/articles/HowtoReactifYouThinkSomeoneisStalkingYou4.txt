 Call a crisis hotline and speak to someone who can help you learn more about stalking laws in your location, help you develop some strategies to stay safe, and refer you to other services. One number to call is the Victim Connect Resource Center at 855-4-VICTIM.
 Your stalker may be breaking anti-stalking laws, or may have committed other crimes like damaging your property. Talk to the police about what you can do. They will open a file and advise you of the best precautions to take and the types of information you have that will be most helpful for them., If you know the identity of your stalker, you can file for a restraining order, also known as an order of protection, against them. You can discuss this with a law enforcement official or your victim advocate.

 Record and document any threatening texts, emails, or phone calls. Forward them to the police officer assigned to your case. Do not throw away any items the stalker may have given you; instead, pass them along to the police.Take a screenshot of any website harassment to send to the police. You can also report harassment to the owner of the website, who may be able to help you or law enforcement track down the location of the perpetrator.
If you suspect the stalker has caused damage to your property, file a police report (for insurance purposes as well as evidence), and be sure to photograph the damage.
 Record details of every encounter with the stalker. Document date and time, what transpired, and your follow-up with law enforcement.


If anyone else in your life routinely sees the stalker, like a coworker or roommate, ask them if they would be willing to create an incident log of their own sightings/encounters for additional evidence.

 If you're doing a stuffed tomato dish, cut the tomato in a way that preserves the shape of both halves of the tomato. To start, set your tomato on a cutting board with the stem facing up.Roll the tomato to the side so the stem is pointing to the right.
Cut the tomato down the middle.
 Roll each half onto its rounded side. When you look on the inside of the tomato halves, you'll notice each half has four distinct sections. These sections contain the seeds, and are divided by pale red barriers. Keep these barriers intact when you seed your tomato, as you'll use them when stuffing it later on., Take a small spoon and carefully scoop out each section of your tomato. Go slowly, as to avoid damaging the barriers between the sections. Make sure to scrape the spoon along the bottom of the tomato to make sure you thoroughly remove all seeds., When you're finished, you can discard the seeds. If you're planning on planting tomato seeds, however, you may want to store them in an airtight sealable container for future use.

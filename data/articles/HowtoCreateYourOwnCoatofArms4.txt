 Supporters can be animals, birds, or persons that appear to be supporting or holding up the shield. This is an important aspect of the coat of arms, as it takes up as much space as the shield itself! Think about what symbolizes you.





If you feel like you are a bold, strong, fiery person, you could choose dragons to support your shield.
If you feel you are quiet and wise, you could choose sparrows or another type of bird to support the shield.
Your supporters do not have to be two of the same kind of animal or person. For example, you could use a lion and a griffin.
 The compartment usually consists of simple leaves or branches that take up the space between the shield and the banner below. You could also try ribbons or bows.
 The banner is a pretty simple ribbon that displays your motto. For the motto, you can use an inspirational saying, such as “Believe in yourself and you will be unstoppable” or it could have your full name on it. Remember that the coat of arms represents you, so put something on the banner that is meaningful to you.









You could also use a saying in another language or use a quote. You could consult with your family to come up with a statement or saying.
 Once you have added these last finishing touches, look it over to see if there is anything else you would like to add. If not, sit back and enjoy your new coat of arms!

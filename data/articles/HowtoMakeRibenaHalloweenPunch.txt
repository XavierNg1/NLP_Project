, This will dilute the mixture, so if you want the drink stronger, pour in less lemonade or add more neat Ribena.
 Or add chopped-up pieces of fruit.
 Some examples of gross edible items include:


Eyeballs made from black grape or olive halves attached to kiwifruit halves.

Frozen hand made from a strong solution of Ribena (so that it doesn't dilute the flavor as it melts)
Gummy worms or gel-based candies in the shapes of things such as brains, fingers, etc.
False teeth candies.
 Cover with a lid or some plastic food wrap prior to serving.
 Place in the center of the table or buffet setting, along with an appropriate serving spoon or cup. Happy Halloween!

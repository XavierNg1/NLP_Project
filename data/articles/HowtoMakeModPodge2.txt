 Because the Mod Podge you will be making in this section uses flour and sugar, the finished texture may be a little grainy. Keep this in mind when using this version as a sealer.
 You will need a clean jar with a tight-fitting lid. It should be able to hold 12 ounces (355 milliliters). The jar can be made out of glass or plastic.
 Sift 1 ½ cups (210 grams) of flour and ¼ cup (56.25 grams) of granulated sugar into a pot. Do not place the pot on the store, and do not turn the stove on just yet.
 Pour 1 cup (225 milliliters) of cold water into the pot and beat rapidly with a whisk to mix everything together and get rid of any clumps.


Consider adding ¼ teaspoon of oil. This will help make the product glossier in the end.
 Use medium heat and do not let the contents of the pot boil. You want to end up with a thick, glue-like consistency. If the mixture starts to become too thick, then add more water and keep stirring.


Consider adding vinegar. Adding ¼ teaspoon of vinegar can help control fungus and mold from developing in your Mod Podge. If you choose to add vinegar, do so after you have removed the pot from the stove, and give the Mod Podge one, final stir., Once the mixture has thickened, turn the stove off, and set the pot down onto a heat-resistant surface. Let the mixture cool completely before proceeding to the next steps, or else the Mod Podge may begin to ferment.
 Hold the pot over your jar and carefully tip the contents into the jar. You can use a spoon or spatula to help guide the mixture. If necessary, you may give the mixture a stir once everything is in the jar.
 Once again, make sure that your Mod Podge is completely cool before you place the lid on. Because you have made your Mod Podge out of natural ingredients, you will need to store it in a cool place, such as a refrigerator. Use it within a week or two. If it starts to rot and mold, discard it.

 A normal one is about 5 blocks high, and is 5 blocks wide (5x5).
 An easy way it to go inside (make sure you have a door), and stack up the blocks then mine them, leaving the highestÂ one left. Climb on the roof using steps, then continue building., I'd make sure it's morning, just in case you see an Enderman.,, You now have a light that sticks out of your roof like you may have in your house.

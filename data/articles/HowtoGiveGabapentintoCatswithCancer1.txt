 Measure out the appropriate dose of Gabapentin into an oral syringe. Place the medication next to the spot where you will be administering it. A counter top or table are good options, as they will allow you to give your cat the liquid without having to bend down to their level., Bring your cat to the spot where you will administer the Gabapentin. Pet your cat to calm it down. If you suspect that your cat will put up a fight, wrap a thick towel around it, which will restrict movement and reduce the cat’s anxiety., Place your cat in front of you with it facing away from you, with its hindquarters leaning against you. Gently tilt you cat’s head upwards and position the end of the syringe at the back corner of its mouth. Dispense the medication into the space between your cat’s cheek and gums., Immediately reward your cat by petting it and feeding it a treat. If your cat is wrapped in a towel, unwrap it immediately and feed it another treat. Pet and praise your cat to create positive associations with the process, which will occur regularly.

 Feel lucky that you got time to explore yourself, remember that everyone is a master of hidden talents. You just need to unveil them. It may sound hollow, but if you have to live in this period, why not to make the best out of it?;
, Take the time off not as a holiday, but as a time to educate yourself. Take online classes or try to get a shadow job in your study direction to help you increase your skills and maybe learn some new ones to add to your resumé.
 This may sometimes do you no good, but just remind you about your problems. Use these devices only to improve your skills or look for a new job. Avoid lying around all day watching movies or playing games. This will discourage you from working again.
 While you are job hunting, it can also be a good idea to take a break every once in a while and try out some of your hobbies to see if you can't make a living out of them. It can be writing, cooking, singing, dancing, playing a musical instrument, a sport, photography, art and craft, etc. It may help you realize, what fascinates you the most. You should not just stick to one hobby, even if you find it interesting in the beginning. Let other fields have a chance to express their importance to you. Don't be over satisfied.
 It will help you in your overall development. Extract time out of your routine for reading. May it be news, articles, novels, stories, poetry, etc. Reading will increase your grammar, spelling and will also keep you busy for a while.
 This will help you express your thoughts. Try recollecting the good moments of that day. This may include a kiss you shared, a cup of coffee you spilled, sleeping in late or anything else that happened throughout your day.

 Try not to borrow ideas from other authors, such as if you have a forest, try to not make the name, Gloomwood. Or a range of mountains, the Foggy Mountains. Words like "gloom" and "foggy" have been used and stretched over too many novels. Try something like "The Impassable Mountains". After you have created the geographical world, divide your world into the Governmental world, add kingdoms and countries, and create races to inhabit these.;
, Norse Sagas are wonderful resources for fantasy writing, even J. R. R. Tolkien used things from the Norse. Such as Mirkwood, was in the Volsung Saga, as "Myrkwood". Borrow from the ancients as much as you like, but DO NOT use other author's writings.
 Take notice of peoples habits in real life, such as chewing their fingernails, or biting one's lips. To make your characters seem real, you must create unique and original people. Taking note of people's talking habits are also great ways to define different characters.
 A good way to come up with a high quality plot is to use the same technique as in step two. Celtic Myths, Norse Sagas (especially the Poetic Eddas) are good writings to find ideas in.
 You may choose to type on a computer or write in an exercise book. Some authors prefer an exercise book as it is a more practical way to write, and the words might just flow through the pen, onto the paper.


Write on a regular basis. One person once said, if you write seven good sentences a day, eventually you will have a good novel. And it is very true! If you write a little a day, you will (if you stick to it) eventually have a novel.
 Re-write! These are vital steps, check grammar, spelling and other things, but if you have no time, hire an editor, they will fix these things up for you.
 Most publishers won't even look at a submission without an agent.
 Remember, be ready for a simple 'no'. Not everyone's first novel gets published.

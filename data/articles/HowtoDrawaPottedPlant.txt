 Get a nice sheet of paper, a sharpened pencil, a rubber. If you wish to make it colourful, you could get some colours too. For starting an artwork, you always need to gather you supplies so that you can concentrate on drawing rather than your stuff.;
, This would act as the foundation of the drawing. Always remember, never ever use a ruler for drawing a line or any shape. If you can't draw a straight line without a ruler, a little practice could help you.
 After all, the pot should be on something. It can't float in air. But for right now, don't make a very detailed table. make it simple. By the way, don't use a ruler for it. For drawing the table draw an elliptical shape and draw another under its lower half to give it a 3D look. Draw the leg of the table under it. You could draw the foot anyway you want. You could also make a rectangular table if you want.
 It is the leaves that could make anything look like a plant. Don't draw very detailed leaves just draw some spades around the line.
 We don't want the stem to look 1D. It should look 3D.
 Erase the upper part of the pot and draw an ellipse. Join the sides of the pot with the ellipse and then draw a smaller ellipse inside the larger one. Give effects to it to make it look like soil and draw some small lines on the spot where the plant is attached with soil to make it look irregular. Make the spade on the plant look like leaves by drawing a little line in the middle part of each leaf. Make the ends of the leaves rounded.
 Draw some rounded lines on the upper part of the table to make it look like wood. Add some lines on the leg too. Make it look irregular like wood and not flawless like marble.

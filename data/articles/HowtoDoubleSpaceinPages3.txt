 The “View” button will look like a small square with an extra right angle in the top left corner. It is white and blue, and located within the toolbar. From here, select “Show Ruler”. This will ensure the ruler is displaying within Pages., At the top of the text page, there is a ruler running horizontally. This ruler is used to set page margins, paragraph indents, and tab stops. If you wish to enter and extra tab stop, click the ruler at the desired location.Any pre-existing tab stop icons will be small blue shapes. The left-aligned tab will be a right-facing arrow. The centre-aligned tab will be a diamond shape. The decimal-aligned tab will be a small circle, and the right aligned tab is a left-facing arrow., To change the alignment of the current tab stops, double click the tab stop icon. This will bring up one of the tab icons. If the one you wish to change does not show, keep double clicking. Pages will cycle through the tabs and simply stop double clicking when you see the alignment you wish to change.
 After the tab icon you wish to change has come up, you can drag the icon to the left or right of its current position on the ruler. Once content with positioning, simply continue on within Pages.


To drag, directly click onto the icon and while holding the click, move right or left. You may drag the icon as many times as desired.
If you wish to remove a tab stop completely, drag the stop directly downwards from the ruler. Drag until the tab stop disappears from the ruler. Once it has disappeared, you can release your click. The tab stop will be removed., In the “Text” panel of the “Format Inspector,” click “Layout” to change the default setting of tab spacing. From “Layout,” use the up and down arrowheads to increase and decrease the default spacing for tabs.

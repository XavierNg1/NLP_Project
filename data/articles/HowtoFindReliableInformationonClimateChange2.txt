 If an article or journal does not say that it is a peer reviewed or scholarly publication, you should find information elsewhere. Though there can be factual information in these publications, there is no verification that it is factual. Publications that do not undergo a peer review process can be false or misleading., Many different industries and companies are affected by the public facts and opinions on climate change.You may notice articles that seem to be very pointed in one direction or the other. In this case, it is best to find other information, or at least to make an effort to find information supporting the statements made by the article.For example, articles published by companies that provide fossil fuels may be more likely to downplay the human involvement in climate change.
 A reliable article will list sources or citations. This gives you an idea of where the author(s) obtained the information set forth in the article. You can evaluate the validity of the article based on the quality of sources that are provided.


This is particularly important for articles on the internet. Anyone can post any opinion they want on the internet, making it difficult to decide what information to trust and what to discard.

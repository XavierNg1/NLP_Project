 One way to moisturize your scalp is to apply coconut oil before you wash your hair. Massage the coconut oil into your hair; it helps to warm it up a little first. Cover your hair, and leave the coconut oil on for about 45 minutes. Then hop in the shower and shampoo as normal., Another scalp treatment that some people have good luck with is one part apple cider vinegar and one part water. Spritz it on your scalp, being careful not to get it in your eyes, and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Rinse it out, and shampoo your hair afterwards., You're trying to prevent a dry scalp, and that means providing hydration. A shampoo that hydrates your hair will also hydrate your scalp. If you have dry hair and scalp, pick a shampoo that says it's for "dry hair.", The scalp naturally produces oil, which moves down into your hair, too. However, if you wash your hair too often, you're rinsing away that natural oil. Skip shampooing your hair every day, instead doing it every couple of days.If you still want that fresh feeling even when you don't wash your hair, just use a rinse-out conditioner instead.
 Conventional wisdom states you should just put conditioner on the bottom half of your hair; however, if you're trying to prevent a dry scalp, you need to condition your scalp as well. Conditioning your scalp will help keep it hydrated., When you use shampoo or conditioner, rinse them out of your hair well. Any shampoo left behind could contribute to itchiness, which in turn could make you scratch. That could lead to a dry, itchy scalp overall., Scalp lotions are designed to keep you moisturized, preventing dryness. You apply it just to your scalp, rubbing it in as you would any lotion. You can find lotions made specifically for your scalp, but other thick creams may work as well., Heat from a blowdryer or other styling tools can dry out your hair. Whenever possible, allow your hair to air dry, or use the "cool" setting on your hairdryer.

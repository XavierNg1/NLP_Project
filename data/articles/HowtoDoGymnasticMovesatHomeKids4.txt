 This is also called the "straddle position." They should be much further apart than your shoulders. Try to make your legs as wide as you can go while comfortably standing with your legs straight., Allow your feet to slide further apart. Until you are well-practice, take this step slowly. Keep your legs straight. Stop immediately if you feel any sort of pain. Forcing a stretch can cause injury., Once you've gone down as far as you can, hold that position for as long as you can. Maintaining this stretch will help improve flexibility and strength. Use your hands for support if you feel wobbly., Unless you are already athletic, you will probably not be able to do the splits on your first try. As you build up strength and flexibility, you will be able to stretch your legs further apart and get closer to the ground. This may take you a while, so try your best to be patient.

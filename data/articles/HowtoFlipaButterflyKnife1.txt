 Make sure you start with a closed knife. If the knife is already open you should find someone who understand a Butterfly Knife to close it for you. The knife has a dull side and a sharp side and you always want to keep your fingers away from the sharp side. Look at the anatomy of the knife and determine which direction the sharp side would close into. The knife slips into a groove inside the handles on both sides.You want to hold the handle that would house the dull side of the knife.


Even if you are not using a sharp knife, this is the proper technique.;
, Hold the knife directly out in front of you pointing forward. Now flick your wrist back. The flick of your wrist should be similar to the reverse motion of casting a fishing line.









When you flip your wrist back the knife will open and the handle of dangerous side will hit you between your thumb and your forefinger. Keep your hand where it is. , This time flick your wrist downward so that the knife closes again. The knife should be a similar position to when you started now.
 The last time you flipped the knife up the handle hit you on the thumb and forefinger. Flip the knife up in the exact same way but open your thumb and move it to the side this time. This will allow the handle of the dangerous side to smack into the handle that you are holding, engaging the knife. 








Once you have flipped the knife up into place close your thumb over both handles.

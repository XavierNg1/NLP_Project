 Look at the keyboard and study what keys are on it. Try to name the keys too, though, you may not need to name the letters. Name the keys such as Shift, Enter, Backspace, etc. Study the spacebar and arrow keys too. Study all the keys on a keyboard until you're ready to start typing.;
, Use this guide to help:


Your pinky goes on the letters Q, A, and Z for left hand, and P,Â ;, and / for the right hand.
For the left hand, the ring finger goes on W, S, and X. For right hand, it goes on O, L, and the period (.).
For the finger between the index finger and ring finger on the left hand, that goes on E, D, and C. For the right, K, the comma (,), and I.
The index fingers get extra letters (they get 3 more than the others). Left hand index finger goes on R, F, V, T, G, and B, and the right goes on U, J, M, Y, H, and N.
The thumb hits the spacebar.
 If you know all the letters and other keys and also know where your fingers go, practice on the keyboard.

 The purificator is the smallest of the small linens, and the post Communion veil is the largest of the small linens. Both can be either square or rectangular, and both have an embroidered cross in the center.The purificator is the linen used to dry the holy vessels during Holy Communion.
The post Communion veil is used to cover the chalice after Holy Communion has concluded.;
, Lay either linen flat with the cross upright but facing down.Smooth out any wrinkles with your hands.
 Fold the right side in toward the left.


The right-most third of the material should be folded over the center third, leaving only the left-most third visible.
 Fold the left side in toward the right.


The edge of this left-most third should meet the bend of your first fold. The bend of this fold should meet the edge of the original right side of the linen.
Crease both folds with your fingers to lightly crease them before continuing.
 Fold the bottom third of the linen up so that it covers the center third of the cloth.
 Fold down the remaining top third of the linen so that it completely covers the material from your previous fold.


If done correctly, the purificator and/or post Communion veil should be folded into nine even square sections.
 Use your fingers to press all the folded edges into firm creases.


Flip the linen over so that the embroidered cross is now on top.
Press the creases with an iron before putting the linen into long-term storage.
This step completes the process. The purificator or post Communion veil should be ready to store.

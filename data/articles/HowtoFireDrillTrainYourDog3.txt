 Every floor of your house or apartment should have a working smoke alarm installed on a ceiling. Be sure to test them and replace their batteries regularly.It’s a good idea to replace the batteries in your smoke alarms twice a year.
If you’re often away from your home, it may be worth investing in a monitored smoke alarm system. That way, any time a smoke alarm is triggered in your absence, a service would immediately dispatch first responders to check on your house and rescue your dog if need be.
 Use stickers placed on a window near your front door to notify first responders about any dogs or other pets living in your home. The sticker should state what kind of pets and how many of each you have in the family.The ASPCA provides these window-cling stickers at no charge in their free pet rescue packs, which you can order online.You may also obtain pet alert stickers in person from your local firehouse., Things are chaotic during a fire. In case your dog is lost in the melee, be sure to keep their microchipping and/or ID tags up to date with your current contact information.


Microchips correspond to an electronic database with owner information. Be sure to apprise your vet and/or the company where you purchased your microchip of any updates to your address or phone number.
 Creating a doggy door that leads into a fenced yard is a good way to ensure that your pet can get out of the house in the event of a fire, even when you’re not there.If you crate your dog during your absence, it’s wise to keep the crate near an exterior door, so that they can be easily rescued in the event of a house fire.

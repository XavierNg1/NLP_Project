 After the initial feeling of pain, itching, tingling, numbness, or sensitivity, look for a red rash to develop on that area of your skin. This usually occurs a few days after the initial discomfort.Some people get the feeling of burning or pain and never develop the shingles rash.
 The shingles rash forms blisters (or vesicles), which are small painful swellings in the skin filled with fluid. Shingles blisters generally appear in a group in a single area on the body.


Do not touch or scratch your blisters â€“ the fluid in the blisters contains the virus, and you can spread infection to other areas of your body. Keep your blisters covered and wash your hands often to minimize the risk of spreading the virus.
 Shingles blisters usually crust over and form scabs 7-10 days after they appear. These should clear up in about 2-4 weeks, and the scabs should fall off. Do not pull these off yourself, let it occur naturally.

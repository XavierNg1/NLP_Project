 First, if you’re making marshmallows to top another treat like hot chocolate or open-faced s’mores, make sure that your snowflakes will fit inside or on top of the container. Use the top of the mug or cracker to trace a border for each snowflake on parchment paper. Then trace an outline for your snowflake within that border., Transfer your wet marshmallow into a piping bag as soon as it’s ready. Then pipe the marshmallow into each outline immediately. Don’t dawdle, because the marshmallow will start to dry pretty quickly, which means you have to work fast while it’s still wet.If you’ve never piped icing before, this method isn’t advisable for beginners since you have to work so quickly. You might prefer to cut out your snowflakes instead.
 Let them sit for one hour to set and stiffen. Then dust their tops with with either cornstarch or Mochiko, flip them over, and do the same to their bottoms. Transfer them to a sieve and shake off any excess dusting. Then either enjoy them straight away or seal them in an airtight container to be stored in the fridge for up to one week.

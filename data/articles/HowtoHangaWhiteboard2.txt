 Locate a spot on your wall that will fit your dimensions, and give it a quick wipe down with some water--or water and vinegar, if it is particularly dirty. Allow the space to dry before you continue.

To expedite the drying process, you can wipe the area with a clean, microfiber cloth. Terrycloth might leave behind residue that would make sticking difficult.
 Whether you are using sticker hooks or screw hooks, place your hooks on the wall. Measure to make sure they are spaced evenly, and placed at the right height.When you place your hooks, determine whether you want them to show above the board, or you want them to sit behind the board. This will determine where you place the eyelets.
If you use screw hooks, refer to the steps in the previous method to make sure the hooks are installed properly.
 Measure the space between the hooks to make sure the space between your whiteboard eyelets will line up. This measurement has to be exact, and the space between all hooks should be measured., Using the measurements taken in the previous step, affix your loops or eyelets to the back of your whiteboard, making sure they are straight and pressed firmly to the frame.Place your eyelets as straight as possible, as even a slight slant can make your board sit cock-eyed on the wall, or can make the hook unusable.
 Using the hooks and eyelets, hang your board on the wall. Place a level on top to ensure your board is straight. Check to make sure each hook is properly inserted into each eyelet; only having one or two hooks properly installed will weaken your boardâ€™s stability.

 Ask yourself about the underlying causes of your own personal manipulation. Perhaps you have a tough time saying no, period. Or you feel sorry for a certain person. Either way, it is important to recognize the root of the issue (and the role you may play in your own manipulation) so that you can work on preventing it in the future.


Recognizing the reasons you feel compelled to help, or are easily manipulated, will help you avoid similar situations in the future.
 You don’t owe a manipulative person anything, despite how they may try to make you feel. You are free to choose how you spend your time and with whom. If you feel like you are being constantly manipulated by a particular person, choose to avoid them.This doesn’t mean that you have to end the friendship or relationship. Just be more in control of how often you see the person and under what circumstances.
 Learn how to detect early signs of manipulative behavior. For example, a person like this will want to influence your appearance. They will constantly give you "suggestions" as to how you should change your looks and personality. Some examples of this are:


"Are you really gonna wear that dress to the party?"
"You should stop laughing that loud."
"You shouldn't wear loose jeans. No one likes a girl that wears loose jeans."

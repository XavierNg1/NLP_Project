 If you don't like using keyboard shortcuts, or want to save your screenshots in a format other than PNG, you can use the Preview tool.


You can find the Preview tool in the Utilities folder in your Applications folder.
 If you select "From Selection", your cursor will change into a crosshair and you can create a rectangle to make the screenshot. If you select "From Window", the cursor will change into a camera and you can click the window you want to capture. If you select "From Entire Screen", Preview will capture your entire screen.
 Once you've captured your screenshot, it will appear in the Preview window. You can review it to ensure that the right parts have been captured and that it isn't showing anything you want to hide.
 Click the "File" menu and select "Export As". You can use the pop-out menu and select the format that you want to save it as, including JPG, PDF, and TIFF.

  Is it an advertisement for a business, a special photo such as a bride and groom at their wedding, a souvenir series of photos from a family reunion, a message or a reminder to attend a special event (such as next year's family reunion)?   
,  Sign up for advertisements from and open accounts with online printers. Check their FaceBook pages. If time is not of the essence patiently wait until you find a printer offering free magnets and free photo uploads.  Once the special arrives order immediately as specials only come a few times per year and do not last long when they do come. ,  If you are including photos clearly identify them.  If they need touching up or background removal do that work. ,  Write down whatever text you want to have for your messages consistent with your objectives. ,,  Sign onto your printer's web site.  They will most likely offer a series of templates (including calendars) you can use to design your magnet.  They will also probably offer the opportunity to build your own design from scratch using their tools and the opportunity  to upload your own design.  If this is your first magnet, you might want to start with customizing their design rather than starting from a blank magnet.  You will probably be able to add extra photos, graphics and text to their design as desired. ,  Use the tools provided by your printer.  Remember to save often in case you lose your Internet connection or make a serious error in editing.  Developing a magnet can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.  Remember to save your work when you are done.,,,,  Your printer may, for example, be offering a special on business cards, magnets and post cards all at the same time.  Sometimes, they offer all of the items free (except for shipping, processing and handling).,,,

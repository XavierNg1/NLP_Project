 This will allow the Internet to search for and list websites that display the fax number you have entered.


Review the search results that are displayed after entering the fax number. You may find the name of the organization who owns the fax number in the search results.
If the fax number you entered does not display in any search results, try using variations of its format. For example, if you are searching for 555-555-5555, either remove the dashes from the fax number (555 555 5555), condense the fax number without any breaks (5555555555), or add parenthesis around the area code (555)555-5555.
 This procedure will allow you to enter the fax number into a directory that may display the name of the business that owns the fax number.


Go to any search engine and enter keywords such as "fax number reverse lookup" to locate a website with a reverse lookup tool. You can also visit the "411" website featured in the Sources section of this article, then click on the "Reverse Phone" tab to use the reverse lookup feature.

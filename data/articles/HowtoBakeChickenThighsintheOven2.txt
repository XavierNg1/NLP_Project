 Rinse the chicken thighs in cold water. Trim dangling pieces of fat and skin. Pat the chicken dry using paper towels.
 Add olive oil.
 Place the chicken thighs skin-side down in the heated olive oil. Cook for three minutes. Turn the chicken pieces and cook on the other side for three minutes. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 Put the lid on the dutch oven and place it in the oven. Bake the chicken for 30 minutes.
 While the chicken is baking, set a small saucepan on the stove over medium heat. Add the garlic, honey, soy sauce, and cayenne pepper. Bring to a light simmer and turn off the heat.
 Remove the chicken from the oven. Pour the honey garlic glaze over the chicken, covering every piece.
 Place the dutch oven back in the oven without a lid. Bake the chicken for an additional 15 minutes, or until the skin is brown and crispy. Use a meat thermometer to test the chicken for doneness.

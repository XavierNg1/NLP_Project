 This is so you can upgrade your weapons and armor for better killing and better tools for easy material access. You are also going to need to get an enchanting table and bookcases., That small 8 wide farm won't support an entire clan of people, so making a wider and longer farm is necessary. You are going to need to make the farm very long and wide, so more torches and glowstone is needed., Your one-person faction isn't going to last long in a large raid, and more people means more work being done. Start recruiting people to help you with your efforts, but be aware these people could just be scouts or looking to rob you. Don't purposely start wars with factions you know you can't beat, be smart with who you raid and how you talk to people.

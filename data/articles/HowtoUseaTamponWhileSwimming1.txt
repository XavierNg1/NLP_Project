 You should be comfortable with wearing a tampon regularly before you venture into the pool. To use a tampon, just pull it out of its wrapper, find a comfortable position that allows you to position the thicker applicator half of the tampon into your vagina, and then press the thinner applicator end into the top half until it goes as far up as it can, moving the tampon further up your vagina. Once you feel that the tampon is firmly in place, gently remove the applicator.


You should feel the tampon move all the way into your vagina and out of the applicator. If you don't push it back far enough, it'll come out with the applicator.;
, Walk around, sit, and just move around a bit to make sure you can't feel the tampon in your vagina. If it hurts or you can still feel it, try again or insert your finger in your vagina to push it up further. Sometimes, if the tampon cannot be further inserted your period may be coming to an end. In that case, you should avoid trying to force it if it hurts too much.

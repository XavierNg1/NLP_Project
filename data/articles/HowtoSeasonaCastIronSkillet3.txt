 Cast iron is easiest to clean right after cooking, before the food has a chance to become one with the skillet. As soon as it is cool enough to touch, wipe out the food remnants with a towel and rinse it with hot water.


If there's a layer of caked-on food at the bottom of the pan, use a mixture of kosher salt and vinegar to scrub it off with a paper towel. Afterward, rinse the skillet with hot water to make sure you wash off all traces of the vinegar.
Caked-on food can also be burned off. Place your skillet in an oven turned to very high heat. The food will turn to ash, which can be brushed off once the skillet has cooled down. If you use this method you'll have to re-season the skillet, since the seasoning will get burned off, too.
Don't use soap or a wire scrub brush on seasoned cast iron. It will scrape off the seasoning, removing the nonstick surface allowing moisture to react with the metal and create rust.
 After you rinse out the food, dry the skillet completely. Use a dry dishcloth to wipe it off, taking care not to miss any crevices and make sure the back gets dried off, too.


You can place the pan upside down over the burner that you used to cook on, if the burner is still a little warm. This will help the pan dry faster.
To make extra sure the pan is dry, heat it up in the oven for a few minutes.
 Every time you cook with a cast iron skillet, the oil you use infuses with the pan and helps keep it seasoned. However, you can help the process along and make sure your skillet stays completely nonstick by using the full seasoning process from time to time, especially if you had to use vinegar and salt to clean it.
 Make sure water from other kitchen supplies doesn't drip onto the pan. If you're storing it with other cookware, line it with a dry dishcloth or paper towel to protect the surface of the cast iron.

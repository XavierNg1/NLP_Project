 It's tempting to fall into impulsive spending when you eat out or shop, especially online. This can be a major leak in your finances and the surest way to fall into a terrible financial abyss. Be aware of your spending impulses and try not to spend unless you absolutely have to.
 When you want to buy something, wait a few days or a week. If after that time, you still want to make that purchase, go ahead and buy it. However, if you find you no longer want or need it, you have avoided an unnecessary expense.
 For 30 days, keep track of how you spend your money. Then consider each expense and decide whether it's absolutely necessary. Remove the unnecessary expenses to significantly cut down on your total spending.
 Shopping for seasonal foods can be significantly cheaper than buying out-of-season fruits and vegetables. Off-brand items at supermarkets are significantly cheaper but of the same quality as their brand-name counterparts.
 Buy only from your list. This way you will buy items you need, rather than indulging in momentary whims. Supermarkets and other stores will try to make you spend impulsively, so sticking to your list can help you avoid this.
 If you say you'll start next month, chances are you'll find a reason to put it off again. The cycle of procrastination can be dangerous, so don't let yourself fall into it at all.

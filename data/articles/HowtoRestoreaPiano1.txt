 Restoring your piano can take a big bite out of your budget, and if you are a novice, you don’t want to engage in especially risky parts of restoration and ruin the piano. Try to get an idea of your piano’s worth and overall condition before you sink money into restoring it. You can contact a local piano tech or other knowledgeable party and they can help you determine the structural and musical condition of your piano, as well as whether or not it will be feasible to restore it. If you have a piano from during or after the great depression, evaluate the materials used to construct it. If main panels are primarily composed of particleboard, it is likely less worth restoring. If it is primarily composed of wood, has a fairly thick iron frame, and is from a reputable brand it is more likely to be worth restoring. Pianos from the competitive market of 1890-1925 are often of higher quality and more comparable to well respected brands today. If you don’t know the age of your piano, you can determine what it is if you know who manufactured the piano and if you have the serial number of the piano.;

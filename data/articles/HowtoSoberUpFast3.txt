 Before you begin drinking is when you should eat foods high in carbs. Once you start drinking, the carbs will help soak up excess alcohol. Dairy products and foods high in natural fats are also great because they coat the lining of your stomach. This helps slow the absorption of alcohol into your system.Examples of things to eat before you drink are pasta, falafel, a burger or sandwich, pizza, milk, ice cream, avocado, or salmon., Try to limit yourself to a set number of drinks. This way you can avoid over drinking. One way to do this is to bring a set amount of cash with you to the bar. This way you can avoid buying too many drinks.You can also practice self-restraint and tell yourself that you will only have three or four drinks throughout the night. Do this by taking 30-minute water breaks in between drinks.
 Try to avoid mixing beer with liquor, especially if you have already consumed beer first. Also try to avoid mixing different liquors together like vodka, rum and whiskey, for example. Instead, keep it consistent with clear or dark liquor, beer, or wine.Additionally, clear liquor, like vodka and gin, is much easier on your body than dark liquor like whiskey and bourbon.
 This is another way to lessen the effects of alcohol. As you drink, snack on foods, or eat a light meal like tacos. Also remember to drink a cup of water in between drinks.For example, after you finish your first two or three drinks, eat a taco and drink a cup of water before you continue to drink.

 Adults suck their thumb for the same reason children do: it feels good and comforts them. For some, it's just a bad habit; for others, it's a mechanism for coping with stress. Try these ideas for figuring out why you suck your thumb.


Keep a journal - Every time you catch yourself sucking your thumb, write it down. Note what's happening and what you are thinking or feeling at that moment.
Look for patterns - At the end of the week, look over the notes in your journal and look for patterns in your thumbsucking. You may find that you always suck your thumb when you feel stressed or bored, when you are watching TV, or when you are falling asleep.
Pay attention - Now that you're aware of your habit and your patterns, pay attention when you're in situations that lead to thumbsucking. Sometimes simply being aware of your habit can help you end it.
 If you find that having something in your mouth is soothing, try something else besides your thumb. Try a lollipop, mints, gum, or a piece of hard candy.
 You can't suck your thumb if you are using your hands. Pick up a hobby like knitting or crocheting. Carry something in your pocket like a worry stone or stress ball, and play with it when you get the urge to suck your thumb.
 Negative reinforcement isn't the best way to end a habit, but it does work for some people. Apply a bitter or bad tasting substance to your thumb. Wear a rubber band around your wrist, and snap it every time you find yourself sucking your thumb. Or, adopt the "swear jar" concept and make yourself literally pay for thumbsucking.
 Some adults suck their thumb because of serious anxiety problems, and they are not able to end their habit until they address its root cause. If you suspect this is the case for you, seek the services of a counselor or other mental health professional.
 Some people find that the taste of nail polish deters them from thumbsucking.

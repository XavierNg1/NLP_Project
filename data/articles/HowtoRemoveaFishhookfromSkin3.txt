 The string-yank is a modification of the retrograde technique and is usually more successful. It also doesn’t normally require the use of a local anesthetic. The first thing that you’ll need to do is find some strong string, twine, or line.Use some fishing line or silk string, for instance. Regular dental floss can work as well.
Tie or loop the line around the shank of the hook and then secure the other end to one of your fingers. There should be at least one foot of line.
Wear eye protection like goggles if at all possible for this method, as the string-yank can cause the hook to fly free. You do not want a flying hook in the eye.
 As in the retrograde method, put light force on the back of the hook to disengage the barb. Gently press down on the shank with your index finger, or any free finger.


Remove your finger from the hook once you think that the barb is free.
 This next step may hurt a bit. The “yank” of the sting-yank method aims to disengage the fishhook from your skin by applying a modest amount of physical force. Pull in the slack on the line and then, with one strong tug, try to pull the hook free from your skin.Yank back at an angle of 30 degrees or so.
Don’t hesitate. Give it a good jerk and, with luck, the hook should exit along the path of entry.

 Time is money, and your object is to get your house renovated and flipped as soon as possible. To that end, create a timeline that lists realistic times for contracting, showing, and selling. You don't have to meet all the goals along the way, but you want to be in the ballpark. A timeline will help you accomplish this.


Note when you expect major renovations to be completed by. Include regular progress reviews to help you stay alert to problems as they arise.
Mark down blocks of time when you're available to work on the house, such as long weekends, vacation time, etc. that you expect to accelerate the work being done.

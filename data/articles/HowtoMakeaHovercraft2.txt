 Cut the plastic sheeting in a circle, about 1’ wider than the main circle. Wrap the excess plastic over the edge of the circle and staple it down using a staple gun, about every 4”.


If you want, use duct tape to tape down the extra plastic and seal any gaps at the edge.
The side covered in plastic is the underside of the hovercraft.
 Turn the board over so that the plastic side is facing up. Take duct tape and use it to completely cover the roughly 1" sq area at the center of the circle. It should be at least a little larger than the small circle you cut out in step 2 of the previous section.


For example, if you just a 6” diameter circle, reinforce a 1” sq. area of plastic.
 Use wood screws to attach the smaller circle to the larger circle, at the exact center on the underside of the hovercraft. These screws should be no longer than the depth of both circles. Use roughly 5 screws to get a tight fit.
 At least 2" from the edge of the smaller circle but still in the reinforced area, cut 6 holes in the plastic. This will let the air escape, creating the cushion on which the hovercraft floats. These holes should be ~1” wide.

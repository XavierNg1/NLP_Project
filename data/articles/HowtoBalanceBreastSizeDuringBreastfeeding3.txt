 When an engorged breast becomes completely blocked, it's called a plugged or clogged duct. Essentially, the milk duct becomes clogged, not allowing as much milk to come through.You will notice a lump in your breast that is painful; usually, this condition isn't accompanied by a fever.Most of the time, your breast will be partially blocked, not fully blocked; however, sometimes, you may have skin cells grow over the end of your nipple, which you'll be able to see as a small white dot., Just as with engorged breasts, it is important to focus more on this side while the breast is plugged. Doing so can help release the clog.Even if your breast is truly blocked, your baby feeding can help. If they don't pull off the small bit of skin cells, you can use a washcloth or even your fingernail to gently remove it., Use a warm compress to help relieve the pain. It can also help release the clog.Doing so right before you feed can make your milk come faster., Massaging can also help plugged ducts. Begin with where you find a sore spot, rubbing in the direction of your nipple. This motion can help ease pain as well as help your milk to flow., Latching is important in getting milk to flow well; therefore, if your baby isn't latching properly, your milk may not be flowing fast enough. In addition, your baby may not be eating enough., If you develop a fever (101°F 38.3°C or higher) or chills, you likely have mastitis instead of just a plugged duct. You may also just feel bad all over, in addition to the symptoms you feel because of the plugged duct. You might also notice your skin turn red on your breast (sometimes in a wedge shape) or a burning sensation, especially while feeding. If you notice these symptoms, definitely call your doctor.Mastitis is essentially an infection in your breast that sometimes develops after a plugged duct.

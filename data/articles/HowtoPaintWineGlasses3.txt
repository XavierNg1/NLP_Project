 Allow the glass to dry for at least 24 hours before proceeding to the next step of heat setting. Stand them upside down on a soft surface such as a folded tea towel to allow them to dry. Try to keep them away from the kitchen or bathrooms, where moisture could affect the drying.


If you're air drying, it may need to be left to its lonesome for up to three weeks. Follow the instructions on the paint's label., If you chose the kind of paint that needs baking to be set, you've reached that time. The process is very straightforward and no, your glass won't melt!


Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil.
Turn your oven to 350ºF (180ºC). There is no preheating required. The idea is to put the glass in a cold oven -- this will gradually increase heat as opposed to placing the glassware in a hot oven, which might cause the glassware to break.
Immediately put the glasses on the lined sheet and place in the oven.
Set a timer for 30 minutes. Turn off the heat after 20 minutes, but leave the glass in for a further 10 minutes. Then, remove the glasses after the 30 minutes is up.

Or, do as as instructed by the manufacturer on the label of the paints you've used (this is done to make the item washable).
 Since some of your glasses might be suitable to give away for birthdays and other occasions, you could fill them up with candy, confetti, or birthday horns, etc. They make for great pieces to be used and taken home.


Consider signing your name or adding the name of the recipient to the bottom of the glass. Add a dab of glue and secure on a bow. A gift too pretty to be wrapped!

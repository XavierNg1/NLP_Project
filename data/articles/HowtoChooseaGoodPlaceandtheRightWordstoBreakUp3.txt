 If you broke up with your girlfriend/boyfriend for someone else, wait a little while before you date someone else. If you break up with your former boyfriend/girlfriend and get a new one in the same day, people will talk, and not in a good way. Wait for a week to pass, then slowly move on the next one.


If you want them out of your life. When you break up with someone, don't just cast them away like a used tissue. Keep them around and slowly let your contact with them diminish. Don't initiate communication with them or they may think you're still interested in them.
If you want to keep them as a friend. After you break up with them, give them some time, like a day or two. Then, initiate communication with them every now and then, that way they'll think that you're still their friend, but that you're not trying to run back to them.
 If you start talking about how bad a relationship was, word of mouth(the rumor mill, snitches) will get around and more drama than you can imagine will come as a result. Don't talk about it unless you really feel as though it's time to talk to someone about it, and even then, let that someone not be a friend of the ex you're talking about,

, Just because you're not boyfriend/girlfriend status anymore doesn't mean you can't be friends. Even though it may seem awkward to have an ex as a friend, as long as you don't bring up your past relationship with them, you can be friends.

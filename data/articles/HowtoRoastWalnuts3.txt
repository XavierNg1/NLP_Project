 Use a pan that is thick and heavy so that it conducts heat evenly. A thin pan may cause the nuts to burn before they are roasted through.
 Put the walnuts in the hot dry pan. Stir them constantly to avoid burning.
 When the nuts are golden brown they are done roasting.
 Take the walnuts off the heat once they are golden brown.

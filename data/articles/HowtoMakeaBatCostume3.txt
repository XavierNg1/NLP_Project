 If you don’t want to wear a mask, consider wearing face paint instead. First, cover your skin in a thin layer of white paint to make you look ghoulish. Next, paint grey circles around your eyes. Use some black paint to outline “fangs” on your lips.Finish the look by painting your lips black.


Wear plastic fangs instead of painting them on for an extra creepy effect.
Add mascara and red lipstick to become a cute or sexy bat.
 Visit your local Halloween supply store or costume shop and buy some interesting bat props. For example, if you’re planning on wearing a dress with your costume, buy some spider webbed black tights. If you don’t want to make a mask but you still want to wear one, buy a scary bat mask.


Many Halloween supply stores are seasonal, opening in August and closing after Halloween., If you’re making the costume for a child, add sparkles to the edge of the bat wings with craft glue. If you want to add bold colorful designs to the bat wings, paint the fabric with colorful fabric paint.If you like to sew, consider sewing black fur to the top of the bat wings for a realistic touch.

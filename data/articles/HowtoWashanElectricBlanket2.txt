 One important factor is the size of your dryer. Some smaller dryers may not be large enough to wash a large electric blanket. The main criteria is the blanket’s ability to tumble freely. If there is not enough room for your blanket to tumble in your dryer, consider air drying your blanket instead., Your user manual will also include specific instructions on drying your blanket. Some models may even require a brief dryer “pre-heating” period, akin to pre-heating your oven. Otherwise, you’ll likely be directed to dry your blanket somewhere between five and ten minutes.Unless directed otherwise, always set your dryer to “low” when drying your electric blanket.
Remove the blanket from the dryer while it’s still damp.
 Depending on your blanket’s manufacturer, it may need to be stretched back to its normal size after washing and/or drying. Since the blanket will still be slightly damp, it will likely be easy to reshape. In order to do so, have someone else help you.Stand across from one another, with both of your arms reaching along opposite edges of the blanket as far as possible. Then simply gently pull apart from one another.
 To allow the blanket to dry the rest of the way, or if you simply wish to entirely air dry your blanket, drape it over a clothesline or shower rod that will be able to bear its weight. Note that it is extremely important to wait until an electric blanket is fully dry before plugging it back in and/or using it again.

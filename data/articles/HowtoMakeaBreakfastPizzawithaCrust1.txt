 Pick the crust that you think is fitting for this breakfast pizza. Hand tossed, thin and crispy, Chicago style, New York style, wheat, gluten free––all are suitable, it's just a question of taste.;
, Yes, that's right––French fries! Use enough for one or two servings and bake them in the oven for five to six minutes at 350ºF/180ºF.
 Get out the bacon, ham and ground sausage. Cut the ham into small bits. Cook the bacon in a skillet/frying pan halfway. Do not allow it to get too crispy. After the bacon is cool, break the pieces into bits. Brown and crumble the ground sausage. It should be cooked rather thoroughly.
 Let them cool a little, along with the meats.



Sprinkle garlic on the crust that you have chosen. This, of course, is optional.
Put the fries down as the base, followed by cheddar cheese. You can cut the fries to bits or leave them whole.
Add all of the meats, then top it off with your choice of mozzarella or provolone cheese. You can also use both!

, After all the ingredients have been placed on the pizza, it's time to put it in the oven. Bake at 450ºF for 7-10 minutes (depending on how crispy you would like it).

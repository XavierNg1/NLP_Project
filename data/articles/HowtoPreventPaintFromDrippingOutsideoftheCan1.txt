 It needs to be a large rubber band that can be stretched vertically around the paint can. It needs to be a rubber band that won't break, so discard any bands with rips or tears.;
, Place the band so that it hovers across the middle of the can. This allows you plenty of space on either side to keeping dipping in the brush to get more paint without bumping the band.


If using various cans at once, consider placing rubber bands on all cans you plan to use beforehand to avoid having to stop mid-painting.
 Dip the brush halfway into the can of paint. Next, run the base of the brush (where most of the paint has gathered) along the rubber band to remove the excess paint. This should be enough to remove drips and leave an even coat of paint on the brush, ready to begin painting.


Paint a piece of paper or an area you can use as a trial. This will let you know if the trick is working properly.
 It'll soon become second nature to run the brush along the band. Replace the band if it gets too clogged up with paint or in the event of it breaking or sagging too much. And be sure to use a new rubber band every time you paint. Using old rubber bands, caked with paint from past projects could mix old paint with the new paint.

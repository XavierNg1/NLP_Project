 Heavy consumption of alcohol is a risk factor in the development of peptic ulcers.If you have been diagnosed with an ulcer, continued consumption of alcohol can contribute to irritation of ulcers and you should avoid it if you have an ulcer. This is especially true for strong alcohol and liquors.Alcohol can also lead gastritis, an inflammation of the stomach, that can severely impact the amount of time it will take for an ulcer to heal., Much like certain foods, caffeine can contribute to an increase in the secretion of stomach acid, which in turn increases the likelihood of your ulcer becoming irritated. Many stimulants have this effect and are best avoided when you have an ulcer. Caffeine is found in a wide variety of drinks such as coffee, tea, energy drinks and soda, so be sure to check the label if you're uncertain.It is thought that even decaffeinated coffee can increase stomach acid production. So it may be best to avoid even decaffeinated coffee., Quit smoking and avoid second-hand smoke. The chemicals in cigarette smoke can weaken the stomach lining, which irritates current ulcers or may even cause new ulcers to develop. Similar to other stimulants, nicotine may contribute to an increase in the production of stomach acid, which can irritate an ulcer. Nicotine can also lead to inflammation which hampers the healing process., Although there is an uncertain correlation between stress and ulcer pain, some ulcer sufferers find that when emotional stress in their life rises, so does the ulcer irritation. A program that reduces stress may have beneficial consequences and help you avoid irritating your ulcer. Try regularly practicing relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation or tai chi.


Some research suggests that a formal stress reduction program with a class might be more effective for those with an ulcer than doing it at home alone.

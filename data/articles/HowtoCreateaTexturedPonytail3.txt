 This would be a good idea even for those who have curly or wavy hair. It will make your hair easier to work with, and help it hold the style better. If you don't have any texturizing spray, you can try a texturizing mousse instead.


If your hair is straight, you will need to heat style it in the next step. Protect your hair from damage by spraying it with a heat protectant spray.
 Start by sectioning your hair off to make it easier to work with. Next, grab a vertical section of hair (rather than a horizontal one), and wrap it around one of the prongs on your flat iron. Close the flat iron and hold it for a few seconds, then gently release your hair.If your hair is already wavy or curly, you can skip this step.
For best results, use a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) flat iron.
 Use the handle of a rattail comb to section off the hair at the top of your head, from temple to temple, forehead to crown. Twist the hair into a loose bun, then secure it with a clip., Try to position the ponytail as high as possible, without getting into the gathered hair from the previous step., Unclip and untwist the hair at the top of your head. Using your fingers or a wide-toothed comb, brush it back towards the ponytail. Wrap another hair tie around your ponytail to secure the new hair you just added to it. This will give your ponytail extra volume., The hair around your forehead and temples tends to be short and fine. Run your fingers gently over your hairline to loosen them and bring them out. This will help give your ponytail a more natural and relaxed look., Try to use a boar bristle brush for this step. Start at the base of the ponytail and work your way down using short, upward strokes.
 Use a lightweight, volumizing hairspray so as not to weigh down the style. Once the hairspray dries, you are ready to go out and rock your new, textured ponytail.

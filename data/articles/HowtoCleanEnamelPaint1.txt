 Dust removal is important for maintaining enamel-painted surfaces, but an annual dusting is all that most walls need. Run the brush attachment on your vacuum over the walls and ceilings to quickly remove dust from the surface.For smaller areas, a hand duster should suffice.
Always dust before you do a deeper clean. For instance, before trying to remove a stain, give the walls a quick dusting.;
, Dirt and smudges will require more than a simple dusting to remove them. Fill a medium-sized bucket with warm water, then add a few drops of mild dish detergent. Use your hand or stirring device to mix them together. Fill a separate bucket up with just warm water.


You could also mix three tablespoons of distilled white vinegar in a gallon of water to create a safe cleaning solution for enamel-painted walls., Dunk a non-abrasive sponge, like a cellulose sponge, into the bucket of cleaning solution. Squeeze it to remove excess solution. You want the sponge to be dampened but not dripping., Divide the surface up into a series of vertical sections and clean them one at a time. Starting from the top and working your way down to the bottom, gently use the sponge to scrub the surface in circular motion. Once the sponge starts looking dirty, dip it back into the solution, wring it out thoroughly, and continue.If the water in the bucket starts to look dirty during the process, dump it out and create a fresh batch of cleaning solution.
 Wet a second sponge with the clean water in your second bucket. Starting at the top and working your way down, use the wet sponge to wipe down the section and rinse away the cleaning solution. Be sure to remove all soap thoroughly, since dirt and grime can stick to soap residue if left on the wall., Thoroughly go over each section with a fresh towel to remove excess moisture from the surface. Work systematically, such as from top to bottom, so that you won't miss any spots.

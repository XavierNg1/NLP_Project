 Flats can be decorative or simple, and work well with both casual and semi-dressy outfits. They also expose the top of your foot, keeping your foot cool without exposing your toes.
 For nice occasions, consider throwing on that pair of kitten heel sandals you put away for the winter. The warming temperatures bring sandals back into fashion.
 For casual days, a sturdy pair of leather walking sandals looks appropriate and keeps your foot feeling cool.
 Choose a simple slip-on or lace style shoe. These are good to have for everyday use and running errands. White, as opposed to black, navy, or darker colors, works especially well for spring.
 While not quite as freeing as the heeled sandal, an open-toe heel also pays homage to the warming weather by exposing a part of your foot you would likely keep hidden during winter.
 You can wear nearly any footwear for light drizzles, but you might want something more water-resistant for downpours.

 Before jumping to conclusions, take a pregnancy test and go to the doctor. Going to the doctor is the best way to find out if you're pregnant or not.
 This is quite important because you never know they might support you. This person should be the first one you tell. Tell others afterwards

, Look online on what will happen if you choose each of these.
 Try to earn or get any type of money to prepare yourself. If you have a part time job, you may have a small advantage on getting money.;
, Just because you're pregnant doesn't mean you have to drop out of school. There are some options available for school such as: home-school, regular public or private school that you already attend, night school, online classes, and lastly there are some schools that allows you to have children in school because they have a daycare there.
 Move with your boyfriend. Staying with one another would be nice, but save enough cash up for a place just in case things don't work out. If those options don't work out, go to a homeless shelter. It's free and it will give you a place to sleep and maybe eat at until you earn enough cash.
 Having a baby shower helps out a lot. Go to secondhand stores. They offer items for great prices. Also have money saved up for other items. Things to buy for your child/children: diapers, bottles, crib, stroller, car seats, baby carriers, high chairs, pacifiers, baby wipes, food, formula, and etc.
 If you don't have the insurance situation covered, you may have to worry about hospital bills.

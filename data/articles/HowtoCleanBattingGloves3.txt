 Before machine washing your batting gloves, be sure to check their care instructions, which you can find on their tags or in their original packaging. Most synthetic gloves are machine washable and this method is recommended by some manufacturers.If you canâ€™t find any information about machine washing your synthetic gloves, you should hand wash them as you would leather gloves just to be safe.
 If your synthetic gloves are machine washable, wash them on a cold setting. Avoid using bleach or fabric softener, and use only a non-bleach detergent.Add an antibacterial denture cleanser tablet to the wash to remove strong odors.
 When your wash cycle is finished, wring out your gloves in a dry towel if you need to remove any excess water. Hang your gloves out of direct sunlight to air dry them.Putting your gloves in a dryer or ironing them will shrink them, so be sure to air dry them only.

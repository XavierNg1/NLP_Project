 If you need an oral radiologist for medical reasons rather than dental reasons, the easiest way to find a radiologist is to ask for a referral from your doctor. Often, your doctor will have a specific radiologist that they work with, sometimes in the same building., Of course, you want to make sure your x-rays are covered by your insurance. When it comes to dental insurance, it will likely only cover a certain amount per year, though sometimes x-rays are included in preventative care. Often, as long as your dentist is in network, you should be fine.With medical insurance, you need to make sure your insurance will approve it and that the radiologist is in network. You can call and ask if you're not sure.

You can also use your insurance's online tool to search for an oral radiologist who's in-network.
 You may need different types of x-rays for different problems. For instance, if your doctor is looking for cancer in the head and jaw, you may need a panoramic dental x-ray.On the other hand, if you just need your teeth checked for decay and rubbing damage, a bitewing may be more appropriate.Check with the radiologist to see if they perform the type of x-ray you need.
 If you're still worried about choosing an oral radiologist, you always have the option to meet with them. Call up their office and ask if you can spend a few minutes meeting with the radiologist so that you'll feel more comfortable when you do need to get x-rays.

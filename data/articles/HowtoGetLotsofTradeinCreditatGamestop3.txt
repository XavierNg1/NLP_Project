 As per their website, Gamestop accepts video games, consoles, accessories, iPods, iPads, and iPhones.


Your items must be in full working condition to get full value, but items not in full working condition may still be eligible for trade.
The newer the game or console, the more credit you’ll receive.
 The most valuable games are those in demand. Anything related to Mario, Pokémon, or Zelda is usually worth decent money, as long as it's a Wii, Wii U, or DS game.


For example, as of July 2014, Pokémon Platinum for the DS is still worth around $16, and New Super Mario Brothers for the Wii is also worth around $18, while less popular games like Wii Play are only worth $0.25.
Don't bother trading games like Wii Sports (Wii Sports Resort is okay, though), Sports Champions, or Skylanders (you can trade it as long as you have the portal and bundled characters) because they sell in GS for $1 or less, and everyone already has them, and they most likely won't take it.
Don't bother with sports games if they are over a year old.
GS won't take everything. They don't take PS1/2 games, original Xbox games, or Gamecube games, but they do still take PSP (as of July 2014) and DS games.
 They just charge a refurbishing fee from $1-$5. That said, don't expect to walk in with two or three broken Wii games and expect to walk out with 3 brand new PS4 releases. Even with 50 percent extra promotions, three broken Mario Wii games will maybe pay for one used PS3 game.

 You know that at 8:00 the kids will go to school, so set an appropriate time to get up and make breakfast. Remember that the adults can get up a bit earlier to make dinner while the kids savour the last few minutes in bed. Set a good time to eat dinner so that the family is not left snacking all night long. Five o clock is nice. Make sure you have a meal whenever anybody is at home––your family will undoubtedly become unhappy if you do not make meals.;
, It makes things easier if the pets can quickly access their food at any time.
 Quit buying silly things like pools and cars for a while. It may help if you have high chairs for the toddlers so that they can stay there at mealtime. You may need dining tables so that the family is not standing around eating each day. Think about what you need.
 A penny saved is a penny earned.  In order to afford new things, you need to save on things you don't need. Save up for that spa instead of spending every last penny on it and then having none left.
 If you know your Mom has to stay home to look after the kids and animals, it would not be wise to get her a job and call a babysitter. Instead, get Dad a job and the teenager a part time job. Or, get the Mom a profession as a babysitter, so she can work from home. Remember you can reverse this and have a stay-at-home dad.
 They won't be happy if you forget to give them a TV or some toys for the kids. You can afford to get the kids ice creams and take the adults to the spa.

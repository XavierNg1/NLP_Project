 You will need every food group to maintain optimal health while swimming and this includes fats and oils. Meals should contain fruit, vegetable, protein and grain. The meals need to be filling without causing you to be overfull.
 Since you are swimming regularly, your metabolism will increase. This increase in metabolism is for the whole day, not just during and after the workout. It is because of this that eating breakfast is very important. You will need the calories to maintain weight and make it through the day without feeling sluggish or “foggy.”


Include a protein, fruit or vegetable, grain and dairy in breakfast. It should be somewhere between 400 and 800 calories.
 In order to hit calorie amount needed and maintain a healthy diet, snacks are vital. Without the snacks your body may become overtired because of lack of fuel.


The snack can be a protein, fruit or vegetable and should include a grain. The grain, fruit and vegetable helps reload the carbohydrates you have burned and protein will sustain energy.
Go light on high fiber snacks. Fiber will cause bloating if consumed to excess and will interrupt a workout. It is best to start light on fiber and see what works best for you. If you don’t notice issues, then you can increase the amount of fiber. Fiber will be found mainly in whole fruits and vegetables.
An after-workout snack should be eaten within an hour and should consist of protein and carbohydrates to help muscles rebuild. You will need 2 to 7 oz. of protein a day while swimming, the more calories you are consuming, the more protein you will need.

 Any fruit will do, like apple, peach, mango, or banana. A bowl of high fiber cereal, a whole grain muffin, bagel, or English muffin, scrambled eggs, yogurt, granola, and cottage cheese are also good choices. If you drink milk, have low fat, fat free, skim or soy milk.
 Refrain from eating foods high in calories and fat. 100-calorie packs are OK, but it's better to eat fruits, carrot or celery sticks. Little healthy snacks during the day gives you needed energy and prevent you from binging. Some good snack ideas are:


roasted almonds
skim mozzarella cheese
a fresh-fruit smoothie






butter free popcorn






low-fat frozen yogurt
any fresh fruit or vegetable
a small salad

a whole wheat pita
low-sodium pretzels
baked chips
A bowl of high fiber cereal

light yogurt
whole wheat crackers
black bean tortilla chips and salsa

dark chocolate (not too much!)
low fat cottage cheese

, Most nutritionists agree six smaller meals per day are better than three meals a day. A good way to get six small meals is to take your three meals and cut them in half.
 This meal can consist of a meat or tofu and several healthy snacks.
 For dinner, you need to have a protein, like meat, fish, or tofu, and two healthy sides like beans, vegetables, or potatoes.

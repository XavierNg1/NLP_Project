 Part of making someone feel beautiful may mean taking the emphasis off her body somewhat. That is, let her know you value who she is on the inside and out. Often, body issues arise because a person has low confidence, so helping her to feel comfortable with who she is can go a long way to helping her feel beautiful.Encourage her interests and hobbies, and show you appreciate the things she does for you. For instance, maybe you can take her out to dinner to show her how much you appreciate who she is and what she does.
 Don't pressure her, but studies show that working out can make you feel better about your body image, even if it doesn't change your body. So ask her to go for a walk with you or take a dip in the pool., Even if you're not talking about your friend or girlfriend, talk positively about other people's bodies. If you're criticizing someone's body in her presence, she may think that you feel the same way about her., That is, skip any type of media that is solely for the purpose of consuming women's bodies. Your friend or girlfriend will definitely feel like she doesn't measure up, especially if she catches you perusing this type of media.

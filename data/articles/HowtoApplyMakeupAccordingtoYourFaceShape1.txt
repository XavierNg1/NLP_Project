 Many of us are unsure about our face shape and end up applying makeup that is unflattering. The most common face shapes are round, square, heart-shaped, and oval., To determine your face shape you will need to make sure all hair is away from your face. If you have bangs, use a headband as well.
 Pay particular attention to the width and length of your face. Take note of the distribution of facial features.


A round face is equally distant between chin and forehead as it is from cheek to cheek.
A heart shaped face has a wider width from temple to temple, tapering down to a narrower chin.
A square shaped face has the same width from jawline to jawline as it does from temple to temple.
An oval shaped face is generally about one and a half times longer from forehead to chin as it is from cheek to cheek.

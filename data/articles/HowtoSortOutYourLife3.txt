 Write down all of your monthly income and expenditures. Create a balance sheet that will compare what you owe to what you make. Use this sheet to determine where you can make adjustments.


Keep track of everything you spend money on, including small purchases like drinks or snacks, to get an accurate picture of where your money is going and how you can best maximize your income.
 You are entitled to a free credit report every year from the three major credit bureaus. You can either order one over the phone, or receive them online at the website run by all three agencies. Use these reports to give yourself a complete picture of your financial needs.
 Once you’ve gotten a good idea on how you’re spending your money, make a realistic plan on how to manage it. Make sure that all your bills and debt payments are accounted for before allowing expenditures into luxuries.

Use budget software to keep everything organized and easily accessible.
 Take a complete tally of what you owe and how old your debts are. Pay special attention to the interest rates on your debts. Pay your highest-interest debt as soon as possible, while making at least the minimum monthly payments on your other debts. This will keep your interest rates from increasing.


Once your highest interest debt is paid off, move on to the next highest.
Use money saved from cutting out unnecessary purchases directly for reducing debt, instead of making more potentially unnecessary purchases.
 While paying the minimum is fine for months that are tight, make an effort to pay more whenever possible. Otherwise, you will end up paying far more in the long run due to minimum monthly payments being barely enough to cover interest.
 Avoid financing deals whenever possible, and try to pay for big purchases entirely at once. This will help you avoid incurring interest on items and keep you from paying well more than the initial price.

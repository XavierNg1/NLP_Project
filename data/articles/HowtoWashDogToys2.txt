You also could allow them to air dry.

Be careful removing toys from the microwave, as they might be hot.

 Although it isn't a good idea to put stuffed animal toys or anything with plastic inside of it in the dishwasher, rope toys are fine.

If you want to use the toy for longer, take good care of it.

 Start off with two horses, with any traits you'd like. They'll be the breeding pair.


Your Sims can have any traits, but the Equestrian trait is recommended.;
, It must be big enough for a stable/barn and house (unless the barn or stable is on an "Additional lot"). Make sure the barn has at least two stalls. If you can't fit two stalls in the barn, try expanding a bit.
 Add any style furniture you want.



If you're in live mode, make sure your horses and Sims can access the barn.
 Your Sim should also socialize with the horses before he/she goes to bed.
 If you want your horses to be trained, try buying some jumps and race poles.


If you can't afford jumps and race poles, go to the Equestrian Center. If possible, you can also find a neighbor with a horse

, If your horse is hungry, tired, needs to pee etc, stop training and satisfy the needs.


If he horse doesn't want to train anymore, let it relax.
If your Sim is on the horse (or caring for the horse), and it needs something, take care of the needs.
 If your horses have high enough relationships , click "Romantic..." then "Try For Foal". Make sure the stalls are in reach.



Make sure the female is pregnant. When the game tells you "Prepare For a Foal!", that means she's pregnant.
 In three Sim days, the foal should be born.
 If it's not, it will get sad.


The foal should sleep with its mommy.

If you want, you can use Auto Aging.
 Then repeat  breeding.

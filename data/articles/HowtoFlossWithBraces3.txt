 Many dentists and orthodontists today recommend a special tool called a water flosser (or "oral irrigator") to help with flossing. Water flossers are available online, in specialty stores, and even at dentist's office for about $50 and up (brands include WaterPik).
 There is an indicator line to show where the water should reach. Be sure to clean the reservoir regularly — you don’t want bacteria to breed.


Add also mouthwash to the water to increase the antibacterial protection and prevent gingivitis.
 This tool shoots a narrow stream of water which can be used to remove particles of food and clean between teeth, though dentists don't usually recommend them in place of flossing. They can be really helpful as a complement to flossing, flushing out some of the food that might be in particularly difficult-to-reach places. As an added benefit, water flossing can be used for gum stimulation, restoring proper health and function to gums that are inflamed or receded.

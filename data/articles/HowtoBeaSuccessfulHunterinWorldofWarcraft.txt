 As a hunter, there are few advantages you will have as a start-up character, so your racial abilities should be something you strongly consider.;
, Take advantage of this time to build XP based on combat. When you go into an area, clean house. This will ensure that not only have you completed your missions, but that you have gained yourself the maximum amount of character buffing before you head toward your next "stage".
 As stated above, you have few advantages at this point in your career, so you need all the bonuses you can get.
 Chose wisely. Skills like First aid are always a bonus as are cooking and fishing and none of them count against your professions. You only have two professions to choose from, so make them count.
 DO NOTHING ELSE. GO THERE RIGHT AWAY!!! Get it done and get a pet to help you hunt and fight. You will notice your odds in a fight greatly improving.
 Soon, you will find them becoming formidable friends to have alongside you. Much like yourself, your pets will require some specialized training.


Talk to your local pet trainers on how to accomplish this task.
As they advance, they will get skill points to apply to their abilities as well, so keep watch.
 Start learning to use these abilities as soon as they are afforded you and you will easily be able to take on enemies upwards of five levels above your own. It's a great way to power level yourself.

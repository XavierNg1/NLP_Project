 The water should be room temperature—not hot or cold. Make sure the glass is full and can hold 12 to 16 ounces of water.


You can choose to drink something other than water. However, you'll be drinking a lot, so if you choose juice or milk, you may become very full.
Avoid carbonated beverages, as they can trigger hiccups.;
, Now hold it. Avoid breathing in or out for as long as you can. People are able to hold their breath for different amount of time. Aim for at least 10 seconds.


Count in your head or watch a clock with a second hand to pass the time.
Make sure you're not accidentally breathing in and out through your nose.
 Without breathing, start to pour the water into your mouth. You should be able to swallow about 10 gulps of water without breathing or hiccuping.


If you spill some water, it's okay. Simply keep drinking without breathing in or out.
 Once you’ve drank the entire cup of water, continue to hold your breath. When you can no longer hold your breath, you can exhale and again breathe normally.


It may take you several seconds to catch your breath. This is perfectly normal.
 Wait 30 seconds to see if another hiccup comes. If it doesn’t, you’ve cured your hiccups! If the cure didn’t work, you can repeat as necessary.


No hiccup cure has been scientifically proven to always work. So don't get discouraged if your hiccups are still there.

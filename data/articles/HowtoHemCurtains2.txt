 Standard curtain panels have a 1½ inch (3.81 centimeters) wide hem on each side. The hem is folded twice, on both sides, so each panel will need to be 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) wider than you want them to be. This will allow you to create a double 1½ inch (3.81 centimeters) wide hem on each side., The easiest way to do this would be to mark off 1½ inch (3.81 centimeters) at the top and bottom of your curtain, and then to fold it. Use sewing pins to hold the hem down.
 Be sure to press the hem with an iron each time. If necessary, use sewing pins to hold the hem in place.
 If your curtain has a lining, cut your lining down to the width of your curtain, then tuck the raw edges into the hem.
 Cut a piece of hem tape slightly shorter than the length of your curtain. Slip it inside the hem. Align the edge of the hem tape with the edge of the folded hem. Iron the hem down.
 Sew as close to the folded edge as you can. Be sure to use a color that matches the curtain color as closely as possible.

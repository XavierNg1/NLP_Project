 This is a good set of numbers to learn. If there are two options listed, there are two correct ways to write that number. Most people stick to one or the other, either using the subtraction method when possible, or writing everything as addition.


1 = I
2 = II
3 = III
4 = IV or IIII
5 = V
6 = VI
7 = VII
8 = VIII
9 = IX or VIIII
10 = X

, Here are the Roman numerals from ten to hundred, counting by tens:


10 = X
20 = XX
30 = XXX
40 = XL or XXXX
50 = L
60 = LX
70 = LXX
80 = LXXX
90 = XC or LXXXX
100 = C

, Here are some more difficult challenges. Try to get them yourself, then highlight the answer to make it visible:


LXXVII = 77

XCIV = 94

DLI = 551

MCMXLIX = 1949


, Next time you watch a movie, look for a date in Roman numerals during the opening film credits. You can break them down into parts to make them easier to read:


MCM = 1900
MCM L = 1950
MCM LXXX V = 1985
MCM XC = 1990
MM = 2000
MM VI = 2006

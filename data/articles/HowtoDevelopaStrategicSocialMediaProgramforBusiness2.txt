 Before engaging social media for business purposes, it is important that the people involved in the social media initiative have a clear understanding of the attributes of the field they will be playing in. Know the landscape before you start constructing. The social media landscape generally consists of the following attributes that should always be in the mind of a social media strategist or planning team:


Community-driven where people not only listen or view ads and news but they participate in this new media.
Conversation is the new content king aside from videos and images. As David Armano said "It's the conversation economy".It's viral where people spread, shared and transmit content readily. That's what makes social media contagious.
Personal spaces are even more pronounced, if you don't have permission, don't enter. Nobody wants to be spammed or get ad-bombed.
Authenticity is what makes social media real and human. Don't bother with high cost production houses; real is soul here.
 At the end of the day, these attributes are what builds relationships among friends. Get acquainted with people who were previously strangers to you. These attributes build a strong fan base for your brands and business. Small businesses and unknown musicians become famous because of them too.

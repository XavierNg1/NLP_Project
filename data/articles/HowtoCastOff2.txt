 The stretchy cast off is a nice way to give your finished edge a little more stretch than the standard cast off method does. Start by knitting the first two stitches together. Slip the working needle behind the one that has all of your stitches on it and then loop the yarn over the needle and pull it through both stitches., You should now have one new stitch on your right needle. Slip this stitch back onto the left needle., To continue the stretchy cast off, repeat the process. Knit two together again and then slip the new stitch back to the other needle again. Keep going until you reach the end of your project.

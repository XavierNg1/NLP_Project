 Enter Build Mode and select the Create Wall Tool. Hold down the Ctrl key, then drag your mouse over the wall you want to delete.If this doesn't work on a Mac, try âŒ˜ Command instead.
This will delete any items attached to the wall.;
, Alternatively, select the sledgehammer tool in Build Mode, on the same section as the hand tool. Click on a wall segment, then drag the tool over the walls you want to destroy.


The hammer should only destroy walls once you select a wall. If you do not select the wall first, it will destroy everything it touches.It can be tricky to select the wall instead of the floor. Make sure you are on the same level as the wall, and try tilting the camera to get a better angle.

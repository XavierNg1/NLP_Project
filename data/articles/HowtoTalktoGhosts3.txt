 If you want to take your communications to the next level, it's possible to visit an experienced medium and undergo a channeling session, in which one of the group (probably the medium) allows themselves to be "inhabited" by the spirit during hypnosis, who then talks to the group.


Depending on the medium you visit, the communication may involve writing, speaking, or other forms of communication.
It's very important that you visit someone experienced in the matters of afterlife communication. Do not try this alone.
 Scrying refers to any basic method of using a substance or an object to communicate with the other world. Most often, this means crystals, candles, smoke, stones, bones, or glass. Like channeling, scrying is most often effective when done with an accomplished and experienced medium who maintains frequent contact with the spiritual realm. It's difficult to know how to "read" smoke, for example, and might be somewhat dangerous to try., Many famous kids' games revolve around the legend of Bloody Mary, in which you shut yourself in the dark bathroom and invite Bloody Mary to appear in the mirror. Staring deep into a mirror and attempting to communicate with the spiritual world after cleansing the area and creating a safe, benevolent space for the spirits to gather can be an intense and mystical experience.
 In may places, especially the American South, legends revolve around the use of cars parked in specific locations in neutral, allowing spirits to "push" the car to let their presence be known. In some such legends, the driver is instructed to go to a particular location at midnight and put baby powder or flour on the bumper of the car, to show the handprints of the dead who pushed it.


If there's such a legend in your area, try it out. Drive to the particular place, bridge, or crossroad and kill your car. Put it in neutral and invite the ghost or the spirit to give you a push. See what happens.

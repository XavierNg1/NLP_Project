 Ironically, being hot means being cool. It’s a likeable quality to have that attracts people to you because of your laid back demeanour. A few cool things to do:


Don’t try so hard. Or at least look like you’re not trying so hard. It gives the impression that you’re so smooth, you can get want you want without even trying.
If you fidget a lot, bite your lip, stumble in your speech or am just generally nervous, try feeling cool. It’s hard to monitor or stop the nervous little ticks our body does when we're nervous so the best way to go about it is from the inside out. Feel cool and your body language will follow.Be a little rebellious. Sometimes a little rule breaking or risk-taking is very cool and makes you appear powerful. But don't do anything illegal!

, There are many ways to be sexy and look sexy. Try:


Wearing red. There have been numerous studies that the colour red is the sexiest colour. Something in our human brains are highly attracted to the colour.
Smiling. Looking happy and approachable is very sexy. So flash does pearly whites!
Making strong eye contact. This is a highly confident move that draws people in. Pair it up with a smile or flirtatious look to amp up the sexiness.
Flirting. It’s a sexy and fun way to communicate with someone you’re interested in. Subtly draw attention to your body or tease your target with flirtatious looks or bold compliments.
 The worst thing you can do is brag about how hot you are. Modesty and being gracious to others are attractive qualities. The most confident people are those who are able to build others up.


Give compliments. If you want to attract someone’s attention, pay them a genuine compliment.
Don’t brag and look down on others. The attention that comes with being hot can easily develop into a large ego. Your friends, family and other people will be turned off by someone who constantly needs to prove they’re hot or thinks too highly of themselves.

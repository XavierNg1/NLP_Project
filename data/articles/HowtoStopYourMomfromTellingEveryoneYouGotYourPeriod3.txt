 Keep your list with you and make sure you get through all of your points.If you or your mom gets sidetracked, look over your list and wait for a pause in the conversation. Then try saying, “Mom, I understand what you are saying. I still have a few more things I’d like to say.”

, Your mom is more likely to respond positively if she doesn’t feel like she’s being blamed or attacked. Talk about how you feel and how her behavior is affecting you.For example, don’t say, “You ruined my birthday party because you told all my friends’ moms I got my period!” Instead try saying, “I felt really embarrassed when I overheard you telling all the moms about my period.”

, Explain to your mom that your period is private. Period. Tell her you are not comfortable with her sharing personal information about you without your consent.


Try saying, “Mom, I understand why you might have wanted to tell my friends’ moms I got my period. But my period is my business and I am not comfortable with you telling others personal things about me.”
You could also say, “Mom, can you please ask me if it’s okay before sharing my private business with others?”

, No matter what the outcome, let your mom know that you appreciate her listening to you and respecting your privacy.

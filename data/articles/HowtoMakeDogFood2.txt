 You may use ground beef, chicken, lamb, turkey or any other type of meat your dog likes. Cook it by frying, boiling, baking, sauteing or otherwise heating it through.


Add a small amount of organ meat to this recipe every other week, to ensure your dog gets the vitamins she needs.
Olive oil is safe for dogs to eat, so feel free to use it to keep meat from sticking to your pots and pans.
There is no need to season the meat with salt and pepper. Dogs don't have the same taste buds that humans do, and too many spices can upset their stomachs.
 Use white or brown rice (brown rice may be helpful if your dog has digestive problems), oatmeal, barley or cooked pasta. Cook the starch a few minutes longer than you normally would to make it easier for your dog to digest.
 Use fresh or frozen fruit or vegetables, such as green beans, squash, broccoli, spinach, peas, carrots, bananas, or berries. Boil them until they're completely soft, then transfer them to a blender and puree until smooth.


Dogs have trouble digesting vegetables, so it's important to make sure they're completely smooth before serving them to your dog.
If you don't have the time or inclination to puree vegetables and fruits, you can substitute baby food or frozen pureed food. Just make sure it's sugar free.
 Dogs need a lot of calcium to build healthy bones, so its important to add it to their daily diet. Prepare 1/2 teaspoon crushed eggshells or one teaspoon bone meal, which is available at pet stores.
 Place the meat, starch, pureed vegetables, and calcium supplement in a large mixing bowl. Stir the mixture thoroughly, then divide the dog food into serving-sized portions. Place the portions you don't serve right away in airtight food storage containers and refrigerate them until serving time.

 Everyone in your house, not just your overweight child, will benefit from increased physical activity.


Try to go for walks after dinner or on weekend afternoons.
Look up local hiking trails or bike paths and plan a family outing to them.
Sign up the family for a charity fun run.
 They will be more inclined to be physically active if it is an activity they enjoy.


Some activities to try include dance classes, gymnastics, or yoga
Swimming, diving, and martial arts may be other activities your child has not previously considered.
Many gyms let you sign up for a free class before making a commitment for a whole session.
Encourage them to ask a friend to join them. Odds are, theyâ€™ll stick with a class or activity if a friend is there to support them.
 The best way to reinforce an active lifestyle is to live one yourself. Your children look up to you, and if you happily exercise regularly, they will be inclined to do so as well.Think of ways to incorporate more activity into your own life, such as taking the stairs or parking further back in parking lots.
Try a new exercise class. If your child sees you enjoying being active, they will be more likely to see exercise as fun, rather than a chore or punishment.
Eat healthy foods yourself to model good eating habits for your child.
 Kids should only have one or two hours of screen time each day, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.Some devices, such as Kindle Fire and iPads have options that allow you to set a limit, so the device will automatically shut off when your child reaches their screen time limit for the day.


Screen time includes watching TV, playing video games, or surfing on a tablet.
When screen time decreases, active time naturally increases.

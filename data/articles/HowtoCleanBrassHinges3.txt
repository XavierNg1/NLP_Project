 Abrasive scrubbers made of steel wool or brushes with metal bristles will scratch your brass hinges. Instead, always clean your brass hinges with a clean, soft towel or dish cloth., A thin layer of oil can prevent brass from tarnishing. Dab a clean cloth with a bit of linseed, olive, lemon, or mineral oil. Wipe the brass hinge lightly but thoroughly with the oil of your choice., Touching the brass hinges can leave behind fingerprints, and the oils in your hands will hasten tarnishing. To keep your brass hinges looking new, adopt a “hands-off” policy.

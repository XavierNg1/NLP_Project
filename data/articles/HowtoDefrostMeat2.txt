 This method of defrosting is much faster than the refrigerator. Five pounds of meat (2.3 kilograms) or less can be defrosted within an hour, while larger cuts can take 2-3 hours. Additionally, you won’t risk cooking thinner parts of the meat like you would in a microwave. However, once defrosted, the food has to be cooked immediately.
 The re-sealable bag will protect the meat from any bacteria in the air or the water.First, choose a large, freezer-grade re-sealable bag. Next, seal the meat inside, pressing the bag to remove most of the air.


You don’t have to remove any plastic packaging before sealing the meat into the re-sealable bag.
 Choose a large bowl and place it in your sink. Fill the bowl with cold tap water. Next, place the re-sealable bag of meat into the water, submerging it completely. Let the meat sit in the water until it’s completely thaw. Every thirty minutes, dump out the water and refill it to keep the water fresh and cold.


One or two pounds of meat (0.5 kilograms) can take 15-30 minutes.
Larger pieces of meat can take 2-3 hours., Even though the meat has been submerged in cold water, it has been exposed to warmer temperatures. Therefore, the meat must be cooked immediately after defrosting. If you want to refreeze the food, you must cook it first.

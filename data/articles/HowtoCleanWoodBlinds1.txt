 Avoid using rough material to clean your blinds because you can accidentally scratch them. A microfiber cloth or light feather duster are the best tools to use to quickly remove dust from your blinds.Microfiber cloth attach themselves to small dirt fibers on your blinds and will pick up particles that a normal rag would miss.You can pick up dusters and microfiber rags online or at a hardware store.;
, Your blinds come with an adjusting rod or rotating drum that makes them open and close. Rotate this to close your blinds completely so that you can target one side of your blinds.If you keep your blinds open it will be harder to clean both sides of the wooden slats.
 Using your feather duster or microfiber cloth, begin to wipe each slat on your wooden blinds from left to right. Make sure that you focus on each slat individually so you can get the best clean.If you have vertical wooden blinds, then dust from top to bottom.
 Rotate the adjusting rod in the opposite direction to open your blinds, so the other side of the slats are facing you. Repeat the process and fully dust the other side of your wooden blinds.


This quick dusting should take under 10 minutes to complete.
Wood blinds should be dusted at least once a month to maintain a clean appearance.

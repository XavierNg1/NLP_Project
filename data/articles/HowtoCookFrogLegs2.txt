 Rinse the frog legs and pat dry with clean paper towels. Divide them at the joint using sharp kitchen scissors.


If you do not have a pair of scissors set aside for kitchen use, you could use a sharp knife, instead.
 Place the crushed crackers, flour, cornmeal, dried minced onion, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Zip the back up and shake vigorously to combine the ingredients together.


Make sure that the bag is large enough to fit the coating ingredients as well as one or two frog leg pieces at a time.
 Whisk the eggs and milk together in a small bowl until thoroughly mixed.


The mixture should be a consistent pale yellow color without any variations or streaks of white or darker yellow.
 Pour the vegetable oil and peanut oil into the skillet and heat them over medium-high heat for a couple of minutes.


The oil should be about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) deep.
Make sure that the skillet you use is heavy and has high sides. If you do not have a large skillet with tall sides, you could use a saucepan, instead.
 Dip each leg in the egg mixture. After letting the excess drip off, dredge each leg in the cracker mixture, turning to coat all sides.


If the bag with the cracker mixture is large enough, you can place a few pieces of frog leg in the bag at once, seal it, and shake lightly to coat them.
 Transfer the frog legs into the hot oil, cooking each one for about 5 minutes per side.


Be careful as you put the legs in the oil. The oil may sputter and spit at you if you get your hand too close or cause it to splash up by dropping the legs in with too much force.
If you notice that the legs are browning too fast, reduce the heat of the stove to medium from medium-high.
 Use tongs to fish the cooked frog legs from the hot oil and transfer them to clean paper towels. Serve once the legs have drained for a minute or so.

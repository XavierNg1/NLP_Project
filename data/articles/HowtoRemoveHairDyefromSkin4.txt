 Dab a small amount of petroleum jelly onto your skin and massage it into the dye stain using a circular motion. Continue rubbing until you notice the stain starting to wear off.


Petroleum jelly is safe to use on your face and hands, but you should still avoid getting it in your eyes.
You can use your fingers to rub the petroleum jelly onto the dye stain, but a cotton ball or cotton pad may work better since the dye may accidentally transfer onto your fingers if you bring them into direct contact with the dye.
If the petroleum jelly soaks into the cotton, though, use your fingers.
 After the dye begins to tint petroleum jelly, use a wet, clean rag to wipe the petroleum jelly off your skin.


If the stain has been lifted, stop here.
If the stain has been lightened by some dye still remains, continue on with the remaining steps.
 Use a cotton pad or your fingers to apply a thin coat of petroleum jelly over the dyed area of skin. Allow the petroleum jelly to sit on the stain overnight.


If you are worried about the dye rubbing off onto your bedsheets in the middle of the night, cover the area with breathable cotton bandages. Alternatively, if the stain is on your hands, you can also cover it with disposable gloves as the petroleum jelly sits.
 Use a clean, wet rag to wipe the petroleum jelly and remaining dye off your skin, scrubbing gently as you wipe it off.


If more dye remains even after this, try another dye removal method.

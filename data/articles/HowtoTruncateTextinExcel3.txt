 This should be a cell that has more characters than space.
 It's in the toolbar at the top of your Excel page.
 You'll find this option in the "Data Tools" section of the Data tab.


This function divides the cell’s contents of one Excel cell into separate columns.
 After clicking on Text to Columns window will pop up, called "Convert Text to Columns Wizard Step 1 of 3." The window will have two selections: "Delimited" and "Fixed Width." Delimited means that characters, such as tabs or commas will divide each field. You will usually select delimited when you’re importing data from another application, such as a database. The fixed width option means that the fields are lined up in columns that have spaces between the individual field.
 This window shows three options. If you want to create a break line, click on the position where you want the text to break. If you want to delete the break line, double click on the line. To adjust the line, click and drag it around the data.
 This window has several options, "General", "Text," "Date" and "Do not import column (skip)." Unless you want to force your cell's formatting to do something different than its natural state, you can skip this page.
 Your text should now be divided between two or more cells.

, If, for example, you’d like to start a new StumbleUpon account under the same address, you will need to dissociate it from your current account in order to be able to start over with a clean slate. To do this, you will need to provide your account with a legitimate replacement email address.


If you don’t have a second address that will serve this purpose, make a new email address with a free email service, associate it with your StumbleUpon account, and then delete it once your StumbleUpon account is terminated.
,, Although deletion is permanent, note that it won’t kick in for 14 days. During this time, you will be able to reactivate your account without losing any information.

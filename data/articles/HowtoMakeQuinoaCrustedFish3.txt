Check periodically until the fish has frozen solid. Once it has, transfer it to sealable freezer bags and put it back in the freezer until it’s time to bake.Once you’re ready to cook, there’s no need to thaw them.

Stir until evenly combined., At the seven-minute mark, remove the tray and turn each piece of fish over for an even bake. Return it to the oven and bake for another six to eight minutes, or until they’ve turned golden.Frozen fish may take a couple extra minutes to cook all the way through.

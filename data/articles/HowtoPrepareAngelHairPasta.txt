Put a large pot of water on the stove to boil and add 1/2 tbsp. (8 ml) of salt to the pot. You'll need about 6 quarts (5.5 L) of water to cook 1 lb. (0.45 kg) of angel hair pasta. Once the water has come to a boil add the angel hair pasta and stir. Begin timing the angel hair pasta once the water boils, and turn the heat down so the water simmers. You want to cook the pasta in simmering water for about 3 minutes or slightly longer if you like a softer pasta. Drain the pasta and either chill it under cold running water or toss it with a sauce and serve it immediately.;

A classic way of preparing angel hair pasta is with garlic and olive oil. For 1 lb. (0.45 kg) of pasta you'll need 3 tbsp. (45 ml) of good quality olive oil. Pour the olive oil into a skillet and crush 2 cloves of garlic. Add the garlic to the olive oil, turn the heat on medium and cook the garlic until just fragrant. Toss the freshly cooked and drained angel hair pasta with the olive oil and garlic mixture, serve and pass the freshly grated Parmesan around the table.










Another classic preparation of angel hair pasta requires nothing more than heating up a jar of your favorite tomato sauce and adding it to the freshly cooked and drained pasta. Add as much or as little of the sauce as you like.










After cooking the angel hair pasta, drain it and rinse it under cold water until it is cool to the touch. Combine the pasta with 3 stalks of celery that have been diced finely, 3 sliced green onions, 1 grated carrot and 1/4 cup (60 ml) of your favorite bottled Italian dressing. Toss to combine all ingredients and refrigerate it until ready to serve.

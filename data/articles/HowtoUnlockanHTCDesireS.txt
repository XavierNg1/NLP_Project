Dial *#06# and the number will be automatically displayed on your phone. You do not need to “call” the number; it will appear as soon as you finish entering the code.

, Before paying for an unlock service, it is worth contacting your carrier and checking if they will unlock your phone for you. Almost all carriers will unlock your phone after your contract has expired, and some may unlock it if you tell them that you will be doing lots of travelling abroad soon.
 There are a large number of websites that will offer to unlock your phone for a fee. This can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or two. Research your options and choose a website that seems reputable and trustworthy.


You will need to provide your IMEI number in order to have your phone unlocked. If your phone was ever reported as stolen, you will most likely not be able to unlock it.
 When you turn your phone on, you will be presented with the message “Enter SIM network unlock”. Enter the code you received from the unlock service.
 Once you enter the unlock code, wait a few moments for your phone to acquire signal. Check that you are receiving service, and that you are in the service area for the new network.

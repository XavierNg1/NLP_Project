 For one bottle of vodka, you'll need around 10 peeps.


If you only want to make a half-bottle, buy a 5-count package instead.






Make sure all of your Peeps are the same color — that way, your vodka will be one bright, beautiful color instead of a muddier mix!;
, You don't need particularly expensive vodka for this to work — a mid-range brand is fine.


A jar with a lid is best. If you don't have one, though, you can simply cover the top with aluminium foil or plastic wrap.
If you don't have a large jar, use a big mixing bowl instead.
Keep the bottle — you'll be using it again later!

, Make sure that they're fully submerged in the liquid.
 You should see the sugar coating start to dissolve fairly quickly; the marshmallow center will take longer, though.
 Put a funnel into the original vodka bottle, and line it with a coffee filter or paper towel. Pour the Peeps-vodka mix into the funnel slowly, so that the vodka will separate from the leftover marshmallow bits.


You might need more than one filter to do this.

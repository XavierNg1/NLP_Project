 Set to invite only. You don't want random people in your game ruining everything. Your lobby should have at least eight people in it. Eighteen people for optimal gameplay.;
, There are two teams- the humans and the zombies. Have a ratio for the teams. For example, you have let's say... 12 people. You don't want to start out with eleven people one zombie. The zombie will never infect anyone. Try 3 or 4 people starting out as zombies and the rest humans. This way it will be more fair for the zombies.
 Zombies MAY ONLY USE THEIR KNIFE. That is the only way to infect humans. NO Throwing Knives, Stun, Flash, Heart-Beat Sensors, guns, Explosives, Killstreaks, Riot Shields. Commando is allowed along with Cold-Blooded, Ninja, Tactical Insertions, Light-Weight, Marathon, and Smoke Grenades. Once a zombie infects a human, the human must go on the other team and join the ranks of the undead.
 Humans may only use shotguns (Except for the AA-12), assault rifles, and smoke grenades. NO NOOBTUBES, THROWING KNIVES, HEARTBEAT SENSOR, ETC. The shotgun attachment is allowed. All the perks are allowed except for One Man Army. O yea and no killstreaks allowed. GIVES HUMANS TOO MUCH OF AN ADVANTAGE. Once knifed you must change team. Too many players cheat this way and it ruins the game. Be honest when playing or you might get booted.

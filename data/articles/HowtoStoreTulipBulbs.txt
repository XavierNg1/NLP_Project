 Wipe the bulbs gently. If you are storing tulip bulbs that were dug up from the ground versus packaged bulbs, gently brush off any dirt, but do not wash the bulbs.;
, Place bulbs in a sunny area until they are completely dry. Make sure the tulip bulbs are completely dry before attempting to store them. Dampness can cause the bulbs to rot.
 Damaged tulip bulbs can usually be saved. After drying the bulbs completely, cover the damaged area(s) lightly with a little bit of sulfur to help prevent any rot from developing.
 Place a layer of bulbs in a paper bag or cardboard box. Cover the first layer of bulbs with newspaper.
 The layers of bulbs should not touch each other. You can add dry sand, vermiculite, or peat moss instead of newspaper in the paper bag or cardboard box to help keep tulip bulbs dry.
 Put the bag or box of tulip bulbs in a cool, dry place until early fall. Do not store the bulbs in a refrigerator because fruits and vegetable emit gases that can kill the tulip bulbs. Closets, garages and basements are cool and dry and are better choices for bulb storage.
 Inspect the bulbs at least once every month. Throw out any that have become soft to the touch.

 The message feature allows you to communicate with your backers one-on-one.This is a very personal touch that your backers will appreciate. Click the “Backer Report” link for the reward tier your backer or backers are in. A list of backers will load. Next to each backer’s name, you will see a mail icon called “Send Message.” If you want to send a message to just one backer, you click this icon to type and send your message.


At the top of the report, you will see a link labeled “Message All.” If you click this link, you can type a message to send to all backers from that reward tier.
If you notice that many of your backers have the same comments or questions, you can address them in an update.;
, An update is a way to contact multiple backers at the same time. Go to the top of your project page and click "post update." Enter in the title and the body of the message you want to send out. You can also upload video, audio, or photo files from your computer using the Media Upload icons at the bottom of your Project Update screen. Preview the update before you publish it.Your backers want to see the details of the project and your process. This keeps them excited about the project they have invested in.
Encourage your backers to share your progress with other people.
You can send updates to your backers only or allow updates to be viewed publicly., If your project has been funded, you can use the Spotlight feature to communicate with your backers.

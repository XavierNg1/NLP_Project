 If your horse is overweight, the first step is to reduce or remove grain from your horse’s diet. A horse that is not very active can often do well on good quality forage alone.If you do want to feed grain to your horse, try to avoid grains containing corn, molasses, or high starch levels, and opt for grains with less than 3.5% fat.
 Just like humans, horses need exercise to stay healthy. There are many ways to exercise your horse. You can allow your horse more time in the pasture and you can also spend time riding them to keep them in shape.Make sure that you warm your horse up well before exercise. This will reduce the chance of injury.
If you don’t have time to ride every day, consider longing your horse on a 20-meter line. This is an easy way to exercise your horse from the ground.
Don’t assume that your horse is getting enough exercise just because he’s turned out. Most horses aren’t “self-exercising” and need to be worked out during the day to burn energy.
Don’t overdo it, though. Remember that an overworked horse is at risk of injury and disease.
 In the spring, the grass is highest in fructans, which are difficult for your horse to digest. Thus, it is important to adjust your horse to this grass slowly whether or not the horse is overweight.If you want your horse to lose weight, however, you should restrict your horse’s access to this grass between 12pm and 6pm. This is when spring grass is highest in sugar and carbohydrates.
 One way to help your horse lose weight is to help them eat slower. If your horse eats slower, it will likely eat less. One way to do this is by double-bagging hay nets. This will make it more difficult for your horse to get the hay, forcing it to eat slower.You can also feed your horse more frequently, but in smaller portions. This will help keep your horse from overeating.
Feeding your horse slower will also keep it occupied. This will help keep the horse from getting bored and developing bad habits.

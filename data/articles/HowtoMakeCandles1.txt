, Use a double boiler to prepare your wax for pouring. It should reach a temperature of 180–190 °F (82–88 °C); you can use a thermometer to get an accurate reading. If you would like, you can add a few drops of essential oil at this time.
 Use a piece of pre-tabbed wick (with the metal bottom) and stick it in your container. Add enough so that the wick sticks out a few inches from the top. Tie the top of the wick to a pencil or pen, and rest it over the top to keep the wick perpendicular to the bottom of the container.
 In order to create a smooth pour of wax with no bubbles, you will need to heat up the container you intend to use for your candle. Put it in the oven at 150 °F (66 °C) for several minutes to warm the material.
 Hold the pencil/wick steady at the top of the container, and slowly pour the melted wax in. Avoid bumping the sides or pouring too quickly so that you don’t create any air bubbles in the wax. Only pour ¾ of the way to your desired candle level.
 Wait several hours until all of the wax has cooled in your container. There will probably be a concave divot in the top of the wax. At this point, pour the rest of your wax the remaining ¼ distance to level out the top of your candle.
 When the wax has completely set, you can untie the wax from the pencil at the top of your container and trim to size. Burn your new candle around your house to add style or light to your décor.

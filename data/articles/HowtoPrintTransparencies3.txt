 Usually, you can print from a file at a copy shop. However, you do need to bring that file with you in some form. You can save the file to a jump drive, for example. Alternatively, some stores will let you print from cloud services.To save to a jump drive, insert the jump drive into a USB port on your computer. Find the drive under "This PC." Go the "File" menu in the document. When you save the file, save it to the jump drive folder.
To save to the cloud, just save it to the folder on your computer for the cloud service you use. Make sure you're connected to the internet so it uploads to the cloud.
 Most copy shops will print a transparency for you for a small fee. Having a copy shop do it can make the process easier. Plus, it saves you from buying a whole box of transparencies if you only need to print a couple., Many places have self-service areas where you can print.However, you may need to talk to someone to print to a transparency, as that is a specialized service, not standard printing. Generally, you pay per page you print.

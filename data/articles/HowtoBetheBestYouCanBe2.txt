 Spreading yourself too thin can lead to trouble, so it is important to decide what is important to you and focus on that. If you have too much stuff, get rid of some of it. If you have too many commitments, get rid of some of them. Unnecessary things cloud your thoughts and make it hard to be the best that you can be.


Declutter your house. Having too much clutter around you has been linked with an inability to focus.Streamline your finances by coming up with a filing system or go paperless.
Limit your commitments outside of work. Choose one or two activities to commit to and do them well.
 Only put things on your “to-do list” that you will actually do. If you have more to do than you can handle, delegate that work to people who offer to help you.For example, if your child’s teacher requests that you direct the school Christmas play but you know that you are especially busy at Christmas time, feel confident saying “no”.
 Keep a journal of your thoughts and feelings to determine how you think and feel throughout the days. After some time read through your journal to find patterns of success and failure.Create a plan to minimize the failures in the future.
 Divide your goals into long-term and short-term goals. Set deadlines for these goals and develop a plan to push you towards achieving them. Consider using a daily planner to allocate the time you need to reach your goals.


Keep in mind that changing your habits takes time, so look for ways to help keep yourself motivated. Try posting motivational messages around for yourself or watch a motivational video on Youtube every day.

 Keep an eye out for the light and dark areas where the natural light hits the face. If there is a shadow on the face, this region will require more shading. The contrast is where the definition of wrinkles lie.
 It is important that you are working on a clean and leveled surface., Keep in mind; faces are always oval in shape.


Note that it is highly recommended that these lines are drawn in lightly


, These lines help to accurately proportion the face.


The vertical line should go straight down the middle, and the horizontal line around half way down.
Note that these lines are not permanent and are only for the purpose to draw in the basic facial features. Erase these lines after.
 Like drawn in the figure, sketch in the eyes, nose, mouth and/or ears as lightly as possible.


The eyes and lips form an almond-like shape as shown.
The nose ends up slightly above the lip.
 Draw in the irises of the eye, eyebrows, and form clearer lines for the lips.
 Wrinkles usually appear around the eyes, forehead, and the mouth. As show in the figure, the lines always go away from the face.
 Additionally, darken any other hair and the irises.


To especially darken the areas, try lightly shading and rubbing with a finger.
 As pictured in the figure, lightly erase above/around the wrinkles, along the nose, and the high points of the cheekbone and forehead.


This contrast of the light and dark should give the portrait the dimension of wrinkles.
 Add or darken wrinkles to create more contrast, or erase more areas. Keep on doing so until you have reached your desired result.

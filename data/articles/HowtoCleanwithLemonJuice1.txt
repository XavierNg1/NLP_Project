 You’ll be using only the juice so you want to make sure you get the most juice from the lemon as possible. While you could use pre-packaged lemon juice, for best results use real lemon.;
, If you don’t own a juicer, you could simply squeeze the juice through a strainer into a glass bowl. Juice lemons immediately before cleaning for freshness.
 For regular cleaning (general surfaces), use a clean cloth or dishrag.
 For some jobs, a cloth may not do the job, so have soft and hard bristled scrub brushes on hand.
 You may want to mix the lemon with baking soda, hot water, salt and cream of tartar.

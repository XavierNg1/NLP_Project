 Doing so will allow you to monitor when the fits begin and how long they last. The timing and duration of cries can help you determine whether or not your baby suffers from colic.
 Typically, colicky babies start having fits within the first 3 weeks of life. Even at its latest, colic usually starts within the first 5 months. Additionally, if your baby has been suffering from these bouts of crying for three weeks or more, there is a good chance that he or she may suffer from colic.
 Most colicky babies have fits that last three hours or more.
 In order to be diagnosed with colic, a baby must have uncontrollable crying fits at least 3 days a week.
 Most colicky babies experience fits during the same time each day. Often, this occurs in the late afternoon or early evening.
 Most colicky babies do not have symptoms that last longer than three months. If your baby's cries have far exceeded that timeline, you should consult your pediatrician about other diagnoses.

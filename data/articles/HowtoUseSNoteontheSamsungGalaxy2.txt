 Tap on the S Note icon in the home screen of your Samsung Galaxy tablet or smartphone to launch it. Tap on the plus (+) icon located in the top right corner of the screen that appears, and a list of templates will be displayed. Tap on the template labelled as “Memo” to open a blank new note.


You can also later select any other templates that suit your purpose. Memo note has fewer formatting options and is suited for professional use. Other templates such as “Idea note” have more formatting features. Notes such as “Magazine,” “Diary,” and “Birthday” are also available with suitable layouts and tools that match their purposes—designing a magazine, writing a diary, or creating a birthday card, respectively.
 This is right next to the paintbrush icon, and is represented by the letter “T.” The keyboard will appear.
 You must use the Samsung Keyboard in order to access the black screen for the S Pen.


Swipe down on the screen to open the Notifications panel.
Tap on the “Choose Input Method” and then select “Samsung Keyboard.” After selecting this option, you will be taken back to the note screen.
 The keyboard that will appear will now be the Samsung keyboard.
 The key is immediately to the left of the spacebar. A black screen will appear in the lower half of the note. You can now write on the black screen using your S Pen, and that text will appear in the note above.


If you make a mistake, you can erase your working by tapping on the eraser icon.
You can return to the Samsung keyboard by tapping the keyboard icon at the top of the black screen.
 A Save dialog box will appear. Enter a name for the note in the textbox, and tap “OK.”


Tap “Close” to exit the note and access the templates screen.

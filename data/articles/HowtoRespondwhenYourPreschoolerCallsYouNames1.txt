 Your child’s name-calling is about their own feelings of anger or powerlessness, not about you. Preschoolers act out because they don’t have the coping skills or empathy to find better solutions to their problems yet.It’s still normal to feel hurt when your child calls you a name, but recognizing the real cause of the behavior can help you handle the situation calmly.;
, Give yourself a minute to calm down before you address your child’s name-calling. Count to ten or leave the room, if you need to. Never discipline your child when you’re angry.If you try to discipline your child while you’re angry, you’ll probably just take your feelings out on them, which can be harmful for both of you.
 Show your child that you’re in control of the situation by keeping your tone and your body language neutral. Avoid raising your voice, even if you’re upset.

 Draw a line going from left to right.;
, Form a lowercase "t" with the first stroke by drawing downwards and just barely slanting to the right.
 This stroke will resemble a very wide "9" on its side. Start on the right side of the second stroke and make a loop towards the left. Come back around the starting point and curve around to the left again.
, Use blank kana practice sheets and go across the sheet.

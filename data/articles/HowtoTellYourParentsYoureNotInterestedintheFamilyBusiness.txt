 Make sure that it's not a busy "business day", or when the accounts are due, or when the taxes need to be paid. Try to get them when they are happy and fairly relaxed. Another option is to pick one parent - the most approachable one. Again, when they are in relaxed mode. This way, picking just one parent can make it easier on you, and also gives them time to digest the news and pass it on to the other parent in their own way.;
, This is important, because you want to come across as if you have given it some thought, which makes you sound quite mature. Writing it down also gives you the opportunity to sort out how you say it, and what plans you have for the future. If your parents can see that you have other ideas for your life that will make you happy (or happier) than the family business, they should be more agreeable. Every parent wants their child to be happy.
 Don't cry or whine or have a tantrum. Don't let them blackmail you. Make it clear that this is the path you have chosen and explain why it would make you happier. Even if they say something drastic like "If you don't go into this business, then don't expect anything from me when I die" stay strong. They probably don't mean it, and if they do....then they are quite disappointing as parents and you are better off doing your own thing anyway.

 After all, weddings are meant to be the event of a lifetime! Although you should ultimately rely on the wedding hosts’ definition of the term, it’s safer to air on the side of caution with business casual. This includes dress pants and a polo shirt for men, and a skirt and blouse for women.
 A plain dress shirt is a good choice for men, with a jacket going overtop. For women, a cocktail dress will fit each stage of the casual wedding ceremony.


Graphic fabrics may be worn at casual and semi-casual ceremonies., You don't need to wear a tie in a casual setting. However, it certainly won't be looked down upon, and can add a sense of class to your look regardless of what else you're wearing.
 Although you may put in the extra effort if you want to, you shouldn't go too far with sprucing yourself up. If the hosts are stressing a casual event, you won't want to attract too much attention to yourself by going overboard.
 While being casual means dressing only a bit nicer than you normally would, you should still avoid any sort of clothes that feature brand names or graphic art. Keep your attire simple but elegant.
 If the wedding is meant to be casual, there is such a thing as being overdressed. Do your best to adhere to whatever dress instructions the wedding invitation lays out for you, and it's unlikely you'll run into problems.

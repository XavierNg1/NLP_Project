 Using the bathroom at the same time each day can help to regulate your digestive system and make it easier to poop. Try to choose a time to use the toilet each day, such as right after breakfast, and see if this helps you to have regular bowel movements.Try to go in the morning if you can. Many people find it easier to poop after eating breakfast or having a morning cup of coffee.
 If you are pressed for time and struggle to go when you do have a moment to sit down on the toilet, then try to go only when you feel the urge. You may be able to have a bowel movement quite quickly if you feel like you have to go.

Don’t wait if you have the urge. Get to a toilet as quickly as you can to take advantage of feeling like you have to go.
 If you are feeling like stress is contributing to your constipation, then taking some time to relax each day may help. Try setting aside at least 15 minutes every day to use a relaxation technique, such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation., Having an environment where you can relax can help you poop more easily. Keep your bathroom clean and inviting, such as by getting a nice rug to put at the base of your toilet or by hanging a decorative shower curtain.

To give your bathroom a pleasing scent, try lighting a scented candle when you use the bathroom, using an air freshener, or putting out some potpourri.
 Close the door and make sure your family knows it is not okay to enter if the door is shut. Don't let people pressure you or make a fuss of it.

Try saying something like, “I am going to be in the bathroom for about 30 minutes. While I am in there, please don’t interrupt me.”
If someone knocks while you are using the bathroom, then try saying something like, “I will be out in about 15 minutes. Please do not knock again.”

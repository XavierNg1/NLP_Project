 Keep it genuine and polite. Tell her that she has a beautiful smile, that you like her necklace or that her laughter is infectious. Make her feel special. Be careful not to overwhelm her with larger-than-life compliments, you will just come across as insincere.


Try telling her "You have a great smile, there's something infectious about it!"
Or say "That's a cute dress, red really suits you."

, A good pickup line will make a girl laugh and definitely get her attention. Avoid anything too cheesy or creepy sounding. The key to making a pickup line work is confident delivery, so don't be shy!


For romance, try "Hi, I'm Andrew. I thought we should at least have a conversation before we get married."For quirkiness, try "I can't think of anyone I'd rather survive the Zombie Holocaust with."For flattery, try "My buddies bet me that I wouldn't be able to start a conversation with the most beautiful girl in the bar. Wanna buy some drinks with their money?", You can use non-verbal cues, such as body language or facial expressions, to turn an otherwise non-flirtatious comment into something with romantic undertones.


Keep your body language open and inviting. Maintain good eye contact and smile, smile, smile!
Lightly touch her hand or arm when telling a story, this helps to create intimacy and moves you out of the friend zone.
Avoid negative body language such as crossing your arms, scowling or looking down.

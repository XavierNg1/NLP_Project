 Many people have aluminum foil in their kitchens. Storing celery in it will keep the celery crisp, even for weeks.Simply wrap the celery in the aluminum foil either cut or intact, and do so tightly. You may want to place the celery on a slightly damp paper towel before you wrap it in the foil.Place the wrapped celery in the refrigerator. The foil will enable a hormone called ethylene to get out. It’s a ripening hormone, meaning its release will keep the celery fresh. You can reuse the foil for several bunches of celery.
Plastic bags don’t work as well because the ethylene gas can’t get out, making it more likely the celery will rot. Put the wrapped celery in the typical crisper drawer in your refrigerator.
 If you don’t have aluminum foil handy, you may be able to preserve the celery’s crispness with other wraps.


Cut the end of the celery bunch off so that the celery stalks are all separated. You may want to cut them in half, but it’s not necessary.
Dampen paper towels. The moisture here is important. Wrap the celery in the paper towels. Place the wrapped paper towels into a large plastic zip lock bag. Seal the bag and put it into the refrigerator.Save the top, bottom and leaves of the celery and put them in a ziplock bag that you freeze. You can use them when making stock.
 You’ve cut off the base of the celery, but you don’t have to throw it away. You can use it to grow more celery!


Rinse the base off. Place it into a small bowl of warm water. Position it near a sunny window with the base side down.Every two days, change the water. It will take about a week or 10 days for tiny yellow leaves to shoot up from the base and then turn dark green.
After the leaves have grown about a half inch from the center of the base, transplant it into a planter. Cover it with dirt, leaving the leaves exposed. Water it, and watch it grow!

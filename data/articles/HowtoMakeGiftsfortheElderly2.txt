 Homemade bread is a luxury that many elderly people cannot afford or make. Make several loaves and place the extras in the freezer, so that they can defrost and eat them at a later date.
 If it's hard for an older person to cook or navigate the kitchen, then a casserole is ideal. They can heat it up and eat this comfort food for days.
 If you live nearby the person, promise to make a meal and it eat with them every month. This gesture will taste good and be an uplifting event for their year.
 Many elderly people spent years canning their own jams, jellies, pickles and more. Bring back memories and provide delicious, long-lasting food by giving something that may be sitting in your pantry.

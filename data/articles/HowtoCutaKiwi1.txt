 The fruit should be a brown-green color and have short, fuzzy hairs. Hold it in your palm and give it a light squeeze to feel whether the kiwifruit is soft. If it's too soft, it might have gone bad. Try to pick a medium soft kiwifruit as it will be just right to eat straight away.

, Washing the kiwifruit ensures that any possible contaminants on the skin, such as bacteria, are not transferred to the fruit itself. This way you will not get sick.
 Use a clean, sharp fruit knife and a chopping board. Depending on the ripeness of the fruit, the knife should cut right through. If it's still a little hard, you may need to slice again to cut through the core.









At this point, you can eat the kiwifruit as it is, scooping the flesh out of the skin with a spoon, like you would eat a boiled egg.
Some people prefer to remove the small, black seeds from the kiwifruit, but this is completely optional as the seeds are perfectly edible.
 For smaller, more decorative slices of kiwifruit, cut the entire fruit into circular slices, working from one end to the other, discarding the end pieces. Then cut through the diameter of each circle to form small, kiwifruit semicircles.









These kiwifruit slices make a great addition to a decorative fruit salad and add a splash of tropical color to the tops of cakes, pavlovas and other desserts.
They also make a great bite-sized snack for small children and work well in school lunches. If you want to remove the skin before chopping, just follow the method below.

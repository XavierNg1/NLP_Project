 Once again, take the cushions off the couch.Also, tape off any areas you don't want to get spray paint on, using painter's tape. Tape those areas off thoroughly, as spray paint has a tendency to drift.Glue together any major cracks or use a patch. Sand the area down before painting., Create thin layers of spray paint on the paintable areas. Thin layers are very important when it comes to leather. Hold the spray paint well above the area, moving it around slowly to create an even, light layer. Start in an inconspicuous area to test what it looks like., Spray paint can become tacky and peel if you don't let it dry between layers. Make sure the painted area is completely dry before you add the next layer. You may need as many as twenty layers when painting a couch with spray paint., Once the couch has an appearance you like, stop adding layers. Let it dry completely. Leave it to cure for about at least two days, so you know it's completely dry and cured. Use a soft cloth to rub down the painted area so that you remove any paint that didn't get absorbed.

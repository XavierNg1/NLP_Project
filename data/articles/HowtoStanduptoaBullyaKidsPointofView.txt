 Especially in cyber bullying. If you ignore them, you will feel so much better because it is like an annoying little brother. If you don't reply to what they say, eventually they will stop annoying you.;
, If the bully is at school, in person make sure they don't find out you squealed. Get help, but if the principal tells them off they will just bully you more.
 If they say: "Oh you're so ugly, you don't deserve to live" for example just say "I have looked in the mirror, I know I am not ugly, and if I don't deserve to live, why am I living? God gives everyone a chance," and walk away. Let them know you're not afraid and they will stop picking on you

, If the bullying still doesn't stop, take karate or Tae Kwon-Do if they are physically hurting you, then if you train you will be stronger than them.
 If at any point you are feeling suicidal, depressed, or just terrible, get help immediately. At the end of the day, it isn't about who's popular and who's not. It's about who you are and how pretty you are on the INSIDE, never mind the outside. If the people who are bothering you are teasing you, its probably because they are INSECURE. Just know that you are just styling them and they know that and are afraid!

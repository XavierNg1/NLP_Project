 Make sure to plug it directly into your computer, and not into a USB hub.
 Usually when you plug your USB headphones into your computer, it will automatically switch so that audio plays through the headphones. This doesn't always happen however, and you may have to manually make the switch. If you have a program currently playing audio, it may continue playing on the speakers after you switch to headphones.


Windows - Right-click on the Volume button in your system tray and select "Playback devices". Select your headphones from the list, click Set default and then Apply.
Mac - Hold the ‚å• Opt key and click the Volume button in the Menu bar. Select your headphones from the list of devices.
 This may be caused by a few different issues:


Try plugging the headset into a different USB port. If it works, then the first USB port you tried is likely malfunctioning.
Visit the headset manufacturer's website and download the drivers for the headset. Windows may be having difficulty find the software on its own.

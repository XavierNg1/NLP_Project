 Many flowers will work well for a floating floral arrangement but it's best to choose ones that will hold their shape nicely. For example, camellias, irises and roses work well.
 Cut up as high as possible without endangering the bud and petals., You'll need a bowl or wide raised platter that is elegant and able to hold water. It should have sufficient space to fit the amount of flowers you wish to add. Ideally, the item needs to be shallow without allowing the water to fall out.

Glass bowls are very pretty for floating floral arrangements.
 Keep the amount as low as possible, so as not to swamp the flowers., It is also nice to add a few leaves, especially fragrant leaves such as mint, pine or lemon balm leaves.

If you like, add some essential or scented oil to the water. This is only where the flowers chosen aren't sufficiently scented themselves.
 It's that easy to do, so there's no need for more fuss.

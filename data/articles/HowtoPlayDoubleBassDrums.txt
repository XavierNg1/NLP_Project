 Make sure that you stretch before playing (One recommends doing 3 sets of 25 calf raises 30 seconds prior to playing).;

The heel down technique is simple, yet most drummers find it more difficult than heel up. Put both of your feet on the foot pedals so that they completely cover them. Then, just play a rhythm by following one beat after the other. Do not raise your foot off the pedal, you want your foot to stay in contact with the foot board so you will have better control of the entire motion of each hit. You may feel muscle strain in the front of your calf, that means that you are using the correct muscles, but don't overdo it!






The heel up technique - place your feet onto the pedal the same way as in Heel down technique, but lift your heel off the pedal. The ball of your foot should always stay in contact with the foot board so that you maintain control of the entire movement of each hit. Kick one beat after the other. Make sure that you rest the beater of the pedal on the bass drum between hits so that your muscles have a chance to relax. Instead of feeling muscle strain in your calf, you may feel it in the front of your thigh (quadriceps). Again, don't overdo it!







, Try the reverse: left-right-left-right. Try different patterns and repeat each many times. There is a book called "Stick Control" that has many different pattern suggestions.
 Such as: Single stroke rolls, Double stroke rolls, Paradiddles, Flams, Flamacue, Flamadiddle, and many more.
,,, Use a metronome and start slow (60 or 70 bpm). Then slowly build up. Make sure your timing is 100% accurate.
 It takes much longer than that. Measure your progress every two months or so.

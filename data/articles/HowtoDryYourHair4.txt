 Kinky or textured hair can look great and amazing, but it is also delicate and prone to damage. If you have kinky or textured hair, you'll need to take a few extra steps to protect it from the heat of a blow dryer. Here's what you'll need:


Hairdryer
Wide-toothed comb attachment
Heat protecting spray
Styling foam or mousse
Hair cream or serum
Wide-toothed comb

, Use a wide-toothed comb, and start from the ends of your hair first. Only comb your hair from the roots straight down if your hair is completely tangle-free.
 Use a styling foam or mousse if you plan on having a blowout. If you want to straighten your hair later, use a styling cream or serum; it will give your hair more protection.
 You want it to be almost dry before you start using a hairdryer. If you try to blow dry your hair while it is still wet, you might "cook" your hair, and damage it from the inside out.


Consider braiding your hair and letting it air dry all the way, or partway.
 Kinky, textured hair is delicate, and the high temperatures of a hairdryer can really damage it.
 Aim the nozzle downward, and keep it at least 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) away from your hair. If you keep it too close, you might burn or scorch your hair, even with the heat protecting spray.


Try working in smaller sections.
Aiming the nozzle down the hair shaft will help prevent frizz.
Start blow drying from the back of your head first. This way, you won't have to worry about messing up the front after you finish it.

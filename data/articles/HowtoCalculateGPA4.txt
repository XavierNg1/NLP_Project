 Certain classes have weights which alter the 'strength' of the class. A regular (also called on-level) class is multiplied by 1, or left alone. A PAP (which stands for Pre-Advanced Placements which can also be called Honours) is multiplied by 1.05. An AP (Advanced Placement, also called College or College Level) is multiplied by 1.1.


Let`s say a person N. has 5 classes, and these are his grades; PAP Literature=94, Regular Chemistry=87, AP World Civilizations=98, PAP Pharmaceuticals Training=82 and Track=100 (lf unspecified, assume regular).



PAP Literature had a 94 which gets multiplied by 1.05 for 98.7%AJ (AJ=adjusted). Chemistry and Track are regular classes so they are left at their grades, respectively 87 and 100. PAP Pharmaceuticals Training is 82, multiplied by 1.05 is 86.1%AJ, and AP World Civilizations` 98 gets multiplied by 1.1 for a 107.8%AJ.
 The formula is very simple; (g+g+g...)/#g, when g=grade. Or in words, add the grades and divide by the number of grades added together.


So 98.7+87+100+86.1+107.8=479.58. 479.58/5=95.916. So after rounding, Perso N. has a 95.2 or 96 GPA Percentage. lf the number seems too high or too low, be sure to check your math. lf on a calculator, be sure to use parenthesis or mistakes may occur.

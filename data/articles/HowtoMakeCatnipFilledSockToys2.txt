 The ideal sock is either a child's sock or a small adult's ankle sock.
 When you're satisfied that there is enough in there, also stuff in a filling, such as scrap fabric, toy stuffing, etc. Be sure to choose infill that is safe for the cat.
 Use yarn and tie with a strong knot. There should be a little tuft of sock left hanging out for the mouse's "tail".


If you wish, make the yarn long enough so that this can be a dangling toy. If you leave the toy lying around, keep the yarn short and clipped close to the mouse.
 Use a fabric pen to draw a face on the toe end of the sock. Draw on whiskers and ears as well. Alternatively, glue on felt pieces, using non-toxic glue.

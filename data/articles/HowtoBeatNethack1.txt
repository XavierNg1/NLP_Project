 After the early game, things will get a lot easier. Valkyries are good for beginners, but some people play Barbarians because they start with a ton of HP and strength. Wizards are hard to get past the early game because of their low strength, but become very powerful late game.;
, Neutral is average, Chaotic has almost no restrictions (you can kill shopkeepers without making your god angry at you), but has the weakest artifacts. Lawful has the chance to get Grayswandir (18-31 damage, worst case), but a complex code of conduct.
 Time does not pass if you do not take action, and you can plan your next moves carefully. If you see the need to retreat coming up, you will more likely survive if you plan your escape earlier.
 Go down a dungeon level whenever possible for the first three DLs, then completely clear out the third. If you hear a shopkeeper, find him at all costs. Price identification is a huge chunk of the game, so never miss out.
 Sokoban or not? Gnomish Mines or ordinary dungeons? Should you make an effort to clear out major demons? Convert altars?

, The bag will lighten your load. Bless the bag to make it even lighter.
 Most stupid deaths happen due to boredom, so as soon as you find yourself holding down buttons, save and walk away.

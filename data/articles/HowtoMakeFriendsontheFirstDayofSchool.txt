 People don't usually mean to judge you, but they will do it subconsciously anyway. Make sure you are at least clean for your first day, because fresh breath is really important, too. Chewing gum all the time makes you look like a cow-chewing cud.;
, You may have to tone yourself down a bit before you feel acceptable, but don't erase your personality completely from your look. If you usually were sweats and a t-shirt, try to dress yourself up a little, but if you usually wear dresses, dress it down.
 Possibly, you won't feel like it. In fact, very few people will; but if you do, people will assume you are confident and friendly, and therefore, they will be drawn to you. Smile and you'll be a people-cobweb. Just remember - a real smile comes from the eyes.
 A good way to make contact with someone is to ask them if you can sit in the seat near them. This is especially effective if you are alone.
 If you've got a spare pencil and someone needs one, lend it to them. Ask them questions: "How was your weekend?", "What class have you got next?" and so on, are standard questions that will create at least a small conversation. Respond with a friendly attitude instead of a haughty or bored one.
 You have a better chance of becoming friends if you do.
 Extra curricular activities are a great way to bond with others and make new friends, while playing a sport or developing a skill.
 Don't do anything that you don't feel comfortable with, including taking up smoking, following celebrity culture or wearing the latest fashions. Don't go with peer pressure: dress however you want, but don't expect others to do the same.
 Wear different clothes or do different sports or have an unusual hobby, but don't rub it in everyone's face or they'll just think you're showing-off. Be simple and yourself. If you do make friends, people will like you later on into the friendship for who you are.

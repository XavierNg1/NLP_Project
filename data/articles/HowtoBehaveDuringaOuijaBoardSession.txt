, e.g. How old were you when you died? Are you good or bad? Have your questions in mind even before you break out the board.
 It is best not to use the board alone. Have at least two other people with you who are going to take the activity seriously. Make sure that both you and they know the dangers of messing around with spirits.
 It can be a shock but if you wish to stop, you can always say goodbye.
 If you are nervous before you start, you can say a prayer and/or wear a cross.
 Don't ask stupid questions like "Are you fit?" This can make the spirit angry.


Most people have no clue what the dead can do. Ask sensible questions. Be patient and do not laugh.

 If the board starts beginning to do figure of eights, or going from 9 to 0 or a-z etc., say goodbye and close the board.
 This guide will help to make the experience as safe as it can.

 If you live in a city or the suburbs, plan a trip to a nature preserve, wooded area or large park. Children can learn with all their senses if you discuss the Earth or read a book about the Earth in a place where they can witness proof of the plants and animals that rely on it.


The Earth Day network reported that 90 percent of children's playtime in America is spent indoors. Changing this percentage is likely to make your children more aware of their environment. The more time you devote to discovery in a natural setting, the more likely your children are to take an interest in protecting nature. Consider taking nature walks, visiting an aquarium, flying kites or swimming in an outdoor pool or lake.
 Give your child a camera that they can easily use. After explaining an Earth Day theme, ask them to explore a natural area and take pictures of things that remind them of what you talked about.


When they are finished, make a photo collage online or in a scrapbook. Add to the scrapbook every year around Earth Day.
 Give them a theme chosen from this year's Earth Day celebration and allow them to use their creativity.

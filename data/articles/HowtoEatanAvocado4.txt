 The avocados need to be seeded and peeled, using a method described in this article. The onion, tomato, chiles, and cilantro need to be cut into small pieces and the garlic should be minced or crushed.

If using garlic powder, use about 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) garlic powder instead of the fresh garlic.






If using dried cilantro instead of fresh, use about 4 tsp (20 ml) of the herb.






Remove the seeds from the green chiles as you dice them. If you include the seeds, the dip will be spicier.
 Use a potato masher or fork to mash the avocados coarsely. A few small chunks should still remain.


Do not puree the avocados.






Use the flat side of the fork prongs to mash the avocados.
 Add the remaining ingredients and stir with a large mixing spoon until thoroughly and evenly combined.


You may find it easier to add the garlic, cilantro, lime juice, and seasoned salt first in order to get them thoroughly blended into the mashed avocado before you add the larger, chunkier ingredients. The order you add ingredients does not really matter much, though.
 The dip can be served immediately. Tortilla chips are usually the preferred accompaniment.


To store avocado dip, place a piece of plastic cling wrap directly over the surface of the dip. Use a second piece of plastic wrap to tightly seal the top of the bowl. Store the dip in the refrigerator for a few days to a week.

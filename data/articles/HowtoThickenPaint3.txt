 Many art stores carry house brand paint additives that are designed to be mixed with acrylic paints. Liquitex and Golden are two popular manufactures of painting medium additives. Look for a matte or gel medium that dries clear to maintain the color of your paints.

Mix a small amount of the medium with your paint.
Stir the paint and test the thickness on a small sample paper.
Blow dry the sample and observe the color and thickness of your brush stroke.
Add more medium if you desire a thicker paint.
 Many gel compounds contain additives to mimic sand or stucco. Combine the texture gel with your paint to give the paint a textured feel.You can experiment with adding sand or sawdust in small amounts to add additional texture.
 Work a small amount of modeling paste to add thickness to your paints that will show up in your brushstrokes.

Modeling paste dries white and may alter the colors of your paints.

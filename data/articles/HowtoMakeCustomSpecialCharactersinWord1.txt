 In place of X1, type the letter/number/character that will appear on the bottom in the new symbol, and in place of X2 type the letter/number/character that will appear on the top.


Note the space after EQ and before \o
For any special characters (like the macron, or overline, in the picture) use the Windows character map or Mac Character Palette (see Method Two).
 The only space between the curly braces should be between EQ and \o. Word inputs extra spaces that will have to be deleted manually.



You must either have the entire field code highlighted or be clicked into the field code for this to work.
If there are any problems, just highlight the character (or error message, or blank space, etc.) and press Shift-F9 to display the field code again. Proceed to edit it as needed.

 A file manager app lets you browse and manage your files in your device's storage. Most phones and other mobile devices will have a file manager app that comes pre-installed.


If you don't already have a file manager app, you can download one from Google Play for free.;
, Most file managers will open up to a home screen for you to choose where to look at. Your options could include Pictures, Music, Documents, and Downloads. You can access your WhatsApp folder in either one of your Internal storage or SD card storage folders.
 You will see a list of folders in your mobile storage. Find and tap the WhatsApp folder to see the contents of it.


Most file manager apps will have a search function. If you see a magnifying glass icon on your screen, you can tap on it and search "WhatsApp."

, This is where your chat and profile backups are stored. Tapping and holding will highlight the folder.
 Depending on the file manager app you're using, this option could look like a trash can icon, or a button that says Delete on it.
 All file manager apps will ask you to confirm your decision after you tap the Delete button. This will delete all chat and profile backups on WhatsApp.

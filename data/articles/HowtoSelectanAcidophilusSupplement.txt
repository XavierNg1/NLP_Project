 If you prefer to get acidophilus from a dairy product, there are many on the market. However, a probiotic yogurt or milk may contain other strains of good bacteria in addition to acidophilus. Look at labels carefully and make sure L. acidophilus is listed.;
, These come in chewable form and are good for children and adults who have difficulty swallowing pills. Tablets contain between 1 and 2 billion units of acidophilus and can be taken up to 3 times daily.
 Capsules contain between 1 and 10 billion units of acidophilus bacteria, and can be taken up to 3 times per day with a glass of water. Capsules are the most common form of acidophilus due to their ease of use.


Consider coated capsules in cases of stomach upset. If you have been taking antibiotics for an infection and have gastrointestinal problems such as stomach upset or diarrhea, an enteric coating on the capsules may help to ease the symptoms of stomach upset. Enteric coating allows for the pill to dissolve in the intestine rather than in the stomach, which could cause irritation.
 Powder is preferred by people who do not care for pills, or who choose to take acidophilus with food. Powder can be sprinkled on foods or added to milk or juice. It is recommended that you take 1/4 tsp. (1.23 ml) of acidophilus powder daily, once each morning.
 Like yogurt, acidophilus supplements often contain multiple strains of bacterium in addition to acidophilus. If you wish to take only acidophilus, check labels.
 The product will have a guarantee if it contains at least 1 billion units of L. acidophilus. Without a guarantee, the supplement may still contain strains of good bacteria, but not necessarily acidophilus.

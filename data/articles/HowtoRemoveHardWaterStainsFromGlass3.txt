 One of the best ways to get rid of hard water stains is to intervene at the source of the problem and try to correct the pH balance and mineral levels in your water.


You can try to remove the minerals in the water by attaching a filter to your water system.Water softeners can also be added to counteract hard water.
 Hard water should be removed regularly in order to prevent it from drying into stains.


Dry your shower doors after each use with a lint-free towel or with a squeegee to remove all water residue or streaks.Clean your glass every week or so to stay ahead of build-up.
Act quickly: the longer a stain sits, the harder it will be to remove, and it can even become permanently etched into the glass surface., You can also prevent hard water stains by sealing or protecting your glass surfaces.


For glass tables, be sure to use coasters under drinking glasses. Theyâ€™ll intercept any drips and spills and keep them from leaving ring stains on the table.For shower doors, consider applying a wax-based protective coat once or twice a year. The water will run off the wax-treated glass and leave your door clear and clean.

 Turn on the oven and set it to 350ºF/180ºC.
 Use walnut oil to add additional walnut flavor or pick any neutral oil like grapeseed oil or vegetable oil.


Try using olive oil to add a different flavor.
 Use just enough oil to coat the nuts evenly. Start with one teaspoon of oil and add more as needed.
 Arrange the nuts on the pan in a single layer.
 Put the pan in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Check the walnuts frequently to make sure they don't burn.


Stir the nuts part way through roasting to redistribute them so they cook evenly.
 Take the baking pan out of the oven after 8 to 10 minutes or when the nuts are golden brown.

 You can use an ordinary search engine to find a "wildlife database," "hip hop database," or a similar term. Because the information in these databases can only be accessed by typing in a search term, not following a link, most search engine bots cannot find them, making that information part of the "deep web." The search engine can still lead you to the front page of the website, however, where you can use the search bar to make a more specific query.


Free or partially free examples include Science.gov, or FreeLunch for economic data.;
, The Internet Public Library is no longer up and running. You can still use it but it's not being updated. You can visit searchengineguide.com to locate a specialized search engine for finding databases and information on a specific topic only.
 Libraries, especially ones attached to colleges and universities, often subscribe to a large number of pay-to-use databases, which contain information not found on ordinary search engines. Ask a librarian which databases they have available. You may even be able to access these databases using your library card information, but this depends on the specific library and database owner.
 The Internet Archive project attempts to collect digital information to preserve long-term. Browse its many collections to find archives of websites that have since vanished, difficult to find video and audio clips, and even online copies of early video game systems.

 You’ll want to get a light frame but and great suspension that can help absorb the shocks of bumps and rocks. You’ll want the frame to be in the 18’’ to 19’’ range and a frame that weighs around 7 lbs. The shock absorbers can be complicated. There are different strengths designed for different pressures and can be either air or spring based.
 If you plan on a lot of bumps, you’ll want to make sure that your seat has adequate padding and support. Carbon fiber is a popular material and does not have the same rigidity of a plastic shell. A broad, chair shaped seat is great for mountain bikes because they provide a good base.
 If you are thinking about taking your bike on rough terrain, you’ll want to make sure your tires are wide and have enough tread to not slip. They will also need to be thicker than a road tire so that you don't get a flat. You can readily find reinforced tires that have extra support for off roading. You’ll want a tire that is 29, 27.5 or 26 inches. The tire itself should spell out which size it is. The widths for a mountain bike ranges from 1.8-2.2 inches.

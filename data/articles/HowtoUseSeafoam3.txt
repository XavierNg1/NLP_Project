 You will need to use 2 oz (60 ml) of Seafoam for every 1 gallon (4 L) of petroleum oil.You'll be adding the Seafoam directly to the oil in your vehicle. Since Seafoam is made of petroleum, it is safe to mix into the oil and should not cause any damage to the vehicle.
When used in this manner, Seafoam will re-liquify old fuel and deposits, clearing out the carburetor bowl and jets in the process.
 Switch off the engine, if it is presently running, and allow the engine to completely cool down before continuing.


Adding room temperature Seafoam to burning hot oil can shock the carburetor valve springs and damage your vehicle.
 Remove the cap from the engine oil spout and pour the calculated amount of Seafoam directly into the carburetor throat.


Consider using a funnel to pour in the Seafoam. Doing so is not strictly necessary, but funnels can help reduce the threat of accidental spills.
 Cap the carburetor throat, close the hood of the car, and drive the vehicle as usual for as many as 250 miles (402 km).


You should get the oil changed once you have driven a distance between 100 and 250 miles (160 and 402 km). Seafoam is a potent additive, so the oil filter can struggle and the quality of the oil can degrade after this distance.
After driving the car and changing the oil, the process is complete.

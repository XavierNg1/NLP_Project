 The amount depends on how high you want to go, but choose a material that you can break easily with your hands, like dirt or wooden planks.


Don't use blocks that are affected by gravity, like sand or gravel. If something happens at the bottom of your nerdpole, like a creeper explosion, your whole tower, including you, will fall down.;
,,, You should now stand on that block.
,, Hold shift while walking to the edge of the block. Go as far as you can and check whether the pole is damaged and there aren't any mobs down at the bottom.

In this picture, the pole is broken halfway. Be very careful when going down.






In this picture, there are creepers at the bottom. Try to find an alternative route, kill them with a bow and arrows, wait until they're gone, or go down, run, and hope they don't kill you.
 You will fall down one block.,

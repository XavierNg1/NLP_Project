 The percent increase formula calculates the percent increase in a cost as a percentage of the previous cost. Written out in full, the formula is Percent Increase=(New Cost−Previous Cost)Previous Cost×100{\displaystyle {\text{Percent Increase}}={\frac {({\text{New Cost}}-{\text{Previous Cost}})}{\text{Previous Cost}}}\times 100}. The ×100{\displaystyle \times 100} at the end converts the difference from a decimal to a percentage., Start your calculation by putting your variables into the formula. Then, simplify the part of your equation in parentheses by subtracting the previous cost from the new cost.For example, if you bought a gallon of milk a month ago for $2.50 and, today, it is $3.50, subtract $2.50 from $3.50 to get the dollar amount of the change, or $1.00 in this case.
 Your next step is to divide the result of the last step by the previous price. This essentially converts the different between the new and old costs to a proportion of the previous cost.In the example, this would be $1.00 (the result of the previous step) divided by $2.50 (the previous cost). 

The result is 0.40, which is expressed as a number rather than a dollar amount.
 Multiply the answer by 100 to get the percentage increase. The result will be the percentage that the previous cost has been increased by to arrive at the new cost.In the example, this is 0.40×100{\displaystyle 0.40\times 100}, which is 40 percent. 

So, the cost of a gallon of milk has increased by 40 percent between the previous and new costs.

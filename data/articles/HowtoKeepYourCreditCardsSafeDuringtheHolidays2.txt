 Writing down your credit card number, expiration date, and the lost or stolen contact information can be helpful in the event you need to report your credit card stolen.
 Unlabeled ATMs are more susceptible to tampering, and are far riskier than bank ATMs. In some cases, thieves will install electronic devices on or inside ATMs that will compromise your credit card information.
 For example, keep credit cards in your wallet or purse until it's time to pay, instead of leaving it on the counter where other shoppers can see the credit card number and either write it down, or take a picture of it with their cell phone camera.
 During the holiday season, thieves may pretend to represent a charity to steal your money or credit card information via donations.


Ask the charity representative for literature or contact information, or perform Internet research on the charity before donating money.
 During the holidays, thieves may dig through dumpsters or trash cans to locate receipts and other credit card information; especially those located at public venues, such as shopping malls.

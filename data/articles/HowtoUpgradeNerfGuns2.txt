 A quick upgrade that can help you reload much faster is the creation of a dual magazine. If your Nerf gun uses a clip-style magazine, you can tape two of them together, with one upside down.


When you run out of ammunition, you can just flip it over and keep firing without having to locate a new clip or refill the old one.
 You can make your Nerf gun more accurate and powerful by weighting your foam darts.


You can use fishing weights, BB pellets, or even small rocks to weight your ammunition. Just find some that are the right size to fit snugly inside your darts, apply a small drop of hot glue, and push the weight down the small opening at the end of each dart., If your Nerf gun uses a spring or springs to fire darts, you can increase your range dramatically by putting in more powerful springs.


Take the gun apart and remove the springs. A 20 pound spring in a similar size to the one original to the gun will give you much more firepower, although you may need to reinforce the body of your gun with some PVC pipe, as the additional force can make the body fall apart.For advanced Nerf modifiers, you can further increase your range by replacing the barrel with a brass tube, and by removing the air restrictors that limit how much air can pass through the barrel. Specific details for these tasks will vary depending on your gun, but you can find instructions online for most newer guns.

 An online calculator is a simple way to determine how many weeks along you are. You can do a search for one, or you can use the one found at http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/due-date-calculator.aspx., You'll need some basic information, such as when your last period was. You'll put in the first day of your last monthly period. You'll also need to know generally how long your cycle is. The average cycle is 28 days, but it can vary from person to person.If your cycle is irregular, you won't be able to estimate as easily with this method.
 Once you've put your information in, all you need to do is click "submit." The calculator will provide you with estimations of your conception date, gestational age (how many weeks pregnant you are), and your due date.Keep in mind that these are only estimates. Your due date can change.

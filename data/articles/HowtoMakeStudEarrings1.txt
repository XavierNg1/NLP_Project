 Making stud earrings is easy once you have assembled your materials. Check out your local craft store for earring flatbacks, earring décor pieces, and jewelry glue. Before you get started, you will need:Stud earring flatbacks
Earring décor pieces, such as beads, buttons, pennants, etc.
Jewelry glue (or super glue)
Paper towels
Toothpick;
, Use the toothpick to apply a dot of glue to the stud earring flatback. You don’t need a large amount of glue, just enough to cover the surface of the earring flatback.Superglue also works if you are in a hurry. If using superglue, then you can apply the earring glue directly onto the earring flatback with the tube. Only use a small amount and be careful not to get any on your skin or other surfaces.
Be sure to work over a paper towel to avoid getting glue onto your table and other surfaces.
 Take the piece you want to mount on the earring back and press it onto the glue on the earring flatback. Hold the pieces firmly together for a minute to give them a chance to bond. Then, place the earring on your paper towel to dry the rest of the way.If the earring piece you have added has a flat surface, such as a button or flat pennant, then place the earring face down rather than on its side.
 Leave the earrings alone to dry for a few hours or overnight. It is important to let them dry completely before you wear them.If you used superglue, then your earrings will be ready after just a few minutes. However, you may still want to leave them be for up to an hour to let the glue dry and bond completely.

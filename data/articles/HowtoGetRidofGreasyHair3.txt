 If you constantly twirl your hair or brush a lock back with your fingers, you could be wiping off oils from your skin. Clip or tie your hair back so it doesn't fall in your eyes. Check out this article for ways to keep your hands away from your face.
 Try a bun, braids, and other hairstyle that keep your hair tight and together. Keeping your strands together instead of falling loosely will reduce the visibility of greasy hair.
 If you have a big event coming up, you'll want to wash your hair the same day to make sure it looks as fresh as possible. Time your shampooing cycle so that you haven't washed your hair in a few days before the day of the event. Your hair should stay grease-free for the whole day.
 Long, greasy hair can be high-maintenance. On the other hand, most of the grease tends to accumulate near the roots, so a haircut may not improve matters. Follow your own preferences and experience with your hair when deciding on the right length.

 Allow a lot of room for them to roam around in.;
, You should put enough sand so that a hermit crab could fully cover itself with it.
 Hermit crabs love to hide,so make hiding places. Also do not block the corners of the tank because they love to bury themselves in the sand near the corners because they feel safe.
 Make sure that the bowls are big enough for them to get right in.


Replace their food every day. Hermit crabs like many foods, including rice, grapes, peanut butter, pasta, tortilla chips, apple slices, dead crickets, and pretty much everything. These creatures are not very picky. You can also feed them hermit crab food from the pet store. The pet store food doesn't need to be changed every day but make sure they have nice fresh feeling and looking food to eat.
Replace their water every 2 to 3 days with room temperature bottled spring water. You can also put a sponge in their water bowl, so that they will have something to get a drink out of and climb on.
 But not usually the kinds that you get from the pet store.
 Put it in a bowl of bottled spring water for 15-30 seconds. Then, put it back in it's tank. But this is not mandatory.
 Don't let it roam your desk or table. It is very easy for hermit crabs to fall off, or get hurt. Never let your crab be in direct sunlight because their limbs will start to fall off and they will die.
 Be sure that you need to take care of crabs like any other pet, especially when the cage has defecates in it.

 For this flying bird, you should use rectangular A4 paper. Regular 8.5in by 11in printer paper works well. You can also use notebook paper.
 You want two of the corners of the paper pointing up and down. If your paper has two colors, start the color you want the bird to be facing down toward the table, away from you. You will fold up in a way so that the outside of your bird is the side of paper currently facing down.


Fold the paper in half bringing the bottom corner to meet the top.
You will now have a triangle.
 Then open it back up.


After you fold the paper over, bring the flap back down to the table.
 Fold down the tip of your paper on a horizontal crease.


The tip of your paper should extend below the bottom edge thatâ€™s making the base of the triangle.
Fold the paper in half on a vertical crease. You will already have a crease line to make this fold easy from when you folded your triangle in half.
After you fold the paper in half, rotate the paper counter-clockwise 180-degrees so that it is vertical.
 Fold each flap down but leave enough room in the body of the paper bird to grab it.


You will see a triangular shape in the center of your paper which is the beak. Fold the wings down so that the top edge of the fold is even with the top of the beak.
 Holding the body of the bird, fold the wings up so that each wing sits horizontally.


You want your wings to be flat.
Throw your twirling bird like you would a paper airplane and watch it tumble in circles.

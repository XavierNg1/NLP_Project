 Whether you are using Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn, each platform provides the user with the ability to send a friend request or the option to ‘follow’ the person or company. You can use this as an opportunity to introduce yourself to the staff.


Reposting or replying to a magazines articles or editors will enable you to build a rapport with them and will allow them to become familiar with you.
LinkedIn offers a number of writing-related groups among its many discussion groups; you can use these to build a reputation and then request to add editors who belong to the same group to your LinkedIn network.
 Once you have established a relationship or rapport with the magazine and the editor, send them a direct message pitching them an idea and inquiring whether they would be interested in the story.

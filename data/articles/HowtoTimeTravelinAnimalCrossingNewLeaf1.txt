 When you first boot up Animal Crossing: New Leaf on your DS, Isabelle will be there asking you if you’re ready to begin the game.;
, Instead of choosing “Yes, let’s” to get started as you do normally, choose “I need help first…” to reach another branch of dialogue.


From this dialogue branch, Isabelle can either assist you with setting the time, demolishing your home, or re-creating the town.
 In order to TT, choose “Set the time” from the options. Isabelle will then allow you to choose the date and the time.
 Once you have the time that you desire, start the game, and you will see that the date has changed to reflect your adjustments.


This can be done however many times you wish. You could play a whole Animal Crossing month in one real-life day should you want to do so!

 Draw a large, oblong oval in the middle of your page.;
, They should not be particularly far apart, just enough to distinguish them as different shapes. These are going to be his ears.
 Draw a small oval just below the triangle against the edge of the base. Next draw a small oval at the bottom right of the large oval, and put a small circle just beneath it to the side. Right next to that (still within the largest oval), draw two medium-sized circles at the bottom left side of the oval.
 Draw tiny circles for his eyes, and in between those two circles, draw a short cylinder with an oval-like end. This will serve as his snout.
 Draw the legs with curled, sausage-like ovals that slightly overlap the two medium-sized circles. Behind the body draw oval shapes for the other two legs as well. Sketch a jagged shape between his ears for hair, and for his tail draw a hook shape with a rounded edge and a curved triangle beside it.
 After you do so, erase the sketch lines. Use various types of slopes and lines to differentiate the parts of Spider Pig's anatomy (for example, the snout should be a bit lumpier than the rest of the body, and the hooves should be more curved).
 His skin is a pinkish-beige kind of color, while his hair is a light, dirty blonde color.

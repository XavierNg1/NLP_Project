 Perhaps draw clouds, trees, bushes, and people! Then cut out your drawings, neatly and carefully. In this tutorial, the artist has chosen to draw a snake that is coming up out of the card––it's a good idea to choose an image pose that suggests movement or length, to make the surprise even more exciting when the recipient opens the card.
 Use tape or glue to position the drawings in the right spot. Close the card to check it fits well, then you're done!

A small piece of foil will also work to keep slippery products from spreading across your head.
 Begin at the top of the gum, and work it downward with the toothbrush.









Use long strokes. As the peanut butter and gum are mixed, the gum will be broken down. After a certain point, you may want to switch over to a comb or your fingers to get larger chunks out of your hair.
Use the back of a spoon behind the gum as a hard surface to spread the peanut butter on.

Peanut butter will require generous shampooing to wash out of your hair.

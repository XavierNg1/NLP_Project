 Make sure to get out any knots or tangles. Don't part your hair. This style works better with hair swept to the side.


This style works better with longer hair with no layers. Short layers may not stay in the hair when it's swept to the other side of the head.
 You will be starting to braid over the eye opposite of the shoulder you swept the hair over. Grab about a 1-2 inch section. Split this hair into three distinct sections.


If the hair is over the right shoulder, the braid will begin over the left eye, and vice versa.
 Bring the right section under the middle, then bring the left section under the right. Add hair to the middle, which should now be the right section.








A Dutch braid is like the opposite of a French braid. Instead of adding hair and braiding over, you add hair to the strands and then cross under the braid. This places the braid on top of the hair, instead of under like a French braid.
 As you braid, keep adding hair as you cross the strands. Keep the braid close to the hairline along the side of the face. Add hair into the outside of the braid by pulling in hair from the hair sweeping across the back of the head. Do this until you've added all your hair to the braid.
 Once all the hair has been added, just continue braiding with three strands until you run out of hair. Then secure with a hair tie.

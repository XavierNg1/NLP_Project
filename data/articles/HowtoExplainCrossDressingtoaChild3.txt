 It is easier to broach the subject of cross dressing if you have already developed a close relationship with your child. You can create this kind of relationship by having designated times where you speak freely about your feelings and worries.

For example, you can have frequent “sharing times” where you discuss your daily activities, how you felt about certain things, and what you should do about certain situations. Having an open line of communication will make it easier to explain your cross dressing behavior to your child., Some parents find that presenting their cross dressing behavior in context is a great way to explain cross dressing to their children. An occasion like Halloween, or another costume occasion, is great way to explain cross dressing to your children.After talking about dressing up for Halloween or other special occasions, you can explain to your child that their dad or mom likes to dress up, too. This strategy supports the idea that, rather than a guilty secret, cross dressing is an activity.
 By letting your child know how cross dressing makes you feel, they may have a better understanding of why you do it. Try telling your child what kinds of feelings you have when you cross dress.

You can try saying something like, "I feel happy when I'm able to dress this way." Or, "I'm still the same person, but dressing in this way makes me feel better."

, Try not to let your children discover or stumble upon your cross dressing behavior by accident. Sometimes this is unavoidable, but being open about your behavior from an early age can prevent this from happening.

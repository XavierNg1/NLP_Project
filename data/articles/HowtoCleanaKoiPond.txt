 The best time to clean your koi pond is at the beginning of spring, when the pond has started to thaw from the winter. Try to plan for an annual pond clean at the beginning of spring when the weather starts to warm up, your koi become more active, and the water is not yet full of bacteria and algae.You can do a fall cleaning if you are not able to clean the pond during the spring. In the fall, your pond may become full of fallen leaves and debris as the trees change, so you may think about doing a clean. However, you should try to maintain the koi pond during the spring, summer, and fall so the once a year clean is easier to do., Get the pond ready for draining and washing by using the skimmer net to remove any debris on the pondâ€™s surface.

Make sure you send the water into an area of your yard that has good drainage.

If you have any water features in your pond that are made of non-natural materials, such as plastic items, you can use a toothbrush to scrub and clean them so they are ready to go back into the pond once it is clean., Once you have emptied out the pond, you can take a one hour break and let the sun dry out any newly exposed algae in the pond. This will make it easier for you to get rid of debris and algae once you actually wash out the pond., Take out the water hose with the spray nozzle and blast away at the debris and sludge at the bottom of the pond.

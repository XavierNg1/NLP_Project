 Working remotely requires a certain degree of self-motivation. You wonâ€™t have the same degree of supervision as you do at a brick and mortar office. You will need to exercise discipline in completing your work and staying on task, which can be difficult without the in-person support of a boss and co-workers., Working from home requires good communication skills. You will be using web-based applications, email, and the telephone to communicate with your supervisor, co-workers, and clients. You should have clear writing skills, be able to effectively communicate via email, and be able to express yourself effectively over the phone and internet., Working from home means having the wherewithal to set priorities and focus on finishing the task at hand. This can be more challenging than it is in a traditional office where you have more direct supervision. You will be in charge of setting your hour-by-hour priorities and focusing on getting them done, despite distractions like dirty laundry or hungry kids., It's important to think about exactly where you'll be working in your home. You need a dedicated office space that is clean, free from distractions, and equipped with the proper technology. For example, if your current computer room is also where your ten-year-old practices piano and your husband tosses his dirty laundry, it might not be a suitable space for working from home.

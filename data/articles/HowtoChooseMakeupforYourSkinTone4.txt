 Blush is used to highlight the cheeks and should never look streaky, so choose something subtle within your skin tone range.


Darker-skinned people should choose blush in shades of plums for cool skin tones, or burnt orange-bronze for warm skin tones
If you're olive skinned, browns and copper blushes are for you.
People with medium skin tones should use apricot, coral, or peach blush.
Fair and cool skin types should try shades of pink or rose.
Try beige or tawny if you are fair with a warm skin tone.

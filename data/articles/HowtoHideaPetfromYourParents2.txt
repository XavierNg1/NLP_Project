 Dogs need plenty of time outside. Exercise is important, and they will need to poop and pee. Dogs are very difficult to hide for this reason; do not think that you can just keep the dog inside. Wait until your parents are out of the house to walk them. You can also wake up early before they are awake to take your dog outside. They may see your dog as you bring him in or out of the house, so be careful. Use a backdoor if possible.
 Frequent accidents in the house can be a major hint for your parents, especially if they smell or find the evidence. At first, you will have to walk your dog every two hours. Encourage them to go in the same spot every time. Give them a treat when they have gone.This will encourage them to only go outside.


If the dog leaves a mess in the house, you should be sure to pick it up right away. Use scented disinfectants to mask the smell.
 Noisy dogs will soon alert your parents to their presence. When your dog starts barking, give them a treat, and use a word like “quiet.” The treat will get them to momentarily stop barking. Soon, they should stop barking whenever they hear the command “quiet.”Dogs will bark. They bark to protect their territory, because they afraid or sick, or because they are bored. There is no proven method to stop barking completely, so make sure their room is soundproofed.
 Don’t just toss furry blankets into the laundry hamper. You will have to wash all of your dog’s bedding yourself in the washing machine. Save up dirty blankets and beds until you have a full load.
 It may be tempting to wash the dog in a bathtub, but this can leave a big mess that your parents can find. If you can, take your dog outside for a bath. Use a garden hose, or fill up a tub of water and bring it outside. Comb your dog’s hair before washing, and use dog shampoo.Make sure the dog is dry before you bring him back inside. You should probably try this while your parents are not home.

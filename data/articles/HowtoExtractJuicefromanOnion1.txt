 Use a sharp serrated knife to cut a small slice, no larger than 1/2 inch (1.27 centimeters), from the root end of the onion. Slice through the onion until you reach the skin on the other side, but do not cut through the skin. Grab the partially cut end and pull it down, past the length of the onion, to draw back a portion of the skin. Grab the remaining skin with your thumb and first two fingers and draw it back to remove it.

, Use the same knife to remove another slice, about 1/2 inch (1.27 centimeters), from the other end of the onion. Doing so will make it easier to cut or chop the onion, so this step is especially important if extracting juice using a blender or juicer.









If extracting juice using a grater, you may skip this step. Keeping the opposite end intact may actually make it easier to grate the onion.
 Run the peeled onion under a lukewarm tap to remove any small specks of skin or dirt. Dry it with a clean paper towel.

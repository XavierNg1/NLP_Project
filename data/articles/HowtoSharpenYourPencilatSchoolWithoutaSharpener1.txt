 You may find yourself in a situation where you don't have any back-up writing tools and simply can't ask to to borrow a pencil. If so, you'll need to get creative. If you are able to find a rough surface on which to rub your pencil tip, you should be able to bring it back to a sharp tip. Sandpaper will work exceptionally well for this.









If you are in shop class, then it shouldn't be too hard to find a piece of sandpaper floating around. Of course, you probably don't have this in your desk or bag, but if you are a habitual pencil-breaker, and if your teacher is notorious for not letting students up out of their desks, then keep a small square in your desk.Simply rub your pencil along the rough side of the sandpaper, taking care to rotate your pencil every few strokes, and you should soon see a sharper tip.;
, You're probably more likely to have a nail file on hand. It's a smart idea to carry an emery board with you or keep one in your desk. You'll be able to smooth out both your nails and any dull pencil tips!









The rough grain on the emery board should work well to sand down the wood on your pencil and shave the graphite to a sharper point. Simply drag the edge of your pencil tip down the nail file, taking care to rotate consistently.
If you carry nail clippers, many have a metal nail file attachment that swings out. It may be rough enough for you to use to sharpen your pencil, as well.
 If your pencil breaks and you're without a sharpener (or nail file or sandpaper), take a look around you: Are you sitting next to a brick wall? Are you on pavement or concrete?









These rough surfaces should work well to help you out of your predicament: you should be able to hone your pencil tip by rubbing it firmly on the pavement, against a brick wall, or even on the mortar in between the bricks.

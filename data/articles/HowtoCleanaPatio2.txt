 When the patio is really dirty use undiluted bleach. If the patio is regularly cleaned use brown soap.
 While using chlorine bleach be careful when you are scrubbing near grass or plants, the bleach can kill them. If you are using undiluted bleach pour it on the patio and let it rest for a couple of minutes or hours (depending on how dirty the patio is) and come back and start scrubbing. If you use brown soap, just pour some soap over the patio add water and start scrubbing.

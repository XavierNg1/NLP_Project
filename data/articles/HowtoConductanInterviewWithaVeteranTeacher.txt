 Before even contacting the person you wish to interview, you should do some research on the subject of the interview. This will give you some basic knowledge on the subject.;
, While a phone call might not be appropriate for scheduling an interview with one of your high school teachers, this is often the way to go when interviewing almost anyone else. Tell your interviewee why you wish to interview them, and establish a time and place for the interview. Ask for about an hour, even if you won't need a full hour.
 While you probably won't follow the list exactly, it will give you a basic outline to work with.
 If you show up five minutes late for an interview, your interviewee will not take you seriously.
, Be sure to take notes, even if you choose to use a recorder. Taking notes will show that you are serious. While you have to look down while writing notes, look up often to keep good eye contact.
 Ask short questions which allow the interviewee to answer in their own words.

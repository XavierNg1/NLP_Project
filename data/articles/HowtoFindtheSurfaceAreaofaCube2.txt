 Let's say that the volume of the cube is 125 cm3.
 To find the cube root of the volume, just look for a number that can be cubed to become the volume, or use your calculator. The number won't always be a whole number. In this case, with the number 125 is a perfect cube, and its cube root is 5, because 5 x 5 x 5 = 125. So, "s," or one side of the cube, is 5.
 Now that you know the length of one side of a cube, just plug it into the formula for finding the surface area of a cube: 6 x s2. Since the length of one side is 5 centimeter (2.0 in), just plug it into the formula like this: 6 x (5 cm)2.
 Just do the math. 6 x (5 cm)2 = 6 x 25 cm2 = 150 centimeter (59.1 in) 2.

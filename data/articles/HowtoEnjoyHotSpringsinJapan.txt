,, Do not bring your bath towel in with you. It is usual, however, to bring an onset towel. This is a small, usually white towel similar in size to a hand towel. They are usually available for purchase in the bath house. You may also bring any toiletries you like, though shampoo and soap are usually provided in the shower areas.
 In Japan, it is considered rude and unhygienic to get into the tub before cleaning your body thoroughly. You ought to do it for the sake of everyone who will bathe after you. If you are obviously new to visiting hot springs, fellow bathers may watch you closely to make sure you clean your whole body thoroughly.
 If you have long hair, tie it up now. You should not let your hair touch the bathwater.
 Japanese baths may be hotter than you are accustomed to, so use caution. You may want to start by lowering half your body into the water in order to adjust to the temperature. Many people in Japan say you should not stay in for longer than thirty minutes at a time because it increases your risk of fainting. Many people fold the small white Onset towel and place it on their heads to help keep it cool. If you start to feel faint, get out of the water slowly and take a moment to sit before getting a drink or splashing cool water on your body.
 This is so the sweat on your body doesn't dirty the bathwater.

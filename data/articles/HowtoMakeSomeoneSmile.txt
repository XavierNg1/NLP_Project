Soon you'll both be not just smiling, but cracking up.;
, It doesn't matter how stupid, silly, or corny the joke is. Just the effort of making the joke will make the other person smile, even if he or she knows the joke isn't funny. You can even text the person the joke or leave it on his or her answering machine. Here's a knock-knock joke you can try:


You: "Knock knock."
Your friend: "Who's there?"
You: "Britney Spears."

, Take your friend to a park and carry a nondescript grocery bag, saying that you picked up some stuff for your mom.

You can start just by mentioning some things that are on your mind and then make your way to writing some of that person's best qualities. Bonus points if you actually mail the thing!

, Don't give the person a compliment just for the sake of making him or her smile. Really think about it.

Even better if you can do the favor secretly, without the person knowing what you're doing. Imagine the smile on the person's face when you say, "I already folded all of your laundry!"

, We don't do this nearly enough. Take the time to tell the person that he or she is a great friend, an amazing person, and that he or she has so much going for him or her. Make it meaningful and genuine.

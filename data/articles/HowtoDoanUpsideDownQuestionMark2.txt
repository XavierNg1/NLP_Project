 Before creating your inverted question mark, make sure to click into the right spot on your screen. For example: if you're working on a question in Spanish, position your cursor at the beginning of the sentence and click.
 Look to the lower left hand side of your screen. You'll see a circular icon of a colored window. That's your Start button.
 Once you've clicked on Start, you'll be presented with a few options. Choose Programs, then Accessories, then System Tools and finally Character Map.


A window will open displaying a series of characters and symbols in a grid.
 Look through all of the characters and symbols until you find the inverted question mark.
 Simply click on the symbols of your choice.
 Your character will now appear on your screen. Note that the upside down question mark will appear wherever you previously placed your cursor.


If you need to type the inverted question mark multiple times in one sitting, you might consider copying and pasting the symbol. It's a quicker way once you have the symbol on your page. To do so:
Press "Ctrl" and "V" to paste your copied character onto whatever you want or
Right click (will not work with some programs) and click on "Paste".

 When dogs are left outside, their ears, paws, and faces are especially prone to frostbite.The best way to keep your senior dog warm and healthy during the winter months is to keep them indoors. Older dogs are more sensitive to the cold than younger dogs, so it is a good idea to keep your senior dog inside your home, especially overnight., If your dog does spend a lot of time outside, be sure that they have proper outdoor housing. A good cold-weather doghouse should have a sloped roof, insulation, and possibly even a prefabricated (or expert-installed) heater. Keeping your dog outside should only be considered if they are hearty breed and used to the cold.Be sure to seal any cracks and insure proper insulation.
 Another great way to keep your senior dog warm and healthy is to make sure they have someplace comfortable to lay down, at least three inches off of the cold floor. Use a thick dog bed, or layer it with additional blankets to raise it up., If your senior dog is still chilly, you may want to provide them with a hot water bottle to cuddle with. You can find these at most pharmacies. Simply fill the bottle with warm water, and set it in your dogâ€™s bed.

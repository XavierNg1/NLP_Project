 Add to a large soup pot and simmer over a low heat for 1 hour. Use all of the stock you have left over from your meats or poultry on your table.

To add even more flavour to this recipe, any big or small fish or shell fish stock can be added.;
, Strain off the stock into another large saucepan and add your left over vegetables. Roasted vegetables can be added, but no greens or cabbage at this stage, these will be added later. If you have no leftover vegetables, roast some onions, red peppers, baby carrots, suede, baby turnips and baby sweetcorn in some olive oil or vegetable oil while the stock is simmering., Do this after the turkey bones are taken out of the pot and the stock is strained, getting rid of any meat remnants or particles left over from the meat. If you like your soup a little spicy, turn up the heat by adding 1 whole scotch bonnet pepper. Bring the stock to boil, then turn down to medium heat and leave with the lid half open to cook for a further 30 minutes, To a deep soup bowl, add 50g of the mung bean noodles (dry), fill to the brim with the boiling water, cover and leave for 5 minutes or until they are translucent (hence why they are often called glass noodles). Drain the water and add your soup, turkey meat and vegetables. Add sea salt and crushed black pepper to taste and a hand full of chopped parsley and 1 finely chopped spring onion.

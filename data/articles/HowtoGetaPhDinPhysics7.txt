 Unless your adviser is *really* sadistic, you won't be asked to defend until you're almost sure to pass. You'll have to give a talk on the subject = stick only to the main points in your thesis. Remember to do this like a talk at a conference, not like an exam. Most of the questions won't involve quantitative derivations, especially when it's a topic of current interest in your field. Defending your thesis is the easiest of all these steps - it's more of a celebration of the completion of your thesis than a trial.

 This might help you fend off all static problems in the future. All you have to do is buy a humidifier at your local hardware store and set it up in your house. Static is especially common in the winter when the air is very dry. The static will die down over time with a humidifier. If you don’t want to buy a humidifier, you can also just hang your dress up in your bathroom after you take a shower. The humidity will be higher in there and it will take care of the static.
 But first check the label to see if the dress can be washed. Look for a label in the dress that has washing instructions. It should tell you if you are allowed to machine wash and dry the dress or if it will ruin the fabric. Definitely check this before putting your dress in the wash. If you do decide to put it in the wash, adding baking soda to the washing machine can help reduce static cling. If you are machine drying the dress, put a dryer sheet in with the dress, then take the dress out of the dryer while it's still slightly damp.
 Have the hook hanging on the door frame. If you hang-dry your clothes anyway, like on a clothesline, make sure that it is on a hanger for the last 10 minutes of drying rather than hanging directly on the clothesline. This will prevent it from getting wrinkled and will prevent static build up.
 This sounds silly, but it will really reduce the static that you collect on your body. If there’s no static on you there will be no static on you dress, so walk around barefoot if you know you’re going to have to put your dress on soon. You can also put aluminum foil around the bottoms of your shoes to prevent static build up, but walking around barefoot is probably easier.

 By 'centering' yourself, it's easier to access your aura. Try crossing your legs with your legs pressed against each other, interweaving your fingers in a pleading sort of way, and keep your eyes open. A lot of people want to close their eyes, but keeping them open allows you to focus on one point, like a laser.;
, Breathing deeply causes your brain to focus on what your goal is, leading to a better execution. You may feel a squeezing sensation near your solar plexus, but that's what you're aiming for.
 Setting goals is one of the two most important steps to the whole process.
 If you keep your eyes open too long, they'll dry out and you'll lose focus. Same thing with breathing. If you breathe too little or too much, you'll lose focus or pass out. Or both.

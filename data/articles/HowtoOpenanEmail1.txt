,, Most commonly, a sender and subject title will be displayed indicating who sent the email and what the email is in regards to.
 Your email will open in either all or part of the screen for you to read. If your email covers all the screen, then there will most likely be a “back” button or arrow pointing to the left indicated that it will take you to the previous screen. Clicking this will take you back to your email list (your “inbox”) where you can open another email.


Underneath the “Inbox” button are typically other kinds of folders. So you could click on the folder for “Sent Mail,” for example, and then click on the emails shown to open emails that you have sent to others. A “Drafts” folder refers to emails you have started writing but haven’t sent. Depending on your email provider, you may also have other folders with emails in each.

 Open the folders for all computer games you play and delete any saved games that you no longer need, such as really old save games. If you don't know what files are the save games, skip this step.;
, Any files you haven't used in a long period of time and don't need, delete them. This includes old songs that you don’t listen to anymore and files such as old homework.


Note the date that you last used that file. If it was a long time ago (a few months, for example), there’s probably no point in keeping it. . You can use Windows Explorer by displaying details on the files. The last detail is, by default, the time it was last used.
Move old pictures to an external hard drive or USB stick to get them off of your computer without losing them forever!

, All of the favourites from Internet Explorer are in here. Delete all of these except for the ones you marked yourself.
 If you have two Microsoft word documents that are similar, combine them by transferring all of the information from one to the other and them deleting the old file. Believe it or not, this saves space on your hard drive!

, Right-click on the recycle bin and click "empty recycle bin." This takes those deleted files right off of your computer. Be warned though, there’s no way to get these files back after they’re gone.

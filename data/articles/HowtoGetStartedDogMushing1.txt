 Look online for entry-level dog sledding expeditions where there is no experience or gear required. Courses can range from simple dogsled trips to dog sledding courses, ski camping, and private "drive your own team" dog mushing. Research your options online to customize your ideal trip.For instance, Wintergreen Dogsled Lodge in Minnesota offers a range of packages, including a 5 day intensive dog sledding trip where participants receive a complete training in dog sledding and winter survival skills.;
, A good way to get a feel for dog mushing is to observe it firsthand at an event or race. Consider visiting Alaska, where dog sledding has been the national sport since 1972, for the annual Iditarod race - a dog sledding competition that attracts tourists from across the globe.Outside of the Iditarod, smaller races take place fairly regularly, sometimes on downtown streets during festivals or events.Visit the website for Anchorage, Alaska's largest city, at https://www.anchorage.net/ to keep up to date on what races might happening on different dates.
 An integral part of mushing is getting close to the sled dogs that will be pulling you, and understanding how they live. In addition to dog sled rides or demonstrations, many mushers will offer tours of their sled dog kennels to visitors. For instance, the Happy Trails dog kennels in Alaska "owned by four-time Iditarod Champion Martin Buser" offer the chance to meet 30-60 sled dogs. Visitors do not get sled rides, but instead can observe a short, six dog sled run and have photo ops with the team.

 Clean off any oil on the lenses from previous examinations with lens tissue. Take your glass slide, organism facing up, and clip it on the stage of your light microscope with the stage clips which will hold it into place. If needed, use the stage adjustment knobs to move the slide back and forth to make sure the part of the slide you’re examining is positioned under the objective lens.
 Your objective lens should be set on the lowest power which is 10X. You will not be able to see much here but this step is used to focus your microscope. To move the objective lens, use the nosepiece.
 It may move the stage or the upper part of the microscope. You will turn this knob until your specimen comes into focus. Don’t worry about the lens coming in contact with the slide and breaking it, there is a stop that will prevent that. This should only be used on low-power objective. It shouldn’t be needed when you move to your next objective lens magnification.
 Once you have identified the structure you want to examine closer, you will proceed to higher magnification. On this microorganism, we want to use oil immersion to increase the magnification. The oil will form a continuous lens system that reduces the loss of light. This will cause the resolution to increase.
 To apply the oil, turn the nosepiece so that it’s positioned between 40X and 100X.
 You then gently move to the 100X magnification and the oil will meet the lens. You may then use the fine focus knob again to bring your bacterium into better focus. Also, you can adjust the light by using the light intensity control.
 You should be able to identify the capsules as light blue and the cells will appear as dark purple.

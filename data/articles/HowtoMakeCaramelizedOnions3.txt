 Slice them as thinly as you'd like and make sure to separate the layers so all slices are evenly caramelized.
, Drizzle 2 tablespoons (29.6Â ml) of extra virgin olive oil over the onions and and toss them to coat them evenly with the oil.
 Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the onions and toss them again to evenly distribute them with salt.
 Stir the onions occasionally during the process to help them cook even more evenly. You don't have to be around the whole time to do this, but it can make those onions just a bit tastier. They should be soft and golden brown and will release a lot of liquid. If you're happy with them then, you can eat them or pack them up in a container and store them for later use.
 If you want those onions to be even darker and more jam-like then, keep cooking them with the lid slightly ajar so that additional liquid can evaporate. Check on them until you like their look and taste.
 If you're not going to eat the onions you just cooked right away, then remove them with a slotted spoon and put them inside of a sealed container to preserve freshness and move them into the freezer or refrigerator to preserve them. Before putting them in the refrigerator or freezer, it is recommended that if there's any liquid left move it to a separate container. You can use this tasty liquid for a broth recipe or for another recipe. You can keep them in the fridge for a full week or in the freezer for three months.

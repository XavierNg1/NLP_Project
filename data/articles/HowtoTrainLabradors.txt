 Say the name repeatedly whenever you interact with him. The dog should recognize his name before you start teaching commands.;
,


Teach "no" by stating the dog's name followed by the one-word command. This is what you will say whenever you want the dog to stop doing something.
Say the dog's name followed by "come" when training Labrador Retrievers to heed this important command. Don't chase the dog if he darts away. Respond with a food treat or praise when the dog obeys.
Train Labradors to obey a command to "sit" by putting your hand across the dog's chest and the other hand across the rump. Push back and down until he is sitting.
Get a Labrador Retriever to lie down by first getting him to sit. Take a food treat in your hand, give the "down" command and move your hand toward the ground. If the dog doesn't obey, move your hand even lower. When the dog obeys, say "down" again, give him the treat and praise.
Walk the dog on a leash to teach "heel." You should give the "heel" command and quickly pull back on the leash as soon as the dog tugs on the leash. Calm the dog by making him sit for a moment before resuming the walk.
 Repeat the sessions regularly. Make the lessons fun and stress-free for both you and the dog.
 Outside malls are good locations for this part of training.
 Familiarize the dog with climbing stairs, riding elevators, and walking on different types of floors and ground cover like cement, glossy tiles, metal grates, etc. This should prevent the dog from becoming frightened and immobilized if he faces unfamiliar surfaces during an emergency.

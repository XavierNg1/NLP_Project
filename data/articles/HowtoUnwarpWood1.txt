 Moisten one or two large towels and wrap them around the wood, making sure that the entire warped area is covered.








The towels you use should ideally be large enough to cover the entire wood piece. Choose towels or rags that can withstand the heat of an iron.
When moistening the towels, drench them thoroughly and wring out the excess water. The towels should be damp but not dripping wet.;
, Place the wrapped wood on an ironing board or other flat, hard surface. The raised "bubble" should face up.









The concave or inward curving surface should face down.
The surface you place the wood on must be rigid. It should also be able to withstand the high heat of an iron.
 Turn on a steam iron and switch its temperature setting to the highest point.









Give the iron two to five minutes to heat up.
Note that the iron should be designed to work with steam. A dry iron is not recommended.
 Press the iron down on one end of the covered wood. Gradually slide it all the way over the entire surface, applying even pressure to the warped area.








Hold the iron on each spot for 5 to 10 seconds before sliding it to the next spot.
Each spot should overlap slightly to ensure that the entire wood piece is covered.
Do not leave the iron unattended at any point. An unattended iron can burn the press towel and the wood beneath it.
 Check the progress of the wood. If the problem has been corrected, stop here. If some warping remains, repeat the process until the warp is gone.









Once the wood has un-warped, turn off the iron and unwrap the wood. Allow the wood to dry thoroughly before use.
This process may not work on severely warped pieces. If you do not notice any progress after two or three tries, you may need to try another method.

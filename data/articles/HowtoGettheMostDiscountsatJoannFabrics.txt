 These include coupons and sales.;
, These include:


Mailings. Sign up to receive coupons by USPS. They will be mailed to you periodically.
Email. Sign up and you will be emailed coupons up to several times a week. You can either print these out or have them scanned from your smartphone.
Website. On the Joann.com site, you can access plenty of coupons.
Download the smartphone app. This will allow even more coupons to be available on your smartphone.
See if there is a flyer in the store when you walk in. Many of these flyers have coupons.
 Some coupons will cover just about everything in the store. Others will be limited to a specific category, e.g. fabric, frames, yarn, etc.
 If coupons fail to give you all the discounts you can get, you can get additional discounts through sales.
 Notice if the store issues coupons at certain times of month or year and know what to expect.
 Coupons are generally valid for a range of dates. Sometimes, you will receive multiple coupons at the same time that are valid for different date ranges.
 You will save more if you use the coupon that gives you a higher percentage off for the higher priced product. For example, if you have two coupons that give 50% and 40% off respectively, and you plan to buy two products for $10 and $5 respectively, use the 50% coupon for the $10 product and the 40% coupon for the $5 product. This way, you will save $5 and $2 respectively for a total of $7 off. If these are reversed, you would only save $4 and $2.50 for just $6.50 in savings.
 You spend money on gas when you drive to the store. At $3-4/gallon today, this could negate the savings if you repeatedly drive out of your way to the store.

 Don't make them too narrow, and try to keep the edges fairly straight.;
, Make at least three Möbius strips to try all the experiments in this article.
 What do you think will happen?


If you did it right, you should end up back where you started, but you will see ink on both sides of what was the original sheet of paper, even if you never lifted your pen. A Möbius strip has only one surface.
 You can put a little fold in the paper to get the scissors started. What do you think will happen when you cut all the way along the line?


A Möbius strip cut in half stays in one piece, but it is twice as long and half as wide. How many half-twists does it have in it? What would happen if you cut the strip in half again?







, This time, instead of going down the center, draw about a third of the way across the strip. What do you think will happen?


The line will eventually connect with itself.
 What do you think will happen?


This time, two connected loops form. There is one half-twist in the smaller loop. How many half-twists are in the larger loop?







, Möbius strips have only one edge, too. What do you think will happen?

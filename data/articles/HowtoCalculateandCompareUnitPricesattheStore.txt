 The unit price of a product is basically what the cost of each pound, ounce or gram, square foot or meter, etc., of the product is. In some grocery stores and supermarkets, the unit prices are shown with the total price but this isn't always available, so it's important to know how to work this out for yourself.;
, The math figure is Cost of Item / Quantity = Unit Price. Simple examples are provided below:


18 oz of peanut butter is $2.79
$2.79 divided by 18 = $0.16 per ounce
20 ball point pen package is $3.00
$3.00 divided by 20 = $0.15 per pen.
 For example:


24 oz of vegetable oil from Store A is $2.49, which is $0.10 per ounce
32 oz of vegetable oil from Store B is $2.99, which is $0.09 per ounce
In this example, the better bargain is from Store B. You're paying $0.50 more overall, but you're also paying less per ounce.
 At times when you use coupons in your transactions, the unit prices really change and can affect what you choose from the shelves. Let's use the example from above with a "Save $0.50 off one 24 ounce or larger vegetable oil" coupon, but Store A doubles all coupons up to $0.99.


24 oz of vegetable oil from Store A is $2.49, now $1.49 with doubled coupon
32 oz of vegetable oil from Store B is $2.99, now $2.49 with coupon
Store A's current unit price is $0.06, while Store B's unit price is $0.07.
Because of Store A's doubled coupon price, the unit price changed and is now lower than Store B, thus getting 24 oz of vegetable oil is a better deal than 32 oz.
 You can also calculate with other types of units, for example 4 versus 8 toilet paper rolls or the different amount of loads/ounces of laundry detergent.

 It is important to check with your doctor before embarking on any kind of strength-training program, especially if you have a history of injury or illness. Ask if this kind of exercise will exacerbate damage to joints or muscles, or if it is safe given other medical conditions (e.g., high blood pressure). Once you start lifting weights, see your doctor immediately if you suspect that you are injured., As a general rule, you should choose a weight that causes muscle fatigue at around 6-8 reps. This will depend on many factors including your experience, body mass, and overall strength. Start with a lower weight to test your range and ease up to a heavier weight until you discover the right resistance for you., Having a spotter can dramatically reduce the likelihood of injury while weightlifting by preventing dropping or body strain. Ask a friend or fellow gym-goer to spot you, and offer to do the same for them. Be sure to choose someone that you trust and interact well with, as communication is key between spotters and lifters., After weight lifting, there is generally a recovery period of 24 to 48 hours. If you have aching muscles or sore joints after this time, or experience severe neck pain after weightlifting, contact your doctor. You should seek medical attention immediately if you notice a painful bulge in your abdomen, which could be a hernia.

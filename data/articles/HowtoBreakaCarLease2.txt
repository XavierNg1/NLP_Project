 Most leases include a “payoff” or “buyout” price. Paying this amount will release you from your lease and pass ownership of the car to you.The price of the buyout is normally more than the car is actually worth, and the difference can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Consult the Kelley Blue Book to find out your car’s value before choosing the buyout option.
 If you can cut a deal with a buyer who has the cash on hand, you can reduce your overall loss by selling the car immediately after you buy out the lease. Post your car for sale online at sites such as cars.com or autotrader.com. Alternatively, you can sell your car the old-fashioned way. Put a sign in the window and leave it parked in a place with a lot of traffic.
Look for an individual buyer rather than a dealership. Car dealers will offer the wholesale price because they need to make money on the car too – that typically won't be enough to get you out of your lease. A private individual wants to drive the car himself and may be willing to pay more.
Be honest with potential buyers. Tell them as soon as possible why you are selling the car — especially if you require payment up front.
If you need to get the money from the buyer before completing the lease buyout, the buyer may feel more comfortable paying the money directly to your lease company rather than paying you first and having you finish the transaction.
 Depending on the sales tax laws in your state, you may have to pay taxes when you sell your car. There may be other fees to take into account, such as title transfer fees or registration fees.

 This is a piece of metal mesh that can be purchased at a local hardware store and that will fit directly over your current drain opening. It will trap any extra soap scum, hair, or other debris, keeping it from going down the drain.

, This type of metal screen hangs in the middle of the pipe below your drain opening and is not easily visible from above. To install it you will first need to loosen and remove any current drain covers by either removing their fastener screws or rotating them until they come free. Then, follow the installation directions on the screen package.Most hang-down screens will require that you apply plumber’s putty to their outer rim and then place them inside the pipe with the open end facing upwards.
 Grab a small metal mesh culinary strainer and position it directly on top of the drain. You may need to hold it in place with a bit of plumber’s putty or even your hand, as it may slide around a bit when water hits it. Remove the strainer and clean after each use to prevent hair accumulation., Place a used fabric softener sheet directly over the drain opening. The sheet is porous and will allow the water to flow through while trapping any hair or debris on the surface. Throw the sheet away after your shower.This method only works if your shower drain is covered enough so that the sheet will not get sucked down into the drain itself. If that happens, it can clog up your pipes.

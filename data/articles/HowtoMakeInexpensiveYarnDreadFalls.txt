,, If you chose a thinner material, bunch it before you cut it width-way as the width of the material will get thinner as you wrap the yarn around it.



Tape is a good way to secure the yarn to the table.
 from the top, attach yarn to the material you chose by tying a knot.
 Be sure that it is tight enough that you don't see any gaps and that gaps won't form due to handling the falls over time. When you have wrapped the dread to the bottom, cut the yarn leaving a couple centimeters (about 1 in.) of excess, so you can tie off the loose end.


You can estimate how much yarn you'll need for a strand, but it uses more than you'll think so leave it attached to the bundle until you're done with the strand.
 Bunch the strands in your hand to make sure you have enough before you secure them to an elastic or ribbon.


For dreads the size of a sharpie marker 30 to 40 strands is recommended.
 Some people do this with elastics, the downside of this method is that the elastics can stretch over time. Try cutting out some funky patterned material and using that as your ribbon. Or you could just use actual ribbon.


Once you have sewn all of your dreads into the material of your choice, you're ready to install them.
, Flip your head back up and tie a bow with the ribbon. You should now have your dread falls installed.


If your hair is thicker, try straightening it so that its less poofy and obvious under the falls. Sometimes this gives it lift, and sometimes it just looks weird. If your hair is naturally thin, don't worry about hiding your hair cause the falls will do it.

 Even if your eyelashes are naturally curled, you should go about curling them regularly. Eyelashes are the natural frame of your eyes, and curling them will attract more attention to that part of your face. Curled lashes will also increase the wideness of your eyes. Using an eyelash curler, start at the base of your lashes and hold the curler for three seconds. Don't curl for any longer than that, as you'll risk hurting your lashes., Circle contacts function like regular contacts, but they intentionally cover part of the whites as well increasing the apparent size of your irises. This results in a doe-like appearance comparable with Japanese anime.Although circle contacts are popular predominantly in East Asia, you can order them online. They cost between $20-30 a pair, and can be purchased in prescription brands as well. LensCircle is one place to purchase them.Circle contact lenses have been associated with risks and significant injuries, including blindness. They're also currently unapproved by the FDA. There hasn't been a significant amount of empirical research on the subject however, and the perceived risks may simply be fear mongering, but the potential issues should be kept in mind if you decide to look into them., Thick prescription glasses have an effect of visibly shrinking eyes through the lens. If you wear a heavy prescription, simply taking off your glasses will make a huge difference. Contacts are barely noticeable by contrast, and are relatively easy to adjust to. If you have the money for it, laser eye surgery can correct your vision issue permanently. A smaller set of lenses will also help to reduce the issue.

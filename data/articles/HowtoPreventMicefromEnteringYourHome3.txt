 The most likely source of food for mice that enter your house is in the kitchen. Take the following measures to make sure you aren't providing meals for mice:


Use a trashcan that has a lid, since the smell of trash can attract mice. Take out the trash frequently rather than letting it sit in your kitchen for too long.
Don't store boxes of food on the floor. Make sure everything is kept on shelves or in cabinets.
Use tightly-sealed food storage containers. Store grains, pastas, nuts and other dry goods in glass or plastic containers with tight lids. Rather than putting a half-used box of cereal or another item back on the shelf, pour its contents into a food storage container and recycle the box.
Clean up spills right away. Don't let orange juice or a spilled box of oatmeal sit on your floor for too long. Sweep and mop your kitchen floor often to remove traces of food.
 Cat food and dog food are appetizing to mice, too, and stray pieces will attract them if they're left to sit out all the time. When your pets are finished eating, put their food away. Keep the pet food in a glass or plastic container with a tight-fitting lid.
 Mice might be attracted to your property because they're finding good things to eat outside. Remove the following sources of food:


Nuts and berries that have dropped from trees. Rake these up and compost or discard them.
Birdseed that has scattered around the feeder. Clean up stray birdseed frequently, or move the feeder to a corner of your yard a that's a good distance from the house.
Spilled garbage. Prevent mice from getting into your garbage by using a can with a tight-fitting lid. If possible, store your garbage cans in a shed that's not right next to your house.

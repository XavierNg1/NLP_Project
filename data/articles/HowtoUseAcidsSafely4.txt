 The Materials Safety Data Sheet is a reference sheet that contains information on a particular chemical. It will include warnings (corrosive, explosive, flammable, etc.). It will also suggest proper safety techniques for using that particular chemical. This is the ultimate reference for the safe use of any chemical, including acids., Acids are corrosive by nature. Some more so than others. You should wear pants, closed toed shoes, and long sleeves if you plan to work with acids. You should also wear a lab apron to prevent acid from getting on your clothing and eating through it.
 Food and drink can contaminate your experiment. You also run the risk of getting acid in your food or drink if you bring it into the lab. Standard practice in all labs is to leave food and drink outside., If you are exposed to acid, you will need to rinse it off your skin thoroughly. Labs are equipped with both a shower and an eyewash that will allow you to rinse yourself in case of an accident. Never try to neutralize acid on your skin. This can cause more extreme damage.


If acid comes in contact with the eyes, wash the eyes as quickly as possible, as acid can cause serious burns in 15 seconds. Hold the eyelids open, and wash the eyes in an eyewash for fifteen minutes.
Wash away acid that comes in contact with skin. Remove clothing, then shower for fifteen minutes.
If acid is ingested, you should drink water and consumable bases such as milk of magnesia. Do not try to dilute with strong bases. Do not induce vomiting.

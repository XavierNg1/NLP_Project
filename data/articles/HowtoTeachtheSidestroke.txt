 You can start by teaching the kick on the deck, then move to the pool wall.


Teach the learning cues: "Heels up, Split, Squeeze, and Glide" (up, split, squeeze, and glide).






Make sure to demonstrate the kick as well, and have your students recite the cues as you demonstrate.






When your student is ready to progress to practicing the kick across the pool, use a kick board or water barbell (see attached video).






Be sure to manipulate the legs through the proper movement pattern.

, Try using the old “Apple Tree” analogy: "Pick an apple off the tree, put it in your other hand, drop it in the basket." (repeat). Further explain that the Sidestroke Arm Action with these cues: "Pull, Push, and Glide." Because it would be very difficult to practice the arms without the legs while swimming, teach the timing next.
 In this step, put it all together. Demonstrate the stroke first while having your students use a choral responding technique. In other words, recite the timing cues as they are demonstrated. The timing cues are: "Arms and Legs Bend, Arms and Legs Straighten." Once the students have seen it and have a general understanding of the new stroke-- get them back into the water to start practicing it!

 First, check to make sure that the clothing you have fit. If they don't, you may donate them to another family member, friend, or charity, or sell them for a good price.
 Pick a store where you can find winter clothing that will keep you warm, are stylish and comfortable, fit you, and will last., Sweaters, shawls, long sleeved shirts, and a warm and comfortable coat that you like and is affordable. Also consider getting a hat, scarf, mittens, gloves, and a high quality pair of boots made for cold weather.

Choose outfits one size larger than what you normally wear, considering that you may be dressing in multiple layers.
 Wear shirts under a sweater and a tank top under the shirt for a very cold day. You can wear leggings underneath your pants and more than one pair of socks., If it's cold with snow and ice, wear sturdy winter snow boots. If it's cold without snow and ice, you can still wear those boots mentioned above, or you can wear furry boots like Uggs., W hen you go outside, wear the winter coat you purchased, along with the hat, scarf, and gloves (if it is very cold, wear mittens underneath your gloves).

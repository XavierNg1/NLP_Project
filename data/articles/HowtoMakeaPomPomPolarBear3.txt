 Glue a one-inch (2.5 cm) pom-pom to the top of a two-inch (5 cm) pom-pom to create the head and body of your bear. Then take two mini white pom-poms and glue them to the top of the head to make the ears. Be sure to keep a little space between the ears.You can find pom-poms, wiggly eyes and chenille stems at your local crafts store.
 Glue a mini black pom-pom to the lower front of the bear’s head. Slightly above the nose, attach two small wiggly eyes. The eyes should be about halfway between the ears and the nose., Glue four mini pom-poms to the front side of the bear’s body to make the legs. Attach a fifth mini pom-pom to the back for a tail. Make sure that the two bottom legs and the tail allow the bear to sit and keep it upright. Finally, wrap a three-inch (7.6 cm) piece of red or silver chenille stem around the bear’s neck to serve as a scarf.When you attach the scarf, do not get it so snug around the bear’s neck that it pops the head off.

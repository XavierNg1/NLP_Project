 When you find someone you would like to become friends with, the simplest thing to do is to just walk up to them and introduce yourself. Tell the new person your name and something about yourself, like how you’re related to the place or event that you are both at. If the place is a school event, tell the new person what grade you’re in or what activities you participate in at the school.Try saying something like, “Hi, my name is John. I’m new here and looking to meet some new people.”
Or maybe try saying, “Hello, I’m John. I’m a junior here, but I’ve never seen you here before. What’s your name?”
Try to project some confidence during this exchange. People are more likely to engage with others who seem sure of themselves. This makes the other person feel more at ease and builds rapport at the beginning.
 One sure fire way to get to know someone and to put them at ease in a new conversation is to ask them questions about themselves. People typically enjoy talking about their own lives and sharing their experiences, so this is a great way to keep a new conversation going.Try asking about their family, job, social activities, hobbies, favorite restaurants, and other things like that. Try to ask open-ended questions that can't be answered with a simple "yes" or "no."

, Once you have established a rapport with the person and decided that you would like to continue the acquaintance, it’s time to think about making plans for the next time you’ll see each other. Try to be casual about it and not put too much pressure on the invitation. You don’t want the other person to feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed.Try saying something like, “Hey, I was thinking about trying that new Italian place downtown. Would you like to join me there some night this week?”
Or you could try inviting them over: “I really enjoyed our conversation tonight. I’d love to have you over sometime soon to hang out.”

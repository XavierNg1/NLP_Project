 Locate the Box app on your iOS device. It’s the app with a blue background with the word “box” on it. Tap on it to launch Box.
 If you’re already logged in, you may skip this step; otherwise, input your Box email address and password in the appropriate fields then tap the blue “Log in” button.
 The home screen displays all the folders in your Box account. Scroll through them.
 Navigate through your Box folders as needed by tapping on them. Stop once you’re in the folder that contains the files.
 On the upper-right side of the folder view is a folder icon; tap on it to bring out the folder details and actions on the right panel.
 On the right panel under the folder actions, tap the “Multi-select” action. This option will allow you to select and work on multiple files at once. The file list will have tick circles in front of them. Tap on the files to select them.
 At the top of the screen, action buttons will appear after the selection starts. These buttons are “Copy,” “Move,” and “Delete.”


Tap the “Copy” button to copy the selected files, and a pop-up window will appear for you to select the destination folder where the copies will be placed.
Select the destination folder and tap “Choose” from the lower-right side of the window.
 The selected files will be copied to the destination folder you’ve selected. Navigate to the destination folder and view the file from there by tapping it.

 Overreacting can be annoying in most cases. When you hear, see, or feel something that really eats at your tolerance level, stop and think about what you're about to say and do before actually saying or doing it. Otherwise it will turn out bad.;
, Sometimes jokes can go a little too far. Like if you start joking around with someone and you continuously do it every day, sooner or later the person you're joking around with is going to get to the point where they have had enough. If you do joke around a lot, make sure it is funny to them too, not just you or else they might get annoyed.
 Sometimes people find it annoying when someone is being really random out of nowhere. For example, if you're talking about sports then all of a sudden start a conversation on hairstyles.
 If your friend seems like they are annoyed by you or mad at you don't ask them if they are mad at you constantly because they will get annoyed and eventually will say they need some space. This can mean that the friendship slowly starts to grow apart.
 Simply ask "what's wrong?" or "what happened?"

, Nobody likes it when they are telling you something, or confiding in you, and you are not paying attention. If you ask a question, listen to the whole answer.
, You may be the center of your universe, but that's it. Everybody is focused on themselves; they are their own priority, like you are yours.
 Even if you are insecure, or not confident, act like you are. Fake it till you make it!

, Be your own person. You are a great individual just the way you are.

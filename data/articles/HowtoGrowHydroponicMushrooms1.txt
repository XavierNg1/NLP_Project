 Kits are blocks of compressed sawdust that have been saturated with mushroom seeds.;
, Make sure it is completely immersed; allow several inches of water to cover the top of the block.
 The mushroom block has to be thoroughly saturated.
 The temperature should range between 60ºF and 75ºF (15.6ºC to 23.8ºC).
 Most hydroponic mushrooms are ready for harvesting in 3 to 5 days.
 Immerse the block in cold water and allow it to get thoroughly saturated before you place it in a dark, cool spot.
 The number of times you can reuse your block will depend on how much time it takes for the nutrients to become depleted.
 You can then start the process over with a new mushroom kit.

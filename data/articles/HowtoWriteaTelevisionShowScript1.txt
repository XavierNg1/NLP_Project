 If you have the opportunity to choose the topic for the script prepare to give it some time. The hardest part is going from 0 to 1.Get a piece of paper or open a new document on your computer's word processor. Write down any show ideas you have in your head. Write down what is happening in your own life for inspiration.Once you have finished this list, you will have a good amount of topics to choose from.;
, Talk to people you trust about your idea. If many seem to like, it might be the right idea to invest time in. Follow your instincts.
 Even if your best topic is not the most popular, if it seems to have a chance, try it out.Â 

, Before you start writing your own story you might want to look at outside sources. This will help you get good new ideas and break with old ones. Remember, you don't want to show your producer something s/he's already seen!

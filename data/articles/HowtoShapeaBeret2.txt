 If the beret is adjustable, place it on your head and adjust to the right size. Be sure to complete this step before getting the beret wet, since a wet beret can stretch or shrink. If you are unable to adjust your beret to fit snugly on your head, you may need one of a different size., Cut out the black inner lining of the beret, but be careful not to damage the fuzzy outer layer.Removing this lining will help you more easily shape the beret. Keep in mind that not all berets will have this component.
 This is typically done after you've finished shaping your beret. However, if your beret is already visible pilled before being shaped, shave it before wetting in addition to after it's dry.In the case of casual berets, this may be the only step you need to take. There are many ways to remove fuzz from your beret:


Use a disposable razor. This is the easiest and most common method. Gently run the razor in a single direction over your beret. Make sure not to go over the same spot multiple times, as you risk wearing down the material too much.Carefully clip with scissors. This method is best if there are only a handful of obvious pills. Clip them off at the base, placing the scissors flush with the beret. Use cuticle scissors for the most precise control possible.
Burn off the fuzz with a lighter. Hold the lighter in place and carefully run your beret just over the flame without touching it. Instead of "shaving" the entire cap, go over just the areas with visible fuzz. Although this method can damage your beret if done improperly, it is sometimes considered to be the traditional way to de-pill a military beret. Exercise caution when using a lighter.

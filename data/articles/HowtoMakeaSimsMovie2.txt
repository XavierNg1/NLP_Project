 Do you want to make a Sims 2 series, or just make a music video? Also keep in mind songs. Do you want to use songs in your video? If so, which song(s)?

, You don't have to do this step since The Sims have a video record in the game, but if you find it more easier to record through a software, download one.
 That would be your "Actors cast". If you're making a music video, try to make them look like singers.
 For the scenes, you can have more money by using the Motherlode cheat, which giving you 50,000 simoleons.
 If you want, have them sit and don't move. However, this may not work if they're tired or hungry. You can use the Testingcheatsenabled True cheat and make them to be fully happy always.
 Tell your Sims what to do and start recording.
 You can use any other movie making software, but this program is one of the easier programs to edit with. Take your recordings and put in the movie maker, and add some music or dub. If you're making a series, you can also translate the Sims by making a subtitles.

 You are relying on the warm air to dry your pillow by evening.;
, Inspect its condition. If it appears ready for another year's use, then prepare it for cleaning.
 Use a gentle soap that is suitable for hand-washing.
 You can gently push it but do not knead or wring.
, Do not wring the pillow. Instead, use a bath sheet to wrap around the pillow and soak up as much excess water as possible. It is best if you do this in the bath or container (drained of water). Once the water has been absorbed as much as possible, remove the pillow to a drying space.
 Lay the pillow over a sweater drying device or over a chair back. Keep out of direct sunlight and let the warm air dry it.
 Restore pillow cover, pillowcase and return to the bed.

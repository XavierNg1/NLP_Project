 Use the same color as the pipe cleaner used for the body. To shape the wings:


Bend two more pipe cleaners into U shapes at each end, using the middle of the pipe cleaner as the dividing point for each U shape.
Then, slightly kink the middle of the pipe cleaner, as shown. Reshape the U shapes into as wing-like a shape as possible.
 To do this, wrap or fold the loose ends slightly around the body of the dragonfly, just enough to attach without taking away the wing shape. Make readjustments to the wing shape as needed.


For added effect, try pasting some colored tissue paper over the wings.
 The dragonfly can now be displayed by hanging using invisible thread. Or simply place it on a shelf or add to a craft project.


If wearing as jewelry, attach a finding such as a brooch backing, using craft glue.
Other uses include: Adding to a collage or picture, toys for children over 3, decorations on children's lunchboxes/bags/totes/water bottles, etc., attachments to gift cards or gift wrapping, a decoration for a small treasures box lid, etc.

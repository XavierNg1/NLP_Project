 In a small pot, mix the flour, egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch, vanilla extract, and eggs. Whisk until all ingredients are well mixed.
 Pour in the milk while whisking the rest of the mixture. Continue doing this until you have a uniform mixture.
 Place the pot over low heat, constantly whisking the mixture. The pastry cream will be ready when it becomes thick and smooth.

 Soak a cotton ball or cotton pad in an acetone-based nail polish remover. Wring slightly by squeezing it with your fingers to remove any excess.


The acetone in nail polish remover can be very abrasive and will remove the dyed, dead skin cells on top of your skin while also lifting up the dye.
Keep the nail polish remover away from your eyes.
Note that this method is risky to use with the sensitive skin of your face and may work better for hair dye stains on your hands.



Only rub the area a few times. Do not scrub and do not let the acetone soak your skin for long.
You should notice the dye lifting up almost immediately. If it does not, then nail polish remover may not work against your brand of hair dye.
 Thoroughly rinse the area with cool to warm water to rinse away all traces of the nail polish remover.


If some or all of the dye remains, try another method of removal.

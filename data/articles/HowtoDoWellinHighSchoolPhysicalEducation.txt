 You probably had a locker room all through middle school, but if you didn't, don't worry about people looking at you while you change. Nearly the entire time no one is watching you. Most locker rooms have a no cameras/phone policy. If yours doesn't, ask your teacher about instituting one.;
, Theft is a big issue in many locker rooms. Lock your locker at all times, even if you think no one will be in the locker room. There's nothing worse to coming back from class to find your shirt/shoes/wallet/phone/etc. missing.
 Realize you have a limited amount of time to dress, so be quick.
 "Dress cuts" effect your grade enormously. Unless you made a mistake and left your clothes at home, don't purposely decide not to dress. Even if you hate running, it's better to run slowly and get credit for the day than to get no points for the run.
 Don't cut PE because you "don't feel like it". Go to class, but just take it easy and slowly.
, Don't sprint ahead and then lose steam after the first 1/2 lap. Run at a steady rhythm and pace. Try not to stop and walk more than twice during a run. Don't worry about what place you come in--it's gym class, not the Olympics.
 You don't have to be the star player making all the points, but don't just stand there either.
 PE teachers are human, and they will most likely recognize if you're trying.



Ask your school nurse about any possible conditions that will prevent you from participating in some sports or games.

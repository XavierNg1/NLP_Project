 It shouldn't have any metal on it. In general, a simple, unadorned ceramic mug is going to work the best., Take the dry ingredients and blend them up well. Use a fork or a small whisk just to make sure they are evenly mixed and there are no large chunks.
 Don't worry if it doesn't completely mix in just yet -- you've still got the oil to add.
 You can use just about any cooking oil, but you want something that doesn't have a strong flavor. Vegetable and canola are often the best bets, but a light olive oil will do as well. You could even use coconut oil or butter, though you have to melt it before mixing it in., A fork or small whisk will do. Just mix it up until you see no more chunks of flour and cocoa. You want a nice, smooth batter., Depending on the size of the mug and the strength of the microwave, the brownie may spill over a bit when cooking. Place a plate under the mug to make your life easier during clean-up.
 Some brownies take a little less, some a little more. Start with 1 minute, then check the brownie with a fork to see if it hit your desired consistency. You can then keep cooking and checking in 30-second intervals until you have your perfect brownie.The consistency will be slightly molten and gooey, unlike a traditional brownie. Don't worry if it seems a little "wet," this is by design., There is no reason you couldn't eat the batter raw, other than it wouldn't taste very good. So if you want a gooey, wet brownie, take it out a little early. If you want something firmer and more cake-like, add an extra 20-30 seconds to the timer. You can customize it however you like.

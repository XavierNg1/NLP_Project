 Here's what you'll need to make a larger bed:


4 large couch cushions
2 large blankets
1 large pillow or 2 small pillows

, This means that you should create a square out of the four cushions.
 Make sure you place them on the bed neatly.
 Place the pillows down wherever you and your sleeping partner would like to place your heads. After that, you're all done!

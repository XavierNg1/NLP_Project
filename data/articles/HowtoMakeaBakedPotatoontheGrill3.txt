 Rinse your potatoes with cool water and scrub them with a soft sponge.
 Most potatoes have a few green or brown spots. Use a sharp knife or vegetable peeler to cut these parts away.
 Remove the skin by peeling with a vegetable peeler or using a sharp utility knife. Remove all the skin and then remove any green spots or blemishes that remain. When the potato is completely peeled, place it in cold water immediately until ready to cook or ready to cut to desired size.


The cold water will prevent the outer surface of the potato from discoloring.
Always peel or cut away from your hand when skinning potatoes.
 Cut lengthwise into 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick slices. Leave your potatoes in slices to make wedges or cut again into chunks.
 Brush your potatoes immediately with cooking oil and seasonings.


Brushing potatoes right away prevents them from turning brown and sticking to the grate when placed on the grill.
In a small bowl, mix cooking oil with a small amount of butter, salt, pepper, and garlic for a tasty seasoning spread.
 Place them toward the center of the grill with one of the cut sides down. If you cut your potato pieces into chunks, you can place them on a piece of foil or on skewers before putting them on the grill to keep from loosing them in-between the grates.
 Adjust your grill to medium heat and cook for 5 to 6 minutes and turn to the other cut side. Cook on second side for 5 to 6 minutes and then turn wedges so the skin side is down. Finish cooking until tender. Potato wedges should be nicely brown. Serve while hot.

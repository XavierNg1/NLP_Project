 You can also use a silicone baking sheet instead.
 If you can try to use coarsely-grated Parmesan cheese and not the finely-grated, powdery kind. The finely-grated, powdery kind of Parmesan cheese will melt, but it won't create that pretty, lacey design.
 Avoid making the mound too thick, or it will be too chewy and not crispy enough once it bakes.You can do this using your fingers or the back of a spoon. Make sure that it is the same thickness throughout.
 You have enough cheese to make more mounds, but it would be a better idea to bake them in small batches. Once you take them out of the oven, you will have to work quickly in order to shape them into baskets. If you make them all at once, half of the crisps will become too hard to work with by the time you get to them., They are ready when they turn bubbly and a light, golden color., They should still be warm and pliable, but not so hot that you can't handle them., Use your fingers to gently press the crisps over the top and sides of the mold. Don't worry if the edges become ruffles; that is part of the design! You can use anything that is small and cylindrical as a mold, such as:Upturned shot glasses
Upturned egg cartons
Upturned mini muffin tins
Wine corks

, While your current batch is cooling, you can work on baking your next batch.
 You can fill them with just about anything that pairs well with Parmesan cheese, including mini meatballs, goat cheese, cherry tomatoes, and so forth! Step up the presentation with a small garnish, such as a basil leaf or parsley leaf.

 Depending on your phone, just search for the app either at the Google Play Store or the App Store. Once you find it, click on the Facebook icon, and then click on Download to install the app.
 Once the app is installed, you can find it among the downloaded files on your phone by clicking on the Downloads icon on your home screen.
 Once you have the app opened and the sign-in screen is displayed, fill in the boxes with your username and password, and click on the “Sign In” tab.
 You’ll find this among the three options at the bottom of the screen you land on after signing in.
 Click on the white box that says “What’s on your mind?” and type in your new status. Once you’re done, look for the four gray icons right below your status. Tap on the fourth one, the one that looks like a GPS marker.
 A list will pop up of all known locations around the area. Tap on the correct one, and afterwards, click on the “Post” button on the top right side of your phone screen to add the location to your post.

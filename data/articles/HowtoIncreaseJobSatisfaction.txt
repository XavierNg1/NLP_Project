 Knowing what you're good at (and thereby not good at) may lead you on a path to knowing where your skills may lead you best.;
, Don't select a job in which you are weak. Your liking for the job is utmost important to get higher satisfaction.
 Take the time to perform all your job duties to their fullest.
 There is no replacement for this.
 Although you may think you know everything there is about a job, there's always something new to learn. Don't just skip out on meetings or training classes just because you know everything there could be to the job. There may just a be a tidbit of information you may have forgotten, and the course may be only a small bit valuable.
 Be patient and wait for your job to finish before handing in a resignation letter. Don't expect returns immediately for your job done. Keep patience.
 You have got your own brain and efforts.Go on working till you get maximum satisfaction.Of course every one has his own limitations.
 Jot down a few notes of what you need to get done during each day, in order of importance.
 This will help you adjust to understanding potential conflicts in your day.
 Relax! Your life will mean more than the work. You'll feel refreshed, knowing that you'll get the work done later while still being productive.
 If you tend to eat "junk" food, your body will establish this ritual and make you feel like you yourself are "junk". Add good/healthy foods and you'll achieve a good working relationship.
 Think of your job as an adventure. Stay positive for the positive aspects of any job you partake to doing.

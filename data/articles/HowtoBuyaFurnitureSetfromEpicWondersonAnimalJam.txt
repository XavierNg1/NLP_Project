 Most of the nice furniture from the expensive store, Epic Wonders, is for members. Do not use free membership generators, as they are just viruses and malware. Instead, ask a parent, guardian, or friend to buy you a membership from the Animal Jam site if you do not already have one.;
, Nice furniture will look better and fit better in a nice den. Examples of nice dens are the Beach House, Fantasy Castle, and Sky Kingdom. The Beach house has three big rooms, a balcony, an ocean, and a plateau. The Sky Kingdom has a main castle and several other areas of land. The fantasy castle has 2 rooms and 2 small balconies. The den has to be big enough to fit the furniture set you want.
 You can go to Jam Mart furniture if you want, but Jam Mart sells furniture pieces not sets. It is better to shop at Epic Wonders, which is an expensive high quality store inside the waterfall of Coral Canyons. Make sure you have at least 1,500 gems with you before entering the store. Then buy 1 piece of furniture from the set.
 After you buy a piece of furniture, go back to your den and recycle any unwanted things. You will be surprised by how many gems this gets you.
 Once you have enough money go to Epic Wonders and buy all of the furniture from your chosen set.
 Arrange the items so they are not to cluttered and they go in the right place. Then buy extras.

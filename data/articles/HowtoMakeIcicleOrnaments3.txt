 Wax paper is a little different than parchment paper, and if you don't lubricate it with dish soap, the icicles will stick., You can use ordinary, clear hot glue sticks, or you can use the glittery kind. Silver, gold, or iridescent would all work well for icicles., If you'd like, you can vary the pressure on your hot glue gun while squeezing it to create lumps. You can also go back, and make the top part of each icicle thicker.
 White or iridescent glitter would work the best, but silver or gold would look nice too. If you used glittery hot glue sticks, then you can skip this step since they are already sparkly.
 If you used plain hot glue, you may notice it turning slightly foggy, which is normal.If the glue is taking too long to set, stick the parchment paper into the fridge or freezer for a few minutes.
 Hot glue sometimes leaves behind "whiskers" or threads, which can make your icicles look messy. If you got any of those, carefully peel them away.


At this point, you can flip the icicles over, and draw some glue on the back to make them more dimensional.
 If you have a very sharp needle, you can thread the needle, then pull the needle through the top of each icicle instead.


Clear thread will work best for this.

 During the dormant period while your plants are in a cool location, check them at least every 2 weeks.


Remove any part of the bulb that is black or off colored. Check for foul smells and remove any diseased or damaged pieces.
If the bulbs are dry to the touch mist them with a spray bottle and place them back into the moist soil.
 After the cool months arrive, take out the bulbs and give them a final inspection.


Throw away any shriveled, black, mushy, or bad smelling bulbs.
Also you’ll want to toss any bulbs that didn’t produce bulblets while in storage.
 Place the bulbs back into the ground and cover them. They should bloom in the spring and when dug up the next year will have 20-30 bulblets growing from the sides.

 The easiest way to know if your bottom drawer is simply a storage drawer is to read the instructions that came with the oven. If you don’t have the instructions, you can look up your oven model online and read about the product features. The bottom drawer is most likely a storage drawer if it doesn’t have settings or a heating element., Many warming drawers come with several temperature settings. Typically, there will be a setting for high, medium, and low temperatures. Seafood, poultry, and other types of meat should be kept at a medium or high setting. If you are cooking multiple foods at once, keep the finished food that requires the lowest temperature in the drawer., Warming drawers are typically used to help foods that are already warm, stay warm, instead of heating cold foods up. Use a warming drawer when you are cooking multiple foods at once and want one part of the meal that was prepared earlier to stay warm. For example, keep the dessert warming in the drawer while the main course is cooking., Warming drawers often come with a humidity controller. You can use this option to keep foods from drying out. For instance, keep your bread rolls in the warming drawer to prevent them from drying out, or adjust the humidity to keep your French fries crisp., A warming drawer is slightly different from a broiler. It does keep food warm, but it is not meant to cook the food. Attempting to cook food in the warming drawer can be dangerous because bacteria can develop at a low temperature.Some warming drawers have a slow cooker option. Read your manual to see if your oven has this option.

 Wash your face, take regular showers, eat home cooked meals instead of ready-made ones, etc.


Always make sure to brush your teeth 2-3 times a day. This will keep them clean and your breath smelling good.
 You don't have to go crazy, but a little bit of physical activity each day, such as biking to school, will help keep both your body and mind healthy.
 Eating too much or too little will make it hard to focus and cause you to do poorly in other areas.
 Having about 9 hours sleep is the best thing to be doing, even on weekends; it will prepare you for school and make yourself feel better the following morning. Try to schedule each week so that you get your homework done at a reasonable hour. If you know you're going to have a lot on a given night, talk to your teacher about getting an extension, or even better, handing it in early. This will make your body more aware of what's going on, and will make any dreadful bags under your eyes disappear!

, Make sure you have enough time to have some breakfast, wash your face, have a shower if you need to, etc. before school starts.


Packing your bag and hanging up your outfit/uniform the night before will make everything a lot faster and more organized. Don't forget to lay out a clean pair of socks, underwear and a pair of shoes also!

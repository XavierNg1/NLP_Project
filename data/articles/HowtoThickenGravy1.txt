 You can buy both of these items at your local grocery store. Flour or cornstarch will help to thicken any sauce, and gravy is no exception. As long as you can avoid making lumps this option is the fastest way to thicken your gravy.;
, You should put slightly more water than cornstarch or flour. There are no exact measurements here because it all depends on the amount of gravy that you have. This isn’t an exact science so you’ll have to eyeball it, but you should use approximately two tablespoons of cornstarch per cup of gravy. Make sure that you make this mix in a separate bowl. Stir thoroughly until smooth.
 Don’t pour it in all at once, make sure you do this very gradually. Pour a little bit, stir, and then pour some more. Continue this process until all of your mixture is in the gravy. Now give the gravy another good stir to get rid of any cornstarch lumps that might still be in there. , When the gravy takes on a viscous look it’s probably ready to go. You can also taste it with a spoon to see if it has reached the thickness you wanted. It’s all about your own personal taste. Just don’t let it burn. Now you are ready to serve your gravy!

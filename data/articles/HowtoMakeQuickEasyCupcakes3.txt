, If you don't have liners, grease the cups using vegetable oil or butter to keep the cupcakes from sticking.
 Into a large bowl, add the strawberry jam, milk, vanilla, butter, eggs and sugar. Beat the mixture well to fully incorporate the ingredients.
 Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt.
 Use a spatula to gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet until just combined. Be sure not to overmix, since mixing too much can cause these cupcakes to turn out dense.
 Fill each one 2/3 way full. Leaving extra space will give the cupcakes room to rise without spilling over the rims.
 Test to see whether the cupcakes are done by inserting a toothpick into the center of a cupcake. If it comes out clean, they're ready. If it's still wet, bake the cupcakes for another five minutes., Place them on a wire rack or on the counter to cool completely. If you frost them too quickly, the icing will melt off.

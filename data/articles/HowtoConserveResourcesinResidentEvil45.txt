 Just about everything here dies in one hit to a good Rocket Launcher.  


No bullets are needed to fight Del Lago, so luckily conservation isn't an issue there.
  You can then mount it with the action button and hack away.  Doing this twice should cut it, no pun intended.
 This guy is very, very weak to fire.  Once you separate his torso and legs, it only takes three or four incendiary grenades to kill him.
 You can get a free Rocket Launcher before this.  Freeze him with a nitrogen canister, and blow him up.
 Then blow him away with the magnum!

,  The normally pitiful damage is increased exponentially- you only need to hit him with your knife about twelve times during the final showdown on professional, and it's easy to bait him into missing on his attacks.
 Nothing else for it but a good old fashioned beat down.  Blast it with the Striker and Magnum!

, Just like Salazar, shoot the eye. Hit the weak point with a Magnum.

 Allow the hot glue gun to warm up.


Don't let your kids use the glue gun themselves. It's hot, and can cause burns.;
, Slide the glue stick in a zigzag motion all over the back side of the construction paper to create a smooth layer of glue across the construction paper.
 Allow glue to dry.
 Move the knife cautiously in a forward and backward motion.
 Cut the caps off of the remaining plastic water bottles. You should have thirteen caps in total.
 All you need is a single layer of hot glue around the bottom rim of the cap.
, By now, you should have all thirteen caps glued to the piece of cardboard.


The bottle caps should be glued down the middle and right margin of the piece of cardboard with 1/2 an inch in between the caps vertically.
 Meanwhile, unplug the hot glue gun carefully. Unplug the hot glue gun and let it cool off., Write one multiplication per bottle cap.


Ex: 8 x 0, 8 x 1, 8 x 2 up to 8 x 12.
 Remove all the caps off from the piece of cardboard by twisting the top part of the bottle cap off.
 Use the permanent marker.
 Your children will be able to uncap and recap the bottle tops, like a puzzle. This way, they learn their multiplication tables as they play!

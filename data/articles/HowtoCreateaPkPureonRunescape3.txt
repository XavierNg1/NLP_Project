 This is the most expensive skill yet unless you craft your own runes. Crafting is recommended because it will save you a lot of money.
 Buy an air staff and cast on men and woman. Pick up coins.
 Go to fist of Guthix and train there. Fiona will give you a stack of runes that work like normal runes. Keep casting spells and curses to level up fast. Buy battle robes with the tokens you earn.
 This will give you access to the legendary ice barrage. This freezes people and causes damage to them. Go to Bounty hunter and continuously cast ice barrage on them. You will win most of the battles.

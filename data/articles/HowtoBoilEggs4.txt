 The best eggs for hard-boiling are eggs that are several days old. A fresh egg will be much harder to peel as the white still sticks to the shell. If you are planning on peeling the hard-boiled egg for other uses, keep this in mind if boiling eggs freshly collected from your hens.
 Add salt or vinegar to the water if you accidentally crack an egg. It may help the proteins in the egg white thicken faster to plug the cracks in the shell.
 Leave about 1 inch (3 cm) of water over them. Use cold water to help keep the eggs from overcooking, although doing this increases the cooking time.
 This can make the eggs easier to peel because, as mentioned earlier, the proteins coagulate and firm up, making the white easier to separate from the shell. Also, eggs that are less fresh are easier to peel because their higher pH strengthens the membrane. (This can be simulated by making the cooking water more alkaline with a half teaspoon of baking soda per quart of water.)







, Bring the water to the point of boiling, over high heat. From here, there are different approaches to the boiling times and methods:









This following method assumes you started with cold, refrigerated eggs. As soon as the water boils, turn off the heat, but keep the pot on the warm stove. Do not remove the lid. Leave the eggs in the hot water for ten to fifteen minutes.It is important you do not start the timer until the water starts boiling, and that you turn off the heat. Too much time will make the eggs discolored and smelly, while too little time will cause them to be runny.

The Larousse Gastronomique recommends that eggs (room temperature) should be cooked for 10-12 minutes and then plunged into cold water for 7-8 minutes. This will allow them to cool prior to shelling., Chill the eggs by placing them under cold running water or in a bowl of ice water. Let them sit for a few minutes until the eggs are cool.

 You need to be able to commit the necessary amount of time to be at rehearsals and concerts. Because you get paid to be in the orchestra, you need to earn your money. If you have sloppy attendance, you will not be familiar with the music and you could get fired. Make sure that your schedule allows plenty of time for rehearsals, concerts, and most importantly, practice! If you are already a very busy person, you will need to prioritize.;
, Each orchestra works differently. Some orchestras hold auditions every year while others only hold auditions when someone leaves. Find out when the orchestra you're interested in holds auditions and book your audition time as soon as you can so you get first dibs. Some orchestras hold special auditions for principal players. In other words, when the principal of a section leaves, there will be a "competition" for those interested in replacing him/her. If you are interested in becoming a principal of a section, make sure you find out the requirements for that.
 Some orchestras might hold an interview before/after the audition. Check to see if the orchestra requires you to hand in something (i.e. resume) If you need to prepare a resume, make sure you include any previous orchestral experience, previous work experience, awards you have won, etc.
 Listen to recordings of the pieces that the excerpts come from and become familiar with the style, tempo, and musical interpretation. If you are still taking music lessons, go over the audition material with your teacher. Practice frequently!

, Make sure you eat breakfast that morning. Dress as if you were going to a job interview. Warm up before leaving. Warm up again when you get there.
 When you are done, leave the room confidently.

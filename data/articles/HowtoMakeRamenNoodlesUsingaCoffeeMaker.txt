 Smaller pieces are easier to heat up rather than an entire block.;
, Make sure that any block pieces are evenly placed so that they're not stacking on top of each other.
 Put the seasoning into the coffee filter. Add about 2 cups (475 ml) of water into the reservoir of the coffee maker.
 Remove and throw away the used coffee filter.
 The coffee pot will be hot, so do this with care.
 Serve and enjoy!

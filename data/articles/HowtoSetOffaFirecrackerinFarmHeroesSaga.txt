 Farm Heroes Saga can be played online within Facebook, or you can play the game’s mobile app. Launch the game, and hit the “Play” button.;
, From the game map, tap or click the level you want to play. Firecrackers first appear on level 356.


Not all levels after 356 have firecrackers.
 Levels with firecrackers already have them on the board. They appear just like your other cropsies, and they are shaped like a rocket with a rope running around them. Find them on the board, and check and plan for good matches around it., In order to set off a firecracker, you need to make three different matches right next to it. Look at the cropsies surrounding the firecrackers, and plan your moves.
 Identify a firecracker you want to set off. It will first appear to be sleeping. Swap cropsies right next to it to make your first match. The cropsies will be removed, and the firecracker will awaken with its rope, or wick, starting to burn.
 You don’t need to work on the same firecracker on consecutive moves. You can move cropsies elsewhere. Swap cropsies from the surrounding cropsies to make your second match. The cropsies will be removed, and the firecracker will have its rope or wick burned shorter.
 Swap cropsies from the surrounding cropsies to make your third match. The cropsies will be removed, and the firecracker will be set off. It will explode and take out or collect cropsies or elements you need for the level.
 Focus on completing the goals for the level, and use the other firecrackers on the board to help you do that. You don’t need to set off all the firecrackers if they’re not needed.

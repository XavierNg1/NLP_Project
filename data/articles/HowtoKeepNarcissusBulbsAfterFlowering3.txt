 Indoor or container-planted daffodils can be moved outside for planting in the ground after flowering. The best time to do this is after they flower and when the foliage has died back. This will typically be in the summer.
 As sunny patch is necessary, as the daffodils require sunlight to grow. Well-draining soil is necessary because narcissus bulbs rot easily in wet ground. Also remember to weed the area where you’ll be planting.
 Incorporate plenty of compost or organic matter (such as well-rotted horse manure) into the soil before planting. If you aren't sure how much to use, cover your soil with the organic matter to a depth of 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm), then dig it into the ground to a spade’s depth.
 That’s approximately 6 inches (15.2 cm) of depth for a 2 inch (5.1 cm) bulb. It’s good to add a trowel full of compost to the bottom of the hole for the bulb to sit on. Put the bulb in the hole with the pointed end facing upwards.
 You might like to top-dress with a layer of fertilizer or mulch. Narcissus bulbs that have been relocated to the ground should flower again the following spring.

 Unless a recipe gives you a specific description of texture, butter is considered soft when it's about room temperature. It can easily be squished by a spoon, but still keeps its shape when left alone.
 There are several common methods of softening butter described below. For any of these methods, however, the butter will soften more quickly if cut into small cubes first.
 If the butter isn't frozen and the room is warm, small pieces of butter may only take a few minutes to soften. This is especially easy if you have the oven on nearby, or if the oven's top tends to stay warm constantly due to a pilot light.


Do not place the butter directly on top of a warm oven, unless it is frozen. Keep an eye on butter in hot places to make sure it doesn't melt, as this can happen rapidly.
 To speed up the softening process, use electric mixer, or use this tip to easily mash the butter by hand. Stick the butter in a sealed zip lock bag with most of the air squeezed out. Using a rolling pin, your hands, or any heavy object, roll or mash the butter repeatedly.After a few minutes, the butter should feel significantly softer, without any signs of melting.


Instead of a zip lock bag, you could put the butter between two sheets of parchment paper or wax paper.
 Fill a large bowl partway full of warm water, avoiding steaming hot water. Put the butter in a sealed zip lock bag or in a smaller bowl resting in the water bath. Keep a close eye on the butter and poke it occasionally to check the texture, as this method should only take a couple minutes to soften refrigerated butter., If you can't wait for frozen butter to thaw, grate it using a coarse, large-hole grater. The grated shreds of butter should thaw and soften within a few minutes in a warm room.

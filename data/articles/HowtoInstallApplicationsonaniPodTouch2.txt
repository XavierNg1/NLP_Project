 In order to connect to the iTunes store, you will need to have the latest version of iTunes installed on your computer. See this guide for details on updating iTunes.
 Click the Store menu and select Home. At the top of the window, click the "App Store" section. Click the "iPhone" tab to load iPhone and iPod Touch apps.
 You can use the search bar to look for specific apps, or you can browse through the categories on the main page.


If this is your first iPod, check out the "New to the App Store?" section. This contains a selection of Apps that Apple feels are essential for most users.
 When you select an app, you will see various details about it, including price, description, user reviews, and details on the company that created it. If you don't know much about the app, give the reviews a quick look over. You may be able to discover potential problems with the app.


This is especially important if you're going to be purchasing the app. You don't want to buy an app that ends up not working properly.
 If the app costs money, the price will be listed below the app image. Click the price to purchase the app. If the app is free, it will say "Free" beneath the app image. Click "Free" to add it to your app list.


You will need to have a credit card associated with your Apple ID, or you will need to have redeemed an iTunes gift card.
You may be asked to enter your Apple ID password if your account is set to ask for passwords upon purchase.
 Your iPod will appear in the Devices menu of iTunes.
 This usually happens automatically. You can monitor the sync progress int eh display at the top of the window. If it doesn't sync automatically, select your iPod from the Devices menu, select the "Apps" tab, check the box next to the app you want to install, and click Apply

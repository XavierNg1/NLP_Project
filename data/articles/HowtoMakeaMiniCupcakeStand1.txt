 You’ll need cake boards that are 1×8″ (20cm), 1×10″ (25cm) and 1×12″ (30cm). You want to add more tiers, add 1×14″ + 1×16″ cake boards.;
, Buy each cake dummy at approximately 2” (5cm) high.
 The paper and ribbon will be a big part of your display so use paper and ribbon that either match the party theme or that complement your mini cupcakes. You will also need an entire spool of ribbon, as you will be winding it around your cake dummies.

 Middies run for the mass majority of the game. Running is necessary if you want to play this position. Jog at least once a day. I recommend jogging a mile while using the sprint jog technique. Sprint for 30 seconds, then jog for 1 minute. This helps your heart get ready for the harsh running. In a typical game, you will be running on and off for about 1.5 miles (2.4Â km).

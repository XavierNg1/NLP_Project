 The Forest Longhorn Beetle and its larvae are only found on trees in the forest. Look for large bore holes that can be up to 10 mm (3/8 inch) across, much larger than most household woodworms. Note that tunnels will be very discreet and run against the grain of the wood., Waney Edge Borer woodworm can be found in wood that has bark on it, and is rarely found in homes. Look for borer dust with bun-shaped pellets around the bark areas from the boring holes. The holes are usually around 2 mm (1/16 inches) in diameter., Ambrosia Beetle woodworm is generally found in the forest; this woodworm can’t survive in treated lumber, and only lives outdoors. Unlike other woodworm species, the adult does the tunneling, going against the grain and deep into the wood. Look for black-colored tunnels that are evident after trees are damaged or wood is cut (in a lumber yard, for example.), Wood Boring Weevil woodworm can be found in wood damaged by fungal decay. You can identify this woodworm by looking for tiny holes with ragged bore holes and coarse dust. Look for tunnels that run against the grain and often break the surface of the damaged wood., Powder post woodworm is generally found in seasoned hardwood, which is usually only found in furniture factories and lumber yards. These woodworms tunnel along the grain of the wood, and don’t attack old wood (wood that is more than 15 years old). Look for tiny entry and exit bore holes no larger than 2 mm (1/16 inch), and loose, flour-like dust., Deathwatch Beetle woodworm can be found in hardwood, (usually oak), that is partially decayed. Look for bore holes that measure up to 3 mm (1/8 inch) across, and boring dust containing large bun-shaped pellets that are visible without any magnification. If possible, inspect the interior of the wood; more extensive damage occurs inside the wood than what is visible externally.

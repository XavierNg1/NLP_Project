 Is it really that bad?Just a random out of the blue insult is nothing to get worked up about. If it gets so bad They're following you come up with a come back..;
, This may sound easy but many people get bugged because they're afraid to say anything. There is a list of comebacks in the tips section.
 You don't want them to report you. If they still follow you, report abuse and then log out. Then log in to a different world.


Be polite to people, there is no need for comebacks, if you just turn your chat off.

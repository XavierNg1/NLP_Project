 Afterwards, stick one big marshmallow onto the bottom of the toothpick and keep pushing the marshmallow until it reaches the mini marshmallow., These will be the hands of the mini marsham., Use a food pen/marker to draw eyes, a nose, mouth, eyebrows, etc. Now you have your mini marsham!

Never use a ordinary marker, you must use a food marker.

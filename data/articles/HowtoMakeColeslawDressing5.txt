 Place the capers on a plate and roughly chop them into smaller pieces using a knife with a sharp, smooth blade.


Use a plate or cutting board with a shallow lip to catch and capers that go flying off as you attempt to cut them.
 Whisk together the mayonnaise, yogurt, chopped capers, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, lemon zest, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.


When ready, there should be no visible streaks of mustard running through the dressing and the consistency should be even throughout.
 If you prefer coleslaw with a bit of heat, you can add roughly 1 tsp (5 ml) of hot sauce to the dressing.


Whisk well to combine, making sure that there are no visible streaks of hot sauce running through the dressing.
 Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes, or until you are otherwise ready to mix and serve your coleslaw.


Fold your coleslaw mix into the dressing, thoroughly coating all the vegetables with dressing.

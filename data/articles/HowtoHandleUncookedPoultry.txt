 If you plan on purchasing chicken, make sure your last stop of the day before heading home is the grocery store so the chicken doesn't get warm in your car. Also, avoid spending lots of time in the grocery store after picking up chicken. If it's warm outside, carry along an insulated bag or cooler to place the chicken in on your way home from the store in order to keep it cold.;
, While waiting for your groceries to be bagged (or when bagging them yourself), ask that your chicken be wrapped in a plastic bag to prevent leakage that could cross contaminate other vegetables, fruit or meat you may have purchased. This also applies when you put the chicken in your refrigerator when you get home.
 You can freeze the chicken in its original packaging or put it into an airtight, leak-proof container. If you plan on freezing it for two months or more, wrap the package with a freezer bag, freezer paper, tin foil or plastic wrap to help prevent your chicken or poultry from getting freezer burned. All poultry should be frozen at 0 degrees F (-18 degrees C).
 There are three main ways that are acceptable for defrosting chicken. Place it in your refrigerator (still wrapped up to prevent leakage) and allow it to thaw overnight or a full day. Run a sink full of cold water and place the wrapped chicken into it. Change the water every 30 minutes or so to ensure the chicken is defrosted gradually. It may take one to three hours to defrost it, depending on the size and type of poultry. (A whole turkey may take much longer.) You can microwave chicken to defrost it, but cook it immediately. Some parts of the chicken may have gotten warm, so it needs to be cooked as soon as possible.
 Check it with a meat thermometer.
 Touching other food items, or using utensils that touched the chicken on other food items, may transfer bacteria that can cause food-borne illnesses.

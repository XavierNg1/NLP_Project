 The faster you move, the more unpredictable your bicycle will be. Your speed should be enough to coast over the ice.;
, Avoid ruts, bumps or off camber spots. Aim your bike toward any patch of road that has more grip, for example exposed asphalt, or snow.
 This is just in case you lose control of the bicycle to prevent falling over.
 Do not turn if possible.
 Don't pedal as your rear wheel will most likely slip and put you off balance.

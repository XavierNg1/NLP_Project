 Butterflies come out during the day and are seen around spring and half of summer. Fireflies come out during the night and are seen during summer.
 They will appear somewhere in the front of your house on the lot. They'll always be in a group, but won't stick around for a long time., It will give you an option of "Catch Butterflies" or "Catch Fireflies".,, The Sim will then go inside and place the jar on a table. Everyone can either "View" or "Release" the creatures. Releasing will make the Sim go to the street with the jar and let the bugs free.

Ask local repair shops or garages if they have an internship program you can participate in or if you can shadow an employee to learn about car engines; especially if you lack experience in the automotive field.
 This procedure can be a fun and helpful way to learn about car engines; especially if your friends or neighbors are car enthusiasts or are experienced with performing certain types of auto repair.

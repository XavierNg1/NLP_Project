 Some people or objects might be labeled to identify them. Often these labels are placed so that the viewer will know what a particular object represents. For instance, a person in a suit might be labeled “Congress,” or a briefcase might be labeled with a certain company’s name.
 People in a cartoon will often speak to each other in the cartoon. Alternately, they will “think” something. Read what people are saying in the cartoon.


Text bubbles are usually represented by solid circles or boxes around the text. Thought bubbles usually look like small clouds.
 Some political cartoons have captions. These are words or phrases that are placed at the bottom of the cartoon. They give more information or interpretation to what is happening in the cartoon itself.
 The cartoon might also have one or more words in smaller print. These are intended to convey minor themes. They might be found in the background or on the edges of the cartoon.
 Once you’ve identified the symbols and other visual elements in the cartoon, think about how the words help describe them. What do the words add? How do the words enhance your understanding of the pictures and symbols?

 Is it big, or is it small? Does it have enough room for enough toys for your parrot?


Make sure that the cage is big. Big cages should have enough room for toys.;
, A good way to find out how many toys would be perfect would be to use the following tips:


Get at least seven toys. Put them in the cage. Put the parrot in the cage. If you think the toys take up too much room, take away some of them.

Lots of toys that take up too much room is not good, but an inadequate number of toys isn't good either. Parrots are very smart, and need to keep themselves happy and playful. Thus, they need enough toys to play with, rather than few toys to play with. However, getting the parrot too many toys may not be a good idea.
 Unsafe toys are harmful for any kind of pet. Signs that they are not safe are:


Sharp pieces
Loose pieces
Pieces that are easy to swallow

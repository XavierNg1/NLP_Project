 Normally called a highlighter shade, this is typically a creamy nude eyeshadow. Use your stiff flat brush to put this on the inner corners of your eyes, sweeping it up and down to gather just slightly on the upper and lower lash line. Apply a light sweep of it as well just below your eyebrows.
 Take your color that is one step darker than your lightest - your medium shade. Use your flat brush to pat this color over the entirety of your lid, from your lash line to your crease. Donâ€™t go too much further above your crease or outwards from the corner of your eye.
 Use your dome brush with your darkest eyeshadow color to contour your eyelid. Start at the outside corner of your eye, and sweep the brush in a half-moon motion up and around to the center of your crease. Keep the shadow the darkest along your lash line, and fade it out as you move up. Feel free to draw the shadow up towards the end of your eyebrow a bit for an angled fan.
 Clean your dome brush with antibacterial brush cleaner or soap and water, and dry it on a clean towel. Use your clean brush to blend along the edges of your shadow so that they fade nicely into your skin tone, as well as along your eyelid so that your three colors blend together. Use soft, sweeping brush strokes to blend the shadows.

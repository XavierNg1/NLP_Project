Make sure to update your page with relevant content at least weekly in order to keep people engaged. Lack of content reflects poorly on your organization and will make people un-subscribe.
On the flip side, too many updates can also lead people to un-subscribe. How often you should post depends on your organization (e.g., news websites might want to post daily in addition to any breaking news, while a fashion company may only want to update three times a week). Pay attention to user feedback and customer expectations.

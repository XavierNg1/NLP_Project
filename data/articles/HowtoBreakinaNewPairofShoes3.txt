 Get the shoes on your feet, preferably with socks, and walk around for no more than 10 minutes. This is just to get them prepped.
 If the shoe permits, bend it upwards and downwards a few times.
 Heating the shoe will expand the material, especially if it's leather, making it more supple.









Use a hair drier, turned to a hot (but maybe not hottest) setting, and heat the shoe up for 2 to 3 minutes.
If you don't have a hair drier, try placing your shoes next to an indoor heater, or even directly out in the sun. Some heat is better than no heat.
 Wear them around for another 10 minutes, walking, sitting, or even running.
 Your shoes will be tangibly more comfortable after a couple heat treatments.

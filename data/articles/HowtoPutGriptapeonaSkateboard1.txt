 Look for brand names that are dedicated to grip tape, such as Alien Ware, Speed Demons, Mob, Black Magic, Grizzly, and Jessup.;
, This can be the ground, a table, or any other comfortable space.
 Peeling off the old tape is simple, but it takes time. Using a hair dryer can help. Pull it slowly and carefully away from the deck. If you are too rough or hasty, the tape may rip and tear, making the job harder.
 Rid the deck of dust, dirt, rocksâ€”anything that could ruin the tape's adhesive. You'll need it to be as clean as possible, so that your new griptape sticks to your skateboard longer.
 Many skate shops will put griptape onto your board for you, although it may be cheaper to do it yourself. At the very least, consider visiting a skate shop and asking for help if you are still unsure about the process.

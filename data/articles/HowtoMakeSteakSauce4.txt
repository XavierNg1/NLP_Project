 Place the beans, brown sugar, honey, five-spice powder, ginger, red pepper flakes, sesame seeds, cider vinegar, soy sauce, and water in a food processor. Blend them together on medium to high speed until a thick, smooth puree forms.


If you don't have a food processor, a blender should also work. Note that you may need to stir the puree in between pulses to ensure even blending, though.
 Set the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat. Allow the puree to reach a steady simmer.
 Reduce the heat to medium and allow the sauce to continue simmering for 5 minutes.


Stir the sauce constantly as it simmers. When finished, it should be thicker and glossier than before.
 Remove the saucepan from the stove. Allow the sauce to cool to room temperature before serving it.


Store extra sauce by pouring it into a sealed plastic or glass container and keeping it in the refrigerator. It should remain good for one to two weeks.
Serve the sauce at room temperature or slightly warmed for the best taste.

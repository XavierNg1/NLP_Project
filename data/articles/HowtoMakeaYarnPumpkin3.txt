 If you can't find one, you can use a Styrofoam ball instead, then do the following:Use a saw or serrated knife to cut the bottom off of the ball so that it will sit flat and not roll around.
Use a knife or a pair of scissors to drill a hole in the top of the ball for the stem.
Fill the hole with some hot glue, then insert a short wooden stick; you can also use a cork.
 You can use any color of yarn you want for this, but you might make your pumpkin look more recognizable if you use orange. You can also use any weight yarn for this project, including chunky!

, Make sure that each round of yarn is touching so that no pumpkin (or Styrofoam) is showing. Also, be sure to place some glue into the grooves of the pumpkin to enhance their rippled shape.There are lots of different ways you can wrap your pumpkin:Wrap the pumpkin vertically, from base to stem. Use a separate piece of yarn for each wrap.
Wrap the pumpkin horizontally in a spiral from bottom to top, using one, long piece of yarn.
Wrap the yarn in triangular-shape spirals around the pumpkin.
 Although not necessary, this can give your pumpkin a nice, consistent look. Use a drop of hot glue at the base and tip of the stem to secure the yarn.For a rustic look, try jute cord instead.
If you made your pumpkin out of a Styrofoam ball, consider leaving the cork or stick stem bare for a more rustic look.
 Trim off any loose bits of yarn, and glue down any bits that stick up. Set your pumpkin down some place visible so that you can take pride in your work!

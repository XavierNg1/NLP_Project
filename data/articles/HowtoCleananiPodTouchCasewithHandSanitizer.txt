 If your case just covers the back, the alcohol can damage the screen. If your case covers the entire iPod, you can leave it on.
 You want a hand sanitizer without the cleansing beads, as they can embed themselves in inopportune places such as speaker holes., Squeeze a liberal amount of hand sanitizer onto the iPod case., Using your hands or a non-paper cloth, rub the hand sanitizer into the case. Your hand/cloth will spread the hand sanitizer across the case, sanitizing it., For a deeper clean, use a cotton swab to clean the crevasses of the case., Some hand sanitizer may have remained on the case. As hand sanitizer is corrosive and may damage the sensitive electronics, be sure to dry the case before putting it back on. Leaving it out will let the alcohol evaporate, removing all wetness., Your iPod case is now clean! Cleaning often is recommended as iPods, being used everyday, are exposed to the same microorganisms that live on your hand. You wash your hands dozens of times a day, why now wash your case?

 Let us use this website for example: http://www.symbols-n-emoticons.com/p/facebook-emoticons-list.html. Here you will find a list of emoticons and emojis that you can use.
 Note the code under the emoticon.


Standard Facebook emoticons will have symbols you can type on your keyboard. Non-standard emojis usually have a box below, which when you copy, a unique code will be copied onto your clipboard. This is the code unique to the emoji, and though it looks the same for all emojis on the surface, the selected emoji will still pop out in the chat you send.
 Do this by highlighting it with your mouse, right-clicking, and selecting “Copy.”

, When you hit “Send” or “Post,” the selected emoji or emoticon will appear.

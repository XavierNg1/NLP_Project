 Take two white chenille stems and cut them in half. Then coil each half-stem around a half-inch (1.25 cm) diameter marker. You will wrap the stem around the marker about five times to create an individual leg. Repeat this process with the remaining stem halves and then glue them onto a two-inch (5 cm) white pom-pom so that they resemble the four legs and body of a polar bear.You can find the stems and the pom-poms at your local crafts store.;
, Cut a chenille stem in half and twist it around the back of a one-inch (2.5 cm) white pom-pom. Coil the ends of the stem towards the pom-pom to create the bear’s ears., Apply some glue to the back of the head where you attached the ears. This will give you plenty of space to make your bear’s face. Then attach it to the front side of the body., Glue a half-inch (1.25 cm) sparkly white pom-pom to the front lower section of the bear’s head. Take a mini black pom-pom and glue it to the front end of the sparkly pom-pom to create a nose. Then glue two mini black pom-poms above the nose to create the bear’s eyes. Finally, attach a half-inch (1.25 cm) white pom-pom to the back of the bear’s body to create a tail.

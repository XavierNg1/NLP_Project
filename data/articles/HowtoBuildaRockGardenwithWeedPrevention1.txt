 Think about the specifics of your yard. Do you want your rock garden to be a small or large one, in sun or in shade? Most rock garden plants (such as Alpines) favor sun but you can adjust your planting scheme if you have a shady site. You may want to try sketching or drawing what you want your garden to look like. Rock gardens are fairly permanent structures, so avoid placing them in spots where there are manhole covers or underground pipes that may need to be accessed.

, Clear your site of plants, grass and anything else that might be there, like furniture or tree roots. It might help you to plan the area if you define the edges of your rock garden by digging a ‘map’ with your spade.
 You’ll need to have a think about drainage and how to improve it, if your soil does not drain well. A good way to increase soil drainage is to:


Remove a few inches of the topsoil. Mix in about six inches of gravel, rubble, broken bricks, pea shingle or coarse sand down. These materials will help your soil drain water more efficiently.
 If weeds are persistent in the area where you plan to have your rock garden, you can lay some horticultural weed-resistant fabric on the site.The fabric will allow water to penetrate but won’t allow weeds to grow through the fabric.
 If you don't want to use weed-resistant fabric, lay down several layers of old newspaper above the top layer of soil. The newspaper will eventually break down but will continue to keep the weeds at bay.


If you are worried about appearance, don’t worry—you will be laying a layer of topsoil and rocks down on top of the newspaper.

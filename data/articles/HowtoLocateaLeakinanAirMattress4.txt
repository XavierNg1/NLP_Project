 Some manufacturers recommend that you do not submerge their products.Submerging an air mattress puts it into contact with a lot of water. Fabric may become saturated.
Once an air mattress is saturated with water, seams may begin to deteriorate. Protective coating on synthetic fabrics may also begin to separate from the fabric.
 If it is not at least partially inflated, you you not be able to see air escaping under water.


Fully inflating the mattress may make it very difficult to submerge in a pool or bathtub.
 Apply pressure around the valve stem. See if you can force any air out of the valve.
Escaping air will cause a stream of bubbles to form around the leak. Look for these around the valve as you apply pressure.
Submerge parts of the fabric under the water. Look for bubbles, indicating escaping air from a leak.Do this in sections. Looking at a smaller area is easier than trying to find leaks in the whole mattress at one time.
Pay close attention to the areas around the seams. Seams are a common area for holes and tears to occur.
Mark the leak with a permanent marker once you find the source. Permanent marker is less likely to bleed on a wet surface. You can partially dry the area around the leak with a towel to aid in marking the leak.
Once the mattress is dry you can make your mark more clear by placing duct tape or a larger mark near the leak.
 The seams will take the longest to dry.If you don't dry a mattress before storing it, mold or mildew can form. It is important to make sure it is 100% dry before you put it away.
Before you can use any kind of adhesive patch to repair your mattress, it must be 100% dry.

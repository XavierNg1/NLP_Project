 Put 2 cups of flour, 1 tsp. of ground pepper, 1 tsp. of ground cumin, and 1/2 tsp. of salt in a large bowl. Though Urad flour is the most traditional flour used for making poppadoms, it can be a little difficult to find if you don't have any luck at your local Indian or Asian markets. If you can't find it, you can use garbanzo bean or chickpea flour instead., Use a wooden spoon to thoroughly stir the ingredients together until they are blended. Make sure that the garlic is fairly well distributed throughout the dough. Once you've stirred the dough for at least 30 seconds to a minute, make a little depression in the top of the dough for the water you'll add.
 Now, pour 1/4 cup (2 oz.) water into the little depression you've made.
 At first, you should use a wooden spoon to stir the ingredients together, if you wish. As the mixture gets a bit more formed, you can start using your hands. Alternately, you can just use your hands to incorporate the water right away.
 Now, just use your hands to knead the dough in the bowl until you've made a nice, substantive mixture that you can work with and all of the ingredients are incorporated. The water should help everything stick together.
 Use a roller to roll each piece back and forth until it is nice and thin. You should use a lightly floured, lightly oiled surface for best results, so that the poppadom pieces are easier to cook. Many poppadom recipes call for you to actually shape each piece into a circle, using either a shaper or an old CD or DVD to get the shape you're going for, though it doesn't really matter because the shape won't perfectly stay as it is.


You can also brush a bit of extra oil or ghee on each piece of dough to make it even easier to cook.
 This can add an extra spicy kick to your finished poppadoms later on. You can turn the poppadoms over and even sprinkle them with the spice on both sides if you really want to go for the full effect.

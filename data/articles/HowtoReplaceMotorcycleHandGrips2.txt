 The two grips that come in a package have slightly different-sized holes. The one that is slightly larger is meant to be installed on the side of the throttle, which is usually the right side. The smaller one should be installed on the side without the throttle.
 Apply a grip glue, such as E-6000, inside the hand grip opening and along the handlebar. The edge of one side of the grip is raised, while the other edge is not. Slide the grip onto the handlebar, raised edge first, before the glue begins to dry. Keep pushing until the raised edge of the grip is flush against the inside of the handlebar. When it's secure in place, squeeze the grip to help the glue set.









Don't use too much adhesive; apply just enough to hold the grip in place. If you use too much adhesive it will squeeze out the ends of the grip and make a mess.
Make sure to work quickly enough that the glue doesn't dry before you replace the grip. If it becomes hard to work with, use rubbing alcohol to remove the grip glue and start over.
If you don't have grip glue, try the hairspray method, advocated by many seasoned motorcyclists.
 Apply the glue to the grip meant for the throttle side as well as the handlebar. Quickly slide the grip onto the handlebar, raised edge first, until it is flush against the inside of the handlebar. Squeeze the grip to help the glue set.
 Screw the ends of the handlebars back on so that the grips are held firmly in place.
 Wait several hours for the glue to dry before using the motorcycle. When it's dry, test the grips to make sure you like them. If you find them to be uncomfortable, replace them using the same method.

 Also an excellent pose for an abdominal workout, the yoga bow pose requires effort to keep your legs bent and pulled back. Remember to look up as you complete this pose, to allow your chest to come completely off of your mat. The greater the lift, the more this pose stretches and strengthens your chest.
 As you complete this pose, focus on keeping your elbow against your knee. Push into your knee with your elbow to find your center of balance. For a slightly more challenging version of the triangle pose, try out the revolved triangle pose (which is also in yoga).

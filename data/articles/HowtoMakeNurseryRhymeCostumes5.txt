 You can also have your child dress up as Miss Muffet and find a fake spider and web to place on her shoulder.
 If possible place a tutu or petticoat underneath for extra effect.


Include tights, Mary Jane shoes and a little hat to create a fancy outfit.
 Dress the baby all in black, from a small beanie cap to a onesie that covers the arms, torso and legs.


Take 4 long black socks. They should be adult sized in order to mimic the length of your baby's arms and legs.
Take a piece of thin wire about as long as the sock and surround it with batting. You want to make sure there are no sharp edges. Stuff the batting into the socks, adding more as needed.
Sew the openings of the socks to the side of the onesie. Attach 2 socks to each side of the body. Bend the wire in the legs slightly forward, so it looks more like a bend in a spider's leg.

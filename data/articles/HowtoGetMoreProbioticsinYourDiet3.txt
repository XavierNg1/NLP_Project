 A prebiotic is a kind of soluble fiber which can be dissolved in water and is used by gut bacteria for fuel.Look for prebiotic supplements that contain inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), and galactooligosaccharides (GOS). These act as prebiotics, supporting the probiotics.You should also look for a “USP Verified” seal, which indicates that a non-profit lab, the USP, has checked the veracity of the contents and found that the bacteria or other ingredients listed on the label are actually in the bottle.
 Probiotic-containing supplements can be taken to increase the numbers of beneficial gut bacteria. Get a controlled-release form. You want a form of probiotic that allows the capsule or tablet to dissolve after it has passed through the stomach, which is what controlled-release does. Check the expiration date. Make sure the supplement contains at least 25 billion Colony Forming Units (CFUs).Make certain the probiotic contains many different strains of bacteria, but at least contains L. acidophilus, L. Fermentum, L, rhamnosus, B. longum, and B. bifidum.
Some products include a yeast, Saccharomyces, which functions very effectively to help protect the gut bacteria. This should be avoided if you have IBS, especially if you may have SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth).

 Place 1.5 tablespoons of white vinegar in a measuring cup.Buttermilk is actually a soured form of milk. You're achieving the same effect at home by adding acid to the milk. The acid curdles the milk slightly, thickening it. The acid is also what helps the baked goods to rise through a chemical reaction. When it mixes with baking soda (a base), the two of them together produce carbon dioxide, creating bubbles in your baked goods. This process achieves an airy texture.In place of the white vinegar, you can substitute lemon juice.You can also use other types of vinegar, but that can affect the flavor of your finished product.
You can double this recipe, but you'll need to use double the amount of vinegar or lemon juice, too.;
, Pour in the milk until it reaches the one cup mark."Scant" refers to "slightly less" in cooking, so a scant cup of milk is slightly less than a cup of milk.You can use 2 percent, whole milk, half-n-half, or cream., Mix up the milk and vinegar with a spoon., Let the mixture stand for at least 5 minutes. You may need to leave it for up to 15 minutes. You can leave it on the counter for this process., Make sure it has thickened slightly; it should lightly coat the back of a spoon. You should also see a few curdles in the milk. If you taste it, it should be lightly sour., In recipes for baked goods that call for buttermilk, use this mixture in a one-to-one ratio.

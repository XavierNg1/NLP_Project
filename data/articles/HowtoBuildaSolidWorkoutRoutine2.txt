 The routine posted above can be followed completely and is very effective or you can adapt it for your own use. The exercises however are very important; note how they all use multiple muscles because they have a greater range of motion.;
,, Try using each of the workouts above once a week.
 This is a simple piece of advice, antagonistic symmetry is when two muscles work in sync: like how you can straighten your arm, the triceps contracts and the bicep relaxes. Some people training one muscle too much and can damage themselves, the back is the most neglected muscle. The barbell row is pretty much the opposite of the bench press, so never bench more than you can row, this will avoid injury.

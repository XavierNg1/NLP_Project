 This is best as it helps to prevent the creation of lumps from the Nutella.

While you can throw all the ingredients in at once and blend, you risk some lumps forming.;
, Blend, then add in the other half and blend again., Stir through the mixture briefly., Little by little, slowly add in the milk until all of the ingredients are combined.

Add in a drop of vanilla essence (extract) if you want.
 Don't fill all the way though––it should be about a centimetre away from the very top. It shouldn't be full because as the mixture freezes, it will expand and pop over the top, making a mess., The longer you can leave it, the better, because if it hasn't completely frozen yet and you pull it out at the wrong time, it might fall apart., Pull them out of the molds. Do this slowly and gently.

If it doesn't come out, don't pull harder. Take a glass or bowl of hot water and dip the mold in there for a few seconds, then pull it out.
 Enjoy your creamy and sweet Nutella popsicles!

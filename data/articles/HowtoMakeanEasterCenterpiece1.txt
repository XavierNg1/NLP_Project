 Purchase baby carrots and cut the tops off them at roughly the same point on each one, so that only about an inch of green is left. Wash the carrots if needed but make sure they're dry before using. Insert as many of these carrots tip down into the glass vase until it is filled. Place in the center of the table.


If you make this on the morning of the day of your meal, these carrots can be refrigerated again in the evening, washed again and used for eating.;

 Catching your parents walking out the door, or otherwise in a hurry, is a bad way to get what you want. If you want them to take the time to hear you out, set a time to talk to them after dinner or on a weekend. Make sure that you discuss it somewhere that you and your parents feel comfortable, such as your living room.It might even help to say something like “Mom, Dad, I would like to talk to you about something. Can we make time after dinner tonight?”
An example of a bad time and place would be dropping by a parent’s office in the middle of the day to talk about your pet.Your parent will be busy with work and will not want to listen to you.
 If your parents are upset about something else, you should wait to bring up your pet. Most people are unable to totally exclude their day to day frustrations from an important discussion or decision. Try to help out around the house or relieve some stress from your parents, and bring up keeping your pet when they are calm and relaxed., This will set the tone for the whole conversation. Be direct and tell them exactly why you want to talk. Be sure that you do not tell them what to do.You might say something like “Mom, Dad, I would like to talk to you about keeping Wilson,” instead of “You guys have to keep my dog!”

 To give an SQ injection, a technique known as ‘tenting’ is used. If you are right handed, hold the syringe in your right hand (and vice versa if you are left-handed). Identify the injection triangle (as described in Method 1) and choose a spot in the center of this imaginary triangle. Using your left hand, pinch some of the animal's skin between your two forefingers and thumb and lift this piece of skin straight out and away from the neck to form a "tent". The tent should be made perpendicular to the neck. , The tip of the needle can be placed under your thumb, though location of where to place the tip of the needle depends on what you are most comfortable with and where you are least likely to poke yourself. Take care not to touch the plunger (if using a syringe) or trigger (if using a dosing device). , Using your forefinger of the hand holding the syringe, guide the needle into the center of one side the tent you formed with your other hand in the first preceding step. This ensures you only insert the needle halfway, instead of all the way, into the skin fold, and reduces the chance of hitting muscle or a blood vessel.
 Once the needle is in at the required length, release the skin and depress the plunger or squeeze the handle of the syringe with your syringe hand. Apply slow, steady pressure to the plunger. Once the injection is complete, withdraw the needle, cap it, and place the syringe on a dry, clean surface for future use (if you are planning on giving injections to more than one animal).
 Press and rub the injection site with your hand for a few seconds so that the spot does not bleed too much and to insure the injected fluid does not leak out too much. An SQ injection should not bleed nearly as much as an IM or IV injection, if at all, but there is greater risk of injected fluid leaking out, sometimes profusely if the skin is really tight or too much fluid is injected into one site.

 If you are dealing with a pile of bricks, you most likely will want to clean the entire brick. However, if you are working from a pre-constructed wall your approach may be a little different in terms of how you clean.


A brick wall can be sprayed and scrubbed depending on the level of build up or mess.






Individual bricks may be submerged in cleaning mixture for a deep down clean.;
, Aside from a new and strong scrub brush, you may want access to a few soft cloths and a toothbrush (for cleaning inside small cracks). Additionally, depending upon your approach, you will need a large bucket and/or empty spray bottle.
 Cleaning bricks is a messy job, no matter how neatly you approach the task. Place a drop cloth on the floor for protection and use work gloves to protect your hands from the rough brick edges. Also, a broom, dustpan and mop are always a good idea as brick debris may spray around the room during the cleaning process.

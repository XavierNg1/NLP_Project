 Place it on your stovetop, on medium high heat. Pour the rosemary into the pan and toast it until it is fragrant, about 30 seconds.Remove the rosemary from the heat to prevent it from burning and set it aside.
 Combine the oil, yeast, and warm water. Stir with a wooden spoon to dissolve the yeast.


Let the ingredients sit for about 5 minutes, until the mixture is foamy.
 Combine the flour and salt.
 Then, slowly pour the dissolved yeast mixture into the well. Work the flour with your fingertips.
 Use a few sprinkles of flour to prevent the dough from sticking to your fingers. Continue kneading for a few minutes until the dough turns into a ball.


Knead in the honey and the toasted rosemary.
 Place the dough in the greased bowl. Turn it over to coat it in the butter.
 Allow it to rise to 1 Â½ times its original size, for about 1 hour.
 Punch down the dough in the center of the ball with your fist. This will release any pent up CO2 in the dough. Plus it feels pretty satisfying to punch the dough!

, Transfer the dough on to the floured surface. Knead it for 5 minutes with the heel of your hands. Add more flour to prevent the dough from sticking to your fingers or the work surface, as necessary.
 Shape the dough into two loaves. Tuck in the corners so they are rounded.
 Cover them with oiled plastic wrap and let them rise for 20 minutes.
 Once the loaves have risen, place the pans in the oven. Bake them for about 25 to 30 minutes, until the tops are golden brown.
 Let them sit for five minutes to cool.


Take the loaves out of the pan once they have cooled. Slice up your Dabo bread and enjoy!

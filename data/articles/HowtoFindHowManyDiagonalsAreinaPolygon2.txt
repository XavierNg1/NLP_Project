 The formula to find the number of sides of a polygon is n(n-3)/2 where “n” equals the number of sides of the polygon.Using the distributive property this can be rewritten as (n2 - 3n)/2. You may see it either way, both equations are identical.


This equation can be used to find the number of diagonals of any polygon.
Note that the triangle is an exception to this rule. Due to the shape of the triangle, it does not have any diagonals., To use this formula, you must identify the number of sides that the polygon has. The number of sides is given in the name of the polygon, you just need to know what each name means. Here are some of common prefixes you will see in polygons:Tetra (4), penta (5), hexa (6), hepta (7), octa (8), ennea (9), deca (10), hendeca (11), dodeca (12), trideca (13), tetradeca (14), pentadeca (15), etc.
For very large sided polygons you may simply see it written “n-gon”, where “n” is the number of sides. For example, a 44-sided polygon would be written as 44-gon.
If you are given a picture of the polygon, you can simply count the number of sides.
 Once you know how many sides the polygon has, you just need to plug that number into the equation and solve. Everywhere you see “n” in the equation will be replaced with the number of sides of the polygon.For example: A dodecagon has 12 sides.
Write the equation: n(n-3)/2
Plug in the variable: (12(12 - 3))/2

, Finish by solving the equation using the proper order of operations. Start by solving the subtraction, then multiply, then divide. The final answer is the number of diagonals the polygon has.For example: (12(12 – 3))/2
Subtract: (12*9)/2
Multiply: (108)/2
Divide: 54
A dodecagon has 54 diagonals.
 The more practice you have with a math concept, the better you will be at using it. Doing lots of examples will also help you memorize the formula in case you need it for a quiz, test, or exam. Remember, this formula works for a polygon of any number of sides greater than 3.


Hexagon (6 sides): n(n-3)/2 = 6(6-3)/2 = 6*3/2 = 18/2 = 9 diagonals.
Decagon (10 sides): n(n-3)/2 = 10(10-3)/2 = 10*7/2 = 70/2 = 35 diagonals.
Icosagon (20 sides): n(n-3)/2 = 20(20-3)/2 = 20*17/2 = 340/2 = 170 diagonals.
96-gon (96 sides): 96(96-3)/2 = 96*93/2 = 8928/2 = 4464 diagonals.

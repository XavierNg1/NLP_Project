 Run the pads of your fingers over your tongue just enough to moisten them slightly. Most people prefer to use their thumb and forefinger, but any two fingers will suffice. The idea is to wet them just enough to stifle the candle with a light touch.Wetting your fingers will also help protect your skin from the heat of the flame.
If there’s a source of water nearby (like a sink or drinking glass), you can prepare your fingers that way, as well.
 In one rapid motion, grasp the wick between your two fingers. The moisture should cause the flame to die as soon as you make contact. Make sure you let go immediately so as not to take any chances.You may feel a warm sensation momentarily. Once the flame is out, however, the heat will dissipate almost instantly.
The sizzling sound you hear is nothing to worry about—it’s just the moisture on your fingertips evaporating.
 Needless to say, attempting to extinguish a candle wick with exposed fingers is risky, since it requires you to actually touch it. Always exercise the utmost caution anytime you bring any part of your body close to a burning candle. If the flame doesn’t go out, try again or give a different method a shot.

Practice a few times on an unlit candle (with dry fingers) before you try for real.
The inherent danger of using your fingers to put out a candle makes this more of a neat party trick than a practical everyday solution.

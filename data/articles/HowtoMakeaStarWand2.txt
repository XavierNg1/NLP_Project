 Draw two stars, one star slightly bigger than the other star.
, The pieces should be different colors but complementary or the same color but in differing shades.
 Cut around the shape twice.
 Cut around the shape twice.
 Then sew the other smaller star to the other larger star.
 The sides with the little star sewn on the outside should face outward. Leave a small gap for the stuffing.
 Stuff with batting, cotton wool or similar. Sew up the rest of the star.
 The wand stick can be made from any range of items, including a straw, a bamboo skewer, a specially cut piece of balsa wood, a thin dowel piece or even a garden twig (make sure it is clean)., See the ribbon ideas suggested above for the stick. The star shape can be left as it is or you can glue on an embellishment such as a heart shape or a name written in sequins.


If sewing on any decorative elements, do this before sewing the two stars together.

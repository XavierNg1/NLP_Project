 Resetting your BlackBerry device will delete everything on it, so make sure that you've saved any important data. Resetting your BlackBerry will also delete any IT policies that your BlackBerry may have received from your company's BlackBerry Enterprise Server, so check with our IT department if this is a company phone.

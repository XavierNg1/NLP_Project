 When trying to decide on a knitting needle size, it is best to begin by consulting the knitting pattern you are using. Knitting patterns will usually specify the size and type of needle required for a project. If multiple needle types and sizes are required, then these should all be listed on the pattern.


Always check before you get started and stick to the pattern’s recommendations to ensure that you get the best result possible.
 If you are not following a pattern, then the next best place to look for a needle size recommendation is on the label of your yarn. Most yarn labels include a size recommendation for knitting needles and crochet hooks. Check the label and look for a written or illustrated recommendation.Sometimes the labels will have written recommendation, such as “Knitting needles size 8,” while other times you will just see a pair of knitting needles with a number inside the illustration. This number is the size you need to get.
Keep in mind that there are American and European sizes. American knitting needle sizes are listed as whole numbers on labels, and European sizes are listed as a millimeter measurement, such as “9mm.”, Gauge is the number of stitches you knit per inch with a specific type of yarn and pair of needles.If you are not sure what size knitting needles to use, but you have a few pairs and some yarn, then you can always knit a gauge swatch to help you decide.


To knit a gauge swatch, knit a square that is four inches by four inches with your yarn and needles. Then, check the look of the stitches and see if this is the ideal needle size for your project, or if it might look better with a smaller or larger pair of needles.

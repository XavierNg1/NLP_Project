 After a cat starts to trust you, you will need to take the stray for a checkup with your veterinarian. Make an appointment with your veterinarian for as soon as possible.To take the cat to the veterinarian, place him in a cat carrier. This will help to keep the cat safe and secure.
Make sure that you inform the veterinarian that the cat is a stray. Also, tell the veterinarian if you’ve noticed any injuries, parasites, or any other health concerns.
The veterinarian will examine the cat and treat it for any internal or external parasites. The veterinarian will also perform a feline leukemia test by drawing a small amount of blood from the cat’s vein. If the test is negative, the veterinarian will administer some vaccines (rabies and distemper) and ask you to schedule the cat to be spayed and neutered.
If the cat has feline leukemia, you will be given some options. These may include surrendering the cat to a human society for care and adoption, keeping the cat yourself under feline leukemia precautions, or euthanasia. The veterinarian will help you decide which option is best for you.
 Helping stray cats is more than just providing them with some food.Stray cats need help finding homes so that they can lead the best life possible. Sometimes that home is with you; other times the best help you can give a stray cat is to find someone else who can provide for the cat.
 There are trap-neuter-release (TNR) organizations that will trap stray cats; take them to be neutered or spayed; and then release them back near where they were found. These programs help to keep the cat population under control and it is often a good option for cats that would not make good pets due to being too wild or feral.Your veterinarian, local humane society or animal control should be able to tell you if such organizations exist in your area and how to contact them.

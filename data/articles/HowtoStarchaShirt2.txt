 You can make your own starch mixture out of cornstarch and water. Mix 1 Â½ tablespoons of cornstarch with with 2 cups of water. Stir it until it looks milky. Pour the mixture into a bowl or into the sink. Add warm water until the sink or bowl is nearly filled.








You should have enough water in the bowl or sink so that the shirt can move freely. Not enough water can result in a board stiff shirt.
Use distilled water if you have hard tap water. If not, tap water should be fine to use.
 If the shirt is colored, turn it inside out. Then, immerse the shirt into the water. Work it through and then squeeze out the excess water. You should only immerse one shirt into the water at a time., You can also choose to starch the shirt in the washing machine rather than soaking it with your own hands. Allow the shirt to run through one regular wash cycle and then pause it as it reaches the final rinse through the drum. Then, pour the mixture into the fabric softener dispenser, or directly into the flow of water.








Do not pour the mixture in and allow it to sit in the dispenser throughout the entire washing cycle, or it may cause clogging.
 Put the shirt on a hanger and allow it to dry until it is damp. Once it is damp, remove it from the hanger. Iron it while it is still slightly damp. This will make the shirt crisp and wrinkle free.Make sure not to use too high of a heat setting if your shirt is made of a delicate fabric.

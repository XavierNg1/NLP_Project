 Work a r of 10 1 p separated by 2 D's. Tie and cut the thread.;
, The second row consists of 1 R's and chains alternating, the ring of 3 p separated by 2 D's and joined of the center. And of the chain of 4 D's, 5 p separated by 2 D's, 4 D's. T

, The third row consists of 10 R's, the same as in this row, joined to the middle p of the ch and chs contain 9 p instead of 5.
 **r 5 p separated by 2 D's, * ch 5 p separated by 2 D's, r like last, repeat from * 8 times, joining the R's by the 2d p. After making the 10th r, make a chain of 9 p, joining it by the middle p to the chain of the previous row. Repeat from ** 9 times, joining the wheels by the P's of 3 chains as seen in the illustration. Fill in the spaces at the outer edge by c L's, each r of 6 D's, 5 p separated by 3 D's, 6 D's.
 It consists of 11 wheels like the one in the center of the crown, joined to each other and to chains of the previous row. These wheels reach to the neck, and the rest of the row at the neck is of 2 half wheels same as these. A half wheel is also made each side of the front at the neck to make the lower edge wide enough. Fill in spaces with c L's.
 This is the row across the front. Make a double row of R's, each of 7 D's, 5 p separated by 3 D's, joined at first p, and one side joined to work previously done.
 Make another row of 11 wheels, same as in center of crown with 8 chains instead of 10 and fill in the spaces with c L's or large R's.
 This extends all the way around the cap. The outer r is the same as in the previous row, and is joined by the first p. The inner r is of 4 p, not joined to each other. Make the R's close enough to make the work lie flat.
 Sew on the bow and the ties as shown in the illustration.

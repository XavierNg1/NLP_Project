 If you've just spilled some butter or your boots or gotten bacon grease on the couch, it's best to leap into action right away. If you catch it quick enough, all you need to clean your leather item is:

A microfiber cloth
Talcum powder;
, Gently blot at the grease stain, trying to absorb as much of it as possible as quickly as possible. The trouble with cleaning leather is that it tends to absorb liquid, especially grease, making it difficult to clean topically once it's been absorbed.









Avoid scrubbing the leather. This can damage the fine grains of the leather, making the stain worse. Blot gently and use some kind of lint-free microfiber cloth.
 Just like wood, leather has a direction of texture. You'll have more success in applying any cleaner if you apply it along the lie, as opposed to across it. In other words, any time you wipe or blot at the leather, you want to do it with the grain.









If you're having trouble finding the grain, try to work from the "outside" of the stain in to the center. At the very least, you'll be able to shrink the stain this way., Use regular household baby powder to soak up the grease. Be liberal with your application of the powder. It works particularly well at drawing the grease out without damaging the leather because it's more absorbent than the leather is, as long as you get there in time.









Let the powder sit overnight, or at least several hours to do its work.
 Using a cloth, gently brush off the talcum powder. Be careful not to scrub the powder back into the leather, working the grease back out.

 In person, it is best to keep things respectful but casual. Call your Protestant pastor “Pastor” and then their last name.For example, you could call a pastor named Jill Shannon “Pastor Shannon.”
Some congregations are more familial and casual than others. If this seems like it applies to your situation, you might try calling your pastor “Pastor” and their first name (For example, “Pastor Jill”) or even simply “Pastor.” You can ask your pastor what they like best.
 Call the priest “Father” and then their last name in casual settings such as after mass. This is an informal greeting that still respects the priest’s authority.For example, you would address a priest named Don Everton as “Father Everton.”
Some parishes like to keep things very casual, in which case the priest may simply go by “Father” and his first name (for example, “Father Don”) or even simply “Father.” You can ask your priest what he prefers to be called to avoid any confusion.
 Address the spouse of the pastor as Mr., Mrs., Ms., or Dr. and their last name, whichever is most appropriate. This keeps things personal but respectful, particularly if you don’t know them well.


For example, you might call a pastor’s husband, “Dr. Johnson,” if he is a dentist. Similarly, you might call a pastor’s wife who does not share his last name, “Ms. Wells.”
If the congregation is one that uses the term “First Lady” outlined in part one, use the title with only her last name. Pastor Michael Jones’s wife Donna would be addressed, “First Lady Jones.”

, It is most important to show the pastor respect as a valued community member, which means calling them whatever they prefer to be called. If your pastor requests that you call them by their first name, feel free to do so. It is then acceptable to apply the same rule to their spouse, as they have indicated the level of formality they prefer.

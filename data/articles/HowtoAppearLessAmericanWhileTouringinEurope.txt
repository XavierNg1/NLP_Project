 Are they wearing sneakers? Boots? Heels/dress shoes? Take a look around and notice trends. Most Europeans do not wear sneakers, so wear boots, flats, or anything that suits your fancy. Make sure that they are comfortable as well.;
, Get one that's not too bulky, but warm. A lot of European countries get a considerable amount of rain and some are very cold. Make sure your jacket keeps you warm and dry.
 Don't wear shirts with American brands or slogans on them. "American Eagle", "Hollister", or "Abercrombie & Fitch" are probably not a good idea.
 Speak quietly and don't draw attention to yourself. Don't behave like a tourist, and be polite and courteous. You probably won't fool people thinking that you're European for long, but you can leave them with a good impression of yourself.
 Even if they do, they might not answer. Remember that those who do would still greatly appreciate a word or two in their native tongue. If they have great vocabulary and pronunciation, tell them. They'll appreciate it and treat you better.
 Attempting to speak the language is showing respect towards the nation and its people. Good words or phrases to know include are "hello", "please", "goodbye", "do you have...?", and "do you speak English?"

, Examples include: shirts with American flag on it, "I Love NY" shirts, shorts with anything written on the butt, etc. At the same time, don't pretend to be of a different nationality; it might get you in trouble and put you in the position where you either have to lie or make a strange excuse.
 You don't have to sport all the latest trends, but try to put effort into your appearance. Clothing articles like hoodies and sweatpants probably won't make you very European looking, so try to stay away from the outdated and sloppy look.
 In America a 'notice me' approach to public volume is acceptable, but in Europe, your accent and loud talk will be unappreciated. You don't have to whisper, but try to act civilized and polite.

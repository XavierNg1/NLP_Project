 If you see that a group of girls are out together, it’s important that you recognize all of them and treat them equally. Even if you only like one girl in the group, ignoring or dismissing her friends will often make them angry at you or make you seem like a jerk.


It's okay to change who you target if you meet someone more interesting or attractive that's in the group. Just make sure that you aren't sending signals to more than one girl or problems may arise.
Some good opening lines include, “Hey girls, how’s everything going tonight?" or "Are you all having fun?”
Another good way to open, is to ask them their opinions on a relevant topic that you have debated with a friend.Examples include “Me and my friend were debating over whether the new Kanye album was as good as his old stuff. What do you girls think?" or "My buddy thinks that vodka is the best liquor, but I think whiskey is. What do you girls think?”
Shaking hands is a good way to make physical contact with new girls that you meet, but some may even be receptive to hugging. If they go for the hug, reciprocate it.
 If you can make a good impression on her friends, it will make you look a lot better to the girl that you have your eyes on. Also, in some circles it is considered tacky to buy one girl a drink but then ignore her friends.If you don’t have enough money to buy everyone drinks, you can offer to buy them songs on the jukebox.
Refrain from being mean to any of her friends.
 As much as you want to engage her friends and keep them happy, you also don’t want her to start thinking you’re not interested in her. Try to go out of your way to pay her special attention, but never do it in an aggressive way.


When you are talking to her friends, make sure to compliment her, specifically, in a non-sexual way.
If there is a lull in the conversation, or people break off into individual groups, take your chance to speak with her one on one.

 If your air is a steady line with just the right amount of air volume, your singing will float along with the very best physics possible for the vibration of the vocal folds. Higher notes need a faster flow of air, but it is not a frantic, tension-filled increase, just a stretch into more connection.
, Getting the body used to singing the end well with plenty of breath and without closing down or tension trains its muscle memory to find a good approach to this spot. Practicing it this way often before connecting the parts sets you up for success. But also, consider whether it's the better part of valor (wisdom) find a spot to breathe somewhere in it. No one will notice where you breathe if you make the breath part of the expression of the piece, make it as much a part of the music as the sung notes. But everyone will notice if you creak or turn blue on the last note.
, Your singing all rides on this constant line. Depending on the style or range of the notes, you may have a silvery thin line or a thick line like a decorative fountain spurting up many columns. Learn to picture that steady line of air in your practice, and it will come naturally during performance.
 Think a body stretch through the breath, and it will leave you ready for the phrase, not disengaged.

 For example, know that "Possible Suspects" in the notebook will ask the person in question if they know of any possible suspects.

, Note their reply when the conversation is started. You will now know how they answer their questions. They should use the same "method" for the real question.
 If they hesitate, avoid your gaze, or fidget, you will know that they are lying, as most people will feel uneasy about telling a lie.
 For example, if there is a stolen purse valued at $100, and the suspect says $50, you know that the suspect is telling a lie.
 If you have evidence to prove that the person is lying, press the "Lie" button. If there is no evidence, press the "Doubt" button.

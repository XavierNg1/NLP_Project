 The first encounter with her was in her cabin, right before entering the Residence. The second time was in the tunnels. The third time (now) will be right before entering the lab.;
, The ladder down is kind of hidden in the shadows and bumps of Jessica Trevor's shrine, in the room of the Main Hall 1F of the mansion, down the steps and through the double doors unlocked by both the Stone & Metal Objects.
 Lisa then enters the area, smashing one of the statues.


If as Jill, Barry will go crazy and point his gun at you. As soon as Lisa enters, you will be faced with a decision to give him back his gun or not.
If you give it back (recommended for a better ending), he can survive the battle and help you out.
If you don't give it back, he automatically gets knocked off the edge by her and drops a family picture and you get to keep his .44 Magnum.
 There are two ways of doing this;


Push down all four pillars to uncover the tomb and make her scream when she sees it and jump off the edge. She will mainly focus on your partner because he is the one shooting her. If she is about to kill your partner, shoot her to divert her attention. Also be careful not to let her push you off or hit you.
Shoot her until she falls off. Shoot her until she gets to the edge, where she will almost fall off but holds on. Run right over to her, aim down with your gun and fire again. That should make her lose her grip and fall off. Using the Infinite Rocket Launcher if you unlocked it by completing Normal or Hard mode in under 3 hours, you can get her close to the edge and then shoot, and she will be knocked down and will just fall off the edge without holding on.

 Close your blinds before you take them down to make it easier. If you have several sets that you will be cleaning on the same day, label them lightly on the bottom with a pencil. Wipe off the pencil after you’ve hung them back up.


Don’t ever soak cloth or wooden blinds.
 Fill the tub until there are about six inches (15.24 cm) of water covering the bottom. Add three to six drops of liquid dish soap. You can also add about one cup (240 mL) of vinegar if your blinds are really dirty.
 Add 3-4 tablespoons (44.36-59.14 mL) of bleach to the hot water in your tub. Don’t add dish soap or vinegar. Wear gloves when working with bleach and keep children and pets safely away from the tub., Swish the water around your blinds to agitate the soap and water. Use a soft brush, sponge, or rag to rub down the blinds if they are especially dirty. Let them soak for about an hour. After an hour, drain the tub and thoroughly rinse all soap from your blinds.This will work with faux wood and metal blinds.
 After rinsing the blinds, give them a gentle shake to remove extra water. Lay them on clean towels and pat them dry. Next, carefully hang them back up and let them thoroughly air dry while they are open.


Repeat the soaking and drying methods for all sets of blinds you need to clean.

 Most spiders don’t do well in homes because they don’t have enough to eat and there is not enough moisture. If you have a door or window in the room that the spider is in, try leaving the door or window open for a while to see if the spider will find its own way out. If you can't stand to look at the spider, just leave the door/window open and leave the room for a few hours.


By the time you come back, the spider will probably have found its way out.
 This is probably the most common method of getting a spider out of your home without killing it. All you have to do is place something over the top of the spider. Slide a piece of thin cardboard between the lid and the floor (or wall) and then take the spider outside and let it go.A big drinking glass works well.
Make sure that the cardboard is not too flimsy. You want the cardboard to be strong enough that you can keep it pressed directly against the lip of the glass.
 If the spider is already near an open window or door, you might be able to direct the spider out. If you are too afraid to get near it, try using something with a long handle (a broom works well) to gently nudge the spider in the direction of the door.Do this subtly. If you are too aggressive you will probably scare the spider. This might make the spider run frantically (and if you’re unlucky, in the wrong direction — toward you!) to get away from the broom.

 To start, take a 6-quart electric slow cooker. Add the cranberry juice and the honey. Mix them together until the honey is dissolved., Lay out two pieces of cheesecloth on top of one another. Place your allspice, cloves, and cinnamon sticks on the cloth.Using all four corners, tie the two pieces of cloth into a satchel.
Tie your satchel tight so nothing escapes during the cooking process.
 Gently lower your satchel into the cranberry mixture in the slow cooker. Let it go and allow it to float in the mixture., Place your lemon rinds and vanilla bean in the cranberry juice mixture. Cover the slow cooker. Turn to the low setting. Allow it to cook for 5 hours., After five hours have passed, remove the cheesecloth and discard the ingredients in it. You should also remove and discard the citrus rinds.Use utensils, like tongs, during this process to avoid burning your fingers.
 Add the rum to the mixture. Stir a few times. You can serve this drink directly from the slow cooker. You can also pour it into a pitcher.

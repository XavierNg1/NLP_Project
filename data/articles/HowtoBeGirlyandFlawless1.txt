 Wear bright pastels such as pink, mint green, lavender etc. Wearing dark clothing is okay once in a while but you should try to avoid it. Try to look approachable! Show off that big bright smile!;
, If you only have a little bit of the colorful clothes, then pick your favorites from the dark colors!

, Organize what you are going to wear the next day so you're always prepared and never disorganized! Wear clothing that is both stylish and appropriate for the weather:

During winter, you can wear a warm sweater or turtleneck with a pair of jeans or leggings with a pair of boots etc.
During spring, you can wear a sweater with a pair of leggings and a skirt, a spring dress or a girly tee etc.
During summer, you can wear a romper, dress, shorts, crop-tops, overalls etc.
During fall, you can wear long sleeves, overalls, sweaters, jeans, hoodies leggings etc.
 Think about why you want to be girly if you want to be girly to fit in then being girly is not for you.

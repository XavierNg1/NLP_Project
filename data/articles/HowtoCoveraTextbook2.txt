 The go-to material is the thick, brown paper called Kraft paper. This is what paper bags like the kind you might get at the supermarket is made from. Kraft paper is available on rolls anywhere shipping supplies are sold, and it is a little easier to work with. However, obviously that paper is not free.


Make sure your bag is large enough to cover both sides of your book before beginning.
 Start by cutting out the bottom of the bag along its folds and removing any handles if your bag has them. Make a single vertical cut along one of the bag's corners. Your bag should now look like a single, rectangular sheet of paper.
 Now that you have more or less turned your paper bag into a single sheet of paper, the rest of the process is easy. Just follow the steps in the section above, using your cut-up paper bag in place of the sheet of paper specified.


Ignore the folds that may remain in the sheet of paper you have cut from your paper bag â€” make your own folds.
Ironing the paper on medium heat on an iron can get rid of any fold marks that may confuse you, or just make a really nice, tidy piece of paper.

 Starting from Riften’s marketplace, cross the bridge on the east side and you should find the Riftweald Manor just a little to the left of the foot of the bridge. Riftweald Manor is Mercer Frey’s house.;
, There’s a small steel gate at the front of the manor. Approach the gate and press the assigned “Unlock” button on your game controller (as displayed on the game screen) to pick the locks and get into the courtyard.
 Go through the tunnel and pass a wooden staircase to get to the courtyard. There’s another small gate here. Approach the gate and press the “Unlock” button again to pick the locks and get through it.
 Take the path on the right side of the courtyard gate to get around and reach the back side of the manor where there’s a small stone staircase a little to the left. Look up the side of the manor to see a small wooden balcony.
 A pointer can be seen on the underside of the wooden balcony, indicating a target point. Take out your bow and arrow, and shoot at the target to bring down a wooden ramp.
 Once the ramp is down, climb the stone staircase on the left side to reach the bottom of the ramp. Climb the wooden ramp to get inside the manor.


There you go! You’ve just infiltrated Mercer Frey’s house!

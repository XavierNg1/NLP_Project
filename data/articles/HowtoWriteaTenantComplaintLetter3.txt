 Generally, landlords are legally responsible for correcting dangerous conditions in your rental space or the apartment building. Dangerous conditions may include:


Structural problems, such as damaged walls or roof.
Failing to provide working locks on windows and doors.
Failing to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.
Unsafe or unsanitary stairways.
Damaged electrical or plumbing services.
Failing to rectify rodent or pest infestations.
Failing to evict drug sellers living in the building., Your landlord may not be aware of the dangerous condition on the property and therefore you must send the landlord a letter notifying him or her of the condition. Your letter should include:


A detailed description of the hazard.
If you previously notified the landlord of the condition, state when you gave prior notice.
State that you have serious concerns for your personal safety.
Describe the potential and foreseeable harm that could occur, such as fire or burglary.
If you are concerned about a lack of security precautions such as workable locks or a gate over a window leading to a fire escape, you can note (if applicable) recent incidents of crime in your area.
Request that that the situation be rectified immediately.
Sign and date your letter.
Send your letter via certified mail and keep a copy for your records.You can view a sample notice letter at: http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/sample-letter-alerting-landlord-dangerous-conditions.html.
 If your landlord fails to make the necessary repairs, you should take steps to minimize the potential harm. This can include:


Having the problem fixed and deducting the cost from your rent.

Breaking your lease.

Withholding rent.
You should review your stateâ€™s laws in order to act in accordance with any legal requirements. However, your first concern should be your personal safety.

 This variation works especially well if you need to play inside and can't run or risk damaging anything. Rather than chasing people, the person who is "It" merely needs to find them. Once found, a player assists the Infected person in finding other players. Last player found wins!

, In this variation, the original Infected is allowed to run as they normally would, but tagged players can only walk like a zombie, and must make zombie noises and moans when chasing other players.


This variation removes the need to ask other players if they are also infected - they'll be moaning and shuffling like a zombie!
This can also add an interesting element of strategy. Since zombie players can't move quickly, they need to work together to trap other players.
 This works well in really big houses and buildings as well, where running would be frowned upon. Since you shouldn't be running indoors, players are limited to walking when chasing and attempting to escape each other.


When walking, at least one foot must always be on the ground.
 This variation is more complicated in that it requires everyone to have a stopwatch or phone with a stopwatch app, but it can be a lot of fun. When tagged, players are infected for a set amount of time (usually 3 or 5 minutes). If this time elapses without everyone being caught, players are "cured" once their timer is up, and need to be tagged once more!

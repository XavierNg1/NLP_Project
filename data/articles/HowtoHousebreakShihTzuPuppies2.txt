 Rewarding your puppy with exaggerated praise and food treats will help it form a positive association with correct bathroom behavior. You must offer rewards immediately when it starts to go to the bathroom so it makes the connection between the reward and going to the bathroom.Keep tiny pieces of a treat less than the size of a pea on hand when you take your puppy out to potty. If you wait to treat it when you’re back inside, it won’t understand that the reward was for going to the bathroom correctly.
 As your puppy starts getting used to pottying in the appropriate area, start to incorporate a “Go potty!” command. Say the command when you arrive at the potty spot, and be sure to reward it when it potties. Over time, your puppy will associate the command with pottying and being rewarded.A “Go Potty” command will help you get your dog to use the bathroom in unfamiliar locations in the future.
Other than giving a verbal potty command, avoid unnecessary distractions, like games or talking., You should keep a close eye on your pup when it’s indoors during potty training until it’s gone four to eight weeks without an accident. That way, you’ll have the best chance of interrupting an accident the moment it happens.Keeping your puppy in a particular area instead of allowing it to access your entire home will help you keep an eye on it. When it’s not in its crate, keep doors closed or try using sturdy baby gates keep areas off limits.

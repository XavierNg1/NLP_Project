 Ducks tend to be healthy pets and have relatively few medical problems. However, ducks may contract various forms of internal (intestinal) and external worms. On average, domestic ducks need to go through a de-worming procedure once every 6 months.Speak with your veterinarian, and ask if they recommend a specific product that you can use at home.


Regular swimming can help keep ducks healthy by allowing them to wash mites and other intestinal worms out of their feathers. If your ducks do not have access to adequate water, they will be more likely to contract mites or worms.
 Ducks’ feet are sensitive and tender, and can be damaged from walking on rough surfaces. Look at your ducks’ feet every couple of weeks—if you notice any “ulcers” (which cause sores, swelling, or limping), take your duck to the veterinarian.To help protect your ducks’ feet, cover the floor of their shed with a generous layer of straw or rice hulls. Avoid letting your ducks walk on bare concrete or cement.
 Ducks tend to be clumsy animals, and can easily damage their wings by running or flying into an immovable object in their environment. Regularly look for any ducks that seem to be favoring one wing, or that have a wing sticking away from their body at an odd angle. If you find that a duck has injured or broken a wing, take the animal to the vet immediately.Juvenile ducklings can easily damage their wings while learning to fly, since juveniles are unsteady and inexperienced flyers.

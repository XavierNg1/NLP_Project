 You normally cannot trade Pokémon between the two Generations of games. You can transfer small batches of Pokémon at a time from your Generation IV game to your Generation V game (but not vice versa). This is a one-way process, and the Pokémon will be erased from your Generation IV game after being transferred.You'll need two DS systems in order to make this transfer.
 Any items that are being held by Pokémon will be lost when they are transferred, so make sure you remove any items that you want to keep.
 In order to transfer your old Pokémon to your Generation V game, you'll need to have beaten the game first and collected all of the Gym Badges. This is to prevent you from getting an unfair advantage by importing a bunch of leveled-up Pokémon.
 You can find this facility in the same spot regardless of what Generation V game you're playing.


When you go to the Lab for the first time, you'll be taken through several conversations.
 You will then be instructed to continue the process on the second DS system

, This will be on the main menu of the second DS, before you start the game.
 It may take a few moments to download.
 You can select nearly any of your Pokémon from your PC in the Generation IV game. You cannot select any Pokémon that has learned a Hidden Move, but you can use the Move Deleter function to let the Pokémon forget it. You also can't transfer any Pokémon from your active Generation IV party, so move them to your PC first.
 Tap and drag the crossbow back to aim and set the power. Release it to send a Poke Ball flying into the top screen. If it hits a Pokémon, you'll capture it.


If a Pokémon is hiding behind a bush, hit the bush to make it start hopping.
You only have a certain amount of time to complete this, but you can do this as many times as you'd like.
 Once the game ends, you'll be asked to confirm the transfer. Remember, this is a one-way move, so make sure you want to proceed.

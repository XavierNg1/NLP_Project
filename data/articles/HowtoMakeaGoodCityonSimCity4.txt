 If you have a rough terrain, this may be more difficult. If you intend on building on large city, mostly flat or completely flat land is suggested. You can edit the terrain in God mode if it is rough.;
, Building the power-plants in the middle of the city is a good move, because you can evenly distribute the power. You can also use utility lines if necessary.
 You do it by road, highway, train, any way you want, as long as Sims are able to commute between areas. If a zone isn't connected, your zones won't be of much use.
 That means it's time to build important buildings, like Fire and Police Departments, Hospitals and Schools, and anything else that will benefit your city.
 (Note: Landfills can really decrease the beauty of your city and are expensive. If desired, use recycling plants instead.)

, Your budget. Maintaining a balanced budget us key to keeping your city afloat.
 Try giving across the board tax cuts to make all Sims happy. Make sure to keep commercial taxes lower than the industrial and the residential tax. My current tax rate for the middle class home is 6.1% and middle class businesses are 5.9%. But industrial are averaging 6.9% - 7.2%. This allows more spending and creating jobs, helping the budget. I cut funding in half for education, and about 30% to hospitals. Roads spending should NEVER be cut! Never raise taxes just to increase the surplus.

 It is important that you select a bed that fits the size of your cat. Use a tape measure and measure your cat from its head to the base of its tail. Then add a few inches. Then select a bed that fits this measurement. This will ensure that the bed is cozy, but not too cramped., Cup-style cat beds are typically circular in shape and have side walls to give your cat added comfort. This style of bed is perfect for a cat who enjoys to sleep curled up in a ball., Some cats prefer to sleep in sheltered areas. For example, your cat may spend most of the day hidden under furniture. In this case, you should try a cave-style bed. These beds will provide some covering so that your cat can sleep inside a den-like structure., Some cat beds will have high sides in order to provide your cat with added comfort. If you have a kitten or an older cat with mobility issues, you want to make sure that your cat can easily enter and exit the bed. Purchase a bed with one low side so that your cat can enter without difficulty.

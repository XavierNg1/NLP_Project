 Once you’ve consumed all your available lives, exit and close the game.
 From your mobile device, look for the Settings, and launch it.
 Navigate through all the settings and look for the Date and Time menu.
 Change the clock to something at least three hours later. Doing so tricks the game into thinking that enough time has passed and you’re now supposed to have your full set of lives replenished.
 Look for the game again and open it. You should now have a full set of lives.
 Once you’ve gotten your lives, don’t forget to re-adjust your clock to the correct time.

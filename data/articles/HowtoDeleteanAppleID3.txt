 If you've switched from an iPhone to an Android or other smartphone, you may not be receiving text messages that are still being sent to your Apple ID. You can de-register iMessage by visiting selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage.
 Enter the mobile number that is not properly receiving messages. You'll receive a text message from Apple with a code.
 Entering this code will verify that you own the phone number, and your iMessage account will be de-registered. You should receive all of your SMS messages as normal.

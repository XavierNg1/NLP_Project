 In many cases, your cat will be able to overcome a fever on its own, but it is always a good idea to consult your vet. If your cat is sick for several days or you suspect a chronic condition, it is even more important that you visit your vet., In addition to telling the vet that your cat has had a fever, be sure to tell your vet any other symptoms that your cat has exhibited. This is important information that your vet can use to determine a diagnosis.
 Depending on the vetâ€™s diagnosis, you may simply need to keep your cat hydrated and comfortable. If your vet suspects infection or something else, you might have to administer medicine.

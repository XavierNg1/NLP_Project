 Breathing is the simplest and most effective warm-up. Plant your feet firmly on the ground, and squarely beneath your shoulders. Breath in through your nose and count to three. Now exhale through your mouth and count to three. Keep doing this until you feel completely relaxed.


If you're going to be on a stage, you should practice projecting. Breath in, and make sure your shoulders don't go up. Then talk as loud as you can without screaming. It might help by putting your hand near your stomach, and feeling what's happening. You might notice that only your stomach's going out. That's good, it means you're using your diaphragm.
 It might seem funny, but it's good to clear your thoughts.

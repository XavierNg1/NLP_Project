 The oil our faces naturally produce is called sebum. It's a beneficial oil that protects our skin and keeps it flexible and healthy. Washing it away too frequently results in your pores producing more oil to make up for what was lost. This overproduction is what leads to the appearance of oily skin. To prevent this from happening:


Wash your face (with oil) just once a day. If you need to remove oil in between washings, use blotting paper instead of washing your face.
Moisturize your face after washing it. If your face gets too dry, your pores will produce oil to make up for it.
It may take a few days of using this new routine for your face to balance out.
 Wash your face every night before going to bed. It's important to remove makeup and the dust from the day before you go to sleep at night, so that your pores don't get clogged. There's no need to wash it again in the morning.
 Using soaps and facial cleansers in an attempt to get rid of your face's oil will cause your pores to produce extra to make up for it. Wean yourself off of your soap-based facial cleansers, especially those containing harsh cleaning agents like sodium laurel sulfate.


It's better to wash your face with plain water than to use a facial cleanser. Use the oil cleansing method when your face needs a deep cleansing.
If you're worried about acne, use tea tree oil and other natural methods instead of resorting to harsh cleansers, which tend to irritate acne more.
 Choosing your makeup wisely is a big part of oil control. Caking on the makeup isn't going to solve the problem, so use it sparingly. Go for matte foundation and mineral powders to help absorb the oil and keep your face from looking shiny.

 If it's too warm or cold, you won't be able to create the stiff, glossy peaks you need to make a good meringue.
 One little splatter of yolk will prevent you from achieving good volume and high peaks. The heavy yolk changes the composition of the mixture, as do bits of shell.


If you drop some yolk or shell into the meringue, it's best to start over rather than trying to fish it out.
You can avoid getting shell in the whites by cracking the eggs over a bowl different from the one you use to mix up the meringue, then transferring the whites carefully to the mixing bowl.
 Make sure the mixing bowl you start with is completely clean and dry. During the mixing process, avoid getting even the merest drop of water in the bowl, as it throws off the composition of the meringue and ruins the dish.
 To achieve stiff, glossy peaks, you need to add the sugar slowly to give it time to mix in thoroughly and evenly.

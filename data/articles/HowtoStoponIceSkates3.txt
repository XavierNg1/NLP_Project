 As you build confidence and skill, you can learn to stop harder, at greater speeds. This is the technique that ice hockey players and other professional ice skaters use. It becomes necessary, at some point, as you need to stop quickly and efficiently in order to keep up with the competition. If you're a beginner, however, you don't need to worry about mastering this right away., You can be gliding more quickly than you would for the "snowplow stop," but you should still feel as though you are in control. In certain high-performance situations—an intense hockey game, or a complex figure-skating move—you may need to come to a halt or change directions very quickly. In general, avoid trying to suddenly stop while flying across the rink at your top speed., As you glide, go into a half-crouch, as though you're going to sit. Make sure to keep your knees shoulder-width apart. This is called un-weighting yourself. Then, turn your skates sideways not-quite-90 degrees from the direction that you were going before.
 With your knees bent, lean away from the direction you are heading. Focus your weight on the side of your feet that is away from the direction that you are moving.
 Slowly but firmly dig the edge of your skates into the ice. Hold fast, and dig harder as you slow down. Ride the friction until you come to a halt.Only a small portion of the skates should be in contact with the ice, thus minimizing friction and eventually allowing you to stop on a dime.

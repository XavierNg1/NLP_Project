 Soak the apple slices in Bergamot juice and set aside. Get a skillet hot, coat it with a tablespoon of olive oil, and cook the mushrooms for about five minutes. Season them with salt and pepper, then remove them from heat.Whisk together the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and vinegar. Toss the greens, mushrooms, and apples and coat them with the oil and vinegar. Serve immediately with slices of fresh, warm baguette.
 Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius). Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, and salt. In another bowl, beat together the butter and sugar until the mixture is fluffy and creamy, then mix in the zest, juice, and vanilla. Combine the wet and dry ingredients until the dough comes together, then roll the dough into a log and slice it into cookies.Place the cookies onto a cooking sheet and bake for 16 to 18 minutes. Their tops should still be pale, but the bottoms should be slightly browned.
 Separate the seeds from the pulp, wrap the seeds securely in cheesecloth, and puree the pulp. Combine the fruit puree, juice, water, and cheesecloth-wrapped seeds in a large saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 20 minutes.Remove from heat and let the mixture rest for about two hours.
Add the sugar to the fruit mixture, bring it to a boil again, then simmer for another 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
When finished, ladle the marmalade into sterilized jars.

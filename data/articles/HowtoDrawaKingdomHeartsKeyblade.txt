 If you aren't drawing an official Keyblade, then pick a Disney movie (or something else) to model it after.
, If you are making a Keyblade up, the handle can be any shape, but it looks the best if it is an oval with a line in the middle. Draw an oval, a line going through the middle, then another oval (slightly larger) outside of the first one. When you color it in, you can add cool designs to the handle., If you just want it to be simple, it's just 2 narrow lines. If not, outside of the 2 thin lines, there would be 2 more lines much wider apart. This gives room for decorative design. The 2 narrow lines will be colored in, but in the wider lines, you can do designs, patterns, or ribbon strips going off the sides. Get creative!, It can be 2 spikes, 3 spikes, or an intricate design that you make up yourself. As long as it looks sharp, it looks good., Draw some ovals coming off of the handle, then a single shape that has to do with what you are basing it off of., Now come up with a name that has something to do with whatever it is based on.

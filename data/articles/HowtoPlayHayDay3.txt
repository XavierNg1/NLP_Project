 You'll need coins in order to purchase different crops, animals, and equipment throughout the game. Constantly planting and harvesting crops will allow you to get a steady stream of coins. Click on the roadside shop to sell items to other users of the game. The game will automatically set a price for the goods, but you can change the values with the up and down arrows. Grow crops that take a long time while you're working or going to class and grow faster-growing crops when you are actually playing the game., Often the missions in Hay Day's bulletin board will have orders that take too long or aren't worth their investment in coins. Do not take these quests. Don't be afraid to say no to an order if it doesn't make you money., Special events will occur throughout the game, and you'll have an opportunity to play them. These events include things like the Visitor Bonus Event, which will give you twice the amount of coins than usual. Other events like The Special Halloween event will also give you more coins and the chance to get diamonds., Every once and a while your newspaper will have a deal for more than one item, like a stack of 5 pickaxes. In this case, you can buy in bulk then resell each of the tools individually. Doing this can make you more coins over time.

 Turkey drumsticks require almost an hour on the grill, and it's important to maintain a steady heat of about 300 degrees Fahrenheit so they don't burn or end up undercooked.
 Sprinkle the meat all over with salt and pepper. If you want to add spices and other seasonings, spread mixed spices all over each drumstick to coat the skin. Try these delicious combinations:


For hot and spicy drumsticks: combine 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt
For herb-encrusted drumsticks: combine 1/2 teaspoon dried basil, 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt

, Lay them on a part of the grill that isn't getting a stream of direct heat, since this will cook them too quickly.
 This will ensure they cook evenly on all sides. Keep going as each side turns golden brown and crispy., Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat. The drumsticks are ready when the internal temperature reaches 180ºF/82ºC.

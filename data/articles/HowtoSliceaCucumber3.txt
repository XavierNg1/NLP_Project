 Grip your knife handle with your middle, ring, and pinkie finger on the handle and your thumb and forefinger on the sides of the blade to steady your cut.Hold on to the cucumber with your opposite hand. Grip it lightly with your fingertips curled into it.
 Try to slice each piece evenly and aim for a thickness of 1-2mm (1/16in). This will leave you with thin rectangular cuts. Begin each cut with the knife handle up and the tip down into the cucumber. Push the blade forward as you push it down to create your cuts.


Your hand position should allow the side of the knife blade to gently rest against the knuckles of your other hand as you hold the cucumber. Making this cut with confidence takes practice. If you are nervous, grip your cucumber further back from your knife blade.
 Take each thin slice and repeat the same technique.Aim for dimensions of about 2mm X 2mm X 4cm (1/16in X 1/16in X 2in)., The Batonnet method is a variation of the Julienne cut which produces thicker pieces.


Simply cut your pieces into 6 cm (2.5 inch) long pieces, then cut each of those pieces into 6mm (1/4th) thick slices. Stack those slices, then cut them lengthwise into 6mm (1/4th) wide sticks., Julienne cut cucumbers work great in a salad, on a vegetable platter, or rolled into a sushi roll.

 Take stock of everything that you own, particularly vehicles, furniture, and heavy things that take up a lot of room.


How much are these items worth?
If it costs more to ship these possessions than to buy new ones, are you willing to let them go?;
, This will give you a time stamped record of the condition of your possessions.


If you choose to purchase insurance, be sure to get replacement cost only insurance. The other kind is literally based on the replacement cost of weight, not value.
 If you have any flexibility around your moving date, use the "flexible date" feature with online booking sites to figure out when the cheapest flights are.


Look into how much baggage an airline allows you to bring along. In some cases, you can bring up to 100 lbs of luggage with you, and additional luggage can be checked at a reasonable price. This can be useful if, say, you want to bring your computer with you for fear the movers may ruin it. You can wrap a computer tightly in bubble wrap and pack in a suitcase as part of your luggage allowance.
 There are many different options. Be sure to do your research and write down all quotes. Once you do the math, you'll be able to assess what will work with your resources.


Plan ahead if you need a hitch! If you need a hitch for your vehicle, make sure they will have hitch in stock. Sometimes you have to order it and it takes a few days before it will arrive.
If you rent a moving truck, how much will it cost to rent the size you need, and how many days and miles will that rate cover?
If you have a vehicle, how much would it cost to pull the vehicle with a tow dolly? It might also be cheaper to do things the other way around: Drive your vehicle and tow a trailer. How much will that cost?

, Find out how much it'd cost to hire a full-service moving company (this might be easier on your back and your possessions in terms of loading and unloading, see Warnings below).


You can also look into "self move" services, which drop off a containing unit, let you load it at your leisure, and pick it up and transport it for you.
There are sites where you can describe your needs and people will make bids as to how much they'll charge to do it for you. As with all your research, you want to ask how much it'll cost, how long it'll take, and how you're guarded against damages.
Books can often weigh a personal vehicle down significantly. Fear not! They can be shipped through the USPS at 'media rate'. Another often ignored option is using the greyhound shipping service which offers a huge discount to students. Both options allow you to pick up your items as much as 2 weeks later which is useful if you don't know where you are moving to!

, Do you trust that you can drive it over two thousand miles without worrying about it breaking down on you? Does it need any major repairs before it can withstand such a trip?


Most automobiles, reliable or not, should receive a major maintenance visit to the mechanic (with special attention to radiator, transmission, and brakes) before embarking on a cross-country trek. The cost of the maintenance could save thousands (literally) in emergency repairs, towing, etc.
If you're considering pulling a trailer, does your vehicle have enough horsepower to pull it across the distance and landscape you're looking at?
Driving across a country often means driving across different elevations, climates and terrains. Can your vehicle make it up and down a few mountains? Are the brakes in good shape? Does it have a tendency to overheat? Do the air conditioner and the heat work?
Check the weather. Weather.com and similar websites can actually give you the weather of your travel route. Consider things like mountain passes, if possible avoid them or be prepared to put chains on your vehicle if the situation requires it. Map your destination online and don't leave home without a current Road Atlas. Decide if investing in a satellite navigation system for your car is within your budget.
 Determine the fuel efficiency of the vehicle you'll be using so that you can estimate how much the fuel will cost.


Find out how many miles or kilometres your trip will cover, then divide that number by your MPG (miles per gallon) or km/l (kilometres per litre). That will tell you how much fuel you will need to cover the entire journey. Multiply that number by the current or expected price per gallon/price per litre to see how much money you'll be spending on gas through the whole trip.
Example: If your trip is 2,000 miles and your car gets 30 miles per gallon, then 2,000 miles / 30 miles = 66.5 gallons, approximately. If the price of fuel is at about $4 per gallon, the fuel will cost 66.5 gallons x $4 = $266.
Example: If your trip is 1,000 kilometres and your vehicle travels 15 kilometres per litre, then 1,000 km ÷ 15 km/l = 67 litres, approximately. If the price of fuel is at about €1 per litre, the fuel will cost 67 litres x €1 = €67.
Remember that the MPG or the km/l of your vehicle will be reduced if you'll be towing a trailer or adding considerable weight to the vehicle in any way.



How long will driving take?
If you must stay in hotels or motels, how much will it cost you? How much will you spend on meals and snacks?
Do you plan on sight-seeing on your way, perhaps tasting some wine, or visiting old friends?

, There are companies that specialize in shipping vehicles across long distances. Make phone calls and ask the following questions:


How long will it take?
How much will it cost?
How am I guarded against damages to my vehicle?
What is this company's reputation? You can usually find reviews online.

 Ship the rest. Fly to destination. It may be cheaper or only slightly more expensive to sell car, and other item first and then buy newer items at the destination. Take into account of the cost of shipping these heavy items and buying newer items at destination. One gets to enjoy newer technology in the case of tv, computer, and car.
 Consider options not listed here that are unique to your situation.


Maybe a friend or relative is willing to drive your vehicle and possessions across the country for you, just for the experience; you can offer to pay for their gas, lodging and it might still be cheaper than using a vehicle shipping service.
It could actually make sense for you to let go of all of your large possessions and travel by train or bus. The possibilities are endless. Consider what's best for you and your situation, and enjoy the ride!

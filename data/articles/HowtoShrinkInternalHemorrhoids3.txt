 Don’t wait once you feel the urge to have a bowel movement. Go as soon as you can. If you get to the toilet and you cannot go, then sit for a few minutes, but don’t sit too long. Sitting on the toilet for a long time may make hemorrhoids worse., See if you can arrange a regular time to use the bathroom without any interruptions. Having a bowel movement around the same time each day may make your bowel movements easier.For example, you might try to go every day at 8:30am and again at 7:00pm

, Straining is one of the main causes of hemorrhoids, so stop yourself if you notice that you are pushing too hard.If you cannot seem to have a bowel movement and notice that you are straining, then get up and come back in about an hour to try again. In the meantime, drink some water and move around a bit to help loosen things up.
 Sitting on a hard surface can also irritate hemorrhoids and make them worse. Try sitting on a soft foam cushion or on a doughnut shaped pillow instead. A cushion or doughnut pillow may help to relieve some of the pressure and discomfort of sitting on a hard surface.

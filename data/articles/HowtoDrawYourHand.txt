 You can make the drawing easier by ensuring that the photo is focused and that there is adequate lighting on your hand. Make sure the print is high-quality.;
, Begin by lightly drawing the basic shapes. This will help you with your proportions as you add details. Keep in mind that different hand positions will yield different shapes.
 Round out the fingertips and wrists, making sure not to change the proportions.
 Rather than drawing what you is lit well, look for shadows in the picture, and add them to your sketch, allowing the well-lit parts to appear as the absence of shadow. This will make your drawing look more realistic. Pay special attention to the indents and shading between fingers


Avoid excessive erasing. Draw lightly, and if you decide that you are unhappy with your drawing, simply go over it. Often times the first drawing only needs a bit of touching up.
 Note: the nail is important in recognizing the position of the hand, so do your best to draw it accurately.
 Once you are finished with your drawing, you can erase the excess lines on your page. Just be careful not to erase the lines that you like!

, If you haven't already, shade in the wrinkles and indents on your hand (to ensure a smooth shade, rub the shaded area lightly with your finger to spread the pencil around). Draw any scars or freckles if desired. Add anything else you think is missing.

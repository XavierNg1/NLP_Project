 Since you’re sleeping during the day because you’ve been up all night, make sure you avoid coffee, tea, or anything caffeine or stimulant related after midnight. Something at the beginning of your long night is fine, but just as it is during the day, if you have something too late you’ll be tossing and turning and unable to sleep once you lie down., This is really no different than a normal routine of working or being up during the day and sleeping at night. Eating healthy meals and getting plenty of exercise will help your body acclimate more quickly to being up all night and sleeping during the day.
 While it may very well help you fall asleep, alcohol can cause problems staying asleep, sleeping soundly and comfortably, and may cause you to wake up too early. The best rule of thumb is to avoid any kind of stimulant or depressant when on this reverse schedule.The exception to this rule of avoiding any “medicinal value” items like alcohol or sleep-aids is if your doctor prescribes you medication to alleviate a sleep issue.
 Before going to bed, wear dark sunglasses and even a brimmed hat to keep the sun out of your eyes as much as possible. Sunlight triggers your natural circadian rhythm and can make it hard to fall asleep if you’ve been exposed to it.

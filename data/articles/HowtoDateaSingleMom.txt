 You must remember that you are not her first priority. This doesn't mean that she doesn't like you. It doesn't mean that she doesn't care about your desires. It means that she has children to care for and their needs come first. By recognizing this, you are portraying yourself as a potential father and long-term partner.;
, This is not gentlemanly! A single mom is in a tough role. They have kids to look out for. If they become an emotional mess, it affects their kids.
 Having a single mom could be a great booty-call, if this is what she wants. Make your intentions known.
 A relationship will not work if it is built on false pretenses.
 Start with the woman and be sure you like her enough to be with her.
 If you meet and form a relationship with the kids, a break-up is MUCH MORE DIFFICULT! This will also affect the child in negative ways.

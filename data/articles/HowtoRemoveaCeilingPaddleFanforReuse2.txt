 Locate 4 screws along the edge of the fan housing cover, close to the ceiling. (There may be a plastic piece concealing the screws that you have to twist off.) Inspection of the screws should reveal that two of the screws (one on each side) need to be completely removed. The remaining two screws need only be loosened, as the housing has a slot to allow it to slip off when properly aligned. Remove the two screws that must be completely removed. Loosen the remaining screws 2 or 3 turns.;
, The weight will instantly shift from the ceiling to you. Lower the fan about 6 inches (15.2Â cm). With the support fixture in view, locate the hook. Align the hook with one of the two holes on the fixture housing (these were used for the support screws that were removed in the previous step), and hang.
 With the fan supported by the hook, identify the wires originating from the ceiling box. The fan should have bare or green, white and black (and blue if a light fixture was installed) wires connected. Identify the wires from the ceiling as "white", "fan" and "light" as they are connected to the fan. If the fan's black and blue wires connect together with a wire from the ceiling, mark it as "light". If the fan utilized an "RF remote" instead of a wall switch to control all or part of the ceiling fan / light fixture, disconnect it from the ceiling allowing it to remain with the fan for now. Remove the the bare / green wire from the support fixture. After all the wires have been disconnected, unhook and hand to helper. Skip ahead to "Finishing Up" below.

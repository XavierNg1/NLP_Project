Use smaller plates for dinner.
Use a smaller glass for juice.
When you eat tacos or burritos, use smaller tortillas.
 When you snack on shelled pistachios, you are far more likely to overeat. On the other hand, if you spend the time and energy to crack open the shells yourself, you give yourself more time to feel full. Additionally, some studies show that keeping the shells visible helps remind you how much you have eaten, thus reducing over-snacking.Peanuts and pistachios are easy to shell by hand.
Pecans, walnuts, and other nuts will require the use of a nut cracker.

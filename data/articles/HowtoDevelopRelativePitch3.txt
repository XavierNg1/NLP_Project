 The more you practice the better your relative pitch will become. You also need to practice consistently. Practicing every single day one week and then only practicing twice the next week is not good practice. It would be better to have short sessions every day of the week.Try to do 10 minutes of training each day. This is the absolute minimum.
 If your sessions are too long, you run the risk of overtraining. Your ears will become tired, and you wonâ€™t be able to hear the notes as you normally would. If your ears get tired or you are no longer progressing in your training session, take a break or stop for the day.A training session may consist of 15 minutes of listening and singing chords and 15 minutes of interval and chord practice with your instrument.
 Ear training should be part of your life no matter how good you get. Be sure to spend enough time on each skill instead of going back and forth. Write down a study plan that you will follow. Your study plan should include the skill you plan to work on and the length of the training period.For example, you may spend January and February learning major intervals using reference songs, and then spend March and April learning minor intervals using reference songs.
Using computer software like Earmaster and Transcribe can also help you outline your sessions and track your progress.

 If you prefer to shower at night, go ahead and do so.


Shave: While you are in the shower, shave your under-arms and legs. If you wax your arms and legs, then do this one or two days before school starts so that your skin has time to settle and doesn't look red.
Use a quality shampoo made specially for your hair type (oily, dry, limp, etc.), and a quality conditioner.
Wash your body with a scented body-wash or soap.
If possible, air-dry your hair and gently pat your skin dry.
Apply a quality moisturizer after the shower. This is optional, as most young skin does not need moisturizing.;
, First, wash with warm water to open your pores, Then use a cleanser, and after, try an exfoliating scrub or a mud mask. Sugar can be a great for exfoliating and softening skin.Instead of using your normal moisturizer, you could use olive oil or jojoba oil., If you use whitening strips, put them on now but talk to your parents about this first, as whiteners contain a lot of chemicals that they might not consider appropriate for your age. Don't forget to floss.
 Apply any hair care products you normally use.
 Also, if you prefer to carry a purse, then pack that as well.
,, If you did shower, at least wipe your face clean.
 For example, toast with peanut butter and a glass of orange juice is a healthy, well-balanced option.
 Then use a toner to even out and moisturize your skin.
 Avoid having food stuck in your teeth for the first day of school.
, If you are younger, then stick with neutral, or light pink eye-shadow. Also apply mascara, lip balm, and lip gloss. Apply concealer to cover any imperfections. Going without makeup is perfectly fine too.


Are you not allowed to wear makeup? Use tinted lip balm or simply appreciate the fact that youth ensures that you're beautiful.
, Earrings, necklaces, or bracelets add a nice touch to your outfit.
 In case you sweat, you don't want to smell bad. Bring a trial/travel size with you to school.

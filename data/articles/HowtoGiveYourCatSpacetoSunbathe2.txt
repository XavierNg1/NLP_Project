 You can also provide your cat with space to sunbathe by taking them outside on a leash. It is relatively easy to leash train a cat. Try tethering your cat to a stationary object, such as a tree in your backyard. Your cat can enjoy sunbathing outside while you complete yard work or relax outside.Do not leave your cat tethered outside unsupervised because they may get caught or tangled.
 Screened porches will allow your cat to experience an outdoor environment in a controlled and safe space. For instance, a screened in porch will have plenty of natural sunlight for your cat to sunbathe. It will also allow your cat to hear and smell the outdoors, which is stimulating., If your cat spends some time outdoors, then you could install a cat door so that your cat can easily leave the house. This will allow your cat to find a space to sunbathe outside, if desired.You could also create a “catio” or cat run in your backyard that is fully enclosed and connected to the house through a cat door.

 Place 1 small potato in a medium stockpot and cover with water. Place the pot on the stove on high heat to bring it to a boil. Allow the potato to boil for 5 to 10 minutes, or until you can easily pierce it with a fork. Remove the pot from the heat, and drain the potato.After draining the potato, let it cool for 10 to 15 minutes, or until you can comfortably touch it.;
, Place the cooled potato in a small bowl, and use a fork to mash it. Next, add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil and mix it with the potato to form a thick paste.You can substitute sweet almond oil for the olive oil if you prefer.
 When the potato and oil are mixed, carefully cover both of your hands with the mixture. Let the mask sit for at least 15 minutes so it has time to penetrate and soothe the dry, irritated skin.When you apply the mask, gently massage it in in a circular motion for the best results.
 When itâ€™s time to remove the mask, rinse if off with warm water. Pat your hand dry with a towel, and apply a hand cream to ensure that your hands stay soft and smooth.

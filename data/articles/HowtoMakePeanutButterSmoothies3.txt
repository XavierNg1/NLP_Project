 This version of the peanut butter smoothie is a little less healthy, but it makes a great treat or dessert and still has plenty of protein. For this recipe, you'll need:


Blender
Chocolate syrup (2 tblsp)
Milk (Â½ cup)
Peanut butter (creamy, 2 tblsp)
Yogurt (vanilla recommended; 8 oz (227 g)), Unplug the blender, if necessary, then add your ingredients to it. This will prevent you from accidentally starting the blender while adding things to it, which could send food flying. Once you're finished adding ingredients, snap the lid into place firmly and plug in the blender.


Packing ingredients too tightly in your blender can sometimes prevent the blades from turning. Avoid over packing your blender., While your blender may have other settings, the "Blend" setting will be sufficient for your smoothie. Press and hold the button for short intervals until the mixture is smooth and no chunks of ingredients remain.Pour the smoothie into a cup and enjoy.
 Any extra smoothie left over can be stored in an airtight container and refrigerated. Try to leave as little air in the container with your smoothie as possible. Air will cause nutrients in your smoothie to break down.


If properly stored and refrigerated, your leftover smoothie should last from 12 hours to a day.,

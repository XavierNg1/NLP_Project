 Prepare your painting area by putting tarps or drop cloths under the leather so that paint doesn't get everywhere. Make sure to paint the leather in a well-ventilated room so that you don't inhale paint fumes., If if you plan on painting leather furniture, it's a good idea to disassemble the furniture before you start painting, so that paint doesn't drip onto other parts of the furniture.If you are painting leather shoes, remember to take the shoelaces out before you start painting it.

If you can't disassemble the item, you can tape off the portions that you don't want to paint.
 Dampen a rag with isopropyl alcohol and wipe down the surface of the leather. The alcohol will remove any preliminary coatings, waxes, or oils that are on the surface of the leather, which will help the paint adhere to the leather.Isopropyl alcohol may not be strong enough to remove all leather finishes.
 If your leather is still shiny, sanding off the shiny areas with a 100 - 200 grit sandpaper will remove portions of the glossy finish that might be left over after wiping it down with the alcohol.Put the sandpaper in the palm of your hand and work back and forth on shiny areas in the leather., Before you start painting the leather, make sure that the surface is clean. Take a damp rag or a microfiber cloth and wipe over the surface of the leather. Continue wiping down the leather until all dirt and debris are lifted off.Any dirt or dust left on the surface of the leather will be embedded in the paint.
 You can purchase a bottle of leather preparer and deglazer at craft stores or online. Saturate a rag with the preparer and deglazer and work it generously onto the surface of the leather.The preparer and deglazer will dry fast because it's alcohol based.
Leather preparer and deglazer formulas are made specifically to help paint adhere to leather.
The preparer and deglazer may fade the old color of your leather.

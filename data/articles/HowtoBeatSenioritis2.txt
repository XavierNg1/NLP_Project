 If you feel sluggish and unhealthy, time can seem to drag on very slowly. Dedicate this year to staying (or getting) healthy. Eat healthy food full of protein to give you energy, and exercise to burn off excess energy when you’re feeling anxious about school.When summer comes, you’ll be glad you spent the year getting healthy. You’ll have plenty of energy and will feel good about yourself while having plenty of free time for adventures.
 Even if school seems like no fun right now, it does afford you access to certain things that you won’t have after graduation. Take advantage of these things while you can.If your school has a gym or a track, use it.
Spend quality time with a favorite teacher or mentor. Ask if you can help them with anything after school or ask their advice about colleges or careers.
Take out books from the school library.
Make an appointment with the school counselor to talk about your plans for next year or your career path.
 Spending time with friends is important. If most of the people in your friend group plan to move away or study elsewhere next year, this is the last time you’ll all be together for a while. Make time to be together in ways that are healthy and fun.Organize a graduation party with your friends.
You can put together a fundraiser, such as a car wash or a dance to raise money for a class trip.
Study for final exams together.
 If you’re going off to college or graduate school, or if you plan to join the military or another demanding profession, you’ll have your work cut out for you next year. Take this as an opportunity to practice dedication and hard work.Working hard is like anything else, it gets easier to do as you practice it.
Don’t overdo it. Remember that it’s okay to take breaks and have some fun when it’s appropriate.

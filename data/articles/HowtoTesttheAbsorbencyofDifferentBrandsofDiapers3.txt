 Knowing the weight of the diaper before putting it on your baby gives you a reference point for later. Each brand will likely have a different weight. Be sure to do this for each diaper you want to compare.This experiment will be done over many hours or even days. Keep track of your diapers and how well they perform in a chart. Have a column for brand, dry weight, wet weight, difference between dry and wet weights, and amount of time that the diaper was on the baby.
 Do this just as you would do any other time. The idea of this method is to test how diapers perform on the baby. Make sure that the baby wears the same clothing overtop of each diaper you test. Otherwise, differences in how the clothing fits over the diaper (and puts pressure on the diaper) could interfere with your results., The most reliable time to do this test is at night. Nighttime is also the longest stretch that a diaper will need to keep your baby dry. Write down the time you put each diaper on, and the time you took it off.Change diapers when they are wet. Do not leave wet diapers on your baby to try to absorb more, as this could lead to diaper rash and skin irritation for your baby.
 Unfortunately, measuring time alone is not an accurate way to gauge how hard a diaper is working. Your baby may not urinate exactly the same amount every night. To help level the playing field, take a final weight for each diaper to see how much urine it absorbed during the time it was worn.Subtract the dry weight that you took before putting the diaper on from the wet weight. This will give you the weight of the urine absorbed.
 Go through the same series of steps with each brand of diapers. The more methodical you are with your process, the more accurate your comparison will be. While testing diapers on your baby will help you get a feel for what brand of diaper performs best on your child, keep in mind that it is not the same as a controlled experiment to test absorbency.

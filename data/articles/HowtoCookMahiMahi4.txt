 Try mixing cumin, garlic powder, dried oregano, ground ginger, smoked paprika, salt, and black and red peppers, or any other seasonings you prefer. Pour this over your mahi mahi before cooking with any of the methods, or let it soak in the fridge for about 10 minutes before cooking.
 Try making a quick salsa of diced tomatoes, mango, jalapeno, red onion, cilantro, cumin, garlic and lime juice to enjoy with your cooked mahi mahi.
 Here's the fun part. Because mahi mahi has such a light and delicate flavor, it is easy to influence the taste of the meat with any of your favorite seasonings. Lightly dust your mahi mahi with simple salt and pepper, or experiment with several dry seasonings and sauces for the ultimate mahi mahi.

 On a piece of drawing paper, get into a cat state of mind by writing what cats represent to you.  Sleek, stretchy, serpentine, elegant, night stalkers, hunters, prowlers, silent, aloof, clean, dainty and self sufficient, and so forth.
 Keep the drawing small, approximately and inch and as simple as possible.
 Add rings to the interior of the circle, using smaller plates, graduating sizes until you come to the center. Use the lid of a bottle to make a 2 to 2 1/2  inch circle.
 Poses that bend, stretch, and elongate will take up space so use them to advantage. Try adding cat accessories and accoutrements such as mice, toys, balls of yarn, kittens, and a soft rug.
, Use 1/2 to 3/4 inch flat brushes to begin painting your cats.  Block in the cat's bodies with as few strokes as possible. When dry, return with smaller, pointed brushes and add details.
 Step back and view the painting and decide how to treat the area around the circle. It can be kept simple to allow the circle to be the predominant feature

 Think about what you have to do. Make a To Do list on your computer so you can see everything, rearrange items, put items into categories, and delete them when they're finished. With a written list, you won't forget anything (even if you don't ever actually do it all). Or you can make a mental list, but then you'll drive yourself crazy trying to remember everything in your head.;
, First priority goes to things that are a few hours away (e.g., a paper due at 8 am), last priority to things that are a week away. Factor in the amount of time necessary for each task (reading War and Peace vs. writing a 200-word reflection on your eating habits).
 Recommended: surfing the internet, playing video games, doing art, dancing, going on adventures, television, cooking a gourmet meal, etc.
 Simply get started ... sort of. If you have a paper to write, open up a word processing document and type your name and the date in the header and maybe the first line. An outline would be a good place to start if you're that type of person.
 Open up a window of your favorite browser and start surfing. Great places: wikis, travel sites about secluded nations (e.g., Mongolia), blog sites, etc. If you're less internet inclined, T.V., music, video games, etc., are good things.
 Get work done bit by bit instead of focusing exclusively on the required item. When you realize that you only have an hour or two left, buckle down a bit more and get more work done.

 When people are watching on TV or in the theater, they'll be thinking, "Wow, that character is kinda weird!" not, "Wow, that actor is really weird." When acting, just imagine that you're not 'you' anymore, you're the character.;
, No one else is watching you, you're alone on the set, practicing your lines.
, Try to fool the others into thinking you aren't embarrassed at all, and you may end up fooling yourself as well.
 Take a deep breath before walking on set, calm yourself, and tell yourself that you're a great actor, and there's no reason to be embarrassed about your acting.

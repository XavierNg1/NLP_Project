 This top was taken from a 1970s round table. It took a little bit of sanding to remove the blemishes.;

Cut lower attachment pieces to 14.5” long. Chamfer the width dimension to a 60 degree angle. Chamfer the thickness dimension to 15 degrees.






Cut the upper attachment pieces to 7” long. Chamfer the width dimension to a 60 degree angle. Chamfer the thickness dimension to 15 degrees.
 Use a pocket-hole jig to drill the connection holes. Think ahead at this point to make sure the holes are on the bottom (floor) and under the table top. Add glue to the joint before screwing together.
, Chamfer the thickness dimension on both ends to 15 degrees – see picture.
,, Use wood filler to cover the screw holes and any gaps in the wood. Sand to remove wood filler and clean up the joint lines.
 This version used white for the legs and green for the top.
 Drill a small hole at the intersection of the upper attachment assembly. This will be the center location for the round top.
 Find the center of the round top. Measure the diameter. Use a string or tape measure set to the radius and draw a light arc. Move the string to another point on the edge of the table and draw another arc. The intersection of these two arcs is the center. Try a third arc to verify. Drill a hole at the intersection.
 Use a nail or rod to line up the hole in the leg assembly and the hole in the round top. This will keep the top centered on the leg assembly. Drill pilot holes through the upper attachment subassembly. Use wood screws to attach the leg assembly to the top. Make sure the screws don’t protrude through the top.

 Choose Word because it’s readily available and allows you to resize the photo. Also, Word compresses graphics, which will make it easier to print than if you were using a graphics program like Photoshop or a photo-editing program like Picasa.;
,,, Remember that you don’t have to reproduce the design slavishly. If some parts are too fiddly to cut, feel free to simplify. Where there are areas of overlap, for example, between the oil cups and the back plate, you’ll have to figure out how to interpret the design. The design must remain interconnected so that pieces don’t fall apart, unless you plan to glue them in later.
,,, Located on the right side of the photo, there is a pair of Mag Eyes. It is strongly recommended that you use these because they reduce the eye strain and make it much easier to see fine details.
 You get a more accurate representation that way. The blobby finials at the top were turned into fleur-de-lis because it was easier to cut them.
 Occasionally turn your work over to check the accuracy of your cuts.
 You will work it after the symmetrical part has been unfolded.
,, Go over the design carefully and neaten the edges, cutting wispy bits away, straightening corners, and refining curves.
 Don’t try to apply glue to the entire cutting. A dab in each corner will be sufficient. Wait a few hours or a day before mounting your paper-cutting.
 All done!

 Put on at least SPF 30 sunscreen everyday, even if it’s cloudy or cold outside. UVA and UVB rays lead to wrinkles, dryness, and drooping skin.Reapply sunscreen several times throughout the day.
 Before getting into the shower, wipe your body with a loofah. This will remove dead skin cells. Make sure to wipe your entire body. In the shower, use a pumice stone to rub your feet and any other rough areas of skin, such as your elbows. For the rest of your body, use a body brush to gently rub your skin. At the end of your shower, turn the water as cold as you can stand. This will close your pores.When you get out of the shower, dry your body by patting it with a towel. Avoid rubbing your skin aggressively with a towel.
 After patting your skin dry, apply a gentle moisturizing to your entire body. Don’t forget about the bottoms of your feet, your elbows, and your hands.

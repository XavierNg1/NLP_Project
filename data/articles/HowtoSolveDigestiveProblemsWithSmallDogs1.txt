 A healthy digestive system produces a formed stool which can be picked up. Dogs usually move their bowel after eating, so if your dog is fed twice a day, their natural tendency is to toilet twice a day - although individual variation occurs and if it is normal for your dog to go once or three times a day, then that's fine., If you let the dog out into the yard and for days on end never check what they've produced, this can mean you miss the early stages of a digestive upset. Do a daily poop patrol so that you are aware of changes in consistency and color, and know if blood or mucus is present.
 If the dog vomits, take note of the color and consistency. An occasional barf is nothing to be concerned about, but if the dog seems unwell and vomits, he repeatedly retches and doesn't bring anything up (a sign of bloat) or vomits repeatedly over the course of a few hours, then you should seek veterinary attention. In the meantime, whilst you are waiting for the appointment, take his food away but leave water down. It is best to rest the dog's stomach.
 Indications that your dog may have a digestive problem include its feces becoming runny or liquid, the presence of blood or mucus in the feces, repeated straining to move his bowel, and increased frequency of passing a motion. If necessary, take a photo of your dog's abnormal bowel movement as it is helpful for your veterinarian to see the consistency for himself.

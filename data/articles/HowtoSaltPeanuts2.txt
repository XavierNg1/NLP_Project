 It’s common to roast peanuts after soaking them in a salt brine. To ensure that the oven is hot enough, set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) and allow the oven to fully heat.Depending on your oven, it should take approximately 10 to 15 minutes for it to preheat.
Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it’s reached the proper temperature. Most models will beep or flash an indicator light to alert you.
 When the peanuts are dry, divide them between two half sheet pans. Make sure to place them in a single layer so the peanuts aren’t piled on top of one another.If you don’t have half sheet pans, you can use smaller pans. However, you may need to roast the peanuts in multiple batches so you can spread the peanuts out in a single layer.
 Once the peanuts are the half sheet pans, place them in the preheated oven. Allow them to roast for 30 to 35 minutes, making sure to rotate the pans approximately halfway through roasting.During the last 10 minutes of roasting, start checking the peanuts to see if they’re done. Use a pair of tongs to remove one from the pan and allow it to cool for several minutes. When it’s cool enough to handle, open it -- the inside of the shell should be a little darker than the outside., After you remove the pans from the oven, the peanuts continue to cook for several minutes and will become crunchy. Let them cool for 10 to 15 minutes before eating them.

 This can be done through clothes or actions. As with any flirting, be sure to not overdo it or you'll risk looking cheap.


Girls, try moving your hips, playing with your hair, or "accidentally" dropping something, only to show off your butt while picking it up.
Guys, show off your physical features. Butt, muscles,strong hands, stomach.
 Hold eye contact for slightly longer than usual.
 Lets say you and the other person are sitting next to each other. Why not say a funny joke? While you two are laughing, unintentionally lightly place your hand on the persons arm.
 Shaking hands or hugging is a very good start. It brings you closer together.


Girls, if you and your man are walking, try faking a trip. Fall towards the man so that he can catch you, but don't let go too quickly! Stare into his eyes as if saying, "You just saved my life." Then look around as if saying, "this is awkward", then giggle.

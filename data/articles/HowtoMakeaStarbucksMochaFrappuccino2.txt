 Pour 1 1/2 cups (355 ml) of very strong, chilled coffee into a blender. Add 1 cup (240 ml) of whole milk, 1/3 cup (80 ml) of sweetened condensed milk, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1/4 cup (60 ml) of chocolate syrup.The whole milk and sweetened condensed milk will make the frappuccino very rich and creamy.
 Pour in enough ice to fill your blender to the top. Put the lid on the blender and blend the mixture until it's completely smooth. This should take 30 seconds to a minute, depending on how powerful your blender is.For even creamier drinks, you can also pour in and blend 1/4 cup (60 ml) of half-and-half.
 Pour the frappuccinos into your serving glasses. Since this makes an entire blender full, you should be able to get about six servings. Garnish them with whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles.

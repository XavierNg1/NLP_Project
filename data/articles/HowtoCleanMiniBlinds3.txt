 Follow the directions for doing this above. Next, bring your blinds outside and lay them on a tarp or old shower curtain. You can put them on the grass or your driveway.


Choose this method if your blinds are too big for your tub.
 Be gentle when you spray and try not to soak the blinds. If you have the blinds open, you only need to spray them once. If they are closed for stability, turn them over after spraying one side.
 Put the water and vinegar solution on a rag, old sock, or other cleaning cloth and rub down both sides of each slat. Use biodegradable soap if you donâ€™t want to use vinegar outside. Rinse the blinds with the hose.
 Lay your blinds on some towels to blot out the extra water. Lay them on a clean part of your lawn, preferably on dry towels to let them air dry. You can also carefully drape them over a deck railing or fence to let them air dry. Carefully hang them back in your house once they are dry.

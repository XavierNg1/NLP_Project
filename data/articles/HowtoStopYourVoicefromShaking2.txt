 Go for a run in the morning or walk around the building before you have to give a speech, perform, or have a tough conversation. Letting go of as much nervous energy as you can will help you with your anxiety. This should also allow you to manage the shakiness.
 Go to the bathroom right before your talk or speech. Stick your tongue out as far as you can, and say a nursery rhyme or one of your tongue twisters with your tongue out. As ridiculous as this feels, it actually opens up your throat. This will make more space for sound in there, providing you with a stronger and louder speaking voice., This is important whether you’re standing or sitting. Place your feet about shoulder-width apart. Keep your feet flat on the ground, and don’t rock, sway, or shift your weight from side to side. This is your power stance. Embrace it., Having slumped shoulders and bad posture will actually make it harder for you to breathe deeply. This means that it’ll be even harder for you to speak clearly and without a shaky voice. Slouching will also make you look nervous, so it’s something to avoid during public speaking for lots of reasons., If you’re feeling nervous as you’re getting ready to start speaking, focus on your breathing. Pretend you have that towel around your waist, and push it out a few times. The oxygen will energize you, while focusing on the exercise will calm your nerves., Bring a water bottle along with you just in case no one gives you water. Getting hydrated will keep your voice clear rather than scratchy and dry. You also don’t want to get dehydrated while you speak, as this could make you feel light-headed.

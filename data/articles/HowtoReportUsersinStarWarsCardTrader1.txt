, You will be brought to the fan feeds. These are the posts made by the players or traders, and they get updated in real-time.
 If you see something inappropriate, like bullying, spamming, scamming, fighting, implying sexists or racists jokes, you should stop at that post and take a moment to report it.


Be sure that what you’re reporting is true and accurate. You just don’t report someone because you don’t like them or because they rejected your trade offer.
 Tap on the username of the fan who made the inappropriate post, and a menu will appear. Tap the “Report Fan” button from here, and the “Report Fan” window will appear, with the fan’s username on the top.
 The “Report Fan” window is a form you need to complete and submit in order for Topps, the company that developed the game, to review. A list of common violations is displayed. You can choose from Hate Speech, Scam Talk, Spam, Bullying, Fan Image, and Other. Tap on the violation related to your report.
 There’s a bottom section on the window for Additional Info. Type in further details related to the violation being reported. Be true and accurate in your report.
 When you’re done, tap the “Send” button on the top right corner of the window. The window will close, and your report will be sent to Topps.

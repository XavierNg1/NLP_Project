 Shuffle the deck and deal each person 26 cards. Count your articles of clothing to ensure that you and your opponent are wearing the same number of items. With your stack of cards face down, begin playing by flipping a card. Whoever has the higher card takes both.
 Anytime you put down equal cards, e.g. if you both put down Queens or both put down sevens, you have to play War to break the tie. You and your opponent both put down the next card in your stack face down, and the following card face up. Whoever has the higher face-up card takes all six cards that are now on the table.If the face-up cards are the same, play War again until someone has a higher card.
 If the first tiebreaker face-up cards match and there has to be a second tiebreaker, the loser has to remove two articles of clothing. The same goes for three consecutive tiebreakers, and so on.
 This goal of this version of Strip War is the same as regular War, and it takes less time than the first method of Strip War because only one game is played. Because you do not know how many tiebreakers you may have in a game, you may end up stripping off multiple articles of clothing or none at all. This may be an advantage or a disadvantage, depending on how you look at it.

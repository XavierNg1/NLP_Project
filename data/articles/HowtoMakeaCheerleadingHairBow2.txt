 Make sure there are no unnecessary twists in the ribbon.
 Pinch the middle with your thumb and forefinger and squish it all together. You're not creating an actual tie and bow, it just looks like it.

 This will be used to secure the hair tie to the ribbon piece. Try not to use too much -- you don't want to get yourself gloopy. The technical term!

 Make sure the hair tie is under the ribbon to secure it in place. If the twist tie is still too long, cut off the excess.










Optional: You can remove the twist tie once the glue has dried or keep it there for extra strength. And, if you so choose, you can take that 3 inches (7.6Â cm) of ribbon you cut out earlier and glue gun it over the twist tie to obscure it from view.

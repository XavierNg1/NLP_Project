 Brush the child's teeth. Put their favourite PJ's on. Also, 1 or 2 hours before bed, have some quiet time and slowly ease them out of being rambunctious and energetic.
 Many kids get read a story before bed, so try it if that's what they're used to. When tucking them in, you can also sing a lullaby, tell them a story, or give them something (not sugary) to drink like water or warm milk.
 Also, if the kids are scared of monsters, take an empty spray bottle and tape on the label, "Monster Spray" or "Monsters, Go Away!" on the bottle, tell the kids that this is invisible monster spray that will make the monsters go away, and "spray" the invisible "monster spray" into the air.

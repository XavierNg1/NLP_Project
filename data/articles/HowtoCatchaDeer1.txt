 Most states have either a Department of Wildlife or a Department of Natural Resources. The appropriate governing body that handles hunting and trapping in your state may go by a different name, though. Find the website for the department and look up information related to trapping deer in your area.;
, Many states forbid the trapping of deer, and using any type of trap to catch a deer can result in stiff fines and penalties. Other states, such as Minnesota, prohibit the use of any type of bait to hunt or catch deer, making most traps ineffective. Read the laws governing trapping deer in your state carefully, including licensing, methods, seasons, antlered vs. antlerless zones, etc.
 Once you know how to catch deer in your area lawfully, apply for the appropriate license. Deer fall under the big game license in nearly every state. The application will require your name, address, and other standard information. A licensing fee will also be associated with the process.

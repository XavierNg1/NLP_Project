 This will help you understand what you have the potential to be.;
, It will give you a place to start and help you get better at learning beats, as well as what is essential to making your own beats.
, This is important if you are looking to be in a band, a steady beat is what everyone loves in a drummer. You may also want to brush on solo skills. Sometimes a solo may be just a new improved kick beat. It could be Neal Peart's YYZ or another marching solo.
 They will save your life. As more and more bands follow metronomes, you will need it more. If you can play along with a metronome, even if it is only a simple beat, that will get you farther than you can imagine.
 These are also important because it gives you a chance to show your skills and gain Rep. You would want to make these simple, but not too simple. Solos need to be fast but do not give the impression that you are just hitting drums without structure. A good place to start is to alternate hitting the toms back and forth while hitting the bass drum. Also, try loosely holding the sticks when you hit the snare a high-hat. When hitting the high-hat in a solo take your foot off the pedal in coalition with your foot hitting the bass pedal. If loosely follow these rules and be creative you will be amazed of what you can accomplish.
 In a four-beat measure try hitting any cymbal for all four beats, then hit the snare on any beat you want, you can even hit the snare twice in the same measure, also try to incorporate the bass drum on all, two, three, or even one, and try changing the bass beat from one measure to another. The possibilities are endless.
 Just let your creativity flow.
 Always remember to be relaxed, but not too relaxed, behind the metronome, but not late. Take it easy on your joints - stretch before drumming.
 It will improve your speed a lot. Practice with a metronome.

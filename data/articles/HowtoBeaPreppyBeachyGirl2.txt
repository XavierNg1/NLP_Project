, They can either be pearl studs or pearl dangles. Pearls are from the beach, thus they are beachy.
 You can also buy silver and gold bangles. With thick wooden ones, only wear two at a time. For the thinner silver and gold ones, layer on 5-8 at a time.
 Get a piece of natural looking brown cord. Then, string on 2 wooden beads. String on 1 shell with a hole in it. Finally, string on 2 more wooden beads, the same as the first two. Make sure they fit around your neck and match. It is best if the shall already had a hole in it. Wear only one of these at a time. You can make several to mix and match.
 Buy them in beachy colors. They should also be either solid, have a small bow, or collegiate looking stripes.

 "Snail mail" can take a while to be processed, delivered, read, and replied to.


A time before that and people may write it off thinking, "I don't know what I'm doing for breakfast, much less next month!" Too soon and people already have plans. Around 2 weeks out is your best bet.
 An outdated or misspelled address could leave one of your best friends out of your party! If you're not sure of someone's address, contact them and confirm it.
 A mailed invitation is a great opportunity to impress a guest, but don't over-complicate an invitation to a simple party - this may intimidate guests. You're just inviting them for a good time!


Have something on the envelope that clearly indicates your invitation is something to be intrigued by. Yours isn't just another piece of junk mail!

 Choose the manga character that you like best. Read their comics and try to study them completely. Look up their dressing style and find some inspiration from them.;
, Stick to it everyday, as most manga are thin. Try to include aerobic exercise 3 days a week and strength training 2 days a week. Stretch everyday. You will get fit over the summer and look great.
 Not only will a healthy diet help you lose weight, but you will also get a healthy glow and clear skin. Try to include 5-7 servings of fruits and vegetables, 6 servings of grains, 3 servings of dairy, and 3-4 servings of protein.
 Go to a salon to get your hair cut and colored the same way as the character. Go to an optometrist and order some colored contacts in the same color as the character. If they are tanner than you, get some tanning lotion. If they are paler than you, get some skin lightening cream or make your own.

Use a small amount for a thin layer.
Gently pat the product in with your finger, brush (made specifically for emollient products), or a sponge.;
, This, unlike the first product we used, does not "dry". Basically the second base you apply should be a little tacky. Now, with your finger or a small sponge, apply a very thin layer on your eyelid over the first base. If you put too much on your eyelids, it will crease, so just a little will do.



Tap off the extra shadow.
Pat the brush onto the lower part of your upper eyelid, if the intensity is not enough apply another layer.
Work your way up to your brow bone or whichever way you are applying your colors.
Remember to keep patting the different shadows on.
Blend the colors together gently with small strokes.
When you are done with your main colors use a clean brush and a lighter color for your brow highlight.
Pat on and gently downward to diffuse the line of color.
, If you applied just a little of the cream base and a nice amount of eyeshadow, you shouldn't get creasing. If you do, next time try less cream base and a little more eyeshadow pressed in firmly.

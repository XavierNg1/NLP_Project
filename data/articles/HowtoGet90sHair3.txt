Then add pomade, gel or hairspray to seal the look., Use Velcro rollers or a blow drier with a diffuser to add some volume to your roots. Then part your hair on the side and comb it over. You can let it hang loose like Linda Evangelista’s 90s hairstyle, pin it behind your ear like Gwyneth Paltrow did, or train it to one side with pomade like Drew Barrymore.


Try tousling and spiking a short ‘do in all directions like Winona Ryder’s 90s look.
Brush your bangs straight down to emulate how Toni Braxton and Demi Moore wore their short cuts.
 Jennifer Aniston on “Friends” wore one of the most recognizable 90s hairstyles. You can repeat this look with or without layered hair. Just separate your hair into two layers, curling the top layer inwards and the bottom layer outwards.


Try using varying sizes of round brushes to blow-dry your hair to add the volume and curl.You can use curlers or a large barrel curling wand to achieve this look.

 Add a bit of hair paste if you want your hair to look semi-wet, or serum if you want it somewhat shiny. Comb your hair with a wide tooth comb until you achieve an untidy appearance.

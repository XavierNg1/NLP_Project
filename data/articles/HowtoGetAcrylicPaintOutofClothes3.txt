 Drop it into a sink or bucket filled up with water. Let it soak in there for a minute before you continue. You want it to be thoroughly drenched.
, Twist the clothing together to wring out the water. Try to get out a good amount of water so that it’s not dripping heavily, but don’t worry if it’s still wet or damp. You want it to be damp – that was the whole point of soaking it after all.
 Now scrub the paint stain with this cloth or sponge. Don’t be afraid to scrub pretty hard. Dip in the solution as often as needed until the stain appears to be lifting.
 Now check to see if the stain has been lifted. Repeat if it is still there. Hopefully after repeating this process once or twice the stain should have faded away. You will see immediate results. 







, Wash as usual and then dry your clothes. Check again and see if the stain has now gone. If you still aren’t satisfied you can repeat the process but you probably will only see results with diminishing returns.

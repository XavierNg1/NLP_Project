 Open the message, document, or web page that contains the photo you'd like to keep on your MacBook.


Not all web pages permit images to be saved or downloaded.
 Click on the yellow button in the upper-left corner of the window that contains the image. This makes the window smaller so that your Mac's desktop is visible.
 Using your trackpad or mouse, move the cursor over the picture you want to save.
 Use your trackpad or mouse to do so.
 While holding the click, use your trackpad or mouse to slide the image out of its current window and onto your Mac's desktop. A thumbnail of the image will follow the cursor.
 When you see a white + in a green circle appear over the thumbnail of the picture, release the click you were holding. Now the picture has been saved to the desktop on your MacBook.

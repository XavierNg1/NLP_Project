 Clean the roots in fresh water. Then, use a regular vegetable peeler to peel off the rough outside of the roots. You should have white, tender root vegetables., You can use the roots like potatoes. Chop them up into thin slices. If you are frying up some eggs in the morning, you can fry the cattails like you would potatoes. Put some oil in the pan and fry them up until they get brown on the outside. They will be slightly fibrous but make for a delicious breakfast., Fill a bowl with water. Put the roots in the bowl of water and squeeze the roots to gradually remove the starch. After working the roots in the water, let the starch settle in the bowl for three hours. Then, remove the excess water from the top to reveal the starch, which should be settled at the bottom of the bowl.Alternately, you can use a sharp knife or a rock to remove the starch from the roots. Scrape the roots with the knife to push the starch out onto a rock. Then, let the starch dry in the sun.
 Use a dehydrator to dry the starch. If you are camping, you could lay it out in the sun. If you are at home but do not have a dehydrator, you could use the lowest temperature in your oven., You can use a grain grinder or a mortar and pestle. Then, use the cattail flour alongside other flours or on its own to make bread or other dishes.

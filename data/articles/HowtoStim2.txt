 Plenty of fidgets and desk toys involve some sort of moving patterns.


Snow globes
Lava lamps
Mobiles (A mobile of planets is considered socially acceptable for older ages.)
Glitter jar (made from water, glitter glue, food coloring, and glitter)

, Watch the wind move long grass or leaves in trees. If nature isn't easily available to you, look up calming nature videos on the internet. Even 30 seconds of watching a video of long grass can help you feel relaxed.
 These can feel very calming. Many follow a specific pattern, which can be pleasing for autistic people whose brains are optimized for systematizing.


The "Mesmerizing Gifs" thread on reddit contains plenty of gifs.Be careful about gifs if you have epilepsy.
 Try messing with a flashlight, lighting fireworks, or flickering the light in a room (if no one else is there).


Try moving colored paper or translucent objects over flashlights to see cool colors and patterns.
Download light- and pattern-related games onto your mobile device, such as a firework-generating app.
 This can provide gentle stimulation to help you in overwhelming situations.
 Sometimes parents or friends of autistic people will make adorable videos of them spinning around, and the autistic people will post them online.
 This is socially acceptable in most environments, and it lets you have a pleasant song in your head for the next few hours.



Repeat things that you need to remember, such as material from your exam study guide.
Repeat something nice someone said to you.
Repeat something you read.

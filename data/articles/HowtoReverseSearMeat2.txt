 Create a 2-zone setup for your charcoal grill. To do this, heat your coals and carefully push them to one side of the grill. This will give you an empty or cool side where there are no coals.


If you'll be using a gas grill, turn one half or side of the grill on and keep the other side of the grill off. This will give you a 2-zone setup., Place your steaks on the side of the grill that doesn't have coals underneath it. Grill the steaks until they come about 10 degrees lower than the overall temperature you want. For example, if you want the steaks to be finished around 130 degrees F (55 C) for medium rare, cook the steaks over indirect heat until they're at 120 degrees F (49 C). This will allow the meat to slowly come up to the proper temperature.You'll need to use an instant read thermometer to monitor the temperature of the steak.
 When the internal temperature of the meat is almost where you'd like it, use tongs to carefully move the steaks to the side of the grill with the coals. Grill the steaks over direct heat for several minutes so the outsides char and seal in the flavor.You can turn the steaks while you're finishing them. If you turn them slightly, you'll be able to make hash marks.
 Take the temperature of the steaks to determine if they're to your liking. Once they're at the right temperature, take the steaks off of the grill and set them on a serving plate. Let them sit for 10 minutes before you slice and serve the steaks. This will allow the juices redistribute within the meat. Use these temperatures as guidelines:Rare: 120 to 130 degrees F (49 to 54 C)
Medium-rare: 130 to 140 degrees F (54 to 60 C)
Medium: 140 to 150 degrees F (60 to 66 C)
Medium-well: 150 to 160 degrees F (66 to 71 C)
Well: 160 to 170 degrees F (71 to 77 C)

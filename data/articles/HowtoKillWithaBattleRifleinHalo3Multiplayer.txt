 Don't aim for the head when using a BR. The spread pattern makes it bad to aim there. Instead aim for the neck all the shots will the hit the head.;
, DO NOT NOOB COMBO!!! If you know don't know what noob-comboing is its when you shoot a fully charged Plasma Pistol shot at someone and the head shot with a BR. This will make people hate you and it makes your gamer rating VERY low because everyone avoids you. Instead of noob-comboing try throwing grenades

, This is a perfectly acceptable way to kill.
 Dodging simplified down to basics involves strafing,jumping, and reversing direction. Strafing is when you move left or right now add jumping to this. Your best bet is to add jumps randomly I'll try to demonstrate with a pattern S is strafe J is jump. S_J_S_S_S_S_J_S_J_S_S_J: This provides a good slap in your opponents face trying to change the aiming of their BR. Now reversing direction is always a good way to help too it makes your opponent have to turn around to get to you. So again a pattern except now we add R for direction change. S_S_J_S_S_S_S_J_R_S_J_R_S_S_S_S_J. So now your opponent has to turn around 3 times to get to you

, No scoping on a BR is much different from NS sniping. No scoping on a BR involves aiming at you opponents body NOT their head unless your VERY close.

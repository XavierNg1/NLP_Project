 Make sure the water is between 23 and 29 degrees Celsius or between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit and there is a light before adding the eggs. Put a piece of black paper behind the tank. If you bought a kit and it came with detritus (eggs), follow the instructions and add this.;
, After this time, look closely at the tank. You should be able to see little white specks swimming over the black background. Some of these are your triops! The other creatures (Fairy Shrimp, Cyclops, Water Fleas etc.) will probably be eaten by the triops, so don't worry.
 After that waiting period, you can raise the water temperature to 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit)and have them on a day/night schedule. Feed them the food the kit gave you or use tropical fish pellets, not goldfish pellets. Crush them between two spoons, then add half of this to the tank.
 At 7 days and over, feed them a full pellet to each triops 2-3 times a day. Keep feeding till they don't eat anymore, then take out the excess food they don't eat.

 Place a small strainer over a small tea bowl and measure out the matcha powder into it. If you do not have a matcha scoop, measure out 3 teaspoons (4 grams) of matcha. Gently tap the side of the strainer to sift the tea into the bowl. This will break up any clumps and give you a smoother matcha in the end.


Koicha is a thicker type of matcha tea.
 Do not pour the hot water into the tea bowl with the matcha just yet.


Make sure that you use filtered water or spring water.Ordinary tap water contains too many minerals which may affect the flavor of the tea.
 Do not pour in all of the water all at once, or it will cause the tea to clump up., A chasen is a delicate, bamboo whisk made specifically for preparing matcha tea.Do not use a metal fork or whisk as this will affect the flavor and aroma of the tea. Keep stirring until the matcha is dissolved into a thick paste.
 Use your chasen again and half-circular motions. Keep stirring until the matcha paste thins out. It won't be thin like Usucha, but thicker and darker.
 If you wait too long, the matcha powder will settle to the bottom of the cup.

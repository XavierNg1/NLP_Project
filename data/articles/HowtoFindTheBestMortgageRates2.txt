 Banks, credit unions, online lenders, and other financial institutions can provide estimates of mortgages. This will give you a good idea of what the market is currently like, and it will help you learn what kind of rates you are eligible for.


Meet with banks and financial institutions you have worked with previously. If you are a current customer, they might be more willing to offer you a great mortgage rate in order to keep you as a customer.
Banks have higher interest rates and fees, but you may have an easier time negotiating for a lower rate with them. Credit unions, on the other hand, usually charge lower interest rates and fees, but they may only lend to people in a certain geographic area, industry, or organization.Online lenders tend to have low rates and fees, but they have less customer support. You should be very careful, as there are more scams online.Be wary of online lenders who are registered in a different country or do not provide a mailing address. In addition, always be cautious of lenders who promise that bad credit does not matter., If you are frustrated working directly with multiple lenders, you might consider hiring a mortgage broker. A broker can shop around for good mortgage rates on your behalf. While you will have to pay them for this service, you may save in the long run, as brokers may be able to find you lower rates.


Broker fees are usually between one and two percent of the total loan. These charges may be listed as origination fees, document fees, or processing fees.
In addition to broker fees, you will have to pay third party and government fees for property appraisal, title transfer, and other processes. A reputable broker will inform you about these fees upfront. If a broker does not tell you about third party or government fees, they may be trying to make you think that their service is less expensive than it really is.You might look to see if the mortgage broker is certified by the National Association of Mortgage Brokers., If you are struggling to find a good rate, you can look to government institutions for a mortgage. These programs are often marketed towards lower income families or middle class buyers.

, When looking for mortgage rates, you might encounter aggressive or predatory lenders. If an interest rate looks too good to be true, it probably is. Read the fine on any contract carefully, and ask a lawyer to help you if needed.


Never sign a contract that has blank, unfilled spaces in it.
In some cases, you will notice that there are extremely low interest rates upfront but that after a certain point, the rates balloon. Avoid this.
If you notice clause in the contract that waives your right to sue the lender, do not sign it. This is sometimes called “mandatory arbitration” in a contract.If a borrower tries to convince you that you will not be able to find a loan elsewhere, they may be trying to pressure you into signing a bad loan. Furthermore, some might try to pressure you to sign something on the spot by stating the rate will expire immediately. This is an aggressive tactic, and you should not give in., In addition to your interest rate, you may have to pay extra fees. If you get a good rate but have to pay excessive fees, you will not save much money. When shopping around for rates, pay attention to:



Origination fees: these are the fees your lender or broker will charge you for creating the loan.

Discount Points: these points help you pay the interest for the loan ahead of time. By paying these upfront, you can reduce your interest.Closing costs: these are the fees you pay to transfer the deed. They are usually 3% of the house price.Attorney fees: some lenders might ask you to pay their attorney fees. You should ask them to remove these fees as it could be a conflict of interest.

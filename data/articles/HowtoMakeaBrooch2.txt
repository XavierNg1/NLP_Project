 The large one will be the base of your brooch and attach all the smaller pins.
 The size or shape of the bead doesn't matter, so long as it isn't so small that it won't go on the pin or so large that it keeps the pin from closing.


Pinch the end of the safety pin with jewelry pliers; this ensures the pin won't accidentally open and spill the beads.
Repeat adding beads and pinching for the remaining small safety pins.
 String all small safety pins with beads along the length of the large safety pin. You now have a dangly brooch that can adorn any outfit.


Wear the handmade brooch on a coat lapel, scarf, hat, or handbag.

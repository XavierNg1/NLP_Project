The United States country code is always 1, no matter where you're calling from.
 All area codes in the United States are three digits long, and mobile phones are usually assigned to the area code where service was first established.


If a person moves and retains cell phone service, the cell phone's area code does not change. So one person might have a cell phone and a fixed phone line with two different area codes.
Toll-free numbers also have a three-digit prefix, although the prefixes are not location-specific. Toll-free prefixes in the United States include 800, 888, 877 and 866.

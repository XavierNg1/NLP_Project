 This is used for dress slacks and other pants, and is especially helpful in determining the best length to search for. Remember to take your shoes' heel height into account. Enlist the help of a friend if you can, or if no one's around to help, select your best fitting pair of jeans to measure your inseam.


Measure the inside leg. Ask your friend to use a tape measure to measure the length of your leg from your ankle up to the bottom of your crotch. You should be standing with your leg straight while this is done.
If you're using a pair of jeans, extend the tape measure from the bottom hem straight up to the lowest point of the crotch area.
Record the measurement. Round the number up to the nearest half-inch and mark it down on paper.
 This measurement is most often used for stockings and custom-made pants.


Stand in front of a mirror with your legs slightly apart.
Wrap a tape measure around the thickest part of your thigh. Keep it parallel to the floor and taut, but do not pull so tight that it digs into your flesh.
Bring the ends together in the front of your thigh.
Record the measurement. Read the number using the mirror or by looking down while keeping your leg and the tape measure still. Mark the number down on paper.
 This measurement is typically used for certain types of formal trousers.


Stand in front of a mirror with your back straight and your feet and legs slightly apart.
Hold the end of the tape measure at the center back of your natural waist.
Gently and loosely pull the tape between your legs and over your crotch, keeping the other end positioned at the center front of your natural waist.
Look at the measurement in the mirror or by cautiously bending your head down without changing your posture.
Mark the number down on paper.

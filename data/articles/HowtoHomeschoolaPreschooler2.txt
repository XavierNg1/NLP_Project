 Cognitive development skills are important skills to master. These skills include learning and problem solving. Puzzles are a great way to teach your child problem solving skills. Buy an age-appropriate puzzle and help your child figure out how the pieces fit together. As you put the puzzle together, talk to your child about what you see. For example, "This is a pig. Where will the pig fit in the puzzle?"

, Legos are another great way to develop problem solving skills, like how things build on top of each other. Show your child how the Legos fit together first. Then ask them to repeat what you just did. As your child plays with the legos, ask them to identify the colors of the Legos as they put them together., Colored blocks are a great way to teach your child cognitive skills, like learning to match shapes. Ask your child to organize the blocks by shape or by color. You can practice by showing your child how to organize the blocks based on shape or color first. Then, ask your child to repeat the process. You can also ask your child to name the shapes as they group them together.

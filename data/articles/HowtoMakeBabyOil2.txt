 Coconut oil is not recommended for this method, since there won’t be any heat applied to melt it and combine it with the herbs. Otherwise, you can use any other base oil that is in liquid form at room temperature, like almond, olive, or apricot oil.


Choose any dried herbs or fragrance oils that you’d like to infuse into the oil.
 Mason jars are best since the lid gives you a tight seal, but any glass bottle or jar with a lid is fine. Measure 2-4 tablespoons of herbs into your container and then pour one cup (about .25 liters) of your base oil over the herbs. If you’re adding fragrance or essential oil, put in a few drops and then seal the jar., A porch or deck is the perfect spot if you have one. Otherwise, use a windowsill that gets lots of sun., Once the herbs have been infusing the oil for a few weeks, it's time to remove them. Strain them out using a mesh colander or piece of cheesecloth as you pour the oil into another jar or bottle.Put a lid on your jar of baby oil and store it in a cool, dry place for up to 6-9 months.

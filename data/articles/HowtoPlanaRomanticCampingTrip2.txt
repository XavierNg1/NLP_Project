 Plan to get up early before your significant other. Prepare breakfast as they sleep. Make sure to be quiet – if you need to go to a neighboring (empty) campsite, you should. Then, surprise your significant other with breakfast in bed.Cook their favorite foods, whatever that is.
Consider serving eggs, pancakes or rocky mountain toast, bacon, fresh fruit, and coffee.
 Pack a complete picnic, start out on a trail, and look for a scenic and romantic place to have lunch. Take your time, though. There is no rush. Use this opportunity to spend time with your loved one and find the perfect spot to enjoy your meal. When packing your lunch, make sure to bring:


Sandwiches
Some snack food
Tea or lemonade
A bottle of wine (if you’re not too far from camp)

, Whether you have a picnic table, a foldout camping table, or just the ground, use the opportunity to have a candlelit dinner under the stars. Spread a blanket on the floor (or on a table) and set up your candles, napkins, and silverware. Then, either cook for your partner or cook together.


Compliment your meal with a bottle of wine.
Follow your dinner by roasting marshmallows or making s'mores.

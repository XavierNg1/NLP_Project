 Use the examples below as "milestones" to help you estimate the size of a hexadecimal number. This will give you a more intuitive understanding of hexadecimal, and let you read hexadecimal numbers without laboriously converting to decimal every time. As you'll see, one advantage to hexadecimal is that the number of digits doesn't increase nearly as fast as it does in decimal:


Humans have A fingers, or 1416 if you count the toes too. (Remember, the subscript 16 means a number is written in base sixteen.)
In a residential area, drive below 1916 miles per hour (or 2816 kilometers per hour).
A typical highway driving speed is 3C mph (or 6416 kph).
Water boils at D4 ºFahrenheit (6416 º Celsius).
The median U.S. income is roughly C350 dollars a year.
The population of the world is over 1A0,000,000.
 You can do hexadecimal addition problems without ever converting to another system. It does take some mental effort and practice to remember the new rules. Here are a few methods and tips:


Count up one by one, using hexadecimal digits. For instance to solve 7+5 in hex, count 7, 8, 9, A, B, C.
Learn the addition tables. A much faster method is to memorize the hexadecimal addition tables, which you can practice with an online quiz.Once you know that A + 7 = 1116, you don't have to laboriously count it out any more.
Carry the one when needed. If your addition gets you past F, you "carry the one" as you would in a normal addition problem. For example, A+5 = F, A+6 = 1016, A+7 = 1116, and so on. Similarly, 3A+6 = 4016, 3A+7 = 4116, etc.
 Just like regular multiplication, the best way to become competent at hexadecimal multiplication is to memorize the multiplication tables. Here's the hex "6 times table" as an example (all numbers are hexadecimal):


6 x 1 = 6
6 x 2 = C
6 x 3 = 12
6 x 4 = 18
6 x 5 = 1E
6 x 6 = 24
6 x 7 = 2A
6 x 8 = 30
6 x 9 = 36
6 x A = 3C
6 x B = 42
6 x C = 48
6 x D = 4E
6 x E = 54
6 x F = 5A

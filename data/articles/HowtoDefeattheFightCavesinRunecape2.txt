 Magic is by far the easiest way to defeat the fight caves, as almost all of the monster's weaknesses in the fight cave is magic. You are going to want at least 70 magic before attempting the fight caves. Buy 2 super magic potions (or extreme if you can make them). 2 prayer renewal flasks, 5 prayer flasks, 8 saradomin brew flasks, 8 super restore flasks, and runes for your casts. You are going to want to use Water blast, or if you have Ancient Magicks unlocked, use ice burst or barrage. Buy yourself Ahrim's set as your armour, Keep the 3 protection prayers near the end of the bar, and have your abilities as Combust, Sonic Wave, Dragon Breath, Chain, Impact, and Wrack

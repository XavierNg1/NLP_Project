 Lay your shirt on a flat surface, such as a bed or table, with the front of the shirt facing the ceiling. Make sure the shirt is smooth and flat as well., Invert and fold up the bottom three to four inches (76 to 102 mm) of your shirt to make a cuff. At this point, the bottom section of your shirt should look like a sleeve that has been folded up., Fold either the right or left side inwards toward the middle of the shirt. It should line up with the middle of the shirt. Then fold the sleeve backward to make it line up with the shirt as well., Take the other side and fold it inwards and on top of the first side. In other words, make sure to overlap the first side with the second side. Also fold the sleeve backward so everything lines up.At this point, your shirt should look like a vertical rectangle.
 Starting at the top, roll the shirt toward the bottom until it is fully rolled. Make sure to roll the shirt tightly. The tighter the roll, the more compact the shirt will be., Remember the cuff you formed in the beginning? Use this to tuck the shirt to form the burrito. Turn the rolled shirt over to locate the cuff. Fold the cuff over the rest of the shirt to form the burrito.

 Once you have decided on a degree, it is time to choose the school where you get it. When comparing schools, you may want to consider:


The cost of tuition. Most schools will provide this information on their website. If you cannot locate it on the website, call the financial aid department and ask.
Available resources. Think about the resources available at each school. Is the school nearby, so that you can visit the campus if you need assistance with anything? Does the school offer job placement services upon graduation?
What current and former students say. You can find reviews written by students who have experience with the colleges you are considering at websites such as Student Reviewand College Prowler.
What independent reviewers say. Several websites offer school rankings and detailed information about each college ranked. Try U.S. News Best Colleges, Forbes Best Colleges List, and Open Education Database.
 Most colleges now accept online applications, which you can find by visiting the school’s website. Locate your school’s online application and print a hard copy. Complete the application and, if applicable, submit your application fee.
 All U.S. college or university students must fill out a FAFSA each year. You can complete the FAFSA onlineor download a printable version. After completing the FAFSA, you will receive a report describing each type of Federal financial aid available to you. You may then accept or reject each loan or grant offer.
 Once you are accepted at a school, you will receive an acceptance letter in the mail, and possibly via e-mail. Follow any instructions included in the letter or any informational packet mailed with it.

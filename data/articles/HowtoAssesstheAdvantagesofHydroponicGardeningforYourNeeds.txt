, You can grow more plants into a smaller area with indoor hydroponics gardening. This is despite your actual plants being larger, the roots are smaller as they don’t need to expand to find nutrients.


You can grow the plants anywhere; window ledge, rooftop, attic, basement, bedroom, garage, conservatory or greenhouse.
As you don’t need a garden for hydroponics, you’ll be at no disadvantage if you live in the city in a crowded apartment block. Even if you live in the desert, the arctic or outer space!

, Maintenance time is greatly reduced! Weeding doesn’t exist without the soil and there is no need to water hydroponic plants. In fact all you really need to do is pick them as and when required.
 The yield is year round! This is because you will have manipulated the growing conditions to be optimum for whatever you’re growing! This is great for off season periods as you could sell them for higher prices.
 Indoor hydroponics gardening will result in plants around 40% larger! This is due to them being in their ideal environment and having access to all the nutrients they need.


Hydroponic plants will grow around 50% faster than their soil based counterparts! This is great for feeding large families and or for making profit.
 A common mistake made by many novice gardeners is under and over watering. As you don’t need to water hydroponic plants, this problem is eliminated.

 There is no drug licensed for the treatment of coccidiosis in cats. This means that any drug used to treat coccidiosis is "off label", or that the drug you are using is not specifically designed for what you are using it for. The most effective, first choice treatment is a prescription for sulfonamide antibiotics.


You will need a prescription for these antibiotics from your catâ€™s vet. When you meet with him or her, talk about other potential options.;
, The effect of these sulphonamide antibiotics is dose dependent. At higher doses they are coccidiocidal (meaning they kill protozoa) and at lower doses they are a coccidiostat (meaning they stop the protozoa from breeding). Cats are most commonly prescribed a potentiated form of sulphonamide that contains sulfadiazine potentiated (activated) by trimethoprim. You will most likely give the cat this medication for six days.


The dose is generally 15 to 30 mg per kg of weight. You will most likely give your cat a divided dose twice a day for six days. At the lower end of this dose range (15 mg/kg) a 5 kg cat would receive a half a 80 mg Trimacare tablet, twice a day., Sulfonamide drugs are metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys. In animals with liver or kidney damage, the dose should be towards the lower end of the dose range. This is because the organs have a reduced ability to get rid of the drug and so it tends to accumulate in the blood stream.


Giving a full dose can result in toxicity issues such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. A reduced dose of 7.5 mg/kg once daily is appropriate.

 Under most circumstances, adults who have been medically diagnosed with low testosterone levels can safely increase their levels, and natural methods can be some of the healthiest ways to do so. That being said, you should avoid intentionally increasing your testosterone if you are still an adolescent or if you’re an adult with normal or undiagnosed levels.


Testosterone levels are usually highest during your adolescent years, but since your hormones fluctuate regularly during this time of your life, it's best to let them naturally adjust themselves rather than attempting to change them yourself.If you're concerned about low testosterone as a teenager, consult with your doctor before making any changes.
Increasing testosterone when your levels are already normal can negatively impact your health, even as an adult. For women, high testosterone may lead to polycystic ovarian syndrome, infertility, obesity, and thinning hair, among other problems.There's some debate regarding how harmful high testosterone can be for men, but some research suggests that excessively high levels can increase a man's risk of cardiovascular disease., If you have no known health concerns other than low testosterone, most herbal supplements should be relatively safe to try on a short-term basis. Certain medical conditions may make these herbal remedies dangerous, however, so you may wish to avoid using herbs to increase testosterone if you have known health concerns.


For women, avoid most herbal supplements if you are (or might be) pregnant or if you're currently breastfeeding. Tribulus, ashwagandha, ginkgo, and yohimbe are all considered unsafe under these conditions.
For men, tribulus might be linked to prostate problems.Ashwagandha may cause problems in people with diabetes, low blood pressure, stomach ulcers, auto-immune diseases, and thyroid disorders.Ginkgo may cause an allergic reaction if you're allergic to urushiols, like poison ivy and cashews. It could also cause problems if you have blood pressure irregularities, diabetes, hypoglycemia, gastro-intestinal disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, nervous system disorders, seizures, skin disorders, psychiatric disorders, or heart disease.Yohimbe is dangerous if you suffer from bleeding conditions, schizophrenia, prostate problems, PTSD, liver disease, kidney disease, blood pressure irregularities, heart disease, anxiety, depression, or diabetes., If you're not currently on any medications, most herbal remedies are likely safe to use. You may need to avoid these remedies if you're currently on medications that could interact with them, however.


Avoid tribulus if you're on blood pressure medication, diabetes medications, or steroids.Ashwagandha may be dangerous if you're on immunosuppressants or sedative medications.Ginkgo could negatively interact with heart disease agents, seizure medications, anticholinergic agents, antidepressants, and CYP450-metabolized agents.Avoid yohimbe if you take or may take MAOIs, clonidine, guanabenz, tricyclic antidepressants, antihypertensive drugs, naloxone, phenothiazines, or stimulant drugs., As long as you do not have conditions or medications that may cause complications, testosterone herbal remedies are likely safe for adults when taken for six months or less.


Beyond six months, some herbal remedies may result in complications like excessive bleeding,stomach upset, diarrhea, and vomiting.Difficulty sleeping may also be a result., While moderate amounts of vitamin D and zinc can help your body produce more testosterone and stay healthy, excessive amounts of either nutrient can actually be toxic. It's usually best to get both nutrients from natural sources, but if you choose to take supplemental forms, simply make sure you follow the dosing instructions provided on the label.


The recommended dietary allowance of vitamin D is 600 IU (international units) daily. Toxicity usually occurs in people who regularly take around 50,000 IU for several months, but this amount may be smaller for individuals with liver problems, kidney problems, or other health concerns.For zinc, the recommended daily allowance is between 8 and 11 mg daily in adults.The upper limit is about 40 mg daily, and toxicity typically occurs when individuals regularly intake more than this upper limit., Making healthier diet and exercise choices can be a great idea, even if you don't need to increase your testosterone levels. To get the most benefit out of your improved lifestyle while minimizing any possible risks, see your doctor before implementing any major changes.


In addition to testing your testosterone levels and notifying you of any personal health limitations, your doctor can work with you to determine the best treatment possible. Your doctor may suggest medical remedies, but don't be afraid to let your doctor know if you strongly wish to stick with natural methods. As long as it doesn’t present a threat to your health, most doctors will be willing to work out a strategy according to your wishes.

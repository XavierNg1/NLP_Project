 If you're a member of the Builder's Club, you earn a certain amount of robux a day. You also earn them in game, and can buy them in bundles from Roblox. This is your currency in the Catalog.


Builder's club members can sell old shirts, hats, etc. and keep 70% of the profits.
If you develop games on Roblox, you can use ads to make some in-game cash., There is a button on the top, blue rail that brings you to the catalog. You'll be able to browse by type of customization.
 Once you've purchased something, find and equip it by going to the menu (3-green lines), then "Character." From here you can equip your new stuff.

 The single most effective way to celebrate recovery is to maintain it. Dealing with a mental health condition or addiction is challenging. Any small change in your daily life can trigger a relapse. So, do what you can to stay on top of your recovery by continuing your treatment.;
, Whether it’s been a week since you had a drink or you’re celebrating six months purge-free, you shouldn’t wait until a major milestone to reward yourself. Do so daily in some small way.Most people in recovery keep a count of their progress in days. Each morning when you wake up, you might smile and say, “Hello, day number sixteen.”

, Another practical way to track progress in recovery is with a personal journal. You can use your journal however you like—to document your mood, describe changes in your physical health, or briefly notate the events that transpired that day.Such journals are helpful at spotting behavioral and mood patterns in your functioning. Plus, this journal can be useful in letting your doctor or mental health provider understand where you are in recovery.
You may even consider putting a calendar on the wall and crossing off the days to see your progress and help you to stay motivated.
 Thanks to modern technology, you can easily document your recovery with a few quick swipes on your smartphone. Similar to a paper journal, you can jot down noteworthy aspects about your treatment and recovery. However, there are also phone apps that offer relaxation exercises, self-help coping tools, thought-stopping techniques, and social support. Try eCBT Calm and Optimism.

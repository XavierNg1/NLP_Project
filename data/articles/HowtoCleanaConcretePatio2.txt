 Pour the vinegar and water into a large bucket in equal quantities and stir them together. Vinegar is naturally acidic, and can help lift and dissolve stains from within the shallow pores of the concrete better than water alone. Use a ratio of two parts vinegar to one part water if your patio has been affected by moss or mildew growth.If you don’t happen to have vinegar on hand, the same concentration of hydrogen peroxide should also do the trick.For slightly heavier or more persistent grime, add half a cup of baking soda to the vinegar solution.
 Slosh the contents of the bucket directly over the surface of the patio. Making sure to cover as much area as you can so that the vinegar will be able to clean the concrete evenly.Apply the solution liberally. Vinegar isn’t damage concrete, so you won’t have to worry about accidentally using too much.
It may be necessary to mix up more solution if you’re cleaning a particularly large area.
 While vinegar makes an effective natural cleaner, it is relatively mild, which means it will take time to work. The solution will gradually seep down into the concrete, breaking up trapped and solidified dirt.Plan your cleaning project for a day with good weather to reduce the chances that unexpected rainfall will wash away the vinegar.
Make better use of your time by tackling other household cleaning and maintenance tasks while the concrete is soaking.
 After a few hours have passed, you’ll most likely notice that the vinegar has whisked away the worst of the mess. If any traces of dirt or discoloration remain, work them out by hand using a stiff-bristled push broom. Afterwards, hose off the patio once again and let it dry completely before replacing your belongings.You can also use an abrasive sponge to scour your patio with a little extra elbow grease.
Avoid using wire scrubbers on concrete, as these can scratch or mark up smooth surfaces.

 This will make your hair smoother and have less knots, which will make it much easier to separate strands of hair.;
,, Take one of the two and start wrapping the strands around the bobby pin creating a spirals identical to a spring. The bobby pin should be closed. It's okay to have a few hairs leftover.
 Slide the spirals on the bobby into the other to keep it there. If you have thinner hair you can use small elastics about the size of a rainbow loom band and tie it onto the curls instead of using another bobby pin.
 The final product will look a little bit like how you would look like if you did it with hair rollers.
 (You can also add hairspray for a finishing touch.) It should look like natural wavy hair or a bit like a wavy bob if rushed.

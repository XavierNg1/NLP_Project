 With the exception of lower priced items, every item shipped to the store for upcoming floor sets need to have a sensor put on them. This includes, but is not limited to, denim, button-downs, skirts, purses, etc.
 Keeping items in their designated locations in the Stockroom will make replenishing the store easier and more efficient.


Do NOT climb on the stock shelves to put away or grab any product. Step stools, known as Little Giants, and ladders are to be used when reaching a higher shelf.

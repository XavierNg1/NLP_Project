 You can’t go overboard here if you’re trying to stay as pale as possible! 30 SPF is the baseline advised by the American Academy of Dermatology, though going higher doesn’t hurt. 









It’s easy to forget about the brief, incidental sun exposure we all incur just going about our daily lives. Remember to apply every day if you’re looking to avoid gaining color; you walk under the same sun when you get your mail as you do when you stroll along the beach.
 Long sleeves may not be too fun in the heat, but you’ll need to cover as much skin as you can while you’re outside. Clouds make very little difference in the sun’s effect on your skin, too, blocking a mere 20% of UV rays. And if you thought you were safe on the ski slopes, think again: snow actually reflects 80% of UV rays, increasing exposure. So if you were planning on skiing shirtless for some reason… maybe don’t.
 Admittedly, you might feel a little silly at first, but it’s a surefire way to block out the sun during your walk down the block. Consider a parasol if you’re looking for something a little more chic.



Don’t entrust it all to an umbrella at the beach, however. As you might’ve guessed after learning of snow’s powerful reflective potential, sand, too, reflects UV rays. Not as bad as snow—only 17% from sand—but still enough for the sun to make its mark. , When it comes down to it, staying inside will keep you the palest. Full-on hermit life isn’t an option for everyone, though, and keep in mind it’s not a requirement to keeping your skin lighter if you can abide by the above steps.



The body does requires Vitamin D, though, and nutritional guidelines for vitamin D (600 IU from ages 1-70) are generally set with the assumption that a person will be receiving some regular sunlight. Fatty fish, beef liver, eggs, cheese, and mushrooms provide some vitamin D, and U.S. milk is often fortified with it.

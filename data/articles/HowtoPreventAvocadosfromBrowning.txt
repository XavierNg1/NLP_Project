 They will be able to be cut open and used that day. If you're planning not to use them right away buy firmer avocados and let them sit on your counter for a few days to ripen up. If they are ripening too quickly, refrigerate them.;
, Roll your knife around it to get two halves. If you're only going to use half of the avocado don't take the seed out. This will prevent less air coming in contact with that side of the avocado. Less air means less browning since it has less surface area to react. Use the half that doesn't have the pit.
 Use saran wrap right against the avocado. This is the best way to prevent browning. With fewer air pockets, the avocado browns slower.
 If you're planning to use both sides of the avocado, remove the seed. Add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of lemon or lime juice. Lowering the pH on the surface deactivates the enzymes and the air won't react with a low pH.
 Once wrapped, either store in a tight fit container or wrap again to prevent an extra layer to prevent browning.
 The longer the exposed avocado is left out the quicker it will brown. They will generally last around 3-4 days in the refrigerator.

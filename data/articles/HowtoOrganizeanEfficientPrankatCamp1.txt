 The guinea pig has to be the stealthiest person in the group. He/she is the one that goes into the area that you are going to prank and checks to make sure that:


A. Nobody is awake/inside
B. There isn't anything in the way of the prank's success

The guinea pig should try to establish some form of inaudible communication, like a hand gesture or something of the sort which could indicate "don't go in" or "it's safe."

;
, He/she has to be fast and discreet while doing the prank, and be bold and skilled in the ways of practical joke-dom. There can be more than one frontman. The frontman continues on with the prank without hesitation, unless somebody sees him/her, or a flank tells him to stop.
 The flank always follows the frontman closely and looks out to see whether anyone is coming. There is always the golden rule of at least one flank to every frontman. If one person is found out, the whole prank is ruined, so make sure that they have your back.

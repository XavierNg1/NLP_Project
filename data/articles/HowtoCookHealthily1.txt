 Fruit juice and dried fruit, when used in moderation, is a healthy addition to many meals. Cook a dish like Moroccan chicken with dried plums to boost the fiber content of the dish, or use freshly squeezed orange juice to give a citrus kick to a salad dressing.
 Applesauce is a great substitute for vegetable oil in muffin and bread recipes. You’ll have to do some research to calculate just how much fat you can replace with fruit in your recipes, but the fruit can add the same moisture to your dishes without making your fingers greasy, so it’s worth it.

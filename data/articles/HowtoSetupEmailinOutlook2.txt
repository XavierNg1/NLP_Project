 This allows you to log in to your email account, setting it up for Outlook.



Troubleshooting: For Windows 8 or higher: If you are not getting this option, then get the “Charms bar” by pressing combined “Window + C” with the keyboard. At the Charms bar, click over “Settings,” then “Accounts,” and then “Add an account”.
 There is a little "+" near the corner on some Macs.



Troubleshooting: You may also need to click the padlock icon in the bottom to unlock your settings. This will require your administrative password, the one you used to log into the computer.
 If asked what kind of account (Gmail, Yahoo Mail, etc.) make sure you select the correct one.
 It may take some time to access your email, but usually no more than a few minutes., This is by far the most common way to work things.



Troubleshooting: If this fails, try POP.
 This is what you used to log on.
 This looks complicated, but it is not. Simply write in mail, a period, then the end of your email handle. For example, if your email is Youperson@gmail.com, your servers would both be mail.gmail.com.


Make sure "Use SSL to connect" is checked., This helps keep Outlook running smoothly, and is not strictly necessary. It will, however, help avoid some common issues.

 A cargobob is a military helicopter that you can find at two main locations: on the helipads inside Fort Zancudo or from Warstock Cache and Carry, where you can purchase one.

At certain levels, you can find a cargobob at the Elysian Island helipad. Elysian Island is an industrial district in the Port of Lost Santos.;
, Fly to Fort Zancudo and pick up your desired tank, keeping in mind that stealing the tank will draw the attention of military personnel at the fort. Stealing a tank separated from the rest and close to the edges of the fort might save you from taking lethal damage.

If you have not already attended flight school and are not confident in your abilities as a pilot, the San Adreas Flight School Academy opens at the Los Santos International Airport after you complete scouting the port.Practice flying here.
 While controlling the cargobob, it should be easy to fly to location out of sight and difficult for non-player characters to access. Once you have lost the cops, you can take possession of your tank., Lower your cargobob so that the tank is touching the ground. Release the tank, then land your cargobob and proceed immediately to the tank. Press the button prompted for taking command of the vehicle, and commence your reign of terror.

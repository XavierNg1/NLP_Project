 You can create your hickey on any part of your body, but hickeys are usually found on the neck and chest areas.
 Alcohol activated paint is used commonly for film and theatre use because they are sweat resistance and last a long time.Grease paints are an alternative option, but they have a tendency to not last as long and melt a bit, due to body heat., Open a bottle of rubbing alcohol and apply a cotton ball to the open top. Tip the bottle upside for one second, then flip it back, right-side up. Squeeze the soaked cotton ball over the middle of a paint plate to create a small puddle of alcohol.


This small pool of alcohol will be what you dip your applicator sponges in to moisten them, activating the paint.
 Tap the stippled edge of the applicator sponge in the alcohol. Then squeeze the stippled edge of the sponge to distribute the alcohol. Dab the stippled edge of the sponge on a paper towel to absorb any excess alcohol.


Be sure to stand in front of a mirror as you get ready to create your hickey.
 Gently tap the dampened applicator sponge into the red paint color.Lightly dab a corner of the sponge on your skin to create a small oval approximately ½ inch long and ¼ wide.


Stipple the coloring as much as you can. The stippled look will make the hickey look natural and authentic.
 With the same sponge applicator, dab the sponge into the dark blue color. The red from the previous application mixed with the blue will create a very bruise-like purple color.Dab the sponge into the center of the hickey very lightly to give the appearance of broken blood vessels.To help blend the colors together, you can tap the sponge into the alcohol, tap a paper towel to remove excess alcohol, and dab the hickey, allowing the colors to blend into each other.

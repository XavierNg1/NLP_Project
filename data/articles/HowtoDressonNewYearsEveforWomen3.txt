 If you already have a sparkly dress, keep things simple with a solid yet colorful hue on your fingers. On the other hand, a glitter nail polish works well with your little black dress or solid color ensemble.
 Apply a little blush or bronzer to the apples of your cheeks to bring color and life back to your skin.
 Layer on dark eyeliner and mascara before brushing various shades of gray, brown or black shadow over your lids. Incorporate a little color by selecting a colored eyeshadow in a deep, rich shade.
 Many women may hesitate to wear red lipstick, but most can find a shade that flatters their skin tone with enough searching. Red lipstick adds drama and makes a statement, which makes it the perfect addition to an eye-catching New Yearâ€™s Eve outfit.
 Look for an eyeshadow or lipstick previously infused with glitter, or brush a light coating of glitter dust over your cheeks or along your collarbone. Do not overdo it, though. Pick one feature to accentuate with glitter and only apply a light amount.

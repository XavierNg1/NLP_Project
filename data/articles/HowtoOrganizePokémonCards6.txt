 Organizing cards by rarity is another good method for collectors to use, as it organizes cards by relative financial value. This will make it easier for you to evaluate the worth of your card collection. Gather all cards of similar rarity into groups together.


Symbols in the bottom right corner of the card will indicate its rarity. A circle represents common cards, diamond uncommon, and star rare., You might use an alphabetic, national Pok√©dex number, or HP (hit point) system to further organize your rare card groups. If you are a player and collector, you may find that separating your rare card groupings into type, then arranging types by number or alphabetic order, works best., You'll probably want to separate binders, boxes, or drawers to keep different rarity groupings separate. An alternative to this would be to store your cards in your container and then use tabs to create sections for the different varieties of rare card.Even if you're using box-sleeves, you may want to keep your rare cards on hand so you can show these off to friends and other collectors. To keep your rare cards visible, you could put your rare cards in a binder that has plastic inserts with pockets for your cards.
To further protect rare cards, you might want to encase each in a special plastic card sleeve intended to keep rare cards pristine. These protectors will be 2.5 in. by 3.5 in. (64mm by 89mm) in size, and can be bought at your local hobby store.

 The MORS is the weapon of choice for most snipers, being the only bolt action sniper in the game, however the Lynx and Atlas 40mm are both viable options as well, even with these semi-automatics, one shot kills are not hard to find.;
, This one is up to preference, if you plan on using your sights a lot, or "hardscoping", then Ballistics CPU would probably be a safe bet. However if you plan to quickscope, then the sight of your choice would be best, or if you don't need a sight, then again Ballistics CPU would be good.
 The first perk is up to you, Flak Jacket is a good option if you are playing objective-based games, but can be substituted for other perks if wanted. For the second and third perks, Fast Hands and Toughness are a must, and should only practically be substituted if you can make up for it elsewhere.
 The lethals, exo abilities, score streaks, and secondaries don't immediately affect your sniping, so this comes right down to whatever you like to have, some snipers like to have a secondary to finish of hitmarkers while others like spike drones to go for trickshots.

 Open System Preferences and select Desktop & Screensaver, followed by the Desktop tab.
 The drop-down menu above the image pane sets the position of the image on the screen. Here's how each option works:


Fill screen: Enlarges photo until screen is covered. This will cut off part of the photo if its size ratio is different from your screen.
Fit to screen: Enlarges photo to fill the height of the screen. Narrow photos will have black borders on either side. Wide photos will have the sides cut off.
Stretch to fill screen: Distorts photo to fill entire screen with no cut offs.
Center: Places photo in center of screen surrounded by a solid color.
Tile: Repeats image in grid to fill screen. In OS 10.7 or later, you can only choose images with resolution lower than your screen.Shrink large images if you want to tile them.
If you choose an option that doesn't fill the screen, a button will appear to the right of the drop-down menu. Click this to change the color of the border.
 Under the image pane, check "Change picture" to cycle between all images in the selected folder. Change how often the picture changes with the drop-down menu.


By default, this will cycle in the order the images are placed in the folder. Check "Random order" to change this.
 Check "Translucent menu bar" if you want the background visible "behind" the top menu bar. Uncheck it if you prefer an opaque bar.


This option is not available for all computers.

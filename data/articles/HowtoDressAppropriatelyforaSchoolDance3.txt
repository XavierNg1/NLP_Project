 Try something just slightly dressier than your everyday clothes. Choose a nice pair of un-ripped dark-wash jeans with a shiny or sparkly top, a denim skirt with a nice blouse, or a light sundress. Just make sure your choices follow the school dress code.


It’s less common to coordinate colors with your date for a casual dance, but you still can if you like!
For a semi-formal dance, find something in between formal and casual wear. Opt for a skirt instead of pants if you’re comfortable wearing one. Or choose a casual dress in a light cotton or other knit rather than something shiny or sparkly.
 Remember that your shoes should be comfortable enough for dancing and being on your feet for several hours. Choose nice sandals, flats, or boots in a color that matches your top or accessories, or in a neutral brown, black, or gray.


Pay attention to dress code guidelines for shoes, which might say sneakers or flip-flops are off-limits.
 Pick a purse or clutch in the same color as your outfit or shoes, or in a neutral brown, black, or gray. Follow any dress code guidelines for jewelry, and keep it simple and classy by sticking to just a few pieces. If you wear big dangly earrings, stick to a simple necklace or bracelet. Or if you have an armful of bangles, choose a less flashy necklace and earrings., Wear makeup to bring out the natural beauty of your face if you like to, but it’s definitely not necessary for a casual dance. Stick with a concealer or foundation that matches your skin tone, and sweep some mascara onto your eyelashes. If you choose to wear dark eyeliner or colorful eyeshadow, stick to a light lip color or gloss. For more colorful lips, keep your eye makeup simpler.

 Button up any buttons that your shirt may have, and then lay your shirt out, facedown, on a flat, sturdy tabletop or similar surface. Straighten the sleeves so they both stick straight out from the shirt’s sides., You can choose either sleeve to begin, but let’s say you start with the right. Fold it across the back of your shirt horizontally so it lays on top of the left sleeve, with the right cuff meeting the left elbow or thereabouts. Stop just before your crease reaches the right collar., When you folded the first sleeve over, a couple inches of your shirt’s front may have folded over the back, too, below the armpit. Straighten this portion if needed while maintaining the fold. Keep your crease along the shirt’s side as straight as possible, from top to bottom., First, take the cuff of your right sleeve and then draw the sleeve back over itself, to the right, horizontally. Stop once the new crease reaches the left collar. Smooth the sleeve out from left to right., The right sleeve’s cuff should now extend a few inches past the original crease at the right collar. Draw the cuff back to the left until the third crease lines up with the first. Smooth the cuff from right to left., Reverse the process and fold your left sleeve horizontally across the back of your shirt, over your folded-up right sleeve. Once you do, straighten the left side of your shirt so its crease runs straight from top to bottom. Then fold the left sleeve over itself two times as you did before, with your left sleeve folding up directly on top of the right one., Draw the bottom of your shirt up and over your sleeves until it meets the bottom of your collar. Smooth it out with your hands. Then flip the shirt over and smooth out the front.

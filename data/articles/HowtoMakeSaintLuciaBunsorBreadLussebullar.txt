 Add the saffron and heat gently.;
, The saffron will continue to infuse in the milk as it cools to a lukewarm temperature. The milk and saffron mix is ready for use at around 95ºF/35ºC.
 Pour in the cooled saffron and milk mix.


Mix the yeast and saffron milk together to dissolve the yeast.
 Mix through well.
 Continue mixing until the dough feels elastic.


Add extra flour to make the dough pliable if needed.
Continue mixing for 10-15 minutes using an electric mixer.
 Place a clean cloth over the bowl (such as a tea towel) or food grade plastic and leave the buns to rise in a warm, draft-free spot. Allow rising for about 45 minutes.
 Remove the dough from the bowl and place on the floured surface. Sprinkle more flour over the dough to make it workable (you can add more as you go).
 This mixture will make about 35 pieces, so pull apart evenly to reach around this number.
 The scrolls should be opposite one another, with one facing to the left, the other facing to the right, when looked at front on.


Roll into a log shape first.
Roll up one end into a scroll that meets at the middle.
Roll up the other end into a scroll that meets in the middle.
 One or two per center of each scroll will suffice.



The buns or breads will brown quickly, so keep a watch on them.
, They are best eaten fresh. Serve with warm drinks.

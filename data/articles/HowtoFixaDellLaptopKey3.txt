 If you cannot find the matching parts within your price range, you can try to replace the key with another key on your keyboard.

Select the key that you want to use as the replacement. You may want to use one of the "Alt" or "Ctrl" keys since the keyboard has 2 of these.
Remove the replacement key from its original place by tugging on it gently.
Raise the key retainer away from the keyboard but don't remove it completely. Make sure the 2 connecting pieces on the back remain attached to the membrane underneath.
Slide a sharp object under the membrane to lift it off the keyboard.

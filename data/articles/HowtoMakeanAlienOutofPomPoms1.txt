 Cut a small round hole in the middle of each circle (see illustration). Lay the circles together, without any overlap.;
, It can then pass easily through the hole in the cardboard.
 Be sure that they are scrunched together as much as possible.


Wrap the first round reasonably tightly around the circle and hold it in place with the next round. Hold it with your fingers until it is secure.






Continue to wind the yarn around and around the circle, keeping the winding even and not leaving gaps.






If using delicate materials such as silk or cotton for an embroidery project, place the thread on a needle and work the thread round using the needle. If it is wool or another heavy yarn that you are using, simply wind using your hands, as it is likely the ring will be wide enough for you to get fingers through.
 Put the scissors in between the two circles of the cardboard and cut open the wound thread or yarn around the outer edge.
 Tie and knot it firmly round the stitches that meet in the centre hole.


Leave sufficiently long ends of thread hanging to form a loop by which the ball can afterwards be fastened to the heading of the fringe.

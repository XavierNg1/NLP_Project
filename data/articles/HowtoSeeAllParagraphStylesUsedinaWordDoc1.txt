, This is the first tab in the toolbar at the top of the screen., The Styles pane will appear on the ride side of the screen, displaying a list of every style in Word., To view a style’s details (such as font size, color, etc.), hover your mouse over its name.

Each style name is preceded by a colored box containing a number.
Colored boxes now also appear along the left side of your document.


For example, if the style “Normal” shows a blue box with a 1, each paragraph using that style will also show a blue box with a 1.
To assign a different style to a paragraph, highlight that paragraph and then click a style in the Styles toolbox.

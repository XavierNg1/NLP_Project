 Make sure to set aside enough time for your stone to cool after you've used it. Never attempt to clean a hot or warm stone. This is important, as cold water could cause a warm or hot stone to crack.

Never pour cool or cold water on a baking stone that has just come out of the oven.;
, Use a nylon scraper to remove all debris from the stone. Slide it down the stone systematically. Pay special attention to any crust, pieces of baked goods, or pizza that might have burned on to the stone.

Make sure the scraper is sharp. You may need to purchase and use a new scraper after you’ve used one a lot.
You can buy a nylon or plastic scraper at a box store or home improvement store., Clean your sink or a basin and fill it with warm water. Slowly slide the stone into the water and allow it to sit. The warm water will loosen any food remnants or other debris on the surface of the stone.

If you can’t submerge the entire stone, make sure to rotate it periodically so the entire stone spends time under water.
Avoid letting the stone sit for too long. If the stone absorbs and retains too much moisture, it could crack next time you put it in the oven., After you've soaked the baking stone, scrub the surface with a cotton cloth. Pay special attention to any debris that may have been leftover after you scraped the stone. Almost all debris should come off after the stone has soaked., Gently place the stone in your sink and rinse it with cool water. Make sure you wash any debris off. If you need to use a cotton cloth to wipe the stone down again, feel free to do so., Before using the stone again, you'll need to make sure that it has dried completely. The best way to do this is to sit the stone out overnight and allow it to dry. That way, when you wake in the morning, your stone will likely be ready to use.

Pat the stone gently with a dry cloth before allowing it to sit overnight.

 The best art comes from conveying your genuine, personal self. However, there are notable benefits from drawing "fan art" (original art based on an established work). Many artists begin by emulating other styles or even tracing professional work. Keep in mind that you should never claim traced/copied work as your own; it should be for practice purposes only. (Practice makes perfect!);
, You can draw inspiration from the work of others.
 It is likely that you know about drawing the "base shapes" of your drawing while continually adding more detail. This is a commonly used method that will probably aid you.
 This could mean drawing it in different styles or with different tools or from different perspectives.
 The possibilities are endless.
 A common criticism is that "it has been done before". If you want to do something that has been done before, then great! Do it, make it your own, and improve. The only time this criticism is valid is when you create something "clich√©d" for the sole purpose of gaining attention. (There is an exception to this: do not draw pornographic or violent material at school or a public institution.)

, Draw in your notebook, on a whiteboard, in the dirt, with chalk, with charcoal, on the computer, with Photoshop, with MS Paint. Draw with your eyes closed, with your off-hand, or even with your foot (Warning: this is hard). Draw the same thing over and over again; it is your work, do whatever the heck you want!

, You will believe everything you tell yourself, whether you realize it or not. Go out of your way to admire what you like about your drawings. Do not compare yourself to others, only to your previous work.

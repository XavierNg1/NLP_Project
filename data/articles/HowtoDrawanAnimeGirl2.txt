 First, sketch a circle for the head. Add an angled shape on the lower part of the circle for the chin and jaw. Use a short line for the neck. Connect a curved line from the neck down to where the pelvis would be located. Draw a four-pointed shape for the thorax and attach more lines for the limbs. Use a triangle as guide for the hands.
 Take note of the proportions and where joints are located. Add a crossed line to the face and thorax to help you determine accurate positioning of body parts later.
 Position it, or, more conventionally them, with the help of the crossed line as outline. Add small curved strokes for the eyebrows. Sketch an angle for the nose and a small curved line for the lips.
 Here in this illustration, it is a simple style that can be achieved by sketching slanted and curved strokes. You can also add a bow or a pin or any accessory on the hair for design.
 School uniforms are a common choice. A simple blazer and pleated skirt would be nice.
, You might want to make it neutral colors, so they look good, not so they clash. The choice is yours though, team orange and purple if you like. It's your drawing.

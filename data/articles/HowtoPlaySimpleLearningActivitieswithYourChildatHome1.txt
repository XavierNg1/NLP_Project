", have lots of common fun and be sure to give mild praise (clap, and say "Yes!") about learning. Don't go gaga (crazy) whether s/he does (or does not) catch on to an idea this time or immediately; so that it's not embarrassing/crushing such as when you or a teacher does not go silly with admiration and joy (keep praise short and mild).


Don't be surprised whether you might see no/or little (or big) signs of comprehension at times.
Never shame or make a big deal; or else, the young child won't be happy. Never make the child's learning disappointing. Lead in simple learning, for commonly learning all the time.
 Activities do not have to be fun or funny -- if they are interesting and appropriate to the child. Realize that children are naturally curious and are always learning "math" as well as other languages whether you guide them or not, but don't expect much obvious results at first.
 Some activities are mostly for the younger, less taught and the less-skilled child from infancy to preschool age or even kindergarten.


Choose activities that are easy, safe enough and while using age-appropriate child discipline. Avoid and discard any activity that is disagreeable to you and/or the child -- causes anxiety, frustration, that the child does not wish to accept, etc.

NOTE: The age groupings below are approximate. Some children will learn earlier or later than others. Don't get too excited if your child is ahead of or behind on any of these groupings. The information here is NOT a psychological IQ test! It's just fun things you can do with your child to help them assimilate concepts and information.

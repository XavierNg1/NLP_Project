 These will pollute your body, which is a temple. Your body is badly affected by these, and the true devotee abstains from all bad foods to purify his senses. To take the first step on the path, one must only consume healthy food and drink in order to purify the body that Krishna resides in, and resides within Krishna.
 Live a simple life. This means finding enjoyment in the smaller things in life; a walk in the park with a loved one, thunderstorms on a summer night, a trip to a vegetarian restaurant. These are all gifts from Krishna that we should enjoy rather than living beyond what is essential. Much joy is a result of this path, for He will provide all you need. In order to take the third step on the path, one should stop buying things that do not benefit your spiritual growth, give freely, and offer all excess wealth to Krishna.
 This means abstinence from all sexual activity outside of married life. This path only ends in sadness and is only a distraction on the path to God. To overcome lust for the first time is the third step to find Krishna.
 This includes alcohol, tobacco, or caffeine. These not only have physically adverse effects, they also cloud the clear mind we all seek. Abstain from anything addictive. As the oracle at Delphi states, "Know thyself. Nothing to excess". Removing these harmful substances from your life is the fourth and final step on the path to Krishna.

 You can use a normal kind of paint, but you might have an easier time using a fine-tipped paint marker. A paint marker can be held like a pencil and will likely be a more familiar tool for adding a message to your box. Write things like:


The names of the bride and groom.

Mr. & Mrs., Lace is a beautiful, delicate addition that integrates nicely with most wedding décor. Wrap the top of your box in lace and use a hot glue gun to attach it to the insides of the box. Cut strips of lace, tie them into decorative bows, and attach them to the box with hot glue.


If you plan on covering the bottom of your box in lace, you can often tuck your lace beneath the inner padding/pillow of your box., High quality beads and faux pearls can be used to make neat designs on your box. For example, you might cutout the shape of a heart on a piece of card stock and then border it with fake pearls. Attach this to your box with a suitable glue, like hot glue.Designs like these can be added freehand to your box or with a guide, like a stencil. Beads and pearls can be glued to cutouts and attached, as well.
 The fabric on the inside of your box can be whatever pattern you desire. For example, if you and your fiancé are fans of a TV show like Doctor Who, you might use Doctor Who themed fabric for your box padding. Other ideas include themed patterns representing:


Movies
Books
TV shows
Hobbies

, Much like lace, ribbons are great for tying bows. Choose a suitable length of ribbon, tie your bow, and attach it to your box with a little bit of hot glue. Be creative with your bow placement. A few small bows on the sides, for example, might be the perfect addition to your box.


Thicker ribbon will create more prominent bows. Use these for centerpieces in the box design or at anchor points, like at the corners.
Smaller bows may be hard to see from a distance, but will add a delicate aspect to the box. These work well along the sides or as an accent to more central designs.

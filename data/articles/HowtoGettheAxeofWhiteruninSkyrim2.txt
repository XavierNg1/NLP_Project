 Once you get to the Western Tower, the dragon will start attacking you and everything moving around the area. Climb the tower using the staircase inside the structure.
 Once you’re at the top of the tower, use bow and arrows or range spell attacks like Fire Bolt, Lightning Bolt, or Ice Spikes to damage the monster.


Since you cannot fly, you have to bring down the dragon by using range attacks.
 Once the monster takes enough damage, it will land and attack you. Climb down the tower, and use whatever melee weapon you have to attack and damage it up close.
 If you aren’t able to kill the dragon quickly, it will take flight and resume its attack from the sky. Just repeat the previous steps to bring it down again, and attack it up front once more until you kill the dragon.

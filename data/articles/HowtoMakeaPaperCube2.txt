 The bigger your paper, the larger the final cube will be.
 In the center of your paper, draw a long rectangle and divide it up into four 2 inch (5.1 cm) squares.
 Draw another square to the right of the second square from the top.
 Draw another square to the left of the second square from the top.









Now it should look like a cross with six equal sized squares and the the longest part should be closest to you.
If you have a printer, you can print out the image below to use as your pattern. Note the “ears,” or tabs, on the sides and top of the cubes—these are useful if you wish to glue your box together.
 With scissors or a hobby knife, cut along the outside edges of the shape. If you printed the pattern and are gluing the box together, be careful not to cut off the tabs!








, Follow along the inside lines, and fold the paper inward.









If you’re gluing, make sure you fold the tabs inward as well.
 The square on the very bottom should be folded so it is parallel or directly across from the square that was in the middle.
 Tape all of the sides together, and you’re done!.


If you are gluing, apply a couple drops of hobby glue or paste to the tabs, and then press the outside of the box against the glued tabs.

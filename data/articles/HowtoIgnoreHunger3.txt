 Eating breakfast will prevent hunger throughout the morning, and give you a fuller feeling throughout the day. In addition, eating breakfasts regularly may reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.Try oatmeal with fruit, milk and nuts in the morning. This breakfast is an excellent mix of protein, whole grains and fiber. It will keep you feeling full past noon.
Another option is an omelette with spinach, cheese and avocado. The mix of protein, healthy fats and fiber will also increase the time you can last until your next meal.
 Try turkey, chicken, pork, egg whites, beans, tofu and non-fat Greek yogurt to feel more satisfied all day long. Don't limit your protein consumption to meals, but include protein during light snacks throughout the day.Peanut butter may also help you feel less hungry. According to a study conducted by Purdue University, peanut butter seems to lessen appetite for up to two hours longer than a low-fiber, high-carb snack such as potato chips.
Make sure your protein isn't laden with high fructose corn syrup or other sucrose-based additives.
 Cooking fats like olive oil, avocado, nut oils, coconut oil and even butter can make you feel more satisfied with your meal. You might start to feel hungry if fat levels drop too severely. Including some olive oil or other heart-healthy fats may help you feel less hungry.A recent study showed that volunteers who included an avocado with their lunches were 40% less likely to report feeling hungry later in the day than people who didn't.
Part of olive oil's appetite suppressing abilities appears to come from its aroma, so including aromatic olive oil as a regular part of your diet may serve to decrease appetite.

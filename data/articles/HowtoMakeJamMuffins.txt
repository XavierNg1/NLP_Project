,, In a large bowl, whisk the salt, flour, baking powder, and sugar until well combined. Use circular motions to get the ingredients to combine well together. Make a small well in the center with your hands.


It is recommended to use a large bowl since all your muffin batter will be in there.
 In a separate bowl, beat the egg, milk, and oil until it turns into a light-yellow type of mixture. Pour the wet mixture into the well.
 Using a whisk, mix lightly and gently until batter is moistened. Do not beat, that causes the muffins to not rise while baking. Just stir lightly until combined well. The batter will be lumpy. After mixing, slowly pour the jam and mix again.
 Use a spoon or ice-cream scoop to pour the muffins easily in the muffin tray cups. Scrape any excess batter with a rubber spatula.
 Place the muffin tray in the oven and bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown. Have cool once they have fully baked. Serve.

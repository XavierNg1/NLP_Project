 Many libraries require you to present proof of residency in order to get a library card. Before you head to the library, gather two pieces of mail with your given name and address on them, such as a bank statement or utility bill.For children or teenagers, a parent’s proof of residency is usually requested.
 Once you’ve proven residency, you need to prove you are who you say you are. Your library branch will require some form of ID. Although this is typically a state-issued license or ID, students may be able to use their school ID cards, as well., Libraries do not issue library cards online, so make sure you locate and visit your local library in person with the required documents. If you live outside of the area, you may also be required to pay a yearly fee.Although using online catalogs is possible, you have to have a library card before you can use library resources.
 While at the library, set up your online library profile. This typically uses your library card barcode and a password of your choosing. Creating an online library profile is required to check out items digitally.


The way to set up your online account varies from library to library. Some will have simple instructions, while others will require a librarian to complete the process for you.

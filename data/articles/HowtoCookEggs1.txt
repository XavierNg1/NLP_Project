 Set the skillet on the stove and heat it for several minutes over medium heat.


Note that you can use 2 tsp (10 ml) of butter or margarine instead of the cooking spray, if desired, but the cooking spray affects the flavor less and makes the dish somewhat healthier.;
, Crack the eggs into a separate bowl and add the milk, salt, and pepper. Beat well by hand with a wire whisk until all of the ingredients have been combine and the mixture appears mildly frothy.


The eggs are the only essential ingredient, so you can choose to opt out of the milk, salt, and pepper if desired. Milk creates a richer taste, however.






If you beat the eggs lightly, the final result will be fairly dense. If you beat the eggs significantly, though, you will beat more air into the mixture and your scrambled eggs will have a lighter texture as a result., Add the beaten eggs to the hot skillet and allow them to cook until they begin to set around the edges.


Cook the eggs on medium heat to avoid overcooking or burning them.






Note that the eggs should still look liquidy along the top surface when you prepare to turn them for the first time.
 Once the eggs begin to set around the edges, use a heat-resistant spatula to carefully pull the eggs toward you, flipping them over so that the bottom portion comes to the top while the liquid underside gets swapped to the bottom.


Pull the eggs toward you by scraping the spatula beneath them from the side opposite you and dragging the spatula toward you so that the eggs are flipped over.






Periodically flip the eggs as they cook, resting 20 seconds or so in between each flip. Do not move the eggs around too frequently. Otherwise, they may end up breaking into pieces that are too small and difficult to eat.






Keep turning the eggs in the pan until all traces of liquid have been removed.
 Scrambled eggs are difficult to store and reheat, so you should enjoy them as soon as they finish cooking.

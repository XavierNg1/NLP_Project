 In order for angelfish to become mature and be able to mate, they need to be properly cared for and given adequate space. If they are cared for and given the right amount of space, they may reach maturity as early as 5 to 7 months of age. At this time, they will be mature enough to breed and spawn.Adequate space would be about 7-10 gallons of water per angelfish. Sometimes, though, even with the best care and the right amount of space, certain strains of angelfish might take longer to mature.;
, Once the angelfish are mature, you will notice that small tube-like appendages have emerged on their bellies. These tubes will be just behind the “feeler” fins on their bellies. You might notice them more if other fish in the tank are breeding.These tubes are very small, so you will need to look closely to notice them. Catching the fish in a net or putting them in a smaller tank temporarily for observation purposes might help you get a better look, just make sure you handle the fish carefully.
 Once you’ve located the tube and can examine it adequately, look at the shape of the tube. On male angelfish, the tube will be pointy and narrow. It might look something like the tip of a sharpened pencil. With female angelfish, the tube will be more round and have a cylindrical shape.If you happen to have another breeding pair, you can put the angelfish you want to sex in with them. This might encourage them to drop their tubes for you to be able to tell their gender.

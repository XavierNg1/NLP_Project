 You will need: two glass beakers, filter paper and potassium nitrate for the salt bridge, aluminium foil and one molar aluminium nitrate solution for the negative electrode, wires and crocodile clips. The materials for the positive electrode vary. You will also need something to act as a circuit load, like a light bulb.

One molar = one mole per litre.;
,,,, Bend the filter paper so that it touches the bottom of both beakers.,, The strip should touch the bottom of the beaker. It should not touch the salt bridge. You may wish to bend the top of the strip over the edge of the beaker. This aluminium strip is the electrode.

You have formed an Al3+/Al half cell.
 You will need: a strip of copper and some one molar copper nitrate solution.,, It should touch the bottom, but not the salt bridge. This is the positive electrode.

This cell has a voltage of 1.821V.
 You will need: one molar iron (III) nitrate (Fe(NO3)3) solution, one molar iron (II) nitrate (Fe(NO3)2) solution, and a conductive graphite rod.,, It should not touch the salt bridge. This is the positive electrode.

This cell has a voltage of 2.432V.
 You will need: one molar potassium dichromate solution, one molar nitric acid, one molar chromium nitrate solution, and a conductive graphite rod., One measure should be the largest amount that you can add without the beaker overflowing after everything is added., It should not touch the salt bridge. This is the positive electrode.

This cell has a voltage of 2.992V.
 You will need: one molar potassium permanganate solution, one molar nitric acid, one molar manganese nitrate solution, and a conductive graphite rod., One measure should be the largest amount that you can add without the beaker overflowing after everything is added., It should not touch the salt bridge. This is the positive electrode.

This cell has a voltage of 3.172V.
, The bulb should light up.

 Almost all gardeners want loamy soil, which is gritty but moist, nutrient-rich and easy to till. Sandy, silty or clay soil is generally undesirable. Inspect your soil to determine its composition and test it using a soil test kit.


Soil with less than 3 percent of organic matter should be amended with organic matter like composted manure, straw, grass clippings or wood chips.
Amend with peat if you have sandy soil. Avoid using mountain peat, because harvesting it is severely disruptive to the environment.
Biosolids consist of treated sewage mixed with other organic matter such as leaves or clippings. Use only Grade 1 biosolids, which are relatively free of pathogens, and only if you aren't growing root vegetables such as carrots or potatoes. Most gardeners balk at using biosolids to grow any food crops.
Add bark or perlite to clay soils. Never try to amend clay with sand because the combination will result in a soil that resembles concrete.;
, You may have to use a chemical fertilizer to make an adjustment. Select a low pH amendment if your soil tends to be high pH.


Choose an amendment that decomposes rapidly if you want to improve the quality of your soil quickly. Use one that decomposes slowly if you want long-lasting improvement. Most gardeners mix amendments to get both quick and long-lasting improvements.
 Measure the square footage of the area and multiply this number by the desired depth. You may have to do some fairly complex calculations if your garden isn't rectangular. The more accurate your measurements, the less likely you are to buy too much or too little amendment for your needs.
 You may be able to have large amounts of amendments delivered to your garden by the seller.

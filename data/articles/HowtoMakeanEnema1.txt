Olive oil is a gentle way to soften stools. It can also lubricate the rectum, which allows stools to pass through more readily.
For a slight variation, consider combining 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of olive oil with 1 qt (1 L) of whole milk and 1/2 qt (1/2 L) of distilled water.

As the colon metabolizes the milk, the bacteria living there creates gas, which pushes the enema further into the colon and makes it more effective.

, Place the saucepan on the stove and heat it gently over medium heat. It should reach a temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius).


For an oil enema that includes milk, watch the contents of the saucepan closely to prevent the milk from curdling. If the milk does curdle, do not use the solution; discard it and start over.
 Administer the enema and try to wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before evacuating your bowels.


In some individuals, the milk may cause a violent reaction rather quickly. You should at least try to administer the entire enema before evacuating the bowels, but beyond that, there is no strict time limit on a milk-based oil enema.

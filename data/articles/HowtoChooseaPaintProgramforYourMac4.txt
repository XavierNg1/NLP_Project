 Artrage bridges the gap between simple painting applications and more full-featured offerings such as Photoshop and Painter. It offers scalable pressure for graphics tablet users, a unique, clean, and well-thought-out interface, and a variety of useful tools. The "starter edition" has many of these features visible, but inaccessible without upgrading. The basic full version is $30USD, and the Pro version with even more features is $60USD. There are also versions available for iPad, iPhone, and older Macs

, Admittedly more interesting than useful, the amazing graphic options and crazy sound effects within this application will keep you entertained for hours on end. One caveat with this is that Beautiful Dorena will not run on Mac OS versions 10.7 or later.

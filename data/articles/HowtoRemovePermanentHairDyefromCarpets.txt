 Mix one tablespoon of each with 2 cups of warm water.;
, Sponge the stain with your detergent/vinegar solution, blotting frequently with a dry cloth until the stain fades. (It may not fade completely right away, just go to the next steps.)

, Again blot until all liquid is absorbed.
 Yet again blot with a dry cloth to further remove the stain.
 Normally the stain would be gone, but if it's still there, try the next steps.
 This time mix 1 teaspoon of detergent, 1 tablespoon of ammonia and 2 cups of warm water.
 Leave it for around 30 minutes, blotting every 5 minutes with a clean cloth and more solution.
 If all this hasn't worked, there is another method which has less success but you can try.
 Use an eyedropper to put it on the stain, leaving it there for 24 hours. Repeat if necessary. Note to try this on a hidden piece of carpet first for it may remove the color of your carpet.

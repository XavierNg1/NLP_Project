 This will stack a second, identical layer over your original image.;
, This will blur the entire image; you’ll work backwards from here.


Play around with different blur radii to create the background effect you want. The larger the radius, the blurrier the image, so if you’re going for a subtle effect, aim low. For example, if you want the background to be very soft and only somewhat identifiable, try a radius of 10. If you want your background just barely blurred, use a radius of .5 or 1.
Make sure you’re working on the top layer when you add the blur.
 Since the original layer is still intact beneath the blurred one, using the eraser tool on your top layer will expose the clear image underneath.


Select the Eraser tool from the toolbar to the left.
Adjust the eraser size as you go. For larger swaths, use a large eraser; for details and edges, use a smaller, more precise eraser.
Adjust the eraser opacity as you go. For large, interior areas, use a high opacity to erase as thoroughly as possible; for edges, lower the opacity to create a softer, subtle effect. Running a low-opacity eraser over the same place multiple times will have a cumulative effect, so err on the side of low opacity where necessary.
 This will combine your various layers into one.

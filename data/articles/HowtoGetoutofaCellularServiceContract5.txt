 If you’ve just signed up for a plan, and are struck with instant buyer’s remorse, don’t wait to take action. You probably have a grace period (usually 14 days) within which you can cancel the agreement. Check your contract immediately, or call the carrier to find out the exact timeframe for cancellation., Determine if there’s a particular method that you have to use to take advantage of the grace period cancellation provision. See if merely speaking with a customer service representative is enough, or if you have to submit a request in writing.
 Assuming you haven’t bought your phone outright from the carrier, obviously they’re going to want it back. Again, find out how the carrier wants that done, and act accordingly. Also, don’t be surprised if you’re assessed a restocking fee of about $35.

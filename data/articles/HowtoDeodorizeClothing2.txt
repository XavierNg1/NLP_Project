 Add ½ cup of Borax for every half gallon of water you use and soak your clothes for at least 30 minutes in a large sink or tub.Borax is very effective in removing odors due to certain aspects of its chemical makeup that inhibit the metabolic processes of many odor-causing bacteria.


Be sure to wash your clothes after using Borax. Another useful property of Borax is that it actually increases the effectiveness of other laundry detergents. After you’re done soaking your clothes, run them through the washing machine as you normally would and allow the unique chemical properties of Borax to work their magic!

, Specialty detergents like Nathan’s Sport Wash or Sport Suds are specifically designed for removing body odor and bacteria from workout clothing, but their deodorizing properties usually do the trick for other unwanted smells. Simply add the recommended amount to your washing machine and wash as normal.Some sport washes, like Sport Suds, are reportedly powerful enough to dissolve gunk on the inside of your washing machine. It’s recommended to give your washing machine a deep clean before laundering your clothes with detergents like these.
 Homemade specialty detergents can be just as effective as commercial products, if not more. Most recipes for homemade detergents call for a mix of natural and chemical ingredients. One popular recipe calls for 3 tablespoons Borax, 3 tablespoons baking soda, and 2 tablespoons Dawn dishwashing liquid. Add these to 2 cups hot water in a gallon jug and shake until well mixed. Then, add cold water until the jug is full.Making your own specialty detergent is also remarkably cost effective. You could reduce your cost per load of laundry from $.50 to $.03!

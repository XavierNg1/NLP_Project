 Go to the launcher and open "File Manager" from the menu.;
, There will be a folder named "Media" in the phone's memory. Open it.
 Create a new folder with the name of "Audio" inside the "Media” folder. If the folder is already exists, then you don't have to create a new one.
 After this, make new subfolders inside the "Audio" folder. These subfolders can be named differently depending on your own convenience.


For instance, create a subfolder named "Ringtones," and add all the sound files that you want to use as a tone for incoming calls.
 Then, simply copy and paste the MP3 file into the relevant folder (in this case, the ‘Ringtones’ folder).



Go to Settings.
Tap on Sounds and Display. There you will be able to see the pasted MP3 file in your ringtones list to choose from.

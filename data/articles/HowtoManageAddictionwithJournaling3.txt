 First, identify the event and any relevant details about it.


List when the event or social situation is, where it will be, who will be there, what it is for, and why you want/need to attend it.
A worrisome event could take many forms. For example, you might have a family gathering that you are worried about, an upcoming business trip, or just an outing with friends.
 Record your thoughts and feelings surrounding the event in your journal.


For example, you might identify that you are feeling worried, anxious, and excited. Try to examine these feelings and explain where they might be coming from.
 What will you do to avoid allowing these feelings to affect you? How will you avoid a situation where you might be tempted to use? For example, you might decide that you will:


only stay for a limited amount of time, such as one hour.
call your counselor or sponsor before and after the event.
excuse yourself to go and do some deep breathing exercises if you get overwhelmed.
 For example, did you stick to your plan? How did you feel during and after the event? What might you do differently next time?


Describe how you think things went and how it made you feel.

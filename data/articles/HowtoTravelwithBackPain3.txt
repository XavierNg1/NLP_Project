This will keep your body strong throughout the trip, lessening the likelihood of back pain., While many people love gazing out the window during a plane ride, it's better for your back to sit near the aisle. This way, it's easy to get up when necessary, allowing you to easily walk around and stretch., If you're on any medication for your back, always pack your medication prior to traveling. Make sure you keep your medication in your carry on bag on a plane in case your checked bag gets lost.It's a good idea to have some over-the-counter medications on hand as well in case your prescription medications aren't cutting it.

Pack only what you need and leave heavier items, like clunky shoes or thick books, behind., Backpacks are convenient and have the added benefit of putting less strain on your back. Keep a backpack across both your shoulders rather than slung over one shoulder or the other.Your backpack's weight should be no more than 10 to 20% of your total body weight.

 Let your coworker know there are varying distances in which people feel either comfortable or uncomfortable. Providing this information may be a wakeup call if they are unaware.



Public space – Research shows this distance is acceptable for all, and roughly about 12 feet.

Social space – This, anywhere from 4-12 feet, is where people should stand when talking to one another.

Personal space – When people get in your actual personal space, which is from 1.5ft to 4ft, they are in an area for those displaying aggressiveness or intimacy.

Intimate space – This is the closest someone can be, less than 1.5ft, and it’s a spot reserved for only those with whom we are intimate. Getting this close is definitely an issue.
 Explain that you are uncomfortable. You shouldn't make a scene at your workplace, but do be clear and firm. It may take a while for them to break the habit. Continue to remind them if they continue to do it. To say "No" is absolutely acceptable and appropriate.
 They may simply be unaware of what they’re doing. Or they may believe you two are more closely associated, permitting the closer interaction. Try one of the following approaches:


You are too close to me right now. It’s awkward for you to be this close to me.
Do you realize being this close is a social faux pas?
I’d like to have a bit more room between us when talking. I just don’t like people in my bubble.

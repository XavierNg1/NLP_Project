 The Fahrenheit and Celsius scales begin at a different number—where 0° Celsius is freezing, that equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit is 32°. In addition to starting at a different temperature, the two scales rise at different rates as well. For instance, the range from freezing to boiling in degrees Celsius is 0-100°, and the same range in degrees Fahrenheit is 32-212°., Since freezing for Fahrenheit is 32 and freezing for Celsius is 0, you begin the conversion by subtracting 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature.For example, if your initial Fahrenheit temperature is 74°F, just subtract 32 from 74. 74-32 = 42., The range for freezing to boiling in Celsius is 0-100 whereas it's 32-212 in Fahrenheit. This is the same as saying that for every 180° Fahrenheit range, there is only a 100° Celsius range. You can express that as 180/100, which when simplified equals 1.8, so to finish the conversion you must divide by 1.8.


For the example from step one, divide your result, 42, by 1.8. 42/1.8 = 23°C. Therefore, 74°F can be converted to 23°C.
Note that 1.8 is the equivalent of 9/5. If you don't have a calculator or prefer working with fractions, you can divide your result from the first step by 9/5 instead of 1.8.
 Here are a few conversions so you can see whether your result makes sense. If you get a result that doesn't fit this scale, check your math again. You may have forgot to subtract before dividing.

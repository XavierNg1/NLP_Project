 Although some parents prefer to schedule feedings, this method is generally not recommended for breastfed babies. Unlike formula-fed babies who are given a specific number of ounces of formula per feeding, there is no way to gauge exactly how many ounces of breast milk your baby is eating. For this reason, it is recommended that breastfed babies be fed on demand. Your baby will determine when she is hungry and will provide the cues to alert you.
 She will decide when she has had enough to satisfy her needs. Some babies will need encouragement to empty the first breast, others will be completely satisfied after just one breast and some babies may need to empty both breasts to feel full.



Alternating breasts at each session will prevent one breast from becoming engorged with milk while allowing each breast time to replenish the milk supply.
The composition of the milk changes throughout the nursing session. Fore milk is the milk that is produced during the beginning of a nursing session. It is a thinner consistency and does not contain much fat. It is the first portion of the milk to trickle out of the milk ducts, leaving behind the fat cells. This milk quenches the baby’s thirst.
Nursing stimulates increased milk production, which causes ducts to squeeze out additional milk, along with the fat cells that were left behind. This milk is produced towards the end of the nursing session and is referred to as the hind milk. By alternating breasts at the start of every nursing session, you can ensure that your baby is receiving the benefits of both types of milk.
 You should never pull your nipple out of baby’s mouth without first breaking suction; otherwise you may begin to experience tender nipples. In addition, the abrupt cessation of milk may cause your baby to become irritable.

 Measure around the cuff of your sleeve first. Add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters), then cut the lace accordingly.You will need to do this entire method twice, once for each sleeve.


If this is for a dress shirt, make sure that you include the entire length of the cuff, including the overlap.
Lace that is scalloped on one side and straight on the other works great for this.;
, Align the top edge of the lace up with the top edge of the hem. Overlap both ends of the lace by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Position them at the bottom of the sleeve, where the seam is.


If the lace is too long, push it further up the sleeve.
 Once you are happy with the look, secure the lace with sewing pins. If your shirt has a buttoned cuff, like in a dress shirt, do the following:


Unbutton and open the cuff.
Align the ends of the lace with the side edges of the cuff.
Fold the ends of the lace down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).
Pin the lace in place.
 You can do this by hand or on the sewing machine. Try to place your stitches along the hem's original stitching. This will make your stitches less visible and obvious.Match the thread color to the fabric or the hem's stitching.
 Go back to where you overlapped the ends of the cuff by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Sew down the overlap using a thread color that matches your lace. This will keep the cuff together.


Consider spreading the edges apart slightly before you sew them for a flared look.
 Go over your lace cuff, and trim off any loose threads. If you pushed your lace further up the sleeve, consider trimming off the excess lace. Leave a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) hem.

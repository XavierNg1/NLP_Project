 You want to choose something that you feel comfortable with, so if you have experience with something like WordPress, maybe you should stick with that. Weebly, Penzu, and Squarespace are all other easy to use free blog options. Do some research and check out which one you like best.;
, You should get a palette that really helps your blog stand out and attracts visitors to your site. Try to choose one that really fits your brand. Companies that use their blog to their advantage have chosen a theme that stays true to their brand and is very targeted. For example if your company specializes in health food for families, make sure the tone of the theme fits that message. You won’t want a jet black Halloween themed website.
 Your layout should be easy on the eyes but more importantly easy to understand. If your reader gets lost trying to find the content they want to explore, it’s going to be a huge turn off. If you decide to use advertisements, make sure they are placed on the blog in an artful way. If you have ads and content sharing the same space that can push people away from your site. You can choose a scroll down look where all your content appears on the same page or you can choose to make tabs that fit different categories. Its up to you, and whatever blog website you choose to use will guide you through it easily.

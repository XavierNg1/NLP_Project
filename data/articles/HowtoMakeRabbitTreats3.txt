 If you buy any fruits and vegetables for your rabbit, make sure to rinse them under clean, running water before using them in recipes. You do not want your rabbit to ingest any pesticides or other potential harmful substances., Adding table sugar to rabbit treats can cause obesity and dental problems. If you want to sweeten your rabbit's treats, use fruit or natural sugars like those found in honey, but use sparingly and only every once in a while. Recipes that require you to dip treats in sweetened yogurt should be avoided. While your rabbit may enjoy the sweet foods, he could easily get sick from added sugar., Treats are not a replacement for healthy rabbit pellets. Never overfeed your rabbit. Give him only one or two treats at a time and store the rest for later use.

 This goes without saying in the first place; you can easily avoid being locked out if you take the key with you when you leave. Always double check that you have it with you when you leave for the day, and when returning to the room at night. If you tend to be forgetful, put the key somewhere obvious before going to bed, like on top of your clothes or inside your shoes.

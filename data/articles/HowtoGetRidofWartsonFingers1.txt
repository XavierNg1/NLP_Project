 Salicylic acid is a nonprescription wart removal option you can find at your local drugstore or pharmacy. It helps to dissolve the protein of the wart and the dead skin around it. Look for wart removal pads, plasters, gels or drops that contain 17 percent salicylic acid solution or patches that contain 15 percent salicylic acid.You will need to apply these products once a day for several weeks. For optimal results, soak your finger or fingers with the warts in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes. This will soften the skin of the wart. Then, file away at any dead skin on or around the wart with an emery board or a pumice stone. Once you have filed away the dead skin, apply the salicylic acid pad, gel, plaster or patch to the wart.
You can then file away at the dead skin that appears on and around the wart between treatments with an emery board or a pumice stone. Do not share the board or pumice stone with anyone else and throw it away once the wart is removed.
You may need to apply the salicylic acid for 12 weeks or more until the wart flattens and fades away. If the wart becomes irritated, sore, or red, you should stop using the salicylic acid product and talk to your doctor.;
, You can also use freezing products on the warts to try to remove them. Aerosol wart treatments can be purchased over-the-counter at your local drugstore or pharmacy. These sprays will freeze the warts at a temperature of minus 90°F (minus 57°C).Keep in mind over-the-counter freezing products will not work as well as liquid nitrogen agents applied by your doctor to the warts. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises caution when using wart removers, as they are flammable and should not be used around fire or any heat sources.

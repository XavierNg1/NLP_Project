 In Georgia, the CDL requirements are broken into different classes, based on the size and purpose of the vehicle you will be driving. You will want to be familiar with the three different classes and their applications, so you will know what to apply for.Class A is for a combination vehicle (cab and trailer) with a combined weight rating of 26,000 pounds, and that is capable of towing a unit over 10,000 pounds.
Class B is for a single vehicle (non-towing) with a gross vehicle weight rating of over 26,000 pounds.
Class C is for a vehicle designed to carry 16 or more passengers, or for a vehicle that transports hazardous materials.
If none of these apply, then a CDL is not required.
 There are certain circumstances in which a CDL is not required in Georgia. These exemptions include the following:Recreational vehicles used for personal use.
Military vehicles
Emergency vehicles
Farm vehicles, which are not used for hire or not driven more than 150 miles from the farm.
 In addition to obtaining the correct CDL, a driver may obtain and qualify for certain endorsements. There are five separate endorsements that a driver may obtain:The “T” endorsement is for drivers who will be driving double or triple trailers
The “P” endorsement is for drivers who will be transporting 16 or more passengers.
The “N” Tanker endorsement is for certain vehicles that will be transporting liquids or gases.
The “H” endorsement is for transporting hazardous materials.
The “X” endorsement is a combination of the hazardous materials (H) and tanker (N).
Each of the endorsements, along with a description of what you will need to demonstrate to qualify, is described in more detail in the Georgia Commercial Drivers Manual.Adding an endorsement to your CDL carries an additional fee, due at the time of application, of $5.

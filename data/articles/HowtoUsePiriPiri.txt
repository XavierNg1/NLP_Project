 Substitute piri piri for mustard in a standard dressing recipe. It will bring a tasty, warmer flavour to salads.
 Give veggies such as mashed potatoes, kumara (sweet potatoes) and pumpkin a lift with the addition of piri piri. A teaspoon dolloped over each serve of green French beans is delicious too.

 The skin should be as light as possible at the time of treatment. For this reason, many people choose to undergo laser treatment during winter.


Apply sunscreen with at least an SPF 15 if you do need to spend time outdoors, and the area you wish to have hair removed by laser will be exposed to UVA/UVB rays.;
, Shaving is fine, but these other hair removal techniques can reduce the effectiveness of the laser treatment. Also, the hair should not be bleached.
 This is usually a day or two before the appointment. The hair follicles should be visible, but it can be more painful if longer hair is present during the laser hair removal.
, If you apply deodorant, it will be removed prior to treatment.

 While checking the data usage in your Settings will show you how much you've used, it won't show you what your limit is, and sometimes the date and measurement is off compared to your carrier. You can quickly check how close you are to your monthly limit by entering the code for your carrier into the Phone app:



Verizon - Dial #DATA and press the "Call" button. You will receive a text message showing all your usage details for that billing cycle.

AT&T - Dial *DATA# and press the "Call" button. You will receive a text message showing how much data you've used versus your monthly limit.

T-Mobile - Dial #WEB# and press the "Call" button. You will receive a text message showing how much data you've used versus your monthly limit.

Sprint - Dial *4 and press the "Call" button. Follow the voice prompts to check your usage for the billing period.

Idea (IN) - Dial *121# and press the "Call" button. You will receive a reply with your usage.
 Most cellular carriers have an app you can download to your iPhone; once you do so, you'll be able to monitor your data usage and plan information from within the app.



Verizon - Download the My Verizon app.

Sprint - Download the My Sprint Mobile app.

T-Mobile - Download the T-Mobile app.

AT&T - Download the myAT&T app.

TELUS (CA) - Download the TELUS My Account app.

Vodafone - Download the My Vodafone app.

Rogers (CA) - Download the MyRogers app.
 If all else fails, calling your carrier's support line or going to your local carrier's store directly will allow them to tell you how much data you've used and how much remains in your current cycle, as well as upgrade your plan if you feel it would be beneficial.

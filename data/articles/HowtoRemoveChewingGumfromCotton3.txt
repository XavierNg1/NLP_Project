 Soaking the the garment in a slightly acidic solution will start to break down the gum and help release its grip on the fabric. You need only soak the gummed up portion of the garment, but you can also dunk the entire item if that is easier to do.The first option for soaking is lemon juice, either fresh-squeezed or bottled pure lemon juice.
You can also use white vinegar, which may work even better if warmed.
Let the garment soak until the gum begins to loosen from the garment, then scrape it away with the back of a butter knife. Rinse away the remaining juice or vinegar, then spot-clean (if necessary) and launder the garment as usual.
 No one would ever confuse hairspray and mayonnaise, but either one can be used as a gum-removal coating in a pinch. They may also be a bit messier than other methods, though.Coat the gum with aerosol hairspray, then let it dry. The gum will harden and be easier to scrape away.
Work a healthy dab of mayo into the gum. The oils and acids in the mayonnaise will help break down and loosen the gum, and it should peel away much more easily.
Rinse, spot-clean, and launder the garment as needed and recommended.
 Chewed gum may love to stick to cotton clothing, but if you give it an even more appealing option — like something that is also sticky — it may change its mind and move on without a fight.Mounting putty — the kind used to hang dorm-room posters — can be pressed over the gum. Once you get a good bond, peel the entire glob away.
Also, you can add one more item to the long list of uses for duct tape. Lay a strip over the gum, smooth it over, then pull it off purposefully (somewhere between gently peeling and ripping it away).
Once again, spot-clean and launder the garment as recommended.

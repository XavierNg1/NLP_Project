 Surfer girls often have wet, wavy hair. To achieve this, mist your hair with a matte hair spray to get it a little damp. From there, douse your hair in some sea salt spray. Then, you can use your fingers to bunch your hair to create messy waves.If your hair is already damp, just use the sea salt spray.
You should avoid using sea salt spray, however, if you were actually at the beach, as too much salt could damage your hair.
 A long braid can give your hair a mermaid vibe. If you have longer braid, try braiding it into a single long braid that hangs over your shoulder. This is a great look to pair with hats., You want the sun-kissed look of someone who spends a lot of time on the beach. Bronzer can help you achieve this. You can dust your face with a layer of bronzer to give yourself a believable tan.If you actually do spend a lot of time on the beach, use sunscreen under your bronzer and choose a bronzer with SPF protection.
 Surfer girls spend a lot of time in water. Therefore, elaborate makeup isn't exactly realistic. Neutral tones that match your natural skin work best.If you use foundation, use only a light amount that matches your skin.
Stick to neutral tones of eye shadow and lipstick, if you use them at all.
Minimize your use of things like eye liner or mascara. If they're used, use them very lightly.

 The standard font size is 12 point. It's often difficult to read font much smaller than this, so try not to make your font too smaller so your reader cannot read your document., For a formal or business document, use a common, serious font such as Arial or Times New Roman. When writing to a friend or family member, you can use a less serious font, but make sure the end result is still legible.
 Colored text should only be used to highlight words. Don't use neon colors, or multiple colors within the same word.
 If order is important, use a numbered list; if it is not, bullets may be the better option. In both cases, there should be a clear logical order to the list, so it does not seem arbitrary to your reader.
 This will make sure your reader understands it to be a complete thought. If itâ€™s not a complete sentence, make sure it connects to the previous section or heading clearly.
 Word documents will usually do this for you automatically. Each line or bullet should always start with a capital letter, even if it is a continuation of a previous section.
 Begin each bullet or number with an active verb or consistently use an adjective-noun sequence. If your bullets are numbers are not consistent, it will be confusing for your readers.
 Headings can help distinguish between topics or sections of your Word Document. This can help readers when skimming your document. Additionally, headings can be a great way to introduce bulleted or numbered lists.

 Look for the game app on your device. Its name is PvZ 2 with the app icon of a zombieâ€™s face. Tap on it.
 On the main screen, tap on the button with the wrench picture. The Settings screen will appear.
 Right below the Music bar is the Sound FX bar. This bar controls the volume of the sound effects in the game. When the bar is dragged to the right, the volume of the sound effects increases. Drag it to the left to turn it down. You will hear a sample of the sound at the set volume so you would know how much to adjust. To fully turn off the sound effects, drag the Sound FX bar all the way to the left.
 Tap on the X button on the Settings screen to save your settings and go back to the game.

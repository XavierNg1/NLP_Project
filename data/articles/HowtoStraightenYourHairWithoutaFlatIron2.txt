 This method is best used to turn moderately curly hair into gentle waves. The result won't be as straight as a flat iron could make, but your hair will be healthier and more resistant to humidity. This process is also very easy, and it requires no special hair products.
 Wash your hair in the evening. Towel dry gently, leaving it damp but not dripping.
 Comb or brush out any knots and tangles.
 Tie your hair into a loose ponytail using a fabric hair tie, not an elastic hairband. Add a second hair tie about 2 inches (5 cm) below the first, and repeat at regular intervals.


You can use hair clips or bobby pins instead.
 Remove them in the morning, or once your hair is dry.
 If the hairbands have left marks, brush them out with a round brush.

 These pumps use approximately 30 to 45 percent less energy than a regular pump and you can actually use them less frequently. The speed can be regulated, which means you can turn the pump down on most days and only run it at higher speeds when you need a thorough cleaning.


Additionally, high efficiency pumps are able to circulate pool water better than traditional pumps.
This will save you even more money, since well circulated water causes less daily stress on the filter.
 Longer increments are unnecessary and waste a lot of energy. If your pool water doesn't seem clean enough after the reduction, increase the time in half-hour increments until you achieve the results you want.


In a recent study, pool owners in Florida decreased their pumping to less than 3 hours each day. After doing so, the majority of them reported that they were still satisfied with the quality of their pool’s water.By doing this, the pool owners saved an average of 60 percent on their utility bills.
 A significant amount of energy can be saved if you regulate the pump’s daily cycling with a timer. Set your pump to run several short cycles throughout the day rather than running for long stretches of time. Your pool will actually be cleaner by doing this, especially if you deal with a lot of debris.


The shorter, more frequent cycles allow debris to be filtered out of the pool faster because it prevents it from building up.
It also puts less stress on the filter itself.

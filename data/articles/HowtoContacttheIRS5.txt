 The Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) is an independent organization within the IRS created to help taxpayers deal with their problems. If you cannot work out your problem with the IRS, then the TAS will help you for free.
 This form officially requests TAS assistance and allows you to specify your problem. You should receive a response within a week of TAS receiving the form.NOTE: The TAS may contact a third party, such as a taxpayer advocate organization, to respond to your request.
 A simple automated system will quickly direct you to an agent.
 Each state has at least one office. The contact page will give their phone number and address.

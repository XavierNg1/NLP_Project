 The following requirements are essential:


The book must be thick to make it harder to spot anything stuffed into it.
It should be inconspicuous. Choose a book that belongs on the shelf amid other books; don't choose one that looks obviously out of place.
Spacious and of adequate size to conceal your goodies. You could hollow out a book but that's more work and is often noticeable. If you're just looking to hide flat things, a normal book works just fine.;
, Try to put your stash about 3 quarters of the way into the book. People will see it in the middle and it'll fall out if it's in the end. And the beginning is just too obvious.
 If you have disturbed any dust or fluff bunnies in doing this, you'll just have to clean the whole shelf or else it will look obvious.
 Work out a way for reminding yourself which book or books you have chosen to hide things in. If you own a lot of books, it is not unknown to forget where you hid that "money for a rainy day", only to have a pleasant surprise many years later!

 This braid updo is perfect for short hair, which is often difficult to braid. Before you begin braiding you'll want to comb your hair out and part on the usual side.;
, If your part is on the right side, take a small portion of hair on the right side of your part and begin doing a french braid (do the opposite if your part is on the left side).

To french braid, begin by braiding your hair as usual, separating it into three equal parts, but as you go along, add strands to your previous three strands. Once you have started your traditional braid, pull a strand of hair from the right of the outside of the braid and add it to the right strand in the braid, and continue to do this with the left and right strands of hair around the braid to create a french braid.
 You'll continue to french braid the hair on the side of your part until you get to the bottom of your hair. You should have a french braid that is about half of your hair. Tie this with an elastic., You'll create the same type of side french braid again, but this time on the opposite side of your part. After you have braided down to the end of your hair, secure with an elastic. You should have two, relatively equal side french braids, creating two pigtails., Take the end of one french braid and fold it underneath your braid on the back of your head, so that you can't see the elastic. Use a bobby pin or two to secure it to your head. Then, repeat on the other side.This look would be difficult to do with long hair, as there will be too much leftover braid to pin under the french braids along your head.
 After you have pinned your hair up, you'll want to bobby pin any parts of your braid that are sticking up or are loose on your head. This helps create a clean look. If you are going for a messier look you can loosen the braids or leave any stray pieces unattended.

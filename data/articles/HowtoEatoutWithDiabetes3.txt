 Mixed alcoholic drinks, smoothies, and shakes are often packed with sugar. Avoid the sugar from mixed drinks or smoothies by sipping on water, iced tea, sugar-free soda, or a low-carb beer or wine.


If you must have a mixed drink, ask for sugar-free mixers or limit yourself to a single drink, then be sure to skip dessert.
 If you have watched your diet carefully through the entire meal and have avoided sugary drinks, order a dessert to share with your friends or family.


You will likely be just as satisfied with only a few bites of dessert as with the whole thing, and you will have the added comfort of knowing that you are keeping your blood sugar under control at the same time.
If you do order dessert, consider an option like fresh fruit salad (no glazes or gelatins if possible), sugar-free ice cream, fruit sorbet, sugar-free pudding, or another low-carb choice.
 Marinara sauce, glazes, salad dressings, bread baskets, pasta dishes, and reductions are often loaded with sugar even when they seem to be fresh or healthful options.


Always ask for dressings and sauces on the side.

 Tritoma are generally very resistant to pests and insects in general. However, it is possible that spider mites or aphids may be attracted to them. Get rid of these insects by spraying your tritoma with a light coating of insecticidal soap. Some larger aphids you can also pick off by hand., In many cases the foliage of tritoma will provide sufficient warmth for the plant in the winter. But, it is good idea to add an extra layer of protection by layering straw mulch over the planting area. The mulch will limit the damage from frostbite while improving drainage, too., In the early spring, use garden shears to snip off any dead flower spikes. This practice, called “deadheading,” will allow your tritoma to spend its energy on new blooms, which will continue to appear well into the fall. For the foliage, remove any dead leaves that you see, but do so sparingly in the winter as this foliage provides extra warmth for the plant., Before the summer flowering begins, dig up the bulbs, break them apart, and replant them in new areas. Give these divided plants some extra water until they appear established, as evidenced by sprouts coming up. Although this is a good remedy for overcrowding, make sure to not divide the same bulbs up more than once per five year or you’ll compromise their health., To give your tritoma an extra boost of energy and nutrients, mix some general purpose fertilizer into the soil in the spring. You can do this with both established and new plants. To protect the seedlings, always wait until they are fully established above the soil before using any fertilizer.To maintain the quality of the soil you can add a bit of fertilizer to the area of planting once every month thereafter.

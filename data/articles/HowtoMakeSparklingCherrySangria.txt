 You may want to skimp or cut corners but don't do it with the bubbly. The champagne is the basis of the drink so you want to serve your sangria with something delicious. Also, don’t go for an overly sweet champagne since you will adding fruit.


One bottle of champagne makes one pitcher of sangria.
Always be cautious popping the champagne cork--adults only.;
, For this drink you will need cherries, lemons, oranges and mint. Two lemons and two oranges will do the trick, however you’ll want to load up on the cherries (1 1/2 cups) and mint (1/2 cup).
 You’ll not only be pouring but also spooning some of the fruit into glasses.
 You should make the drink ahead of time so the fruit and champagne has an hour or two to ferment. Instead of leaving it in the refrigerator open, cover with plastic wrap to protect against other food odors that could be lurking., This means even the lemons and oranges as you will be adding them to the drink with peel in tact.
 Try to make the slices uniform as they will add color but also flavor to the drink.
 Consider de-pitting cherries before adding to drink (or you can still add the cherries with pits in tact).


Make a small slice in the side of the cherry and pop out the pit. Discard pit.
Rough chop mint to release oils and flavor (or you can add mint whole).
 Place the 1 1/2 cup of cherries in first, followed by the two sliced lemons, two sliced oranges and 1/2 cup of mint.
 Pour slowly so the champagne doesn’t overflow.

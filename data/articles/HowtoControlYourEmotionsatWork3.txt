 Each workplace may have a different way of operating. Some environments may be more supportive than others of their employees. Instead of getting angry or depressed, evaluate if this workplace is a good fit for you.If you feel like things aren't getting any better at your job, consider looking for work elsewhere. Do your job search only after work, and outside of work time.
If you feel like you need to keep this job, but are frustrated at the same time, identify people or things in your workplace that can make your daily grind less nerve-racking. For example, allocate time each day to spend time with co-workers that make you feel better. Or, consider using your lunch break to walk around the office.
 While you may not want to be seen as emotionally volatile, avoid making a complete reversal by acting like an emotionless robot. Suppressing your emotions and bottling them up will likely lead to negative feelings about your life and work in the long run.Focus on tackling your emotions in the moment, rather than suppressing them.
Make an effort to show that you are working towards happiness and betterment, rather than just "getting by" each day.
See your negative emotions as transitory. If you fixate on them, or suppress them, then they stick with you. If you try to better yourself in a positive way, then they seem less persistent.
 If you have your own desk or cubicle, use this space to make yourself feel more at home. A clean and organized space can also help to reduce stress and anxiety. Use the workspace available to make them more friendly and relaxing.Decorate your desk or office with things that you enjoy. Put mementos that help to remind you of happy memories from home or work. Have photos of friends and family.
Create spaces that are organized and clear of clutter. Clutter can make you feel more stressed.
Put up a picture or two of a place that makes you feel happy. Focus your attention on this picture when you need to calm down and feel less stressed.

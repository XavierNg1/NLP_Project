 In large part, minimalism is actually a practice in mindfulness. The act of ridding yourself of possessions is a turn away from the materialism, consumerism, and distractions of our world today. Consider the following benefits of minimalist living:Less focus on material items for personal fulfillment
Reduced stress about how much money you earn
Less clutter, and more free space;
, A harried social life goes against the fundamental goals of minimalism - to declutter, destress, and refocus. Take the initiative and eliminate toxic relationships from your life, focusing instead on the people who contribute to a happy state of being for you. Do not feel obligated to keep up with relationships that do not benefit your well-being, such as:friendships with people who don't have your best interests at heart
on-again, off-again relationships that cause you sadness

, Pick a few social media apps to keep and deactivate the rest. This minimalist move will reduce the number of alerts and notifications you receive during the day, which can grow to be excessive and stressful. If you do not feel comfortable getting rid of applications, turn off notifications and check in for updates at your leisure., There are numerous communities, online and in countries like the U.S., Canada, Australia, Ireland, and the U.K., centered around the minimalist way of life. Local meetup groups are held in these countries - they offer a unique opportunity to meet other people living the minimalist lifestyle, and to learn more from them. Check for meetings in your area, or look for an online community to reach out to other minimalists.

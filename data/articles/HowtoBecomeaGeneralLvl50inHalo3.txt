 The easiest play list to get a general ranking is in Team Doubles. Unless you have a great group of four players, you should play Double Team. You can play with a friend or not but playing with one is highly recommended.;
, Most circumstances in Halo 3 require you to kill your opponent(s). Since objective based game types are mostly not in Double Team, you should learn how to kill They do appear close to 1/3 of the time though.
 Not as a warm-up but as a lesson. It will teach you how to roam alone and how to deal with 1v1 battles (or more). You can use what you've learned in Lone Wolves and apply it to Double Team. Think about it, if you can defeat 5 other people by yourself, how hard will it be to defeat only 2 people with a teammate?

, Learn each others techniques, strategies, and just become one with your teammate. It sounds a little stupid but it is proven that people who work together, win together.
 Randoms are when you play alone with others you don't know, most the time they never talk and stink. You can communicate with your friends and setup with them. Don't have friends? Try going to mlgpro.com or bungie.net to find someone.
 Finish off each others kills, get map control, communicate, and try not to stress too much over a video game.

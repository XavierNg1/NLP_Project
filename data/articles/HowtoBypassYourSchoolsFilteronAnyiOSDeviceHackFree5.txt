 A Virtual Private Network will let you view blocked websites and use blocked apps. VPNs subscriptions are relatively inexpensive and easy to set up (some are free, but many of those are untrustworthy—try them at your own risk). ExpressVPN, IPVanish and VyprVPN are all safe VPNs to use.
 In your Settings menu, select "General," then "VPN." Choose "Add VPN Configuration," then enter your VPN description, server address and account information (this all comes from your VPN provider and varies from user to user). Turn on the “Send All Traffic” switch.
 Open the Settings screen and turn on the VPN switch.
 You now have access to the whole Internet.

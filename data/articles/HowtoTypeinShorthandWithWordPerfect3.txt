 This consists of creating "hot keys" with partial or complete words. These hotkeys should be given priority over some of the existing ones such as Bold Face (Alt B etc), as they are already assigned to F (Function) keys, or can be.


Some examples: Ctrl A "ation", Ctrl B "because", Ctrl J "just", Ctrl H "that". What your own list will be like will depend entirely on your own work and your own typing.

Eg To assign "ation" to Ctrl A.
, Scroll down to Ctrl A.
 Type "ation", click on "assign keystrokes to key".


OK.



Tip: (a) go through the map and delete all the functions already assigned which you will not need. (b) From here create a "blank" template map which you can then use to create specific keyboard maps for different work requirement. To this blank template assign all the hot keys you think will be common to all your work. (You can change keyboard maps in mid document if necessary).

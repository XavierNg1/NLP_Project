 Women are normal human beings who make mistakes, use the bathroom, have sweaty genitalia, have all kinds of irrational fears and go through the same mental hurdles. Don't put them on a pedestal, or they will most likely walk all over you.

 Ever felt so exhilarated from the inside that you don't care what anyone thinks of you? Ask yourself what gets you into that mode. Getting into that mode will increase your chances to succeed, since when you are in that mode, a shift in your consciousness happens and you don't perceive things as good or bad, just fun. In fact, when you are in that mode rejections make you go even deeper into exhilaration. Below are few things you can try to get into that mode and see what works best for you.


Machine gunning. Approach and talk to bunch of people in a small amount of time. Doesn't matter who; it doesn't have to be girls, just talk to random people.
Pushups. Do push-ups right where you are, busy streets, malls, public places.
Lie down on the sidewalk.
Dance in the middle of street or in front or random people.
Don't just approach all the attractive girls, but approach everyone. It could be guys, bartenders, old people. It's yielding to approach everyone, as it not only keeps you in a social mood but also catalyze the transition from unsocial mood to approaching attractive girls.
 Having some friends is not only attractive to girls, but also helps a lot to keep you in a social mood, which is essential when it comes to attracting girls.

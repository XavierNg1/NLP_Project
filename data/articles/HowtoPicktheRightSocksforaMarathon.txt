 This is very important, as it provides cushion every time you step, softening impact and reducing stress on the heels. For prolonged run, full cushion sole support will reduce your time to recover after the marathon and reduce joint pains after the run.;
, During the run, your feel will sweat and you want a sock that wicks moisture fast and spread out the moisture to dry faster as well as improve cooling. A good material to look out for is Coolmax.
 Denser socks wick more moisture and provide cushion for a longer period of time. They support the feet better, and they often last longer and will not have holes after the marathon.
 Just like shirts, socks come in different sizes and shapes, and though they may stretch somewhat, one-size socks often fit poorly and are a common cause of blistering. If you can feel your sock move up and down your leg, it's causing abrasion. For a Marathon, a good fitting sock in your shoe will prevent blisters from forming.
 A good pair of socks should feel good when you touch it. Soft comfortable socks will also reduce the chance of blisters.
 These allow the sock to grab the arch of the foot, giving a snug feeling. The arch support also helps prevent the sock from bunching up.
 Look for socks with reinforced heels and toes, as these are the areas that wear out the fastest.
 Abrasion do occur during the run, and when you wear your favorite pair of sneakers, there may be existing bacteria and fungi inside. As the marathon is rough on your feet, you may inevitably burst blisters formed and having these socks can prevent an infection.

, This by itself destroys anxiety of the mind (quoted by Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Maharaj). You can compare what the Sakhis say to what you do. If you listen to Guru Arjan Dev Ji Maharaj's life, Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib Ji's life, and Guru Gobind Singh Ji's life especially you will see truth. Sikh History can teach you a lot of things.


If you don't understand punjabi, listen to Sikh2Inspire, BasicsOfSikh, Nirvair khalsa Jatha and Bhai Sukha Singh on soundcloud/youtube. Saints are also very compelling to listen to such as Sant Baba Mann Singh Ji Pehowa Wale- if you are born to an indian family and understand punjabi, Pehwa Wale Sant are very good to listen to as they really empower the true message of God.
 Read/listen to the panj baniya.
 By giving your head to Guru Ji, Guru Ji Maharaj automatically protects you. This is also Quoted in Guru Granth Sahib Ji.
 This is truly blessing and powerful.
 You can ask God for anything but its how much you want/try to get it that matters. Basically, if you want something from God, read sukhmani sahib or any other baniya and then do ardass.
 No one else can really truly help you except from Guru Ji Maharaj. The only one who is true is God. Satnaam- True is his name. Repeat the mool mantar every spare minute you have.

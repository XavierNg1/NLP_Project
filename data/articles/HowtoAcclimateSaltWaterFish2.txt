 Since your fish is acclimated to the pH of its transportation bag's water, you will need to adjust the aquarium's pH accordingly. You can purchase home aquarium pH testing kits from your local pet store or through an online retailer., Once you have a reading of the bag's pH, you'll need to take a reading of your aquarium's pH and raise or lower it as needed. Remember to wear protective gloves and eyewear, as pH chemicals are typically able to burn or corrode any surfaces they come into contact with (including your body).Use sodium bisulfate to lower your aquarium water's pH.
Some experts recommend adding 2.5 grams of sodium bisulfate per 10 gallons of water to reduce the alkalinity by 1.0 pH. You can adjust accordingly to correct your tank's pH.
Dissolve the sodium bisulfate in a cup of fresh, clean water, then transfer it to the tank.
Again, remember to use a quarantine tank if you're introducing a new fish to a tank that already contains fish. Adjusting the pH of a tank full of fish could shock them.
 Once the temperatures are equal, you can transfer your fish from the transportation bag to the aquarium. You should still be floating the transportation bag in the aquarium to adjust the water temperature inside the bag. Use a net to transfer your fish to the aquarium and discard the bag and its water.Over the next few days, bring the tank's pH back to normal by performing 10 to 15 percent water exchanges using fresh salt water every other day.

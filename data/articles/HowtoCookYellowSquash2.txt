 On a cutting board, cut the squash horizontally into long strips that are between 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) to 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick.
 Add the garlic cloves, and cook until the garlic begins to sizzle.
 Season with salt and pepper, and then place the squash onto the grill.
 Add more olive oil if necessary to prevent the squash from sticking to the grill. Squash should be browned and tender when finished.


Serve the squash warm as a side dish or allow them to cool before adding them to a salad.

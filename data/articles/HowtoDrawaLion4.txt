 To the right of it, draw a diagonal line.
 Then, add two rectangles at the bottom of the image.
 Add a half circle around the right side of the circle from step 2. Finally, add a rectangle below the right side of the large trapezoid.
 These will become the nose and the ear, respectively. Then, draw two curved lines for the belly and tail, and add a fourth rectangle.
 Don't forget to draw a mane!

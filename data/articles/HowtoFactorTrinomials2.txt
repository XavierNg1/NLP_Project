 Let's say you need to factor 3x2 + 9x - 30. Look for something that factors into each of the three terms (the "greatest common factor", or GCF).In this case, it's 3:


3x2 = (3)(x2)
9x = (3)(3x)
-30 = (3)(-10)
Therefore, 3x2 + 9x - 30 = (3)(x2+3x-10). We can factor out the new trinomial using the steps in the section above. Our final answer will be (3)(x-2)(x+5).
 Sometimes, the factor might involve variables, or you might need to factor a couple times to find the simplest possible expression. Here are a few examples:


2x2y + 14xy + 24y = (2y)(x2 + 7x + 12)
x4 + 11x3 - 26x2 = (x2)(x2 + 11x - 26)
-x2 + 6x - 9 = (-1)(x2 - 6x + 9)
Don't forget to factor the new trinomial further, using the steps in method 1. Check your work and find similar example problems in the example problems near the bottom of this page.
 Some quadratic trinomials can't be simplified down to the easiest type of problem. Learn how to solve problems like 3x2 + 10x + 8, then practice on your own with the example problems at the bottom of the page:


Set up our answer: (__ __)(__ __)

Our "First" terms will each have an x, and will multiply together to make 3x2. There's only one possible option here: (3x __)(x __).
List factors of 8. Our options are 1 times 8, or 2 times 4.
Test these using the Outside and Inside terms. Note that the order of the factors matter, since the Outside term is being multiplied by 3x instead of x. Try out every possibility until you get an Outside+Inside result of 10x (from the original problem):
(3x+1)(x+8) → 24x+x = 25x no

(3x+8)(x+1) → 3x+8x = 11x no

(3x+2)(x+4) → 12x+2x=14x no

(3x+4)(x+2) → 6x+4x=10x yes This is the correct factor.
 Your math book might surprise you with an equation with a high exponent, such as x4, even after you've used simple factoring to make the problem easier. Try substituting a new variable that turns it into a problem you know how to solve. For example:


x5+13x3+36x
=(x)(x4+13x2+36)
Let's invent a new variable. We'll say y = x2, and plug it in:
(x)(y2+13y+36)
=(x)(y+9)(y+4). Now switch back to using the original variable:
=(x)(x2+9)(x2+4)
=(x)(x±3)(x±2)

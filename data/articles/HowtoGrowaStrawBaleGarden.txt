Bales are readily available at nurseries or farms. Each is about 2 by 3 feet.They typically cost 2 to 7 dollars. Plan on planting 3 to 4 large plants or 6 to 8 small plants in each bale; buy an appropriate number.

Put your bales in an area with good access to sun. Options include patios, balconies, backyards, or driveways. If you are concerned about dirt or debris, put a sheet or a tarp (not black) under the bales.



Straw bales naturally decompose, leading their temperature to rise past what is healthy for growing conditions. Water them several times a day so as to keep them damp. Within a week you should be able to stick your hand inside the bales and note that they are cooler than your body temperature: this means they are ready for plants.



The holes should be 6 in. wide, 6 in. long, and 8 in. deep (15 by 15 by 20 cm).

Straw bales will often contain grass or weed seeds when you purchase them. Try to pick out the seeds if possible; otherwise, be sure to weed regularly.

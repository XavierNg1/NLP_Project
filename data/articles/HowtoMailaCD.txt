 Just walk in and find it among their various packing materials and start folding. Most single-sized CD cases fit in them since they are specifically designed for them. So some sort of protection for the CD prior to this packaging is advisable. Then take it to the counter and pay postage. It's on its way!



 


A cheaper route requires some creativity. Remember the packaging that AOL and various other companies would use to send you promotional CDs? Dump the contents of the metal or plastic packaging they used and fill it with yours. Tape some paper with the proper mailing info to all sides of packaging, attach a stamp and mail it. Remember before you seal the CD in the packaging, protect the information side of the CD if you've burned it yourself (even if you didn't burn it yourself, it is a good idea to protect the information side of the CD from shipping damage).






Another less reliable idea would be to get an envelope or tiny manila folder, insert CD, seal, pay postage, and mail.

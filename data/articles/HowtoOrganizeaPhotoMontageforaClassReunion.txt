 It might sound obvious, but the first step is to gather some photos of your own. Do your best to include lots of different people, and scan your images to make them easy to work with.;
, Once you’ve collected some of your own photos, start reaching out to people you’ve stayed in communication with. (Another great place to start would be the reunion planning committee.)

, If you’ve made it as easy as possible, and you’re still lacking enough images for a decent slide show, you might consider offering a prize or incentive to the person who submits the most photos.
 Striking a balance is key in any photo slide show.
 Figure about 12 slides per minute of music (1 second each for fading in and fading out of each image, and about 3 seconds of viewing time per image), and this should give you an idea of how many songs you’ll need.
 Be sure to test it in a DVD player or on another computer, just to be sure everything is working. You can either use a DVD or hook up a laptop to your rental projector to display your slide show at the appropriate time.

 If it is a dress or outfit, make sure that every zipper is zipped up, buttons are undone, hooks are done up, and ribbons are loosened. Then, turn the tulle inside out. This will prevent tearing and color fading.Loose hooks can get caught on the tulle in the washing machine and cause it to tear.
 It is not absolutely necessary, but it is safer for the tulle if you use a mesh laundry bag. Mesh laundry bags are often used to store dirty clothing, but they can also be put in the washing machine to protect delicate fabric. You can buy mesh laundry bags for fairly cheap at places like Walmart, Target, Dollar Tree, and online at Amazon., Make sure to use a mild detergent when washing tulle in the washing machine. Stronger detergents may remove the stains, but the tulle will probably be damaged. Dreft, Seventh Generation, and All Free and Clear offer mild detergents.Mild detergents do not have any dyes, perfumes, or any harsh chemicals.
 Set the machine to a gentle cycle. Set the time to the shortest time setting possible unless the tulle is excessively dirty. Make sure cold water is being used., You can choose to hang the tulle up to dry on a plastic hanger in an open space. Or, you can tumble dry in low heat. If the tulle is extra delicate, it is better to hang it up to dry.

 This will prevent you from forgetting your race gear or bringing too much stuff. If you are going overseas to the Henley or anything like that, find out whether or not you will be allowed to check any luggage.;
, I recommend a duffel with plenty of pockets, but not so many that you can't fit large items inside of the main compartment. Also pick out a sports bag for taking to the actual event. If owned, a bag with your team/organization's name on it can be helpful if it gets lost. Do bring at least two garbage bags, large enough to store your rowing bag. Label them using duct tape, otherwise they WILL be mistaken for trash.
 Also take a complete sweat suit, preferably with your team's name on it. We're talking sweat pants, a fleece/sweatshirt and a t-shirt. Do pack your sneakers, and at least one other pair of shoes. Bring underwear, sports socks, and, if applicable, sports and regular bras.
 Do remember that even though you are sharing your room with friends, they may not want to share. Take shampoo, body wash, deodorant, toothpaste, a comb, toothbrush, and, if applicable, feminine supplies, makeup, and skincare items. Put your toiletries in a waterproof bag so they won't get all over your clothing.
 You can roll, fold, or pack your clothing in packing cubes. Make sure not to forget your singlet and practice t-shirts, as with most clubs, there is a penalty for forgetting them. Put your toiletries and any accessories like jewelry or purses on top.
 The bus and car rides can be quite long!

, Power bars and such, along with chocolate (at least for me) and the occasional fresh piece of fresh fruit are all great ideas.
 Little things like this will make your experience at the regatta a whole lot better.

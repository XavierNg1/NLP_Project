 Browse the formal wear sold online and in stores at places such as Motherhood Maternity, Due Maternity, A Pea in the Pod and others. Most stores will have a section on evening or formal wear.


Compare what you find to what you have defined as "chic." See if any designs resemble formal wear you have seen in magazines and on celebrities.
 Women are often eager to sell or donate their maternity clothing. You might find a chic find at a consignment shop or even your local Goodwill.



Buy something in a department store or a chic boutique that is a couple of sizes larger than your non-pregnant size. Have it fitted in the areas that it is still too big. For example, when you buy a size that fits your belly, you might need to have the sleeves shortened.
 Try a simple black dress in a stretchy fabric.
 If you have the budget to splurge on your formal wear, ask a seamstress to make you the chic dress you want.
 If you know someone close to your own size who has recently been pregnant, ask if she has any formal wear that you can try on and borrow.

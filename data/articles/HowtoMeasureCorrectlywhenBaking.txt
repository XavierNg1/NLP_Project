Measuring spoons. These come in a range of sizes, from 1/4 tsp. (1.25 ml) up to 1 tbsp. (15 ml).
Measuring glasses. These clear glass containers are marked on the side in increments ranging from 1/4 cup (60 ml) up to 2 cups (480 ml), 3 cups (720 ml) or 4 cups (960 ml). Measuring glasses come with a handle and a pour spout.
Graded measuring cups. These measuring cups come in sets of 4 to 6 cups, each cup representing 1 measuring amount, from 1/4 cup (60 ml) to 1 cup (240 ml).;
,
Spoon ingredients into measuring cups lightly. If the recipe calls for a leveled-off measurement, use a knife to level the ingredient off at the rim of the measuring cup. If the recipe calls for a heaping measurement, do not level the ingredient off; instead, leave a small heap atop the measuring cup.
If the recipe calls for a packed measurement, use a spoon to push the ingredient into the measuring cup either loosely or firmly (according to the directions). A packed ingredient will retain at least some of the shape of its measuring cup after it is dumped into the mixing bowl.
If you are using a measuring spoon for dry ingredients, scoop the dry ingredient with the appropriately sized spoon. Leave it as-is if a heaping spoonful is called for, but use a knife to level it off if a level spoonful is called for.
 Rest the container on a flat surface and view the liquid at eye level to determine that you have accurately filled the container to the correct amount. If your baking measurements require a measuring spoon, simply pour the liquid into the appropriate spoon until it is full.
 Spoon these ingredients into measuring cups, then pack them firmly with a spoon or a rubber spatula to get out any air bubbles.

 Make sure to use a high quality leather cleaner and choose one that has no added oils or waxes.;
, You can use a hair dryer to speed up the drying time.
 If there is a tear all the way through the leather, cut a piece of repair cloth that is 50 percent larger than the rip in each dimension.
 Make sure that the repair cloth is laying flat. A nylon palette knife or pencil will aid you in positioning the cloth accurately.
 Then glue the tear to the repair cloth. Try to leave a concave void (valley) in the torn area that will be later filled. Let the repaired area dry for 4 to 6 hours, or overnight, before applying the next coat.
 Bring the leather repair filler level with the surface.
,Â The drying time will be about 4 to 6 hours per millimetre of leather repair filler.

 If your dog likes to be outside, you should take your older dog to explore a new place. New sights and smells can be invigorating to a dog that only gets to go to the same places all of the time.Taking your dog to a new place doesn't mean that you need to go a long distance. For example, if you normally walk your dog on the same route every day, try switching up that route. New sights and smells in the neighborhood can be just as exciting as the sights and smells a long distance from home.
 If your dog generally gets along with other dogs, it can be very exciting and fun for it to meet a new dog. This can be stimulating and positive for an older dog.The easiest way for your dog to meet other dogs is at a dog park. While you won't be able to easily control what dogs your dog interacts with, your dog will likely get to meet a lot of other dogs.
You can also make a date to meet up with a friend who has a dog. Perhaps you have a friend that has a young dog that needs to be socialized with other dogs. Let your older dog have a fun experience while also helping out a friend with their dog.
 If you are looking for new ways to stimulate your dog, then you should consider teaching it something new. With rewards-based training you can get your dog to do a wide variety of tricks.


Some tricks you might like your dog to do include playing dead, spinning in a circle, or giving you a high five.
Teaching your dog to do tricks will take time and concentration from both you and your dog. The key is repetition and positive reinforcement.

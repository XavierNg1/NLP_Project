 Here you will need to train your brain to rhyme. Try it when you're walking down the street or driving in your car. Rap about the things you see around you. If you don't make sense at first or hesitate, just keep going. Try rhyming about what you're doing or where you're going. After about 30 minutes, you will surprise yourself at what you can come up with.;
,, Try listening to different types and styles of rap music. Then try to find your own style.
, If you do these things daily, you will become a freestyle rapper in no time

, Example: "If you're going to mess with me, you better realize that it's not free, because I can easily rob you off your glee, messing with me has a fee."

, Set yourself up for a good rhyme scheme. Example: Man, it's strong palm down ,punch 'em get 'em strong man. Girls you too but you've never heard a girl put it down like this, kill for.
 You don't always need one, but it helps! It helps the flow sound more enjoyable. Example: 50 cent has a bounce flow, up and down, Jay-Z Flow goes side to side. This is important if you're making hits.
 Count the syllables.
 Get their opinions, and if they have any suggestions write them down. (Get at least three friends' opinions). When you get back to your writing area, redo the song with the suggestions from your friends and then go over it and make sure that the changes keep the flow.

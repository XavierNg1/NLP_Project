In a line, there is a 8 US-quart (8,000 ml) pitcher full of juice and a 3 and 5 quart pitcher, both empty.
There's no "measuring" lines on the containers, as if you put something in a pitcher, you fill it to its maximum volume.
You need to divide the juice between the 5 and 8 quart pitchers, so that each container is holding 4 US quarts (4,000 ml) of juice.;
,


To make things easier, label these by "A" (8 quart), "B" (5 quart), and "C" (3 quart).
 This will give you a 3 US-quart (3,000 ml), 5 quart filled with juice, and an empty 3 US-quart (3,000 ml).
 You'll have a 3 US-quart (3,000 ml), 2 quart, and 3 quart filled.
 You'll have a 6 US-quart (6,000 ml), a 2 US-quart (2,000 ml), and an empty quart.
 You'll have a 6 US-quart (6,000 ml), an empty quart, and a 2 US-quart (2,000 ml).
 You'll have a quart, a 5 quart, and a 2 US-quart (2,000 ml).
 You'll have a quart, a 4 US-quart (4,000 ml), and a 3 quart.
 You'll finally have 4 US quarts (4,000 ml) of juice from the 8 US-quart (8,000 ml) into the first and second containers.

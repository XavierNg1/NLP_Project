 You will need one cup of sea salt, one cup of epsom salt, and one teaspoon of an essential oil of your choice. You can also choose to add dried herbs or flower buds for extra scent; grind these in a food processor to a powder before mixing it with your salts.
 In a bowl, mix the salts together first. Then, slowly add your essential oils. Make sure to spread them thoroughly and to mix well, so that all of your salts come into contact with the oil.
 Keep your bath salts in a sealed container. To use, sprinkle a few tablespoons into warm bathwater and allow time to dissolve. Enjoy!

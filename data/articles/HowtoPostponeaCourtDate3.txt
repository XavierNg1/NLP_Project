 If you desire a postponement of the date because you simply need more time, you can opt to attend and ask the judge for more time on that date.


Check in with the judgeâ€™s clerk when you arrive. Tell them what case you are there for and that you would like to ask the judge for a continuance.
It is always good advice to be punctual, dressed for court, and polite to the judge and all the court employees when attending a court date.
Be sure to bring all documentation that is relevant to both your court date and the reason or reasons for the postponement.
 When the judge calls your case, approach the bench, and explain to the judge why you need more time to prepare your case.
 If the judge allows the continuance, the judge or clerk will give you confirmation, most likely in the form of a court order, of the postponement and the new date.

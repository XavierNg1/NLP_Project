 Spelt flour is available in two varieties: white and whole. White spelt flour has the bran and germ removed so it will provide a lighter texture in baked goods. As a result, it’s the best substitute for all-purpose flour in your favorite recipes.You can usually find white spelt flour at natural food stores and the organic section of traditional grocery stores.;
, That means you don’t need to mix as much liquid into your recipes if you’re substituting spelt. Reducing the amount of liquid ingredients in the recipe by ¼ usually provides the best results.If you’re making a recipe with a liquid that’s hard to reduce, you can increase the amount of flour than you use instead. For example, if you need to add whole eggs, increase the spelt flour by 10 to 15% instead of reducing the amount of the eggs.
 The gluten in spelt flour is different than the gluten in all-purpose flour, so it’s important to handle the dough or batter you make with it accordingly. All-purpose flour can be kneaded or mixed for a long time, but if you overmix spelt batters or doughs, you can wind up with crumbly baked goods. Knead or mix until the dough or batter is just combined.

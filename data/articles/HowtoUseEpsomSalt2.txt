 Annoyed with a family of raccoons feasting on your garbage? Instead of laying down dangerous poison or a trap, use a natural way to keep them away.


Sprinkle Epsom salt on the garbage can lid at night. For added effect, encircle the can with salt--the taste of salt will send raccoons looking for somewhere else to dine.
Consider lining the area where you keep your garbage cans with Epsom salt on an ongoing basis. Eventually the woodland creatures will get the message that dining at your house is off limits.
 Especially during the beginning of the season, when your grass is returning from its winter slumber, add Epsom salt to your watering cycle to return it to its original green, lush state.

Rinse with clean water. Buff floors with a clean towel to reveal a new, bright floor.

Mix 1 tbsp. of Epsom salt to a gallon of water and then sprinkle over plants. Be sure you soak each plant well with the mixture.

 Double-click the Google Earth shortcut icon on the desktop, if you have it there, or run it from the Programs menu.


Once launched, you will see a beautiful 3D rendition of our world.
 Enter the name of the location you want to see the Street View of into the search bar at the top left side of the screen.
 Slide the zoom in/out slider to the right of the screen up to zoom in to the location. You can also adjust your view by dragging the screen or using the arrows at the top of the slider.
 Take the Pegman (you can find it above the slider too), and drag it to the location you want a Street View of. Once you drop the Pegman into the location, the map view will change into the Street View.
 In the Street View image, you will find a small “Report a problem” link at the bottom left corner. Click this and a web browser will open, displaying the “Report Inappropriate Street View” page, which also contains the Street View image you want removed.
 Fill up the form with the required information. You will be asked which part, or parts, of the image you want to be blurred and for what reason. You can indicate that you want your face, your car, your house, or another object blurred. Input your email address so that Google can get back to you, then click the “Submit” button at the bottom of the form.

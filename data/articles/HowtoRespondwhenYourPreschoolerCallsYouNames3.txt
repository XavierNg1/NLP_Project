 Ask yourself whether you ever call other people names. If you do, work on breaking the habit. If you call your child, other family members, or even strangers names, your child will learn that name-calling is an appropriate way to vent frustration, and they’ll be confused when you tell them to stop.If you accidentally let an unkind name slip, call out your own behavior and apologize. Say, “I shouldn’t have said that, even though I’m upset right now. I’m sorry.”

, When you have a conflict with someone, be mindful about how you resolve it. Be proactive about finding a solution, and be willing to compromise. Show your child how to come to an agreement without getting angry or resorting to insults.If you have a particularly good teachable moment in one of your interactions, talk about it with your child afterwards.
For instance, say something like, “Did you notice how your older sister and I talked to each other earlier? We had a disagreement, but we didn’t get mad or call each other names.”

, Use your own emotions to teach your child healthy coping strategies. When you feel down about something, describe your negative emotions, and explain what you’re going to do about them. Invite your child to help you come up with ideas for handling your feelings.For instance, say, “I’m feeling upset that the refrigerator broke, so I’m going to step outside for a minute to calm down. When I come back, maybe we can talk about some other good things to do when we’re upset.”

 If preferred, wear disposable gloves.;
, Aim to make a nice, smooth paste.
 Using a sharp knife, cut out some pieces for the head, body, limbs (four small pieces) and ears.
 Roll into a circle. Taper it by placing your hands together to cause it to taper at the top. If need be, flatten it down a little. The bunny is going to be sitting up, with his legs and paws towards the front.
 These need only a smaller piece of white fondant. Roll the white paste into a ball, then roll it into a small sausage length. At one end, squash it a little between your forefinger and thumb.


Using a little water, dab this where the front legs are to sit and stick in place.
, Use your hands to roll some white fondant into a small ball. Make sure it's evenly shaped. and check that the proportion is correct. You will add the head last.
 Roll the white fondant flat. Using the wheel tool, cut two rabbit's ear shapes. They should be large and floppy but make sure that they're in proportion to the bunny's body.


Use the ball tool to indent where the bunny's ears are to go on the head. Dab a little water into the indent and stick each ear in place. Flop one or both ears over.
 Using a sharp knife, cut lengthways to make two little buck teeth. Again, add water and place on the bottom half of the bunny's face. They should sit slightly at an angle.
 Place a bit of water on the center of the teeth where they join at the top and squash the pink nose into place.
 Again, use pink fondant. Take a pinch of the pink fondant and roll it into a ball. Flatten this with your fingers into a circle. Add to the end of the leg. Repeat for each leg.
 Use the black fondant. Make small round eye and dab into place with a little water.
 Dab a little water in the join spot and gently press on top of the body where the head should be.

 If you're backpacking you should have a high quality pump with a filter, and/or purifying tablets.;
, Deeper areas are preferable since it will be easier to draw out water.
, It should say on the package how many tablets to use per liter.
 Once the tablets have dissolved, bleed the threads. Turn your water bottle upside down with the lid on and carefully loosen the cap until a little bit of water leaks out. This will flush the threads of the bottle with the water that has purification chemicals in it, thereby cleaning the threads which often harbor bacteria.
 Most tablets say to wait for 30 minutes before drinking the purified water, but check carefully to see what the specified waiting period is for your tablets. Even though it may not seem like it, this is critical. One backpacking guide once said "If you don't wait for the tablets to wash your bottle out, they'll wash you out."


After waiting for the specified amount of time, the water should be safe to drink.

 The flesh should be a translucent, white and shiny. It should spring back when you press it. Avoid steaks that look mottled, discolored, or dull.
 Halibut is naturally low in fat, so it can dry out quickly during the cooking process. To prevent this, brush both sides with oil or melted butter before cooking halibut. You can also marinate the fish in oil or a flavored prepared marinade for a few hours before you cook it.
 Only turn the fish when it is halfway done. This will help keep it from breaking apart and will help ensure even cooking throughout the fillet. Turn the halibut over using a wide spatula or turner to make sure you flip the whole fillet.
 The flavor of halibut is delicate and light, so it's important to avoid over-seasoning the fish and losing its natural flavor. Avoid heavy spices or thick sauces. Instead, choose a light sauce or marinade to complement the flavor of the fish.

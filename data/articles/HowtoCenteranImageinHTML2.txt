 You can contain the image within that centered element. However, it will create extra spaces around your element.
 Begin by centering the element. Type <center>.
 Type <img src=”dancingdogpicture.gif” alt=”dancing dog”.
 Enter height=”200”width=”200”> or another size of your choice. This is the end of your image portion of the tag.
 For example, your entire tag would look like this:
<center><img src=”dancingdogpicture.gif” alt=”dancingdog” height=”200” width=”200”></center>.

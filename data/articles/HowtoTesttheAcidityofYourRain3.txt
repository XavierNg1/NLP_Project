 Another method to measure the acidity of a solution is to use a pH meter. This is a specialized piece of laboratory equipment that is expensive and you may not have access to one. If you do have one available, you can use it to determine the exact pH of a solution.For this experiment, you will need:


Rainwater
A pH meter
Calibration buffers (one with pH 7.0 and one with pH 2.0)

, During a rainstorm, place a clean container outside at a height of at least two meters (six-and-a-half feet). Placing the bucket up high prevents dust and dirt from getting into the rainwater. These contaminants can affect the pH of the water.Collect at least one cup (250 mL) of rainwater for measurement.
 Before using a pH meter, it must be calibrated so that it gives you the correct reading of your sample. Each meter is different but the general calibration process is the same. First, rinse the electrode of the meter with water and then place it into a buffer with a known pH of 7.0. Set the readout display to 7.0 so the meter knows that this is what a neutral pH is.Repeat this process with another buffer that is acidic (around pH 2.0).
Some meters may also require that you calibrate with a buffer that is also basic (around pH 10.0).
Always rinse the electrode between solutions.
 Rinse the electrode with distilled water before use. After calibration, you can place the electrode in the rainwater. Once the reading has stabilized on the meter, the display is the pH of the rain.Remember, normal rain has a pH between 5.0 and 5.5. Acid rain is usually in the range of 4.0-4.4.

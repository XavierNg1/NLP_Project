 Choose ones that are unblemished and in their prime. They are best picked when they have just started to come out in bloom.;
, The best time for picking them is the late afternoon before it gets damp in the evening, following a full day's sunshine.
 Hang them upside down when tying.
, Make sure that there is plenty of ventilation.


The darkness is important to help retain the original colour of the bloom.
 The flowers are dried completely when they feel crisp to the touch.

 Unless the professor made a glaring error while grading your assignment or determining your course grade, they are unlikely to change your grade. It is also important to remember that grades are earned, not given. You do not earn a grade based on how hard you work, but rather how well you have mastered the material., In most cases, it is not worth your time or energy to attempt to get a professor to change your grade. The process will suck up valuable time, which can be better spent on future assignments and your other coursework. Before approaching your professor, think about whether it is worth the hassle.
 It’s important that you go over the course syllabus in detail before approaching your professor about the grade you earned. Carefully read every word of the syllabus, paying specific attention to the sections on assignments and how your grade is calculated.For example, if you turned in the assignment late, you should consult the syllabus about the professor’s late assignment policy. This might explain why you earned a particular grade.
 Before you approach a professor about changing your grade, you need to make sure you followed instructions for the assignment in question. Look over the assignment instructions and carefully consider each part of them. Not following instructions is often the reason you did not earn the grade you expected.For example, if the assignment instructions say to turn in a 5-page paper and you only turned in 2 pages, it might explain your grade.
 Before you freak out over a grade, you should carefully read all of the comments that the professor included on the assignment. In most cases, these comments will tell you why you earned a particular grade.If you have trouble reading or understanding your professor’s comments, try asking them to clarify.

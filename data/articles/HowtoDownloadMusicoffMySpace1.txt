 Most sites will give you a trial membership, allowing you to download a couple of songs without signing up for the site.


An example of good membership websites is file2hd.com. For this article, we will download a song using file2hd.;
, File2HD will rip music from some websites for free, but they charge to do it from Myspace. The download will cost between 1.45€ and 8.70€ ($1.91 and $11.50) per month.


Get a free invitation code. File2HD will occasionally post free invite codes to their Twitter feed. Keep an eye on it.
 Search "Premium File2HD" to find the page. Subscriptions are processed via PayPal. If you don't have a PayPal account, learn how to start one.
 Paste the Myspace address into the URL field. Check "I have read and agree to the Terms of Service." Click the Audio bubble at the bottom. Click Get files.
 A list of possible files you could download will appear at the bottom of the page. Check the items you want.
 File2HD will allow you the option to convert files. If you recognize the song you want but notice its file type is something other than MP3, click the convert box. Select "... to MP3" on the next page.
 After you've started the download, it should pop up at the bottom of your page when it's finished. Again, File2HD should default to the Users/Documents/Music folder.

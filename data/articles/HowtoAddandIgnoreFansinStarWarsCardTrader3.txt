 Locate the app on your device. The app icon has the Star Wars logo on it with some cards in the background. Tap on it.
 Tap the exchanging cards icon on the middle part of the bottom toolbar, and you will be brought to the screen with your trades. Tap the title on the header toolbar to see a drop-down list of filters. From the list, tap “All Trades,” and all your trades, with the most recent ones at the top, will be displayed. Swipe up to see more trades.
 On each trade, you can see your trade partner’s username, the current status of the trade, any messages left, the cards being traded, and some action buttons at the bottom. Browse through the trades and find the ones coming from traders or fans you want to ignore. These maybe fans who have offended you by scamming or spamming you.
 Tap the username of the fan you want to ignore, and a menu will appear. Tap “Ignore Trade Offers” from here, and that particular trade—and all future trades coming from the same trader—will be ignored and hidden from you.

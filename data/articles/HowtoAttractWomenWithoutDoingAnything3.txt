 If you don't want to go out and actively get girls, you're going to have to be sure you're going off to do your own thing. Don't hang around waiting for them or send them flowers every week. Just go do your own thing and wait for them to come to you. Some things you can do are:


Hang with your friends. Gotta get in that COD time, after all.
Hang out alone. At last! Peace and quiet! Underwear rock out party time!
Do things you enjoy. This is a great time to develop those skills that girls find so attractive.
 Girls don't want to date someone who's really clingy or controlling. If you have girl friends that you're hoping to catch the eye of, show them that you're perfectly happy to go do your own thing without them. Don't annoy them by constantly asking to hang out, don't ask to go everywhere with them (or follow them around without asking!), don't try to trap them in a corner when you want to talk, and don't try to guilt them or manipulate them into going places with you. Show girls that they are free to go where they want and do what they want, and if they want a buddy along for the ride, you're there for them.
 Start trends, don't follow them. Girls are attracted to guys they perceive as cool. Try to be independent and show your own personality, rather than copying what the other guys are doing.
 This is very important for getting girls to want to date you. Avoid awkward comments or jokes. Keep your eyes on her face. Don't stalk girls. If a few girls decide that you are a creeper, they will probably warn other girls that you are a creeper and then you're just doomed.


A good rule of thumb is that if you wouldn't say something to your mom, don't say it to a girl you're not dating.
 You shouldn't leave girls thinking you're uninterested in dating altogether. Flirt occasionally or find other ways to show that you're interested.

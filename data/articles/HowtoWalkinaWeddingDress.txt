, It is better to be comfortable and safe than it is to add height to your structure. And remember to break your shoes in so that you are not in pain on your big day. If you do decide to wear heels, make sure that you are comfortable doing so and practice as much as necessary so you can glide down the aisle, rather than hobble.
 In order to ensure that this happens, you will have to bring your shoes with you to your fittings.

 Your shoulders should be back, your chin up, and your back straight. By maintaining a perfect posture, you will ensure that the gown is fitted correctly and will hang correctly as you walk. Additionally, a good posture portrays elegance and confidence in a bride.
 If possible, try your dress on too and practice sitting and walking. You can do this as often as it is necessary to feel comfortable.
 You will want to practice this so that you don't bunch up the dress or look like you are hitching up your skirt too high in an unattractive manner.
 If you have done all you can to prepare, then all you can do is take a deep breath and enjoy your day. Don't be too conscious about walking perfectly or standing straight. By doing so, you may end up looking too stiff or artificial. A beautiful bride is a natural one. So do all your stressing, fussing and practicing before the wedding day so that walking in your gown becomes second nature on your big day.

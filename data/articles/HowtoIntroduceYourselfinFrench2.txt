 This is one of the most common questions asked among people meeting for the first time. Since you're not a French speaker, the person you're talking to will probably be even more interested to learn your origins. Use one of the phrases below:



J'habite à ______ (I live in ______): Zhah-beet ah (location)


Je vis à ______ (I live in ______): Zhuh veez ah (location)


Je suis de ______ (I'm from ______): Zhuh swee duh (location)

Put the name of your city, state, or country in the blank. For example, if you're from the U.S. you might say, "Je suis des États-Unis."

, This isn't always a topic of conversation that will come up, but if you're a young person meeting people who are older than you, it's nice to know how to say. Use the easy phrase below:



J'ai ___ ans (I'm ___ years old): Zheh (number) ahn. The final n is very delicate — more or less silent.
Put the number of years old you are in the blank. See our guide to counting in French for help.
 Being able to introduce other people is almost as important as being able to introduce yourself — especially if they're not great French speakers. Use the phrases below to make introductions between people you know and people you don't:Je vous présente ______ (I present you ______): Zhuh voo preh-zont (name and/or title)


Voici ______ (Here is ______): Vwuh-see (name and/or title)

After you say someone's name, you may want to describe your relationship with this person in a few words. For instance, you might say "Voici Emma, ma femme" ("Here is Emma, my wife").
 Once introductions are out of the way, the conversation itself can commence. Below are just a few basic questions you may want to have ready — you don't need to be perfectly fluent to show you're interested in learning more about the person you're meeting.



Comment vous appelez-vous? (What is your name?): Co-mahnt vooz ah-play-voo?


D'où êtes-vous ? (Where are you from?): Doo eht-voo?Quel est votre profession? (What do you do for a living?): Kell ay vote-ruh pro-fess-yone?


Comment allez-vous? (How are you?): Co-mahnt ah-lay-voo?

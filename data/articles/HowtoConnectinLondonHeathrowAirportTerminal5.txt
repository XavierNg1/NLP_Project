 LHR is a very, very big airport and it can sometimes take quite a while to get from one point to another. Be prepared for anything and plan at least a 3 hour layover.;
, When you check in at your origin city, your bags will be checked all the way through to your final destination. Connecting passengers in LHR do not claim their bags. Contrary to popular belief, LHR is not terrible with checked bags. The odds of your bags making it from one flight to another in LHR and onto your final destination are excellent.
 Your connecting boarding passes will have been issued in your origin city. Don't lose them.
 Your checked bags will be unloaded and transferred to your connecting flight.


Sometimes, it can be a very long walk to the flight connections area. Depending on where your flight has arrived, you may need to ride the train.
 Wait until you are called forward by an agent. Present your connecting boarding pass to the agent behind the desk. It will be scanned, and the agent will verify that you have enough time to make it to your connecting flight, as well as other information.
 Proceed upstairs to security screening. Follow the directions from the agents, and proceed through. The process here is just like any other US Airport.
 Check the monitors for your connecting flight. You will notice that your flight has not been assigned a gate yet. There are lots of seating areas and things to do while you wait for your gate assignment.
 Follow the steps below to get to your departure gate.


If your flight is departing from an A Gate - simply follow the signs to your flight's gate. If your gate is A10, take the escalator or elevator down one level to the ground floor of the airport. You will be brought to your aircraft by shuttle bus.
If your flight is departing from a B Gate - take the escalator or elevator down to the train. You will ride this train to the B gates.
 Have a great flight!

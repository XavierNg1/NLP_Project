 When writing your job reference page you want to include in each entry the referee’s name, job title, company name and address, company contact telephone number and email address.Afterwards add a sentence about how you know the reference. For example:


Jane Doe,
Manager at Pro Writing Services
555 Dorado Avenue, NY, 55788
Contact telephone – 00 243 6785 9345
Email address – Janedoe@prowritingservices.com
Jane Doe was my employer at Imaginary Writing Business.;
, Make sure that each reference’s name, and all of their information, is spelled correctly. You do not want a potential employer contacting you and telling you that they reached a pizza place rather than your university's president., When writing your job reference page, make sure it is in the same format as your resume. However, there is no need to give your job reference page with every resume or job application; it should remain separate from your resume.


You can write at the end of your resume ‘references available on request’.
 During the hiring process, potential new employers will check references at the later stages, when they are considering giving you the job. They will not be checking every applicant’s references before they shortlist. Your reference page should be given selectively to avoid your referees being contacted unnecessarily.


Take a copy along with you to any interviews that you go to, just in case you are asked to provide references right then and there.

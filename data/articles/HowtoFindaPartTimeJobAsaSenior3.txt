 If you love kids, it might be a great time in your life to make some money from that love. You can offer your services as a sitter to friends and family, or you could even run a small daycare in your home., Senior greeters at grocery and retail stores have become a cliche for a reason. Stores benefit because you're making customers feel welcome, and it's a relatively fun and easy job for you. Check with stores in your area to see if they're hiring for greeter positions., Another part-time job you can look into is being a guide at a local museum. You'll need to learn a spiel to tell your guests, but it can be a fun, engaging job. Often, museums are looking to hire people on a part-time basis., If you've been fixing things around your house for years, you might find that a perfect solution to your cash-flow needs is fixing things for other people. Of course, you'll need to know your limits, but if you can fix basic things, try using word of mouth to get people to hire you., Many companies are popping up that let you choose when you want to work each week. Mostly, these are errand-running or driving companies, such as Uber, Task Rabbit, Lyft, Postmates, and Shipt. Most of these companies use smartphones to connect with both their workforce and their customers, so you must be somewhat tech-savvy to work this type of position.

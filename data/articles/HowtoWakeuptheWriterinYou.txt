 Research all of these stories and select the one that interests you the most and write down the key points in your journal.;
,, Now forget them. Every one of them. Crazy as it seems, it's pretty much crucial to getting in the writing mood.
 I like to think that fresh air gives lead to fresh ideas; old air to not-so-fresh ideas.
 Or listen to your iPod or Walkman or even portable radio if your a little shy. But turn it to music that makes you feel empowered.
, But from this point on, the story you chose is going to be the base for your entire novel/novella/short story. (Feel free to change it, if you think another would be more well-suited.)

, Try to use characters in your previous writings that were interesting, but whose stories never were successful. But don't make them major characters. Feel free to borrow the general personality of a character you really liked from a book that was not your own, but your homework is, however, to give them your own magic touch. You might want to do this by making them have a few more traits: for every flaw they have however, they must have a strength. This is true to any human you'll ever meet!

, You might want to read a little Shakespeare, especially his comedies, or at least watch a movie based on one of his plays to learn what a great subplot is.
 I hope you are writing all your ideas down on several organized pages in your journal.
 Put the surviving ideas together in a "collage" of good ideas, along with a few powerful quotes from good books you have read, and a summary of your historical story. Make it readable, since it's going to be your reference point from now on.
 Don't forget to write down the great ideas you get in doing so!

, Put down a minimum of pages you have to write everyday. Decide not to change the plot mid-way, instead, change it during revision.

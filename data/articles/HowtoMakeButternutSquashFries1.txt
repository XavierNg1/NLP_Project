 Add 1 quart (946 ml) of vegetable oil to a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Attach a deep fry thermometer to the pot, and heat the oil over medium-high until it reaches 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).You can substitute peanut oil for the vegetable oil if you prefer.
A candy thermometer will also work to monitor the temperature of the oil.;
, For the fries, you’ll need 1 butternut squash that’s been peeled and seeded. Use a sharp knife to slice it into sticks that are approximately ½-inch (13-mm) thick.A vegetable peeler works well to remove the skin from the butternut squash.
To remove the seeds from inside the squash, you usually only need a regular spoon.
 Once the oil is hot enough and you’ve cut the butternut squash, add the fries to the oil in batches. Allow the squash to cook until they become golden brown and crisp, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.Be careful not to add too many fries to the oil at once or the temperature may drop.
Use a wooden spoon to stir the fries gently while they’re frying. That will help ensure that they cook evenly on all sides.
 When the butternut squash fries are golden brown and crisp, use a slotted wooden spoon to lift them out of the oil. Transfer them to a plate lined with paper towel to get rid of the excess oil., After you’ve drained the butternut squash fries, place them on a platter. Season them with kosher salt to taste, and serve while they are still warm.You can serve the fries with ketchup or your favorite fry dipping sauce.

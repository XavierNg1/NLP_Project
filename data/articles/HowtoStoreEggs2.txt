 Crack the eggs you wish to freeze and pour the whites into a freezer-safe airtight container. Sift out the yolks—these should be placed in a separate container. Take care not to puncture the yolks while cracking and sifting the eggs.Protect separated egg yolks by refrigerating them in a bowl cold water.Storing the white and yolks separately will make them easier to use as needed in culinary projects.
 Alternately, you can just as easily freeze whole eggs without the need to separate them first. Simply whip the eggs until they’re completely integrated, then transfer them to the freezing container When properly frozen, whole eggs will usually stay fresh for up to a year.Freezing eggs whole can be a more space-effective storage solution.
 Eggs yolks have a tendency to harden into a thick gel when frozen. You can avoid this by mixing in a small amount of salt or sugar, which will keep the yolks from congealing. These additives make it more difficult for the proteins in the yolks to bond and solidify in low temperatures.Generally, you should aim to incorporate about ⅛ teaspoon of salt and 1 ½ teaspoons of sugar for every ¼ cup of eggs (about four large eggs).Use salt for eggs that are destined for savory dishes and sugar for those that will go into desserts and other sweet confections.
 As previously mentioned, the container you choose to freeze eggs should be one with a lid that makes it completely airtight. Otherwise, moisture may enter or escape from the container, potentially ruining the eggs. A lidded piece of Tupperware or similar container will work best for this purpose.If you happen to run low on spare storage containers, you can portion the yolks or white into an ordinary ice cube tray.Freezer bags aren’t recommended, as they can easily burst and create a mess. Should you be forced to use a freezer bag, make sure it’s securely sealed and that you’ve pressed out all excess air before closing it.

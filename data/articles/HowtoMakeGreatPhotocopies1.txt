 Make sure the original is in good condition. Crisp and clean originals will make the best copies. When possible print originals on heavy weight paper from an inkjet or laser printer so they are fresh and of a high, clear quality.


Undo any folds or creases. These may interfere with copy clarity. These do not transfer well to copies and can obstruct copy text or images. Remove staples, tape, torn pages, etc. before making copies. Smooth paper feeds easily through the machine and has less chance of getting jammed or damaged.;
, Foreign objects like dust or dirt on the glass can cause blemishes on your copies. Cleaning glass thoroughly can make for a cleaner copy.


Unplug the machine to start cleaning the glass. Then apply a small amount of glass cleaner to a soft sponge and gently wipe away dirt. Dry immediately with a lint free cloth. Remember to never apply liquid directly to the glass as this can leak into the machine and cause expensive damage. , Cautious handling of the copy machine simplifies the photocopying process, saves time, and prevents waste, poor quality copies, and machine damage.


Avoid placing fingertips directly on the copy glass. This prevents transfer of dirt and oils from your hand to the machine.
Never place sticky-notes over an original. The residue of the sticky part can attract dirt that will harm both the original and the machine.

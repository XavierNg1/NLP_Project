 You will need to consider the horizontal space below the tree as well as the tree limbs, branches and trunk. Keep the following parameters in mind:


The tree's root system extends horizontally in all directions approximately as far as its height. Measure this area away from your tree and mark it with a stake.
You must aim to protect at least 50 percent of the root system from construction vehicles in order to ensure the tree will be safe. Measure approximately half of the length of the tree and mark it with a stake on each side. This is the area you will need to protect.
 Most construction takes place during the warm spring, summer or fall months. During summer, trees need to have the soil around their roots saturated every 1 to 2 weeks.
 You will also need some netting to string around those posts. Bright orange netting will advertise an extra need for caution around the area.



For trees that have been planted 1 to 4 years ago, the barricade should extend just beyond the branches and leaves of the tree. This is called the drip line.
For trees that are older, the barricade should extend 1 extra foot for every inch of the trunk's diameter in all directions.
 This layer should be approximately 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2Â cm) deep.
 This can help to warn construction crews, and it will reduce the likelihood of damage from machinery.

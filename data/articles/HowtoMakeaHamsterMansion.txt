 Buy tubes and little toys (non-toxic), or you can make them yourself. Make sure the cage is at least 360 sq inches of floor space, which is the minimum for hamster cages. Keep in mind that the majority of cages sold at pet stores are far too small and really costly.;
,,, Make sure your dream house is safe but fun for you hamster and make sure it can't escape.
,, Make one room like a kitchen. Fill it with shredded paper, mixed treats, and food in with it. Make another room with one hole in a dead end that could be a bedroom filled it with some kind of bedding. Another room can be a living room with the water bottles in it and something for the hamster to crawl on like furniture. Add another room with the exercise wheel, then a play room. Let your imagination go wild. Its up to you!

 Each cup is filled about halfway with beer. There is a team of two beer pong players on each side of the beer pong table and no paddles are used. Instead, one team starts the game by each person tossing a beer pong ball and trying to get it into one of the cups. If you get the ball into one of the opposing team’s cups, one member of the opposing team drinks the beer in that cup, team members alternate who drink’s the beer every time the other team gets a ball in their cup. Once the beer is drunk from that cup, the cup is placed aside and out of the triangle. Once the team has taken their two shots at the cups, the other team shoots back, and it goes on like that. The point of the game is to eliminate all of the other team’s cups. The shot must be direct, and cannot bounce off the beer pong table and then go into the cup. Also, if both members of a team make their shots consecutively, the 2 balls are returned to that team and they get another chance. We used to play by your rules, but found this game to be much more competitive and fun. And it doesn't take a blackjack game genius to figure it out.

 Your left foot should be forward and your left knee bent. Your right leg is back and completely straight.You will be kicking with your right (rear) leg.


Your left foot will remain planted on the ground.Keep your back and torso erect.
Straighten your shoulders and face forward.
 As you lift and bend your right knee, pull your right foot off the ground. Stop when your right heel is at the same height as your left knee. Keep your toes retracted – do not point them down.Keep your left foot firmly on the ground.
All of your weight should now be on the left leg.
Continue to keep your left knee slightly bent. This will help you with balance.
 Lean back slightly as you thrust your hips forward in a swinging motion. Starting with your big toe, kick your right foot forward quickly, with a snapping motion.When your right foot is almost at maximum extension, start pulling your hips back into their normal position.


The striking surface is the ball of the foot. Continue to keep your toes retracted.
Don’t attempt to kick as high as you can. Work up to that.
For now, start with a lower level kick that comes naturally to you., Your knee is essentially acting like a hinge. Bring your hips back into a normal position and pull the foot back very quickly.


The overall effect of the kick is similar to a towel snapping.End the kick by placing your right foot back on the ground in the starting position.

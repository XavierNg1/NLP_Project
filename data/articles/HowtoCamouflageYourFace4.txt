 You can buy them on Amazon for about $10. They come in many different forms, from full masks that only have eye holes to a bandana-style mask that covers the lower part of your face. The best mask for you depends on what you will use it for, but for best coverage, buy a full face mask that only has eye holes. Just make sure it allows for full peripheral vision so that you can see clearly., For example, choose one with leaves if you will be in a forest. You can choose one in a color that matches your surroundings as well, like brown if you will be in a forest with bare trees, or green if your surroundings will have a lot of foliage. You can also buy one with a combination of greens and browns, with leaf and grass patterns.The best camouflage will come from a mask with a realistic pattern rather than a standard color pattern in camo. The advantage of masks is that you can make your face look exactly like nature rather than just similar in color.
If you are going out at night in a dark area, an all black mask will work well.
 There are many masks to choose from. Take a look at several to compare and contrast. Pay attention to the color and pattern. You don’t need to worry too much about size because most masks are one size fits all. Many are polyester or spandex for breathability, but you could also get one made of neoprene for added warmth., No other preparation is needed. A mask is instant camouflage! Just make sure it fits securely so that it won’t fall off.

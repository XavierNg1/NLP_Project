 Depending on the type of board you've made, use poster tack, pins, magnets or tape to place images onto the board.
 As touched on above, it's a good idea to have a theme for your Pinterest-inspired real life board. You may want to make a plan digitally first by searching Pinterest or using your own Pinterest board, followed by printing off the final choices. Some things to bear in mind when creating your real life Pinterest board include:


Consider how often you'll change/rotate the images. This may impact what is placed where and what theme you'll have––you could go with "theme of the month" if space is tight but you'd like to vary the board's contents often.
Consider printing quality––these are for display, so the best printing possible should be aimed for.
Consider grouping images based on colors. This is often done on Pinterest and it may be ideal for complementing your décor or inspiring a cooking or crafting project.

 Look for the game app on your device. Its name is PvZ 2 with the app icon of a zombie’s face. Tap on it.
 This will bring you to the Zen Garden where you can grow plants equipped with plant food.
 If you have an empty pot, tap on it to plant a plant. A random plant will be placed there. The plant will start as a baby or mini version of the plant.
 Whenever you see a water droplet beside the plants, it means it’s time to water them. Tap on them to bring out the watering can.
 The plants in the Zen Garden grow. Each time they grow, they give out coins as a reward for taking care of them. The plants’ growth is time-based, meaning you have to wait for the countdown to finish before they grow and before you can use them.
 Once a plant reaches its next growth point, it will release some coins for you to collect. Tap on the coins to add them to your coin bank. When a plant reaches its maturity and it’s now ready for use, it will release some gold coins.

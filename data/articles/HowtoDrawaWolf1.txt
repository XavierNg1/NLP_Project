Draw a bean-shaped elongated oval for the body.
Make sure that you are using a pencil for the draft sketch so you can erase it afterwards to make it neat.;
,


Draw a circle at the one end of the bean, this will be the head.
For the hind joints, draw two overlapping circles. One should be smaller because it’s for the hind leg that is not in full view from the angle.
At around the chest part of the wolf, add a slightly elongated circle for the fore legs.



Draw a two pointed curves on top of the head for the ears. Unlike foxes, wolf ears are smaller.
To work out the neck (or the scruff) just draw two slightly curved lines and connect both sides of the head to the bean-shaped body.



For the hind legs, start by drawing curved lines from the leg joint. The lines should bend outwards towards the tail part of the wolf.
For the fore legs, you can just add 2 thick lowercase “l”. Since one of the wolf’s legs is hidden, only a small part of the other leg could be seen.
For the muzzle, add a small letter “U” at the head.



For the eyes, just add two small tear-shaped figures above the muzzle.
Finish the hind leg by adding a similar shape to the one you did earlier but this time, add some small paws at the end of the legs.
The tail is hardly seen because it’s hidden behind the hind legs. Because of that, you can just add a long curvy line at the end of the bean-shaped body.
You should have the basic drawing skeleton now.



Put in mind the overlapping lines and parts that should be hidden.
Remember to use fuzzy-looking crooked lines to get the wolf’s furry look.
The line art might not look perfect and crisp but it should look neat when the pencil is erased.



You can add details like the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, paws, claws and fur.
You can also add extra lines to emphasize the paw and the fur.



Depending on the breed, wolves can go in different shades from gray to brown or even white.

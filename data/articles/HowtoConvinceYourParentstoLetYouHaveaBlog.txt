 Explain what you will write about, how you will write about it, and why you want to do it. The clearer you are to your parents, the more reassuring you will be.;
, Parents tend to worry about young people sharing compromising information, cyber-bullying, and posting information that can come back to haunt them. Learn what to avoid, and explain this to your parents. This will reassure them that you are aware that blogs can be used in bad ways, and you will not do that.
 You will use your writing skills. You will network with people throughout the world. Maybe you'll discuss ideas, problem-solve, and share with others. If you're shy, it can help you open up to others. These "educational" angles can help persuade a parent.
 Yes, you could possibly go behind their backs, but to convince your parents you are trustworthy, ask them if having a blog is OK. You will, of course, give them full access.
 Encourage your parents to read your blog. Seriously. If you are open and honest, they are very likely to encourage your blog. In fact, why not invite your Grandma, your cousins, your uncle, and so on to your blog? You might find out that your family likes to hear about you! Create the content for the first few posts and show them. Ask them about their responses and what do they think about it. Ask them about possible inputs and what they think that should be there in the blog.
 Ask your parents if they might want to blog. Maybe it'll turn out that they enjoy writing about their lives and see how fun, useful, and educational a blog can be. And who knows--maybe you'll discover some neat things about your parents?

, Try free blogger sites like WordPress.org or blogger.com. (But beware---if your parent find out you disobeyed, you're in trouble!)

 Operate a roll-around sphere tumbler by placing the compost inside and periodically rolling the sphere around the yard to aerate and mix the compost.


Roll-around spheres are relatively inexpensive but are awkward to roll and the hardest type of tumbler to empty. The more material inside the sphere, the harder it is to tumble the sphere around the yard.
An advantage of base-rolling drums and roll-around spheres is that you can roll the tumblers to wherever you want to apply the compost.

 Don’t be embarrassed if you receive negative feedback. Remember that giving constructive feedback is a sign that the person is invested in you.Constructive feedback can sound something like, “I thought your presentation went well. However, I wanted to see more specific numbers regarding oil price predictions. Could you make sure to include those in the future?”

, Never be afraid to ask to for something you want. It is important to do it in a way that is not rude or impertinent. However, it is possible you will hear a yes. If you don’t ask, you will definitely not receive what you want.For example, you may want to adjust your work hours to attend a class to expand your skills. You may choose to phrase your request as, “Would it be possible to for me to take an evening course to learn SQL? I would need to leave work at 6PM on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I am happy to stay later the other nights.”

, A part of growing your confidence is acting like you are confident. You do not need to be arrogant or constantly brag. However, you should believe that you are able to leverage your abilities to successfully complete new tasks.Your response to a request may sound something like, “Great! I can try to make those design changes for you. My Javascript skills are not strong, but I know I can use my PHP skills to figure out how to get the task done.”

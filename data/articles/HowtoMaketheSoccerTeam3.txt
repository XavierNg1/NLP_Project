 This will help a lot with communication if the team doesn't have an designated manager and doesn't play in an official league.
 In casual teams, one of the most important things is that you all get on with each other and can work well together as a team.
 It is accepted that you will miss some training and possibly even matches due to work or school commitments and the odd special occasion, but you should try to turn up as often as possible. This will send a message, that you are committed and reliable.

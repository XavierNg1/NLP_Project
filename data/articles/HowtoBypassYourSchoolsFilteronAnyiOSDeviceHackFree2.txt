 If your school hasn’t blocked it, you can bypass their filters by using the Tor network. iOS users can use the Tor network by installing Onion Browser from the app store. You can do this from any network.
 Start Onion Browser and try to visit any website. If you are able to pull up regular sites like Google or Apple, you’ll be able to use this method.
 As long the Tor network isn’t blocked, you can access any website—even those sites blocked by your school.

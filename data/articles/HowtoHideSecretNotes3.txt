 With markers, one of the easiest ways to do this is pry the back (non writing end) off with a staple remover. You can also use a knife, your teeth, or any other implement than can get under the back of the marker. Pens can usually just be unscrewed. This also works (and is often easier) with highlighters.
 Inside of the pen or marker there will be an ink stick. You'll need to remove this. Keep it and place it to the side.
 If you have a larger note, you might just put the note where the ink stick used to be. If it is smaller or if your paper is thin, you can wrap it around the ink stick and replace the ink stick.


If you don't replace the ink stick, you can either discard it or save it for use later.
 Put the part that you unscrewed or pried off back on.Gently try to close it evenly without crushing it. Causing damage to it can make it harder to open. Pass it to the recipient.

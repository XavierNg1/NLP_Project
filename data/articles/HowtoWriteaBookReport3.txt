 You should have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Make sure that the paragraphs support your introduction, especially if you have an opinion or thesis statement there.


Make sure there are logical transitions between your points. Your paragraphs should flow into each other, but sentences should flow into each other, too.
Look over the paper your teacher gave you. Have you met all the requirements and stipulations? Is it the proper format?

, Spellcheck misses typos all the time. Better yet, give yourself a break and have somebody else proofread your work, too. Sometimes a new pair of eyes sees different mistakes.


In addition to having a friend correct your work for spelling, punctuation, and grammar mistakes, ask them about the content. Does everything make sense? Does it flow? Are they captivated?

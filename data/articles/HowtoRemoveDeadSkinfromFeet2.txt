 One of the most basic solutions is to soak feet for long enough to soften the dead skin and scrub it off with a pumice stone or foot brush. Fill a foot bath or small tub with enough water to cover the tops of your feet and soak for 20 minutes. Gently scrub the dead skin off of your feet.


This is best done gently because you don’t want to expose too much raw skin or your feet will hurt. Scrub a little off at a time and repeat over the course of a few days.
 In a small plastic tub, pour enough lemon juice to cover the bottoms of your feet. If you don’t have enough lemon juice for this, it is okay to dilute with an equal amount of warm water. Soak for ten minutes then rinse and pat dry.Undiluted lemon juice will give your feet a stronger treatment than if you dilute it with water.
Make sure you don’t have any cuts or open sores on your feet as the acid in lemon juice will cause extreme burning in those areas.
 Fill a foot bath, or small plastic container, half-full with warm to slightly hot water. Add a half cup (118.3 ml) of Epsom salt to the water. Soak feet for 10 minutes. Gently rub with a pumice stone to remove dead skin that the soak has loosened.The works best if you repeat it every two to three days to avoid feet becoming dry again. It may take a few days of soaks to notice a big difference in the skin on your feet.
 The acidic nature of both white vinegar and apple cider vinegar make them great for removing dead skin. In a foot bath, or small plastic tub, mix equal parts vinegar and mild hot water. For the best results, soak feet for around 45 minutes and gently rub with a pumice afterward.Another way to use this solution is to soak your feet in the vinegar and water mixture for about five minutes and then soak in pure apple cider vinegar for 15 minutes. This makes for a stronger soak than diluted vinegar.

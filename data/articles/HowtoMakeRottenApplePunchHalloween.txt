;
, Pour the grape Kool-Aid into the ice cube tray, covering the gummy worms.
 Allow to sit until the ice cubes are frozen. These form the rotten apples.
 Refrigerate for the same time as the ice cubes are freezing.
 Pour the lime Kool-Aid into glasses. Remove the ice cubes from the freezer. Add a few ice cubes (also known as rotten apples) into each glass. As the ice cubes melt, the drink will change color and look like rotten apple punch.
 Fill to 1/2 an inch/1 centimeter (0.4Â in) from the top, then leave space.
 Stir to combine well.
 Hang each gummy worm slightly over the edge, with most of the worm in the liquid still. Space the worms at even intervals around the dish.
 Leave to freeze solid.
, To free them from the dish, sit the base of the dishes in a shallow sink or bowl of warm water. They will start to melt quickly, so don't leave them in there too long.
 They will immediately start to float.
 The rotten apple cider punch is now ready for serving.

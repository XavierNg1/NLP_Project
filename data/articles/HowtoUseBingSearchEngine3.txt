 If your words are misspelled, Bing may look for websites that contain your keywords in their misspelled form, which can result in unreliable or unprofessional web pages.
 This practice can provide you with search results that are closely aligned to the information you want. For example, enter a specific keyword phrase such as "grizzly bear attacks in Alaska" instead of "bear attacks," which may display results about attacks by multiple breeds of bears all over the world.
 For example, if you want to read about the breed of mustang horses, but not mustang cars, enter "mustang horse NOT car" into the search engine to locate web pages that do not mention mustang cars.
 Bing will only display results that contain the exact keywords you have entered. For example, if you are having difficulty finding websites that sell diaries, perform a search for websites that sell "journals" or "notebooks" instead.


Review the "Related Searches" located to the left of your search results for additional keyword suggestions provided to you by Bing. In some cases, you may be able to find and use keyword combinations that are more effective in your search.
 For example, if you want to find websites that contain job offers for freelance journalists, place a specific search phrase in quotation marks such as "freelance journalist wanted" or "freelance journalist needed."

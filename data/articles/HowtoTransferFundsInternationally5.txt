 There are several companies, such as Akimbo, that offer prepaid debit cards with the capability of sending money abroad.Each brand of prepaid card will have its own set of fess associated with its use, but at the minimum, expect an activation fee. Some card also charge fees for loading money onto the card and withdrawing money from it.


There are two ways to use a prepaid card to send money abroad. You can buy a Visa or Mastercard gift card with international capabilities that has a finite, non-replenishable amount on the card. Or you can use a card that allows you to set up a large, replenishable account that allows users with sub-account cards to withdraw from it.
 The type of card you use will dictate the ways that you can add money to it. Of course, all of them accept cash. However, some replenishable cards even allow you to transfer money onto the card directly from a bank account.
 If you are using either one prepaid card or a card with sub-accounts, you will need to send the card to the recipient or recipients. Use the postal service or a private carrier like DHL, UPS, or FedEX. Be sure to investigate withdrawal limits and transaction fees, as there is often a daily limit for the number of transactions or amount of money that can be withdrawn.

 Try to make your two papers the same size because they will go back to back for both sides of the bookmark.
 The size of the arrow should be the size of your bookmark., Opt for a different color than the bookmark so it stands out. Express yourself. Write your name on the bookmark. Draw something you love doing. This is the part where you really have to use your imagination to decorate your bookmark., The decorated part of each rectangles should be facing out. When you look at both sides of your bookmark, one side should be colored and so should the other. Line up the two papers until it looks like one rectangle.

Your arrow should not be included in this step. Lay your arrow aside.
 On the rectangles, there are four sides. You are stapling the rectangles together, but we are only stapling three out of four sides. You are going to make a pocket for the arrow to sit inside of the bookmark. Staple all around both long sides of the rectangle, but make sure to keep the short sides unstapled., You have now stapled three sides. Two long sides and one short side. Your two rectangles should be one bookmark and there should be a small pocket on the unstapled side., Your arrow should be inside of the bookmark. Take some tape and when your arrow is inside of the bookmark, tape the very end of the arrow to the other side of the bookmark so it doesn't fall out., This is for the arrow., The end of the arrow is taped to the other side. Take your bobby pin and pin the pointing side of the arrow down so it won't fall off. You are done! Have fun with your new paper bookmark!

 The hepatitis A vaccine is used to prevent and lower the risk of acquiring the disease. It is administered through an injection into the muscles, and requires no special preparation. Those who are good candidates for this vaccination are:


Children 1-2 years in age.
People traveling to places with a high prevalence of hepatitis A including Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe.
People who live in areas with a high incidence rate of hepatitis A.
Men with male sexual partners.
People who come into frequent contact with needles, whether for drug use or medical purposes.
Those who come into any sort of intimate contact with people from areas prone to hepatitis A infections.
 Like the hepatitis A vaccine, the hepatitis B vaccine is injected directly into the muscle and requires no special preparation. Good candidates for this vaccination include:


Recently born babies. Be aware that babies receive hepatitis B vaccinations in three doses: at the time of birth, at 1-2 months old, and again at 6-18 months old.
People younger than 18 years old, but who never received the vaccination as babies.
Those whose sexual partners may have hepatitis B.
People traveling to places with high incidence rates of hepatitis B.
Adults who have never received the vaccination, but who want to protect against the disease. Be aware that adult hepatitis B vaccinations come in three doses: the second dose is given four weeks after the first dose, and the third dose comes five months after the second dose.
 Additionally, despite being found worldwide, hepatitis E has low prevalence in developed countries, so infection in places such as the United States is rare., A hepatitis immunoglobulin shot contains antibodies that destroy certain strains of hepatitis.


Because of this, it can be an effective form of treatment if given to a person within 2 weeks of coming into contact with the hepatitis A virus.
It can also help control some outbreaks of the disease.

Make sure that the information is correct. If SUSI receives false information they will request more information and the process will be extended. This may delay your payments.
 After a couple of weeks from your online application, SUSI will send you forms to complete to confirm your household income., If your application has been successful and you have chosen a course, complete the final course acceptance form.

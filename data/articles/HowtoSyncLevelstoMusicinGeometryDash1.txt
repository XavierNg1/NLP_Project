 Geometry Dash currently allows music from that website, so you should find some great songs there.
 It's easier to sync the level to the music first instead of syncing a level to music., When you select the music and difficulty for your level, you should see a button saying "Custom Songs". Click on that button, then enter the ID and you're good to go!

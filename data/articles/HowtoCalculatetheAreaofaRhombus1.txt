 The diagonals of a rhombus are the lines that connect the opposite vertices (corners) in the center of the shape. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular and form four right triangles through their intersection.


Let's say the diagonals are 6 cm. and 8 cm. long.;
, Just write down the length of the diagonals and multiply them. In this case, 6 cm x 8 cm = 48 cm2. Don't forget to square the units since you're working in square units.
 Since 6 cm x 8 cm = 48 cm2, just divide the result by 2. 48 cm2/2 = 24 cm2. The area of the rhombus is 24 cm2.

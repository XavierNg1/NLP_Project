 You will need the following: A muffin or cupcake tin.
Cupcake wrappers.
Ziplock bags
An ice cream scooper

, You will use this to freeze the batter into individual cupcakes.There is no need to grease the pan or wrappers, as you won't be baking these yet.
You can double up the cupcake wrappers if you are working with a thick or heavy batter.
Fill the whole cupcake pan. If you end up not using all of the cupcake wrappers, you can always put them back into the package to use later.
 You can use the ice cream scooper to do this.Try not to fill each wrapper more than 2/3 full.
Once you have used up all of your batter, place the muffin tin with the filled wrappers into a freezer on an empty shelf or basket.
After 24 hours, check to see if the batter is fully frozen.
 This is how you will store the frozen cupcakes.Squeeze any excess air from the bag. This will help you to save space in your freezer and will help to reduce the risk of freezer burn on your frozen cupcake batter.
Put the muffin tin away.
Freeze the batter for up to 3 months.
 You can thaw as many or as few as you want.Place the filled cupcake wrappers in a muffin tin before you thaw them.
Once thawed, bake at 350 degrees in the oven.
Increase baking time by 2 minutes from your original recipe.

 Add 10 to 15 drops of lemon or tea tree oil to two cups of white vinegar in a bowl. Lightly stir the solution to combine the oil and vinegar.Commercial leather conditioner can be used in place of a homemade solution. Read the label on the product to ensure proper use.
Avoid using olive oil as it can damage the leather over time.
 Dip a corner of a clean rag into the conditioning solution. Gently rub the solution into the leather using a circular motion. Allow the solution to dry onto the sofa overnight.


Be careful not to drench the rag in the solution or leave the sofa too wet. The liquid could damage the leather sofa.
 The next day, gently buff the leather to restore the shine. Begin at the top of the sofa and work your way down, buffing the leather in a small, circular motion.


Repeat the conditioning every six to twelve months to keep the leather soft and shiny.

 Rather, it is a technique or skill that can be learned by anyone, and is one of the oldest memory techniques in the world. One ancient technique is called a "Memory Palace". The idea is that you build a giant palace in your mind, with a special place for everything, and when you want to save a memory for later recall, you visualize yourself in the palace, putting the memory in the appropriate room. Then all you have to do later, is remember where you put it, go get it and see it with the mind's eye.
 Sort it by idea.
 For instance, if memorizing the Gettysburg Address, the first section ("Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.") refers to time, place and cause, so you could remember "section number 1 = when, where and why.
 Use the colors of the rainbow in the standard order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet, or ROY G BIV for short.
 So the words, letters and punctuation as shapes, as well as words letters and punctuation. Now try to remember the spacial relationship between words. Remember that the word "baseball" is to the left of the word "commissioner".
 Think of this as a bigger version of step 4. This way, when reciting the Gettysburg Address, you can remember that the first section ends "the proposition that all men are created equal" and that is connected to the first part of the next section, that goes "Now we are engaged in a great civil war."

, See the sections broken out, see their numbers and colors. See what words are next to each other. Even try to see the font it is printed in. The idea being, if you can really see the text in your mind's eye, you can actually read it off of the page in your head.

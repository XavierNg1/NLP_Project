 Make sure it is the kind that holds pencil shavings and you can open and close.
 Fold it up as small as you can and put it inside the pencil sharpener. (make sure the sharpener has no pencil shavings in it first)! It helps to use a post-it, as a full size piece of paper may not fit.
 If your friend sits really close to the teacher, they may want to actually break their pencil to avoid suspicion. If your teacher asks what you're doing, tell them that you're letting your friend borrow your pencil sharpener.
, You can simply hand your friend the sharpener out in the open. However, if you do this ten times in a row and your teacher sees, he/she will probably become suspicious. So, after a few times you might want to start making it less obvious.

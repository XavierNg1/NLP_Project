 While you may worry that applying pressure could make the milk come out faster, strategically applying pressure over your nipples when you feel your breasts engorging can help prevent the leaking from happening.Crossing your arms over your chest should allow you to apply the correct amount of pressure.
Plan to express your milk soon after it comes in. Applying pressure is a temporary solution.;
, While you’re breastfeeding, carry a cardigan, jacket, or other layering piece with you so that you can easily hide any spontaneous leaks.If you are going to work, plan your outfit to include your layering piece.
 You may not always be able to prevent leakage, so keep an extra top with you in case of emergencies.Most people won’t notice you’ve changed your clothes.


If you have an extra bra, keep that in your bag as well because your bra will also be soaked.
 While a nursing pad would be the best option, any material that soaks up the extra milk will be helpful in coping with the unexpected leak. Place a nursing pad, cloth, or even folded up napkins into your bra to soak up the milk. Change it out frequently to avoid having it soak through your clothes.
 If leaking is a consistent problem for you, you may find that a plastic milk collection cup, such as a Milkies Milk-Saver, is a great choice for you. These cups collect the milk as it leaks, so you are both protected from leak stains and are able to use the leaked milk.

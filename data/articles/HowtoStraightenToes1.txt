 If you've noticed that one or more of your toes are crooked, especially if pain or inflammation is involved, then make an appointment to see your doctor. Your family doctor is well-trained to be able to rule out anything serious (such as a fracture or infection), but remember your family doctor is not joint or foot specialist, so you may need to see a more specialized health professional to get the correct diagnosis.


Your doctor may decide to take an X-ray of your foot to get a better idea of the problem.
Your doctor may take blood from you and check your glucose levels because foot problems are common for people with diabetes.;
, Orthopods are joint specialists who correct joint problems via braces, splints, surgery or other invasive methods. You likely won't require surgery for your crooked toe, but your orthopod can correctly diagnose joint problems, evaluate whether arthritis is a factor and prescribe anti-inflammatories or analgesics (painkillers) if needed.


Your orthopedist may also want to take an X-ray, bone scan, MRI or diagnostic ultrasound to ascertain and properly diagnose your foot condition.
 A doctor who specializes in foot problems is called a podiatrist. Podiatrists can perform minor surgeries of the foot, but they usually focus more on foot/arch supports for your shoes (called orthotics), braces and custom made shoes.


A podiatrist is a great source of information on the most appropriate shoes for your feet.
Physical therapists, chiropractors and naturopaths may also be good sources of information regarding foot/toe conditions and offer natural, non-invasive treatments.

 Turn the oven on to 425 degrees F (220 C). Get out a baking sheet and line it with a sheet of parchment paper. This will prevent the potato wedges from sticking, but will also help them crisp up as they bake. Set the sheet aside., Scrub 2 large Russet (baking) potatoes and cut each one into wedges lengthwise. You should be able to get 10 to 12 long wedges from each potato. Put the potatoes in a large bowl filled with ice water. Soak the potatoes in the ice water for 30 minutes.Soaking the potato wedges in ice water removes excess starch, so the potatoes crisp up more when you bake them.
 Drain the water from the potatoes and pat the wedges dry with a paper towel. Put the potatoes in a bowl along with Greek seasonings and toss them, so they're coated. You'll need:1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
Salt and pepper, to taste
Juice of 1/2 lemon
2 tablespoons olive oil

, Transfer the seasoned wedges to the prepared baking sheet and arrange them, so they're not overlapping. Put the sheet in the oven and bake the wedges for 15 minutes. Remove the pan and flip the wedges over. Return the pan to the oven and bake the wedges for another 10 to 15 minutes.The potatoes should become tender in the center and crispy along the edges.
 Remove the wedges from the oven and drizzle them with creamy tzatziki. You can also scatter crumbled feta, chopped red onion, and chopped fresh parsley over the wedges. Squeeze a little lemon juice over the wedges just before you serve them.If you'd like to let your guests personalize their potato wedges, just set the garnishes out in prep bowls instead of scattering.

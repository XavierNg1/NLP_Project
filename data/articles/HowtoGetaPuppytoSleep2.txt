 Often owners accidentally train their puppy to wake and seek attention during the night because of how they respond when the puppy wakes. If the pup cries during the night, don't respond straight away — this will reward the behavior and teach them that whining is how they get attention. Instead, if you feel the puppy needs to be checked, wait for a lull between cries and then respond, so the silence is rewarded rather than the crying.
 Placing your puppy’s crate in your room will help them settle and sleep at night. Your presence in the room will comfort them during the night as opposed to an empty, unfamiliar room.Placing their crate in your room will also help you monitor them in case they need to go to the bathroom during the night.
 If your puppy still won’t sleep, or you choose to place the crate in another room, give them an article of your clothing. Your puppy will be comforted by your scent, and thus, will be more likely to sleep undisturbed through the night.Additionally, placing a radio or a ticking clock wrapped in a cloth in their crate or bed will soothe your puppy and help them sleep. Play soft music on a low setting to encourage them to fall asleep.
 Your puppy’s crate or bed should be appealing, and your puppy should associate their bed with positivity. In other words, their bed should be comfortable and warm. Place blankets and soft toys in their bed to ensure that they are warm and comfortable throughout the night.Consider the temperature and time of year when deciding how many blankets to give to your puppy. For example, your puppy might get hot if you give them too many blankets during the summer.
Never use bedtime as punishment. If you do, your puppy might develop an anxiety toward bedtime, and thus, they will be more reluctant to sleep.

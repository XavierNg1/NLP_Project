 If you have cuts or scratches on your arms or legs, long-sleeved shirts or pants are an easy way to hide them without looking too obvious. Women may consider wearing thick tights under skirts. During the summer months, consider lightweight garments and cover-ups such as lace tops, "burnout" fabrics, maxi skirts, capri pants, or surfer shorts.Wear a clean bandage under your clothes to keep them from rubbing and irritating the cut.
 If you have a cut on your wrist area, a chunky bangle or watch will help hide it. Wear a bandage under the jewelry to keep the cut from getting irritated.
 If you have shallow scratches or cuts on your arms or legs, such as those made by a cat, you can use makeup to cover them up. Select one that has yellow and pink undertones for the best match.You can use a liner brush and concealer that’s a little darker than your skin tone to dab the makeup over the area.
Don’t use makeup on a fresh wound or a deep cut, as this can cause infection.
 Purchase bandages in fun prints or patterns to "hide" your cut in plain view. A favorite cartoon character or print might help boost your mood, as well.

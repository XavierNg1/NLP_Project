 Look over the dress for any stains, taking into account what the stain consists of. Make sure you have the cleaning supplies you will need.


Take a good look at the hemline. Unless you lifted your skirt and carried your train everywhere you went on your wedding day, your train will be dirty. Wedding dress trains are like great big dry mops that clean the floors of churches and reception centers!
Inspect the different layers. Wedding dresses can consist of more than one layer of fabric, so it's a good idea to look over each layer for any stains. Inspecting every element of your dress will help you recognize what needs to be cleaned so you can plan accordingly.;
, Use a heavy stain remover (e.g. Stain RX) as soon as possible, but before you use it on your wedding gown, be sure to test it on a small area to ensure it doesn't ruin the fabric. Pick out a spot that is the least noticeable and test it on that area., While cleaning a stain on one layer, place a piece of paper towel underneath so the stain doesn't transfer to that layer. The paper towel should absorb the stain so it doesn't transfer onto another part of your dress., Don't rub the stain remover into the dress because your dress is fragile and may tear. Instead, apply the stain remover then use a wet towel to gently push away from the stain. Apply this method to the edges of the stain., Use a hair dryer to dry the water off the dress. Leaving it to air dry may create water rings in the dress.

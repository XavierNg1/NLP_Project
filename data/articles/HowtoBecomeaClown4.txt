 Focus on skills that people typically want from clowns. Getting really good at these skills will allow you to give your customers what they want. Here are some typical clown “acts” that people love to see:


Balloon animals
Small pranks (such as squirting water from a flower)
Basic magic (pulling a rabbit out of a hat)
Slapstick humor
Juggling
Small acrobatics, Create business cards with your contact information, clown name, and photo.Write down your specialties, such as birthday parties, magic tricks, or slapstick humor. Make flyers with this information on them and hang them up in public places (such as coffee shops, restaurants, and toy stores).
 Offer to do a friend’s child’s birthday party free of charge. Many clowns succeed because of word of mouth. If you offer to do one birthday party for free, you might get three more offers from parents at the party.


You can also set yourself up on a street corner to perform for tips. Put business cards out for people to take. Make sure that it is legal in your area to perform on the street. Sometimes clowning on the street for tips is a great way to meet new people and practice your performance., Freelance work is all about growing a network. Ask friends, family, coworkers, and neighbors to help you get more clients and gigs. Make sure that you give them multiple business cards of yours so that they can hand them out to others.
 As you become a more experienced and sought-after clown, you can definitely increase your rate. In the beginning, though, choose a rate that covers all the costs of your performance (such as balloons and transportation) plus a small amount that will increase as you become more experienced. Initially, charge about $100 per hour. More experienced or sought-after clowns can push as much as $500 per hour.

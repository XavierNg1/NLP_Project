 You can double-click the documentâ€™s name to open it in Word. Alternatively, open Word first, click the File menu, click Open, then double-click the document.
 To do this, click-and-hold the mouse button just before the first word on the page, then drag the cursor to the end of the final word. When you release the mouse button, all of the text on the page will be highlighted., This moves the highlighted text to that page.

Repeat this process for other pages in the document.

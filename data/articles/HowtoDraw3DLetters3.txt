 Don’t worry if it’s a bit messy as you will ink it later on. Don’t forget to add boldness to each letter as you need it to convey shadows.
 The trick is to copy the contours of the text/ letters and there you have it, depth!

,, The top part should be a lighter color while the depth should be darker.

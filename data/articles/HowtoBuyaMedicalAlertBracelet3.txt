 USB and QR alert tags work differently than normal IDs. Instead of engraved information, they encode your medical records. USB tags have a built in USB stick with your information, while QR Code tags are scannable with a smartphone. It may be advantageous for you to have one of these models.


Because of the memory space, USB and QR Code tags carry a lot more information for paramedics than a regular ID tag. This includes your condition, your medical history, your meds, and your contact information.
QR Code tags keep information online. This makes their storage space virtually unlimited.
Ease of access is another advantage. Medical professionals can get to your records almost instantly. With a normal tag, even one with a service package, they might have to call a phone number or your physician.
On the other hand, privacy may be an issue for some of these devices. The ease of access, while an advantage in an emergency, could make it easier for someone to access your personal data if you lose the ID.
 You might think that a USB or QR Code tag will be more expensive, because of the technology involved. This is not always so. Most are made from plastic and are quite reasonably priced. However, for QR Code tags you may have to sign up for a subscription service with your purchase.


Most models will cost between $10 and $50. They come in both bracelets and necklaces, but also keyrings and wallet cards. Many models also come with warranties against theft and accidental damage.
Like normal IDs, you can find a variety of styles, colors, and materials. Even some QR Code tags are made from steel.
The “My ID Dogtag Necklace” is a QR Code tag, for example. It costs $35 and comes with a one-year subscription to a premium service that costs $25 per year. If you choose not to renew, you go to a free but limited plan., Once you choose and order a model, you will need to input your medical records directly into the device or into a storage space. Do not forget to do this! Otherwise, your ID tag will be useless.


For USB tags, upload your information, medical documents, and contacts yourself. Models usually come with preloaded software. Just insert the USB drive into a computer and let the software run.Follow the USB software’s directions and input all the necessary data.
For a QR Code tag, you will probably get instructions with the ID about how to enter your information. Normally this is done online. The ID service will set up a password and profile for you, which you can access to input your information.

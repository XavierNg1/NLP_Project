 Make sure to buy fresh, ripe avocados from your supermarket. The flesh should indent a little when you press the skin. Insert a sharp knife near the tip of an avocado and push until you hit the pit. Slice around the pit to separate the avocado into halves. Remove the pit and scoop the flesh onto a cutting board. Slice the avocado meat into small chunks.


Try to keep the avocado meat intact when you scoop it out, so you'll be able to slice it into even chunks.
This recipe is easier to make with avocados that are very slightly underripe, since the avocado pieces will hold their shape instead of getting smashed in the dip.
 After peeling and chopping the mango and tomatoes, place them in a bowl with the avocado. Use a spoon to toss the ingredients together to mix them.
 Squeeze the lime juice over the mixture and sprinkle the chopped green onions and salt on top. Use a spoon to toss the mixture so the avocado, mango and tomatoes get fully coated with lime juice and seasonings.Do not over mix the dip, since the avocado will begin to break down and get smashed if you handle it too much.
For a spicier dip, try adding 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper and 1/2 teaspoon cumin.
 Mango avocado dip is also delicious with seafood dishes, such as fish tacos. Store leftover dip covered in the refrigerator for up to three days.

 To prepare your face for the clay mask, wash it with warm water and pat it dry.

Be sure the water is warm, not hot.;
, With your fingertips or a fan brush, apply a thin layer of the clay mask on your face in sweeping motions. Avoid your eyes and mouth. Clay masks will pull out the dirt and oil in your pores.Clay masks are best for people with oily, non-sensitive skin. They may be too intense for sensitive skin types.
 Don't let the mask dry completely. It should start to change colors (look lighter) but still feel tacky to the touch. If you let it dry completely, it pulls the moisture out of your skin.If the clay mask comes off when you touch it, it's still too wet.
 Use water to soften the clay. Use a washcloth to scrub your face clean, being sure to remove all the mask., Lightly apply an oil-free moisturizer after you've dried your face off.


You can use clay masks up to 2-3 times per week, depending on how your skin responds.

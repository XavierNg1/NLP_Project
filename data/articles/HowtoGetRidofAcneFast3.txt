 There’s a reason aloe vera gel is applied to sunburns - it soothes and takes away pain while preventing infection. Do the same for your acne by dabbing on some fresh aloe vera from the plant (or from a bottle of the pure stuff). Leave it on as long as you can or overnight, and rinse off with cold water afterwards.
 If you’ve ever cleaned your home with baking soda, you know the wonders it can do in killing bacteria and brightening surfaces. Mix baking soda with enough water to form a paste, and dab it onto your acne. Leave it be until it has dried and begins to flake off, after 20-30 minutes. Rinse off with warm water (scrub gently to use the exfoliating powers of the powder as well).
 Clay is a natural way to dry out your skin, removing the excess oil that is the source of most acne. Make your own clay mask out of powdered cosmetic clay and water or purchase one from the store. You can leave it on your pimples only or cover your entire face. Allow it to dry completely (around 20-30 minutes) before rinsing off with warm water.
 The whitening toothpaste you use isn’t just great for your smile, but for your skin as well. The chemicals present will dry out your acne while the whitening agents will work to reduce redness. Dab a bit of (white, not clear gel) toothpaste onto any pimple and leave it overnight. Rinse off after a few hours or in the morning.
 For the same reason toothpaste works so great, so does Listerine. Grab a cotton ball and pour it on, dabbing it onto your acne. Leave it on for as long as you are able before washing off with warm water. Your skin should feel tight and smooth afterwards as well.
 Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory as well as a pain reliever. Use both of these to the benefit of your skin by turning an aspirin tablet into a face mask. Grind up 1-2 pills and add just a bit of water. Dab this mixture onto your pimples and leave it to dry. Rinse off after a few hours (or overnight) with warm water.

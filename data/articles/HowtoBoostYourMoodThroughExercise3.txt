 If you are not sold on a set exercise program, you can try adding physical activity to your daily routine. Adding even a little physical activity to your day can go a long way to improving your mood. Do this by walking or biking to work or school. You may also take the bus to work or school and get off a few stops early so you can walk the rest of the way.You may also try to get into the habit of biking to school or work on a daily basis. If you cannot bike every day you may try biking once or twice a week so you are doing some physical activity during the week.
If you have to drive to work, you can try parking further away and walking to the office. This will allow you to still get some exercise in at the start and end of your day.
 Doing work that requires physical movement, such as doing laundry, cleaning the house, or running papers up and down several floors in the office, can allow you to get a little workout in your day. Try to work on your feet, rather than sit down all the time.You may opt to do housework once a day to get a little physical activity or add tasks that force you to get up and move around at work.
Rather than opt for the elevator or the escalators at work or school, go for the stairs. Taking the stairs once or twice a day can allow you to add some physical activity to your day and get you moving.
 You can also add physical activity to your routine by doing quick, easy exercises throughout the day. Doing even a few exercises throughout the day can help to boost your mood and keep you feeling energized.For example, you may do sit ups every hour on the hour or push-ups every time you file paperwork. You may also try going for a jog around the office or around school once you have done a task.

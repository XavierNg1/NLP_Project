 Something as simple as an incorrect address is not likely to rise to the level of fraud. But if you notice an incorrect address, that never has been connected to you, together with accounts that you do not recognize, that could be an indication that someone has been trying to steal your credit identity., If you are concerned that you may be the victim of credit fraud, you only need to contact one of the three credit reporting companies, Experian, TransUnion or Equifax. That company will accept your report and will notify the other two companies.You can contact TransUnion at 800-680-7289.
You can contact Experian at 888-397-3742.
You can contact Equifax at 888-766-0008.
 Notify whichever company you choose to contact that you wish to place an “Initial Fraud Alert” on your account. This is a note that will be attached to your credit report. Any lending agencies or potential creditors who may be asked to lend you credit in the future will see that note and will be warned to verify your identification before extending credit. This is designed for your protection.An initial fraud alert does not have any effect on your credit score.
Creditors may not, by law, refuse to lend to you because you have reported an initial fraud alert.
There is no charge to you for placing a fraud alert on your account.
 The initial fraud alert stays in place for 90 days. During that time, if you see no other activity that leads you to believe anything fraudulent was occurring, then you may just let it drop. If you wish, you may renew the alert by calling one of the companies again and asking to renew it.

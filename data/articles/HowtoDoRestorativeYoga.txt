 To do restorative yoga, find a spot where you can relax and where there are few distractions. You can choose a place indoors or outdoors, but take care that you are in a safe place where you're unlikely to be interrupted.You'll probably want to close your eyes while you're in many of these poses, so find a place where you can do this without fear. For example, a public park might not be the best place to do restorative yoga if you feel you will not be able to fully relax there.;
, Restorative yoga should be an entirely supported and comfortable experience that allows you to relax fully. A number of props are necessary to ensure this, but you don't necessarily have to buy any fancy yoga props.If you already have yoga props such as a yoga mat and yoga blocks, you will find them beneficial when doing restorative yoga. You'll also want several large blankets or towels, as well as a few pillows.
If you don't have any yoga props, choose a thick blanket to lay on the floor and several pillows of varying degrees of firmness. Rolled blankets or towels also can be used.
Since most of these poses are timed, you'll want to have a timer nearby so that you will be alerted when the time is up. The timer should have a soothing tone when it alerts, not something shocking or jarring.
 Relaxing music can help you get into a calm, restorative state. Typically the music that works best is classical or instrumental music. You can also find meditation mixes through online music services for this purpose.You don't want anything too fast or complex. Choose slower music without lyrics.
 Begin your restorative yoga session by coming to a comfortable seat, supported by blankets and pillows as necessary. You may want to wrap a blanket around your shoulders and torso for additional warmth.Typically yogis will sit cross-legged, but if this position isn't comfortable for you, choose something else.
The most important part of how you sit is to make sure that your spine is straight and neutral so that you are sitting up straight without arching your spine. Your chest and heart should be directly over your pelvis.
 As you begin your restorative yoga practice, clear your mind and bring your focus to your breath as you breathe slowly and deeply. On each inhale, expand your belly and lift your chest. With each exhale, pull your navel towards your spine to squeeze the air out.If you're just starting out, breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Open your throat so as you exhale you're making a "ha" sound in the back of your throat. With practice, you'll be able to keep your throat open while your mouth is closed and make this sound as you exhale through your nose.
A deep meditation isn't necessary to connect with your breath, but you do need to take a few minutes to sit and connect your mind and body before you begin your restorative yoga practice.

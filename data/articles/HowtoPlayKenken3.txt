 If you've got a three box "15+" cage in a 6x6 grid, you can't use a 1 or 2. Ever. You simply couldn't add any other two numbers up with 1 or 2 to get top 15. If the cage isn't L-shaped, you can't even use a 3, since only 6+6+3 = 15 and you can't use two sixes in a row. This may seem like useless information, but it means that the row or column must have its 1, 2, or 3 further down. By knowing you can't use them in the cage, you also tell yourself that they must be used further down the line.
 Best shown in an example, imagine a row 6-box row. Since it must contain the numbers 1-6, each row will always add up to 21 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21). Now imagine a 4 box, 12+ cage in that row. You might not know which four numbers add up to 12, but you do know that the other two boxes must add up to 9, since the whole row must equal 21, and you know that part of it adds up to 12. This means your top box can suddenly contain only 2 pairs -- 3 & 6 or 4 & 5.


4 x 4 puzzle rows must add up to 10.
6 x 6 puzzle rows must add up to 21.
9 x 9 puzzle rows must add up to 45.
Talented puzzlers can do the same thing with multiplication, too. For example, each row of a 6x6 must multiply to 720. If you have a big product in one row, find out what you have left to eliminate numbers., The strategy above is great for single row problems, but any non-linear cages and you'll be lost. However, remember that each row of a 6x6 equals 21, meaning that any two rows must equal 42. Similarly, if the product of one row is 720, then the product of two rows must be 7202. If you've got some cages with big sums or products ("20+," "45x"), you can subtract or divide these out to make the rest of the rows easier to solve.
 For difficult Kenkens, erasing possibilities is just as important as finding the right numbers. The "X-wing" is when you have the same possible number (say, a 2) in two side-by-side boxes in two different places (see example below). You might not know which one goes where, but know that two of those four boxes contain a 2. If a two is in the left box on one row, then it must be on the right box of the other row (because you can only have one 2 in each row). However, X-winging is when you can eliminate all 2s from every other space in the two rows (shown by the "X"). A two must be in the top or bottom -- meaning it cannot be in the middle rows. You can therefore eliminate any twos in between:2 or 4 | 2 or 3
X | X
X | X
2 or 3 | 2 or 1

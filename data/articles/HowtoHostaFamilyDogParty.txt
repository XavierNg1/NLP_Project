,, If you wanna be creative or just don't have the money, then make the decorations yourself. If your dog is frightened by balloons, steamers, or noise makers, I would advise you to limit your decorations.
 One method for hosting a doggie party will only include the family members because of a short notice. If your dog is friends with a neighborhood cat or dog, ask the owner if they would like to come.
 You can NEVER host a good party without food. If you want to makeÂ  your OWN recipe, for your cake then think of your dog's favorite foods. Write them down. Then, for your pet's safety, search the ingredients online. If they are good for your pet, then throw them in a cake mix. If they are not forget the cake.
 Instead of a cake buy or make dog treats. Lay them out on a pretty plate as party favors.
 If you can't, then at least fix them a glass of water.
, Make sure to tell them it means a lot that they came.
 Talk to your guest/s and try to make connections.
 If someone didn't bring anything, don't make a big deal about it.

 Tempura batter is a thin, crispy Japanese-style batter that is traditionally used with bite-sized pieces of meat, seafood, and vegetables. Cut the food into similar-sized pieces so that it cooks evenly. These foods work well with tempura batter:Shrimp
Crab pieces
Cubed chicken, pork or steak
Broccoli florets
Slices of sweet potato

, This batter should come out very thin and runny. Mix the ingredients together and use a whisk to make sure there are no lumps.
 Pour a few inches of vegetable or peanut oil into a heavy-bottomed pot. Add a few tablespoons of sesame oil for flavor if desired. Heat the oil until it reaches 350°F (176°C).


Special tempura fryers are available for keeping the oil at a steady temperature throughout the frying process.
If you don't have a fry thermometer, test the oil by dropping a battered piece of food into the pot. If it turns golden brown, the oil is ready to fry.
 When cooking tempura, food pieces are normally skewered on wooden or metal skewers. Skewer a piece of food, then dip it into the batter to completely coat it. You may want to skewer more than one piece on the same skewer.
 Dip the skewer into the pot so that the food pieces are submerged in oil. Hold them there for several minutes, until they are golden brown on all sides.









Since meat will require a longer frying time than vegetables, fry the meat in a separate batch.
Small pieces of meat and vegetables should need no more than five minutes' cooking time. Cut into a piece to make sure it is done in the center before eating.

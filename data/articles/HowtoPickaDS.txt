 Go to Nintendo's website and they will have a chart comparing all of the systems (click on "features" then "compare systems"). The amount you can spend on a gaming system will really effect which console you can buy.;
, If you would like to buy local, go to your local GameStop and they may have a refurbished system. Beware: If you do buy a used system from one of these sites, it may not be in perfect condition. It might have scratches or other damage. Make sure to read the description before you buy.
 Or even buy online if you want to.
 This will save you money and maybe even effort trying to find a case and your first game for the system so that when you get it you will have something to play.

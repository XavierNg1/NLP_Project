 You can do this with most variations of a Canadian map. Make sure you can spell their names correctly

, Their names are British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and Newfoundland. You may find the acronym BASMOQN ('bas-mok-win') useful. Try creating a mnemonic such as 'Bill and Sally Made One Quart of Nothing', 'Bart A. Simpson Marred Our Quiet Night', or 'Buy Albert's Scary Men on Quilts Now.' Be as creative as you can!

, They are Yukon Territory, Northwest Territory, and Nunavut. The acronyms are YNN ("yin"), "Why an N?" (sounds like "Y-N-N"), and You're Not Naked.
 They are Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Just visualize them as a triangle; Prince Edward Island on top, Nova Scotia in the right corner and New Brunswick in the left corner. Some acronyms are PEI-NB-NS ("pay-noo-bens") and Please Excuse It, Nobody Brought NeverSoft. (PEI,NBNS).

 The simplest corkscrews are “t” shaped, just a spiral metal “worm” with a handle attached at the top. Travel corkscrews, however have two parts: a worm with a plastic handle, capped by a sheath that narrows at one end. The sheath will pull away or unscrew to reveal the worm.The handles of some simple corkscrews will fold down against the worm. If yours is like this, just raise them upwards until the tool resembles a “t” shape.
 The plastic handle at the top of the worm should have a hole it it that is about the diameter of the handle. Slide the narrow end of the sheath into this hole, stopping when it no longer slides easily. The corkscrew should now be a “t” shape., Position the sharp tip of the worm just outside the center of the cork and gently twist it clockwise. Keep screwing it in until only the last turn of the worm sticks out of the cork., Grasp the “t” shaped handle, and slowly pull upwards to remove the cork. Gently pull, twist, and rock the cork from side to side until it comes all the way out. Then start pouring!Take your free hand and hold the bottle at the neck as you pull the cork out.
Unscrew the cork from the worm after removing it.
Remove the sheath from the hole and place it back over the worm when you are done if you are using a travel corkscrew.

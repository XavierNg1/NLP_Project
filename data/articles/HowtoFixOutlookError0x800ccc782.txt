 You can find it under tools. It may also be labeled as "Email Account Settings." This fix is specifically for times when you get the 0x800ccc78 error trying to send an email., You can also click "Change Email Account" in some versions. Basically, you'll need to manually reconfigure some of your outgoing mail settings. You need rework servers for the email address connected to Outlook.
 If you've only got one email account hooked up to outlook, just click on this one. This will bring you to a detailed menu allowing you to adjust the ports. Make sure that the box "My Outgoing Server Requires Authentication" (the box you checked in the previous method) is still checked.
 If the right box is still checked, move on to the Advanced section. However, be careful with this page. It has a lot of crucial information installed. The only thing you'll be editing is the port number.
 As long as this is the only thing you change, this should potentially solve the problem. Hit OK and Finish to get out of all the menus (not cancel, or the "X") and check to see if it worked. If not, there is one last solution to try out.

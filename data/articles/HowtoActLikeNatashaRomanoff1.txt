 Natasha is generally a very confident, easygoing, firm woman, with the ability of dry wit and humour. You don't exactly have to radiate charm, but try loosening up a little and being more confident - although not to the point where you're offensive to anybody. She is also a bouncy, sprightly woman, and very mature, so attempt to work these things into your manner. Don't go over the top - try to be subtle and mysterious!;
, Natasha is a trained spy and assassin, capable of any task given to her. This doesn't mean you have to attempt to spy on your next-door-neighbour as they hang out their washing, but it is always a good idea to be on top of everything that is happening in the world and in your personal life, such as school or family.Â A good activity to do is people-watching - go to your nearest coffee shop or mall, and watch the activity.
 Natasha's comic-book version is a more closeted, colder version of her, whilst her movie counterpart is more sassy and outgoing. You can follow one or you can combine the two.

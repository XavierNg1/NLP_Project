 Pascal walks around by the beach at a random time,a little less than once a week or even once a week or once a month.


Buy a red turnip from Joan.(Plant the turnip and be careful...the plant could die easily). After a week, the red turnip will be nice and big.;

Wendell should give you the Turban or Country Guitar. If you get the Turban, take it to Sahara when she comes to town. If he gives you a guitar, then give it to K.K. Slider.
Sahara should give you either the Massage Chair or Red Vase. If you get the Massage Chair, let Tortimer have it the next holiday and he should give you the scallop. Then just wait for Pascal to show up and give him the scallop.
If you got the Country Guitar, give it to K.K. Slider to get K.K.'s Picture
If you got the Red Vase, give it to Crazy Redd in exchange for the Safe. Give the safe to Tom Nook for the Tom Nook Picture.
The animals will ask for the guitar, vase, safe, or any other item only if it is in your pockets.

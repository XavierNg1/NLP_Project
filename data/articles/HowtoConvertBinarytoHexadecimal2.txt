 Binary numbers can only be 1 and 0. Hexadecimal numbers can be 0-9, or A-F, since hexadecimal is base-16. You can convert any binary string to hexadecimal (1, 01, 101101, etc.), but you need four numbers to make the conversion (0101→5; 1100→C, etc.). For this lesson, start with the example 1010.

1010

If you don't have 4 digits, add zeros to the front to make it four digits. So, 01 would become 0001., Each of the four numbers signifies a type of number decimal system number. The last digit is the one's place. You will make sense of the rest of the digits in the next step. For now, write a small one above the last digit.1010


10101{\displaystyle 1010^{1}}

Note that you are not raising anything to any power -- this is just a way to see what digit means what.
 These are the rest of your place holders. If you're curious, this is because each digit represents a different power of 2. The first is 23{\displaystyle 2^{3}}, the second 22{\displaystyle 2^{2}}, etc.

18041201{\displaystyle 1^{8}0^{4}1^{2}0^{1}}


, Luckily, this conversion is easy once you have four numbers and know what they all mean. If you have a one in the first number, you have one eight. If you have a zero in the second column, you have no fours. The third column tells you how many twos, and the second how many ones. So, for our example:1010


18041201{\displaystyle 1^{8}0^{4}1^{2}0^{1}}

 8 0 2 0


, Once you have your new hexadecimal numbers, simply add them up.

1010


18041201{\displaystyle 1^{8}0^{4}1^{2}0^{1}}

 8 0 2 0


8+0+2+0=10{\displaystyle 8+0+2+0=10}


Final answer: The binary number 1010 converts to A in the hexadecimal system.
 This is so you don't get confused when reading hexadecimal ("is that a 1 and a 5, or a 15?"). Luckily, the system is super easy, since you can't have a hexadecimal number bigger than 15. Simply start the alphabet with 10, so that:


10=A{\displaystyle 10=A}


11=B{\displaystyle 11=B}


12=C{\displaystyle 12=C}


13=D{\displaystyle 13=D}


14=E{\displaystyle 14=E}


15=F{\displaystyle 15=F}

 As with concrete, your first task is to locate the source of the smell. If your dog has just gone to the bathroom, the carpeting will be wet. If it is an old stain, however, look for patches of carpet that are discolored or somewhat stiff to your touch.
 Use paper towels, a wadded up newspaper, or fabric towels to blot the area where your dog has peed in order to clean up as much liquid as possible. To do so, apply as much pressure as possible to the wet area (you may try walking or standing on top of the towels). Switch out your towels as they become wet, continuing this blotting process until the towels remain dry.


If possible, pull back the carpet in the urine-soaked area and place towels both underneath and on top of the carpet. This will help get the moisture out from under the carpet, allowing you to remove as much of the smell as possible., Once you have removed as much urine as possible, soak the spot with either your store-bought enzymatic cleaner or your homemade solution. Ensure you cover the entire area to get any remaining uric acid.It is a good idea to do a spot test before applying any solution to your carpeting. This will allow you to make sure the cleaning solution won’t harm or discolor your carpeting.
 Blot the area with towels again to clean up the solution. Once you have removed most of the solution, allow the spot to air dry., Once the area has dried, sprinkle baking soda over it, covering it completely., Mix ¾ cup of 3% hydrogen peroxide with 1 teaspoon of liquid dish or laundry detergent. Apply this solution directly over the baking soda., Use a soft brush to scrub the area, ensuring you work the solution down into the carpet., Allow the area to dry after scrubbing and then vacuum over the area, picking up any dirt, debris, and dust from the affected area.

 You should obviously go for the gun you are best with. However some guns are obviously over-powered, so use your best judgement on which gun to use.
 Turn off all tactical and lethal. Also, put it on a map mentioned above and adjust the time limit to infinite, and the score cap to you and your opponent's liking

, The jump shot is the act of jumping while in a gunfight in the hopes that it will make you a harder target to hit. Dropshotting is where you quickly go to prone in a gunfight, to again, make you a harder to target to hit. Don't forget to adjust your aim when doing this.
 This has a lot to do with experience, knowing common places people like to go and shooting before you actually see the person guarantees you the kill if you are right about where they are.
 Contrary to what the name would suggest, this is not a glitch, but a mere tactic in which you can see your enemy, but he can only see the top of your head. This is good against amateur players, but if your opponent is a veteran, this will make it easier to kill since your head is easily shot at.

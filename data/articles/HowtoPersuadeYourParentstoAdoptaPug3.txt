 Use that to improve the odds.
 Stop any slacking and start working harder in school. Good grades make parents want to reward you, and you're more responsible.
 Chores are hard work, but with a clean room comes a clean slate. Your parents may let you pick a Pug if you're ready for one!


If you have fish, geckos or other lizards, a rabbit or rodent or even a pet bird, take care of it! Proper care of your current pet may tell your parents 'I want another pet, and I'm ready'.
 If you need money for a Pug you better be ready to buy its food, toys, etc. so be prepared.
 This should be a while after you've accumulated some cash and shown them actions speak louder than words.

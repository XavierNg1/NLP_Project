 If you believe that food is triggering bipolar mood swings for you, you should start keeping a food journal. This food journal should detail everything you eat, drink, or consume throughout the day. Include everything, no matter how small. Anything might be a food trigger for you.Be as detailed as you can about your food, including brand, type, or quantity of food. A brand may trigger you based on ingredients while the same food made by another brand may not trigger you because it doesnâ€™t use an ingredient.
Make sure you add everything that you eat. If you drink coffee or tea with milk and sweetener, add those to the journal. List soda, juice, or any other beverages.;
, At the same time you start your food diary, you should start a mood diary. This mood diary should track your mood and physical symptoms related to your bipolar. Note the time that the symptoms occur and be as specific as you can with the symptoms.For example, if you feel yourself spiralling around 2 p.m., log that. If you feel depressed and start crying every day at 4:30, log that.
 After you have been keeping your food journal and mood diary for awhile, start comparing them. Look for patterns between the foods you eat and the symptoms. Notice if you have recurring symptoms, and look to see if there are foods you eat right before them.For example, you may feel depressed or have a mood swing 30 minutes after you eat dairy products, or you may feel foggy if you ingest artificial sweeteners.

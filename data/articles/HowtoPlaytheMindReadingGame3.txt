 Also, avoid picking the super shy person hiding out near the back. Select someone who falls somewhere in between those extremes. This person is engaged and paying attention, but not jumping up and down with excitement.


The people who are overly eager to participate are usually just seeking attention for themselves. You don’t want to perform with someone who is trying to upstage you.
The very shy people don’t want to be involved and are generally not very enjoyable to perform with.
 Body language is nonverbal communication transmitted through movement. Certain movements can give you helpful clues about a person’s current mental state. This is very helpful when you're performing. For example, if someone is fidgeting with their hands, shaking their leg or tapping their toes, this usually indicates anxiety, irritation or boredom.Being able to read body language is a useful skill to have when you're playing other kinds of games, too. For example, card games.
Good posture and standing up straight communicates confidence and alertness; slouching indicates shyness, sadness or a lack of confidence.
Pay attention to your own body language as well. Stand up straight and look the person directly in the eye. Avoid fidgeting.
 When the muscles around the mouth are pulled back, the eyebrows are lifted and/or the forehead is wrinkled, this usually means the person is afraid, nervous or lying about something. When you’re performing, remember these tips for yourself, as well.Control your facial muscles as much as you can so that you won’t give anything away.
This skill is also very useful for card games.
Avoid making any extra facial movements, such as eye rolling, that can communicate negativity and judgement.

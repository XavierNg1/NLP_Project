 Add a quarter teaspoon of your usual dish washing detergent.
 Place the processor lid on and set aside.
 During this time, the vinegar will absorb the pepper odor from the plastic.
 Wash the processor as usual. Give it the sniff test; if it's odorless, you're good to go. If not, repeat but allow the soaking to occur for 8 to 12 hours, then rinse. That will be sufficient to remove the odor.

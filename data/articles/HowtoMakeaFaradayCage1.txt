 Wrap your device in plastic wrap, or place it in a plastic bag. This will put a barrier between the device and the conductive aluminum layer. It can also serve as a waterproof layer for extra protection.You can wrap the item in cloth to help prevent edges from poking holes in the plastic and/or aluminum layers, though this is not necessary.;
, The aluminum foil will act as the conducting layer. There should be no tears or gaps in the foil. Use your hands to mold the foil around the entire device. This will serve as the first of three layers of aluminum foil.The foil is referred to as a conductive layer. The metal allows radiation to travel along its surface, while the plastic insulating layers prevent it from traveling through to your device., You should cover every inch of the device in at least three layers of aluminum. Protection can be maximized by adding plastic layers in between each layer of aluminum foil. This will create alternating layers of conductive and nonconductive materials and shield your device from harmful electromagnetic radiation.A Faraday cage is designed to protect devices from an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) blast. This is a high intensity blast of radiation that comes from a weapon or a naturally powerful source (e.g. the sun).You can also use a Faraday cage to block a cell phone or radio from getting reception. In this case, you would need fewer layers since the radiation is much weaker than an EMP blast.
Adding adhesives like glue between each layer will make your faraday cage more sturdy and permanent, but it will be harder to remove.

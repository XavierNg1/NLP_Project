 One great thing about studying outside is that it feels more like a social experience than studying alone in your room. Bring a friend or study group with you, and you'll finish up feeling like you've had some social time even if you don't talk much.Just being out with other people can produce this feeling of social connection, even if you don't bring anyone with you.
 Research shows that changing locations can help you retain information better. This is easier to do outside than in your house, because there are usually a lot more locations to choose from!Scientists believe studying in multiple settings enriches the information with more contextual stimulation, and this in turn makes the brain less likely to forget it.
 As with studying inside, you'll focus better and get more out of studying outside if you take breaks. Since you're outside, make the most of these breaks by getting a little exercise.Take a short walk or throw a Frisbee around for a few minutes instead of logging on to social media. You'll feel invigorated by some exercise, and that can give you renewed focus when you return to your studies.

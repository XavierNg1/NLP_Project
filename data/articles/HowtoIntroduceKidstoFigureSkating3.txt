 If you want your child to be invested in a hobby, keep in mind it's a financial investment as well. You do not need to overspend on top notch equipment, especially if you can find solid skates secondhand. However, budget each month for things like lessons, new skates, and other expenses., Make sure your child is invested in figure skating for the right reasons. While participating in competitions can be fun, a child may stop enjoying the sport if there's an overemphasis on winning. Talk to your child about how they should figure skate for their own enjoyment.Tell your child winning does not make them successful. Say something like, "Have fun in the competition, but remember your goal is to improve yourself personally. I'll be proud of you even if you don't win."

, Figure skating comes with a lot of tests and competitions. Your child will sometimes not perform as well as they want. Encourage them to see setbacks as an opportunity to learn and grow.For example, say your child does not pass a figure skating test. Say something like, "This is a good thing. You know where you need to improve and you can do great next time."
Remind your child it's okay that they're not perfect. Say something like, "Even the best skaters have their bad days."

, Figure skating can get competitive. Never compare your child to another skater. If your child compares themselves to a peer, say something like, "Everyone goes at their own pace. There's nothing wrong with that."

 Place your shoe on top of the ice cubes, gum-side down. Avoid letting the ice cubes go inside or around the shoe, as this will make your shoe wet.
 To prevent it from melting too fast, use a food storage bag that can be zipped closed or tie the bag shut.
 You will only be able to remove the gum after it has frozen solid. This may take a little while -- so have patience!








, Carefully use a dull butter knife or putty knife to scrape the hard, frozen gum off the shoe. Move the knife slowly to avoid cutting the shoe or yourself.

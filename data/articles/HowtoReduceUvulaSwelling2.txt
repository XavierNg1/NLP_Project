 If you’re having a hard time swallowing, whether it’s food, liquid, or saliva, your uvula might be swollen. Try a few practice swallows to make sure you’re having a hard time and it wasn’t just a larger-than-normal piece of food or too-big drink of something.If you're having a hard time swallowing and breathing, contact your doctor immediately.
 If your uvula is swollen, you might find yourself choking or gagging even when there isn’t anything in your throat. Because your uvula hangs down in the back of your throat, any swelling in it can make you feel like you’re gagging., This is an especially important symptom to look out for in small kids, who might not be able to tell you how they’re feeling. If you notice that they are drooling more than usual, they might have a swollen uvula., A swollen uvula is usually caused by a bacterial infection, and those infections usually come with a fever. If you’re having a hard time swallowing and you’re choking or gagging, take your temperature to see if you have a fever. Normal temperatures vary from person to person, but anything more than a degree or two above 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (or 37 degrees celsius) is a fever.If you have a fever, see your doctor immediately. A fever can indicate something much more serious is wrong, and fevers - even slight ones - in children can be very dangerous.
 If you suspect you might have a swollen uvula, you’ll have to check it in the mirror. Stand in front of a mirror that’s high enough for you to see your whole face or hold a hand mirror up. Open your mouth as wide as you can and look at your uvula – the drop shaped piece of skin in the back of your throat. If it looks red or swollen, you should see a doctor.

 While most varieties of household soaps are a poor fit for automobiles, Ivory soap is designed to be especially gentle. It contains mild acids that will eat away at sun-baked splatters without harming the paint underneath.Ivory soap is available in liquid or bar form, and can be found at most major supermarkets or drug stores.
To treat your car’s finish with a solid bar of soap, rub the soap into damp cloth until it begins to bubble, then use the cloth to scrub the affected area.
 Mix a couple tablespoons of baking soda with water to form a paste. Spread the paste over small areas littered with dried insects and leave it to sit for 5-10 minutes. Once time is up, wipe away the baking soda paste with a microfiber towel, then rinse and dry.Baking soda is another item most people keep in their homes that can be used to safely and effectively lift stains on a vehicle’s exterior.
 Spray the spot very lightly with WD-40 and leave it to take effect for 1-2 minutes. You can then simply wipe away the insects using a clean cloth. This makes a handy solution for busting bug spots when you’re unable to give your car a proper wash or wax.Oils like WD-40 are formulated to cut through grease and other types of resilient residue, which makes it perfect for dealing with crusty gunk.
As an added bonus, WD-40 is useful for reducing the appearance of scratches in a car’s paint., If insects are piled on so thick that other methods fail to remove them, or they’ve had a long time to become cemented into place, you can use a very fine steel wool (#000 grade is optimal) to wear them down. This will require you to work slowly and cautiously, but with a steady hand it’s practically guaranteed to erase even the most maddening messes.Focus on a small area and use as little pressure as possible.
This is only recommended as a worst case scenario solution. If you’re not careful, you could easily leave scratches on your car.

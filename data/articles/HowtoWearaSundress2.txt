 For a scarf to work with a sundress, it should be made of a light fabric, like cotton or silk. (Do not, under any circumstances, pair a thick, woolen winter scarf with a sundress.)

, Unless you live in Alaska or someplace else where it snows in the summer, try to avoid wearing a bulky jacket over your sundress.
 Long or short necklaces and bangle bracelets look great with sundresses, and chandelier or feather earrings plus a ballerina bun is an especially good combination.
 Obviously they won't be of much assistance if it's cloudy outside, but on sunny days they can be a real asset (fashionably and for the health of your eyes).
 If you've got a multi-colored patterned sundress on, pick your favorite color out of the design and find a polish that matches. Brush on a couple of coats and you're good to go!

, Flip-flops, flats, and even ankle boots will work, but never wear running shoes or Uggs; they're just too clunky for the streamlined summer look you want to achieve.
 You don't want to look unseasonably dark, but you could put on some mascara and foundation if your skin's a little blotchy. Add eyeshadow and lip gloss too, but remember, nothing too dramatic.
 Loose curls, pulled back, fishtail braid, whatever you're in the mood for--it'll make your full outfit look that much better.
 You might get tired of your scarf or sunglasses later in the day, and if it's especially hot you'll want to have sunscreen, chapstick, water, etc.

 It looks like a cog.
, There's one main check-box to turn automatic updates on and off, and then further sub-settings, too.



Download newly available updates in the background: This means your computer will automatically do the updates even while you're working on other things.

Install app updates: This means the computer will automatically update the apps you've downloaded when new versions are available.

Install OS X updates: This means the computer will automatically update new versions of its own software.

Install system data files and security updates: This means the computer will handle any system data files and security updates automatically for you.
 If you leave certain ones unchecked, this doesn't mean you won't be able to get those updates; your computer will just ask you first, rather than doing them automatically.

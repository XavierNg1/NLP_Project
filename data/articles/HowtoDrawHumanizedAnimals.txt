 Try to work out quickly what makes them look more human than animal. Don't try too hard to guess the reasons - it's your initial, fast reactions that reveal the most telling features.


Some animals to check out include those created by Beatrix Potter, Brambly Hedge characters, Wind in the Willows characters and Disney animals.;
, This is probably the most obvious way to make the animal appear more human-like. It might be a whole outfit of clothing or just pieces of clothing, such as a top, pants or just jewellery.
 In general mammals and marsupials walk on all fours. Of course, there are exceptions such as the kangaroo and birds, fish, insects and the like have different ways of walking. However, take a basic four-legged animal and draw it walking on only its two back legs and it soon starts to look very humanized. Even fish can be drawn walking on their rear end and tail.
 As soon as an animal is carrying something other than food or nesting material, it begins to take on a human-like dimension. Think of an animal carrying a basket, a fishing rod, a sword or similar items and you'll start to see it as humanized.
 There are plenty of choices here but technology presents some of the greatest contrasts, such as a cat typing on a computer, a rat talking on the phone or a toad driving a vehicle. Or, the animal might play a sport (holding a golf club, tennis racket, hockey stick, etc.), play a board game, have a sword fight or cook a meal, etc.


Dancing animals are striking as a drawing subject.
 Comb-overs, buns, beehive dos, plaits and the like can all make the animal appear more human. And don't forget beards, mustaches and even baldness.
, The manner in which you draw the eyebrows, lips, nose, eyes, etc. can all say something about the emotional state of the animal. Of course, emotional states are a very human trait, so this can certainly humanize the animal.


Smiles are good. As are upturned or down-turned eyebrows.

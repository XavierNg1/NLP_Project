 10 gallons (37.9 L) is good for a few small crabs but for jumbo crabs you will need a 20 gallon (75.7 L) tank. 10 gallon (37.9 L) tanks are about $13 and 20 gallon tanks are about $31. Avoid buying starter kits at pet stores, because they don't hold humidity in.;
, You can get a hiding hut. You will need at least three natural shells for each crab. Don't forget to get a food shell and water dish and a sea sponge for the dish and a water mister. You will need some type of bedding such as coconut fiber or forest bedding. Of course you could just go with plain sand.
,

step 5 Make sure that there is always salt water in the tank,,, Hermits love to check out new shells, just for fun. And it may even accept the shell as its new one. Clean the shell well first; wash in hot water, then add to the tank. Choose one of a medium to large size.


If your crab won't accept the new shell, place the crab in an isolated container with the shell. It will accept it eventually.

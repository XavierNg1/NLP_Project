 If you don't have iTunes, first download it for free from the Apple website;
, If you don't have one, acquire another iPad to USB (or Lightning to USB) connector.
 Make sure you are looking at your iTunes Library and not the iTunes Store.


If you cannot find your device, try navigating to the View drop-down menu at the top of your screen and clicking "Hide Sidebar" to free up more space on the display. This option will not be available if the sidebar is already hidden.
If you are using an older version of iTunes, the device may appear in the left-hand pane instead. In this case make sure your sidebar is visible by navigating to "View: Show Sidebar".
, Alternatively, select "Choose Folder", navigate to the folder you store your photos in, and click Open.


If you don't want to sync with your entire collection, make a folder specifically for photos you want to have available on your iPad. You can use the "Selected Folders" option to only sync with certain albums or subfolders within the application or folder you selected.
 Keep your iPad connected while it syncs with the photo collection you selected. It should now "sync" every time you connect the two devices together, automatically deleting or adding photos to match changes on the synced computer.


If you'd like your iPad to sync every time the two devices are on the same WiFi network, stay in the device menu and select "Sync with this iPad over WiFi" under the Summary tab.

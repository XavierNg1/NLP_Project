 This is a bacterium that is known to kill cutworms, and it's widely available in garden supply stores. It's a natural way to get rid of cutworms without causing harm to plants or animals. Apply it to the soil in the affected area.


This bacterium harms other types of moths and butterflies, so if you don't want to hurt any other types of insects, use a different method.
Spray pesticides in the afternoon for best results against cutworms. Since they feed after dark, you want the pesticide to be freshly applied when they come to dinner. Reapply the pesticide after each rain until the plants are large enough to be safe from the worms.
 This is a natural powder made from ground up fossils that can be sprinkled around the affected area. It isn't harmful to humans, plants or animals, but it kills insects that walk over it by piercing them and causing them dehydrate. Be sure not to apply this to areas where you want to promote a healthy insect population.


Apply the powder around the base of any plants where you suspect cutworm activity. You can apply with a bulb applicator to avoid getting it in your eyes or inhaling it, as this may cause irritation.
Try ground up eggshells or coffee grounds as an alternative.
 Cutworms love to eat cornmeal, but it hurts their digestive system. Many will overeat it to the point of killing themselves. Sprinkle some in the affected area of your garden. Just don't overdo it, or you may draw other pests., If you mix molasses with sawdust and wheat bran, you'll create a thick paste that can be painted in circles around the plants in the area where cutworms hang out. When they crawl over the molasses mixture, it will get stuck to their bodies and prevent them from ruining your plants.

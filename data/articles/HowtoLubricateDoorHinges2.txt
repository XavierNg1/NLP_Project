 If you're struggling to remove the hinge pin from a sticky door, soak it in some penetrating lubricant spray for up to 12 hours before trying to remove it. WD-40 is another product commonly used for the purpose. Spray a liberal amount of penetrating spray onto the hinge and let it sit.


Many people starting forcing the pin out with a hammer, but if it is very rusted, this could damage the wood of the door, break the hinge, and leave you with a bigger repair job on your hands.
 After letting it soak, use the end of the screwdriver to tap the pin through the hinge, pushing it out gently. This can be a more effective way of getting the pin removed from the hinge to lubricate it.


Use something small enough to push the pin out. The tip of a pair of pliers, even an ink pen or another small thin tool might be appropriate for the job. Find something the approximate size of the hinge you're working on.
 Roll the pin on a flat surface to see if it is bent, and examine the pin for signs of wear. If it's very rusty and bent, it's good to spend a little bit of time straightening it out and cleaning it up before re-installing it, so you can avoid a squeaky door in the future.


If it's bent, straighten it out by putting it on a cement floor and tapping it with a hammer to bend it back into shape.
Use emery cloth to sand down the pin, removing the rust. This will help the pin fit more loosely, creating less resistance and less potential for squeaking.

 The formula is A=πr2{\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2}}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the circle, and r{\displaystyle r} equals the radius., Use algebra to get the radius r alone on one side of the equation:

Divide both sides by π{\displaystyle \pi }:A=πr2{\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2}}Aπ=r2{\displaystyle {\frac {A}{\pi }}=r^{2}}

Take the square root of both sides:Aπ=r{\displaystyle {\sqrt {\frac {A}{\pi }}}=r}r=Aπ{\displaystyle r={\sqrt {\frac {A}{\pi }}}}


, Use this formula to find the radius when the problem tells you the area of the circle. Substitute the area of the circle for the variable A{\displaystyle A}.

For example, if the area of the circle is 21 square centimeters, the formula will look like this: r=21π{\displaystyle r={\sqrt {\frac {21}{\pi }}}}.
 Begin solving the problem by simplifying the portion under the square root (Aπ){\displaystyle {\frac {A}{\pi }})}. Use a calculator with a π{\displaystyle \pi } key if possible. If you don't have a calculator, use 3.14 as an estimate for π{\displaystyle \pi }.

For example, if using 3.14 for π{\displaystyle \pi }, you would calculate:r=213.14{\displaystyle r={\sqrt {\frac {21}{3.14}}}}r=6.69{\displaystyle r={\sqrt {6.69}}}

If your calculator allows you to enter the whole formula on one line, that will give you a more accurate answer.
 You will likely need a calculator to do this, because the number will be a decimal. This value will give you the radius of the circle.

For example, r=6.69=2.59{\displaystyle r={\sqrt {6.69}}=2.59}. So, the radius of a circle with an area of 21 square centimeters is about 2.59 centimeters.

Areas always use square units (like square centimeters), but the radius always uses units of length (like centimeters). If you keep track of units in this problem, you'll notice that cm2=cm{\displaystyle {\sqrt {cm^{2}}}=cm}.

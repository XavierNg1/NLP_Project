 Switch your massaging hand so that your hand is wrapped over the top with your fingers facing down. Your thumb should still be laying on your palm. Now, you can work on the pressure point area of your palm, between your thumb and index finger, which is a very sensitive area.
 There is a muscle here that holds most of the tension in the hand. Here, you will do some deep compressions, kneading, or gliding. You can do this by either pinching with the thumb and index finger or using your knuckles., Use your thumb and index finger to make small, circular motions that will facilitate tension release. Hold pressure as long as it feels comfortable. It should result in a dull ache that is not unpleasant, but may take some getting used to over time.








Keep a firm hold and tug at the skin gently until the fleshy web snaps away from your grasp. Repeat this process on the skin between all of your fingers., If you find that most of your hand pain stems from the thumb, you can continue this work down your forearm on the side the thumb is on. One of the thumb muscles connects near the elbow, so it's important not to overlook this as a potential cause of pain., After you are finished with your very relaxing hand massage open and close your hand and wiggle your fingers. You can now repeat this massage on your opposite hand.

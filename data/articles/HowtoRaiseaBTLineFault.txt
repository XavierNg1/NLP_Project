 If it is then there is no problem.;
, If it is flashing, this means Broadband is not fully active down the line (fault). If it is not switched on (no light) there is no Broadband signal active down the line (fault).


If the light is on solid all the time, switch the router (Broadband box "Homehub", "Voyager") off so there are no lights on. Then switch it back on. Switch the computer off then on again (restart), then check the internet.
 This is the BT Free technical advice help desk (majority off shore from UK). This may take some time to do some tests on the line and to do some internal tests within your home (done by you). This involves you taking the faceplate off the Master socket (where the land line is accessed), this requires you to have a screwdriver. Behind that is a socket which the ADSL filter plugs into. This will have the router connected to the filter. Switch the router on and see it the "Broadband" or "DSL" light is on. if this is still flashing or not on, this is definitely a fault. Tell the Tech help desk to book it as a fault due to you doing this test within your home.
 This is an advanced technical help desk but costs Â£9.99 per month with a minimum term contract of 3 months. Call Tech help and ask for the number.

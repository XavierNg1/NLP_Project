 Start by washing your hands for 20 seconds with soap under running water. Rinse your hands and dry them off with a paper towel. Turn off the faucet using a paper towel., Unscrew the top of the nebulizer cup and put the prescribed medication into the nebulizer. Many types of respiratory medications for nebulizer treatments come in pre-measured doses. If yours is not pre-measured, measure out the exact amount prescribed for one dose. Secure the top tightly to prevent the medication from spilling out. Don't forget to plug the air compressor into an electrical outlet if it is not battery operated.


Medications that can be put in the nebulizer include inhaled beta agonist and anticholinergics, inhaled glucocorticoids, and inhaled antibiotics. Other inhaled medications are available for the treatment of non-respiratory diseases. Not all drugs can be aerosolized.
The jet, or pneumatic, nebulizer is the most common type. Newer nebulizers are designed to deliver the entire mediation during inhalation. Nebulizer performance can be affected by nebulizer method, mechanism of aerosol formation, and drug formation. If you need instructions about how to use your nebulizer, talk to your doctor or respiratory therapist.
 Secure it to the nebulizer cup. Although different manufactures may have slightly different jet nebulizers, most mouthpieces will attach to the top of the nebulizer cup. Most nebulizers have mouth pieces instead of face masks, since masks can lead to facial deposits.
 Attach one end of the oxygen tubing to the nebulizer cup. On most types of nebulizers, the tubing will connect on the bottom of the cup. Connect the other end of the tubing to an air compressor used for nebulizers.

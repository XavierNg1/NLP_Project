 If you want your car to be colored, place the paper colored-side-down. If you want your car to be white, place the paper white-side-down.;
, Fold the paper in half, widthwise. Run your fingernail along the fold to make a crease, then unfold the paper. Make sure that the white side is still showing.If you are making a white car, then the colored part should be showing.
 Fold the top edge of the paper down by one-third. Next, fold the bottom edge of the paper up by one-third. This will be known as your top and bottom flaps. You should now have three, equal-sized sections on your paper., Go back to your top flap. Fold the right corner upwards until it goes past the top, folded edge. The left point of the corner should be about one-third of the way across the flap., Fold the left corner on the top flap upwards. Next, fold the two corners of the bottom flap down. Each folded corner should be one-third the length of your flaps.
 These corners will eventually become wheels. You can make them look more wheel-like by flattening the points. Fold the upper tips down and the lower tips up., You now have the body of the car., This is known as a pocket fold.To do this, hold the car gently in your left hand. Press down on the right side of the crease until it goes into the car. Flatten the car, and run your fingernail along the edge to make a crease.


Make the pocket fold at a deep angle, so that it matches up with the back wheel.
 Use the same technique as you did to make the windshield. This time, make the pocket fold at a slight angle so that it extends past the front wheel., Thanks to the pocket folds, the car won't lay completely flat. You should be able to stand it up on all four wheels.


Take your car to the next level by drawing some windows, doors, handles, and other details.

 You can only divide numbers with exponents if they have the same base. If they don't have the same base, you'll have to manipulate them until they do if it's possible.








Ex: x8 รท x5


, Simply subtract the second exponent from the first. Don't worry about the base for now.









Ex: 8 - 5 = 3

, Now you can write the new exponent above the original base.









Ex: x8 รท x5 = x3

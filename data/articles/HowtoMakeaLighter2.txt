 Use a foam pencil grip that’s about an inch and a half long. You don’t need a particularly ergonomic pencil grip that will bend easily. It should be firm and straight. Form a small foil ball. It should be just large enough to cover the hole at one end of the grip and squeeze securely into the end of the hole.
 The pieces should be about as big as peas. Then, put a thin layer of Vaseline or other petroleum jelly between the pieces. As the petroleum jelly is heated to liquid, it’s fumes become combustible.
 Insert the cotton from the open end of the grip down toward the foil ball at the other end. Add cotton until the foam cylinder is full.
 Use your hands to straighten a paperclip and place it a quarter of the way down the pencil grip on the tin-foil-ball side. You’ll need to squeeze in the paperclip along the wall of the pencil grip, between the grip and the foil ball.
 Use small rubber bands about 3/4 in. or 7/8 in. long (sizes 37 or 8, respectively).Wrap one rubber band about a centimeter below the top and one rubber band about a centimeter below the bottom of the grip. This will secure in place the mechanism you have so far, and get you ready to wrap the grip with foil.
 Use a long strip of aluminum foil about the width of your thumb. Wrap the foil around the circumference of the pencil grip from top to bottom.
 Wrap rubber bands over the foil and around the pencil grip. Take two rubber bands, and wrap one around the top and the other around the bottom of the pencil grip. Leave about a centimeter of space from the rubber band and each end of the grip.
 Now you have your homemade lighter, and you’ll use the cotton balls as wicks to melt and light the petroleum jelly. Hold the lighter by the bottom of the straight paperclip. Use a match to light the other end at the inside top of the pencil grip.

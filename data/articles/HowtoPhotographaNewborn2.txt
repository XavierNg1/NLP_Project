 Look around your house for a well-lit spot, like by a north or south facing window. A slightly diffused natural light source, like a window covered by a shear curtain, is your best option. That way, your shot will be well-lit without exposing the newborn to direct sunlight.If your home doesnâ€™t have any good natural light sources, see if you can set up a photo shoot at the home of a friend or family member. If necessary, you can also push the ISO setting up to make your camera more light sensitive.While it won't cause any damage, a flash can startle a newborn, so it's best to go with natural light., A simple backdrop will give your newborn full focus. Try creating your own backdrop by hanging a solid-colored blanket, duvet, or curtain by the natural light source.You can use thumbtacks to hang the backdrop or drape it over a pair of tall chairs.
Go for a solid, neutral color like black or beige.
 Try swaddling your baby in a blanket or just pose them in a diaper. Cover a bean bag with a soft, solid-colored sheet or baby blanket that will be comfortable for your newborn. Place the bean bag in front of the backdrop, then lay the newborn on the bean bag.If you want to photograph your newborn in the nude or without a diaper, try placing a puppy potty pad under the sheet to avoid soiling the bean bag.

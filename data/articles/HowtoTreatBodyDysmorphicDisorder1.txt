 Cognitive behavioral therapy is the best treatment options for BDD. CBT is a form of psychotherapy where you work with a therapist to change your patterns of thinking in order to change your behaviors as well as find alternate ways to react to your BDD.


Since BDD manifests mostly as negative behaviors related to negative thought patterns, you will work with your therapist to figure out why you act the way you do and how to change it to reflect a more positive body image.
CBT for BDD will work with methods such as exposure and response prevention, which will help you stop checking mirrors, dressing to camouflage yourself, or other negative behaviors.
You may also go through acceptance and commitment therapy, which will help you learn to tolerate those thoughts and behaviors you cannot change. This is especially helpful if you have resistant BDD.;
, Although BDD does not have a specific medication dedicated to it, your doctor may prescribe medication as part of your treatment plan. These typically include the SSRI class of antidepressants, which help replace the hormone serotonin in your body.


This includes medications such as Celexa, Lexapro, Prozac, Paxil, or Zoloft.
Your doctor will let you know about specific doses and schedules to take these medications., When you are diagnosed with BDD, you likely will have another underlying disorder, such as anxiety, depression, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Your therapist or doctor will diagnose these other conditions and make a treatment plan to treat both.


CBT, medications, and other treatments for BDD often work for the underlying disorders as well.

 Exit the Vault to begin.;
, The Alien Blaster will become available at random times.
 Availability will be signaled by a UFO rocketing past you in the sky.
 If you lose it, don't worry. It crash lands just East of Oberland Station.
 It will be abandoned, with a blood trail leading away.
 Equip a gun and enter the cave.
 He will be huddling near the end of the cave with some scrounged supplies near a corpse.
 While hidden, shoot the alien. Make sure it doesn't have a chance to fight back, as the Alien Blaster has devastating effects.
 You will find the Alien Blaster and several hundred rounds.

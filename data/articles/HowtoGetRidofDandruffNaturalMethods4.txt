 Dandruff is caused when your scalp sheds dead skin cells. It is not caused by hair itself.


The Mayo Clinic recommends washing your hair every day with a dandruff shampoo until the flakes subside, and then continuing to wash your hair with the anti-dandruff shampoo 2-3 times per week.Excessive shampooing, especially with harsher chemicals, such as lauryl sulfate, can irritate the scalp and dry it out, causing more dandruff.
 If you choose to wash your hair with dandruff shampoo, leave the shampoo in for at least 5 minutes before you wash it off. This will give the shampoo time to work.
 Brushing your hair will help distribute the oil that is naturally occurring in your scalp and hair over the entire surface of your head.Starting at your scalp, brush outward to help distribute oil from the scalp along your entire head.
 Stress can cause dandruff, so try to exercise your stress away or deal with your stress in other healthy, effective ways.


Eat healthily. What you put into your body has an impact on what your body responds with. An excess of unhealthy foods (fast food, sugary foods, etc.) will often result in skin, scalp and hair problems.
Foods rich in zinc and vitamin B6 are particularly important for maintaining healthy hair and scalp.

,, The result is the quick calorie count number and is the average calories per ounce.
 This number is a constant, but can be adjusted to 34 for a low calorie meal or 38 for a high calorie meal. The quick count number (average calories per ounce) should be within the vicinity of 36.
 A meal might be 13 oz x 36 or 468 calories. The rest of the meal might be items like beverages, salad, soups or fruits and these have to be individually measured and counted. Use the quick calorie count for foods that are similar to those of frozen dinners which represent the majority of foods in a meal. Weighing a plate of food is a lot easier (and with less dishes to wash) than weighing the parts of the whole.
 Counting calories is easy for snacks and because it is simple to determine the calories for a candy bar, fruit or glass of milk.
 Portion control is useful when without a scale. This method of counting calories is effective too, but it takes preparation, for example a deck of cards might be the amount of proteins allowed at each meal.

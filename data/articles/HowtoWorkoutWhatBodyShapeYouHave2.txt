 Choose comfortable bras with good support that aren’t too tight around the chest. If the bra is too tight it will create “lumps” on your back that will be visible through clothing. Similarly, don’t wear underwear that are too tight as that can create the dreaded “muffin top” look. Wear clothes that fit properly to flatter your figure.
 If you love your bust then wear tops that are fitted and low cut. Tops that have a tie, belt, or cinch your waist further accentuate your curves. If you are fond of your hips, again, wear clothes that fit slim around your waist and hug your hips like skinny jeans or yoga pants.Improve your posture. Stand with your back straight and your shoulders back. This will lengthen your waist and make you look slimmer while simultaneously flattering your bust., This can include baggy shirts and large sweaters or shirts with frills on the front. Bulky clothing hides the small part of your waist and can make you appear heavier than you are. Instead, wear dresses, shirts, and jackets that cinch in at the waist.Depending on how heavy your lower body is, you may feel that “skinny” pants make you look bulky as well. If that’s the case, consider wearing straight leg or flared pants to balance your legs.
Avoid horizontal stripes. This pattern can make a hourglass figure look very bulky and unbalanced.

 In order to protect copyright on photos Instagram does not allow you to save someone's photo directly from the app. While this may be a pain, remember that is to restrict people from downloading your work.


Never save or use another person's work for profit.
Always attribute the original photographer when sharing someone's work.
Only Instagram can legally save photos from the app and sell them to an advertising agency.;
, Search online for "download user instagram photos" to choose a site that works for you. These sites allows you to search for any username and save their photos without hassle. Find the user you want, then click on the image. At the bottom of the page will be a button allowing you to "Save Image."These sites works on mobile browsers as well, and an Instagrabbr app is forthcoming.Try sites like instagrabbr.com and Free Instagram Downloader, both of which have been suggested by tech sites like CNET.
 Search "Save Instagram" to find appropriate apps. Available on both Android and iOS phones, these apps ask you to log in to your Instagram account and request "access." Once you allow them access, you can click and download any photos in your photo stream, as well as photos by your Instagram friends. Most of these apps are free.


Allowing access means that the app and its developer has the right to take information from your Instagram account.
Sometimes these apps become outdated with phone updates, so try multiple apps if you are having technical difficulties.Good apps to try include InstaSave, SaveGram, Instagrab, GramDrive Downloader, My InstaAlbum, and more.

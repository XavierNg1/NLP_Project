 Position the apple upwards and start slicing them from the sides to the middle, so you achieve round circles.


Discard the bottom and top portion of the apple.;
, Ensure you get close to the edges of each circle.
 Use four toothpicks for each apple slice, on the peanut butter side. Prick them in even distances from each other, such as near the four edges.
 Take another apple slice and layer it (peanut butter spread up) on top of the toothpicks.


Gently put a little pressure, ensuring that the top apple slice is secured.
 Position them in between the apple slices, standing up, around the peanut butter.
 Insert a Gummy bear on the top of the carousel roof to finish the snack.

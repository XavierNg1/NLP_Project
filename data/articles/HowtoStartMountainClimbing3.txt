 This includes a good pair of climbing shoes, a rock climbing harness, climbing slings and ropes, a top-quality helmet, and chalk bags to improve grip. Several other climbing-specific items are available, but most are designed for more experienced climbers.
 The choice can actually be a difficult one, particularly if you’re looking for the right balance between something that will challenge you and something that won’t leave you feeling discouraged. The best option would be to choose a climb in which someone else will be accompanying you, both from a safety standpoint and as an opportunity to gain feedback.
 Or hill. Or rock wall. You’ve gone from thinking about it to doing it. Feel proud!

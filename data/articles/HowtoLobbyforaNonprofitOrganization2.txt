 It generally defines lobbying as an attempt to influence legislation, executive appointments and constitutional amendments.
 Communicate with legislative officials and staff members by discussing specific legislation and sharing your organization's views on that legislation.


Remember that written communications such as letters and emails addressed to elected officials or legislative bodies is considered direct lobbying.
 This will help you get support for your issue or cause.
 You can advocate for general ideas, such as equal education for children with disabilities. However, when you mention a specific law or potential legislation, it becomes lobbying.


Conduct advocacy and education initiatives without limit. That sort of activity does not come with IRS review or regulation.
 If you choose the expenditure rule, you will need to file form 5768 with the IRS. You will also need to disclose how much time and money your organization spent lobbying in each fiscal year.


Check with your state government for reporting and registration requirements as well. Each state is different, and your Secretary of State should be able to provide the requirements for your organization.
 No nonprofit organization can intervene in a political campaign, make an endorsement or speak out in favor of or against a candidate running for office.

 There are multiple methods to doing so; among them are:


Have a game where you can get a Charmander, either as a starter or as a special Pokémon that you obtain, and soft reset (A+B+Start+Select on a Game Boy, Game Boy Color, or Game Boy Advance, and L+R+Start+Select on a DS or 3DS) until you get a shiny Charmander.
Breed for one. The easiest method is through the Masuda method, which gives you a higher chance of breeding a shiny Pokémon if the two Pokémon you breed with come from different countries.
(for X and Y) Find a Friend Safari with Charmander in it and go into it. Encounter Pokémon until you find a shiny Charmander.
Find one on the GTS and trade for it.;
,, Ultimate power is now yours.

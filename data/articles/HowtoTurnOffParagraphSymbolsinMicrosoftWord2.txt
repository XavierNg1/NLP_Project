 Sometimes, only certain formatting marks are set to show up in the document, which means the Show/Hide formatting marks button may not work. Instead, click on “File” and then “Options.”

, Under “Display” look at the section marked “Always show these formatting marks on the screen.” You should see a checked box labelled "paragraph marks".
 At this point you can also turn off any other formatting marks you want to remove, like spaces, hidden text and object anchors.
 The paragraph marks will no longer appear automatically in any of your documents.

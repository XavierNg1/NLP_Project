 While doing so, establish the character of the questioned person. This may involve their occupation, musical preferences, family, etc. During this preliminary chat look for signs if the person is nervous and scared, prone to bragging, confident or not. Mark their level of intelligence and adapt to it.;
, This way you'll be able to notice the interviewed person's reaction. Remember that in 9 out of 10 cases the first impressions are the most correct.
 Look for inconsistencies. Being too detailed often shows the person has been prepared for questioning and has had the time to make their story up.
 Your associate must pretend to say something in your ear. Give the interviewed person a short look and excuse yourself.
 At this time the suspect should be worried as to what has happened during your leave.
 Then proceed to ask the suspect about the inconsistent points in his story.
 Some questions, like the color of a hit-and-run vehicle are easy to answer and the suspect saying they don't remember is an obvious attempt to conceal something. On the other hand, it would be strange for the interrogated person to have seen or remember the license number, so answering this question would show them having thought the whole thing over.
, These may include crossing the hands (defensive position), sitting on the edge of the chair, too relaxed posture, tilting their head to the right, looking up as they think of the answer.
 shows that the suspect is lying. People who believe in what they say do not appeal to the listener's trust.
 This way you can see whether they're willing to answer your questions correctly.
 For example, if the hit-and-run has been driving on the suspect's side of the road(assuming you're in a right-side traffic country), it's strange for the suspect to say the car had a scratch on the left side. How have they seen it? These little details most often reveal a liar.
 It does not mean they're a criminal.

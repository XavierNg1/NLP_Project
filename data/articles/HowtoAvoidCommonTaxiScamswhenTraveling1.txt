 It is always smart to have a general idea of where you are going and what the fastest route should be before entering a taxi. Some taxi drivers will scam tourists by taking them on longer "scenic" routes in order to run up the meter, making the trip more expensive.When you enter the taxi say “you are going to take X highway to the hotel right?” This will signal to the driver that you know your way around and will help to avoid a potential scam.
Despite your best research, depending on the time of day and traffic, there may be faster alternate routes. Some cabs will take a longer distance route to avoid getting stuck in rush hour traffic.;
, In some countries tipping a taxi driver is not customary, in other areas taxis will add on charges for baggage, additional passengers, or rush hour service. You should always do some research prior to your trip in order to get a general idea of common taxi customs and regulations. This will allow you to know what to expect and it will be easier to spot a scam.For instance, if a taxi tries to charge you for extra baggage, but that is not customary to the area then it is likely a scam.
 It is always best to have the cab driver use the meter and pay the price that shows up on the meter. That being said some drivers can scam you by charging the busy evening or weekend rate during the day. Some drivers may claim the meter is broken and try to charge you an excessive rate. As a result it is a good idea to know the going rate in advance.For example, you can ask your concierge for the standard rate from the hotel to the airport. This will help you to avoid being overcharged.
For some cities you can look up fares and prices for common taxi routes online using the website www.taxifarefinder.com.
Before getting into a cab, ask the driver how much the fare should be. They will not be able to give you an exact amount due to potential traffic, but they can likely give you a general idea of the rate.

 Consciously lower your Adam's apple by slowly swallowing, the last movement of a swallow before your throat goes up is the position you want. Another way is to lower the back of your tongue into your throat. This sounds difficult but play around with it till you find something that works.
 If your close friends or family suddenly hear you go from a 1st soprano to a bass you're going to be found out and have decongestants thrown at you. In conversation say a few words at the beginning and end of a sentence in a lower tone. Just be subtle.Trying to speak too deep too soon not only will seem conspicuous, it can do serious damage to your vocal chords over time. Be careful, and reign it back if you start to feel serious strain., Whenever you find yourself speaking and you've forgotten to try to consciously lower your pitch, just take a deep breath, clear your throat, and finish whatever you were saying with a lower voice. Ending sentences with a high pitch indicates a question, therefore, consciously lowering the end of your sentences will help you sound more confident., Like any other habit, you will forget often at first. With enough practice, what once was a conscious habit will become something you do unconsciously. The only key is to continue consciously speaking in a deeper tone until it becomes natural.

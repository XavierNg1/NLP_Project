 You’ll need book adhesive, knitting needles or plastic rods (for applying the adhesive), wax paper, and a piece of flat plastic. It’s best if your adhesive is in a tall bottle, since this will allow you to cover the needles or plastic rods for application to the spine., Then very gently, use one hand to open the gap between the pages and the hinge as far as possible without causing more damage., Then gently insert the needle or rod into the gap between the pages and spine and twirl it against both the text block and the spine. This should ensure an even coat of adhesive to both parts, which will help it adhere better.If there is a gap all along the entire spine of the book, you’ll need to flip the book over so it’s resting on its top and repeat the process.
 Firmly and evenly press the text block so that it is flat against the spine. Then use your piece of flat plastic to press the endpaper (the blank pages at the beginning of the book) into the hinge. This helps make sure that all of the pages stick to the spine and none of them tear., You should press it back as far into the hinge as it will go. This prevents any adhesive from leaking out onto the cover of the book and will make sure your book opens properly when it’s dry., This is the little indent between the edge of the spine and the cover of the book. Apply even pressure as you run your plastic along this ridge., Set the book on top of a flat board, with a knitting needle slightly thicker than the cover of the book resting on top of the bottom board. Place the book on the bottom board, lining up the knitting needle with the hinge of the book. Repeat this process with a knitting needle resting on the top hinge and another board on top. Set about 10 lbs (4.5 kg) of weight on top of the book and leave it overnight.

 The best way to store nonstick pans is by hanging them from a pot rack. This will store pans without allowing them to rub up against, or touch, any other pots or pans. It will also eliminate the possibility of scratching your pans by stacking them.Hanging pot racks are also a great space saver in the kitchen.
You can purchase a pot rack at Walmart, Bed, Bath, and Beyond, or any store that sells kitchen supplies.
 If you do not have the ability to hang your pans, you can store them stacked. When stacking or nesting pans, make sure that you put a napkin or towel between each pan. This will help make sure that the pans do not scratch each other when you are removing them from the cupboard.A tea towel works best, but you can also use a thinner paper towel.
 Nonstick pans typically last around five years before they need to be replaced. If you have purchased a high quality nonstick pan, it may last slightly longer. Once the surface of the pan becomes pitted or starts to peel, then you should replace the pan immediately.,

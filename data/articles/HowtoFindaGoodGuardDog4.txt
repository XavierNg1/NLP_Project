 A guard dog should be able to socialize, bond, and protect the entire family. As soon as the dog enters the house, introduce them on a leash to each person living in the home. Encourage all family members to pet and interact with the dog. This will let them start to bond with their family, and it can foster loyalty to the family soon after their arrival.
 If you have a puppy, you should begin socializing them immediately. Bring different strangers into the house to meet and interact with the puppy. This will train your puppy that not all strangers are bad, and it can help them more accurately judge a bad situation, instead attacking or lunging at every single person who enters your home.A good guard dog should be aloof towards strangers. This means that they recognize strangers and may even bark at strangers, but they will not lunge towards, attack, or bite strangers.You do not have to worry about socialization reducing the effectiveness of the guard dog. Proper socialization will reduce fear and aggression in the dogs, and it will teach them the difference between a positive experience with a stranger and a negative one.
 Guard dogs require extensive training. They should respond to simple commands. Not only should they act in situations to protect you, but they must back off once you command them to stop. Training should begin as young as possible. Use positive reinforcement, and reward the dog with treats when they do something correctly. This will give you better results than yelling or physically disciplining the dog.You will need to train your dog how to:


Bark on command
Stop barking on command
Leave strangers alone

 Some people prefer not to use alcohol in their hand sanitizer, since alcohol has a strong smell and can have a severe drying effect on skin. Using a witch-hazel based sanitizer is a great alternative.Tea tree oil provides additional antiseptic benefits. Here's what you'll need:


1 cup pure aloe vera gel (preferably without additives)
1 1/2 teaspoons witch hazel
30 drops tea tree oil
5 drops essential oil, such as lavender or peppermint
Mixing bowl
Spoon
Funnel
Plastic container

, If the mixture seems too thin, add another spoonful of aloe vera to thicken it. If it's too thick, add another spoonful of witch hazel.
 Since the smell of the tea tree oil is already strong, go easy on the added essential oils. Five or so drops should be enough, but if you want to add more, stir it in one drop at a time.
 Place the funnel over the mouth of the container and pour the hand sanitizer in. Fill it up, then screw on the lid until you're ready to use it.A small squirt bottle works well if you want to carry the sanitizer with you throughout the day.
If you make too much for the bottle, save the leftover sanitizer in a jar with a tightly-fitted lid.

 Pre-op notes should be written for all of The Attending Surgeon's patients in including day op patients. Results of every ordered test should be in the notes.


The Attending Surgeon will want to have a pre-op note written on all of his/her patients (chest x-ray, EKG, laboratory, culture). On outpatient surgery, these notes should be written at least the day before surgery and then put in the chart the day of surgery (the objective of a pre op note is to be sure that we do not operate on a patient who is not in condition for surgery â€“ checking labs after the patient is asleep will not accomplish that goal!) The Attending Surgeon will be especially unsatisfied with notes documenting that laboratory or other tests have been ordered but not documenting their results. If this material is not documented, the PGII responsible will assist only. Contact The Attending Surgeon about any problems IN ADVANCE.;

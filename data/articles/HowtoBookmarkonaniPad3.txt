 If you visit a particular site a lot, you may want to cut down on the number of taps you need to open it by placing a shortcut directly on your Home screen. This will let you open the site without having to open Safari and then having to select the bookmark.
 This looks like a box with an arrow coming out of the top, and can be found to the right of the address bar.
 This will add the current site to your Home screen.
 Before the shortcut is added, you'll have a chance to edit it. By default, the shortcut will have the same name as the title of the webpage.
 If you need to make an adjustment to the address, you can do so before saving the shortcut. This can be useful if you actually wanted to shortcut the main page but are currently on a subpage.
 It will be immediately added to your Home screen. If you have multiple Home screens, you will need to scroll to find it.

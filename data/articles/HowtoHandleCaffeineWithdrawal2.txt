 Caffeine withdrawals can disrupt your sleep patterns. You may not be able to fall asleep and you may wake up a lot during the night. Melatonin is a substance your body naturally produces to help promote sleep. Supplements can help you fall asleep and reestablish normal sleeping patterns. Take the supplement about 45 minutes to an hour before you want to fall asleep.Caffeine messes up your circadian rhythms, so melatonin can help you naturally get that rhythm back.
 Your body is detoxing from the caffeine while you go through withdrawal. Some of your organs, like your bowels, may be adjusting to functioning with caffeine to stimulate them. Vitamin and mineral supplements may help your body adjust better as you get off caffeine.Supplements you may want to try include vitamin C, magnesium, calcium, potassium, zinc, and B-vitamins.
You can also increase your intake of fruits and vegetables to increase the amount of vitamins and minerals you eat.

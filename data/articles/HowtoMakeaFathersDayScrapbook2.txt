 This is an important step if you are using old photographs, but it may not be applicable if you are using digital copies. Scan in old photographs to your computer, then print new versions before gluing pictures to a page, then save the old photographs for traditional photo albums.
 This will help to express your themes. Write/type on the top of the page or use scrapbook stickers to spell out the title, such as "Vacation 2012" or "Daddy's Little Girl."

, Glue the elements to the page and allow them to dry very well before placing it in your book. A scrapbook page can be simple, featuring 1 or 2 photos, or it can be filled with photos, poems and decorations.


If your young child wants to make a Father's Day scrapbook, create glueless pages out of contact paper. Buy a 3 ring binder and measure pages that will fit in the binder. Cut pieces of contact paper in that size and gather elements, such as photos, stickers and children's art. Your child can lay the elements on the sticky side of the contact paper after the protective sheet has been removed. Place another piece of contact paper over the top when they are finished. Use a 3 hole punch on the page and stick it in a binder.
 Whether you are printing from a digital layout or crafting a physical copy by hand, leave blank pages at the end of the scrapbook. You can update the scrapbook every year or occasionally as an extra present to your dad.
 Include a good picture of the family or the 2 of you together. Print out the final copy or place all the dried pages inside the binder.

 Try writing on hard-boiled eggs with markers. You can try permanent markers, like Sharpies, or if you have children, you can use non-toxic markers. Using different colors, write on the eggs and draw designs. You can write on undyed eggs or colored eggs.You may want to write on the eggs in sections and let the colors dry before moving on. This can help keep your fingers from getting covered in marker ink.
Use old toilet paper rolls cut to a smaller height to hold the eggs while you are writing on them.
 Paint your egg with watercolor paint instead of dyeing them. Then, use watercolor pencils to write words or draw designs on the wet paint. Let the eggs dry.Watercolors are not permanent, so the color may come off easily. This can be a fun way to write on Easter eggs, but be aware the designs will not last like dyeing them.
 Write on your eggs like you do other chalkboard crafts. Paint hard-boiled eggs with black chalkboard paint. Let the eggs dry completely. Use white or colored chalk to draw designs or write words onto the eggs., Another way to write on Easter eggs is to use ink and a stamp. You can use plain black ink or buy a colored ink pad set. You may also use any stamps you have, or buy a set of Easter-themed stamps.Dye the hard-boiled eggs any color you'd like. Then, choose a stamp color that will show up on the egg. Dip the stamp into the ink and then tap the stamp to shake off excess ink.
To stamp the egg, carefully roll the stamp back and forth over the curved egg shell until the ink adheres to the shell.
Do this as many times with as many stamps as you'd like. You can use the same or different stamps, and try different colors. Just make sure to wash the stamp between each color you use.

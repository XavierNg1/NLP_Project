 When you start the race, it is important to establish a position in one of the outside lanes. Staying in the second or third lane will prevent you from getting boxed in, which typically happens when you run in the first lane.Make sure to position yourself near the front of the pack as well.
 During the middle of the race, position yourself behind the leaders and maintain a steady pace. This way, if you are running against the wind, the leadersâ€™ bodies will block most of it, helping you to conserve energy.Additionally, make sure to pay attention to the leaders. Only speed up your pace if the leaders speed up their pace.
 When you have 300 meters left to run, accelerate your pace. Once you hit the 200-meter mark, accelerate to an all-out sprint. If you are behind the leaders at this point, then move yourself to an outside lane and propel yourself forward to get ahead. Maintain your speed until you reach the finish line.Make sure you stay in the second or third lane at the 300-meter mark to avoid getting boxed in.

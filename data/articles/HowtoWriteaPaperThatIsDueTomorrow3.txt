 Once you have a draft, you need to start the revision process. First, check your content. Make sure that your ideas are clearly explained and that you have used appropriate word choices in each paragraph. Ensure that your essay flows together in a logical order, rather than feeling jumbled or thrown together.


Next, check for spelling and grammatical errors. You'll need to correct them, as mechanical errors will greatly detract from your reader's ability to trust you as an authority on your subject. Make sure that your spell check is also set to check grammar and style., Reading your paper out loud can help you catch errors that you may have missed by reading silently. When you hear the words spoken, you are more likely to notice any awkward phrasing. This is a great method to use when editing any paper., By now, you are probably pretty tired. It's a good idea to get some rest (sleep, if possible) before you give your paper a final look. Rest will help your brain recharge and your focus will be more clear. If you don't have time for a nap, take a few minutes to just rest your eyes. Your body and your mind need to recharge.
 After you've rested, it is time to give your paper one final look. Make sure that you have completed all of the required components. Now you can hand your paper in with confidence.

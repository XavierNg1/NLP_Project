 The off command, though highly effective, does require you to be present and observe your pet climbing onto off-limits furniture. This technique works better for dogs, since dogs tend to respond to verbal commands better than cats. When you observe your dog climbing onto a couch or chair he's not supposed to be on, rather than physically removing him (which may elicit an aggressive reaction from him), teach him the "off" command., As soon as you observe your dog on the couch or chair, use a calm-yet-stern voice to say, "Off." Then hold a small treat in front of his face, and pull the treat (with your dog's nose in tow) slowly away from the couch or chair and down to the floor., As soon as your dog gets down from the furniture, offer him verbal praise and give him the treat you led him away with. Start out giving him treats every time he climbs down, then gradually taper off how frequently you give treats with the "off" command. Eventually you should be able to command your dog to get off the furniture simply by saying, "Off."

 Some baby toys make great cat toys. Usually, toys that are safe enough for infants are safe enough for cats because there are no small parts that can come off easily. Examples of suitable baby toys include: clear plastic balls with spinners inside that twirl when the ball stops rolling, or small stuffed animals that rattle. You could also use old, light, stuffed animals or finger puppets as toys for your cats.

 Some shampoos, conditioners, and styling products contain keratin. Using these products consistently over time may help build up protein on your hair that makes it smoother and softer.Look for these products at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store – they should be clearly labeled. Some examples include:


Keratin Complex Shampoo
It’s a 10 Miracle Shampoo Plus Keratin
KeratinPerfect shampoo by Sephora
Suave Color Care Keratin Infusion shampoo
Keranique Volumizing Shampoo for Thinning Hair

, Use hair products that are enriched with vitamin E, vitamin B5, iron, zinc, and copper. It’s possible that these nutrients can increase your hair’s keratin production. Look for these nutrients on the label or on the ingredients list.

 There are really only two methods of live capture, and unless you want to stay up very late or get up very early to try to capture the varmint with a net, you'll probably choose method 2. Method 2 involves letting a live trap do the dirty work for you.;
, Now that you have decided on the easiest (but very possibly not permanent) method of capture you'll need a trap. You could buy one or make your own. Choices for factory produced traps include Havahart and Advantek.
 Find an entrance that looks like it has been used recently.
 Look for signs that reveal the normal path that the armadillo uses for egress and ingress into that particular burrow entrance.
 Place the trap 6–8 feet (1.8–2.4 m) from the opening parallel with the path you identified in the last step.
 Using scrap plywood, 2x4's, garden fencing or whatever else you may have on hand, create a funnel. Starting with the widest point of the funnel at the opening of the burrow making an unbroken funnel culminating at the opening of the trap being the same width as the trap opening.
 Earthworms are best as other types of bait may attract other unwanted animals like raccoons, and cats. Place some earthworms in some hosiery, making a small sack of bait. The hosiery will hold the bait and allow the smell to permeate the air in hopes of attracting our pesky garden wrecker. Actually the bait may be a more of symbolic gesture as an armadillo's sight is not very good and your funnel will lead him right to the trap.

Use your Visa gift card anywhere Visa debit and credit cards are accepted.
Your Visa gift card allows access to the prepaid funds only and does not represent a line of credit. Because of this, attempts to authorize more than the card's remaining balance will be denied. This can cause problems at merchants, such as gas stations, which may authorize more than the actual purchase being made.



Some merchants, such as Barnes & Noble, Target and Dillard's can check your remaining Visa gift card balance when you make a purchase.

 If you want to prevent other friendships from falling apart, it helps to know why your friend no longer wants to be part of your life. There are many reasons why a friendship ends, so you may need to speak to other friends to help get some perspective on where the relationship went wrong.Many friendships end because of a specific act or betrayal, such as hooking up with a friend’s significant other. It doesn’t need to be such a serious breach of trust, though. If you’re constantly late for plans or always cancel at the last minute, a friend might decide that she’s had enough too.
Some friends simply drift apart over time because they no longer share common interests or circumstances. For example, if you and your friend met in school and you’re longer students, the relationship may not work as well.
Significant changes in you and your friend’s lifestyles can cause a relationship to end. If your friend has settled down and gotten married and you’re still happily single, you two may not be compatible anymore.
 Don’t just analyze the friendship that ended; examine all of the relationships in your life to see if similar issues have cropped up before. That will help you identify problems that you may want to work on when it comes to other friendships.If you’re having trouble finding patterns -- or don’t know what to do about them -- it can help to speak to a therapist or counselor.
 When you’re hurt and angry about the end of a friendship, it’s human nature to want to place all of the blame on the friend who dumped you. But if you want have better, healthier friendships in the future, it helps to acknowledge how you may have contributed to the end of the relationship.


Don’t be too hard on yourself if you made mistakes in the friendship. Instead, make an effort to learn from them.

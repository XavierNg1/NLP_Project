 Any number in the world, but it's best to start with the simpler ones.


Take 72, for example, but the number could be denoted by a variable.
 There are many methods of doing this, but usually, the simplest way is to make a factor tree. This works because according to number theory, every integer (except -1, 0, and 1) has a number of prime numbers that, when multiplied together, will equal the number. Remember that 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.


72 should be factorized into 2 and 36, 2, 6, and 6, and finally, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, which equals 23*32.



In the example 23 and 32, the exponents are 3 and 2 - adding one to each will make them 4 and 3.



4 x 3 = 12. There are 12 factors for the number 72 - 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.
 Now, because x1 = x, 29, 13, and 5 all have exponents to the first power.
Add exponents by one. 3, 2, 2, 2.
Multiply the modified exponents together. There are 24 factors of the number 7540.;
, There are four factors of the number 15802 - 1, 2, 7901, 15802. 7901 is a prime number.

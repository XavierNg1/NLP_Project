 First, get your parents permission and help. Nail a strong rope or string to the wall in a room, or you can tie it to a tall piece of furniture. Nail the string to two opposite sides of the room so that it hangs across the room.
 Take another piece of rope or string and tie/nail it to both sides side of the room, again, with the help of an adult. Do so a few feet away from the first string, so that they run parallel to each other.
 Drape a thin sheet or blanket over the two ropes and let the ends hang down on either side.
 You can place whatever items you want in your tent, as long as there is space.

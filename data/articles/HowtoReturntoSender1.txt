 If you received a letter or package addressed to the wrong person, write this in large, clear letters on the envelope or box, without obscuring the return address. You can do this with unsolicited mail addressed to you as well, but it is completely legal to throw it away or keep it, unlike mail addressed to someone else.If you opened the mail, or someone signed to receive the package, you'll need to put it in a new package and pay for postage. Otherwise, the postal service should handle it free of charge, as long as you complete this within "reasonable time.";
, Add a note so the person who sent the mail knows why it's being returned. If you're returning mail sent to the wrong person, try "Addressee moved" or "Not at this address."If you are receiving large amounts of spam, try "Remove me from your mailing list" â€“ though this is unlikely to be effective.


If you know the person's new address, you can write "No longer at this address, please forward (write new address here)" instead of "Return to Sender."Large businesses usually use mass address lists, and will rarely stop sending materials based on messages written on the envelope. Try the change of address form method below.
 This makes it clear that the letter is not to be delivered to your address again., The postal worker will pick up the letter or package and bring it back to the post office to deal with. Put the flag up on your mailbox if you have one, to let him know there is mail for him to pick up. Otherwise, leave the mail in an obvious location.


If the postal worker fails to notice the mail, put a sticky note on your mailbox saying "mail to be returned." If the mail is still not picked up, take it to the post office in person.

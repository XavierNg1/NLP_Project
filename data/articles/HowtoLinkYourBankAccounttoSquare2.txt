 You can easily link your bank account to Square, using the traditional online method.
 This will let you view or change your account preferences.
 Square requires a traditional bank account to support its services. It does not work with prepaid cards or online-only accounts, such as PayPal.
 Clicking the button will open a new window, wherein you can enter your personal information.
 You need to do the following:


Enter your account name. You will have to enter your name exactly as it appears on your bank account.
Add your account number. Make sure that you have entered it right.
Enter your check routing number. This is the first of the three sets of numbers on the bottom of your checkbook. Click here to Locate a Check Routing Number.
 Square will take up to 5 business days (excluding weekends and holidays) to verify your account.


While verification is in process, you can continue to receive payments on Square. Your balance will be retained in your account and will be released as soon as the process has been completed.

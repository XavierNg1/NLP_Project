 Teaching a dog to respect the threshold is important. You do not want a dog that runs out the door every time it opens â€” that could be dangerous for him. Doorway training doesn't need to happen every single time you go through a doorway. But you should make the most of your training opportunities early in your puppy's life.
 You should have him on a short leash that allows you to change his direction from a close distance.
 Bring the dog along with you on his leash.
 If your dog moves to follow you when you step through the door, use the leash to stop his forward movement. Try again.
 When he realizes that you want him to stay in the door instead of walking through it with you, lavish him with praise and rewards for the "good wait."

, If the door is closed, you can even teach your dog to sit as soon as you place your hand on the doorknob. He'll then wait while the door is opened, and not cross the threshold until you release him. This training should be done on leash at the beginning, for his safety.
 You might use a "come" or a "free." Whatever command you use, it should be the only thing that allows your dog to exit your home.
 Practice leaving the dog at the threshold and do something on the other side. You might get the mail or take out the trash before you return and praise him. The idea is that you do not always call him across the threshold to meet you. You can also come back to him.

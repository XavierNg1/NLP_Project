 Although concerts for adults are not generally recommendable for toddlers, there has in recent years been a rise in what are known as children's concerts. These allow children to dance, jump, and sing-along, and no one will give you dirty looks should your child suddenly start to cry or need to leave to go to the bathroom. Some of these can be cheap or free if they are sponsored by your local government, and other productions may be more expensive.


Ice skating shows for kids incorporate similar ideas but may include copyrighted characters and songs that children know and love from movies and TV shows in addition to being on an ice rink. Most likely there may be less room for movement and dancing.
 Trips that are an hour or longer are very difficult for children to sit through due to their high energy levels. You can help to keep your and your child's stress levels down by incorporating songs like "Old MacDonald" and "The Wheels on the Bus," as they'll help to keep your child entertained and happy for longer. If it's too much for you to be involved in the singing, though, children's cds or radio stations that cater specifically to children can be an excellent way to compromise between your child's enjoyment and your ability to keep your attention on the road.


Music has a very special relationship to memory; hearing a song can bring back in very vivid details special, happy memories years, even decades, later.You can help to ensure that your child will be able to recall special memories from vacations by associating them with music.
 Most if not all mainstream and major holidays will have music associated with them. This music is not only a way of teaching kids about the themes and stories associated with the holiday but it's also a lot of fun, especially since the music returns every year. It's a great way to help build a sense of community within your family as well as a sense of tradition.

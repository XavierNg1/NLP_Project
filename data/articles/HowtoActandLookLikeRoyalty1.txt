 As part of their public duties, members of the royal family are required to attend galas and events. During these outings, the royals must stand with excellent posture for hours. Once you have perfected your posture, you will emanate a regal air.


Bring your heels together and turn out your toes. (This is first position in ballet).
Slide one heel along the inner edge of your foot until it reaches the arch. (This is third position in ballet).

, In an effort to avoid compromising and embarrassing situations, the royals have perfected the art of sitting properly. To practice this skill:


Stand with your back to the chair.
Back up to the chair so that your calves hit the edge of the seat. This will prevent you from missing the chair completely.
Bend your knees as you lower your bottom onto the edge of the seat.
Keep your knees together and slide to the back of the chair.
Slide your feet to one side. Tuck one ankle under the other ankle. This will prevent you from accidentally flashing anyone.
To stand, lean forward, gracefully lift yourself up, and return your feet to third position., Princesses donâ€™t walk, they glide. While their stride appears natural and effortless, it is actually quite technical and challenging to master.


Place all of your weight on your back foot.
As you step forward with your back foot, your heel should brush the instep of your front foot. Your stride should be approximately half a foot length.
Land on your heel, roll through your instep, and end with the weight on your toes.
Repeat.

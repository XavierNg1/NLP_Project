 If you've drawn a picture, place it in with the letter as well. On the back of the envelope, neatly write the vice principal's name. You could also write that the letter is from you.


An example would be:






To: From: , Include a sincere smile to show your friendliness. Although you might be afraid or too embarrassed to give the letter to him/her in person, this shows how willing you are to admit your mistakes, and it also helps convince the vice principal that you truly are sorry.


If the vice principal isn't available, you could leave the letter with one of the secretaries to place in his/her mailbox. Another option is to wait for another time to give him/her the letter, but it's best to send it as soon as possible.
 He/she may not reply right away or at all, but rest at ease. You've admitted your mistakes, and you've been honest enough to include an apology. Whether he/she accepts it or not is out of your control. Know that you've done your part, and you've tried to make amends. Do not live in fear or disappointment with yourself for the rest of your life.

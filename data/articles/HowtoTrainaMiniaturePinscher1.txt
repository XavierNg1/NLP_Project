 It is important to mark your dog’s good behavior right when she does it. Using a clicker can help you to do this. A clicker is a small noisemaker that you can buy in a pet supply store. Use a clicker to mark your dog’s good behavior and help her to learn what you want her to do.For example, if your dog responds to your “Sit” command by sitting, then click the clicker right as her bottom hits the floor. This will help her to associate sitting with doing something good.;
, Treats are excellent for motivating your mini pin to obey your commands. Keep a bag of your mini pin’s favorite treats on hand and reward her with one for following your commands.


Never hold treats in your hand while you are training. This will distract your dog and she will not be able to give you her full attention.Try to vary how often you give your mini pin a treat. Giving a treat after every command can leave your mini pin expecting to be rewarded. Give frequent treats at first and then start to space them out more, such as every other command or every third or fourth command.
 You can also use other things to reward your mini pin for her hard work and obedience during training sessions. For example, you can give your mini pin a new toy, reward her with a belly rub, or take her for a walk., If you always train your mini pin while you are sitting down, then she may associate the command with your body position. Likewise, if you only train your mini pin in the living room, then she may associate the command with the room.Make sure that you vary your training positions and locations to ensure that your mini pin will respond to your commands in any situation.

 Your favorite pillow, stuffed animal, or even pictures of family can turn anyplace into your home away from home. The familiar objects trigger a sense of peace and exert a calming influence on your mind., If you take a shower before bed at home, take a shower before bed wherever you are. Bring the book you’re reading if you normally read before turning out the light. Anything to give bedtime the same feeling and to let your body know it’s time for bed is a good bet to help., You never know if it’s going to be noisy or bright where you’re staying so bringing these along will make sure you’re prepared for everything. A sleep mask will also give you the added benefit of being able to imagine you’re at home without you seeing the evidence to the contrary right before your eyes.

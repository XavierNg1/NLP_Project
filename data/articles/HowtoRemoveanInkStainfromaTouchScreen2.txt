 Baby wipes are moistened disposable tissues meant to clean a baby’s skin. Since they are designed to be gentle and non-abrasive, they are ideal for cleaning ink stains on a touch screen. To use the baby wipe, simply wipe the ink stain with it in a circular motion using gentle pressure.You can use isopropyl alcohol wipes in the same way.Cleaning agents with high concentrations of alcohol could prove damaging to your touch screen, but isopropyl alcohol wipes do not contain high concentrations of alcohol.
After wiping the touch screen with the wipes, use a dry cloth to wipe away any remaining residue.
 Mix equal parts distilled water and 99 percent isopropyl alcohol in a small spray bottle. Spray a bit of the solution onto a clean microfiber cloth. Using a gentle circular motion, rub the ink stain from your touch screen.If any residue remains after cleaning, spray another cloth with distilled water and wipe the touch screen with it.
 Depending on the product you are attempting to clean, you might be able to utilize a specialized cleaning product. The specific directions for use vary with the specialized cleaning product you choose to use. Generally, however, you will simply spray a small amount of the cleaning solution onto your cleaning cloth, then use it to wipe away the ink stain.Consult manufacturer instructions for information about whether a specialized cleaning product could help you remove an ink stain from your touch screen.
 Once you’ve cleaned the ink stain, you should take proactive steps to avoid getting additional ink stains on your touch screen. The best way to do this is to equip your device with a screen protector (a transparent plastic sheet that fits the exact dimensions of your screen).Screen protectors are available online or at most major electronics goods stores.

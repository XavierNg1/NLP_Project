 Grimy herbs will give you more profit, but will take quite a bit longer. Alternatively, you could combine this with the previous method and use the herbs from that. Buy an equal amount of vials to herbs.
 Set a bank present that you will have 14 vials of water and 14 of the herbs. Combine them to make unfinished potions. Almost all the potions will make you profit, the most profitable being fellstalk, which requires 91 herblore.

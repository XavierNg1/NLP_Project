 It is especially good if the glass has a wide mouth with a tapered bottom.;

 Put the two outside tines of the fork over the back of the spoon When they're connected, the utensils should make sort of a boomerang shape.
 Ensure that it is still touching the spoon. Leave as much of the matchstick sticking towards the center of the "boomerang" shape as possible.
 Take the whole kit and (here comes the tricky part) balance the matchstick on the edge of the glass with the two handle ends pointing back towards the glass. Note that the matchstick will be horizontal.
 It might take you a moment to figure out where to place the matchstick. Try moving it from side to side, as well as closer to and farther away from the glass, to locate the best spot.
 Then sit back and collect your bets. The reason that people believe it is defying gravity is the fact that they believe it is balancing relative to the entire cup, rather than just one edge of it. They are, technically, fooling themselves.

 Youâ€™ll need to remove your current flooring to gain access to the subfloor. Remove your carpet, hardwood flooring, linoleum, or tile., Choose a noiseproofing compound, such as Green Glue, to apply to the subfloor. Use a caulk gun to distribute the product evenly across the subfloor. Two tubes of compound should be used for every 4 foot by 8 foot (1.2 m by 2.4 m) area., Some products, like Green Glue, must be placed between two rigid surfaces. Check the label and instructions on your product to see if this is the case. If so, place a hard board, such as cement board or medium-density fiberboard (MDF) on top of the Green Glue., Add a resilient underlayment, such as cork, foam, or shredded rubber, on top of the rigid layer for extra soundproofing. Foam is the least expensive choice. Cork is more expensive but is a better noise insulator. Shredded rubber may be the most expensive but the added mass is most likely to provide the best solution for noise reduction., Place your flooring on top of the board. You can choose to install carpet, hardwood, linoleum, or tile. All of these elements will greatly reduce floor noise.

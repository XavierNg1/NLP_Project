https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/
This will take you to the Chrome download page.;
, Click on the blue “Download Chrome” button to begin downloading the browser. Click “Accept and Install,” and the page should load up, with installation instructions in it.


Windows will then ask you where you want to save the Chrome installer. Specify a directory, and click “Save” to begin downloading.
 The downloaded file should then appear in the bottom of your browser. Click on it when it finishes.
 The installer should initiate, just keep hitting “Next.” Additional files should begin downloading, and all you have to do is wait for the installer to finish downloading everything successfully.
 Click on “Finish,” and the Chrome browser should be present in your desktop.

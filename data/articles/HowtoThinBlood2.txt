 If you have had a heart attack or stroke, or have certain risk factors, your doctor may recommend a daily, 81mg tablet of aspirin. Aspirin thins your blood by preventing blood cells from sticking together, thus decreasing the risk of clots.Be aware, though, that aspirin introduces additional bleeding risks such as a hemorrhagic stroke and GI bleeding.


If you have had stomach ulcers, GI bleeding, or are allergic to aspirin, let your doctor know. If you are taking regularly scheduled NSAIDS such as ibuprofen, you may also increase your chances of bleeding. Let your doctor know before starting an aspirin regimen.
Aspirin may interact with other medications such as heparin, ibuprofen, Plavix, corticosteroids, and antidepressants as well as herbal supplements such as ginkgo, kava, and catâ€™s claw., Exercise is very important in reducing your risk of heart attack and stroke. Although you cannot undo what damage has been done, you can prevent further complications if you include exercise along with your medication.It is recommended that you exercise 150 minutes a week, which is generally broken up into 30 minutes a day of moderate aerobic activity such as brisk walking.Try to avoid exercise that might cause serious injury, complications, or internal bleeding. Ask your doctor what activities are best given your personal history and the medication you are taking.
 Changing your diet can help to prevent further heart problems. Changing your diet can also enhance the effects of your medication to keep your blood thinner and healthier.

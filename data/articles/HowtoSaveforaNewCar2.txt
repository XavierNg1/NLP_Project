 The longer you can keep running it, the better. Unless, of course, your old car is costing you more money than what you can afford to put into it.
 Once the car is paid for (60 months on a standard car loan), keep the car in good operating condition and continue to drive it.
 As you commute with your car to work and elsewhere, make sure to keep making your monthly payments into a savings account.


Scenario = If you make 400 dollar monthly payments on your Jeep, and pay it off in 4 years, the Jeep can be driven for at least another year or two. If you continue to make 400 dollar payments to your savings account for 16 months, you will have a total of 6400 dollars to put down towards a new car. You can do this for longer and be able to pay for the new car in full.
 Many employers allow you to control how you want your paychecks deposited. If possible, have your monthly payment direct-deposited into this new account. This ensures that you won't be tempted to use those funds for other expenses throughout the month., Too many times you may feel tempted to buy a new car when your old one is doing just fine. The Beemers and Benzes are nice, but they'll make you broke unless you can afford it.

 Make sure you start the thawing process early enough so that the meat can finish defrosting by the time you need it.









Bulk packages of ground beef weighing 1 lb (450 g) or less may thaw in less than an hour. A larger package will take longer, however. A 3-lb or 4-lb (1350-g or 1800-g) can take 2 to 3 hours., Place the package inside of a leak-proof plastic bag and seal it up as securely as possible.









If the bag leaks, bacteria could get in through the water or the air. Moreover, you could also end up with mushy, watery ground beef if the ground beef absorbs too much water.
 Place the wrapped package of ground beef in a large bowl or dish and cover it with cold tap water. Make sure that the beef is completely underwater.









Only use cold water. Hot, warm, or even room temperature water can create a breeding ground for bacteria.
Leave the dish of water and the beef out on the counter as it defrosts.
You could also fill a clean sink with cold water and submerge your beef in that. Just make sure that the plug has a tight seal and that the sink is clean before you start.
 Draining the old water and refilling the bowl with clean, cold water will allow the meat to continue defrosting while preventing the water from gathering too much bacteria.
 Once it is soft enough to press, the majority of the ground beef is thawed.









Break the block of ground beef open and press the middle of the inside. If it is still hard, the center of the beef is still frozen.
 In order to prevent bacteria from growing, you need to use ground beef thawed in this manner within 2 hours.









Do not refreeze ground beef thawed in cold water. It is not safe to refreeze raw ground beef defrosted in cold water. If you cannot use it within 2 hours of defrosting it, your best option is to cook it before refreezing it.

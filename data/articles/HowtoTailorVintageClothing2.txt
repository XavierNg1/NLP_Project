 If you want perfectly tailored vintage pants, the first thing you’ll need to do is to make sure they match your leg length exactly. Measure the inseam (from the crotch to the bottom hem) of some pants that you know fit perfectly, then use that measurement to find the correct length for your vintage pants.Use a straight-stitch on your sewing machine to sew the hemline. Try to match the thread to the color of the fabric as closely as possible, unless you want to create a bold outline statement with an off-set colored stitch.
 To get vintage pants fitting properly, you’ll need to adjust the waistline to fit your body type. You can either measure your own waist with a tape measure, or you can measure the waist of some pants you already have that fit well.Remember that you’ll need to add 2 in (5.1 cm) to the measurement of your own waist if you use a tape measure on yourself. The measurement plus 2 in (5.1 cm) is the size you should make the waist of your vintage pants.
You will need to let the waist in or out, depending on the size of the pants compared to your own size.
 Depending on when the vintage clothing was made, you will probably need to adjust the way they fit in order to make them work with your more modern wardrobe. Try to cut and sew along existing seams to maintain as much of the original design as possible.You should keep trying on the clothing as you work on it to make sure the fit is still what you want.
 Many vintage style pants will be a baggier or more wide-legged style, so you may have to tailor the legs for a tighter fit. To do so, you’ll need to use your seam rippers to open the seams up. Then measure the material to the desired length and pin it. After the pining, you should try the pants back on to ensure you have the right fit. Then sew the seam back up to finish the look.

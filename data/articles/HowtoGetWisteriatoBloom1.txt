 Winter pruning for wisteria is best done in February on a mild day. Then, pruning in the summer will cut back on the unruly growth and keep the plant in check. It is important to restrict the vegetative growth so that the flowering spurs are encouraged to blossom.Pruning in the winter is generally easier because the leaves have been shed and the framework of the plant is exposed.;
, The shoots are the new branches that have grown since the summer. They should be cut back so that there are only three to five buds per shoot. This will generally mean that three to four inches will be cut off each one.


Pruning the branches will direct the plant’s energy to flowering. , While the shoots can be cut back, the main woody frame of the plant should not be cut. Maintaining a strong frame will ensure that the integrity of the plant remains intact.
 This creates better air circulation and allows the sunlight to reach the new growth. This improves the chances of the formation of flower buds., For older plants, it is necessary to remove branches that are run-down and branches that have grown over structural features of buildings, such as windows and doors.


This is known as a “hard prune” and it will stimulate strong growth, as this is a plant that can grow aggressively. To avoid this, avoid fertilizing in the first spring after the hard prune., Many gardeners find the seedpods of the wisteria plant to look decorative. You can leave the seedpods if you enjoy how the look; otherwise, it is acceptable to remove them.

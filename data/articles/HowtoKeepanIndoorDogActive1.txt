 Find a soft rope dog toy, and shake it in front of the dog. When they grab on to it, hold onto the rope to play tug-of-war. Do not let go easily. Let the dog tug for a few minutes before one of you wins. The dog may bring the rope back to you to play again., You can play fetch indoors with your dog, as long as you use soft toys instead of hard or bouncy balls. Find a toy like a stuffed animal, squeaky toy, or felt ball. Toss it a few feet away. Say “fetch” or "go get it" as you throw. The dog should pick the toy up and bring it back to you. Toss it again until either you or the dog is tired.Even with a soft toy, you should not aim it towards anything breakable or valuable.
 Puzzle toys keep your dog mentally and physically engaged. Put a treat or some kibble inside. Watch as your dog tries to get it out. For an extra challenge, hide the food puzzles around the house. Your dog will be able to smell the treats inside, and they’ll hunt around to find them.Many puzzle toys are plastic containers with buttons and a compartment for a treat. Your dog will paw and press the buttons until the compartment opens.
Some puzzle toys are balls that your dog must roll and turn to free the treat.
You can fill a KONG toy with peanut butter. Your dog will spend a long time trying to lick it out.

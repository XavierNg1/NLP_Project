 You must provide warm water to maintain the health of your betta fish. To do this, you will need to get a heater for your aquarium. The type of heater you need will vary, depending on how large your aquarium is. The two main types of heaters should be available at your local pet supply store.Tanks larger than 2.5 gallons will need a submersible aquarium heater.
For tanks between 2.5 and 5 gallons, you will need a 25 watt power rating. For 10 gallon tanks, purchase a 50 watt heater.
Tanks that are smaller than 2.5 gallons can use submersible 7.5 watt heater pads. These pads don't regulate temperature, so you will need to monitor the temperature of the tank often.
Lamps are not the best choice for heating as betta fish do not like bright lighting.;
, The easiest way to keep an eye on the temperature in your betta's aquarium is to install a thermometer. You will need a thermometer that is designed to be submerged into the tank water. Once your thermometer is installed you can easily check to make sure your betta is in an ideal environment.Temperatures need to be maintained at 76 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 to 26 degrees Celsius.
Place the thermometer in a place that you can easily read it.
Thermometers that stick on the side of the aquarium are often not accurate enough to use.
 Consider where the best place in your house might be for your aquarium. Look for areas that are more stable in terms of temperature, naturally helping to maintain the temperature in your tank.Avoid placing the tank next to any drafty windows or cool areas in your house.
Don't put the aquarium next to a heat source.

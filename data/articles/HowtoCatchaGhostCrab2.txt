 Ghost crabs are constantly on the look out for predators. Make yourself invisible (like them) by wearing dark colored clothing. You’ll also want to walk softly, and stay quiet., You’ll have the most fun catching ghost crabs if you do so during their peak season. The best time of year for catching ghost crabs is during the summer, from May to early September., Ghost crabs can be found on coastal beaches around the world, for example in Costa Rica, Hawaii, and the Atlantic coast of the United States. But the best beaches within these regions to boast ghost crabs will be quiet, secluded places, without a lot people. Look for a beach that fits this bill to see the most ghost crabs., Although a pinch from a ghost crab won’t hurt you too badly, it can hurt a little bit. You can minimize your chances of being pinched by a ghost crab, if you treat him with a little respect. Never poke or prod the crab unnecessarily., Although any bucket or small container will work, using one large bucket (that you can share as a family) ensures that your crabs will not escape as you're gathering them. Of course you will release them all at the end of the night anyway, but it is fun to get a sense of how many your captured during your hunt.

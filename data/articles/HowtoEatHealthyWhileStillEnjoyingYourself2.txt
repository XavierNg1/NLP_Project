 Vacations, weddings, and birthdays all present dining temptations. An array of interesting (and often unlimited) foods can go a long way towards weakening your will power.


Carry a few snacks with you, such as raw granola bars, to take the edge off your hunger before hitting the buffet.Gravitate toward the fresh food options, like the salad station, instead of the heavier, saucy dishes. And, in a buffet situation, limit yourself to one plate, no refills.
 Plan a regular dinner time with your family or set-up consistent meal dates with your friends. Sharing meals with other people encourages you to slow down and enjoy your food. Dining peers can also praise your good choices while steering you away from unhealthy options., You will save money and reduce the impact on your waistline. Or, adopt a ‘family-style’ dining mentality and sample a little bit from everyone’s dishes.


For example, at Panera Bread Company, eating a whole Napa Almond Chicken Salad Sandwich on Sesame Semolina provides 700 calories. A seasonal greens salad provides 180 calories. So, if you split the sandwich and salad with a friend, you'll each be consuming 440 calories, which will probably fit into your calorie goals., Focus on citrus and cut up oranges, limes, lemons, etc. to sample. Create attractive food trays and invite others over to turn this into a group adventure.

 The more you get in the habit of cleaning each mess as you make it, the less the messes will pile up. If you make dinner, wash the dishes as you cook. If there are clothes all over your bedroom floor, pick them up before going to bed. If you allow a mess to pile up and sit, it will look much more intimidating than if you take care of it early and often.Never leave a room empty-handed. If you see something that doesn’t belong, take it with you.
If your house has two floors, make a rule that you never go upstairs empty-handed; always bring something with you that needs to be put away upstairs.
Institute the one-minute rule: if something takes under a minute to do, do it right now.
 Cut two lemons in half and place them in a glass dish with some water. Microwave the water until it starts to boil, then allow the bowl to cool in the microwave for a moment. The steam from the bowl should allow you to easily wipe away the mess in your microwave.Allow the water to boil while you wipe down your counters and appliances for a five minute kitchen clean.
Keep an eye on the water in the bowl to make sure it doesn’t boil over. Otherwise, it will take you twice as long to clean up.
 The key to getting everything done within your thirty minute timeframe is to stay focused. For the thirty minutes your timer is on, you only do the chores and tasks you have assigned. Do not allow yourself to get distracted by e-mails, texts or anything else. Work as hard as you can for the thirty minutes allotted, and when your time is up, move on to something else.Reward yourself with a treat or fun activity for completing your work.
Invite friends over to help (but keep in mind, you may end up having to help with their chores as well.)

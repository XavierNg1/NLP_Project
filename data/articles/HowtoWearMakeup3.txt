 Eyeshadows that have a matte finish will result in an overall smoother makeup look. Colours such as brown and taupe can work well on just about everyone. And mauve and plum can help give you a very classic look., Both eyeshadow and eyeliner can fade throughout the day or evening as you wear it. One solution to this problem is using two types of eyeshadow and eyeliner at a time to ensure it lasts longer.For your eyelids you can add an eyeshadow primer underneath your eyeshadow to help it last longer.
Instead of a primer, you can apply cream eyeshadow first and a powder eyeshadow over top. This makes the eyeshadow last longer and can make the colour stand out more.
For eyeliner, use a gel eyeliner as the first layer and add some powder eyeshadow on top make it last longer.
If you do not want to use two different colours, use an eyeshadow colour that matches the lightest part of your face as the base layer. Apply your coloured eyeshadow on top., An eyelash clamp tool is that strange looking things that’s a cross between a pair of scissors and a guillotine. If you decide to use a clamp tool to curl your lashes even more than they are naturally, use it before you apply any mascara. You should clamp each set of eyelashes three times — once at the base, again mid lash and finally at the ends., If your eyebrows have thinned out, or they need more definition, try using an eyebrow powder that is 2 shades lighter than your hair colour. Use an angled brush to apply the powder to your brows until they’re at the thickness you like.If you have white or grey hair, choose taupe instead of a colour to match your hair.
If you’re a redhead and can’t find any eyebrow pencils or powders in the right colour, try using a lip liner or eye shadow instead.

 Since long, straight hair has the same effect as wearing monochromatic colors and vertical stripes—making you look taller—you should choose a look that is layered. Getting a haircut with many long and short layers will distract people from how tall you are.Many waves in your hair can also achieve this effect.
If you have natural waves, use a gel to capture them.
If you have naturally straight hair, use a curling iron, overnight curlers, or hot rollers. You can even use a hair dryer over a rounded brush to create waves.
 If you have long, straight hair that you don’t want to cut, you may want to try putting it up in different ways to create the illusion of layers. You can accomplish this by pulling back only the top layer of hair or pinning up different areas of hair.


You can also try braiding techniques that make your hair look layered., Avoid hairstyles that add inches to your height, like pompadours and styles with a lot of volume. However, volume is ok if it’s below the crown and does not push your hair up above your head.By the same token, avoid messy buns on top of your head.


If you want volume, add a volumizing product to the hair around the sides of your face.

 If you are not clear about the destination, you will wind up some place else and so will those looking to you for direction. Leaders have vision. Make sure your vision is clear and written down.;
, There is no point in doing something extremely well, if it doesn't need to be done at all. Who benefits? What are the consequences of NOT realizing the vision?

, What will it look like when the vision is a reality?

, Use them. Ordinary leaders have accomplished extraordinary things with very little.Work with what you have, where you are, with the time available. Everyone has 24 hrs. a day. Use them in pursuit of the goals that get you where you want to go.
 Nobody can be who you are with your unique history, perspective, and combination of strengths and weaknesses. Be yourself, but be your "best" self. Second rate character leads to second rate results.

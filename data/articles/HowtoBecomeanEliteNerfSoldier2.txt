 To do this, get familiar with your Nerf gun. Start with one first Nerf gun, and learn everything about it, knowing what direction it pulls to. Does it arc higher up or down?

, Use time trials to see how fast you can load, shoot, reload, etc.
 Do both separately first, then try them together, slowly.
 Practice your aim, stealth,shooting while running, and sniping, among other things. You'll be swiftly killed in a Nerf war if you know nothing about defense or shooting, so practice often.
 Unless you're enjoying yourself, it's not worth spending ages perfecting your skills. Inject lots of fun into the training and get to enjoy the feeling of hitting the desired target.
 Start by eating a healthy diet, with lots of vegetables and fruits. Sugars will make you crash and burn within 15 minutes, and you’ll likely to get a headache . Avoid eating too much of them. After you’ve gotten your diet working, concentrate on exercise. When in battle, you may need to sprint or run for a long period of time, such a 10-20 minutes! Practice on a treadmill, and doing as many push-ups and sit-ups and jumping-jacks as possible.
 Begin with jumping over PVC Pipe hurtles, climbing trees, rolling, etc., and progress into walking silently and stealthily. Once mastered, try doing some of these while holding, and, if possible, firing the gun!

, Click the log-in button, and a form will appear asking for your username and password, or for you to log in with Facebook.


Click “Log in with Facebook” if you have your Facebook profile linked to Kickstarter. Otherwise, fill in the boxes with your username and password, and click “Log me in!”

,  Click on it to make a menu appear.
 On the right side of the menu, you will see all of your created projects. Click the one you want to work on, and its project page will appear.
 Near the top of the project page is a line of buttons—“Basics,” “Rewards,” Story,” and the like. One of these is labeled “Account.” Click on the “Account” button, and your account information will be displayed.
 In a blue box below the Amazon Payments information is the Identity Verification information. In the fields provided, enter your name, birthday, and home address. After entering the information, click the blue “Verify Identity” button below the fields.
 The next screen will ask you a series of questions designed to verify your identity. Answer the questions to the best of your ability, clicking on the “Next” button to go to the next question.


When you have answered all of the questions, the text next to “Identity Verification” will change to “Verified as .”
If there are any problems verifying, the system will ask you to upload a copy of your photo ID and a recently taken picture of you to make sure you are who you say you are. If things get really awkward, Kickstarter’s Trust and Safety Team will contact you to help manually verify your identity.
When your identity has been satisfactorily verified, you can then move on to the next stage of building your project.

 This is a two-seam screwball grip; countless other grips can be used to throw the screwball, but this is probably what beginners should start off with. Be sure to hold both index and middle fingers together in your grip.


Put your pointer finger on the seams. This way, it has more traction or grip on the ball, creating a bigger break when you actually throw the pitch.






Grip the baseball so that your two fingers cross the bottom part of the horseshoe. Again, the more traction you create when the baseball leaves your hand, the more likely it is to dip to curve if thrown with the proper mechanics.

, Mimicking the motion of the fastball is important here. You want to disguise your pitch until the last possible second so that the batter doesn't know in advance what kind of a pitch you are throwing.
 The screwball is the reverse-curveball. If thrown by a rightie, it breaks down and away from lefties. To get this kind of spin on the ball, you want to turn your wrist counter-clockwise if you're a right handed pitcher.
 Think of pulling down the ball with your pointer finger as you release it. This should give the ball better curve and slice.
 The screwball may be a devastating pitch to batters, but it's also gained a reputation for being a devastating pitch for pitchers. That's because the wrist action that pitchers need to perform in order to throw it can be difficult to repeat and puts undue stress on the wrist and arm. Pitchers who specialize in the screwball often find that the torque generated by throwing it is uncomfortable, especially after having had surgery.

 Before you can order any type of ring, you must know what you are shopping for.


Cubic zirconia rings are sized on the same scale as any other type of ring. You may find your ring size using a standard sizer, or you may go into any jeweler and have them size your finger for you.
Remember that you have the same style options with CZ as you do with any type of precious stone, so will need to choose between circle, oval, pear, princess and square cuts. Additionally, you may be able to find a CZ ring featuring any of a variety of rarer shapes, such as a heart, star or octagon.
As cubic zirconia rings can be found at a variety of price points, it is also helpful to have a budget in mind before you start shopping.;
, Just as with diamonds, cubic zirconia stones are graded according to carat, color, clarity and cut, on a scale of A to AAAAA ï¿½ A being the lowest and AAAAA being the highest.


Carat is the stone's size, or weight.
Most cubic zirconia stones are white in color (the equivalent of a perfect diamond). Note that colored CZ may have some color irregularities.
Clarity refers to the cloudiness (or lack thereof) of a stone, as well as its flaws. CZ is rarely, if ever, cloudy or flawed. Its perfection is the most give-away indicator that it is not a real diamond.
The cut of a stone determines how it refracts light, and a well-cut, high-quality stone will be cut in a way to provide as much white light ("ice") as possible. Conversely, the more colored-light ("fire") a stone refracts, the lower the quality of the stone.
 Just like diamonds, cubic zirconia stones can be placed in a multitude of settings. You can find setting styles by browsing through any jewelry catalog, or by searching online.



Retail department stores often carry a selection of preset cubic zirconia rings, at relatively inexpensive prices.
Jewelry stores carry higher-grade CZ jewelry, and will even set a loose stone for you in order to create a custom CZ ring.
Wholesalers sell cubic zirconia jewelry, as well as loose stones. An online search will produce a multitude of CZ wholesalers that you can shop with.
 Before you purchase a CZ ring, take the time to compare rings you like from an array of available sources. Take into account style, price and quality when weighing your options.

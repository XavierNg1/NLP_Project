 One of the easiest and quickest ways to keep your hair looking good during a workout is to put it up in a ponytail with hair ties. You may tie your hair up with several hair ties so it is secure when you do an intense workout, such as running, an aerobic class, or interval training. Tying it back and high on your head can keep your hair away from the sweat on your body as you work out.You can also try using bobby pins as well as a hair tie to put your hair in a loose bun on the top of your head so it is out of your face and away from your sweat.;
, You can prevent your hair from getting too wet and frizzy during your workout by wrapping it in a scarf. You may use a cotton scarf to ensure your hair can breath without getting too wet. You can also try using a hair cover designed to protect your hair when you work out.You may look for a hair cover that is designed for use at the gym online or at specialty Black hair stores. These hair covers are often designed to repel moisture and release heat so your hair does not get too wet or frizzy while you exercise.
 You can keep sweat out of your hair by wearing a sweatband when you workout. You may put your hair in an updo with hair ties and then wear a sweatband for extra protection for your hair from your sweat.Look for a sweatband made of absorbent material. Make sure the sweatband sits securely around your head as you do not want it to slip or move while you are working out.

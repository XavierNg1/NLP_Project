 Plan a quick, direct route, the less time you spend in a bad neighborhood the less of a chance that anything can happen to you. Plan a route that can avoid small spaces, dark places or alleys.;
, Think cell phone with full batteries, mace and good shoes for running.
 There is always strength in numbers.
 Wearing clothes that make you look rich might make you a target so think, average Joe when dressing. Remove any bandannas and caps should not be tilted. Do not wear anything that might be associated with a gang. (Try to avoid light blue and red bandannas especially)

, Like you have somewhere to be, DO NOT BE SLOW. Walk with confidence and stride so you blend in. If you look like you belong, no one will notice you. Just act like it is an every day thing.
,, Ignore people, act like you have to be someplace. If someone speaks to you nod and walk away like you are late for something.

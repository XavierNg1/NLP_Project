 You can use face wash, or just soap. After applying face wash/soap, wash it off with a washcloth.
 This only if you have some in the house. To apply astringent, press a cotton ball to the part of the bottle where the astringent comes out. Dab the cotton ball on your face until your face feels clean.
 Only do this step if you wear make-up. Try wearing some sparkly (but not too noticeable) eye shadow, a bit of lip gloss, chapstick or lip balm, some pale pink or red blush, and possibly a bit of mascara on your top eyelash.

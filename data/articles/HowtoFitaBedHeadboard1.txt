 Divan beds are designed as backless, but they often include screw holes for headboards to be added later.Before purchasing a new headboard, check how far apart its struts need to be in order to fit your bed. Check the back of your bed for bolts or screw holes on either side and measure the distance between them.


Larger beds may have more than one hole in a vertical line, but measuring these aren’t necessary. You want the horizontal distance from a hole toward one side of the bed to one that’s level with it toward the other.
This step is not necessary if you plan to mount your headboard to the wall.;
, First, measure from one corner of its head to the other to find out its width. Next, decide if you want the headboard to back any surrounding furniture, such as matching nightstands. If so, measure the distance between the bed and those pieces’ farthest sides. Add those figures to your total width.


Headboards typically project anywhere up to three inches (7.6 cm) past the corner of the bed’s head.If you are backing other furniture as well, apply this rule to their farthest sides from the bed.
 Measure the length of the bed, from its head to its foot. Also measure its height, including the mattress and any toppers. Use these figures to determine how high above the top of your mattress your headboard should rise.Standard headboards stand roughly 14 inches (35.5 cm) higher than the top of the mattress.
Extra tall headboards should be less than the bed’s length.

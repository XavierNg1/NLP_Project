Try for slow, precise kissing throughout the photo shoot.
 A great pose can be a walking pose. You and your partner can walk somewhere together arm-in-arm or holding hands. You can walk in an area that's special to you. For example, try taking a walk through the neighborhood where you first met.You should try to walk slowly to give the photograph a chance to capture your movements.
You can try doing romantic poses when walking. For example, walk hand in hand or link your arms when you walk.
 Try to give the photographer a chance to capture some candid photos. You do not want to look stiff and posed for all your photos. Try interacting as you normally would. Talk, laugh, and snuggle while the camera is on. This way, you will have a few candid photos to choose from when you're done taking engagement photos.Look into each other's eyes while the photos are being taken. This helps the photos look natural.
 You don't always have to pose on a beach or somewhere out in nature. It may be nice to have a few engagement photos of you and your partner simply interacting at home.For example, have the photographer come over and take some photos of the two of you cooking dinner. You can still do romantic things, like kissing, and showcase engagement rings, but you'll be able to choose a few photos that capture aspects of your real life.
You can also try a photo of the two of you curled up on the couch watching television or snuggling.

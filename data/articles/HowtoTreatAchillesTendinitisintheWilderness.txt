 A rolling fashion is where you initially land on your heel, your weight transfers to the front of your foot and your heel lifts up before you swing your leg forward. Lifting your heel up is the crucial technique element to do.;

Make heel cups out of cardboard. Heel cups which are minimal should be the least uncomfortable. You want to elevate your heel, a bit. The cupping of the heel prevents the cardboard underneath from sliding to the front of your shoes.
Have a shoemaker add 1⁄8 or 1⁄4 inch (0.3 or 0.6 cm) to your heel - an easy and inexpensive modification that will also add life to your shoes.
With paper glue make insoles out of cardboard with several layers under the heel and just one layer throughout the insole. A cardboard insole will not last long.

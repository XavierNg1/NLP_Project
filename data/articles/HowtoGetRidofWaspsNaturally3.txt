 Observe the wasps over a period of time to see if where they go into the ground. If the nest has too many entrances and exits, you may need to call an exterminator to remove it.
 Use any generic hand soap or dishwashing soap mixed with water. This process will kill bees currently inside the nest.
 Push the bowl a couple inches into the ground. Make sure that it is completely sealed.
 Remove the bowl carefully. The wasps should have either died from the soapy water or moved to another location because of lack of food.

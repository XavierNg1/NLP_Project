 Either buy an empty spritzer bottle, or empty and rinse out another spray bottle you already have. If you use a bottle that had liquid in it already, make sure it was a mild, non-acidic cleaner. If you use a bottle that has harsh chemicals, some of that may transfer to the floor.;
, Place a funnel in the top of the bottle to make pouring easier. Measure out ¼ teaspoon (1.23 ml) of dish soap and pour it in the bottle. Measure ¼ cup (59 ml) of rubbing alcohol and pour it in. Then add 2 ½ cups (591.5 ml) of water to the bottle., Gently swirl the bottle in a circular motion to to completely combine all of the ingredients. It take less than 30 seconds for the liquids to combine. The dish soap may form suds, but don’t worry about it., Look for spots on the terrazzo that are hazy or dirty and spray the solution liberally. This solution works well for cleaning up terrazzo countertops, or for cleaning small sections of flooring.


Only use this solution on terrazzo that has been sealed with commercial sealer or the moisture will soak into the pores.
If an entire floor needs to be cleaned, opt for steam cleaning rather than using this solution.
 Especially for spots that are particularly dirty, let the solution sit for two or three minutes to give it time to work. If you are in a hurry, wipe it up as quickly as you need to. It’s not necessary to let the cleaner sit for more than a few minutes.
 Use a clean rag when you wipe up the solution. Dampen the rag with hot water and wipe the spot with circular motions. If any spots still appear hazy or dirty, spray them again and let it sit for longer before you wipe it up.

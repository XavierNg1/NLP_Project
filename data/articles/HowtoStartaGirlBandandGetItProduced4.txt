 Don’t feel intimidated by the reality of creating a demo. It’s possible to create demos in DIY sound booths if you have the right padding to line your walls, the right mic, and the right audio equipment.


Another option for creating your demo is to pay for studio time. Some places offer low rates like $35 an hour to use their equipment. Consider that when looking for a place to record.
Sell your finished demo at your shows for profit, place them online on places like Soundcloud and YouTube for exposure, and/or distribute them to labels., Nowadays, sending tracks to labels is as simple as finding the right email and sending over audio files. Send your promo package in a professional way by giving the audio file a sensible name, branding it with your band’s logo, and any additional marketing materials that your band may have.Make sure that the track is easily shareable in the event that a producer or exec likes it and wants to share it.
When you’re sending a demo to labels, make sure that the CD or package you include has 2-3 of your band’s best songs on it.Amongst your marketing materials, there should also be a press release enclosed. Including a press release with the promo package you send to renowned music sites will help them publish a write up about your band more efficiently.
 A manager can rep your band and make the phone calls and reach out to people if necessary. It might be possible to obtain a manager who won’t require a payday until they bring you results.

 Wash about 4 pounds (2 kg) of red potatoes and place them in a 6-quart (5.5 L) slow cooker. Dice and peel four cloves of garlic. Add the diced garlic, ¼ cup (57 g) of butter, and ¼ cup (60 mL) of water to the slow cooker. Cover and cook on high for 3 to 4 hours or on low for 7 to 8 hours., Once the potatoes are soft, add ½-cup (113 g) sour cream, 1/3 cup (30 g) of parmesan cheese, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of milk, ¼ teaspoon (.7 g) of nutmeg, and ½ teaspoon (1.3 g) each of thyme, oregano, basil. Use a potato masher or an electric mixer to blend the potatoes. Add some more milk if the mixture is too thick for your taste.


Add salt and pepper to taste.
You can grate the parmesan yourself or buy grated cheese at the grocery store.
 The garlic mashed potatoes are great for making loaded mashed potatoes. While your potatoes cool, dice up some chives and then sprinkle them on top of the potatoes. If you really want to zest up your potatoes, consider topping them with bacon, cheddar cheese, and a little sour cream.,

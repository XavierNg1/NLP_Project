 Dogs suffer from two main types of epilepsy: primary and secondary. Primary epilepsy tends to strike young dogs (under two years of age) as it is a genetic disorder although it can take until the age of six to manifest.This condition is also known as idiopathic epilepsy. Secondary epilepsy may occur at any age. This type of epilepsy is often due to another problem that affects the neurological system, such as an infection, a disease, a brain injury, a stroke or brain tumor., In a grand mal seizure, the dog falls to its side and becomes rigid while thrashing its limbs. It may howl, salivate, bite, urinate and/or defecate during the seizure, which will last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Keep in mind that not all dogs have grand mal seizures. Some dogs may have less severe or obvious seizures., Some dogs may suffer from seizure that prompt them to move in a strange way or do something repetitive such as licking or walking in a circle. Pay attention to any unusual behavior that your dog displays. If you are unsure if this behavior is a seizure or not, talk to your veterinarian., Prior to a seizure, your dog may sense that something isn't right and begin to react. You may notice your dog doing certain things before a seizure such as:Acting clingy
Pacing
Whining
Vomiting
Looking dazed or confused

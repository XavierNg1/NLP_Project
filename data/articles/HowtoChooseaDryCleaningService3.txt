 Ask general questions about whether your garment(s) need to be dry cleaned, and how often dry cleaning is necessary. If the staff aren't helpful, or cannot answer questions about the particular items you’re interested in having dry cleaned, you should take your business elsewhere.


However, in some cases, even if the staff is less than friendly, you might want to stick with them if they really know their stuff.
You might also inquire how long the business has been in operation. Newer businesses might not have the well-established reputation that a business of long standing does, but this does not mean that the newer business is inferior to the older business.
If the staff takes time to listen attentively to your requests and questions, and looks over individual items with care, the business will likely do a good job with your dry cleaning.
 Take one or two less valuable items in to be dry cleaned. Tablecloths or jackets, for instance, are useful items for demonstrating the level of quality you’ll get from the business. If your items come back stinky, torn, or just plain unclean, try another dry cleaning service.


Don’t use wedding dresses or fancy suits as test items.
 Think about your specific wants and needs when deciding which dry cleaning service to use.For instance, if one dry cleaning service is environmentally friendly but has steeper prices than others that are not environmentally friendly, you will have to decide what the relative importance of cost compared to environmental consciousness is.


Don’t feel locked into a particular dry cleaning service. If you are unsatisfied with one service, try another.

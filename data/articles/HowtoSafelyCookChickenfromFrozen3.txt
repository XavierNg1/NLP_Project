 Because it is difficult to get seasoning to stick to frozen chicken skin, it may be easier to season your drumsticks before freezing them. Before you put them in the freezer, coat your drumsticks with your desired seasoning or rub. This will freeze the seasoning to the skin and make it easier to pull the legs from the freezer and toss them in the oven when you are ready to cook.This is a great way to season any individual pieces of chicken before you freeze them.
 Heat the oven to 350ºF (177ºC). While the oven warms, remove your drumsticks from the freezer and place them on a tray. For a side, you may also want to add some chopped vegetables like carrots and onions or a few sliced potatoes to the tray., Place the tray in the oven and cook the drumsticks for about 50 to 60 minutes. Once the time is up, insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the drumstick to make sure that it is cooked. If the temperature is below 165°F (74°C) or if there is any red or pink meat, put the breasts back in the oven and let them cook until they are white and the juices run clear.When you are taking the temperature of the drumsticks, try not to touch the bone with your thermometer. This will give you an inaccurate temperature.

 Ideally, you should both already be lying down on the floor, a bed, or another soft surface.
 You can do this at the beginning of your tickle fight, or after executing some other tickle tactics. The Triple Tickle is an especially effective warm-up move for the Double-Foot Tickle, because you'll already have your opponent on his back.
 You should be facing the soles of his feet.
 Tighten your grip.
 Take turns between the two feet, and really try to tickle the area in the middle of his foot, which is the most sensitive.
 Your opponent will try to kick his legs and whip his body, so get ready to shift to the right and left as your opponent wildly flails before giving up.


Make sure to keep your face at a distance from your opponent's feet. You want to win a tickle fight, not lose your front tooth.

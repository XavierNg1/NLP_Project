 Some genius discovered that you can use unsweetened drink mix or Jello mix to add flavour and colour to popcorn. The bright, fruity flavours and colours make this recipe perfect for parties. Here's what you'll need:


8 cups of popped popcorn (if you're not popping it from scratch, choose an unflavoured kind)
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup corn syrup
1/2 cup sugar
3.5 oz flavoured, unsweetened gelatin mix or fruit drink mix

, Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper or spraying it with cooking oil, and set it aside.
 Make sure it's big enough so that you'll be able to reach in and mix the popcorn with the flavouring.
 Put all of these ingredients into a small pot and heat them over medium heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to allow it to simmer. Simmer the mixture for 5 minutes.
 Use a long-handled wooden spoon to stir the mixture in with the popcorn, and try to thoroughly incorporate it so every piece gets coated.
 Use the spoon to spread it out in a single layer. Examine the popcorn for unpopped kernels and pick them out.
 This hardens the flavouring so the popcorn becomes crunchy, rather than chewy. If you want it extra crunchy, bake for 15 minutes. If you like your popcorn chewy, take it out after 5 minutes.
 Once it's cool enough to handle, enjoy the popcorn or store it in an airtight container for later.

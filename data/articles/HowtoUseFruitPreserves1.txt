 Place chicken wings in a bag with strawberry preserves or orange marmalade. Use about one cup (237 ml) of preserves for every pound (.45 kg) of chicken wings. Let the bag of wings sit in the refrigerator for a couple of hours. Grill or bake them as you wish.Any type of preserves can be used, based on what you prefer.
Grill the wings for 7-10 minutes on each side. Bake them for roughly 30-60 minutes at 350℉ (177℃). Either way, make sure the internal temp reaches 165℉ (74℃). Check with a meat thermometer.;
, Grab some thawed, raw pork chops, a sharp paring knife, preserves, and a spoon. Slice lengthwise down the side of the chops, opening a pocket inside. Scoop your favorite preserves into the inside of the meat. Bake the pork chops as you normally would, or for about 30 minutes at 365℉ (185℃).Internal temperature for pork is recommended at 145℉ (63℃).
Cherry, apple, fig, or any kind of pepper preserves go well with pork, but don't be afraid to experiment with other preserves.
 Mix together 1 cup jam (240 ml), 1/2 cup (120 ml) chili sauce, 1 tbsp. (14.8 ml) dried chopped onion, and 1 tbsp. (14.8 ml) Worcestershire Sauce in a mixing bowl. Then scoop it over spare ribs, meatballs, chicken breast, pork cutlets, or any other meat. Let the meat soak in the marinade and cook it as you normally would.Lemon, pineapple, and plum preserves work well, but try out different options to find what you like the best.

 Drill holes into the sides and bottom of the bucket. The holes need to be big enough to allow water to flow through, but small enough to ensure that the crabs cannot escape.Alternatively, you can buy a specially designed wooden box to store the crabs in.
This method is ideal if you live near the water where the crabs were caught. If not, use the cooler method to store the crabs.
 Go to your local hardware store and buy wire mesh. Take your mesh and bend it over the top of the five-gallon bucket. Staple the sides of the mesh, that overlap the top of the bucket, to the sides of the bucket.When you buy the mesh, the dimensions should be at least one inch larger than the size of your bucket.
Use a heavy duty staple gun to fasten the mesh to the sides of the bucket.
 If you are storing live blue crabs in the water, you will need to feed them. Adult blue crabs will eat oysters, hard clams, dead or live fish, crabs (including blue crabs), shrimp, organic debris, aquatic plants, and the leaves and shoots of sea lettuce, eelgrass, salt marsh grass, and ditch grass.Feed them once or twice per day.
 Keep the crabs cool and moist in a cooler or bushel basket. The optimal temperature is about 50 degrees fahrenheit. Any temperatures colder than that can kill the crabs.Do not refrigerate them. Because the temperatures in a refrigerator are too cold, refrigeration will kill blue crabs.
 Chilled crabs will be in a dormant state and can appear to be dead. Before cooking, let the crabs warm to room temperature. The crabs will become animated once they are room temperature. This way you can tell which crabs are alive and which crabs are dead.Never cook dead crabs.

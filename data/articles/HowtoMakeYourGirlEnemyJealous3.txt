 Even if you don't you may just look at her profile to see what she post and what caption she uses. If you start to feel jealous, here's what you do.


Put the phone DOWN. Comparing herself to you doesn't help you. It just makes you angry.
Remember social media is a way to make your life seem cool. If she post a picture saying, "In Hawaii AGAINÂ :)" You can post of you doing what seems cool. For example, "When I was in the mountains <3" To show that your life is pretty cool too.



Write down what you're feeling on a piece of paper, and rip it up.
Try to block her out.



Find something else to do.
Always know not to let anger rule your life. Do other things and live a little. Forget her. You have other friends that care about you more than you realize.
Keep your head high. You're your own original!

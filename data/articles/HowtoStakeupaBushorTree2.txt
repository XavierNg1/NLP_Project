 A single stake method works best with a bare root tree, or a tree that was dug out of the ground when leafless and that had all of its soil shaken from its roots. Select a bamboo or wooden stake for small and medium sized trees or if you’ve got a larger tree on your hands, use a metal stake.Select an angled stake if you’re concerned about letting your tree have room to flex and build up its own strength.
Select a tall, straight stake if your tree is top heavy., Dig a hole 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) deep about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the base of the primary branch on the windward side of the tree, or the side with the prevailing wind. If planted on this side, your tree will pull away from the stake instead of rubbing against it.If you’re doing preventive staking, place your stake in the ground before you plant your tree. This will prevent damage to the roots of your tree if you accidentally hammer your stake into them., Once your tree has been planted, look for the primary branch that supports the most growth. This is typically near the center, but if you have a tree that has split down the center, there may be 2 primary branches.
 Using a material with a flat, broad surface, such as elastic or a cord inside of a rubber hose, tie the branch to several locations on the stake for firm support. You should use a figure eight loop to tie the branch to the stake in order to prevent the stake rubbing up against the stem.Take care not to use a tie that is a bare cord or wire as these will cut into the tree and damage it.
 After one growing season your tree’s root system should’ve spread out enough to fully support the tree without additional help from stakes. Remove the stakes and save them to reuse on another tree or bush.


You could always leave the stakes in place after removing the ties. Then you’ll have a barrier to protect the tree from lawn mowers.

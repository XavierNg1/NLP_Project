 If you’ve found someone you’re seriously interested in, don’t be afraid to make the first move. Most girls really appreciate it when you take the initiative to ask them out (even if they don’t say yes). On top of that, you will feel proud of yourself for having been so bold (again, even if they don’t say yes). Read How to Ask a Girl Out to give yourself every advantage.


Many are the tales of the gorgeous girl who never got asked out because everybody was so sure that she was either already busy or too beautiful for them, that they never asked.
Be persistent. If a girl you’re really interested in doesn’t say yes the first time, try again later. This doesn’t mean being clingy or acting like a stalker; it means smiling, saying, “Alright—I’ll try again next week,” and going about your own business for a while. If you normally talk to her during the week, don't stop. Just don't pressure the date request.
Give her some time to think about how cool and confident you were and the next time you ask, you might be surprised by how differently she responds.
 Okay, so you finally snagged the girl you were dreaming of. Now what do you do with her?


If you’re at the kissing stage, make sure you are ready—clean, fresh breath, all of that.
If you’re at the relationship stage, make sure you know how to be a good boyfriend.
If things get serious, make sure you know how to have a healthy relationship.
Going through the trouble of making a girl crazy about you only to let her down when things get interesting is enough to make a girl plain crazy!

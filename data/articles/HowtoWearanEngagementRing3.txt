 A lost, stolen, or damaged ring is a nightmare, but that doesn’t mean it’s a problem that can’t be solved. Your partner may have already gotten insurance. If not, this is an important first step after receiving your ring. Many companies will allow you to add the insurance for the ring to your homeowners or renters insurance., You might never want to take off your ring, but the time will probably come when you have to. Designate a place to store your ring safely. This will take the stress away from frantically trying to remember where you put it last. Keep a ring box in your bedroom, and a ring dish in the kitchen.Make sure the ring dish is kept far away from the drain.
 This isn’t necessary, but it can be a good idea when leaving for a trip where you will be moving around a lot. Moving from place to place, especially when going to the beach, may result in a lost ring in the whirlwind of the fun (or business). Consider going without a ring or wearing an inexpensive ring during the trip.The ring can also be damaged when lifting bags or using bags that roll.

 You'll stay crouched as long as you hold the key. This key is the same for all computer versions of Minecraft.;
, While you can't toggle it by default, there are some workarounds you can use to turn the crouch into a toggle instead of having to hold the key:


Windows - Hold ⇧ Shift, then hold Alt. The game will freeze momentarily. Release both keys, then press Alt again. The game will unfreeze, and you'll be locked into sneaking. Press ⇧ Shift again to return to normal.Mac - Change the Sneak command to ⇬ Caps Lock. This turns Sneak into a toggle instead of having to hold it.

 Blue cheese should be refrigerated to keep it fresh, so if you leave it out on your counter, it’s going to spoil more quickly. In most cases, you’ll notice that it’s gone bad after just a few days. If you’re accidentally left blue cheese out, it’s best to throw it away if it’s been two days or more., When blue cheese is kept in the refrigerator, it can last quite a while. Check the expiration date on your cheese -- in most cases, it will remain good for one to two weeks past the date. That typically means it will last in fridge for three to four weeks.To keep your blue cheese fresh as long as possible, make sure your refrigerator temperature isn’t set above 40 degrees.
 If blue cheese is kept in the freezer at 0 degrees, it can last indefinitely, which means you can freeze excess cheese that you don’t plan on using within the month to prevent it from spoiling. However, for best taste and texture, you shouldn’t keep it frozen for more than half a year.Keep in mind that the taste and texture of blue cheese can change slightly when it’s thawed. It loses some of its sharp flavor and usually crumbles more easily.

, Place the chopped yams in a roasting tray and toss them with oil, salt and pepper to thoroughly coat.
 Place a saucepan over a medium-high heat. Add the sugar, water, lemon juice, sherry, vanilla and maple syrup. Bring to a boil and simmer for 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside until the yams are done.
 Keep checking on the yams, making sure that they do not burn on the bottom by turning them over occasionally. At around 20-25 minutes, test them with a knife to see if they are cooked. The knife should enter easily without resistance. At this point, transfer them to the oven-proof dish.
 Pour the syrup over the sweet potatoes and return them to the oven. Let them warm through, giving the syrup time to caramelize. This should take about 25 minutes. Finally, remove from the oven.
 Your yams are almost ready for the table. All that is left is to sprinkle them with some toasted almonds. They will go well with turkey or ham.

 The pot should be large enough to fit all the hot dogs you want to boil. Leave a few inches of room at the top of the pot so it won't boil over when you add the dogs.;
, Carefully slip them into the pot one by one. Don't toss them in all at once, or the boiling water could splash you.
 Hot dogs come pre-cooked, but they taste best when they're heated thorough. Boiling them for six minutes is enough time to get the hot dogs piping hot, but it's short enough to keep them from splitting down the middle. You want to avoid letting the hot dogs split, since they'll lose a lot of flavor if they do.


If you're boiling a large pack of hot dogs, they may need an extra minute or two. Test a dog to see if it's ready before removing the rest of them from heat.
If you're boiling just a dog or two, they may be ready before six minutes are up. Test a dog at five minutes to see if it's hot enough to suit you. If not, put it back in the water.
 You can remove them one by one with tongs, shaking off the water as you go. As an alternative, pour the entire pot of dogs through a strainer, so that the water runs through and the dogs are caught.If you made enough hot dogs for people to come back for seconds, leave the extra dogs in the pot of warm water. Just move it to a cool burner and put a lid on the pot; the extra dogs are still likely to be hot when you're ready to eat them.
If you're serving a big crowd and you want to keep a lot of hot dogs warm, keep the burner on the lowest heat setting until all the hot dogs are gone.

 Which is good; if you want to be unique, different, and stand out from the crowd, this is an easy way to do it.;
, Plats work well for people who are a bit on the short side. They give you a bit of extra height that's easy to walk in (compared to high heels with thin soles). Also, people who tend to be a bit on the "chunky" side, with shorter legs or a longish torso, will benefit from the look. Thin, slender, or tall people should avoid platforms.
 Buy quality plats; cheap vinyl and plastic plats fall apart quickly and end up looking ratty. For everyday wear, no more than a two inch platform and a four inch heel is probably the maximum for comfort. Wear flare leg pants or jeans that complement your shoes or boots.
 Keep things moderate; no extreme plats for everyday wear.
 Sure, you could try to wear some platform boots with metallic silver striping or red flame patterns, but the basic platform style is wild enough. Black or brown color, with minimal accents, patterns, buckles, etc. will work much better at creating a look that is different, but still tasteful.

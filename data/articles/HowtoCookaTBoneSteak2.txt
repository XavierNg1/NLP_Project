 Heat two tablespoons of olive or vegetable oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. If possible, use a cast-iron skillet or other heavy frying pan., Using tongs or a spatula, sear each side of the steak, occasionally moving it to ensure it doesn't stick to the pan. Hold the steak up vertically in the pan to sear the edges. Sear for about 5-6 minutes for rare, 6-7 minutes for medium rare, and 7-8 minutes for medium.
 Remove the steak from the pan if it is charred to your liking. Wrap it in aluminum foil and allow it to sit for 5-10 minutes, as this allows the flavors to mix and settle. Serve whole or sliced.

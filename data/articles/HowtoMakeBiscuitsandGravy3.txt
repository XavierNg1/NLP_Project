 Meanwhile, prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil.
 Mix the baking mix and water together in a medium mixing bowl until the dough forms a ball.


You can use your hands to mix the ingredients or you can use a wooden or plastic mixing spoon. If you use your hands, make sure to wash and dry them thoroughly before you touch the dough.
 Use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of dough per biscuit.


Place the biscuits 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) apart from one another to give them space to expand as they bake.
 Cook the biscuits in your preheated oven until they turn golden-brown.


Remove from the oven when done and let them cool to the touch before handling.
 You can place the finished biscuits on a large serving platter or on individual serving dishes.


Serve the biscuits with warm shortcut gravy.

,, You may want to add and change such things as:


The blade
The 'hand guard'
The handle
The hilt
Any other parts of the sword you wish to modify or add

, This is not a game drawing, so color however you want! You may wish to use similar colors to the default swords but go with any design you desire! However, if you want it to still look 'Minecraft-y' it's better to go with default colors.
 You can draw a shadow of the sword floating in midair and try different angles of light.
 You may also like to add a themed background to the image

, If you have some more time and patience you can try to shade the bottom and top of the shapes with different shades. For each colored shape in the add more black and/or less saturation to the color, and color a rounded shape in the bottom corners; vice versa shades for the top corners.
 For a very small but effective final touch you may like to add a little reflection 'glint'. They can be as simple or as advanced as you want from an easy 5 point star to a complicated pointed shape.

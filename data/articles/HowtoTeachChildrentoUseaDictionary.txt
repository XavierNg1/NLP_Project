 It is difficult for children to learn straight out of you favorite full-size Merriam Webster dictionary, so make sure you have a children's dictionary. It is best if the dictionary has pictures, color, clearly labeled headings, and an easy to read font.;
, Find a book that is slightly above their reading level, and ask them to read it to you. When they stumble on a word the don't know, ask them what they think the meaning is. If they say 'I don't know', help them to use context clues first. If they still cannot work it out, then get the dictionary.
 Depending on the age of the child, say something like "This is a dictionary. It is a helpful book we can use when we don't know the meaning of a word or we don't know how to spell something."

, When they start to get bored of this, go back to the unfamiliar word and ask if they think the dictionary can help them to find out what it means. Encourage them to say yes.
 Ask them what letter their word begins with, and then help them to find that letter in the dictionary. Then explain that you have to find the second letter of the word, and so on.


For example, if their word was reptile, help them find the letter r. Then tell them to find the 're' section. Keep doing this ('rep', 'rept', etc.) until they find the word.
 Now they know what the word means. Go back to the book, and keep reading, until you have found three words they need to look up. Do this everyday and they will soon be able to use a dictionary by themselves.

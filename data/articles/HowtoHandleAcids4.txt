 If you should be exposed to acids, the very first thing you should do is proceed to the emergency showers (if your body was exposed) or the eyewash station (if the acid made contact with your eyes). Flush the contacted area with water for at least 15 minutes.
 If your body and clothing have been exposed to acid, remove any and all contaminated clothing while you are in the emergency shower. You can dispose of this contaminated apparel later.
 If the spill contains hydrofluoric acid (HF) and it has made contact with your skin, you will need to apply a calcium gluconate gel right away. This will help to neutralize the hydrofluoric acid, stop the burn, and provide you with some relief., Very quickly, you will need to decide if this is a spill that can be handled by the laboratory staff, or one that requires immediate, large-scale evacuation. This will vary slightly by the capacity of your laboratory and staff. Make sure you understand what types of spills fall under which category. When an emergency occurs, quickly decide what needs to be done.
 In the event of an acid spill, the laboratory will need to be evacuated. In some severe cases, you may need to evacuate the whole building. After the most acute injuries have been addressed, make sure that everyone is removed from the area.


If you are on a university campus, you should also notify campus police.
 Depending on the severity of your injuries, it may be necessary to seek medical attention. If you have sustained burns, injuries to the eyes, of have inhaled acid fumes, it is a good idea to visit your local doctor or hospital.

 For a spicier, more complex flavor, use Mexican chocolate ice cream from a Latin market, melt a few squares of Mexican chocolate and blend it into the shake, or use the ordinary recipe with the following added ingredients:


⅛ tsp (1 pinch) ground cinnamon
⅛ tsp (1 pinch) ground chiles
⅛ tsp (1 drop) vanilla extract

, Even if you aren't a coffee fan, a pinch of espresso powder will make the shake earthier and toastier. For a stronger mocha blast, blend in 2–3 teaspoons (10–15 mL) of the espresso powder instead.This pairs well with ½ teaspoon (2.5 mL) almond extract.
 Freeze a banana, a couple strawberries, or a handful of raspberries. Slice the frozen fruit into small chunks, then blend for a few seconds to mix the flavors together.
 Enter special dessert territory with these solid ingredients. For best results, add after the shake is blended. Leave them on top of the shake or pulse for a few seconds to mix slightly without compromising the texture. Here are a few ideas:


Roughly crush one or two chocolate cookie or a small brownie into several pieces.
Add toasted marshmallows, or even an entire small s'more.Purchase or make miniature donuts. Keep them mostly dry by placing them around a large straw., A bit of bourbon, Bailey's, Kahlua, or your favorite liqueur adds a whole new dimension of indulgence. Blend in one shot (3 tablespoons / 45 mL) or to taste.


You may wish to replace some of the milk to avoid thinning the milkshake.

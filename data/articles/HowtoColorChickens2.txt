 It's possible to inject dye into chicken eggs during the incubation period, to help distinguish one group of chicks from another after hatching.


This process is completely safe if done correctly, but can harm or kill the chick if done incorrectly or at the wrong time.
The safest time to inject the chicken embryos with dye is between the 11th and 14th day of incubation, though it can be done as early as the 10th and as late as the 19th.
 To inject the chicken egg, you will need a 2 or 3% solution of simple, vegetable-based food coloring.


Any color can be used to dye the embryos, though blue, green and red tend to work best, especially on naturally white chickens.
You will also need a hypodermic needle to inject the dye with.
 Remove the eggs from the incubator and rub the small ends with a 95% alcohol solution to disinfect them, then allow them to dry.


Use a 22 to 27 gauge needle to inject between 0.2 and 0.5 cc of your chosen needle into the egg, approximately one-half inch from the small end of the egg.
Insert the needle just below the inner shell membrane and inject the dye slowly and carefully to avoid overflowing and to prevent it from harming the embryo.
 After you have removed the needle, cover up the hole with a drop of melted paraffin wax to protect the embryo from infection. Return the eggs to the incubator, where they should continue to develop and hatch as normal.

 Just remember to smile and look like you know what you're doing, even if you don't. When you're learning the dance try to be in front, so that you're seeing the choreographer doing the moves - not the person in front of you. If you make a mistake during your dance, don't make a big deal about it. Just keep going and act like it was part of the dance. Also, try not to look at the people dancing around you if you're auditioning in a group because it makes you seem like you don't know what you're doing. It's okay if not every move is perfect - just look like you're having fun!

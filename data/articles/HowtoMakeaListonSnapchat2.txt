 This is the yellow icon with a white ghost.
 Enter your username and password and tap Log in.
 This will open the Snapchat settings menu.


You can also tap the ghost icon at the top left corner of this page to access the settings menu.
 This will bring up a list of your contacts.
, This will be in the in the top right corner of the window that appears.
, Snapchat organizes contacts alphabetically. Doing this will move this contact to the top of your contact list.You can also place an emoji after a contact's name so they stand out or place letter groups such as "zz" or numbers in front of unwanted contacts (this will send them to the bottom of the list if you don't want to delete them).
When renaming contacts, make sure you retain your friends' original names in some way so you can recognize them.
 Now when sending a snap, those with the modified names will all be listed at the top for easy access.


Repeat as necessary for other friends.

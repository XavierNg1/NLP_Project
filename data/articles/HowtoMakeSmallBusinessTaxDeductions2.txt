 It is a good idea to enter each category of expense in a separate section of your tax diary for easy calculations. The following are categories that are often computed and deducted on small business taxes:


Deduct all employee payments. These can be part-time, full-time or contract employees. Employee payments are deductible as necessary business expenses.
Deduct the cost of an office and office expenses. Included in this is rent, mortgage payments, repairs, equipment, furniture, software, professional publications, utilities, supplies and more. Even if you have a home office, as long as you have a dedicated space from which you do business, you will be able to deduct the cost of rent.
Deduct professional and legal expenses. You should also include dues to professional organizations and organization dues.
Deduct advertising expenses. This may also include travel to get new business, business gifts, websites, ads and more.
Deduct the cost of goods sold. For many businesses, this is the cost of the inventory, either made or bought.
Deduct insurance premiums. For self-employed people, this can include health insurance premiums, as long as they are paid individually and not available through a spouse. For small businesses, you can deduct liability and worker's compensation insurance.
Deduct transportation expenses. You can choose to deduct the cost of a vehicle for a business, or you can deduct mileage based on that year's tax formula, such as $.50 per mile.
Deduct bad debts, interest on loans, charity contributions, education and training, depreciation, capital expenses, theft and anything else that was a reasonable expense and is listed in the tax deductions booklet.

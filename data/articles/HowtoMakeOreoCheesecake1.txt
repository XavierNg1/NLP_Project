 If you are using a dark, nonstick pan, lower the oven temperature to 325°F (162°C)., Pulse the Oreo cookies in the food processor until you get fine crumbs first. Add the melted butter and blend again until smooth.

The cookies need to be finely ground, sort of like coffee grounds. If they are too chunky, your crust won't hold together well.
Save the remaining 10 cookies for the filling.
 Make sure that the crust is firmly packed into the pan, or it won't hold together.For a fancier touch, spread the mixture across the bottom of the pan first, then push it 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) up the sides., It won't hold together until you add the cheesecake filling., You can do this using an electric mixer or a food processor fitted with whisks. From time to time, pause the mixer, and scrape down the sides with a spatula; this will ensure that everything gets evenly mixed together.
 Mix the filling on low speed after each egg you add until it is blended before adding the next egg., Make sure that the ingredients are evenly mixed throughout. There should be no streaks and swirls; everything should be consistent.
 Use a knife to chop the cookies into coarse crumbs; they can be as big or as small as you'd like. Gently stir them into the filling using a spatula.
 If you need to, use a spatula to help guide the filling into the crust. Smooth the top down with a spatula so that there aren't any ripples.
 The cake is ready when the center is almost set. To prevent the top of the cake from browning in the oven, tent a sheet of tin foil over the pan during the last 15 to 20 minutes of baking., Once the cheesecake finishes baking, take it out of the oven and set it down. Run a knife around the rim of the pan. Let the cake cool completely before opening the pan and removing the rim. Leave the cake on the pan's base, however., There is enough cake to cut 16 slices. Cover and store any leftovers in the fridge for up to 3 days.To learn how to decorate your cake, click here.

 Fill with just enough water to cover the embroidery.


Use pure soap only as this doesn't have any harsh elements that will harm the embroidery.
Ensure that the container used for cleaning is absolutely spotless.;
, Avoid rubbing or catching threads; simply agitate gently to allow the soap and water to do the work.
 Remove all traces of soap from the embroidery. Dip in a tub or container of cold, clean water, just enough to cover. Agitate gently. This may need to be repeated.


Avoid wringing an embroidery. Wringing, pulling or folding can harm the design. Many embroidered fabrics are simply not designed to withstand being wrung out.
, This gentle pressure will remove excess moisture from it.
 Lay the embroidery flat on a clean white towel. Hold a steam iron just above (do not press directly it on) the embroidered parts and gently release the steam.


Only directly press the fabric around the embroidered parts; this may prove difficult though, so alternatively, you can cover with a thin towel before placing a gently heated iron onto the embroidery directly. Never use a hot iron!

, Keep it as square as possible and pin it out. The ironing board is a good place to pin it to.
 It is now ready for framing or using in the manner intended.

 Like the previous method, you start by turning the tomato on its side. Your cutting the tomato in half, but through the side rather than down the top. You'll end up with the top of the tomato being one half and the bottom of the tomato being the other half., Once again, you need to pull the tomato apart to reveal the center and the seeds. While you'll see a division among the seeds, you probably won't be able to keep as much of the flesh with this method. However, it's a quick method to remove seeds., Over a strainer and a bowl, squeeze the seeds out of the tomato. Simply hold the tomato with the skin in your hand and the cut side over the bowl. As you squeeze, you'll release much of the seeds in the middle. You may smash the tomatoes up a bit with this method, so if you want a pretty presentation, try another method.

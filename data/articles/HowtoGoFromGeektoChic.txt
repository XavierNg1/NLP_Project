 Do not switch to contacts if it will hinder your ability too see. There are some classic, modern glasses that won't make you look geeky.;
, Don't forget curly or wavy hair is very sexy too. Just make sure it looks clean and healthy. Frizzy hair is a complete turn off. You might want to try some highlights too to add a little spice to it if you are feeling a little brave.
 Use a fragrance or body spray to smell good. Never forget deodorant and an antiperspirant (a deodorant without an antiperspirant is not particularly effective because wetness promotes the growth of germs, which produce body odor).
 You may already have all of them at home. Remember you do not have to wear a lot of make up to look sexy. A simple pink shade of gloss, eye liner and blush will do the job. It's up to you. For a more dramatic look try colorful eye shadow or mascara.
 Make sure your clothes fit right. Avoid overly baggy clothes. It does no justice to your figure. High heels, rompers, stylish blouses with playful prints, miniskirts, skinny jeans, or fitting jeans. Show off a little leg or just a little cleavage. Pick out your fave feature on your body and accentuate it. Have a little fun, though don't go overboard and look like you are trying too hard. You want to go from geek to chic, not Geek.

Be careful with this step though, each school has a different "popular" style.
 You are ready to go to school or do whatever you were planning to do.
, Practice in front of the mirror if needed. Be confident. Confident attracts guys like a magnet.

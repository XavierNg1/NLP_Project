 Do you want the whole plant?, the bloom?, the reproductive parts? Knowing what you hope to capture will help you decide on aperture (depth of field), light and speed.

If you want to blur the background and only show the bloom or part of the bloom, use a wide open aperture (F1.4 or as low as the camera goes).
For the whole flower to be clear, use a larger aperture (F11 or higher).
 Will the photograph be of a cut lily or the live plant? A cut lily could be put in a light box, where it would be easier to set up the photographs. If live, take care how you work the plant and manipulate it. Notice here how delicate the stem is.
 Yes, you could shoot handheld, but if you want the picture to be 'tack sharp', use a tripod (or use a super fast shutter speed).

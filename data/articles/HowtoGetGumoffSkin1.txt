 You can buy Vaseline at your local pharmacy. If necessary you can choose a different off brand version of Vaseline if you’re looking to save a little money. Any type of petroleum jelly or Vaseline type substance has the same jelly that adheres to the gum and causes it to loose its stickiness. It becomes smooth and hard and will fall off your skin much more easily.


You can buy the smallest size possible if you don’t use it very often, because you won’t need very much to get the gum off your skin.;
, Rub Vaseline around where the gum is attached to your skin and on the gum itself. You probably only need a nickel sized amount of Vaseline. Feel free to use more if you think it will help, but there is no need to overdo it.
 When you put Vaseline on the gum it will naturally ball up and come off. However, you might need to wait a minute or so for this process to completely take effect.


Don’t try to pull it off immediately after you put the Vaseline on – let the Vaseline soak into the gum and your skin first.

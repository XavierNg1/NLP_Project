 This phrase translates into “good morning” or “good day.”



Buon is derived from the Italian adjective "buono," meaning "good."

Giorno is an Italian noun meaning "day."
As with many other Italian greetings, buongiorno can also mean "good-bye" depending on the context.

Buongiorno and other time-based greetings are considered the most formal way of greeting someone. That said, you can still use these phrases among friends and family.
Pronounce buongiorno as bwohn jor-noh.,


Note that you may still hear buongiorno in the afternoon, but buon pomeriggio is slightly more common and more accurate. "Buon pomeriggio" is a lot more formal than "buongiorno".

Buon means “good” and pomeriggio is a noun meaning “afternoon.”
Pronounce the greeting as bwohn poh-meh-ree-joh.
 After roughly 4 PM, the polite way to greet or bid farewell to someone is with buonasera.



Buona means "good" while sera is an Italian noun meaning "evening." Since sera is feminine, the masculine adjective "buon" takes on the feminine form "buona."
Pronounce buonasera as bwoh-nah seh-rah.

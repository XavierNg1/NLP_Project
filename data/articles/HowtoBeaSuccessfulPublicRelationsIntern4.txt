 How? Meet as many people as possible. You never know what connections someone could have. One smile, handshake, and conversation with a certain person could be the start of your career. It’s all about how you deliver yourself.
 Just because you’re the guinea pig of the company, never let your chin down. Deliver yourself in a way that just screams, “Hire me! I want this!”

, Example: Don’t say you know how to create a spreadsheet if you really don’t.
 Even though the above statement says to always have confidence, don’t be overconfident. Once again, you’re not the professional just yet. Getting too involved and giving your opinion 24/7 can sometimes give you a bad reputation.
, If there’s a deadline for a certain assignment, have it done on time. If you’re unsure about a specific task you’ve been assigned, don’t act like you know what you’re doing. You never want to promise someone high quality work if you’re just going to give them squat! Ask questions!

, Be open for ANYTHING. There’s no such thing as too much experience. Get whatever you can under your belt in the work place; it will come in handy someday!

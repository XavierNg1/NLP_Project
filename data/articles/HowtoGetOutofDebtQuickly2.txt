 Take up a part-time job at a restaurant or bar nearby or look for a seasonal position in retail for the holiday season. You can then take the earnings from your part-time job and put that money towards your debts., Maybe you love to knit and spend your downtime knitting scarves and hats in front of the TV, or maybe you have writing and editing skills that you can apply to contract editing jobs. Work your hobbies or skills and try to make money off of them, either on your own through sales to friends and co-workers or through a contracting site that links you to freelance jobs and opportunities., Ask your boss or supervisor if the company needs someone to pick up extra shifts or hours, or if you can cover for someone else and pick up their extra hours. Increasing your pay check every month will allow you to put down more money on your debts., Approach your boss about the possibility of a raise, especially if you have been working in the same position or department for some time and have high employee performance reviews. Talk to your supervisor about increasing your hourly wage, reiterating that you are a model employee who works hard and is loyal to the company.

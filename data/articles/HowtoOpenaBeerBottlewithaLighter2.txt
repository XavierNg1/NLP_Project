 Keep it low and out of the way, but make sure you have a nice, firm grip on the bottle so it doesn't slide off. Your dominant hand will hold the lighter, using the thumb to grip the top of the bottle, as you pry the cap off.
 You want to have the lighter firmly in your hand, with a bit of the lighter's bottom poking out of the thumb side of your first.


The lighter will be in line with the point of your middle knuckles. In other words, the long side of the lighter bottom will be parallel with your thumb.
 It should be just under the cap, providing pressure to keep the bottle in place as you pop off the cap. The lighter will be on the opposite side of the bottle as your thumb.









If you're right handed, your hand will look a bit like a backwards, lowercase "e." The curve at the bottom is your thumb, the hole in the top is the lighter in your fingers. The bottle will fit in between, in the curve between your thumb and finger.
 This bottom edge will be dug underneath the grooves of the cap and used to push the cap up and off the bottle.









Do not use the rounded corner edge, as this is a smaller surface that can slip easily.
 Think of rotating your fist up and away from the bottle. Your lower hand should hold the bottle down as you push up on the cap with the of the lighter. Turning your wrist away from the bottle, while leaving your thumb on the other side, will create the torque needed to pop the cap off.

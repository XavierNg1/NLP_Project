 Inspect every instrument as you sort to make sure it's clean. Arrange the instruments based on what they're used for and where they need to end up. Keeping them organized is essential because each instrument has a purpose. Make sure you know what your instruments are going to be used for next before you sort them.


Organize and wrap the instruments for distribution before the autoclaving process. If you wait until afterwards and open them, they won't be sterile.
 Once you have your instruments sorted, you need to place them in sterilized pouches that can go into the autoclave. You should use special autoclave pouches designed to withstand the high temperatures of the autoclaves. The pouches have a strip of test tape that changes color when the autoclave process is effective. Take each pile of instruments you sorted and place them in as many bags as necessary.


You shouldn't have too many in a bag because it might hinder the sterilization process. Make sure that any instrument that can open, such as scissors, is left open when you put it into a pouch. The inside of the instruments need to be sterilized as well.Autoclaving in pouches is convenient because you can see the instruments you need when finished., Once you have them locked in a pouch, you need to label each one so you and others will know what the instruments are needed for. Write the instrument names, the date, and your initials on the pouches. Seal each bag securely. If the bag doesn't already have a test strip, attach one. This will show whether the sterilization was successful. You can now place the pouches in the autoclave.

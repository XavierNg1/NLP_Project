 During the treatment, an intense laser light penetrates the epidermis and causes the skin to rejuvenate. The intensity of the light scatters the skin pigments and destroys the discoloration.


The laser treatment is not painful, but may cause minimal discomfort. An anesthetic cream is applied 30 to 45 minutes before the procedure to ease the discomfort.
The number of sessions required will depend on the size of the area and number of spots to be treated. Generally, 2 to 3 sessions will be required. Each session can last from 30 to 45 minutes.
The treatment requires no downtime, but redness, puffiness and sensitivity to sunlight may occur.
Although laser treatment is extremely effective, its major downside is the cost. Depending on the type of laser used (Q-switched ruby, alexandrite or Fraxel dual laser) and the number of age spots requiring treatment, prices can range from $400 to $1500 per session., Microdermabrasion is a noninvasive skin treatment that uses a wand with air pressure. The wand blasts crystals, zinc or other abrasive materials directly against the skin, exfoliating the top layers to remove the dark, hyperpigmented skin.


Microdermabrasion requires no down time and there are no side effects.
A session can be from 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the area being treated. Treatment sessions are given in 2- to 3-week intervals.
Typically, 2 to 3 sessions will be required. Prices range can be $75 or more per session.
 A chemical peel works by dissolving dead skin so new radiant skin will surface. During a chemical peel, the area to be treated is thoroughly cleansed and a gel-like acidic substance is applied. The area is then neutralized to stop the chemical process.


Side effects include redness, peeling and sensitivity, which may require down time.
Generally, two treatment sessions are required, which are given in 3- to 4-week intervals. The prices can be $250 or more per session.

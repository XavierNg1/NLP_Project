 Start at home with older brothers and sisters, then ask grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, friends, and so forth. Specific requests, asked nicely, can sometimes yield great results.


You may be doing them a favor--sometimes people have quite a stash of items that are too good to get rid of, but also do not want to just throw out.
Also consider people who have access to get items inexpensively. Maybe your cousin who works at a store has a 20% employee discount, and would be happy to help you get a great price on items there.



Check your local Freecycle.org website for items people are giving away for free. You can also make requests, if necessary.
Craigslist.org is also a site in which people in a local area sell items (typically inexpensively) or even for free.
Also check websites which are community-based. For instance, in Vermont, USA there is frontporchforum.com, which has bulletin postings based on one's town.
 Paper, envelopes, 3-ring binders, folders, and more can be re-used without having to buy new.


Warning: never take stationery or other office supplies from work without asking, though, or you could lose your job for stealing.
Usually offices are happy to no have to throw away office supplies, and may even qualify for a tax write-off.
 Businesses will often have free notepads, pens, pencils, sticky notes, and water bottles at various events or in-store. Although you are unlikely to get "big ticket" items this way, these items are free!

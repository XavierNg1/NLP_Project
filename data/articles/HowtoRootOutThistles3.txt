 When you see the plants growing starting early spring and seedlings popping up mow the plant to the ground. If this continued over the years the repeated mowing will wear the plant out as thistles are not really long lived plants. Throw these clippings into the trash not into your compost because roots and pieces of plant along with seeds can sprout to new thistle plants.
 If you leave pieces of broken roots of Canada Thistle or break the runners or rhizomes which are creeping roots near the surface these will grow into new plants! If you are digging Canada Thistles roots pick up all the pieces thoroughly. Don't put these pieces of root into compost.
 Read the label to make sure the herbicide is approved for this species. If you are treating an entire area for a new garden you can use what is called an all green killer. If you are getting a weed out of a garden with desired plants use precautions making sure to get a special weed killer that doesn't kill the desired plants or keep the pesticides from drifting onto neighboring plants.
 This is a good idea if you are into organic gardening, your weeds are in a vegetable garden, you have kids or pets or you or someone in the home is allergic to pesticides.


Orellia ruficauda feeds on Canada thistle and has been reported to be the most effective biological control agent for that plant.Its larvae parasitize the seed heads, feeding solely upon fertile seed heads.
The rust species Puccinia obtegens and Puccinia punctiformis are fungi that kill thistle plants.
Aceria anthocoptes a microscopic mite also eats and kills Canada thistle.
The other perennial species are controlled in the same way and are easier because they are not so vigourous as Canada Thistle. Use similar procedures listed for the Canada thistle.

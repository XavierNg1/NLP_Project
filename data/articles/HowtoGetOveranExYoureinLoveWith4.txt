 If you do this, it will be very hard to move on. It is okay to do this for the first few weeks. But after that, pick yourself up and realise that there is more to life than this relationship you had.
 Easier said than done, but don’t feel sorry for yourself. Don’t wallow in your misery. Get on with it.
 You may be feeling angry at this point, but don't give into it.
 Be happy for them, let the new guy/girl have a chance, don’t try to ruin the relationship for them. Know that, yes, your ex will probably act with them how they used to act with you. This will hurt, but accept it.
 Don’t get off with someone right in front of your ex, solely for the purpose of making them jealous. It will be obvious.
 They helped for a while, but start listening to happier music at the moment.

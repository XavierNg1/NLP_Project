 Try this method only if you want to eradicate weeds in an area where you do not plan to grow anything for several years -- perhaps around paving stones and in pavement cracks. Salt kills the weeds and absorbs into the ground, preventing all plant growth. You can apply salt in one of two ways:


Dissolve 1/2 cup (120 ml) salt into enough warm or hot water to fill your spray bottle. Any type of salt should work. Some people recommend common table salt; others suggest using rock salt.
Apply the salt dry. Instead of dissolving the salt into water, you could apply the water and the salt to the weeds at the same time. Hose the weeds well leaving them wet, liberally sprinkle them with salt, and then soak them with water again.
 Dump a large pot-full on them if there are no other plants close by that you don't want to hurt. You might have to repeat this several times over several days to kill all the weeds.
 Some people have found that the waste water left over from boiling eggs kills the weeds faster than water alone. Pour the water on the weeds immediately after you remove the eggs.

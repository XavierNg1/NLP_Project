 When you have a dream, write down as much as you know. Just don't get too excited, or some memories will be lost to history.;
, Put it near you when you sleep, because in sleep you might blurt out some stuff, so listen to it when you wake up. Only listen to about 2 memories,and keep waiting until you've written a lot. One whole page is perfect. More is better.
 When reading your dream journal, try to find any patterns or things that keep appearing in dreams, such as true loves,Â enemies, or even magic things.



This will help to know your dreams, and might even recover lost memories. Go to a quiet place and listen to the outside nature. This will create focus, and soon you will be able to meditate.
 Now we want to have control.
, If you know it is, do some reality checks and try to do small things only. Then move to big things, such as flying, using powers, or even controlling anything.
 Do whatever you want, but try not to get excited. Do little things first, or else you'll wake up. Enjoy your control and power.

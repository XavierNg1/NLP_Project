 Holding the cord taut, carefully wrap it around the handle near the blade. Place your thumb on the side of the cord to keep it in place as you wrap. Make another loop under your first loop, making sure that the cord is tight as you work., Take some electrical or grip tape and wrap it around the loops that you created. Wrap the tape tightly so that the cord doesn't move around., Start making tight loops around the tape that you laid down. Continue to make tight loops all the way down the handle until you reach the bottom of the handle. As you wrap, make sure that the loops are touching one another., Once you've wrapped your handle, tie a knot at the bottom of your cord to keep the wrapping in place., Finish your wrap by cutting away the excess cord with a knife or scissors. Hold a lighter up to the tips of the cord until they start to melt. This will seal off your knife handle wrapping.This method also works as a "pre-wrap" that you can do before wrapping your knife handle with a more complex method. Doing a simple preliminary wrap will make more advanced wraps adhere to the handle better.

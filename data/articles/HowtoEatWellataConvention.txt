 Get a nice stainless steel water bottle. Fill it every couple of hours.;
, Not just the dealer's room; find a convention suite, a snack table or any rooms with particularly charitable convention-goers. Try to find a fridge if you're bringing your own food. Mark it on your maps.
 Peanut butter and crackers are a great snack and bringing fruits or vegetables that do not bruise easily (oranges, apples, carrots) will go a long way toward providing healthy food.
 This isn't a major step, you just need to determine if you'll be leaving the con for a real meal. Don't spend more than nine dollars a day on snack food or you'll not only go over budget, you'll ingest an unhealthy amount of sugar and fat before the convention is over.
 Take it with you if you can.
 Wash your hands as often as possible (definitely after using the bathrooms, which are usually filthy). Keep a travel bottle of hand sanitizer with you and use it prior to handling any food on the go.
 If you don't like tea or it's too hot, wait until it has cooled and down it in one gulp. Certain teas help calm you, notably chamomile tea.
 Free candy and sweets are OK, just not for every meal.

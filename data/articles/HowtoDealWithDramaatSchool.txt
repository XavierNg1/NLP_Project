 No one is going to remember rumors and gossip in a few years. It should not matter if you kissed the geekiest person in school. It is your business and no one else. Let everyone that asks know you did, and then they'll get over it.


Attempting to hide something you did will make it worse. If you show that you don't care, the person who is questioning you will actually subconsciously feel stupid and respect you more. (This happens because they realize how immature they are being for trying to stir up drama - even if they don't admit it.);
, If you or your friends are fighting over something, just don't get involved. Tell them both you value your friendships, but you are not a vigilante. If anything, try to help them work it out through logic. But, if you are going to do this, know your limitations. Not everyone is able to get involved in an argument without choosing a side or making it worse.
 They are looking for attention, and giving comebacks or engaging in "Facebook Wars" is just going to give them exactly what they want. If you must say something, make your point and move on.
 People will always talk. Don't give them anything to talk about, don't discuss your sex life, your grades, and your family life to people you don't know if you can trust. This will only lead to trouble.
 This is a huge struggle for most teenagers. If you get a feeling that someone's 'friendship' isn't good for you, you're probably right. Everyone has faults, but some people purely enjoy stirring up drama., Don't change yourself because of their opinions - be who you want to be. It's hard to do, but it's worth it and will bring you more happiness in the end.

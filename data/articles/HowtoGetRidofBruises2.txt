 Do this several times a day beginning the day after the bruising occurs. This will help your body's normal lymphatic process to clear it away.


Keep in mind that the pressure shouldn't be painful. If the bruise is too painful to touch, hold off.
 Ultraviolet light breaks down bilirubin, which is the product of hemoglobin breakdown that causes the yellowish color of a bruise. If possible, expose the bruise to sunlight (safe amounts, don't sunburn) to accelerate the isomerization of the remaining bilirubin.


Try to get 10 to 15 minutes of direct sunlight a day. This should be enough to help break up your bruise without leading to a sunburn.

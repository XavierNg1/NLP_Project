 Place a large skillet on the stove and set the heat to medium-high. Add the cumin seed, and toast them until they turn fragrant, about 1 minute.
 You can crush them using a smaller pan, or a flat-bottomed metal or wooden tool. Remove the seeds when you are done, and set them aside.
 Put the bacon into the same skillet you used to toast the cumin seeds. Cook the bacon over medium-high heat until it turns crispy. Once it is done, set the bacon aside on top of some folded paper towels, but leave the drippings in the skillet.
 You will be using the bacon and beef drippings to cook the rest of the ingredients.
 Reduce the heat to medium, then add the chopped onion. Sauté it until it turns brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. Then, add the toasted cumin seeds, chili powder, paprika, oregano, black pepper, thyme, salt, and minced garlic. Sauté for 1 minute more, stirring occasionally.
 Crumble the bacon first, then add it to the skillet. Add in the rest of the ingredients, and give the chili a stir to mix everything in.
 Add more water as necessary to keep the chili from drying out. You can also cook this in a slow cooker for 6 to 8 hours.
 Using a slotted spoon or fork, scoop out the ancho chilies, and purée them in a blender. Add the puréed chilies back into the skillet, and give everything a good stir.
 You can serve it as is, or you can garnish it with some chopped onions, shredded cheese, or crumbled saltine crackers. This recipe also goes well with tamales or rice.

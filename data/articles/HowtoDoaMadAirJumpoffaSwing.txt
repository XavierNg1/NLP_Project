 A swing anywhere, in your backyard or a park. The swing can't be directly behind a fence, and the swing must be easy to push.;
, You must be super high for best results. To tell when you're high enough, you must feel a huge rush of air every time you go up and down.
 Once you're high enough, prepare to do the jump. When you go up, count "1". When you go up again, count "2". When you go up the last time, count "3".
 When you're on "3", push don't stop swinging. After the three, you keep swinging and suddenly you push your legs out and jump. Never stop swinging on all the numbers you count. You have just did a mad air jump!

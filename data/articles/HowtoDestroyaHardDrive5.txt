 That thing where running a magnet over a computer to erase it is basically a myth. If you want to destroy your data by magnet, you’re going to need to pull out the big guns.
 These should work well enough to scramble any remaining data after wiping your drive. And, really, who doesn’t want to own a giant, super-powerful magnet? You will find other uses for it. Surely. Fun level (wiping the drive): 4; fun level (finding other uses for the magnets later): 9


Alternatively, take your hard drive to a local junk or scrap yard...any place you can find with one of those big magnetic cranes for lifting cars and other large scrap. Watch as your drive performs a Cirque du Soleil level of flying-through-the-air as the data is made thoroughly unrecoverable. Fun level: 5. Unreliable though, drives are well shielded against magnetic fields. Physical destruction is best.

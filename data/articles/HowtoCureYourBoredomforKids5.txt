 Tell a sibling you're bored. Then they will start giving you options, so that means you are making progress. If this is happening, start getting comfortable. Just start talking to them, saying odd, boring or loud things; or say something combined. Just say it a lot of times. The next thing is that they will send you to annoy another family member, and that means you finally irritated them. It is very funny when you actually do it.
 Find a good prank, set it up and wait for the fun to unravel. Have a camera ready for the priceless look on their faces!

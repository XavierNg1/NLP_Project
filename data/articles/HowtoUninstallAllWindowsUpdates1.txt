Windows 8 and later - Click the Power button in the Start menu or screen. Hold ⇧ Shift and click "Restart." Select "Troubleshoot" → "Advanced options" → "Windows Startup settings" and then click "Restart." Select "Safe Mode" from the menu.;
, Once you're in Safe Mode, you'll need to open the Programs and Features window from the Control Panel:


Windows 7 and earlier - Open the Start menu and select "Control Panel." Select "Programs" or "Programs and Features" (depending on your view settings).
Windows 8 and later - Right-click on the Windows button and select "Programs and Features."

, This can be found in the left menu. A list of installed updates will be displayed.
 The "Installed on" column can help you find the update that started causing your computer troubles. Windows updates are listed in the "Microsoft Windows" section towards the bottom of the list.
 You'll be prompted to confirm that you want to remove the update. After confirming, the update will be removed. You can repeat this for any other updates you want to get rid of.If Windows is set to update automatically, the updates you delete will likely download and install on their own again. You'll need to disable automatic updates in Windows Update to prevent installing these specific updates.

 An I-9 form documents that an employee is authorized to work in the U.S. Both citizens and non-citizens must complete and present you with an I-9. You must hold onto these forms for three years after the date the person is hired or for one year after employment ends (whichever is later).You can scan and store these electronically, but you must hold onto them.;
, Although it is illegal to hire undocumented immigrants, you also cannot discriminate against immigrants who are in the country legally.You should document thoroughly the reasons why you hired or did not hire someone.
 You also need to avoid hiring minors illegally. Minors have complicated laws which restrict their ability to work. The U.S. federal government limits those under 16 to working a maximum of three hours a day during the school week and a maximum of 18 hours for the school week.The federal government also prohibits work from 7:00 pm to 7:00 am. During the summer (June 1 to Labor Day), the prohibition starts at 9:00 pm.
State laws may be different. You should contact your state’s Department of Labor to find out the rules governing when minors can work and how much work they can perform.
Always be sure to check that the minor has provided you with proper identification which shows their birthdate, such as a valid driver’s license. Make a photocopy of the license to keep for your records.

 Only buy wild caught fish, not farmed fish. The aquaculture industry currently does not universally follow a number of recommendations designed to decrease the levels of various pollutants.
 Because only eating wild caught fish will eventually lead to fish depletion, agencies have set up sustainable sources. These sustainable sources, such as the Marine Stewardship Council, work with fisheries to keep oceans healthy while holding these fisheries to standards. Look for fish packages that have labels from a sustainable source., Keep a check on the Environmental Defense Fundâ€™s Seafood selector as often as possible to find the best current choices.Currently, the best fish to eat are:


Albacore tuna from the US and Canada
Atlantic mackerel from Canada
Pacific sardines from the US and Canada
Sablefish/Black cod
Wild salmon from Alaska

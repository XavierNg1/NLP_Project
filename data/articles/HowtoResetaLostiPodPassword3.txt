 This is to ensure that you do not lose any information in the process of unlocking your phone and you can simply plug in our device and allow the sync on your computer. Wait for it to sync completely before moving onto the next step.
 This will be under "MyComputer" if you are allowed to view hidden files. Once there, go to the folder entitled Device.To view hidden files, click the Start icon, then "Control Panel." This will give you the option to select "Appearance and Personalization." After that, go to "Folder Options."
Under the "View" tab, select "Advanced Settings," then "Show hidden files, folders, and drives." When prompted, select "Ok.", If your iPod is currently locked, there will be a file labeled "_locked". By simply renaming this file to "_unlocked", you will be able to access your iPod.
 Your iPod is now unlocked and you may go to settings in order to set a new passcode.


While this method will unlock your device, it may not allow you to reset the password without using your old passcode to change your settings. If this is the case, trying using the iTunes method instead.

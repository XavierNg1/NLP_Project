 Look for the game app on your device. Its name is Spider-Man with the classic Spider-Man on the logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 On the main page, tap the red “My Team” button on the lower left corner. This will bring you to your current Spider-men roster.


All your Spider-men’s character cards are displayed on the right side. Swipe up and down to view all of them.
 Each Spider-Man character you get needs a character slot in your team roster. When the slots run out, you can’t add more Spider-men in your team. You need to have some available to bring new ones from the portals. Swipe down to see how many empty slots you still have.
 If you decide to get another character slot, tap the green button on the last locked card slot. Doing so signifies you want to buy it.


Character slots cost from 5 to 20 ISO-8.
 After buying the slot, it will be unlocked. You now have an additional character slot for another Spider-Man.

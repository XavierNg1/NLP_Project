 The most common mistake made in the quest for a happy marriage is to expect that someone should be "making" you happy. The old saying "to have friends requires one to be a friend" applies.;
, The only way you can be happy is by focusing on your own efforts to make your marriage partner happy. In essence, a marriage is no different from any friendship with shared goals and responsibilities and the added bonus of readily available sex.
 As a general guideline, one should think how you would treat a friend you are very fond of and apply the same principles. No friendship would survive if you do not invest in spending time together and doing things together.
 Similarly, one cannot expect to find happiness in a marriage relationship without spending quality time together, making eye contact (a fact know to increase bonding) and doing novel things together.
 Our behavior is not dependent on our emotions - psychologists know that our emotions are more often the result of our thoughts and actions rather than the end all and be all so in a nutshell and at the risk of oversimplifying it: Act happy, think happy, feel happy.

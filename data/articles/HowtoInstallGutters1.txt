 Gutters should be attached to the fascia and run the entire length of the roof, ending with a downspout. If a gutter run will measure longer than 40 feet (12 m), the gutter should be positioned to pitch down from the middle, aimed toward a downspout at each end. A fascia bracket will be attached to every other rafter tail, or approximately every 32 inches (81 cm).


Depending on the type of gutters you want, expect to pay anywhere from $2 to $6 per linear foot for aluminum gutters. Copper gutters could run as much as $20 per linear foot.Expect to pay approximately $2 per linear foot for downspouts, and $6 to $10 each for the brackets that attach the gutters to the fascia.;
, What good will installation be if the fascia holding your gutters up rots away? To inspect the fascia, poke at the ends of fascia boards, or where two ends of fascia boards meet. If it feels spongy or compromised, you may want to consider replacing the fascia before moving on.


Think about replacing the fascia with more resistant material, or just sticking with wood.

If you believe the rotting is caused by excessive moisture due to ineffective gutters, then wood might acceptable. (You are going to install working gutters, after all.)
If you believe the rot to be caused by other factors, consider choosing a material like aluminum or vinyl that withstands the elements a bit better than wood.

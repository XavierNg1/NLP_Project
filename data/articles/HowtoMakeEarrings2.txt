 To make hoop earrings you will need a tube of memory wire, a memory wire cutter (pliers will leave dents in the wire), round nose pliers, two French hook earwires and a selection of beads (optional).
 This will form the hoop of your earring. If you want a smaller-sized hoop, use the cutter to snip off a section of wire.
 Take your round nosed pliers and use it to curl one edge of the wire hoop underneath itself, until it forms a complete loop.
 If you want to make beaded hoops, thread the desired number of beads onto the wire - you can experiment with different colors and bead types to find a pattern you like. For plain hoops, just skip to the next step.
 Take the pliers and use it to curl the other edge of the wire - except this time you are curling the wire outwards rather than underneath. Curl it until you form an almost complete loop.
 Hook the loop that's curled outwards into the loop that's curled underneath. If necessary, use the pliers to tighten each loop. This should keep the earring secured.
 Take the French hook earwire and use your pliers to open the loop at the bottom. Hook the open loop of the earwire onto one of the closed loops at the top of the earring hoop. Close the loop with your pliers.
 Remember to measure the second hoop against the first to make sure they are the same size.

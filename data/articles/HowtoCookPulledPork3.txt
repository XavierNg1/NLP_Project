, Place 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy dutch oven. Put the dutch oven on a burner over medium high heat. When the oil is hot, put the pork shoulder in the dutch oven and cook it on one side until it gets brown, about 5 minutes. When the first side is brown, flip the pork over and brown it on the other side.









Don't cook the roast for too long at this stage; the point is just to brown the roast to bring out the flavor.
Use a large pair of tongs to flip the roast carefully, so it doesn't splatter.
 Put a lid on the dutch oven and place the roast in the oven. Cook the roast for about 3 1/2 hours, until the meat falls apart easily when it's poked with a fork. Remove the lid from the dutch oven and put the roast back in the oven to cook for another 1/2 hour.

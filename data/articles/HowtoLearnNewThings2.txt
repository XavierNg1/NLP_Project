 There's no reason not to learn the things that fascinate you. Nothing is off limits to your mind. What do you fantasize about? You may always have held off from learning music because you knew you'd never be a professional musician. This may be true, but that's no reason not to learn music.


If there's a subject you think you're bad at, try tackling that. Even if it's hard for you, you can still increase your basic understanding. Start slow, and get help when you need it.
 One way to motivate yourself is to learn skills that can improve your ability to do your job well. Ask yourself what would make you a better candidate for promotion: coding ability? Writing skills? Foreign language fluency? Management training? Are there classes you can take or books you can read that would give you a broader understanding of your field?


Ask your boss what training your company offers. Explain your goals. There may even be funding available for certain skills you would like to learn.
 When you are learning a new thing, you are entering into unknown territory. Allow yourself to experience the confusion of unanswered questions and unfamiliar parameters. When you study a new topic, don't look up answers to your questions right away. Instead, spend some time trying to figure the answers out on your own. This kind of trying (and failing) helps you better understand what you are learning..


Challenge yourself by trying to replicate a dish you enjoyed at a restaurant without looking up a recipe.
Seek out disorienting media, such as classical music, reports on ongoing scientific investigations, and books of contemporary poetry.

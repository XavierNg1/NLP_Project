 Fill a sink or small bucket with vinegar and dunk your head (or your child’s head) in with eyes closed. After hair and scalp are fully soaked in the vinegar, remove and dry with a towel.


While this will not kill lice, it will make it difficult for them to attach to hair. It will also kill nits, but you should use a fine-toothed metal comb after completing the treatment to scrape out nits that may have survived.
Since there is no need to mix it with anything else, applying vinegar to the hair is a simple and easy way to deal with lice.
Any type of vinegar will do, though the acid concentration should be between 5% and 7%.
When using any method involving vinegar, keep the eyes closed tightly, as vinegar can cause irritation of the eye. Children, especially, should be directed to keep their eyes closed tightly.
 To do so, soak a washcloth in vinegar. Grip a lock of hair at the base with one hand, and wrap the vinegar-soaked washcloth around the lock of hair as close to the base as possible with the other hand. Pull the washcloth along the lock of hair you want to remove lice and nits from.


Holding the lock in place with your other hand is important because if you don’t, you’ll be tugging at the roots of the hair and experience pain.
Like the vinegar soaking method, this method will only kill nits. Use a fine-toothed comb to remove nits that you may have missed.
 For instance, you might mix a quarter-cup of salt with a quarter-cup of vinegar. Shake the mixture in a spray bottle and spray some on your hair. Cover your hair with a shower cap for two hours, then wash your hair. Repeat three days later to ensure you’re totally lice-free.


Do not use this method if you have any rashes or cuts on your scalp.

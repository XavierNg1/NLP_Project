 These should be about an inch from each end of the branch. The slits should be angled toward the branch so that the string will stay in place.
 First tie a strong knot at the first slit. Pull on the string to make sure it stays in place.
 Make a knot at the other end, about 6 inches (15.2Â cm) shorter than the length of your bow. This will give the bow tension and curve after it has been strung.
 Bend the bow and slowly pull the knot until it reaches the slit on the other end of the bow. If you did everything right, then the string should be tight and give the bow a slight curve.
 If left strung for too long the bow will bend and lose tension.

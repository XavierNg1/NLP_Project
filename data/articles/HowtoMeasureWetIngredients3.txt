 Many European recipes use weight or mass instead of volume to measure, especially for baking. Statistically, measuring by mass produces more accurate results, so especially if you bake a ton, you may find a kitchen scale useful.They’re easy to find in kitchen-supply shops and on Amazon.1 cup of water weighs 8 ounces, or 240 grams. 1 teaspoon of water weighs .17 ounces or 5 grams, while 1 tablespoon weighs .529 ounces or 15 grams.
 This will help you more accurately eyeball how much liquid you need to add. If you don’t have a liquid measuring cup, any sturdy (and preferably clear) container will do. Whichever vessel you choose, make sure it’s centered on the scale., This is called “taring” or “zeroing.” If you’re using a mechanical scale, twist the knob on the side until the weight dial reads “0.” If you’re using a digital scale, simply press “0” or “All Clear (AC).” Either way, this step is crucial, as it takes out the weight of the container you’re using.
 Pour in the liquid to the approximate volume measure that you’re trying to reach. Pour a thin stream, and make sure to have one eye on the scale’s reader in order to make sure that you don’t add too much. If you add too much, you can spoon it out until it’s at exactly the right weight., If the recipe calls for milk and vanilla mixed together, you can measure them both by weight in the same cup! Measure out the first liquid, then tare the scale. Add the correct weight of the second liquid, and you’re done.

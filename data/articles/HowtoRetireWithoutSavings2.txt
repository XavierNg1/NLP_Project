 Reverse mortgages are a type of loan on home equity available to senior citizens.The borrower gets a loan for the value of the homeowner’s equity—the equity isn’t withdrawn directly. The loans are structured in the following ways:


The equity can be treated as line of credit.Like a credit card, the borrower can use the credit in the home as needed (although there may be monthly maximums).
The borrower can also a monthly payment for a fixed number of years. This is called a term payment plan. Even if the value of the home decreases, you’ll still get the same amount each month.You can also opt for a tenured payment plan. This is a lot like a term payment plan, except the term lasts until the borrower leaves the home. Even if payments under the reverse mortgage stop, the homeowner cannot be evicted from the home., There’s certainly nothing to prevent you from selling your home outright and moving into something smaller. This strategy makes sense for a lot of people. Oftentimes a retiree is living in the same home where they raised their family, but with half the inhabitants.How much you spend to buy your new home will depend on how much you made on the sale of the old one. Nonetheless, try to find something as modest as possible. You want to maximize the cash you get from the sale of the home. That way, you can invest it or purchase an annuity.
 Even if retirement’s only a few years away, investing a little bit now can add up quickly. However, all retirement accounts are not created equal. You should invest in the following order:Invest in 401(k)s first. Since your employer is (probably) matching your contribution up to a certain limit, this should be the first account you contribute to. Anyone over age 50 can contribute up to $24000 per year, and that doesn’t count employer contributions.
Invest in IRAs last. Since there’s no matching employer contribution, invest in your IRAs last.

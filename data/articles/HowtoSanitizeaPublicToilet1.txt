 Public restrooms may have toilet seat covers made of lightweight wax paper that you can place on the seat. Use these covers to create a barrier between your skin and the toilet seat, which may help you from coming in contact with bacteria.These covers are usually on the wall of the restroom or in holders in each bathroom stall.
If there is any material on the seat or it is wet, wipe it off with some toilet paper before you place the cover on the toilet.
Place the cover with the center tab hanging down into the water so that it flushes away after use.
Consider carrying a personal single-use toilet seat cover for situations when no cover is available.;
, Some public restrooms now have automatic plastic seat covers that seal the toilet each time it is flushed. These will automatically create a barrier between your skin and the seat and don’t require you to touch the toilet in any way.


Consider resealing the toilet twice if you notice any material in the toilet. Some studies show that water from the flushing toilet may spray the plastic cover, making it less hygienic., Some public restrooms don’t offer toilet seat covers. If this is the case, you can easily make one out of toilet paper. This will create a barrier between your skin and the seat and may help protect you from any bacteria lingering on surfaces.Place a single or double layer of toilet paper around the toilet seat.Flush the paper cover so that it isn’t on the seat for the next user.

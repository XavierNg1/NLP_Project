 Even if you eliminate roaches from your specific apartment, they will keep returning if the building is not treated. Roaches can inhabit the walls and spaces between units, or travel between units in a building., They love the carbohydrates and sugar found in your food, soaps, and even plants.


Keep food (for humans and pets) in glass or plastic containers, with lids that fit tightly. Transfer any food that you keep in bags, boxes, or other materials that are easy for roaches to chew through.
Replace bar soap with liquid soap dispensers, and spread a bit of petroleum jelly on plant holders and pots to keep roaches away from the plants in your apartment.
Keep garbage, compost and recycling in tightly sealed containers, and take out your garbage frequently.
 Crumbs, spills, and stains will attract roaches. Clean kitchen surfaces thoroughly after preparing food. Sweep up crumbs and mop up spills immediately. Scrub inside cabinets and around and under appliances.Take extra care to sweep and scrub up any roach droppings that you find, since these can attract other roaches.
 Roaches like to hide in boxes, stacks of paper, or piles of laundry. Avoid storing paper bags, magazines, or newspapers on the floor or in cabinets., Keep your bathroom and kitchen as dry as possible. If you have leaky pipes or worn grout, bring them to your landlordâ€™s attention. Mop up spilled water immediately, and wipe down sinks and bathtubs immediately after use. You may wish to empty pet water dishes overnight., Roaches travel in and out of walls, doors and windows through cracks as small as 1/5 inch (0.5 cm). Check your window screens, doors and walls for holes or other damage. Put weather stripping over any cracks in your doors. Cracks and holes in the walls can be repaired with spackle or caulk. You may wish to consult with your landlord before attempting any repairs yourself.

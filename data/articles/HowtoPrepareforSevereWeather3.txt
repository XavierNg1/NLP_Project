 Severe storms are often accompanied by strong lightening. If you are outdoors, seek shelter immediately. Stay away from trees and out of water. Try to find an open business (hotel, fast food restaurant, etc.) to stay in until the storm passes.
 If the power goes out, use a radio. This way, you will be informed if there is or may be a tornado.

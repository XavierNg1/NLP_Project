 Layer the rabbit pieces, celery, carrots, onion, water chestnuts, and mushroom inside the slow cooker. Pour the chicken broth over the contents of the slow cooker and sprinkle with salt and pepper as desired.

If you are not sure about how much salt and pepper to go with, try 1 tsp (5 ml) of salt and 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of pepper.
 Cover the slow cooker and let the rabbit cook until it becomes tender enough to fall apart when cut into with a fork.

The cover must stay on throughout the entire 6 hours. If you remove the cover, you will allow some of the heat that has built up inside to escape. This heat is an essential element involved in cooking the contents of the slow cooker, though, so letting any at all escape can affect the cooking time.
 Vigorously whisk the two ingredients together in a small dish until well combined into a slurry., Remove the rabbit from the slow cooker and stir the corn starch slurry into the remaining sauce. Cover and cook on high for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the sauce thickens.

Alternatively, you could pour the sauce into a medium saucepan and add the cornstarch slurry to it that way. Heat the contents of the saucepan on medium-high until they reach a boil. Let boil for 1 to 3 minutes, or until the sauce thickens.
Keep the cooked rabbit pieces warm as you thicken the sauce.
 Add the rabbit back to the sauce in the slow cooker and mix gently to coat.

The purpose behind this step is to coat the rabbit in the final sauce while also reheating it through.
 Transfer the rabbit pieces to individual serving dishes. Ladle the sauce over the rabbit before serving.

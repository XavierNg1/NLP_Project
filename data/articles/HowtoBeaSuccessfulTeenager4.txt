 Independence is very important to a teenager. It comes as a necessity over time, but when teenagers start off being independent, it usually comes as a privilege from your parents. Figure out your home dynamics, and offer areas where your independence becomes helpful to your household: for example, cooking your meals, cleaning up after yourself, taking care of younger siblings, asking for less supervision, getting a part-time job, etc. As you gain more responsibility and independence, be aware that failure might occur and is to be expected. Learning from failure, however, will help you to grow., Getting from place to place does not always mean driving, but as a teenager, driving is a huge step in responsibility and independence. Be sure to take any courses and means to obtain a driver's license. Also, driving is not the only way to get around. Cities have public transportation that can be both cheap and accessible for teenagers. Learn the routes needed to get you from place to place. It will teach you time management and patience.
 As you grow up, your city gets smaller, and the world gets bigger. Family vacations help you explore certain regions, but taking on world travel also helps build responsibility and independence. A younger person has more outlets to travel by such as study abroad, language exchange, or volunteer programs. If you have family in distant places, reconnect with a summer visit. The chance to travel gives experiences that build great character., Being responsible and independent does not mean being alone. Taking on new tasks and meeting goals will be hard work. Asking people for help shows maturity and confidence. Seek advice from parents, older siblings, mentors at work, teachers, or someone whom you trust. Opening up channels of communication at a young age is a great habit for success.

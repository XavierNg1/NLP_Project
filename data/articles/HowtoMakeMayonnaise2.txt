 Add mustard and salt. Mix to combine.
 Add drop by drop, stirring constantly. Make sure that each oil drop has been properly absorbed before adding the next drop. Once you notice the egg yolks thickening, the oil can be added in a thin stream. However, do not add the last third of oil until next.
 Add it drop by drop and alternate with the remaining third of the oil. Continue until the vinegar has been added.
 Once again, do this slowly and by drops. Stir constantly.
 Cover and refrigerate.









The mayonnaise can be stored for up to 5 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Do not leave out for more than an hour during use, especially in hot weather.

 It goes without saying, this is always a good strategy in life, but when you have an enemy who’s trying to bring you down, it’s especially important. This is because you can’t change your enemies—you can only change how to react to them.


Avoid the temptation to get revenge or otherwise hurt them.
Don’t react to provocations.
 Your enemy has a harder time being mean when you are being friendly. It may be hard to be nice—fake it if you must—but taking the wind out of his sails by doing what he doesn’t expect can be a good way to cool down any conflict.


Smile and make eye contact.
Acknowledge his presence, but don’t engage in conversation.
 Even if your enemy is trying to derail you from doing what you need to do, it’s key to not let him influence your decisions or obstruct your progress.


Pursue whatever goal(s) you have that your enemy is trying to sabotage.
Consider your goal achievement as a kind of reward for tolerating your enemy.Don’t act like he does—you will always be glad you stuck to your principles.

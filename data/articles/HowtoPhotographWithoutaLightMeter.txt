Each time you double or half the light, it's called 'one stop' down or up.
Note that the ISO and speed numbers correspondingly change by a factor of 2.
 That's probably the only difficult part to remember.


Try to remember the basic setting, which, incidentally, on antique cameras, are usually the only ones that are marked: 32, 22, 16, 11, 8, 5.6, 4, 2.8, 2, 1.4 (...1, 0.7, 0.5...). A step to the right in the list means double the light (one stop down).

Brightly lit indoors, no windows (or nighttime) - f 1




You can guess all other conditions by filling in between. For example,

, Say you want to shoot on a sunny day with some clouds. When a cloud hits the sun, bring down one 'stop' - from f16 to f11. Or you want to photograph a back-lit face on a a bright day, you treat it like it's light shadow - we said thick shadow is f4, bring it one stop up - to f 5.6. Dimly lit indoors at night? Two stops down from f1 to f 0.5.
 One more thing - from the above rules, you can conjure other combinations of speed and aperture that will give the same amount of light.


For example, ISO 400, shutter 400, f 16 (sunny 16) = ISO 400, shutter 800, f 11.
Also equal to ISO 400, shutter 200, f 22. What you're doing is bring shutter one stop up (halve the speed, i.e. double the exposure duration from one 400th to one 200th of a second) and the aperture one stop down (halve the area of the opening)
Most lenses do not have f 0.5. And only expensive lenses even have 1.4 and f 2. In a way, those values can be considered hypothetical.
So, for example you have film with ISO 400, and you are shooting a not very brightly lit room. According to the above, f=0.5. say your widest aperture (lowest stop) is f4. there are 6 stops from f4 to f 0.5 (2.8, 2, 1.4, 1, 0.7, 0.5). Therefore, you need to reduce the speed 6 stops from 400 to 6Â : 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6. You probably need a tripod, because this is 1/6th of a second and the picture will be blurry due to handshake.
 It takes a while to get used to these calculations but remember that film is very forgiving - you can mess it up by 3 stops and chances are it'll still be a usable photo, especially with black and white film. And over time you will develop an intuitive feel for the required settings, just like you know to put a sweater on a fall day.

 Launch Google Play on your device and search for “IR blaster.” Several IR remote apps will appear in the list. One of the apps in the result should be a large red box with IR inside of it. Tap the three dots beside the app name and select “Install.” Follow the prompts on the screen to finish installing the app.
 Locate the app on your home screen or app drawer, and tap it to launch.
 When the app loads, a pop-up will appear over the top of the default remote. This just explains how to access the menu by swiping in from the left side of the screen. The default remote that is displayed should work for Samsung TVs, but if you want to change it, do the following:


Swipe in from the left and tap “IR Database.” Scroll up and down through the list of different manufacturers, and tap on the manufacturer of the device you want to control to continue. Note: Not all manufactures may be on this list.
If you are interested in other types of remotes, like cable boxes or Blu-ray, there should be a list of different types at the top of the same IR Database page. Scroll through them by swiping right or left on the top of the screen. Select the type you want to proceed.
 Once you have selected the remote you wish to use, it should automatically appear on your Android screen. Aim it at the device you wish to control, like you would an ordinary remote control, and hit the red power button in the upper left-hand side of the screen to test it out.


The remote should look pretty much the same on screen as in real life, in most cases. Press a few different keys to make sure everything works (Volume, Channel, Menu, etc.).

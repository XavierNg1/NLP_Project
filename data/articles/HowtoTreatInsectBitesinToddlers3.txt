 Mosquito bite symptoms, such as itching and inflammation, can be reduced when you apply calamine lotion to the bite spot. You can also rub an ice cube on the bite to numb the area so that your child wonâ€™t feel as much of an itching sensation.If you are in an area where mosquitoes carry dengue fever, monitor your child for 7 to 15 days. If your child develops a fever during that time, take your child to the hospital, as the mosquito may have been carrying dengue fever.
 If your child has been stung but is not showing signs of an allergic reaction, remove the stinger and then clean the site with water and soap. Apply a cold compress to the area. If the itching or pain is very bad, consider giving your child an antihistamine (for the itching) or ibuprofen (for the pain). However, consult your doctor about these medications before giving them to your child.


If your child has an allergic reaction to the sting (as described in the previous method) bring him or her to the hospital immediately.

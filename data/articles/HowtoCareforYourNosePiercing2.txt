 If they take you into a room without sufficient lighting, question it. They should be able to see what they are piercing. Also, watch them wash their hands and put on sterile gloves. If they already have gloves on, you are completely justified in asking them to re-wash their hands and replace the gloves with new ones.
 While you’re getting your nose pierced, try to stay as still as possible for your piercer. It is a small pinch just like any other piercing, and you’ll only feel it for a second.
 Titanium and surgical steel are good substitutes, but most piercers include the price of a surgical steel piece of jewellery in the price of the piercing. If you ask for gold, titanium, and niobium (niobium is the material least likely to irritate your skin) the piercer may add an additional cost.
 The needles that they use should be brand new and in sterilized sealed pouches. You should see them open the sealed packages. If you get into the room and the needles are already open, you are once again justified in asking for new ones.
 Your piercer should throw away the needles in a biohazard container after using them. They should also provide after-care instructions at this point.Most piercing salons will carry the cleaner that they are going to recommend to you.

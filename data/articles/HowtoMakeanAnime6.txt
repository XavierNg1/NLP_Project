 This is the easiest way to make fans. Your family and friends are bound to be supportive and they will probably share your work with others that they know. This can help you build a small base.
 Publishing your work on the Internet is a great way to start to build an audience. You can’t expect to get paid for the stuff you create immediately, but if it becomes popular then you might be able to! Try to market your blog through social media by creating a Twitter and Facebook page for your anime. , Try to find someone who is excited enough about your story and anime to consider publishing it. You can find a publisher near you online. Look for someone who specializes in anime and who has a history of getting other young artists started. Who knows, they might love your work.
 If you don’t want to send the whole story you can just send out chapters of your anime to shorter competitions. There are plenty of film and writing related competitions that accept anime, as well as anime specific competitions that you can find online.

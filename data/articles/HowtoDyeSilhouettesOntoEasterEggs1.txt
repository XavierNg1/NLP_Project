 You can use hard boiled or hallow/blown-out eggs for this method. If you will be using hallow/blown-out eggs, be sure to cover the holes with some speckling or paper clay. White eggs will give you the best results, but you can use brown eggs for a more interesting effect.
 Pour 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) of water into a cup. Add 1 teaspoon of food coloring and 10 to 20 drops of food coloring. Stir everything together with a spoon.Make sure that the dye is deep enough to submerge the egg in.

Try mixing food coloring colors for a more unique shade.
You can use a store-bought egg dyeing kit instead. Prepare the dye according to the instructions on the package.
 Choose a sticker with a well-defined shape. Press the sticker against the egg and run your finger nail across it, focusing on the edges. This will seal the sticker and keep any dye from creeping underneath it.Round or blob-shaped stickers are not recommended because they don't give good silhouettes.
You can make your own sticker buy cutting shapes out of adhesive vinyl., Leave the egg there for 2 to 5 minutes. The longer you leave the egg, the darker the shade will be.If you are using a hallow egg, you will need to hold it down so that it doesn't float., Use a wire egg holder or a pair of tongs to lift the egg out of the dye bath. Hold it over the cup and let any excess dye drip down, then set it aside so that it can dry., Once the egg is dry, carefully peel away the sticker. This will reveal the white (or brown) silhouette underneath. Discard the sticker when you are done.

 Develop a love for sweets. Show people that you're into the sugary style. Do something like decorating a class project with drawings of cupcakes or jelly beans. You'll need to be able to draw well though, so you can make a good impression.;
, Know what it means to be "bubbly". A fun and vivacious person is irresistible, so you'll need to work on that. Act Perky and Be Quirky. Always be happy and playful, but don't overdo it or you'll come off as straight-up annoying. If you have a hard time perking up, think of something funny or positive. Also, skip. It may sound childish, but it displays your liveliness. Don't do it too often though.
 You don't know how far laughing will get you. Only laugh when the joke is funny, or you'll be the only one laughing. There may be some things that only you would find funny, and that's OK-- just laugh for a few seconds, then stop and say "That's not funny." Make sure to smile a lot. Make your pearly whites your favorite accessory. You should also have a good sense of humor. Know what's funny and what's not. The most important part of having a sense of humor is being able to laugh at yourself instead of other people.
 Don't care what other people think. Being sweet does not mean being a pushover. In most cases, "I don't like you" means "I'm jealous of you". What's the point of being around someone who doesn't appreciate your sugar high? If someone has insulted you, don't even entertain it--just act like you didn't hear it. Think of it like you're too cool to even respond to that person. Just keep your head up and keep walking.
 Keep in mind that being able to defend yourself is just as important as being able to walk away from danger. Don't start fights, but don't be afraid to get into one. Remember that your first weapon is your voice. (Example: What did you say?)

, Make funny faces, and try to be as entertaining as possible as long as you don't joke about the wrong stuff.

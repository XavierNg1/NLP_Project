 Always watch your posture. This means walking with your head up, shoulders back and direct eye contact. Gliding into a room with this attitude will immediately send an air of superiority.


For ladies, wearing heels helps create the image. By towering over others, you will seem better than them as they will be forced to look up to you.;
, All great snobs know everything, of course. Even without formal training or education in a given subject, you can offer up a poignant thought on anything from wine to classical music. Avoid considering anyone else’s thoughts, ideas and feelings on a topic. Use terms like avant-garde and noir to make yourself sound more intelligent.
Question why others didn’t ask your advice when making a particular decision. , You have a personal rating scale that you use for everything: people, vacation spots, happy hour locations, etc. and it’s foolproof. Be sure to let everyone know where each thing falls on your snob-o-meter. How else will they know that you’re right and they’re wrong? When sharing your thoughts, be sure to include words like “should” and “always.”
Dazzle those around you with as many off-the-cuff responses as possible. Keeping them on their toes will ensure your snob status.
 Proclaim with all the confidence you can muster that you simply don’t do certain things. Everyone should understand that you are above manual labor like scrubbing the dishes and yanking weeds from the garden. Even at work, you huff and puff when someone suggests that you make a breakfast run or fix the copy machine…even if it is in your job description.


You can do this by just refusing. Sooner or later, they will stop asking.

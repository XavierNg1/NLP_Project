 Get the theme going right away with the right invitations. When sending out invites, pick cards that use a dinosaur theme. You can try dinosaur-shaped cards, or cards that are embellished with drawings of dinosaurs.If you want to make the cards yourself, or if your child does, buy some blank cards. Handwrite information on the front like the date, time, and so on.
You can cut out cardboard shapes of dinosaurs using stencils and paste them on the inside of the invitations. You can also use stickers to decorate invitations.;
, Using stencils and cardboard, cut out a variety of prehistoric footprints. Have footprints of multiple different dinosaurs. Have them running up your walkway into your home.If you live in an apartment, talk to your neighbors. Ask them if they would mind if you added some footprints in the hallway just for the day.
 You can opt for decorative tablecloths, which you can buy at most department stores, decorated with images of dinosaurs. However, you can also use plain green or gray tablecloths and decorate from there.For example, lay down a gray tablecloth and scatter fake leaves over it. You can make the leaves yourself using stencils and cardboard or purchase fake leaves.
Then, you can place plastic dinosaur toys running down the center of the table. This creates a fun, prehistoric theme.
 You can stop by a local party store or print out photos of your own. Having photos hung up of dinosaurs all over the wall will really set the dinosaur theme.You can do cartoonish dinosaurs, using supplies from a local party store. You can also print out pictures of realistic dinosaurs.
If you use realistic dinosaurs, try printing out information about them too. This will help kids learn while enjoying the party.

 Cover can be anything that offers you momentary safety. Be aware of your surroundings, and don't allow yourself to be boxed into a corner.Cover can be distance – if you can remove yourself from the situation, your attacker can't get to you. Plan your escape route in advance.
Cover can also be a physical barrier, like getting to a bathroom or supply closet and locking your attacker out.
 The best way to avoid getting into trouble is to remove yourself from a fight before it happens. But if you are attacked by a violent person and can't get away, you will need to defend yourself as best you can. You can't really learn these moves without practicing them, so sign up for self defense classes before trying them in person.Make a fist and swing upward, hitting your opponent's nose squarely with the heel of your hand. The upward movement carries a lot of force, and is easier to pull off than a boxing-style punch.
Kick your attacker's knee by using your foot in a horizontal stomping motion. Be sure to take aim first, and strike suddenly before they expect it.
Use the instep of your foot or your knee with as much force as possible to connect with your opponent's groin with an swift, upward motion.
Alternate your strikes between face and body – when your opponent goes to protect one vulnerable area, they will leave another area open to attack., Even if you have been taking self defense classes and doing well, never assume you will win the fight. There are too many things that can go wrong, and you can never predict the outcome. If you let the situation get out of control, you are far more likely to get caught and get into trouble.


If you underestimate your opponent he or she may catch you off-guard, and hurt you.
You are far more likely to get caught if you are reckless – you won't pay enough attention to your surroundings and witnesses.

 The most helpful one is the one that has the 'wand' attachment. That is a flexible connector that allows the motor part of the tool to be prone, while you manipulate the more flexible working end of the tool.;

 You don't want to apply continued pressure from whichever tool you choose to use. You want to almost 'pat' them.

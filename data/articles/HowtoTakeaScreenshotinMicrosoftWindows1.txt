 This will capture an image of your entire screen and copy it to the clipboard. The dimensions of the image will be the same as your desktop resolution.


The ⎙ PrtScr button may be labeled "PrtScn", "Prnt Scrn", "Print Scr", or something similar. On most keyboards, the button is usually found between F12 and Scroll ⇩. On laptop keyboards, you may have to press the Fn or "Function" key to access "Print Screen". You will not receive any confirmation that the screenshot has been taken.;
, Once you’ve made the screenshot, you will need to paste it to a program in order to see it. The most common way to paste it is into a Paint file. This will allow you to save it as an image file that can be transferred to others.


Open Paint from the Accessories section in your Start menu. With a new blank canvas open, press Ctrl+V to paste the image onto the canvas. You can also open the Edit menu and select Paste, or right-click on the canvas and select Paste.
Click File, then Save to set the name and file type of the image. The most common file types are JPG and PNG. The recommended format for screenshots is PNG, due to the high quality and small file size.
You can also paste the screenshot into other programs, such as Word or into the body of an email. Simply open the program that you want to paste the image into and press Ctrl+V.
 When you press ⊞ Win+⎙ PrtScr, you will save a full-screen screenshot directly to a file without having to paste it into another program first. The file is saved to the Screenshots folder in your Pictures folder. If the Screenshots folder does not exist, Windows will create one.


The picture is saved in PNG format.
Screenshots are automatically labeled "Screenshot", and a number will appear in parentheses for each consecutive screenshot.

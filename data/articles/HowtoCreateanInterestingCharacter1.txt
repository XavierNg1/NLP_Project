 That way you can see what the rest of your character will become. Plus, it is easier to pick a name with everything else out of the way.;
, EX: Funny, Smart, Clumsy, Loud, Outgoing.
, EX:


Funny when around the people who they are more comfortable with, Smart in writing, but horrible in science and math, Has two left feet, Can never be outspoken, Always has to have the last say, Bold with friends, but shy around others. Lets people walk over them; doesn't stand up for themselves. Has a very low self-esteem.
 Don't make one trait Happy and then another Depressed all the time. Unless you do a person who puts on a happy face but when in reality is very depressed on the inside. Then, that would be okay.

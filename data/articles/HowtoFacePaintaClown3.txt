 Pierrot clowns are sophisticated, quiet, and tend to be dressed elegantly, with features that are understated instead of exaggerated. They look like ghosts. Their makeup usually involves a full face of white paint with delicate colors. The first step is to paint your entire face white, from the top of your forehead to below your chin, and from earlobe to earlobe. Be sure your eyebrows are covered. Set the paint using powder and a puff.
 Make your eyes look hollowed by rimming them with black paint. Line the top and bottom of your eyes and paint your eyelids black. Use mascara to cover your eyelashes in black, too.
 Dip your applicator brush in black paint and make a pair of small, downward-sweeping eyebrows about an inch above your real eyebrows. The eyebrows should give you the appearance of being sad and serious. You can use the black paint to create other small features, like a black teardrop flowing from one or both eyes. Some people simply draw a black dot on both cheeks.
 Use lipstick or red paint to make a small, rose-colored mouth, about half the length of your real lips. You can also lightly rouge your cheeks or make a defined red dot on each one.

 Grab a clean bowl and an empty paper plate. You’ll fill the bowl with your Mod Podge and then use the paper plate to catch errant glitter.
 Have everything ready to go including the glitter bottles (opened), candle unwrapped and paintbrush tapped for loose bristles.
 Dip the paintbrush into the Mod Podge and cover one side of the candle with glue. Work quickly, as you don’t want the Mod Podge to dry before adding the glitter.
 Catch any excess on the paper plate. Be sure to cover the candle well so that no hint of the wax is showing (or areas of the candle you don’t want to show).
 Recycle for another use. You want full coverage but you probably don’t want glitter to fall from the candle onto your cake; it's safe enough but not really meant to be eaten.
 Then repeat the process on the other side of the candle.
 Once dried, the candle is ready for use.

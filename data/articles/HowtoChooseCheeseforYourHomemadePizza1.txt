 Instead, buy mozzarella in a block from your grocery’s deli. Then, shred the mozzarella at home. Using shredded deli mozzarella will provide a creamier and richer cheese flavor.If you are making a thirteen inch pizza, then ask for a four to six ounce block of cheese. If your pizza is smaller, then ask for less cheese.;
, Whole milk mozzarella has a creamier texture (similar to cream cheese) and has more flavor than skim milk varieties. The creamier texture and better flavor is due to the higher fat content. However, it has only one to two more grams of fat per serving than skim milk mozzarella.Because whole milk mozzarella has a richer flavor, you do not need to use as much cheese if you were using skim milk mozzarella.
 This version of mozzarella is the classic Italian cheese for pizzas. Fresh mozzarella is sold in eight-ounce balls. It is usually vacuum-sealed in a container sitting in whey. Because this cheese is soft and breaks apart easily, it cannot be shredded.When using this cheese on your pizza, slice it up and place the pieces spaced apart on the pizza. The mozzarella will melt and spread out over the pizza.
You can find fresh mozzarella at your grocery store’s deli.
Fresh mozzarella has a short shelf life and should be used within a week once it is opened.

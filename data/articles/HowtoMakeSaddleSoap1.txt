3 1/2 cups of water



 


1/4 cup of neatsfoot oil






3/4 cup of grated Ivory soap






1/2 cup of grated beeswax or paraffin;
, Add the 3 1/2 cups of water to a pot and bring to the boil over a high heat. Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to medium.
 Add the grated ivory soap to the water and stir until melted. Then add the grated beeswax or paraffin oil and stir until melted.
 Take the pot off the heat and add the neatsfoot oil. Stir the contents of the pot continually until the soap mix cools and thickens.

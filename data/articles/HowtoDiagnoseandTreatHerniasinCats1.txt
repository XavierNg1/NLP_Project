 Umbilical hernias are very easy to detect. After birth, check the abdominal area of the kittens. An umbilical hernia will be a bulging area of tissue around the belly button. This hernia will feel soft. If you push it in, it will pop back out immediately.Some umbilical hernias will gurgle when you press on it.
Some kittens may also vomit and refuse to eat.
They develop soon after the kitten is born if the opening in the abdomen that was connected to the umbilical cord does not close properly.;
, If you notice an abnormal bulge in the belly button area or hear a gurgling sound when you press on the kittenâ€™s abdomen, take them to the vet. The vet will perform a physical exam, which is usually enough to identify the hernia.The vet may also ask you basic questions about the hernia, like when did it appear, has it gotten large, has the kitten been performing basic bodily functions, or has the kitten seemed like they were in pain.
 The vet may decide to do an x-ray or ultrasound on the abdomen. This can help determine the extent of the damage associated with the hernia. The vet will need to see if part of the intestine is inside the hernia.Determining if the intestine is involved helps the vet decide on treatment.
 Uncomplicated umbilical hernias often heal on their own by the time the kitten is six months old. The vet will check the kitten when it is taken to be desexed. If the hernia is still a problem, the vet will suggest surgery., Complicated hernias occur when abdominal organs shift through the hernia and past the muscle. This generally leads to death of some tissue and part of the intestine. This type of hernia will not fix itself, so the kitten must undergo surgery.The vet will remove dead and scar tissue and then close the hernia with sutures.
Most kittens have a complete recovery after this procedure.

 Aldan is where people mostly have spikes and expect you to offer 4 den betas for wrists. Try to trade your betas for a spiked wrist. Get at least 4 long spiked wristbands or 6 good short wrists (if possible, 4 black short wrists).
 See above for the guidelines of the rarity of spikes. Try to get the spiked wristbands you need before trading for a spiked collar.
 Do not try trading fake den betas - you would have basically scammed that jammer you traded if they accept the fake den betas you offered. Some examples of den betas are Cami's frog (most jammers think this is not a den beta, but it actually is), pot o' gems, robots, televisions, etc.
 Most walls or floors are worth spikes themselves, or 2 smaller den betas. Trade a good wall/floor and a bad wall/floor for a short spiked wristband.
 Use your wrists to trade for short collars, and trade your short collars for long collars. You can also try trading den betas for anyone who wants den betas for their spiked collars. If you have 62 den betas and someone wants them for their black long spiked collar, you might be very lucky.

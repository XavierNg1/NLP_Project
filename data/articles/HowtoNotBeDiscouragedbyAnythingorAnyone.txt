 If you are discouraged , then it's feeling is like someone has stolen your smile . But in that case , spend few hours alone with the nature . Go out for a walk . Think why you are discouragedÂ ? Talk to yourself . And enjoy the cool breeze of the nature , chirping of birds and rustling of nature . Just dilute yourself in it .;
, Your biggest mistake is that you are letting that discouragement to fill your mind . There's only one person who can truly understand you and it is YOU . Don't care of things or persons that discourages you . Bury them somewhere .
 Don't believe something that someone else said. Just keep minimizing that thought and throw it out of your brain.
 the only way of loving yourself is by doing what you love and in what you are satisfied . Produce new thoughts . And do a new starting .
 You are special . You are different . You are strong . Live every moment as it will be your last . Your life , your way of living . And you must know that there is always someone who will care for you and will always love you . (If you are a Christian know that no matter what Jesus always loves)

 Command blocks are not craftable and therefore you need to use the command /give (minecraft username) command_block.
 You can craft a daylight sensor by going into a crafting table, putting 3 glass blocks on top, 3 nether quartz in the middle, and 3 wooden slabs of any type on the bottom.
 You might need to dig a lot, but you only need a minimum of one piece, and there is no maximum.
, Enter the command: /time set night.
 It will turn back to night.

 Do not make the sides gently slope; otherwise it will flood more easily. Make steep slopes around it. The ditch should be at least three feet deep., Make sure there is at least a few feet extra of tarp extending around the ditch., Raise an edge/water-run-off barrier around it. Try adding some stones or such around the edges.

If you want to use manure (as fertilizer), soak about 1-5 (depending on your ditch size) pounds of it in buckets of water for a day. Spread the mixture on the bottom of your ditch after putting the tarp.
 Some online stores offer dechlorinating liquid in bulk. Leave about a foot of ditch height uncovered by water, to prevent flooding., You might want to cover the ditch with another tarp to prevent insects such as mosquitoes from getting in., Add your duckweed, a pound for every five-ten gallons. Make sure there is empty surface area on your water so the duckweed has room to grow., Perhaps add other compatible aquatic plants (the duckweed might block the sunlight getting to them or vice versa, so try to choose plants that do well without much direct sunlight). Do not add fish if you do not have an established pond; fish need more than just water! Manure in the water will also harm them.

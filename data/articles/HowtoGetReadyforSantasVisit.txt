 This way, Santa will be blessed by seeing a nice place and won't trip over anything.;
, Before Santa Claus (aka Father Christmas) arrives, make sure you hang up your Christmas stockings over the fireplace or at the end of your bed, ready to be filled with fun sized gifts.
 Sliding down millions of chimneys and delivering presents all over the world in one night can be very tiring. Santa Claus needs to keep his sugar levels up. Leave out a few cookies by the Christmas tree to give him that extra burst of energy he needs to make it round the rest of those homes on Christmas night.
 It can be thirsty work too, so ask an adult to pour Santa a glass of milk and have it waiting for him. He'll be very grateful for this drink on a cold winter's night.
 Of course, it's not just Santa who has work to do on Christmas Eve. In fact, the hardest part of the job is done for him by his magical reindeer. Leave them a few carrots to munch on. They'll provide Rudolph and the rest with some much needed energy as they fly around the globe, making sure the big man gets where he needs to be, when he needs to be there.
 Whatever you do, you must make sure that you are tucked up in bed before Santa arrives. He will only visit your house once you are asleep. And don't think you can outsmart him by pretending. He can always spot a faker. The sooner you go to bed, the sooner it'll be Christmas.
 If you've been good all year, on Christmas morning, you could wake up to find a mountain of presents under the Christmas tree. The cookies and the milk will be gone and so will the carrots.

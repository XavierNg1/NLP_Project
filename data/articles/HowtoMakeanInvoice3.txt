 The name, address and phone number of the business you are invoicing should appear on the left side of the invoice, below the header.


If you are invoicing a person, rather than a business, include that person's name and the address and phone number you have on file for that person.
If you don't have an address and phone number for the business or person you are invoicing, include an email address instead.
 On the right side of the page, across from the recipient's contact information, include the details of your invoice. Write the following information on separate lines on the right side of the page:


The invoice number. Type INVOICE: followed by the number. Since you are the one sending the invoice, you may choose the numbering system that works best for you. You can number your invoices numerically (1, 2, 3, 4) or by date (for example, 2010-10-16, for the year, month and day of the invoice). If you choose the latter, you can add "-01" to the end to differentiate between invoices sent on the same day. In any case, make sure you number your invoices in sequential order so you don't confuse yourself.
The invoice date. Even if you choose to number your invoice by date, you should clearly write the date on a separate line.
The invoice due date. If you have an agreement with the business you are invoicing about when you can expect to get paid, write that date as the due date. If you don't have an agreement, figure out the standard pay-by period in your industry; in most cases, it's 30 to 45 days.
 Under the invoice information, note whether you will take cash, checks, credit cards, PayPal or some other form of payment.


If you charge a late fee, quickly outline this as well, if you haven't outlined it somewhere else already, like in a contract.
Include your tax identification number, if applicable. Laws vary by municipality, so be sure you know your local tax code if you are to collect sales tax or some other usage tax, like the hotel tax.

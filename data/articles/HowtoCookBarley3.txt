 Meanwhile, prepare your vegetables.


Prepare the onions, carrots, and celery by chopping them into bite-sized pieces.
Prepare the mushrooms by soaking them in hot water. Note that this should be done about 30 minutes in advance. Strain the water, the chop the mushrooms.
 Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent, about five minutes.
 Cook the mixture for two minutes more, stirring frequently to prevent the garlic from burning.
 Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms are soft. This should take another five minutes or so.
 Lower the heat to medium-low, and sprinkle the flour evenly over the vegetables. Stir the mixture every 30 second for roughly five minutes or until everything seems sticky, thick, and well-coated., Turn the heat to medium high and add the broth about 1 cup (250 ml) at a time, stirring to combine well. Bring the soup to a slow boil once all of the broth is added.


Adding the broth gradually should make it easier for the flour to incorporate itself into the liquid, thereby thickening it. Adding the broth all at once may result in clumps or an unevenly thin consistency.
 Allow the liquid to reach a boil again, then cover the stockpot.
 Allow it to cook for one hour, stirring occasionally. The soup is ready to serve when the barley is tender and the soup has thickened.


If desired, you can adjust the seasonings near the end of the cooking time. Consider adding more salt or sprinkling in some chopped parsley as desired.
 Serve the finished soup while it is still fresh and hot.

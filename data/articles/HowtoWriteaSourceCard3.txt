 Sometimes the author of a website can be difficult to find. However, on good websites, the author should be under the title, at the bottom of the page, or on the “About Us” page. Write the name of the author on the upper left-hand corner of the notecard. IN this example, the author's name is Greg Haws, so the name is written as follows:


Haws, Greg.
 Establish the title of the particular page you sources your information from, which may be different from the main website. In this example, the specific page being referenced is “Cows Like to Moo”. Write this information beneath the author's name, and be sure to put quotation marks around it.


Haws, Greg.
"Cows Like to Moo"

, Now you’ll need the title of the website. In this example, the website is named “The Story of Cows”. Place this information beneath the specific page, and underline it.


Haws, Greg.
"Cows Like to Moo"
The Story of Cows

, Next, add the year of publication below the title of the website. The year should be at the top of the webpage, under the title or at the bottom of the webpage. If the article also has a month and date, include those too. In this example, the year is 2001.


Haws, Greg.
"Cows Like to Moo"
The Story of Cows
2001.
 In addition to the above-mentioned information, you’ll need to add the date on which you accessed the site. This information is important, as websites can change or disappear over time. In this example, the website was accessed on the 18th of June, 2014.


Haws, Greg.
"Cows Like to Moo"
The Story of Cows
2001.
June 18, 2014.
 Finally, you’ll need to include the exact URL of the website, so your readers can access the information themselves, if they wish. In this example, the fictitious example used is www.thestoryofcows.com/cowsmoo.


Haws, Greg.
"Cows Like to Moo"
The Story of Cows
2001.
June 18, 2014.
www.thestoryofcows.com/cowsmoo

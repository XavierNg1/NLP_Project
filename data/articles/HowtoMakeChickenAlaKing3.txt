 Set a large skillet on the stove, and add 4 tablespoons (57 g) of unsalted butter. Turn the heat to medium, and allow the butter to melt until it becomes foamy.The butter will melt more quickly if you cut it into pieces before placing it in the skillet.
 Once the butter has melted completely, add the finely chopped shallots to the skillet. Cook them over medium heat until they are softened, which should take approximately 3 minutes.


To ensure that the shallots cook evenly, use a wooden spoon to stir them occasionally as you heat them.
 After the shallots have softened, mix in the sliced cremini mushrooms. Allow them to cook over medium heat until they have softened as well. Typically, that takes about 5 minutes.Remember to stir mushrooms occasionally as well, so they don’t burn.
 After the cremini mushrooms have cooked, mix 2 teaspoons (11 g) of kosher salt, ¼ teaspoon (2.5 g) of freshly ground black pepper, and the coarsely chopped porcini mushrooms to the skillet. Stir the mixture well to ensure that it’s well blended.

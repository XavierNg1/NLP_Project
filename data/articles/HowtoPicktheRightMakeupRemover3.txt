However, exposing your skin to alcohol-based removers on a regular basis can damage your skin over time, so avoid using them when you can., Some websites suggests using nontraditional makeup removers like baby oil. This helps you stay away from makeup removers that have alcohol in them, but using something like baby oil can also clog your pores. You want your makeup remover to remove product from your face, not just add new stuff, so try to avoid those types of removers., A lot of makeup companies add fragrances to their makeup removers to make them more attractive to consumers. However, if you have sensitive skin, fragrances can actually irritate your skin. Avoid them when you can.Fragrance-free makeup removers are also best if you have acne, since they won’t irritate your skin further.If you don’t have sensitive skin, you can use removers with fragrances if you like, but the purer the composition of your makeup remover, the better.

 If your teacher tells you the date when you are running it, be prepared. Practice the pacer test at home with a 20-meter distance. Search for "Pacer Test Audio" in YouTube and pick a relevant result to get the beep sounds. You can practice outside or inside, as long as you are in a space where you can run a distance of twenty meters back and forth. Even if you don't like running, training will improve your score and you'll be able to tolerate the test more.;
, Water is great when you are running, and it will keep you hydrated throughout the duration of the test. You will obviously not be able to grab water in between laps, so right before the test, take a drink of water. Not so much where you need to use the bathroom, but enough where you feel hydrated. After you are done running the test, be sure to grab a drink of water immediately, to prevent dehydration.
 It will make you lose and/or not be able to set a good pace for yourself, and everyone will most likely all be at a different pace. Therefore, when you are running, try your best to block all of the other runners out, and go at your own pace. In the beginning, run a bit slower, but be sure to gradually go faster.
 Everyone is sweating and out of breath too, so don't feel bad if you slow down. Push yourself hard, but not too hard. You should always make a goal number of laps in the beginning that you should try to meet. It will make you work harder, and you may achieve the goal that you set.
 Even if you are getting tired, do not just sit out, as that's the worst thing you can do. Walking for what will be your last lap will most likely make you feel much better.
 Your muscles might be sore for a while, so be prepared for that by taking the time when you get home to relax if you can.

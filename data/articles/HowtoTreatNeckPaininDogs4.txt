 Cervical disc disease, also known as a slipped disc, tends to happen as dogs age. Typically discs "slip" in one of two ways: disc extrusion, in which the nucleus pulposus slips out from the center of a vertebra and causes damage to the spinal cord, or disc protrusion, in which the fibrous ring around vertebrae grow thicker, causing the spinal cord to painfully contract.Typical symptoms include:


Neck pain/sensitivityYelping or cryingRigidity of the neckDifficulty or inability to lower the head during feedingDifficulty walkingArched backDown-turned headIncontinenceParalysis, A veterinarian is the only person who can diagnose cervical disc disease. He will probably take X-rays of the neck and spine to determine whether a disc extrusion or protrusion is the cause of your dog's pain., Unless your vet recommends surgery to correct the slipped disc, the best way to treat cervical disc disease is through supportive care.Keep walks relatively short. Use a harness on walks instead of locking the leash to your dog's collar, as a collar may put additional strain on your dog's neck.Administer any pain medication or muscle relaxants your vet prescribes for your dog.

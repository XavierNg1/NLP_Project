 Do this by opening this link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/.
 You can do this by clicking the plus icon on the bottom righthand corner of the web page. A new, blank slide will open.


If you already have an existing file you want to add music to, just select it from the list of presentations displayed to open it.
 The second way you can add sound is to insert the video itself on to your presentation. To do this, click on “Insert” from the menu toolbar located on the upper-left portion of the web page and select “Video” from the drop-down list. The “Insert Video” window will open.
 Select “Video Search” from the left menu panel on the “Insert Video” window and you’ll see a search bar that you can use to look for videos on YouTube. Type in any item relevant to the video you’d like to add and click the magnifying glass icon to start searching.
 Click the video that you’d like to add from the search result list to select it then click the “Select” button to add the selected video to your slide.
 Once the video has been inserted, select the arrow button from the menu toolbar. Using your mouse cursor, click on the corner points of the video you’ve just inserted and drag it across the slide to adjust its size to your preference and location.


Resize the video to its smallest size if you just want your audience to hear it play and not see the video itself.
 Click “View” from the menu toolbar and select “Present” from the drop-down list to play the presentation. While the presentation is in view, click the video you’ve inserted to play it.

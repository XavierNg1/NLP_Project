 Castor oil packs aid in the elimination and detoxification of the colon. Get a flannel cloth, which can be cotton or wool, plastic saran wrap, a bath towel, a hot water bottle or heating pad, and castor oil. Pour oil onto the flannel until it is well moistened. Lie down, placing the flannel directly onto your abdomen. Place plastic wrap over all sides of the flannel to prevent staining of your clothes or bedding. Wrap the towel around your torso over the plastic. Then apply the hot water bottle or heating pad (set to medium) over the towel. Rest for 10-30 minutes. Remove the flannel and clean your abdomen. You may reuse the flannel without washing it for approximately 3 weeks. , Enemas can be used to help with bowel cleansing during a detox program.

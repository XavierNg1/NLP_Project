 You can do this either by using a measuring tape to measure the circumference of your neck and then adding an inch, or by simply wrapping the ribbon around your neck and then adding an inch. When you’ve got the right measurement, cut the ribbon.
 Fold one end of the ribbon back onto itself to create a loop about ¼ - ½ inch long. Sew it in place with thread that is a similar color to the ribbon. Do the same thing on the other side of the ribbon, making sure to fold it in the same direction as before, so that the cut ends both lay on the side of the ribbon that will not be visible when you wear it.








If you are in a hurry or don’t feel like sewing, you can always opt to simply tie the ribbon in a bow at the back of your neck. If you want to do this, you should add an extra two or three inches to the diameter of your neck, rather than just one., Cut a two or three inch length of string or embroidery floss. You may want to select one that is a similar color to the ribbon, but it will not be visible from the front, so any color will do if that’s not available. Just thread it through the loops you sewed, and tie the ends together to hold your choker in place. Trim any excess string.
 For a slightly classier look than just tying it on with a string, add a clasp and chain. These can be purchased online, or you could just recycle one from an old necklace you don’t wear anymore. The choker should already be pretty close to the right length, so a half-inch in length on either side should be fine. Jewelry chain is very fine, so you should be able to cut it with an ordinary pair of scissors. Just sew it in place by threading the needle through the links in the chain a few times.

 If you notice that bacteria or fungus has stained the liner, use a bleach based cleaner. These stains will look like dark spots on the liner. Combine one part chlorine bleach and one part water. Use a spray bottle or a small garden sprayer to apply the bleach cleaner to the liner. Let the cleaner dry on the liner so it can remove the stains.You can clean any spots on the liner while the pool is full by applying the cleaner above the water line. Or you can drain the pool to clean the entire liner.
Wipe off any excess bleach cleaner on the liner once the stains have been removed. Rinse the liner with water so there is no remaining bleach on the liner.
Be careful when using bleach. Wear gloves when you touch the bleach and do not ingest any of the bleach.
 Look for alkaline based cleaners for vinyl pools at your local hardware store or online. Alkaline based cleaners will be gentler on the vinyl than acid based cleaners and work well on stains or discoloration. Apply the cleaner using a spray bottle or a small garden sprayer.Once the cleaner has been applied and the stains or discolorations have been removed, make sure you rinse the liner well with water.
 If you have stains and scum on the pool liner, you can use a stain cleaner made for vinyl pool liners. Look for stain cleaners at your local hardware store or online. You can find ones that come in the form of an eraser that you can attach to an extendable pole. You can then wipe off stains like algae, rust, paint, and oil.You can use the stain remover on specific spots on the liner with the pool still full of water. Or you can drain the pool to remove stains on the entire liner.
Make sure you rinse the stain remover tool well once you are done using it. Use clean water and let it air dry outside. This will ensure the chlorine in the pool does not deteriorate the tool over time.

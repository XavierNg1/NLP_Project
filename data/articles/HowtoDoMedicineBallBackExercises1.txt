 You can also use a carpeted area, but a yoga mat is preferable, as you want to be able to keep your body as straight as possible throughout the exercise.


Medicine balls vary in both weight (from 2 pounds to 30 pounds) and material (hard plastic, dense rubber or synthetic leather).Choose the type and weight that works best for your level of fitness. It’s better to start with a lighter weight ball and work your way up to a heavier one to avoid injuries.;
, The ball should not be directly in front of the mat, but placed within arm's reach on one of the shorter ends of the mat.
 Your head should be facing the ball. When you extend your arms to grab the ball, keep them as straight as possible.


Keep your legs extended straight along the mat. You can point your toes or relax them.
Give yourself enough space to fully extend your body without bumping into anything.
 While gripping the ball, raise your arms and legs at the same time. Hold the position for a minute or two at the top.


It's fine if your legs only rise a few inches above the mat. Your back muscles will still get a workout.
Keep your core tight and make sure to keep breathing!

, Don’t hurry this part of the exercise. Take a deep breath and slowly bring your arms and legs to the ground. Your core should still be tight and you should feel the muscles in both your back and abs being engaged.
 Try to do two or three sets of 10. This beginner level exercise will help to work your lower back, which is often forgotten due to lack of visibility. Remember that weak lower back muscles put you at risk of developing poor posture.

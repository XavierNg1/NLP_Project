 Calling Nickelodeon directly isn't a matter of using one single telephone number â€” the network has regional offices all over the world, each with its own number. However, Nickelodeon's corporate headquarters are in New York City, so the number for this office is suitable for a wide variety of global questions and concerns.


If you're calling from outside the United States, don't forget to add your country's exit code before dialing the phone number.For instance, people in Australia should dial "0011" before proceeding "1-212..."

, As noted above, Nickelodeon has a number of smaller regional offices besides its New York headquarters. These may be more suitable for local questions and concerns than the New York headquarters, so you may want to use these numbers instead, especially if you live near one of these offices. Three of Nickelodeon's most important regional offices' numbers are listed below:


Florida: 1-407-363-8500
California: 1-818-736-3000
London: 1-732-779-8353

, If you're a journalist or a member of the press, rather than calling Nickelodeon's offices, use the company's press and PR contacts. These professionals' jobs are to help ensure that your question or concern is answered as quickly as possible, so they're usually a much better choice for fact-checking questions, company information, and so on than any single office.


As noted above, Nickelodeon has too many press contacts to list here. For a complete list of phone numbers, use the same Press page as referenced above for online press inquiries.

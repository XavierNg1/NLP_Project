 The pot should be deep enough so the sides are at least 4 inches (10cm) higher than the oil. When deep frying, there should be enough oil to completely cover the food you are frying, but the pot should not be more than half way full of oil.To fry, use a vegetable oil with a high smoking point and little to no flavor, like refined peanut oil, canola oil, grapeseed oil, or safflower oil.If you don't have a heavy cooking pot, or one with a very thick, heavy bottom, you can use a wok or a deep sauté pan instead.;
, Use a frying, candy, or thermocouple thermometer. These thermometers show temperatures up to 500ºF (260°C).To check temperature of the oil, hold it in the center of the pan. If your thermometer clips to the side of the pan it will be easy to keep track of the temperature as you work.If you don't have a thermometer, stick a wooden spoon, skewer, or chopstick into the oil. If the oil bubbles around the wood, it's hot enough for frying.You can also use a kernel of popcorn to check the temperature. It will pop in oil that is 350ºF (178ºC), so you will know when it is close to optimum frying temperature.If the oil begins to smoke, it's too hot. Carefully removed your pan from the stove to cool.

 Heat 2 qt (2 L) of distilled water to a temperature between 98 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit (37 and 40 degrees Celsius).


Pour the water into a small saucepan or kettle. Place it on the stove and heat it over medium until it reaches the desired temperature.
 Add 2 tsp (10 ml) of pure sea salt to the warm water. Stir until the salt dissolves.


An enema prepared with pure sea salt is one of the gentlest types you can use, making it a good option for someone who has never used an enema before. The salt reduces the amount of water absorbed into the bloodstream but does not draw water in or out of the colon, which means that this enema will feel more tolerable than most others.
For a much stronger enema, use 4 Tbsp (60 ml) of Epsom salts, instead. Epsom salts contain a high dose of magnesium. They increase water in the intestines, thereby flushing the colon out more rapidly. Do not use Epsom salts if you are experiencing stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting, however.
 Administer the enema as you would any other. Retain it for as long as possible to maximize its effectiveness.


Note that a salt water enema prepared with sea salt should only be retained for up to 40 minutes.
Salt water enemas prepared with Epsom salt work more rapidly and may need to be evacuated after 5 to 10 minutes, but should not be retained for more than 20 minutes.

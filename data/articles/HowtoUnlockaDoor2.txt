 With many older doors, you need to pressure the door as you fiddle with the key, as the warped door is bending the lock at an awkward angle. Try applying pressure in each direction: up, down, toward you, and away from you. Use as much force as you can without losing your balance once the door opens.









If you are using a friend's key, call and ask him about it. He is likely to know the door's idiosyncrasies.
 There's no universal standard for which way a key turns to unlock a door. Even if you know which way is "unlock," turning the key further toward the "locked" direction sometimes causes the lock to unjam. If you can get the key to turn a short distance past the full locked position, rotate it back the other way in a quick, smooth motion and you may overcome the jam.
 Unless you plan on replacing the lock, choose a grease-free lubricant such as graphite powder, since oil will jam the lock even more once it dries out. A single, short spray or squeeze directly into the keyhole should be enough; too much lubricant can be counterproductive.









If you're trapped in a room, use any oil you have available, or rub the key with a graphite pencil tip.
 The problem could be a bent key, or a key with severely damaged teeth. Bending the key back into a flat position will sometimes serve as a temporary fix, if you have a clamp handy. Replace the keys at a hardware store as soon as you can.
 If you hear a click when the key turns, the door is probably unlocked but jammed, and a few thumps might open it. If the lock is jammed, hitting the lock several times might help after lubrication to help shift the sticky tumblers.
 You may have to set aside the key and use the lockpicking methods described in the section below. If that doesn't work, you may need to call and hire a locksmith.

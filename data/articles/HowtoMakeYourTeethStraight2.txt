 Aligners are made of clear plastic or acrylic that you wear over your teeth every day. See your orthodontist to have an aligner specially made for your mouth. You will need to revisit the orthodontist for a new set every month or so. This process gradually moves your teeth into a straighter position., Because your aligner is removable, you’ll be responsible for wearing it correctly. Follow your dentist or orthodontist’s instructions about how long to wear your aligner each day. Take out your aligner before you eat or brush and floss your teeth., There are numerous brands of aligners available, such as Invisalign and ClearCorrect. Your orthodontist can help you choose the best kind for you. Some internet companies offer less expensive, mail-order aligners that you use without seeing an orthodontist. Having a full examination by a professional is a safer way to straighten your teeth and know if aligners are right for you.

 Soak the wart for 10 to 15 minutes in warm salt water to moisten the skin. Scrape the dead skin layers off the wart using a nail file, pumice stone or mild sandpaper. You could also use your fingers, but wash them thoroughly before and after, as warts can easily spread. Moisten the wart and apply a large flake of sea salt to it.


Put a band-aid or tape over the wart to hold the salt in place and observe for several days, replacing it after you shower or if it falls off.
 Mix baking powder and castor oil into a paste, then apply it to the wart at night by covering it with a bandage. Remove the bandage the next morning. Repeat as necessary.
 Soaking plantar warts in very hot water is helpful because it softens the wart and may kill the virus. Make sure the water is not hot enough to cause burns—keep it under 140°F (60°C).
 Pick a fresh dandelion and Break the stem. Apply the milky sap that oozes from the stem onto the wart. Repeat this three or four times a day. Scrape the wart with pumice to remove dead layers of skin. Continue doing this until the wart fades away.

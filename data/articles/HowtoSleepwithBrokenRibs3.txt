 Sleep is essential for your body’s healing processes, so make sure that you are getting lots of rest.You should try to sleep for at least eight hours every night and nap during the day if you feel tired. Some good ways to make it easier to fall asleep include:


go to sleep at the same time every night
turn off all TVs, computers, tablets, and phones
make sure that your bedroom is dark, cool, and quiet
avoid drinking caffeine or alcohol before you go to bed
do not eat at least two hours before bed
do something relaxing before bed, such as listening to soothing music or taking a shower, Staying in bed all day is not a good idea when you have broken ribs. During the day, you should get up and walk around now and then. This will help you to get more oxygen and clear mucus from your lungs as well.Try to get up and walk around your home for a few minutes at least once every two hours.
 Not coughing when you need to cough can lead to a lung infection. Coughing might be painful when you have broken ribs, but it is important to do it anyways.Hold a blanket or pillow against your chest as you cough to help make it a little less painful.
 Getting adequate nutrition is also essential to your body’s healing process.Make sure that you are getting a balanced diet as you recover. Your diet should include:


fruits, such as apples, oranges, grapes, and bananas
vegetables, such as broccoli, peppers, spinach, and carrots
lean protein, such as skinless chicken, lean ground beef, and shrimp
dairy products, such as yogurt, milk, and cheese
complex carbohydrates, such as brown rice, whole wheat pasta, and whole grain bread

, Quitting smoking may help to speed up your recovery as well.If you are a smoker, then now is a great time to stop. Talk to your doctor about medications and smoking cessation programs that may make it easier for you to quit.

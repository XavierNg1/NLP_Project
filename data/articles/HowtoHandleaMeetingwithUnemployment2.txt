 Treat your meeting as a business meeting or interview. It is important to take this meeting very seriously. Your sincerity and professionalism will be gauged during the meeting.


Any suspicious behavior or misconduct may jeopardize your future benefits or require you take additional action such as attending additional meetings and specified classes, such as interview prep.
 Wear business attire for your meeting with unemployment. Attending a meeting in professional attire will allow the counselor or counselors to see you are taking your job search seriously, that you know how to dress for an interview/meeting and that you can appear presentable.
 Bringing a complete and professional-looking resume to your meeting will show you have put thought into your resume and are utilizing it to apply for a job. Without one, you do not have proof that you are actually applying for a job.

 A list of jobs you have applied for recently may be required for the meeting. In any event, it is good to show proof that you have been actively looking and applying for jobs.


Be prepared if you are asked questions such as when and how you applied for these jobs.

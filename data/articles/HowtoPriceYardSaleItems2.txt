 People won't expect to pay more for used baby clothes, since they're often inexpensive to begin with. Make sure the clothes are laundered and well presented to make the best sales.If the item is name brand with the tags still on, you can price it a little higher.


If you want to sell clothes that have been heavily used or are stained, price them at $0.50 or $0.25, just to move them off of your lawn.






If you have a ton of baby clothes to sell, consider selling them by the bag for $5.00 or so.
 Old shirts, pants, dresses, and other items shouldn't be priced higher than this, unless they're name brand with the tags still on. You might have more luck selling clothes if you leave out the oldest, rattiest items; don't make people dig too deep to find something worth buying.
 Be sure to polish the shoes to remove scuff marks and worn areas before you display them. If you have a pair of very gently used name brand shoes, you could price them a few dollars higher.


Old tennis shoes should go for less; you may even want to give them away for free.
Display shoes attractively, rather than throwing them all in a box.
 Launder the coats and display them neatly on hangers. Coats that look like they're 15 years old will sell for less, but if you have a name brand coat that hasn't been worn much, you can price it a little higher.

 Place your middle and index finger between two inside seams, like you're throwing a two-seam fastball. Lay or tuck your thumb under the ball lightly.
 Hold both index and middle fingers so that they run perpendicular to the U-shaped seams.


This gives you more of a cut on your sinker, so you have to be careful to keep both fingers on top of the ball until it's released. If your hand ends up closes to the side of the ball, this will pronounce the cutting action of the pitch and turn it more into a cutter.
Move your thumb from the 6 o'clock position to about the 7 or 8 o'clock position. This grip with your thumb will force you to throw the pitch in a certain way, creating sink.

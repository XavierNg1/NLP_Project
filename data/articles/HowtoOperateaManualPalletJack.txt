 Stand behind the manual pallet jack as this is the position you will be in when you move it. Find the small lever that allows the pallet jack prongs (the large flat metal pieces near the floor) to drop all the way down toward the floor.


The pallet jack drop lever is often a small lever in the middle of the rounded handle, on the vertical stem of the manual machine. It may be distinguished by a different color of plastic, or otherwise marked, or it may not be.;
, If the prongs are already completely lowered, you will not see them move. The prongs should only be an inch or two from the floor.
 You will see when approaching the skid whether or not the product will fit underneath. If they will not fit, the machine has not been lowered sufficiently, so try to push again on the drop lever.
 When the prongs are under the skid, pull the vertical stem toward you, away from the pallet and toward the floor in a diagonal motion. You should feel the pallet jack (and the pallet) slowly rising against the pressure of gravity.
 If the wheels are on the cross wood this will stop the jack from going up and also stop it from rolling.

Make sure that the pallet is jacked up from the floor before moving the manual pallet jack.
 When it looks and feels like the pallet is sufficiently raised so that it will not drag, pull on the pallet jack handle to move the raised pallet in any one direction. Alternately, users can push against the pallet when it's time to move the pallet up over a lift gate or onto a truck.

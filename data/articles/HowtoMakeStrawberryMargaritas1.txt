 In a small saucepan, combine 1/4 cup of granulated sugar with 1/4 cup of water. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat so the mixture simmers. Cook the syrup until the sugar dissolves. Refrigerate this syrup till it's cold.It will only take a few minutes for the sugar to dissolve and create a syrup. This should make about 1/4 cup of simple syrup.
Always be careful when handling hot sugar syrup since it could burn you.;
, Wash 1 1/4 cups of strawberries and cut off the stems. Put them in a blender with 2 tablespoons of your cold simple syrup. Blend the berries and syrup until you have a smooth strawberry puree.If you'd like to leave a few chunks of strawberry for your drinks, simply pulse the berries and syrup until you have the consistency you'd like.
 Transfer the strawberry puree to a tall serving pitcher. Add 2 1/2 ounces of freshly squeezed lime juice, 1 ounce of orange liqueur (like Triple Sec) and 2 ounces of tequila. Stir this mixture to combine it.Taste the mixture and add more simple syrup if you'd like it sweeter.
 Add ice to the pitcher and stir the margaritas to chill them. Or you can pour the margarita mixture into a martini shaker. Add ice to the shaker and shake the margaritas until the sides of the shaker are cold.Avoid letting the margaritas sit in the shakers with the ice too long. The ice will begin to melt and will dilute your drinks.
 Fill your glasses with crushed ice or ice cubes. Pour the margaritas into your glasses. This recipe should make two margaritas. Garnish the margaritas with thinly sliced limes or strawberries and serve them immediately.Have straws available for serving. Choose thin cocktail straws since this will make the drink last longer than if you use large smoothie-sized straws.

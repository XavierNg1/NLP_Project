 Create narrow pleats in your dupatta to begin. Then, drape the pleated fabric over your right shoulder and pin it in place. Make sure that most of the fabric is hanging down in back, but allow the fabric in front to hang down to the middle of your calves.
 Take of the corners of your dupatta from the front and bring it towards the left hip and around your waist. Tuck this corner into the back of your waistband on the right side.
 Take the piece of your dupatta that is hanging down in back and bring it around your left hip and to the front. Then, pleat one of the corners and pin this corner to your left shoulder.








Make sure that the pin is not visible.

 To avoid that annoying clang and bang noise of shoes drying in the dryer, suspend your wet shoes by their laces from the dryer door. Untie the laces of each shoe. Set the shoes side by side and gather all four shoestrings together in your hand. Tie all four laces together in a double-knot near the end of the shoestrings., Open the dryer door and grab the shoes by the double knot. Raise the laces until the shoes are in the center of the dryer door (on the inside of the door) with the toes facing up. Pull the laces over the top and down the outside of the door. Carefully close the door.


If your shoes will not stay suspended, add a small amount of weight to the end of the laces., Set your dryer’s temperature setting to low, delicate, or no heat and press start—drying your shoes on medium, perm press, or high with ruin the shoe. Check your shoes throughout the drying cycle to ensure that the soles are not warping. Once your shoes are dry, remove them from the machine and untie the knot in the end of the laces.Adjust the length of the laces to limit the movement of your shoes. Depending on how close your shoes are to the door, you may still hear clanging. If you still hear banging, stop the dryer, allow all items to come to a complete stop and then pull the laces tighter, or further outside of the dryer. Secure the laces; close the door and the restart the dryer.

 Go to other chat rooms, this way you will be meeting more people and you will have a better chance of making friends, than you would sitting in the same chat room for hours! Make sure you add every single person. Don't randomly add them though. Make sure you get into a nice conversation with them all first. Then add them. If a lot of people know you on IMVU (you have a lot of friends) than you will become popular.;
, If you make a lot of good popular products, people will share your name. So you will become known.
 Link the group to people, etc. To advertise make a banner. Then people will know you because your the creator/ owner of the chat room.
 The more you post and help people, the more people will see your posts and username, then you will be popular.

 If you sleep in the same room as them, poke them without being seen. Do this a few times, and then purposely get caught. It will annoy them more if they know it's you.


Continually poke them and jump backwards if they attempt to retaliate. This is famous for annoying people. Poke your sibling, run back, then quickly pick up a book and start reading.
 Car-rides can get really annoying for siblings because you're stuck in the same place together for a while.


Offer to give your sibling the front seat and sit directly behind them. Periodically, give them:





A wet-willy. Suck on your finger and stick it into their ear.






A tickle on or near their ribs.






An annoying nudge on the back of their seat with your legs.






A breath of air right on the back of their neck.






A kick in the back of their seat.

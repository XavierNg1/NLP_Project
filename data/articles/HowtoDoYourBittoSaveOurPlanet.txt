Make sure all (or most) of the lights in your house have energy-saving bulbs, and always turn off any lights that aren't needed.
Turn off your Wii, Nintendo DS, DVD player, etc. completely when they are not in use.;
, Make sure your family recycles everything possible.
 Don't throw away toys, books, CDs, etc. that you don't want or need anymore - take them to your local charity shop. If that isn't possible, see if you can recycle them or give them to a relative., For example, take along old plastic bags next time you go to the supermarket; use paper trash as scrap paper.
 Simple ways to save water include:


Turning off water while you brush your teeth, and filling a glass with water to rinse your mouth.
Using a bowl of clean water instead of running the taps to rinse plates.
Buying a water butt (a barrel for collecting rainwater, especially from drainpipes), and using this to water plants.
Taking short showers instead of baths or long showers.
 If you feel cold, put on an extra layer of clothing. If you feel hot, wear less or drink a cold beverage.
 It's easy and more effective than fertilizer.

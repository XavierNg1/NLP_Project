 Your cat produces allergens all the time, so one way you can help your allergies is to reduce the number allergens in your home. Try vacuuming at least once a week to reduce dander, which is what gives you allergies.Also, be sure to dust regularly, so you're picking up any allergens that are around your home.Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to make sure you capture allergens instead of spreading them around the room., An air purifier can trap allergens so they don't bother you. If you can only afford one, put it in your bedroom. That way, you'll have an area that gives you a break from allergies.You can also get a HEPA air filter for your air conditioner.
 Creating an area that is cat-free can help you take a break from allergens. The best place to choose is your bedroom, so that you can sleep better without allergies bothering you., Even if you ban your cat from your bedroom, dander and pet hair will build up on the soft surfaces in your home. Wash these items frequently to help prevent the buildup of dander and fur. This will help control the level of allergens in your home.

Use a vacuum cleaner and lint roller to clean soft surfaces that you cannot wash, such as your sofa.
 Hard surfaces, such as hardwood or tile floors and blinds, are less likely to harbor allergens than soft surfaces. It's best to skip thick carpets, for instance, as well as cloth curtains, as they can both trap allergens.For cloth that you need to have around, such as towels and sheets, be sure to wash them in hot water to help reduce allergens.

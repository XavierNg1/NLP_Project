 In order to do this you will have to let the two snipers at the top of the guard tower shoot you a couple of times.
 Once the snipers have shot you for a bit, cross the bridge until the Taurus Demon comes out.
 Once the Taurus Demon is on the bridge, get the snipers to start shooting you at the same time that you go behind, in front or underneath the Taurus Demon. The snipers will shoot the Taurus Demon. Keep on repeating this until the Taurus Demon is dead. It is a bit tricky to do but it's hilarious to see the Taurus Demon getting shot by his own teammates.

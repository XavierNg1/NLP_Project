 Place the tie around your neck and let the sides hang in front of you. The wide end should be on the right side of your body, and hang roughly 12 inches (30 cm) lower than the narrow end on the left.The Half Windsor is a triangular, symmetrical knot suitable for formal occasions. Larger than the Four-in-hand but less bulky than the Windsor, this can work with most neckties and collar types.Neckties made from thicker fabric will likely require a spread or wide spread collar with this knot., Bring the wide end of the tie over to your left side, crossing over the narrow end.
 Complete a loop around the narrow end and pull the wide end back to the right side.









The underside of the wide end should be visible at this point.
 Raise the wide end up to the loop of necktie at your collar. Keep it on the right side.
 Insert the wide tip down through the loop and pull it through from the left side, so it crosses under the narrow end.
 Bring the wide end back across the front and onto your right side.
 Fold the wide end up through the neck loop a second time.
 Loosen the front knot with your finger and insert the wide end. Pull it through to rest over the narrow end.
 Gently squeeze the front knot as you pull to slide the knot up and create a dimple at the front of your tie.

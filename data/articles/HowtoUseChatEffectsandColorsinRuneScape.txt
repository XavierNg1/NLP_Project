 This will not work on Runescape Classic, which is really old.;
, If this is off the syntax will not work.
 It's good to visualize what you want your text to look like. If you don't you may end up with something people can't understand.
 Use this syntax: colour:effect:text. Do not put spaces in between the code and the text, or it will not display correctly. If you like, you can specify only a colour, or only an effect - there is no obligation to use both.

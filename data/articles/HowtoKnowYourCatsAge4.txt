 As your cat ages, it will go through different stages of dental development. When your cat is relaxed and comfortable, try identifying the types of teeth it has to get an idea of how old your cat is.


The first teeth to grow in a kitten are the incisors (around 2-4 weeks) and canines (around 3-4 weeks), followed by the premolars (around 4-6 weeks).
A cat younger than around four months will not yet have its molars.
From the ages of around six months up to one year, your cat will have all of its adult teeth. At this point the cat's teeth should be white and have no signs of wear.
 As your cat ages, its teeth will start to show signs of that aging. Yellowing of the teeth can indicate that you cat is an older adult. The degree of wear and yellowing will indicate just how old your cat is likely to be.You can expect to see slight yellowing in your cat's teeth at around two years of age.
At ages three to five years old, your cat will have increased yellowing in its teeth.
Between the ages of five to ten, yellowing will be easily visible.
When your cat is ten or older it will show clear signs of yellowing, likely on all teeth.
 Another indication of age that can be seen in your cat's teeth is how worn down they are. Carefully examine your cat's teeth to look for any areas that may be worn to help you determine how old your cat might be.


Worn down teeth will have lost their points, appearing more dull than in a younger cat.
Some teeth may have the points either worn or broken off.
Generally your cat will begin to show signs of tooth wear when it is five years old.
If your cat is between five and ten years old, teeth will show clear signs of wear.
At ages of ten years and beyond, heavy wearing down of the teeth will be apparent. Some teeth may be missing at these ages.
The older a cat is, the more likely it is have to have dental tartar and gum recession. This is a vague tool for aging because how quickly the teeth become dirty depends on the cat's diet.

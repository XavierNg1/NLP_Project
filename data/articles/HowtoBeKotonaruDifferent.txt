, So, if you don't already, watch anime and read manga. And don't be afraid to watch Japanese dramas and movies, too. Even if it's rated "M for mature audiences", if you can handle it, watch/read it.
 Whether you draw, paint, write, whatever, show it off. If you don't find yourself artistic, then consider buying art that you like.
 We Kotonarus like light and fluffy, but we also like dark sides. Reading manga like Full Moon wo Sagashite, Clannad, and This Ugly Yet Beautiful World should get you off to a good start. Also check out Rumiko Takahashi's work.
 Whatever suits you.
 Kotonarus generally stay away from name brands(except Converse) and go for the cheap stuff. As I said, we like cute with a dark side. So a t-shirt with a skeleton bunny is perfect. Kotonarus are generally casual. We tend to wear colors like blues and purples, reds and pink, yellows and greens. If it is a bright color, Kotonarus usually wear a dark color with it, to mix things up. We sometimes wear skirts, as long as there not too short. Unless, of course, we find it totally cute and think it looks like the skirt from Clannad.
 Kotonarus like to keep things natural. Show off your cuteness as much as possible!

, Kotonarus can find at least one artist/band in almost every genre that we like. We usually listen to things that don't hit the radio much. The songs we listen to have a special meaning to us.
 Since most of us are still in school, we either eat the school's lunch, or pack whatever we want in a bag. We like Japanese sweets like Pocky and Yan Yan.
 Put the Japanese characters for Kotonaru on it. Fill it with things like plushies, sketchpads, your PC, anything or everything that you love.
 Keep one in that tote bag. Whatever you're into, read it. Even if the vampires sparkle.
 Friends are forever.
 Grab a friend and try it out with him/her, but if it's not them then don't force them. Let them be themselves.

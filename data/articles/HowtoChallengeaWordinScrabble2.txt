 Challenging a word in Scrabble is a way to ensure that all of the plays are actual words and no one is making up words just to score points. It is important to challenge words that seem invalid so that another player cannot gain an advantage.You may also learn new words in the process of challenging another player because some of your opponents may know obscure words that you have never encountered before.
 You can only challenge a word right after a player has placed that word. You may not wait until a few other players have taken their turns and then make the challenge. , Keep in mind that challenging a word will result in a lost turn for either you or your opponent. Therefore, you should be fairly sure that your opponent has played an invalid word before making a challenge. Otherwise, you might lose an opportunity to score points, which may result in you losing the game., It is essential to have a dictionary out when you play Scrabble so that you can use it if a word is challenged. You may not use the dictionary to look up words before they are placed. The dictionary should only be used to look up words that have been challenged. Make sure that you and your fellow players all agree on a dictionary to use for challenges.

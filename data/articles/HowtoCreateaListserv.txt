 There are 3 options for any operating system:


Listserv Classic is the first and most often used of the Listserv programs. It meets the needs of most individual users and includes email and discussion groups.
Listserv Lite is for entry-level electronic mailing lists and does not contain advanced features.
Listserv Maestro meets the needs of heavy users with a large number of subscribers.;
,


Make certain the name of the list and the email address that people will use describe the group as much as possible, such as ROADRUNNERS@LISTSERV.TAMU.EDU for recreational runners.
 Password verification will be sent to you with instructions on activating it.



A public list means that anyone can join.
If you want to create a Listserv that is private, let Listserv know when you register it. Don't join directories such as Yahoo! Groups.



Invite people to join by typing in their email addresses on the management page.
The people who receive your invitations can join or "opt in."
Other people can subscribe by sending a message to the Listserv; however you must approve membership requests.
 This allows people to subscribe or unsubscribe at any time.
,


Anyone in the Listserv can send a message unless it's a moderated list.
If you start a Listserv that is a moderated list, then you must approve messages before posting them to the electronic mailing list.



Encourage spirited discussions.
Make everyone aware of rules about what is not allowed in the Listserv.

Choose "Subscribers" or the Subscriber button to add or delete subscribers or change any of their information.
"Bulk op." is for managing bulk operations, but be careful. When you use this command, you cannot undo it.
The Commands button can be used to manage your electronic mailing list or enter Listserv commands.

 A common misconception regarding bread is that the color of the loaf is directly related to the nutritional value of the product—the darker the loaf, the healthier the bread. This is not always the case, however. Always read the ingredient list to determine if a product is truly nutritious and made of whole wheat or if it simply contains artificial coloring agents.


Many dark loaves, such as pumpernickel and rye, are often made with enriched flours and receive their dark hues from molasses or caramel.
White bread is not always unhealthy. Many manufacturers are now producing white breads made from white whole wheat flours., Bread companies use certain phrases to make consumers believe that their product is more nutritious than it truly is. These phrases often include the following words: “country,” “home,” and “harvest.” Since these phrases are not regulated by the FDA, bread companies may deceptively depict the production process.


Don’t let these words prevent you from scanning the ingredient list., Multigrain sounds incredibly nutritious, but the term’s vagueness makes it rather deceptive. A multigrain product does not necessarily contain a variety of whole grains. More often than not, multigrain products only contain refined grains.

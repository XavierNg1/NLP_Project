 Visit a website like Healthgrades.com to read what other patients have to say about your chosen allergist. There is often information available about wait times, how easy it is to get an appointment, and whether people like their allergist and treatment. These are sometimes called “patient satisfaction surveys.”Choose an allergist who is Board Certified to ensure they have the proper training.
 Sometimes the easiest way to find an allergist is by word-of-mouth. Ask a friend, family member, or co-worker who suffers from allergies if they see a professional who they know and trust. Often, you can see the same doctor; if not, you can probably see another professional within the same organization., Most Board Certified allergists can handle a variety of allergy problems, but it may help you to work with someone who has special experience with your issue. Whether you suffer from severe seasonal allergies, food allergies, or need a particular procedure, choose an allergist with experience in what you need., When you locate a provider you want to work with, set up a consultation to meet with them. You want to be sure that you feel comfortable with your allergist, that they listen to your needs, and that they seem invested in getting to know you. Only move forward with them if you feel comfortable with their style – don’t be afraid to request someone else!

 In a small bowl, beat the yolk from 1 egg. Next, add 6 tablespoons of plain yogurt, and use a spoon to mix until the ingredients are fully combined.Egg yolk is rich in proteins and fats, so it helps strengthen and moisturize dry, brittle hair.
In addition to protein, yogurt contains lactic acid, which helps remove dirt and product buildup while also moisturizing the hair.;
, When the egg yolk and yogurt are mixed, smooth the mixture over your hair, paying special attention to the ends. Let the mask sit on your hair for approximately 20 minutes so the ingredients have time to penetrate.While the mask is sitting on your hair, it’s a good idea to put a shower cap over your head. That will help warm the mask so your hair absorbs the proteins more easily.
 After 20 minutes, wash the mask out of your hair with plain water. Work carefully to ensure that you remove all of the mixture. Next, use your normal shampoo and conditioner to wash your hair as you normally would.When you’re rinsing the mask from your hair, use cool water. If you use warm or hot water, it may cook the egg yolk, making it more difficult to rinse it.

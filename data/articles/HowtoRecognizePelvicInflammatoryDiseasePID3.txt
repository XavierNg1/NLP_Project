 If you are sexually active, visit with your OBGYN each year and request STD testing. PID is very often linked with two widespread bacterial STDs, gonorrhea and chlamydia. A quick pelvic exam and a few labs can let you know whether or not you have these infections, which can make it possible to treat them before they develop into PID., Having PID once makes it far more likely that you will contract it again. Basically, it means that your body is vulnerable to some of the types of bacteria which cause PID. So, if you’ve gotten it before, make sure to keep a close eye on any possible symptoms, using your past experiences as your guide., Younger, sexually active women have an increased odds of getting PID. Their internal reproductive organs are not fully developed, which makes them easier targets for bacteria and STDs. They are also more likely to “skip” regular OBGYN appointments., With every additional sex partner, your risk of getting PID or an STD grows. This is especially the case if you have sex without using a condom, as birth control will not protect you against STD and other infections. By reducing your number of partners, and having them all go for regular STD tests, you can improve your own health., This is when you shoot water or another cleansing solution into your vaginal area in the hopes of making it cleaner. The problem here is that you can push nasty bacteria up into your reproductive organs, including your cervix, where they can take hold and give you PID. Douching also kills off natural, good oils and chemicals living in the outer vaginal area., Most doctors will send you home with antibiotics following an IUD procedure, to minimize the possibility of infection. However, it is important to keep a close eye on your body for the first month or so following getting your new IUD, as this is the time when PID is most likely to develop.

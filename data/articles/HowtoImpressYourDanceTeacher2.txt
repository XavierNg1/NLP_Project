 To convey your willingness to learn, try every move taught in your dance class, regardless of how difficult it may be. Do not allow your concerns about looking silly stop you from attempting and repeating certain movements - struggling with these movements will still convey your commitment to learning and impress your teacher. Giving up on your efforts to master a movement may convey disinterest and will likely leave a negative impression on your dance teacher., Once you are in dance class, give the teacher your full attention. Put away your phone and avoid talking to other students while the dance teacher is instructing you; this is rude and counter-productive to the flow of the class. Listen clearly to the teacher's instructions and emulate their movements as much as possible. Avoid holding up the class by slowing down a routine or missing a group transition in a choreography., It is important to approach dance class with an optimistic attitude. Dancers tend to be highly tuned to other people's energies, and a negative attitude can distract your teacher and classmates. Even if you're tired or having a bad day, make the effort to smile, persevere, and do your best in class.

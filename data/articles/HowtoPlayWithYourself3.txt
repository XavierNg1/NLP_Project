 If you're stuck on a long shopping trip, you're there with someone else who's doing things that don't interest you. Excuse yourself by telling the other person you're going to have a look around, and agree on a meeting place and time to get back together. Head off and distract yourself any way you can. Even when nothing seems interesting, you can usually find things to look at. Try reading nutrition labels or looking at brand icons in a supermarket, for example.


Don't forget, you can also go outside the building and see what the back lot looks like.
Be sure the person you're with hears and understands you when you set a place and time. Ask them to recite it back to you so you know you're both on the same page about the location in particular.
If you're young enough, you can usually get away with sitting down in a corner and actually playing with die-cast cars or other small toys inside a store. Don't expect to get away with this if you're a teenager or older, though.
 Between phones and handheld game consoles like the Nintendo 3DS, there are many games available to play on the go. Prepare ahead of time and bring along an alternate game or two in case you get stuck on one. If you can't find a good place to sit and play your game, check for benches outside the front of the building, or chairs in the back near restrooms and fitting rooms.


As with console games at home, don't forget that there are several older handheld systems available for relatively little money, most of which had many fun games made for them. You don't have to buy a top-of-the-line system to have fun.

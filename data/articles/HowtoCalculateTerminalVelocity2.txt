 This should be measured in grams or kilograms, in the metric system.


If you are using the imperial system, remember that pounds is not actually a unit of mass, but of force. The unit of mass in the imperial system is the pound-mass (lbm), which under the gravitational force on the surface of the earth would experience a force of 32 pound-force (lbf). For example, if a person weighs 160 pounds on earth, that person is actually feeling 160 lbf, but their mass is 5 lbm.
 Close enough to the earth to encounter air resistance, this acceleration is 9.8 meters per second squared, or 32 feet per second squared.
 The force with which the falling object is being pulled down equals the object's mass times acceleration due to gravity, or F = MA. This number, multiplied by two, goes in the top of the terminal velocity formula.


In the imperial system, this is the lbf of the object, the number that is commonly called weight. It is more properly the mass in lbm times 32 feet per second squared. In the metric system, the force is the mass in grams times 9.8 meters per second squared.

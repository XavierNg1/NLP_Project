,, After you click This, the page will automatically move down to Choose Trigger Channel. From there, select "Feed."

,,


Many blogs and websites use WordPress CMS, so in order to find the feed, just add "/feed" or "/feeds" to the tail of the URL to retrieve the posts from the home page.

Example: If the home page URL is http://www.crawlerguys.com then the feed will be at http://www.crawlerguys.com/feed. This will fetch the entire updates from the blog.


If you want to receive SMS updates only from a particular category from your favorite blog or website, then select that category and just add "/feed" to the tail of that URL.

Example: http://www.telecomclue.com/category/os/android/ is a sub category in telecomclue.com. To get the SMS alerts from android category, put "http://www.telecomclue.com/category/os/android/feed" in the Feed URL. When the android category is updated, you will receive an SMS talking about the new post in that category.


Donâ€™t worry if a blog is with Blogger, IFTTT also supports Blogger channel.

 Oftentimes, this will be a closed-in area such as a closet or a corner of a bedroom. If a mother has chosen an area that is out of the way and not dangerous (such as near dangerous chemicals, etc.), then it’s best to work around the mother’s choices. If the mother is calm and happy, then her pups are likely to sleep better. And if the mother’s not happy with the place, she’s more likely to move them and that will certainly disrupt their sleep., You’ll want to make sure the materials you use are safe for puppies, as puppies are more susceptible to toxins at an early age. If you use blankets, you may want to use older ones, as the puppies may stain them. If you use padding, make sure to change it every couple of days or so., You’ll want the mother and the puppies to be able to stretch out comfortably in their space. This will help the mother is at ease. You’ll also want to make sure the mother can get out of the box when needed.

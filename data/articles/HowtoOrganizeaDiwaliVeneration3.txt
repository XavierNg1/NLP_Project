 You can decorate the whole place with flowers.(plastic or fake flowers are the best as they won't dry up as the real ones). Flowers bring in sweet scent and beauty to the room or item you are decorating it with., Buy enough diyas and decorate the place nicely so that the whole place shines! This is really important because Diwali means light over dark, so diyas are pretty important during this occasion.
 Rangoli is also the main attraction to a Diwali veneration. Make lovely rangolis all over the entrance and inside the prayer hall near the gods idols. They attract more people and also increase the beauty of the surroundings. It is not only the main attraction, but also a sacred tradition in India. If a home doesn't have a rangoli, Goddess Laxmi won't enter the respective home in the form of wealth.

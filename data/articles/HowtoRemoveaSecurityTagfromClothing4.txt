 Do this ten or so times, until it loosens the pin a bit.
 The nail should be bigger than the tag, and the head of the nail should be at least as wide as a penny.
 Hold the long plastic part of the tag to the side.
 Without applying too much force, repeatedly strike down on the ink cartridge until it pops open. You may have to hit it twenty or more times to get it right.


Be careful not to hit it too hard, or the tag will be more likely to burst open.

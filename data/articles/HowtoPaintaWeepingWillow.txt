 For the weeping willow, we need a light, but not lime, green. So, mix yellow and blue until you get dark green, then add a quarter of a teaspoon of yellow. Then mix brown and white together until you get a grey, then add half a teaspoon of red. You will now have brown. Mix a darker green. Blue and Yellow. And a light blue, dark blue mixed with a quarter teaspoon of white.;
, Like in the picture. The grass should be a flat rectangle, and then, with a smaller brush, tiny flecks over the top, like a green, shaggy rug.
 And then, when at the top, off comes the sparks. Paint quick, detailed lines around 4–5 centimeter (1.6–2.0 in) long every time. These are the branches, curve them downwards.
 Detailed flecks of green, all up the branch, perhaps one or two floating to the ground in the wind. Finished!

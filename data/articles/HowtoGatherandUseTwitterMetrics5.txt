 Let's say you're tweeting about a particular blog post. Create a short URL under your domain that redirects to the actual blog post. Then see how much traffic that intermediate URL gets.
 To see how many clicks a link is getting through Twitter, add a plus sign (+) to the end of the bit.ly URL. For example, J5JCZ links to How to Unclog a Toilet. If you go to J5JCZ+ (note the plus sign) you will see traffic stats for that link. If you create an account with bit.ly, you can create your own custom link and track its performance separately from other bit.ly links pointing to the same page.

 Use this phrase if someone does something nice for you. Also say it if you’re given something. Add the word большое (bal-SHO-ye) if you want to say “thank you very much.” The full phrase is спасибо большое (spAH-see-ba bal-SHO-ye)., Respond to спасибо with пожалуйста. This word is always appropriate and appreciated. Note that пожалуйста also means “please” if you’re asking someone to do something. For example, use it as “please” if you’re asking someone to give you something or tell you directions., Run it together so it sounds like one word. Use this instead of пожалуйста in informal situations. Only use it with people you know., For example, you’ll only use “I’m sorry” if you’re really broken up about wronging someone. Note that both of these phrases have formal and informal forms.Use the polite form извините (eez-vee-nEEt-ye) or the informal извини (eez-vee-nEE) for “excuse me.”
Tell someone “I’m sorry” using простите (pra-stEEt-ye) for the formal or прости (pra-stEE) for the informal.
 Never ask it with someone in authority. This can be considered rude.


Expect a response like хорошо (kha-ra-shOH) for “good.”
Both нормально (nor-mAHl-na) and так себя (tahk sib-YA) mean “okay.”
Ask “how are you?” formally with the phrase как живете (kahk zhee-vyOHt-ye)?.

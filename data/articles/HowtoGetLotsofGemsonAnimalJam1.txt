Open up your calculator, or get one yourself. Using the calculator is good for keeping track of the gems you have and get, but this is optional.

If you get first prize you can get 200 gems depending on how many people are in the match, so make sure the match has at least 7 players. If the glitch happens, where every jammer gets in first place, your in luck! You get 200 gems, like it says up near the top of the paragraph.

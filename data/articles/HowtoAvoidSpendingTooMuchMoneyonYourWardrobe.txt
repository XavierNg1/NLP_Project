 Buy clothing that accentuates your eyes, hair, skin tone and figure. Buy clothing only if it's exceptional and coordinates well with your existing wardrobe.;
, Avoid impulse shopping. Don't buy things because they're on sale. Don't let your friends convince you to buy something you don't want. You should only buy things you need, not things you want. Come back to an item after you've had time to think it over.
 Leave credit cards at home. Keep your price limits in mind.
 Know exactly what you're looking for and stick to a list. So you only buy what you need. Don't spend your spare time browsing through the malls.
 Buy them during sales at high end stores, so that they'll fit well and hold up to frequent washing.

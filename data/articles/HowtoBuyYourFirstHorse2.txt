 However, horses that have already been trained and are familiar with people will cause the least problems for you. Younger horses, on the other hand, can be rambunctious, finicky, and difficult to handle.


If you’re buying a horse for a child, a good rule of thumb is that the age of the child and the age of the horse should add up to 20. For instance, if your child is 10, the horse should also be about 10.
 An experienced horse -- one that has been ridden and trained already -- will be more amenable to a new owner. Avoid buying a horse advertised as “green” or “in need of finishing.” These are horse-riding euphemisms for inexperienced horses.
 A gelding (a castrated male horse) might be your best bet. Horse owners find that they are more predictable than mares. A mare could also make a good first horse, but they tend to become difficult to handle during menstruation. Evaluate each animal based on its own merits. Whatever you do, never select a stallion for your first horse, as they tend to be too wild and unruly for novice horse-riders.If a mare is advertised as “in foal,” it means they are pregnant. Do not buy a pregnant mare, as a foal will be an extra expense for you, and you won’t be able to ride the mare until some time has passed after it gives birth.

 Try to leave at least three inches of extra thread so that you can successfully secure a stitch without losing the end of the thread.






;
, Keep the garment on a flat surface (like a table) so that you donâ€™t stitch into another layer of fabric, such as your own clothing.
 You should also be able to see the length of the nearby stitch you just made.
 Insert the needle under the nearby stitch and pull it under the stitch until it forms a loop.









Note: For single or double thread you can alternatively make a loop with only the string itself. Holding the thread in one hand and the needle in the other, loop the thread over the needle and pull the needle through the loop. Then slowly pull the loop down until it is flush with the fabric and tighten it. This will make a knot., Slowly pull the needle through the loop and pull it tight. This will cause the beginning of a knot.









Note: With double thread, you can also take the thread out of the needle (leaving you with both strands of thread hanging from the back of the fabric) and fold the left side of the thread over and back under the right side several times like you are tying your shoes (just the first step of shoe-tying, not the loop parts).
Repeat this step several times to ensure the knot is secure.
 Cut the extra thread on the outside of the knot so the back of the fabric looks clean and uncluttered. Use very sharp scissors.

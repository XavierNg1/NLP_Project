 This is the easiest way to preserve garlic for later use. Simply peel the garlic cloves, put them in a plastic bag, and stick them in your freezer.


Chop garlic before freezing to make it easier to throw into a dish quickly.
Freezing chopped garlic in oil prevents it from freezing solid, which will allow you to scoop only appropriate amounts out when you're ready to use it.
Using Olive oil can make your garlic last longer than any other oil.
 Use a food dehydrator, or bake at a low temperature on drying racks in your oven.
 This slightly alters the flavor, but it drastically increases the shelf life.
 This is an easier way of pickling your garlic, and it will keep almost indefinitely. Simply submerge peeled cloves of garlic in red or white wine vinegar and add a tablespoon of salt for each cup of vinegar you used. If you want, add dried herbs like red pepper flakes or oregano to flavor. The garlic will keep as long as it remains submerged in the vinegar.

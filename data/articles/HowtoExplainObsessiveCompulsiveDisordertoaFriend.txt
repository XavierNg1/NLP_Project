 Tell them an obsession is not the same as an obsession with a movie or an obsession with a cute celebrity. Otherwise, if you say "I have an obsession with hurting someone," it may come across terribly wrong. Tell them that in OCD, an obsession is an unwanted, intrusive thought and intense fear that the person tries to dismiss the best they can. Some "obsessions," or fears, in OCD include germs and contamination, an overinflated sense of responsibility, or accidentally causing harm to a loved one.;
, Many people say, "Oh I'm so OCD. I love to clean." Tell them that compulsions are not done for enjoyment; they are done to prevent something bad from happening or to find relief. Also explain that many people with obsessive compulsive disorder are not efficient cleaners. Explain you get no (real) pleasure from obsessions, such as the urge to clean.
 The book "OCD: The Guide for the Newly Diagnosed," authored by Michael A. Thompkins, is a good one. It may help them understand what it is really like for you.
 People with OCD are not delusional; they know that their obsessions/compulsions don't make sense, but they do them just to be safe.
 Remind them that people with OCD are not dangerous and are the least likely out of the entire population to ever commit a crime.
 Seek out people who can support and help you cope, rather than those who don't work to understand your disorder.

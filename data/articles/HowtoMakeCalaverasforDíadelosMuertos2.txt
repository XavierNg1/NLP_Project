 Combine the water and the sugar in a saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium heat until a thick sugar syrup is formed.


Once the concoction starts to boil, turn the heat down a bit. If it's not thickening, add a bit more sugar.
 Pour the syrup onto a clean cookie sheet, and stir to cool the syrup. Be careful â€”- the liquid sugar is very hot and very sticky.
 Using a spatula, keep turning and mixing the sugar syrup as it cools. Make sure you work all the syrup on the sheet, so that no one bit cools too quickly.


Continue blending and folding until the sugar reaches a play-dough consistency. Form small balls of sugar between your hands.
Squeeze and pinch the ball into a skull shape. Using your fingers, add depressions for the eye sockets and mouth.
Let the calavera cool.

 If you're using old glass jars, make sure they're free of food particles and that the labels on the front of the jars are completely removed. Even if you bought brand-new containers, give them a rinse to remove dust and other particles from inside them. Dry the containers thoroughly before proceeding.
 The tiny metal discs at the ends of the wicks should have a sticky backing. Remove the paper from the backing of one of the wick anchors. Place the anchor inside a candle container and affix it to the center of the container's base. Press it down to ensure it will stay in place, and let the top of the wick drape over the lip of the container. Repeat with the remaining wicks and containers.









If your wick anchors don't have sticky backing, affix them to the containers with wax. Light a taper candle and drip a bit of wax on the bottom an anchor, then quickly press the anchor into the center of a container's base. Repeat with the remaining wicks and containers.
If your wicks didn't come with anchors, you can tie them to metal washers and use wax to affix the washers to the candle containers.
 Using one pencil for each candle wick, gently lift each wick and wrap the end around the center of a pencil until you can rest the pencil horizontally across the opening of the candle container and the wick is slightly taut. This will hold the wicks in position when you pour the wax into the containers.
 When the wax is melted, you'll need the containers to be nearby so you can pour it right away, before it gets hard. Set the containers on your counter or kitchen table over some newspaper or wax paper to avoid getting wax on the room's surfaces.

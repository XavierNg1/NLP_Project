 Rulers that are entirely composed of metal work well, as do wooden rulers with metal strips. Make sure that the metal used in the ruler is magnetic by practice sticking a magnet to it.

If you only have a few spices, one ruler might be enough. For slightly larger collections, use more rulers.
 Since this rack and the small number of spices it can hold will be fairly light, you can probably get away with using strong craft glue instead of more permanent bonding agent. Cut the strip so that it covers the length of the ruler., Use craft glue to adhere it. The surface you choose is a matter of convenience more than anything else. You can choose a small patch of wall, like the wall under a cupboard or behind the sink, or you can even use the inside of a cabinet door or the side of the cabinet itself. Avoid places that get too warm, however, since spices can be damaged by prolonged heat.

 Instead of reacting to your emotions in a negative situation, take a moment to observe your physical response. As you observe yourself, take note of how the situation is making you feel. What physical reactions are you having to the situation?For example, if someone calls you a name, you might notice that your cheeks feel hot and your heart rate has increased.;
, After you have noted your physical reaction to the situation, take a moment to acknowledge your emotional response. What emotions are you feeling as a result of the situation?For example, if someone calls you a name, you might notice that you feel angry and embarrassed.
 After you notice your feelings, let them pass without reacting to them. It's perfectly okay to put off feelings for the moment to deal with a situation, then do your emotional processing afterwards.Letting the feeling pass will allow you to respond with more assertiveness and less emotion. It may be difficult to put your initial feeling aside at first, but it will get easier with practice.
 Once you have detached yourself from the situation, take a moment to decide how to respond in an assertive, unemotional way. Or, don't respond at all!If you do not feel capable of responding without emotion, ask to be excused from the situation. For example, you might say, “Hold on a second. I have to use the restroom.” Then go to the restroom for a few minutes and use the time to compose yourself.

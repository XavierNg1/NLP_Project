 If you are new to the Call of Duty series you most likely did not choose your playing style. For example, maybe you want to be good at medium to long ranges? You would start out with an assault rifle class (or if you're level 4, make one.) or maybe you'd like a short to medium range SMG to boot. There is also the medium to long range heavy machine guns, which are slightly slow but well, dangerous. Or would you like to play it close and deadly with a shotgun, or the opposite, a sniper for those long range well earned kills?;
, First thing you need to do is get the gun you want to get gold second, you will need to have shock charges and C4, Claymore, or a Bouncing Betty. If you stay in a corner or a house place these at the doors, and windows. When an enemy gets in fire away!

, How do you want your scores to end up like? Do you want to be defensive and have a positive kill death ratio? Or do you want to push the enemy back with a level to low kill death ratio by being aggressive? Or do you want to change it up now and then? (recommended you change it up)

, Now you're level four, a way to go using those preset guns. Maybe try the all purpose assault rifle. If you're not playing black ops, choose the gun that's best for you and use it. If you're playing black ops, well, you're going to waste money if you do not read up about the weapon you're using. Generally starting out, you're a low level, and you're new, use an accurate gun, and keep using guns that fit your needs. When you start to play better, use perks that make your gun better. When you unlock things, use them and use other varieties of those things and find what fits your need.
 Get an accurate weapon, any that suits you, and pick the perks that make it better, like as a sniper, stopping power and some claymores - that also works for camping tactics with the assault rifles. Always find the guns and perks that suit your needs and get in the field and kill.

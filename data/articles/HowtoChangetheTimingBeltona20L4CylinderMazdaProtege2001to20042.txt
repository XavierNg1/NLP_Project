 One of the 10mm bolt that will be removed later was covered (hidden) but is now "found" under that hose.;
, Or you could get them up from the ports if you find a way to use a piece of hose inserted snugly over each spark plug after each is unscrewed.


Do this carefully to keep from breaking or dropping the spark plugs especially if you want to reuse them.
, You use a small but powerful impact wrench to loosen it.

With the spark plugs out, you would then reconnect the battery for just the next few moments to cause a very little "bump" of the starter motor by a momentary bump of a "remote push-button starter switch" or by wiggling the ignition switch to "nudge and thump" the pulley bolt a very small amount (bump) while a socket wrench (not held by hand or foot) is lodged onto the bolt as explained below.Caution: do not hold the wrench by hand if you are power bumping it loose with the starter motor. To do that position a breakover wrench with about 2.5ft (75cm) cheater pipe (like 1 or 1.5 inch steel conduit tubing) extending it and positioned at about a 45 degree angle down toward the front of the car to be held firmly against the floor or earth, blocked in place with large stones, or by being inserted in an opening of a concrete block and blocked in and about by heavy toolboxes to keep the cheater from sliding out or from side to side -- but no hands or feet trying to hold it.Bump the ignition switch (turn momentarily) to make starter motor "bump."
Then see whether it loosened the bolt--but if not then check that its still on correctly and lined up and try it again. It may loosen on the first two or three tries, when it loosens enough you'll probably hear a something like a little "zinging/whizzing" sound. So don't have loud music/talk, etc. -- beware, aware.Caution: Disconnect the negative battery terminal again after this technique so your engine can not be accidentally "bumped" or turned away from TDC by the starter motor in error.

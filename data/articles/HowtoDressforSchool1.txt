 When you wake up in the morning, all you have to do is wash your face. If you need your morning shower to help wake up, go ahead and take it, but try to just wash your body, and leave your hair dry to save time.;
, Go through your wardrobe, and pull out the clothes you want to wear. Then, decide what accessories or shoes you want to pair with your outfit. This will save you from trying to decide what matches in the morning. Also, it will keep you from frantically searching for a certain top or missing shoe in the morning. Your outfit will look more put together, and you will have less stress in the morning.
 You may have stayed up late, but you need to avoid hitting the snooze button. The longer you stay in bed, the less time you have to get ready. It may be tempting, but you will regret it when you are trying to look good for the day.


Try to give yourself at least thirty minutes in the morning to get ready.
The best way to feel refreshed in the morning, and be ready to get out of bed, is to get plenty of sleep each night. Try to set a bedtime routine that allows you to get at least eight hours of sleep every night.

 Fruit that is over ripened will deteriorate quickly as it has already released much of the chemicals that cause the fruit to break down. Fruit that is under ripened will not have developed all of its sweetness, nutritional value and juice content. Properly ripened fruit will keep longer.


Unlike other fruits, citrus fruits do not continue to ripen once they have been picked. So it is important that they be ripe right off of the tree.Ripened fruit will have very bright and vibrant colors. A fully ripened citrus fruit will have reached the fullness of its color. Dull looking fruit can indicate over ripeness and oranges with an abundance of greenish skin can mean that the fruit is under ripened.
A bit of green on the skin of oranges and lemons is perfectly fine. These tend to keep the longest and will be perfect for storing.;
, Once a fruit has been picked, it gradually begins to break down. Much of the fruit in grocery stores have already been transported and stored for a week or more. Your best bet is to obtain the fruit as soon as possible after it has been harvested.


Farmers markets, as well as other markets that sell locally harvested produce tend to offer fresher citrus fruits due to the fact that they are often delivered straight from the harvest.
 If you are picking the fruit from the tree yourself, properly ripened fruit should be easily clipped from the tree with very little resistance. Any struggle to pull the fruit from the tree means that it isnâ€™t quite ready to pick. By determining its freshness right from the tree, you will stand a good chance at finding the ideal fruit for storage.

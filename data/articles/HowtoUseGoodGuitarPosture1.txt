 Proper guitar posture begins with sitting straight. Your back should be straight up to prevent fatigue, and your feet should be resting on the floor about a foot (30 cm) apart from each other. The ideal chair height should leave your thighs roughly parallel to the floor.;
, To begin positioning the guitar, rest the waist of the guitar on your right thigh. Keep the guitar balanced by resting your right forearm over the guitar's lower bout.


The "waist" of a guitar is the narrowest part of the body. On either side of the guitar's waist are the upper and lower bouts - the protruding curves of the body.
 Your left hand should be able to comfortable curl underneath the fretboard, with each of your fingers able to access the strings. If you develop a pain in your wrist, you should angle the fretboard higher so that your wrist does not have to bend as far.


Do not use your fretting hand to support the fretboard. If you remove your left hand from the guitar neck, it should remain in position without dipping towards the ground.

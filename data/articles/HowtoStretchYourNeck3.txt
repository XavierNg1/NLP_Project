 Weak or tight muscles can worsen your posture and fail to properly support your neck. Working on these may reduce the chance of the neck pain recurring. Once you can perform these exercises without pain, schedule them every other day. The day off is important to give your muscles time to rebuild., Stand against a wall or doorjamb. Place your feet about 3 inches (7.5 cm) out from the base of the wall.You may sit against a straight-backed chair instead, if it has a headrest.Take advantage of this when you have a moment during a long drive.
 Allow your chin to drop down toward your throat. This should stretch the back of your neck, and tighten the small muscles around your throat.


Feel the large muscles on the front of your neck. If they are tense, lift your head again and lower your chin more slowly. The large muscles should stay relaxed, while the small muscles between them should tighten., Without raising your chin, move your head back so it touches the wall.


If this causes pain, pull your head back as far as you can without pain. This is a sign of forward head posture, which you can correct with other exercise and lifestyle changes.
 Hold this position for ten seconds, then relax. Repeat this ten times, then stop. You can perform this exercise several times a day.


After you practice this exercise, you may not need to have a wall or headrest behind you.
 Here's one final set of exercise that can strengthen your neck and nearby muscles.While you can't try this one on the go, some people find it easier than the exercise above:


Lie down on a firm surface, with a rolled up towel supporting your neck.
Gently bring your chin down toward your throat. Keep the back of your head against the floor, and the back of your neck against the towel. Repeat several times.
If you can do so without pain, repeat this same nodding motion while lifting the back of your head off the floor. Do not lift your neck off the towel.

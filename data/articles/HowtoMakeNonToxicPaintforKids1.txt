 Before creating paint, it's wise to have bottles already set aside to store it with. Ketchup bottles are a perfect choice in this regard, as they're designed to be easily squirtable. When you've used up the original contents, clean it out thoroughly with water and dish soap. Dry out the insides with a wash cloth and set it aside while you get your paint prepared.;
, This should result in a fluid, colourless paste.


You can do this by placing the cups in a large Ziploc bag and shaking thoroughly, although stirring in a bowl will yield the most control., Once your flour paste has been stirred sufficiently, add a food colouring that matches the colour of paint you want. Continue adding food colouring and mixing it in until the paste is as colourful as you want the paint to be.


Alternatively, you can do this by pouring the mixture into different bags filled with food colouring. This way, you can make your essential mixture in one go, and create several different types of paint in the process., Once everything has been added to your satisfaction, mix it all together thoroughly with a spatula until the homemade paint is consistent throughout. Paint that hasn't been stirred properly will clump and be harder to properly use.
 Take a funnel and insert the nozzle inside one of your empty ketchup bottles. Next, take the bowl with your flour paste turned paint and pour it in slowly. Rake in the remnants into the funnel with a spatula if there's a slowdown effect with the trickle.
 When you've finished making a particular colour of paint, wash out the funnel and other supplies thoroughly before moving onto the next colour. That way, you will minimize the risk of the leftover traces affecting the current paint you're making.

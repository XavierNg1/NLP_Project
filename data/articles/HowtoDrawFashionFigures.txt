, Notice how thin the figure is and how long the legs are compared to "normal" human drawing.
 You don't need to add in too much detail on the face or hands. You're welcome to add hair if desired, but it's by no means necessary. Keep in mind that your drawing must serve the purpose of highlighting the clothes.
 Think of the figure as a mannequin.
 Ink or paint works the best. Wait a while before erasing the guidelines.

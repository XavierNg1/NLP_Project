 Expect wool to be naturally repellant towards dirt. Also bear in mind that rigorous washing can actually damage it. Save yourself some time and trouble. Unless something catastrophic happened to your blanket, always try the easiest methods (like air-cleaning and brushing) first to see if they do the job before moving on to something tougher., Choose somewhere indoors with a lot of air circulation to hang it. Set up some fans to get the air moving if needed. Hold your blanket up and give it a thorough shaking to dislodge any dirt or dust clinging to it (or do this outside if you'd rather not vacuum the floor afterward). Then hang it so the air currents can sweep along the wool and blow away the dirt and dust.Avoid hanging it up outside if the sun is out. Direct exposure to the sun can cause pronounced fading in colors.
Do not use heat sources (like space heaters, hair dryers, or even the sun) to speed up the process. Excess heat can dry your blanket out more than desired and damage the fibers.
 Spread the blanket out on the floor and smooth it out so itâ€™s flat. Use a soft-bristle brush for fabrics to brush out dirt. Work lengthwise down the blanket and always brush in just one direction.Brushing in multiple directions can weaken the wool fibers and wear your blanket out.
Fabric brushes can be found with other laundry goods in most stores, or you can find them online.

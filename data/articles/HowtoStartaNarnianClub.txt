   Read the books through and through.  Pick apart the chapters and really understand what it is saying to you.;
,  It is a magical land that some people are enthusiastic to learn and talk about.  You can find kids at school, friends on the internet, or ask you BFF.  Then, set a meeting time.-Lunch table,-Park,-Someone's house....etc.
  Maybe you can start out as a dwarf, and work your way up and up until you're at Peter.  Don't have an Aslan level, he is to awesome to have you be his equal.  Make small badges such as soda caps or lids with your current rank written on them.      Earn higher and higher ranks by learning more and more about the books, and doing activities.
  Here are some ideas, but feel free to make up your own.


Plan a battle( have the person draw their battle line up on some paper, give them different animals and creatures they can use.  Have them line them up in the best strategy).
"Talk" to an animal.  Try to get it to understand, go on a mission to find a talking pet.
Try to find ways to get to Narnia.
Make a "banquet" fit for a king (king's that it)

,  Let the person moving up a rank come to the front and receive their badge.
  It will move you and nourish your love for it.
  Here is a sample one:Us, the Children of Aslan, pledge to always believe.  And learn more of the books, keeping our faith and love for them strong.
  It can be your very own "Aslan's How".

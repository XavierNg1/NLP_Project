 Yellow leaves, and sometimes red spots, indicate that the plant is getting too much sunlight. If you see any red or yellow on your nepenthes, check for burned leaves on the areas of the plant that face the sun. After you reduce light exposure, you’ll usually find new and normal-colored leaves beginning to grow soon after., Poor coloration can also mean the light exposure isn’t adequate. You plant may refuse to make pitchers if it’s not getting enough light, although occasionally this can be caused by inadequate humidity levels., It’s normal for leaves and pitchers to start dying around fall or winter. The pitchers only last a couple of months, about the length of one season. Then they age, turn brown and die. Prune dying pitchers off your plant by cutting them off at the end of their tendrils.Remove browned and dead leaves.
Avoid pruning off more than 30% of your plant’s foliage at one time.

 Do not spend everything you have saved; always leave a little aside to start off the next round of savings.
 Subtract it from the thing you want written in your notebook, or what you're saving up to.
 Like greatest to least or least to greatest, your choice. This will help you to avoid spontaneous purchases that you haven't saved for, and helps keep your savings in check.


When buying, look for quality. Is the item durable, will it be something you will use for a long time?
Is the item you're buying a fad? If so, reconsider whether it is worth breaking your savings for.
 Keep a record of your savings, what you've spent and update with a new goal.

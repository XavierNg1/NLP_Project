 Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.


The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered;
Those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to others.;
, You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men.


But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one.
You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed.
 And then examine it by those rules which you have, and first, and chiefly, by this:


Whether it concerns the things which are in our own control, or those which are not;
If it concerns anything not in our control, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.
,


The wise will start each day with the thought…
Fortune gives us nothing which we can really own.
Nothing, whether public or private, is stable;
The destinies of men, no less than those of cities, are in a whirl.
Whatever structure has been reared by a long sequence of years, at the cost of great toil and through the great kindness of the gods, is scattered and dispersed in a single day. No, he who has said ‘a day’ has granted too long a postponement to swift misfortune; an hour, an instant of time, suffices for the overthrow of empires.
How often have cities in Asia, how often in Achaia, been laid low by a single shock of earthquake? How many towns in Syria, how many in Macedonia, have been swallowed up? How often has this kind of devastation laid Cyprus in ruins?

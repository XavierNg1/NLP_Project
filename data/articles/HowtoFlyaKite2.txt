 This wind speed works for most kites, although medium speed winds are ideal. It will be difficult to fly a kite in winds that are either slower or faster than this speed. Check the weather app on your phone or computer to see how fast the winds are blowing on a given day.You can also look at the tops of trees, bushes, and the leaves to see how fast the wind is blowing; for example, when the wind is able to move leaves off of the ground, the flying conditions are ideal.
 Parks, the beach, and open fields are great places to fly a kite. Try to avoid flying your kite near power lines, buildings, roads, airports, and trees. Additionally, if you are flying a dual line kite, create distance between yourself and other people in the park, and make sure others know to stand behind you.Remember that the more space you have, the more line you can let out and the higher your kite will fly.
 The electricity in rain clouds is attracted to wet kite lines. To avoid getting shocked, never fly your kite in a rain or thunderstorm.

 Melee is probably the toughest and longest way to complete the fight caves. You are going to want at least 80+ in all melee skills, as well as 43 prayer at the minimum. Buy yourself 2 prayer renewal flasks, 5 prayer potion flasks, 10 saradomin brews, 10 super restores, and as many purple sweets as you can buy. The purple sweets only take up 1 inventory space, and stack, so you could have as many as you would like. Buy yourself the chaotic rapiers, which cost 300k tokens in Dungeoneering. Optionally a Saradomin or Armadyl godsword is a second option. Your armor will be Bandos armor, or Torva armor if you can afford it.
 You are going to want Protect from magic, melee, and ranged as three consecutive buttons near the end of your bar. This allows for the quickest prayer switching. The abilities you are going to use vary depending on the weapon for maximum efficiency.

If using a godsword, have your abilities as dismember, cleave, smash, sever, and fury.
If using dual rapiers, have your abilities as Decimate, havoc, dismember, sever, slice, and fury.

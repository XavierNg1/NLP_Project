 If you want to join a local YMCA, but find that it is difficult to include the one time initiation fee and/or monthly initiation fee required for membership, consider applying for financial assistance. The assistance is available on a need basis to individuals, family, and kids., You can pick up a physical copy of the application from the YMCA center or download and fill out an electronic application as a PDF file. Access the YMCA website you need by going through the main site at www.ymca.net/join.Click the clickable link that routes you to finding your local YMCA. On the next page, enter your city, state, or zip code information.
From that list, pick the YMCA that is closest to you. On most sites, regardless of the city, the financial assistance application will be underneath the membership/join header.
 Underneath your current status, check off whether or not you are a returning YMCA financial assistance recipient looking to renew or if you are requesting financial assistance.


If it’s your first time requesting financial assistance, specify what you’re requesting financial assistance for. The membership or program will be adult membership, early childhood, family membership, after school, youth membership, or day camp.
Include the cost of the membership or program as well, so that the Annual Campaign will know how much assistance you will need.
Be as descriptive as possible when you communicate why you have needs for financial assistance. Mention the other forms of financial assistance you receive (SSI, food stamps, or Medicaid).
Attach a copy of your most recent IRS 1040 federal tax return form as evidence to further support your need.

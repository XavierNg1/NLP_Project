 The Basic is tuned to G, D, G. The Grand to D, A, D. Now, don't worry if you don't know how to read music. The best way is to buy a cheap electric tuner. The tuner will hear what key a single string is tuned to, and will have a read-out of where you are on the scale. It's just a matter of plucking the top string, and loosening or tightening the string to get the right key. In the case of the Basic strumstick, that would be G. Now, pluck the middle string, and tune it to the key of D, and so on to the bottom string, to the key of G again. There is a way to tune your Strumstick manually; which I will provide a link too at the end of this article.;
, Take a guitar pick, and just strum down all three strings. Wow! Sounds good. Just keep strumming down on the strings for awhile, and just get a feel for it.
 Take your time, and really feel how you become more loose and comfortable with each stroke.
 Now you're strumming. Don't worry about your other hand yet. Just strum.
 Place your index or middle finger, whichever one is the most comfortable for you, on the bottom string. This will also be the thinnest string. Press your finger in between two frets, and now strum. Make sure you're only pressing on the bottom string. Listen to how different it sounds, than when you were strumming without holding down the string.
 It sounds different again. Hey! You're starting to play notes. Keep strumming and move your finger to other frets, and listen to how it all sounds good. There are no wrong notes!

, Just keep playing until you're comfortable with strumming. If you become frustrated, just go back to practicing strumming without using your other hand.
 The sheet music for the Strumstick has this in mind. It will have a number that corresponds with what fret your finger should be on. I will provide a link too some songs. You can also purchase music books for the Mountain Dulcimer, as long as the songs are in the same key.

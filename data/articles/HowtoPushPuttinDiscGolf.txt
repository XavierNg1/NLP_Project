 Take note of whether you are inside the "putting circle" or not. The putting circle is within 10 meters of the basket.
 The wind will affect your disc while it is in the air. In general, the following are true: A tailwind will push your putt down.
A headwind will will make your putt rise.
A crosswind will push the disc in the direction of the wind.
 If you have multiple putters, you should take the previous two steps into account when choosing which one to throw. For the majority of your putts, you should use a stiff putter that you are comfortable throwing.,,, You will be pushing the disc with your palm when you throw, so you just want to make sure the back of your grip is firm.,, Your dominant foot is the foot on the same side as the arm you throw with. Your feet should be about shoulder length apart.,, Your back foot should be on similar angle to your front foot.,, This is where you will be releasing the disc. The orientation of the disc as it leaves your hand will determine how it will fly. For a push putt, you want to release the disc slightly nose up, to make sure you get the disc to the basket. Your wrist should be slightly bent to be in line with your feet.,, All of your weight should be on your back leg while your front leg is straight with the knee locked and your toe off the ground., As your arm raises, your back leg should lift off the ground., The momentum needed to get the disc to the basket is going to be created from timing the movements correctly. You want to aggregate the energy from you lower and upper body into the exact moment you release the disc. You will get a minimal amount of energy from your wrist as it moves back to a straight position on release., Quickly collect your disc from the basket so the next person can throw., Don't dwell on it, but make a point of it, so you can throw better on the next try., It may feel like an unnatural technique, but the push putt style will enable you to be a consistent putter.

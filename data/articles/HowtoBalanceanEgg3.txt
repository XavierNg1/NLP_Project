 You can do it about March 20, on the spring equinox, or about September 23, on the autumn equinox. Some people believe that the gravitational pull of the Sun that occurs on the equinoxes can help keep an egg standing on its end. Not surprisingly, those people are wrong. You can balance an egg equally well on any day of the year. However, this makes for a good yarn and a chance to explain scientific methodology over superstition.
 If it doesn't balance, then you can try another method.

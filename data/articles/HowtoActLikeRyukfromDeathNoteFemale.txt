 This is a simple black notebook with "Death Note" written on the front and, usually, a list of rules and instructions inside. In the manga series, the Death Note is a way to kill people. Make your own Death Note notebook, or buy one on Amazon or eBay.;
, It doesn't have to be expensive or fancy, just try to keep the majority of your jewelry, silver chains, bangles, studs, tapers, facial piercings, and rings. Wear a lot but don't overdo it, which means just make the accessories stand out without having a heavy weight of them on your costume. For more references, see a photo of Ryuk and try as much to mirror him.
 The minimum amount of make up you should wear is black eyeliner, gray/blue/white eye shadow, black mascara, and a red/wine lipstick.
 Ryuk is clearly obsessed with apples - he carries them everywhere, and they can even be used as a bargaining tool to make him do something. You don't need to eat apples all the time, but at least carry one around with you, for they are basically one of Ryuk's trademarks.
 Black shirts, black skinny jeans/skirts and the like are recommended for extra effects and mood.
 Just like the actual Ryuk following Light/Kira.
 it's not in Ryuk's character.
 Think about imitating Ryuk when he floats around Light. Keep a hunched back, limp arms, and a big, creepy smile on your face.
 Do this in a discreet manner when something amuses you.
 No matter what the people or critics say, this is your costume, your character, your mood and just basically "you". Add your own touch to this. Be unique!

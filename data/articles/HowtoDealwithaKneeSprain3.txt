 The major symptoms of a knee sprain are as follows:


A popping sound or feeling at the time of injury can sometimes be heard if a ligament is completely torn.
Swelling of your knee. Ligaments are rich in blood supply. When they are injured, they tend to bleed inside the knee resulting in knee swelling. The degree of swelling will depend on the extent of injury to the ligament. Minor injuries will cause minimal swelling while a completely torn ligament can result in significant blood loss and knee swelling.
Pain in your knee. Again, the degree of pain may depend on the severity of the knee injury.
Tenderness around your knee on touching. This may be mild tenderness over the actual ligament in minor sprains, or more generalized and severe tenderness if a ligament is torn.
Restricted knee movements. In complete ligament tears, movement can be severely reduced, whereas in minor sprains, you may have a relatively good amount of knee movement.
Limping. Ligaments are vital for knee stability during movements. When ligaments are injured, you may limp when try to walk or run.
Bruising around your knee can sometimes appear, although not always. It may take some time for bruising to develop. Bruising is caused by the rupture of small blood vessels just beneath the skin.
 Two imaging studies are important for knee sprains: Xray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).X rays: X-rays are done to see whether knee bones are injured or not. A simple knee sprain will not have any bone fracture but with more a severe injury to knee, bones can be fractured too.
MRI: An MRI uses magnetic waves to visualize soft tissues of the body. An MRI of the knee will give valuable information about any tear or rupture of ligaments, whether partial or complete.

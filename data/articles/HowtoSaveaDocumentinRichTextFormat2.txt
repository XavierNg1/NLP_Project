 This will open it on the corresponding word processor program on your computer, such as MS Word (Microsoft), Apple Pages (Mac), or OpenOffice (freeware).
 Once the document is open, click on the “File” button on the top-left section of the menu bar (for Word and OpenOffice) or application menu (for Apple Pages), and select “Save As” from the drop-down menu.
 On the Save As window, type in the new name you want for the document, or you can also just leave it unchanged.


Using the same file name will not overwrite the existing document since these are two different file types. The exception will be is if you opened an RTF file to begin with, in which case you really need to use a different file name.
 Do this by clicking on the File Type drop-down menu. Scroll down the list, and select “Rich Text Format (RTF).” Click on the “Save” button, and the document will be saved in Rich Text Format.

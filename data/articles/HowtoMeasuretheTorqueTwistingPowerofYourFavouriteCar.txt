 There are three main variables of the torque in any engine, which are: the force at specific RPMs, distance, and the constant of the torque. The force is the horsepower of your engine that you can find on the specific revolutions of the engine, or generally the term full motor torque is used to find the force at full RPMs of the engine that usually you can find on the engine specification’s table.


However, it can be found by using the horsepower-to-torque conversion tables. The distance is the length of the stroke; it means the longer the stroke, the more torque generation.






Diesel engines produce more torque than patrol units because the diesel engines use longer stroke bases to compress the air into the cylinder. Usually, the unit for the torque is used as pound-feet or lb/ft.;
, There is no secret in calculating the torque of the engine, but it is just a multiplication of force-to-distance from the center of the crankshaft.  


For instance, if you have lug nuts and you have a wrench with a foot long handle, and you apply 100 pounds of force on it, then you are simply generating the 100 lb/ft of torque.
However, if you have a two foot long wrench handle and you are applying the same force than you are producing the 200 lb/ft of torque with the same force. It was the variable of distance that caused the change in torque at the same power.
As we doubled the distance, the torque was automatically doubled. However, to calculate the full power torque of the engine, you can use the following mathematical formula;Torque = {Force X 5252} / engine RPMsOr T = {HP X 5252} / RPM Where; T = torque in lb/ft and the HP is the horsepower of the engine.






However, the 5252 is the constant and the RPM are the engine revolutions per minutes. For example, if your car is producing the 86 HP at the full motor RPMs of 5500, then you can easily calculate the torque for your car at the 5500 RPMs by applying the formula; it would be 82 lb/ft of torque.

 Cheesecake is cooked in a springform pan set in a bath of water, which prevents the cheese filling from getting dry and cracked. To keep the water from getting into the pan, wrap a few layers of aluminum foil around the bottom and sides the pan. Crimp it around the rim of the pan, making sure it is securely fastened.Be sure not to tear any holes in the foil so that water won't leak in and get the crust wet.



 


If you'd prefer not to bake the cheesecake in a water bath, you can skip this step; however, the cheesecake will probably have a crack or two.





;
, Place the graham cracker crumbs, butter and sugar in a blender or food processor and pulse until they are thoroughly combined.
 Place the crust mixture in the pan and use the back of a spoon or your fingers to flatten it evenly across the bottom of the pan. It should rise up the sides of the pan about 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm).
 Place the crust in an oven preheated to 350 degrees. Bake it for about 10 minutes, until it becomes fragrant and turns slightly darker.
 The filling should bake at a slightly lower temperature; reduce it to 325 degrees while you prepare the remaining ingredients.

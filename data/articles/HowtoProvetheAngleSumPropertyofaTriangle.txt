 Construct this line parallel to the bottom of the triangle., Remember, all of the angles that comprise a straight line must be equal to 180°. Because angle PAB, angle BAC, and angle CAQ combine together to make line PQ, their angles must sum to 180°. Call this Equation 1., Because you constructed line PQ parallel to side BC of the triangle, the alternate interior angles (PAB and ABC) made by the transversal line (line AB) are congruent. Similarly, the alternate interior angles (CAQ and ACB) made by the transversal line AC are also congruent.Equation 2: angle PAB = angle ABC
Equation 3: angle CAQ = angle ACB
It is a geometric theorem that alternate interior angles of parallel lines are congruent., Knowing that the alternate interior angles are equal lets you substitute the angles of the triangle for the angles of the line.Thus we get, Angle ABC + angle BAC + angle ACB = 180°.
In other words, in the triangle ABC, angle B + angle A + angle C = 180°. Thus, the sum of all the angles of a triangle is 180°.
 The angle sum property of a triangle states that the angles of a triangle always add up to 180°.Every triangle has three angles and whether it is an acute, obtuse, or right triangle, the angles sum to 180°.


For example, in triangle ABC, angle A + angle B + angle C = 180°.
This theorem is useful for finding the measure of an unknown angle when you know the other two.
 To really grasp this concept, it can be helpful to study some examples. Look at a right triangle, where one of the angles is 90° and the other angles each measure 45°. Summing 90° + 45° + 45° = 180°. Study other triangles of various shapes and sizes and sum their angles. You will see that they always add up to 180°.For the right triangle example: angle A = 90°, angle B = 45°, and angle C = 45°. The theorem states that angle A + angle B + angle C = 180°. Adding the angles gives you 90° + 45° + 45° = 180°. Therefore, left hand side (L.H.S.) equals right hand side (R.H.S.).
 Using simple algebra, you can use the angle sum theorem to solve for an unknown angle if you know the other two angles of the triangle. Rearrange the basic equation to solve for the unknown angle.


For example, in triangle ABC, angle A = 67° and angle B = 43°, but angle C is unknown.
angle A + angle B + angle C = 180°
67° + 43° + angle C = 180°
angle C = 180° - 67° - 43°
angle C = 70°

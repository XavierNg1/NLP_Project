 This wonder-drink has become popular in recent years for its bevy of health benefits, including its high level of antioxidants.
 Just avoid excessive use of sugars, creams, and flavors when possible, which can significantly detract from coffee’s nutritional benefits.
 Avoid fruit juices that have added sugar or are described as “juice cocktail,” however. Alternately, try making your own fruit smoothie with berries and some fruit juice or yogurt in the morning, which provides a filling, liquid, antioxidant-packed solution for breakfast on-the-go.

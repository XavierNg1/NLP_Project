 If you fail to do that, you might get "whipsawed." This is a situation when a security's price heads in one direction, but then is followed quickly by a movement in the opposite direction. You might end up selling at a loss, only to watch helplessly as a stock bounces back without you., This means the price at the end of a trading day is higher than its opening price on the next trading day. The overnight price drop could fall past your trigger point, and the subsequent sale could result in a loss for you (or at least less of a gain than you'd expected). Be careful with stop orders for stocks that gap often, such as small-cap or low-volume stocks. Familiarize yourself with a stock's daily chart to see if it has a tendency to gap., If you choose a particular stop known as a day order, it will expire at the end of the trading day if it is not price-triggered before then. You would be required to renew such an order on a daily basis if you so desire.

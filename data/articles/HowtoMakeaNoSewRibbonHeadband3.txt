Repeat this step for the other end of the ribbon., Draw a squiggle of hot glue onto the headband, then quickly press the ribbon down into it. Leave about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of ribbon hanging over the end of the ribbon., Work 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) at a time, or the hot glue will set too fast. Keep the ribbon straight and taut as you glue it down., Some headbands are wide at the center and narrow at the ends. If you have a headband like this, you'll need to fold the overhanging side edges under the headband, and hot glue them in place.Don't worry about the 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) bits of ribbon hanging over the ends just yet.
 Cover one end of your headband with hot glue. Quickly fold the excess ribbon over the edge, and press it into the glue. Repeat this step for the other end of the headband.

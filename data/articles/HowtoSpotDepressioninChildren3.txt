 Don’t try to diagnose your child with depression yourself. Even if they’re showing some of the symptoms of depression, they may not actually be depressed. If you’re still worried, stay calm and contact your child’s pediatrician for an evaluation.If your child has been experiencing symptoms for less than two weeks, they may just be having normal mood swings. As long as your child doesn’t seem to be in crisis, wait and see if the symptoms last past the two-week mark.
 Talk to other family members, your child’s teachers, and any other adults who interact with your child often. Ask them whether they’ve noticed your child behaving differently or having mood problems., Take your child to their pediatrician for a checkup. Tell the doctor about the symptoms you’ve noticed, and ask them to rule out any physical causes. If your child is physically healthy, the doctor will probably refer you to a pediatric mental health specialist for an evaluation., Discuss your child’s treatment options with their doctor, psychologist, or psychiatrist. If they recommend talk therapy, make your child an appointment with a therapist and stay up-to-date on their progress. If your child needs medicine, make sure they take it as directed.Talk therapy is most often recommended to treat depression in kids and teens. Medication is usually prescribed only in severe cases.
Help your child find a therapist they’re comfortable with. You may have to try more than one before you find someone who is a good fit.
 Help your child stay healthy by giving them nutritious foods and encouraging them to exercise. Boost their spirits by doing fun things together, and make sure they have time to see their friends and work on their hobbies.For instance, you could watch movies with your child or spend an afternoon hiking at your favorite park.

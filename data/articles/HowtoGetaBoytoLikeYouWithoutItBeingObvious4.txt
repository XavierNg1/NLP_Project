 Now and then you should let him know you think he is cool. Keep it light. Just say something positive to him about him. Who doesn’t like that? If he made a good play in a sport, let him know.Ask for his help with something. This will make him feel good and it will make him realize that you think highly of him. This is a good way to approach a boy who doesn't know you very well or even realize you have a crush on him.
Never forget that boys are pretty insecure. They aren’t sure whether you like them, either. They don’t know what to do. So a compliment here or there can give him the clue to make a move without feeling like you’re chasing him too much.
Ask him questions, so you don’t seem like you are talking about yourself all of the time.You want to seem like you are interested in who he is and what he likes.
 People are drawn to people who smile. It makes them feel good, and shows you’re confident. No slouching or looking away when you run into him!


If you smile, you are going to look prettier much faster than if you cake on makeup. People are drawn to people who seem happy because they want to be happy too.
Have a gentle, caring nature. Boys like that. Don’t just text him a boring “hey or ‘sup.”

, This might work in the short run, but it will backfire big-time in the long run, and it’s kind of mean. You might end up chasing him away.


Be modest and selfless. Show caring about others. Don’t be a mean girl - even about people not in his presence.
Avoid bringing drama or negativity into his life all the time. Boys can’t stand this. This also means you shouldn’t gossip or be mean about other people, including other girls, in his presence.
Don't act too jealous of him, too. It shows a lack of confidence. And understand that he needs time to hang out with the boys.

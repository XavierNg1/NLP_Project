The clothes should be immersed in a solution of alum in water at a ratio of 1:10 (1 part alum to 10 parts water). The alum causes a chemical reaction to occur on the clothing, resulting in a deposit of alum on the fibers of the clothing (coating the individual fibers within the yarn), and waterproofing it., To do this, simply wet the clothes. If you notice the appearance of beads of water on the clothing, this means that clothes do not absorb water and are waterproof.If there are any dark stains on the clothing, the fabric has absorbed the water and the clothes are not waterproof. If this occurs, repeat your chosen waterproofing method or try a different method.

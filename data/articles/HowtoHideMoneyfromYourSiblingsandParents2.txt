 These places include bills behind electrical outlets or in light fixtures. You do not want to accidentally cause a fire!

, Some places, like air vents, may seem like really good places to hide your money. However, it will not do you any good if you can’t retrieve it!


You can avoid losing your money forever if you try out your hiding place first. For example, try putting your hand in the space you’re trying to use before you put anything valuable in there.
 Some places may not seem obvious but are. Avoid such places like:Under your mattress
In a nightstand/table/desk
In a purse/backpack/wallet (even if that is hidden somewhere!)
In jacket or coat pockets

, Some places might be too good for hiding things. Always remember where you hid your cash and valuables.
 Hiding your money somewhere where it can get wet (and then moldy) is a bad idea! Some places that can get damp include:


Outside (unless properly protected with something like plastic)
Near water sources (toilets, sinks)
Basements

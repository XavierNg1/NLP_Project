 At first, just take it out with your hands and have fun kneading it, hitting it, rolling it up into a little ball, letting it drip from your hands into the bowl, and molding it into a variety of shapes. You can also--









Mix and match with other colors to make designs.
Strain and drop the oobleck through strainers, strawberry crates, and etc to watch how it flows differently than water.
 Once you're more comfortable with the substance, you should see what happens when you squeeze the goo hard, or when you let it sit for a minute before picking it up again. Here are some other Oobleck experiments to try:









Make a ball out of the Oobleck by rolling it around quickly in your palms. Then, stop applying pressure to the mixture and it will flow out of your hands.
Fill a pie plate with a thick layer of Oobleck and slap the surface with your open hand. You'll be surprised by how all of the liquid stays on the plate because of the force you applied.
Supersize the pie plate experiment by filling a large bucket or plastic bin with Oobleck and jumping up and down in it.
Take the Oobleck in the freezer, and try it. Try it in the heat too. Is there a difference?

, You can use warm water to clean the Oobleck off your hands, clothes, and even off of your counter. You can rinse a bit of it out of your bowl, but make sure not to let too much of it get down the sink.


If you let it dry out, it turns into a powder that is easily swept, vacuumed, or wiped up.
 Place the Oobleck into an airtight container or a zip-seal bag. Take it out again later and have fun playing with it. If you're done with the Oobleck for good, do not throw it down the sink, or it may clog your drain. Throw it in the trash instead.


You'll likely need to re-add water to your oobleck to play with it a second time.

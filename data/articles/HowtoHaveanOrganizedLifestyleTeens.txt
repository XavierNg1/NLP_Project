 The goals can be something like Stop talking in class, Exercise more, or to improve grades by report card time. These goals can be on different topics of life from health to behavior to school.;
, This may include your bedroom, locker, desk,bookbag, etc. Make sure they're cleaned out before you think about starting to get organized. This will help you feel like one part of organizing your life is accomplished.
 If you already have one, awesome. Write down your daily events. Let's say you're going to a friend's house at 3:30 on Tuesday. Write it down. It keeps things more organized when it comes to homework. If you're at your friend's house until 7:00, that gives you until 10:00 to finish that page of homework. It will keep you from forgetting your projects, too!

, Don't wait until "later" to do it, or that rainfall will turn into a hurricane. It's way easier to just keep it neat as you go throughout your day!

, For example: 6:00 - Wake up; 6:05 - Get dressed; 6:10 - Eat breakfast. Make sure you stick to the schedule, don't skip some things or don't press the snooze button, as that will ruin your schedule. However, keep things flexible, or it will be too confining. The best way to do this is to create a schedule on a white board so you can change it every day and not waste paper.
 Have you changed your behavior the way you wanted to? Or have you raised your grade in science class?

, If Track is canceled, write it down. It lets you recall things easier.
 Does it seem more organized? Have you done everything you have needed to do? If so, congratulations!

 Talking to a nurse or other medical professional can help tailor your recovery plan to you. A medical professional can also recommend a particular medicine or even call in a prescription to a pharmacy for you.
 Do not hesitate to go if your symptoms include a high fever (over 101°F or 38.3°C), chills that make you shake, an inability to keep down food or drinks, and bloody phlegm or mucus. Any of these elements will require more help than you can give yourself at home. , If she gives you a prescription, fill it and take it as long the doctor recommends. If she wants a follow-up visit, schedule it. Even if you think you are feeling a lot better and don’t need that medication or other visit, trust that your medical professional is recommending it for a reason. Don’t hijack your recovery.

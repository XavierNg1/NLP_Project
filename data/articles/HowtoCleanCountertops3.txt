 In general, stain removers should not be used too often. Even mild stain removers can wear down a counter's surface. If you notice a spill, wipe it up with paper towel promptly. If there is any remaining mess, wipe the area down with water or a cleaner that works for your countertop. Avoid letting stains become set into the counter., A mixture of water and white vinegar can be spritzed on stains for limestone, slate, and soapstone. This should remove set in stains. You can also add enough water to baking soda to form a paste. Rub the paste into the stain until it lifts and then rinse the paste off with water., Bleach diluted with water can be worked into stains on a tile counter top using a toothbrush. Make sure to dilute the bleach to safe levels. The instructions on a container of bleach should tell you the ratios to use to dilute your bleach.If there is mildew in the cracks of tiles, however, opt for a mildew cleaner. You can buy this at most grocery or department stores.
 Silestone is particularly susceptible to damage. Store bought cleaners often wear down silestone, as will some cleaners made from household products. As specific types of silestone differ, check the manufacturer's label to see what is safe to use on your specific brand of silestone.

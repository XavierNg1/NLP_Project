 Using your mouse, select "Window" and choose "Pages." The palette should open. The Pages palette shows you how many pages and spreads you are working with, and indicates which master pages you're using.


View the Pages palette on your screen. The Pages palette may already be open, but not visible because other palette windows are open. Click on the Pages palette tab to view it.
Expand the window. Click the mouse on the arrows icon positioned in the upper right area of the palettes. The arrows are small and point to the right. When you click on the arrows, the window automatically sweeps open to display options.;
, Using the Pages palette, add pages to your InDesign document.


Drag a page into the document area. Position your mouse over the document page. Left click your mouse and hold it as you drag the page icon.
Add the page. Let go of the mouse button when the page is in the document area. With this method, you can add one page, multiple pages or page spreads, which are 2 adjacent, facing pages.
 If you want to add several pages all at once, InDesign provides a method for doing this.


Open the Pages palette open and left click on the submenu.
Hold the mouse button to view the drop-down menu. The submenu can be accessed at the icon in the upper right corner of the palette. The icon looks like tiny lines of text or a mini document.
Select "Insert Pages." Fill in the number of pages to add. Select whether the inserted pages should precede or follow other pages, appear as the first page of the document or appear as the last page of the document. If you want the added pages to appear before or after a page, input the page number they should precede or follow. Click "OK."

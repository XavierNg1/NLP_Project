 When a dragon fruit is not ripe it will be green in color. As the fruit matures and ripens, the outer skin color changes to red or yellow, depending on the variety.When ripe the outer skin should be bright and even-colored. If the fruit has a lot of dark blotches on the skin, similar to bruises on an apple, then it may be overripe. A few spots, however, are normal.;
, Dragon fruit wings are the leafy part that extend off of the fruit. When they start to dry out, turn brown, and wither, the dragon fruit is ripe and ready to be eaten. Conversely, if the wings are still colorful (ie red or yellow), that means the fruit is underripe and still needs more time to ripen.Once the dragon fruit has reached the stage of ripeness where the wings start to wither, the fruit should come off the vine fairly easily with a light twist. If the fruit falls off the vine on its own, it is overripe.
 The inside of a dragon fruit is usually white, deep pink, or purple, depending on the variety, and contains tiny black seeds. The black seeds are edible and are similar in appearance to those found in a kiwi. When ripe the inside of a dragon fruit should appear juicy yet firm in texture: like a cross between a melon and a pear.When a dragon fruit is overripe the inner flesh will turn brown in color, similar to the bruised flesh of a banana. You should not eat fruit that is brown or dried out.

 Whenever you go on a long journey or to unfamiliar places, one of the most important things to have when you're traveling is a map. It tells you your destination, the dangers, and other necessary information to make sure you don't get lost or end up in a road that has no gas/petrol station. The same logic applies to social media. It is important that your social media initiative has a good set of metrics or measurements that will tell how you are doing at any one time. Nathan Gilliatt of Social Target LLC categorizes measurements into 4 distinct types:PR/media measurement - Viewing social media as media for their ability to reach an audience.
Word of mouth measurement - Viewing social media as online interactions among people.
Web analytics - Interested in people's usage patterns, as both audience and customers.
Opinion research - Mining online opinions as the world's largest focus group.
 All these are important to consider but even more important is to be able to translate the measurement information above into what we call "Social Media Equity" -- a set of fundamentals that are important for companies to make decisions about their social media investments.


Strength of relationship (size, quality, relevance of type of activities etc)
Degree of familiarity (with your business, brands etc, not just awareness)
Degree of efficiency (where and how efficient are your viral logistics)
Value creation (are there any?)

, When you have loyalty without social media equity nailed down, it is hard to say whether your investment in social media has actually worked. This is because having 100,000 readers in your blog only says that you have 100,000 eyeballs of awareness but is this sufficient as a measure for performance?

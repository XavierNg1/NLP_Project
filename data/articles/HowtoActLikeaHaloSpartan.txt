 Always stand up straight, and look presentable as often as you can.;
, The SPARTANS aren't ones for small-talk.
 Speak only when spoken to, and give direct answers.
 Put others' needs above your own, and don't be an attention-seeker.
 Perform work diligently and effectively without complaining.
 Remain observant of everything going on around you. Calculate risks, and strategize before making a move.
 Accept criticism, but don't take bait from those seeking a reaction.
 You don't have to save the planet from aliens to be a hero. In fact, picking up someone's dropped books, or helping an old woman cross the street is a perfect start.

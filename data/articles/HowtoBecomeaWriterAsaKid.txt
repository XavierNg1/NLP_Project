 Get a writing journal to jot down ideas. The ideas can be anything from a good comeback you heard in the hallway at school to an almost-accident what-if question. For example, what would have happened if your math teacher really had fallen? Ask the question and just let your mind run wild!;
, If you are one of the few people in the world that actually enjoy a school research report, you will most likely want to write non-fiction books. If you love Dear John, The Notebook, or Twilight, the non-fiction genre is probably not going to be a good fit. There's an old saying, "Write what you know." Throw that old idea out the metaphorical window. If that were true, you wouldn't have the entire sci-fi genre!

, You're life may not be a dull as you think. Once you open your eyes, the world is your imagination. Think about the question "What if this happened?" or use your dreams! Some dreams just have to be told!


People may not care or want to know how messed up your mind is. But if you "lose" your notebook, people won't be able to help themselves and will snoop.



Move on to publishing a book or short story.
Be warned, magazines and agents are very picky. If you don't follow their very precise instructions, that can get you canned before they even read the story! Follow their advice to a tee, even if they want a special font for it to be printed in.
 Most major publishing labels only take books they know that they can make a New York Times best-seller. Try not to be offended if they reject you. Try a smaller company and when you finally get noticed, then go to a major company. Even if you really want to, do not cuss the poor person out!

, If you are worried about people judging you because of your youth, come up with a pseudonym. Be very thorough. Come up with a birthdate, eye color, name, and anything you think of.

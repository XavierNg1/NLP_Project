 It can be created with medium-length or long hair. The braid wraps along the head almost like a headband and continues along the back of the head. This is a more difficult braid hairstyle and may require some assistance.



Part your hair along the side, where you want the headband braid to begin.






Start the braid about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6Â cm) back from your hairline along your part.






Separate the hair into 3 sections and create a traditional braid, staying close to the scalp as you braid.






Continue the braid to about your ear.



Begin a French braid from the headband braid along 1 side of your head, wrapping the braid along the back of your head. You essentially will be braiding the headband braid into the French braid.






Separate 3 sections of hair like a traditional braid, but leave 2 extra sections of hair on each side of the braid. Use the remaining hair from the headband braid as 1 of the 3 starting French braid sections.






Begin braiding the 3 sections, keeping the braid close to the scalp and wrapping it around the back of the head. After a few knots, add in a few pieces from 1 of the extra sections to the braid.






Continue braiding 1 knot, and then add a few pieces from the other extra section.






Continue braiding and incorporating the extra sections of hair into the braid until you reach the end of your hair. Secure the braid with a rubber band or hair elastic.






Secure the French braid along the back of the head with bobby pins.



Create a traditional braid along the other side of your head with the remaining loose hair or repeat the French braid on the other side.






Secure the braid with a rubber band or hair elastic.

 Like many pests, wasps are attracted to food—especially foods that are high in sugar and meat products. This includes pet food. Make sure that your trash cans are sealed tight, bird feeders are far from the house, and food isn’t left out., Check your house for unsealed vents, torn screens, cracks around windows and door frames, or open dampers. Seal off these problem areas and the wasps no longer have entry ways into your home.
 Swatting wasps is actually counterproductive. When a wasp is squashed, a pheromone is released which attracts nearby wasps. Rather, walk away from any hovering wasps.

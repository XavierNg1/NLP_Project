 If you can't get any graham crackers, you can use another type of honey-cinnamon flavored crackers instead.
 You can use any type of chocolate spread, such as Nutella. You can also use chocolate fudge sauce instead. If you are using chocolate fudge sauce, make sure that it is cold and thick, like butter; don't heat and melt it beforehand.
 If you can't find any marshmallow spread, you can use one marshmallow, or four mini marshmallows.
 Place the chocolate and marshmallow sides together, and make sure that the corners match up. To prevent the graham cracker from getting soggy, put a paper towel underneath it.
 If you are making more than one s'more at a time, you may need to increase the cooking time to 20 to 30 seconds., Press down hard enough so that the s'more sticks together, but not so hard that the marshmallow oozes out everywhere, or that the cracker breaks.
 Because you did not heat the chocolate, you won't have to wait that long. A few seconds to a minute will be enough. S'more are delicious, but not when they burn your mouth!

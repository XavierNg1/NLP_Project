Buy a teen magazine like Tiger Beat, J-14, (etc) and look on the back, then through the whole magazine. If you're lucky, you might just find an e-mail address just for fans, or maybe the pop star's real e-mail!
Look on the internet. A lot of people or maybe just one person may have found the pop star's e-mail. Maybe you can find a fan-site that might have the e-mail listed somewhere.
Go to the Disney website. (www.disney.com) You might find what you're looking for if you look hard enough.;
, Make sure you include your name so the pop star will know who you are. Maybe he/she will write back! Even if he/she doesn't, you'll know that you sent the e-mail to tell the pop star you appreciate them and are a fan. Did you ever thing that maybe the pop star you e-mailed is busy? If so, don't worry. He/she probably read your e-mail, but didn't have a lot of time to write back.

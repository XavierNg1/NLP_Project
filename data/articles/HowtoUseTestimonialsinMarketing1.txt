 Any time someone buys a product or uses your services, ask them to take a survey that tells you whether they were pleased.


Get permission to use comments and names. Testimonials are always stronger if an actual name is associated with a comment.;
, The evaluation can be similar to the survey you give customers, and remember to ask permission to use names and comments publicly.
 These are repeat customers who you know appreciate your work.


Suggest a letter, an email or just a few comments describing your product or service and why they like it. Make sure they know you will be using the testimonial for marketing, and only ask customers you know are happy with what they get from you.
 When you or your business gets a compliment, ask the person raving about you to put it in writing.
 Photos that accompany testimonials will help the words feel more alive, since readers will see the person who wrote or said them.
 YouTube videos and content that can be viewed and shared instantly are popular.


Use your smart phone or a small flip camera to record people giving testimonials about your product or service. Amateur videos come across as more real than highly polished, professional videos.

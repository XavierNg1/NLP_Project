 Set the paint can on top of the fabric, near the bottom edge. Trace around the paint can with the fabric marker.


Cut 2 pieces of fabric around the traced line. This will give you 2 circles for the ends of the decorative pillow.

, It should be .5 inches (1.27 cm) away from the edge. This is the seam that will connect the tube to the ends.



Clip up to the stitched line, but not through it. The clipped edges will make it easier for you to sew the pillow together in the end.
 You can do this by multiplying the diameter of the circle by 3.14 for the circumference. You need this measurement to find out how much fabric to cut for the middle of the bolster pillow.


For example, if the diameter of the circles is 5 inches (12.7 cm), the circumference is 15.7 inches (39.9 cm), or 5 x 3.14.

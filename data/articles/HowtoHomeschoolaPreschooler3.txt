 Speech and language skills are important for your child’s development. You can start developing these skills by teaching your child the basic ABC’s. Your child should be able to recognize letters (upper and lower case), their sounds, and be able to identify them. You can start by pasting images of the letters to a big poster board. You can also paste images of things that start with the letter. For example, for the letter C you can paste an image of a cat next to the letter. You can even add a physical component by asking your child to meow like a cat., By naming animals and parts of the body, you can develop your child's language skills, as well as their science skills. Associate each part of the body or an animal with a specific letter. For example, "L" is for "Leg," and have them point to their leg. Do this for all major body parts, like their nose, mouth, hands, and feet.
 You can do this by creating a board, like the one for the ABC’s. Next to each number, you can use physical objects to represent their amounts. For example, you can glue 3 pennies next to the number three, or glue 4 macaroni noodles next to the number 4.Also teach your child how to recognize different amounts, like, for example, that 4 is more than 3. Do this by counting each amount and explaining to them which is more and which is less. For example, count each penny one by one, then count each macaroni one by one. Direct their attention to the fact that because there is one more macaroni, 4 is bigger than 3.

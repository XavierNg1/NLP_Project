 In areas where you remove hair, regularly use skin cream. The more healthy and moisturized your skin is, the less prone it will be to bumps when you do pluck hairs. Do not moisturize only before and after hair removal. Do it daily to keep your skin strong.Opt for a mild daily moisturizer. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive options.
Hydrocortisone cream works well if you do have bumps you need to treat. It prevents swelling and inflammation, both of which can lead to red dots.
 Exfoliation gets rid of dead skin cells, leaving skin fresh and soft. Exfoliating a few times a week, focusing in particular on areas where you pluck hair, can help prevent red bumps.You can exfoliate using exfoliating gloves, which you can buy online or at a beauty supplies store. These are gloves with textured fabric that you rub on your skin while showering to remove dead skin cells.You can also opt to scrub exfoliating soaps and creams, which are more grainy than regular products, into your skin to exfoliate. Most department stores and drug stores sell exfoliating creams.
Remember, you should always moisturize after exfoliating.
 You should also be strict about moisturizing after plucking in addition to doing so regularly. This is especially important if you do things like wax and shave before plucking your hair, as your skin will be very sensitive and more prone to damage. Moisturizing can help minimize irritation.You can apply your regular moisturizer after plucking. However, there are many moisturizers specifically designed to be used after shaving. Stop by a local drugstore or salon and pick up a cream designed for use after shaving if you're very prone to red hairs.

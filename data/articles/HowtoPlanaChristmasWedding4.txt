 Not everyone celebrates Christmas. If you have guests who participate in other religious holidays around the Christmas season, be aware of this. You do not want to plan your ceremony on an important day of Hanukkah, for example.Read up on all holidays that take place around Christmas. Avoid picking a date that interferes with other holidays, especially if you know for a fact you have guests attending that celebrate holidays like Hanukkah or Ramadan.
 The weather can be unpredictable during December. Even if you live in a warm region, if you have guests flying in from Ohio, there may be flight or driving delays. When booking hotels, do so in a way that allows a little wiggle room. Make sure guests can arrive a few days prior to the wedding rather than the day before. This way, if there's a delay due to weather, guests will not be at as high of risk of missing your ceremony., When assembling gift packages, use your Christmas theme to your advantage. Give your guests Christmas related items.Give your guests Christmas-related snacks. Pack gift bags with things like hot cocoa and Christmas cookies.
Ornaments can be a nice touch. Try giving members of the wedding party ornaments with their names on them as a gift.
 Review average prices of hotels and plane tickets when picking your travel date. You do not want to force guests to spend extra money attending your wedding by planning your festivities on peak travel days. Try to find a date where cost of travel is reasonable as to not put your guests out.

 Using clean eyelashes to start makes this method less messy.
 You can run them under warm water for a few minutes or just rub them together to heat them up.
 Take your pointer finger and push your eyelashes up against the top of your eye. Hold the position for at least thirty seconds. Repeat with your lower lashes and your other eye.
 Carefully run the wand from roots to tips. If you need to comb your lashes, do so gently so you don't lose your curl.

 Never skip meals, especially breakfast. Breakfast is the meal that starts your metabolism for the day, so the longer you delay breakfast the longer it'll take for your metabolism to start burning fat. Small/light breakfasts are a great way to start your morning because they kick your metabolism into gear without overloading on calories.
 On your next trip to the grocery store, pick things like fruits, vegetables, chicken, turkey, fish and whole wheat bread. Low-fat dairy, like yogurt and milk, is another good option as well.
 For example, grilled chicken with a side of vegetables is a lot healthier than a burger and fries.
 You should be drinking about eight glasses per day. In addition, choosing water over high calorie drinks like soda can save you several hundred calories per day. It will also help you digest your food better and keep you hydrated. The more water you drink, the less your body stores.
 When you're eating food, chew slowly and make sure all of your food is finely "mushed." Not only does this help your digestive system, but it makes you feel full. The reason for this is that if the food is un-chewed, it stays chunky through your digestion and builds up in the stomach area.
 If you actually eat slower, you feel fuller! This is because your brain takes up to 20 minutes to tell your body you ate. So if you try to eat slow, by the time you finish, the message is sent, and you're not eating unnecessary extra servings.
 If you're cooking your own food, you have total control over what you're putting into your body. You can find healthy recipes for any meal of the day on lots of different websites.

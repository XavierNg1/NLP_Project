 Miso can be used where you might use a stock, either in place of that stock or to boost the flavour of a less strong-tasting stock.;
, These salty additions to food can be easily substituted by miso without losing the salty spark.
 This is the most common usage of miso. A very simple version is:


Mix miso with water, add cut spring onions (scallions), mushrooms and tiny chunks of tofu. Sprinkle a little pepper. Drink as is or add udon noodles for a substantial soup.
 Add to marinade sauces or even use just on its own.
 Add a couple of spoonfuls to make gravy taste really good.
 A very simple and tasty dressing can be made as follows:


Mix miso with preferred oil, grated fresh ginger and finely chopped fresh garlic. Pour over salad.
 Add miso instead of milk; simply dissolve in a little hot water and mash through. Use the light miso for this purpose; it will taste delicious!

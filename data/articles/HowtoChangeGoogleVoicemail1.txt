 Visit the Google Voice website, and enter your Google email and address in the given text fields. Click the blue “Sign in” button to proceed to your Google Voice account.


Note that if you are already logged into any of the Google products, like Gmail or YouTube, Google will not ask you to log in again. This is because Google has made it possible for users to use one account across all of their products.;
, This icon is at the top right corner of the Google Voice page. Once you click the icon, a drop-down menu appears.
 This will direct you to the Settings page.
 The button is blue and found at the top middle part of the page, and will direct you to the Voicemail and Text settings page.
 A window will pop up prompting you to enter the name of the greeting.
 Do this in the text-field area of the pop-up window, and click “Continue” once you’re done. This will open a Record Greeting box.
 On the Greeting box, you will see a “Phone to Ring” option. Click the down arrow and a drop-down menu will appear. Select the forwarding phones where Google Voice will call you to record your message. The options are two: either your Google Talk or your mobile number.
 Google Voice will then call you on the forwarding phone you selected. Wait for the call. It will take a few seconds before your phone rings.
 Pick up the call and start recording the new voicemail greeting when prompted. Google Voice will then automatically save the recording once the call is terminated.


You can now close the Greeting box by clicking the X at the top right corner of the box.
 Go to Voicemail and Greeting option under the “Voicemail & Text” tab to set your voicemail as default. This is achieved by clicking the drop-down arrow next to “Record new greeting,” then clicking the name of the new recording.


Once you’re done, save the changes by clicking “Save” at the bottom.

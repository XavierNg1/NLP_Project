 Size is not crucial because there is nothing realistic about these dolls, but it should be large enough to see easily--at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) or more.
,, Position it in the middle of the top third of the bag. This will leave room for you to add a crown, a headdress, or some such ridiculous item.,, The body lines down the sides should be at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) or more apart. They can be straight or curved, but should go all the way to the bottom of the bag .,, You can also stamp images or words, and/or add stickers, beads, etc.,,, Stitch on or very close to the drawn lines. Do not stitch across the bottom. A contrasting color thread is suggested., Cut across the bottom to make it straight. If desired, decorate the back of your doll., If you do not want to melt the wax in your skillet, pour in some water then place a small aluminum foil throwaway pan in the skillet, or use a standard baking pan or casserole dish lined with aluminum foil. You can also use a double-boiler filled with the wax. If using a double-boiler, you will dip your doll in the wax using tongs. If using the skillet, make yourself a holder from aluminum foil: Tear off a length of the foil, scrunch it up and roll it until you have a sturdy stick. Bend it up about 10 inches (25.4 cm) from one end . Insert the long end into the doll. Hold the shorter end in your hand and dip the doll in the wax . Make certain that the doll is completely covered on both sides with the wax. Hold it over the wax to let any excess drip off; then stand her up to dry completely.,, Then make a bunch to use as: table favors, place cards, on sticks as a centerpiece, a grouping for a temporary "art piece" or use longer bags to make wine bottle covers.

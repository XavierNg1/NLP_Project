 - These materials include a copy of your resume, a copy of each job posting or ad to which you've applied and your research notes about the company. Since it's a phone call you can easily refer to these things without the caller being aware of what you're doing.;
, There may also be questions relating to your job stability or why you changed from job to job.
 The call will generally be made during business hours and may take you by surprise. If that happens ask the caller to hold for a moment while you move to a quiet location. Or ask if you may call the person 'right back'. It is also acceptable to let the call go to voice mail. That will give you time to prepare for the call.
 Use Mr. and Ms. Don't call the person by her fist name unless invited to do so.
 You need to know who you're dealing with. If you can't tell by the caller's title ask if she's "the hiring manager". If she isn't she'll be flattered and if she is...good! Keep in mind that the person screening you can only pass you through to the next step or screen you out. She can't hire you.
 Be pleasant and easy to talk with while remaining business like. Smile when you talk. Don't talk too fast. When you want to emphasize a point don't raise your voice stand up instead. It gives your voice more energy.
 Make note of the date and time; the name, title and phone number of the person with whom you'll be meeting; the address or location; and directions to get there (if offered).
 End on the upbeat.

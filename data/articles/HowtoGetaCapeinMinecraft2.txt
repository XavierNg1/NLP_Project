 Some of the more recent skin packs for console editions of Minecraft contain some skins with capes. For example, Skin Pack 4 contains a skin of a knight wearing a cape. Skin Pack 4 is not currently available for the PlayStation versions of Minecraft console edition.


Note that Minecraft Capes for Xbox Live avatars are separate from in-game capes. These avatar capes can only be used for decorating your Xbox Live avatar.
 Starting with MineCon 2015, the MineCon attendees cape along with several past MineCon capes were made available for free for console players while MineCon was underway. The skin pack needed to be downloaded from the console's online store during the limited window of availability. There's a good chance that the same thing will happen with MineCon 2016, though no details have been announced at the time of this writing.


The MineCon 2015 pack is no longer available. Make sure you check the store during MineCon to see if the current year's cape is available.
 Once you've purchased a skin pack, you can access it from the Change Skin menu on the pause screen. You can tab through the different packs and then scroll through each available skin. Use the right analog stick to rotate the skin to see if it has a cape.

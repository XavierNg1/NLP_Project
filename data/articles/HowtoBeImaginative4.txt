 Learn to start thinking in metaphors. Be very purposeful when you see an object or problem to transform it into something else. For example, if you need to create a name for a product, think about what that product reminds you of rather than the product itself.Practice thinking in metaphors by looking at a flower, like a daisy. Think of the cultural context of a daisy or where you have seen one before.
You may have seen little girls wearing daisies in their hair, so a daisy could represent a little girl.
You may have heard the phrase “pushing up daisies,” so a daisy could represent someone’s gravesite.
You may have heard the saying, “fresh as a daisy,” so a daisy could represent a beautiful woman.
 To be imaginative, it is helpful to use images in your thinking rather than language. Practice thinking with imagery instead of with words. For example, if you are solving a math problem, visualize a specific number of objects (marbles, cars, etc.) rather than the numeral in front of you.If you are solving a problem in physics, imagine the specific objects in your word problem, such as a car driving fast or a tree falling.
Focus on the images of these objects rather than the numbers on the page.
 In analyzing literature, you are often asked to make connections in seemingly unrelated parts of the story. Doing this in other areas of life will force you to be imaginative. For example, you may look at a plant in your garden and realize that the way it functions is similar to the way your computer works.You may be able to solve problems by thinking of the problems in different contexts.
If you need to solve a problem at work, think of the problem in terms of farming or food instead.

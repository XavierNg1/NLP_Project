 Lunch break and after school can be a good time to practice lines. If you have to cry in your role, dance or sing, practice these in balance so that other aspects of your schoolwork don't fall behind. Collaborate with your fellow actors often when rehearsing in your breaks as that way you can get a good idea of their movements and manners and can gain some skills and ideas from them.


Your friends may become jealous of the fact that you got the main part, its best to involve them where you can in practicing, or to find out if they can join in in other ways.
 If you cannot make it because of your home duties, be sure to advise the teacher as well as other actors so they can fill in for you or reschedule.
 Be sure that you know where every prop that you use is prepared and where it will be. Leaving it to the last minute, if it is your responsibility, can cause big problems and will cause a lot of conflict within the cast and crew.

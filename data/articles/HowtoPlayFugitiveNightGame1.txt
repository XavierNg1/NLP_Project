 The cops and the fugitives.
 This is the destination that all the fugitives must make it back to without being caughtÂ by a cop.
 If a fugitive gets tagged by a cop before making it back to the "home base", they will go to jail. If a fugitive is tagged and put in jail, another fugitive from their team can tag them. If they succeed without being tagged by a cop, both fugitives get a free walk-back, meaning a cop cannot tag them while they walk away.

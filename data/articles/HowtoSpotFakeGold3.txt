 Rub a sample of the suspected gold or pyrite on an unglazed ceramic tile. A colored streak will be left behind similar to a pencil mark.


Fool's gold or pyrite will leave behind a greyish streak.
Real gold will leave a shiny golden streak.
 Determine the weight and volume of your sample. Use a digital scale to weigh the sample and record the mass in grams. Place the sample in a graduated container filled with water to determine the volume of displaced water. The volume the water level rises will indicate the volume of your sample (1 milliliter is equal to 1 cubic centimeter). Divide the mass by the volume.Pyrite has a density of 4.8-5 grams per cubic centimeter
Pure gold has a density of 19.3 grams per cubic centimeter.
 The hardness of a mineral can be determined by its ability to scratch or be scratched by an object. Try to scratch a copper penny with your suspected gold.


Real gold will not scratch a penny and can be scratched by the penny.
Fool's gold or pyrite will scratch a penny and cannot be scratched by the penny.

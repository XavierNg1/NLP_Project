 Laying down gives you a huge accuracy bonus, makes you harder to spot and, once spotted, makes you a lot harder to hit.;
, This will increase your accuracy due to the recoil that will cause your aim to jump after each shot. After each shot you will want to wait for a moment until your sights are back where they were. To change your shot mode you reselect your gun. Basically try to switch to your rifle when you are already wielding it and it will change your shot mode. You can see what shot mode you are on by looking at the very bottom right hand of your screen.
 The default key for this is the Right-mouse button, click it once. Aim your reticle towards the enemy player. Try to get it onto his chest or head depending on the range.
 When using an automatic weapon you will want to fire in bursts at your target, no more than 5 shots at a time. This really depends on your range though, you don't want to just hold down the trigger because the recoil of the gun will bounce your aim up and off of your target.

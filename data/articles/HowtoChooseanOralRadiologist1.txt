 If you have dental insurance, it's likely that only certain dentist offices are in your network. You can either start with your insurance's online tool to find a dentist or check for certain dentists once you've narrowed down a list., Using a database can help you easily narrow down your search. For instance, if you use the American Dental Association's tool, you can actually narrow your search to "Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology."However, if a dentist doesn't pop up under that specialty, try just searching for a dentist nearby. Most dentist offices do x-ray work in office.
 Look at reviews online to see if the dentist and radiologist have good reviews. Also, ask for recommendations from friends and family, as many may already have good dentists. Use factors like distance, services offered, and good reviews to make a list of a couple of dentists., Once you've narrowed down your choices to a few dentist offices, visit them and ask questions. You can also start out over the phone if you prefer. Of course, first and foremost on your mind is whether they offer x-rays, so establish that first. You can also schedule an appointment to meet the dentist and the radiologist. That way, you can size them up and see if you gel with the person.You can also ask questions about what other kinds of dental services they offer, as well as if they offer emergency services. You might also want to know what kind of sedation and numbing treatments they use.

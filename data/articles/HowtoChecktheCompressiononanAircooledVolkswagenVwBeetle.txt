Mark each wire with masking tape so you can put them back on the correct plugs later.

Be sure to turn the engine over six to eight times, same for each cylinder.
It is helpful to have a friend who can crank the engine.
Compression readings should be high compression (over 100 pounds) and relatively uniform among the cylinders (within 5 pounds). Variations from cylinder to cylinder should be no more than 14 to 20 pounds.


If the compression reading increases a little, the problem is probably worn, broken, or poorly seated piston rings.
If the compression reading remains the same, leaking or damaged valves may be at fault.


Use the 6" rubber breather hose as an extension to hand-thread the plug into its hole.
Turn the spark plug a turn or so to ensure it is not cross threaded.

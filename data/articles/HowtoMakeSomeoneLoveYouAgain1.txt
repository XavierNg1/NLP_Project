 It’s important that you’re self-aware in going into this. Do you want them to love you because you feel lonely, you miss them, you want to reconnect, or you want someone in your life? Do you regret your actions and want to deal with the guilt? Are you feeling disconnected and wanting more closeness?Imagine your ideal circumstance. If you know what you want from them, you might have a good reason to seek their love.
You may find out that you don't have a great reason. Maybe you miss how good it felt to be loved, but don't really want to get back together. In this case, leave them alone.
Be clear why you want this person’s love and help that motivate you to win their affection.;
, If you haven’t spoken in a bit, you may wish to reach out. While it’s okay to establish a connection through a text or message, make sure you speak in person. This way, nothing can get lost in translation and you can be in each other’s presence. If they are hesitant to see you, then wait some time and try again. If they agree to meet you, this is a promising first step.


See what it’s like to be with them and what emotions it brings up for both of you. Does it seem likely that you can win back their love?

, If you want to make someone love you again, make sure they are at least open to returning to a loving relationship with you. If they are distant or angry with you, don’t get your hopes up. You may need to give some space. If they have told you that being loving toward you won’t happen again, don’t try to convince them. Respect their decision and let them know that you are open to being in a loving relationship with them.If they are clear that they do not want to love you, say, “I respect your decision, even if I feel differently. Please know that this is what I want and I’m leaving the door open if you want to reconsider.”

, The backsplash is the section of the countertop that stands upright against the kitchen or bathroom wall.

Place the countertop on a sawhorse. The backsplash should be on top of the sawhorse. The actual countertop should be positioned perpendicular to the floor. The back side of the backsplash should be facing up.






Ensure that the sawhorse is high enough so that the countertop does not touch the ground.






Place a jig along the line that you want to cut. A jig is a straight piece of wood or metal that helps you cut straight when sawing. You can use an old piece of wood as a jig. The jig should lie on the portion of the backsplash that you will keep.






Hold the jig with one hand against the portion of the backsplash that you will keep.






Use a circular saw with the other hand to cut along the marked line. A circular saw is a round, electric-powered saw that may either be hand-held or mounted on a table.

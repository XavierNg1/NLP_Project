 Use an equal amount of yellow and blue to make green. If you use too much yellow, the color will be too bright. If you use too much blue, the color will be too dark.
 Slowly add red to the green until you've created a ruddy brown color. Add just a little red at first and continue to mix it in to darken the color.
 Add more red to warm up the brown, and add a bit more green to add a greener hue to the brown.

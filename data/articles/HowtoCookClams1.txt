 Preheat the saucepan over medium heat and add the butter.


Tilt the pan as the butter melts so that the entire bottom gets coated.;
, Add the minced garlic and cook, stirring frequently with a heat-resistant spatula, until the garlic turns a light brown or tan color.


Do not let the garlic blacken and burn. If the garlic becomes burnt, discard it and clean the butter from the pan before starting over.
 Pour a single layer of clams into the bottom of the saucepan and stir until the clams are coated with the garlic butter.


You will need to cook the clams in batches. Do not stack the clams on top of each other in the pan since doing so will make it difficult for any clams on the bottom layer to open.






Stirring and coating the clams helps to ensure that the heat will be evenly distributed.
 Add roughly 1/4 cup (60 mL) white wine per one dozen clams.


The wine adds flavor to the clams, but more importantly, it creates the steam needed to cook the meat and open the shells. It also decreases the heat in the pan.
 Let the clams cook for roughly 4 minutes before removing the cover. The clams are finished once they open.


Clams only open when they are completely cooked.






If any clams have not opened, remove the clams that have opened and continue cooking the unopened clams for another 1 to 2 minutes. If the clams still do not open, discard them, since they might be bad.






Avoid over-cooking the clams since doing so will cause them to become tough.
 Transfer the clams to a serving platter and enjoy immediately.


The clams will release clam juice upon opening. You can serve this clam juice with the clams, alongside pasta or fresh bread.

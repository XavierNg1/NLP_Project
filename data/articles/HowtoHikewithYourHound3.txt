 Always check your dog for ticks at the end of a hike. If you are camping overnight, check the dog each night. Ticks are small insects that attach themselves to skin. Be sure to look near your dogâ€™s backside, ears, and anywhere that the skin folds (such as the arm pit).


If you locate any ticks on your dog, you will have to remove them.
Be sure to check yourself for ticks as well!

, In addition to scouting for ticks, check your dog for any plant life. To avoid tangled hair and the potential for rashes and other allergic reactions, remove any prickles, burrs, thorns, or sticks that have become entangled in your dog's coat.Double-check your dog's eyes, ears and nose for seeds or prickles.
If you do find a problem that worries you, contact your vet.
 At the end of a hike, express your pleasure at how well your dog hiked and provide a small treat. This helps to establish a positive association for your dog, fosters additional bonding, and encourages good behavior on your next excursion.

If you can't find a log out button under your options menu, you may need to update your Instagram app. A bug in the 7.19 version released late March 2016 caused the log out button to disappear. This bug has been fixed in the latest version available now at the app store and the logout and add account buttons have been restored. If you're experiencing these issues first try updating your Instagram app. If using the older version and unable to update right now, the only way to log out on an iPhone or iPad is to uninstall and reinstall the Instagram app. You can also change your Instagram password to log out.;

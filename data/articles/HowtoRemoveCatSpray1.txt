 If you see your cat spray in the house or find a wet urine stain, blot the spot with a clean towel immediately. This will soak up as much urine as possible, diminishing the possibility of the pee soaking into your rug or upholstery., Get a bowl of warm water, and put a few drops of mild soap in it. Use a clean towel to wipe the wet spot with the soapy water, blotting with a dry towel. You can do this a few times until no traces of the original cat spray remain.
 Sprinkle the damp spot with a few tablespoons of baking soda, which is a natural cleaning agent. Spread the soda evenly. Be careful not to use more than Â¼ cup (120 grams), as excessive amounts can be more difficult to clean up. Let your baking soda sit on the peed spot overnight.Baking soda is non-toxic and is an ingredient in most kitty liters. If your cat seems interested in eating the baking soda, however, you can block off the area to keep your cat away., If your cat sprayed the carpet, use a full-size vacuum to clean up the baking soda the next morning. Go over the area as many times as necessary to suck up all the powder, so the area is clean to the touch. If your cat peed a mattress or another upholstered surface, use a handheld vacuum to clean up the baking soda.
 Even after cleaning up the area, some traces of urine will likely remain. Use an enzyme-based cleaner to eliminate any remaining traces of spray. Fully saturate the area, and allow the cleaner to air dry.

 Keep facial spray in a small spray bottle of about 3 or 4 ounces. Even this small amount can last quite awhile, depending on how much you use the spray, and will prevent the ingredients from spoiling over longer periods of time.


Adjust the recipes for facial spray according to your size of spray bottle. If you make too much, consider storing it for a short period of time or giving some away as a gift.
You can find small plastic spray bottles for this purpose in the travel items section of most big-box stores. Some prefer glass bottles to prevent the possibility of leaching from plastic.
 After combining ingredients in your spray bottle, keep face sprays in the fridge to make them extra cool and refreshing before use. This will also help to preserve the ingredients.


You may want to keep a face spray meant for relaxation by your bed where it is convenient to use before sleep. If you still want to keep it cool, put it in the fridge during the day and pull it out in time for bed.
Pack facial spray into a cooler with any food and beverages you might be taking out to the beach, pool, etc. That way your spray will remain cool for use throughout your day in the sun.
 Use your facial spray anytime you need a little pick-me-up or extra moisture. Some like to spritz it on in the morning to wake up and even help set makeup, while others like using it as a fragrance for evening or to calm down before bed.


A cooling spray would be great for use during or after spending time outside in the sun or in other hot environments.
You might use a relaxing spray after a long day or before bed to help you fall asleep.

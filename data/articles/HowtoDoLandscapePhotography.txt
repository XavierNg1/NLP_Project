If the sky is partly cloudy, the best time to take a photo is when the cloud just sits on the horizon., Try sitting or crouching or taking a few steps in either direction. Angle the camera a bit, trying to capture different pieces of landscape., If you are trying to capture just a select image with only one layer, that is beyond the scope of this guide.,, The best time to capture a photo is either early in the day or near sunset.

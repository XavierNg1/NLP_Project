 To do so, either click the Windows logo in the bottom-left corner of the screen, or press the âŠž Win key.


On Windows 8, you'll instead hover your mouse in the top-right corner of the screen, then click the magnifying glass icon.;
, This will bring up the Command Prompt icon at the top of the Start window.
 It's a black box at the top of the Start window. Doing so invokes a drop-down menu.


If you're on a computer that doesn't have right/left mouse buttons, tap the trackpad with two fingers instead.
 It's at the top of the drop-down menu.


You can't change your computer's time and date without administrator privileges.
 Command Prompt will open with your cursor ready to type.
 Be sure to leave a space after the word "time", since the time-stamp must be separate from the command.
 For example:



5:30 PM would be written as time 05:30:00 PM


3:30 and 30 seconds AM would be written as time 03:30:30 AM.
 The clock is in the bottom-right corner of your computer's taskbar. You should see the time change almost immediately.
 Again, leave a space after "date" for the time-stamp.
 For example:



January 7th, 2003 would be written as date 01/07/2003.

December 14th, 2017 would be written as date 12/14/2017.
 The date is directly beneath the time in the bottom-right corner of the screen. It should reflect the date you just entered.

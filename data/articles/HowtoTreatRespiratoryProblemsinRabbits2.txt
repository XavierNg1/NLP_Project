 Surprisingly, dental problems can cause respiratory problems. When the bones in your rabbit’s mouth start breaking down, the tooth roots (located above the gum line) of the molars and/or incisors get pushed into the skull bones. These roots could block the tear ducts, causing runny eyes. The blocked tear ducts could also get plugged with mucus and bacteria.Dental problems typically occur in older rabbits.Treating the dental problem may be extensive. For example, your vet may need to remove the problem teeth.Treating dental problems in rabbits require surgery.
While your rabbit is anesthetized, your vet will also do a nasolacrimal flush.This technique will help clear out the plugged tear ducts.
 Sometimes, a foreign object will get stuck in rabbit’s upper airway, causing a chronic runny nose. A nasal tumor can also obstruct the upper airway. Your vet will use different imaging techniques (x-ray, endoscopy) to locate the obstruction, then perform surgery to remove it.If your vet finds a tumor in your rabbit’s lungs, surgical removal may not be possible.


Endoscopy involves using a long tube with a small camera on the end. Your vet would slide the tube through your rabbit’s nose to find the obstruction.
 After your vet has performed surgery, they will give you specific instructions to care for your rabbit at home. For example, you will give your rabbit antibiotics. Since your rabbit will probably have some pain after surgery, you will also need to give your rabbit pain medication.


Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can provide pain relief in rabbits. Examples of rabbit-safe NSAIDs are aspirin and carprofen.Follow all prescription instructions carefully.

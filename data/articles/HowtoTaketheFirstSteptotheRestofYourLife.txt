, To start making changes...to progress, you need to do something. That something could be:

Jogging/marching/walking. Try doing this for just a couple of minutes.







Dance to a song...the whole song. Do this, even if you have to finish it by walking in place.






Walk around the neighborhood...your cul-de-sac, to the mailbox, anything like that.






The intent is to set an objective, accomplish it and know that you did it.
The act of doing this daily will accomplish two things.

Provide the priceless feeling of knowing you did it.
Increase your stamina.
, Just pick yourself up and continue. Even the best gymnast stumbles.


As your physical and emotional stamina improve, so will your mind.
 Almost as much, or maybe even more, as your body needs the increased activity, so will your mind.
 Find one thing that really catches your eye.
 You have one goal: Tame one step at a time. Without any type of warm-ups, all that any giant stride will accomplish will be an injury, whether it is physical or emotional.


Increase as you can. Try:

Moving in place for longer times.
Pick a faster or longer song.
If that's too easy, try adding swinging arms to your job.

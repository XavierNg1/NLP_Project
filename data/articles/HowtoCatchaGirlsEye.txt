 You can't look like a pig and want to attract a girl at the same time.;
, She might have just started to like you and you spoil everything by picking your nose or farting in front of her! Girls more than likely will not want to be near someone disgusting.
 Always clean your armpits and make sure no smell is coming out of them.
 Girls don't ever like to see tiny mustaches or tiny beards. (There is a small exception to this rule - When you get to the point that you could grow a goatee or beard, if her father treats her well and has facial hair, it may be an attractive thing to her.) Also, try to wear your hair a little long, but not pass the jawline or you will come off as not taking care of yourself, never shave your head. You'll just look like a baseball. (Yet again, this is "fudge-able" too. If you can confidently look like a baseball, you can still be attractive. Just don't do it to be a poser)

, A good smelling guy always gets the girl's attention, even if they don't see your face.
 Never say anything rude or bad or swear and never talk about sex or anything related to it. Remember, no matter how ugly you are, she'll always admire you as long as you're polite. Just behave like a true gentleman for once!

, Say she's wearing a t-shirt with your favorite band on it, that would be a good conversation starter! Note: NEVER try to like something that she likes just to have something in common. If she likes something, you can check it out, but don't pretend to like it. You could get hooked into going to a Britney Spears concert or something.

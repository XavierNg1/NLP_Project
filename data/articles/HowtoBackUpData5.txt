 There are several free cloud services available that you can use as an always-online backup location for your files. These include Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Apple iCloud, DropBox, and more. These services all come with a fair amount of space for free, and can be upgraded with more space for a fee.


There are also cloud-based backup services that charge an annual fee. These are often more directly focused towards backing up, and include scheduling options. These include CrashPlan+, Carbonite, Mozy, Backblaze, Acronis, and more.
 If you are using a free service, it will be up to you to maintain your backups. Manually add the files to your service much like you would to an external hard drive. Some services such as OneDrive and Google Drive will give you a folder that you can place on your desktop. Anything added to this folder will be synced with your cloud storage.
 While the amount of space you get for signing up may seem like a lot, you may find that it goes quickly once you start adding your pictures and videos. Be careful to backup only your most necessary files, and go through your files on the cloud occasionally and cull the old versions.

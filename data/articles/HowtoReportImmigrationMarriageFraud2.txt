 What stage of the process your spouse is in will dictate what you can do to remove your support.If you've been married for over two years and your spouse already has his permanent green card, you have far fewer options than if the marriage was more recent.However, if your visa petition has not yet been approved, you can simply withdraw it and your spouse will not be able to continue immigration., If your visa petition was approved, you probably had to sign an affidavit of support, Form I-864, so your spouse could get a green card.


This document is a legally binding contract between yourself and the U.S. government in which you agreed to financially support your immigrant spouse.
If you don't withdraw this document, you will still be liable for your spouse's support, even if you get divorced and possibly even if you get the marriage annulled.Your spouse would need your cooperation here to get his green card. So if you withdraw your affidavit and refuse any further support, your spouse's immigration process would be stalled if not halted.However, keep in mind that if your spouse already has his green card, you likely cannot affect his immigration status simply by withdrawing support. Despite this, consider withdrawing your affidavit anyway simply to avoid further legal liability.You probably should withdraw all petitions or affidavits you've filed on behalf of your spouse or any of his family members to ensure that you no longer have continuing legal or financial responsibility for them. Simply ending the marriage will not terminate your responsibility for them., If you've withdrawn your joint Form I-751 Petition to Remove the Conditions of Permanent Residence, you should refuse to attend any scheduled interviews.


Keep in mind that your spouse may file a new form asking for a waiver of the joint filing requirement.However, to be successful with such a waiver, your spouse would have to prove that the marriage was bona fide to begin with.

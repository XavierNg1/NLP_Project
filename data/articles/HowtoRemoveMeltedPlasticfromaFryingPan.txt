 Leave it to chill for at least a couple of hours so that when you take out the pan, the plastic must have hardened.;
, You can use anything with some heft, but it should be softer than the metal of the frying pan.
 Make sure the plastic has hardened.
 Its better to do this job on floor that kitchen shelves. Whatever surface it is, it should be able to withstand a great amount of force.
 Do not tap too hard. It can cause damage to the pan.
 Be patient with this job. Gradually the plastic will separate from the pan. Once it is removed, wash the pan before any use.

 Use a tie that you won’t be wearing anymore. The tie should be 100% silk. A tie made of any other material won’t work. Choose a tie that has an interesting pattern. Dark purple, blue, and red ties work the best.It doesn't necessarily have to be a beautiful tie. “Uglier” ties sometimes make the most beautiful eggs.
If you don't have any ties laying around, silk ties can be found cheap at most thrift shops.
 This should double the size of your tie, which will give you a piece large enough to work with. Cut out a section that can easily wrap around your egg. You'll need a section of the material that wraps around the egg and can be held together. Leave about five centimeters of excess fabric., Wrap the egg in the tie. The right side of the tie material (the side you would see if you were wearing it) should directly touch the egg. Wrap the egg as tightly as possible without breaking the egg.The folds in the fabric will form a swirly pattern.
 Use a twisty tie to secure the fabric at the top of the egg. A string works, too, but a twisty tie is much easier to work with. Secure on the long side of the egg if you want the opposite end of the egg to show the pattern the best. Tie the egg horizontally if you want the wide side of the egg to show the design., Use a lightweight and lightly colored fabric. You can use a pillowcase, thin dish cloth, or sheet. Wrap the fabric tightly around the egg, and secure it with another twisty tie., Put the egg in a pot. Cover it with water. Add 1/4 cup (50 g) of vinegar. Boil for about 20 minutes. Then, take them off the heat and put them in a colander or on a towel to dry., Give them about ten minutes to cool down before you touch them. Then, remove the fabric. Be careful when handling the freshly dyed eggs.

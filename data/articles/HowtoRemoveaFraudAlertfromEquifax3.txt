 Certain credit monitoring products available through Equifax have an automatic alert feature.


If you've purchased an Equifax credit monitoring product, you can find out if you have free access to the automatic alerts feature by logging in and reviewing your account information in the Member Center., After you log in to your Equifax account, click the alerts tab at the top of the page to review the status of your alerts and manage your preferences.The alerts tab is located in your account's Member Center., If you scroll down and click the button to deactivate automatic alerts, any pending automatic alerts or alert renewals will be cancelled.


If you have any existing alerts, they will expire at the end of the initial 90-day period. Since you deactivated automatic alerts, they will no longer automatically renew. The actual date those alerts expire will be shown.If you want to remove any existing alerts that were placed on your account automatically, you can do so by sending a written request to Equifax Information Service LLC, PO Box 105069, Atlanta, GA 30348-5069.Since information regarding any initial fraud alert that was automatically renewed also was sent to the other two credit bureaus, if you want an existing fraud alert removed after deactivating automatic alerts, you should also contact the other two credit bureaus.

 Your teachers will be more likely to trust you if your grades are good and if you put in the effort to study and complete all your homework on time. Ask them questions, attend tutoring sessions, and show them that you put a lot of effort into your studies, and they will appreciate it and like you more.;
, Don't spend the whole class talking to your friends, texting, or sleeping - this shows disrespect for your teachers and their time. Instead, pay attention, ask questions, work hard, and your teacher will be sure to appreciate your efforts.
 Always bring your books, homework, pens and other equipment you'll need, as well as finished and correct homework. Keep your backpack organized and have a few extra pencils and other necessities, to be even more prepared.
 Bake themed cookies or bring in brownies for Halloween, Christmas, and other holidays. Decorate them with images from the occasion, like pumpkins for Halloween and snowflakes for the winter holidays. Share them with your class, or just bring them for your teacher. If you aren't a good chef, try arts and crafts. Make them a card or try some origami. They really appreciate the thought of a homemade gift.
 Talk to your teacher after class and ask questions that go beyond the material you learn in class. For instance, tell your English teacher that you really enjoyed the book you read in class, and ask for recommendations of other, similar books to read. Share your interests with your teacher and ask about theirs. This will help you establish a relationship that goes beyond the classroom and class material, and will help make your teacher like you.

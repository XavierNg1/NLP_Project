 Bring to a boil with 1 cup water and 1 teaspoon soy sauce in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan, then reduce heat to very low and simmer, tightly covered, until all of the water is absorbed, about 40 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the rice stand, covered, 10 minutes. While the rice is standing, stir together the vinegar and the remaining teaspoon of soy sauce.;
, Sprinkle with vinegar mixture, tossing gently with a large spoon to combine. Cool the rice, tossing occasionally, about 15 minutes. Stir together with the wasabi and the remaining teaspoon of water to form a stiff paste. Let stand at least 15 minutes (to allow the flavors to develop).
 Arrange one sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the mat, lining up a long edge of sheet with edge of mat nearest you.


Using damp fingers, gently press half of rice (about 3/4 cup) onto nori in one layer, leaving a 1 3/4-inch border on side farthest from you.
Arrange half of the cucumber in an even strip horizontally across rice, starting 1 inch (2.5Â cm) from side nearest you. (You may need to cut pieces to fit from side to side.)

, Peel the avocado half and cut lengthwise into thin slices, then arrange half of slices just above carrot in same manner. Repeat with radish sprouts, letting some sprout tops extend beyond the edge.
 Then fold the mat over the filling so that the upper and lower edges of the rice meet. Squeeze gently but firmly along length of roll, tugging edge of mat farthest from you to tighten. (The nori border will still be flat on the mat.)

, The moisture from the rice will seal the roll.
 Make a second log in same manner, then cut each log crosswise into 6 pieces with a wet thin-bladed knife.
 Accompany with wasabi paste, soy sauce, and ginger.

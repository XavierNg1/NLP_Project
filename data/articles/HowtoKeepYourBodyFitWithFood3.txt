 Choosing unprocessed foods allows you to control your diet by eliminating "hidden" ingredients and excess salt.It's possible that weight gain may be coming not from the quantity of food you are eating, but the amount of sugar, salt, and other ingredients that are added to your meal. Whole foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and fish also tend to reside near the healthy "base" of the food pyramid.
 Studies indicate that children who participate in school-based gardening programs are twice as likely to try new foods as those who did not participate in these programs.Nurturing your own vegetables from seeds or seedlings will inspire you toward healthy eating. Growing your own vegetables also saves money, allowing you to keep your body fit without breaking your budget.
 Much like consuming whole foods, cooking from scratch improves your control over your diet. Not only are you likely to save money by preparing your own meals, but you can eliminate additives, extra sugar and salt, and other processed ingredients.


Develop your cooking skills gradually. You may become overwhelmed if you try to take on too much, too quickly. Start with easy recipes to increase your confidence. Give yourself permission to learn over time and you'll find cooking is more likely to become an enduring habit.

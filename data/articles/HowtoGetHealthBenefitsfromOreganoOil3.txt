 Because oregano is from the same family of plants as mint, thyme, basil, and sage, individuals with allergies to any of these herbs may experience a similar reaction to oregano.If you have a sensitivity to any member of this family of plants, proceed cautiously with oregano oil, starting with a single dose of very low concentration until you know how your body will react.
 Because oregano oil may interfere with iron absorption and can impact blood clotting, oregano oil should only be used for short-term treatments of targeted conditions.Oregano oil is not a recommended daily supplement, even for individuals who suffer from chronic bowel inflammation or long-term gastrointestinal problems, unless it has been prescribed by a health professional.
 If use of oregano oil induces vomiting, skin rashes, swelling, irritation, or difficulty breathing, consult a health professional. Even natural oils have significant medicinal properties and can cause serious health complications when administered incorrectly or to individuals with an intolerance for the plantâ€™s compounds.

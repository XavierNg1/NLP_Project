 Compete with one another, share tips, and give each other pep-talks when motivation levels are low.
 There are plenty of communities online, like MyFitnessPal, which help you track your progress and meet other people with whom you can exchange tips, stories, and encouragement.
 This will serve as a visual reminder of the potential benefits of all your hard work.
 Getting in shape is tough. If you feel like giving up, visualize yourself after you reach your goal, and imagine how accomplished you will feel.

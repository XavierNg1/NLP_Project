 Whether a lip gloss leaked or you got some butter on your purse at a restaurant, these greasy stains are stubborn. Cornstarch is your secret weapon. The cornstarch works by soaking the oil right out of the stain., When you’ve fully covered the stain, pat it into the suede gently. Then, let the cornstarch sit and work its magic. After at least an hour, gently shake the purse over a trashcan so the cornmeal comes off.As the cornstarch falls away, hopefully so does that pesky oil stain.
 Brushing will remove the remnants of cornstarch. It will also blend out the area so it doesn’t stand out from the rest of the purse. If everything has gone perfectly, you won’t be able to tell that there was ever a stain.

 If you opt to drink alcohol, drink in moderation. This means no more than one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men.A drink is defined as 12 ounces (355 milliliters) of beer, 5 ounces (148 milliliters) of wine, or 1.5 ounces (44 milliliters) of distilled spirits.
 If possible, you should opt to drink liquor neat. Mixers, such as juice and soda, often contain a lot of extra calories and sugar. Drinking liquor straight is a low-calorie option to have a drink at the end of the day without it being too unhealthy.If you dislike the taste of straight liquor, go for flavored seltzer water or diet sodas as mixers.
 Wine is a low-calorie, low-carb option. If you dislike hard liquor, go for a glass of wine instead to reduce your caloric intake. Wine also may have health benefits due to its antioxidants. While studies are inconclusive, there is some evidence wine can lower bad cholesterol levels., Beer is generally not a healthy option as it's high in calories and carbs. If you do drink beer, stick to one or two beers. Always go for light beers, which are lower in overall calories.

 Apply pressure on one of the narrow sections. Run your finger nail in the creases, and on the top edge so you can plainly see the shape. Place a dot on the three corners.;
, Using a ruler, connect all the dots. Using the ruler again, draw another line 1/8″ inside the previously drawn line. This will be your cutting line. This is step is important. 

, Place a # 2 on the other side of the pattern.
 You will be cutting two pattern pieces out of each sheet you select. 


Cut 5 shapes from each paper, using pattern side # 1. 
Turn the pattern over to the #2 side.
Cut another five shapes from each of the papers.
Count the resulting cut papers. You should have 10 shapes. Five should match pattern side #1 and five should match pattern side #2.
 Each pattern will be placed across from each other on the star. Place them around the star loosely. Do you like what you see? Move them around until you're satisfied. 

, Do one section at a time.Using the sponge brush, dip into the Mod Podge and apply it to a section of the star. 


If needed, touch the brush to a bit of water, not much to help it to spread with greater ease.
Don’t worry if you get the Mod Podge on other surfaces. Just wipe it off.
 This product dries quickly, so you need to move quickly. Leave a 1/8″ metal boarder showing,  Don’t go too “nuts” with this; just get it as close as you can.
 When you’re done,  allow the Mod Podge to dry for about 20 minutes.
 If it's to be used outdoors, use the outdoor version.
 You will need from 24″ to 36″ of ribbon depending upon the size of your star. You can just use ribbon you have on hand. 


You can purchase some fancy Christmas Ribbon if you want. 
If your star is the largest one, use a wide ribbon, at least 1 1/2″ wide.

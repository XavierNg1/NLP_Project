 Then you want to let the hair dry most of the way. However, it has to be damp for the curls to set., Once your hair is mostly dry, brush or comb it through. You will need perfectly brushed or combed hair for the curls to be smooth., There should be a huge section at the top, and a teeny one at the bottom. You can do this with your fingers or with a comb., Make your first curl by taking a section of your hair and wrapping it around your finger. Then, secure the curl against your scalp with a clip or bobby pin.Continue to make curls until all of your hair is pinned in curls against your scalp.
 You can apply heat to speed up this process or just wait for your hair to air dry. When your hair is dry, remove the clips or pins and allow your curls to unfurl.You can also run your fingers through them to fan them out, but do not brush them.
Set the look with a little hairspray if desired.

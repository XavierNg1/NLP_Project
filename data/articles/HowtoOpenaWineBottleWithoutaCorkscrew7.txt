 Ideally, you will want the nails to reach just to the bottom of the cork.
 Hammer them straight down and form a line with the nails. Keep the nails in close proximity to each other. Donâ€™t hammer too hard or you could break the cork into pieces.
 It should grip them tightly to allow for removal.
 Simply pull on the hammer and gradually move the cork towards you. You can gently rock it back and forth to help with removal. You can also use the hammer and nails to hold the cork in place and twist the bottle away from you to separate the cork from the bottle.








If at first the cork does not come out, hammer nails in again in a line perpendicular to the original line and try again.

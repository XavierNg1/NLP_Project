  Do not eat junk food.  If you want to eat it, only eat a little bit, and never replace healthy, balanced meals with junk food.  Only snack on junk food in moderation.  Eat foods from all the food groups, and try to get the recommended daily servings for your age.  Fruits and veggies should be eaten often, and water too!;
,  Be physically active for at least one hour a day.  It doesn't have to be all at once, you can spread your exercise throughout the day.  For example, go outside and ride your bike for 15 minutes.  Swing on the swing set at the park for 15 minutes, and play a 30 minute game of soccer!  Exercising will improve your health a lot.
  It is recommended that you get 10-11 hours of sleep nightly. Without sleep, you become less energetic, you get dark circles and unhealthily pale skin, and you just feel a lot drowsier.  8 hours of sleep minimum, will pay off!

 Radiotherapy involves using x-rays or radioactive emissions to treat cancer. Radiotherapy is indicated for cancers on the outside of the body, such as a tumor affecting the face or a limb extremity.


These are specialist treatments and are undertaken at specialist centers, therefore it is likely you'll need to travel with your pet to access radiotherapy. A typical radiotherapy protocol involves four to six weekly treatments, with the obvious implication that the dog needs a weekly anesthetic. On the plus side, radiotherapy can produce a dramatic reduction in size of some aggressive tumors, and either buy the dog more time or reduce the lump to a size that it can be surgically removed.
The animal has to lie exceedingly still and so radiotherapy is always done under general anesthesia.
 These therapies involve the application of extreme cold or extreme heat in order to destroy cancerous tissue. Neither therapy is in wide usage, as the type of tumor that is treated with cryosurgery or heat surgery is often just surgically removed.Healing after cryosurgery or heat surgery involves the lump dying and being sloughed off over time.
 There are a wide variety of alternative treatments that can potentially be used on dog cancer. While the success rates and effectiveness of many of these treatments is up to debate, it is worth a try if other treatments are not working or you are not able to pay for them.


For example, one successful alternative treatment that utilizes a mushroom used in Chinese medicine has been used to treat a specific blood cancer.

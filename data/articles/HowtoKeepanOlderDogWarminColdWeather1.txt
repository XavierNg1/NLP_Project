 Certain breeds of dogs will be more affected by the cold than others. Determine your breed’s susceptibility to the cold in order to know which precautions you need to take. Older dogs will always be a bit more sensitive than younger dogs of the same breed.In general, the larger your dog is, the better they will be at tolerating the cold.
The amount of fur your dog has plays a role as well. Breeds like malamutes, huskies, and chow chows, with thick coats, are particularly well suited for cold weather. Dogs with short hair, like chihuahuas, are quite sensitive to the cold.;
, One common and easy way to help keep your dog warm is to give them a dog sweater or jacket. These garments can help to keep your dog’s core warm and keep them comfortable. This can be a great option for older dogs who have trouble staying warm.Dog clothing is available at pet stores, specialty stores, and online.
Be sure to keep your dog’s clothing warm and dry. Damp sweaters or jackets can actually make your dog colder.
 An additional level of protection is to place warm booties on your dog’s feet. This can be especially helpful if your dog dislikes walking on the cold ground, or if you notice cracking or bleeding from their paws. This discomfort can be quite common in older animals, so consider placing booties on your senior dog., Senior dogs will be able to tolerate cold weather for short period of time, but is best not to overdo it. If the temperature is low or the conditions are wet and icy, consider taking a shorter walk than you would normally. Alternatively, if your dog can wait, you may postpone your walk until the weather clears up.It is a good idea to check the temperature before going out.If it is below freezing, you may want to postpone your walk.

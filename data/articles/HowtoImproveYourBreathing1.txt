 Although most of us are able to breathe through our mouths, you should always favor breathing in through your nose. Your nose is specifically designed for the intake of air and will help filter out particles and dust.Your nose has thin hairs and mucous that will help keep the air entering your lungs clean.
Breathing in through your mouth may cause your mouth and throat to dry out.
Your nose produces a gas called nitric oxide that enhances your immune systemand may even increase the oxygenation of your blood.;
, Either due to bad breathing habits or from being under stress, many people take quick and shallow breaths. Breathing provides vital oxygen to the body, and these short breaths don't carry as much oxygen as deeper and slower breathing will.Inhale through your nose.
Imagine you are filling your belly up with air. At the start of the breath, your stomach should rise first, before your chest.
When your stomach is “full” continue the inhalation, allowing the chest to rise now.
Take your time breathing in. A good breath should last around five seconds on the inhalation.
 Just as with inhaling, exhalations of the breath should be done slowly. Exhaling too quickly lessens the time that our lungs can intake oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.

Exhale through your mouth. You can try pursing your lips to slow the exhalation.Let the lungs push the air out at their own pace. Try not to force air out of your lungs.
Start the exhalation at the stomach level, letting your diaphragm relax first. Your chest should fall with or after your stomach does.
Don't rush the exhalation. Just like with the inhalation, you should take a few seconds to exhale.

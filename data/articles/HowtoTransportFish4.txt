 After you have secured the fish and the plants, place 80 percent of the tank water into a fish-safe bucket or bags. This water should be gotten from the top of the tank, not near the bottom. This limits the amount of waste you take with you., If you have rocks and other decorations in your tank, place them in a bag filled with water from the tank. This will preserve the beneficial bacteria that has grown on the ornaments.Don't transport these things in the tank. The tank could crack if it is moved with items inside it.
 The way you transport your filter media depends on how far you will be going. For short moves where the tank will not be separated for long, place the filter media in a clean, chemical-free, sealed container. Donâ€™t clean it.For long moves, you can clean the filter and reintroduce it when you arrive at the destination. You may also want to throw it away and buy a new one.
 When you arrive at your destination, you should put your tank back together like it was before. Place decorations and rocks into the tank, and then fill it with the water you kept from the tank. Replace all the filters, heaters, and pumps. Then, place the live plants back in the aquarium.

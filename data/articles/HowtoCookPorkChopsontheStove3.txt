 Add the vegetable or olive oil to the skillet and heat over medium-high until the oil becomes glossy and smooth enough to easily coat the entire pan.
 Sprinkle both sides of the chops with equal amounts of salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning blend. Gently pat the chops to rub the seasonings into the meat.
 Cook the chops for 2 minutes on each side in the hot oil, or until each side is notably browned.


The process of searing and braising pork chops on the stove can go a long way in preventing the meat from drying out. The seared surface locks in more of the pork's natural moisture, while the braising liquid infuses the meat with additional moisture as it cooks.
 Pour the broth into the pan and bring it to a steady boil.


Let the chops sit in the broth at a full boil for 30 to 60 seconds before proceeding. This way, the broth will have plenty of time to reach a good heat.
 Cover and reduce the heat to medium-low. Let the chops simmer for about 20 to 25 minutes.To accurately determine whether or not the pork chops are safe to eat, check the center of the thickest chop with a meat thermometer. The internal temperature of pork chops must reach at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius) before the pork is safe to eat.
If you do not have a meat thermometer, you can determine if the pork chops are done by cutting into the center of the thickest cut. If the meat is white, it is likely safe to eat.
Note, however, that if you use a braising liquid that has color to it, the color of the liquid can tint the meat. As long as the inside of the pork does not look pink and “rubbery,” however, it should be safe to eat.
 Let the pork chops rest for roughly 3 minutes before placing on individual serving plates and enjoying.

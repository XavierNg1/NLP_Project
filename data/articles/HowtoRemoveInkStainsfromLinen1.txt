 An alcohol-based hairspray is best. Aerosol cans typically spray more evenly than pump hairspray, so you may want to choose an aerosol brand, but either kind will work. The hairspray will help loosen the ink from the linen fibers.This method can be used for clothing or other linen items, such as couches.;
, You want to give the hairspray time to work, so don’t spray the stain and then start blotting immediately. Wait up to ten minutes to allow the ingredients in the hairspray to react with the ink., You should be able to see the ink coming to the surface of the fabric. Gently blot the ink away. Don’t rub, or you risk spreading the ink stain and further damaging the fabric., Be sure all the ink has been removed before washing. Linen can be washed regularly, in your washing machine. Just be sure to separate your “lights” from “darks” to ensure dye doesn’t bleed onto your light-colored clothing., Hang your garment or lay it flat. Using a clothes dryer will not only shrink your linen but could set the stain if you did not remove it completely.

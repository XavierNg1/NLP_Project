 Some fitness centers post the amount of weight lost by group members or teams each week. Others choose to be more discreet, only revealing whether weight was lost or gained.
 You can choose winners based on pounds lost or percentage of body weight lost.
 Club members’ original weights as well as their weekly changes need to be recorded by an objective person who is not participating in the contest.
 Participants can weigh themselves while wearing everyday clothing or while wearing workout gear. Club members can also decide whether or not they want to wear shoes when they are weighing in.
 You can use a scale at a gym, or you can use a scale at a doctor’s office. You can also purchase an electronic scale as long as members all use the same equipment for their weigh-in.

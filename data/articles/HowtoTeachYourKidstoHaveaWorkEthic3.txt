 Never fell a child that he or she does not work as hard as another child. This can cause problems between siblings. This can also be discouraging to the child who was criticized. Focus on each child individually and look for improvements in his or her effort., It will take time for your child to get the hang of doing chores the right way and on time. If you see that your child is trying their best, encourage them to get better instead of punishing them. For example, if your child leaves food on some of the dishes they washed, tell them that you appreciate their effort and show them how to wash dishes again. Being overly critical can cause your child to resent chores and have a bad attitude towards them.Kids learn at their own rate and it will take time for them to master new chores.
 Your child may not be able to make the connection between work ethic and their chores on their own. Once you assign a chore, explain the reason why the chore needs to be done and how that chore contributes to the family.For example, if your child is responsible for taking the trash out, explain that the trash goes out to keep the home clean and to keep the house from smelling bad.


Also explain the consequences of not doing assigned chores.

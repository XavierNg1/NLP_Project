Foods with high levels of resistant starches include:Cooked potatoes
Beans
Flaxseeds
Oats
Legumes
Bananas

, Refined wheat is wheat that does not have bran or germ, two important parts of the wheat grain kernel. This produces a wheat that lacks fiber, iron, and B vitamins in the same proportions which occur in whole grains.Wheat products made with refined wheat – like white bread, most bagels, and other processed foods – will leave you feeling less full, thus leading to higher caloric intake., They’re also in abundance in soda, where they take the form of high fructose corn syrup. But these carbs provide no nutritional benefit, and make it more likely you’ll gain weight. Avoid these added sugars to reduce your intake of bad carbs.To identify which foods have added sugar, check the ingredients label.
Whole foods – fruits and veggies – do not have added sugar unless they’re canned or otherwise packaged.

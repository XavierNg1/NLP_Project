Example: A man is pushing a 10kg box on a rough floor, with a coefficient of friction of µ = 0.6, by applying a 20N force. You will select our body to be the box.;
,


Example: Make a square to represent the box.



Example: These are (1) the weight of the object, (2) the pushing force of the man, (3) the normal force applied by the floor, and (4) the friction force due to the rough floor.
 Always start with the weight because all objects have weight.


Example: (1) For the weight, draw an arrow pointing downward because the weight is the pulling force of the earth's gravity, which is always downward.



Example: (2) Draw an arrow that follows the direction of the pushing force. (3) Draw an arrow pointing upward for the normal force because it should always be perpendicular to the floor. (4) Draw an arrow that is opposite the direction of motion of the box for the friction.
 However, if you wish to put the magnitude of the forces, you may continue to the following steps.
 The weight of the object is equal to mass of object*acceleration due to gravity.


Example: W = m*a. W = (10kg)*(9.81m/s^2) = 98.1N. Write this beside its respective arrow.
Note: Forces are measured in Newtons or N.
 The magnitude of the pushing force applied by the man is given as 20N. Write this beside its respective arrow.
 The normal force is equal to the magnitude of the weight that acts perpendicularly to the floor. In this case, all of the weight is acting perpendicularly to the floor, therefore, N and W are equal in magnitude. So, N = 98.1N. Write this beside its respective arrow.
 The friction force is given by the formula: f=µ*N. Therefore, f = 0.6*(98.1N) = 58.86N. Write this beside its respective arrow.


Now that all forces are represented with their direction and magnitude, your FBD is ready for further engineering or physics analysis!

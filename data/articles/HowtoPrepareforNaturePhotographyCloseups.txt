 You want one that you can set up close to the ground that isn't too intrusive. It may not be enough to support your camera in normal circumstances, but for quick closeups on the ground, it is perfect.;
, Face it...you will probably be crawling on the ground. Trying to get the right angle, perspective, or view. Being in shorts or a dress will get you scraped up and dirty.
 While your camera may have auto focus, sometimes, it is hard to get the right focus because everything is very similar in color.
 If you don't mind the extra weight, carry a longer one. You never know when you will see something that you want a closeup shot on that you can't reach.
 Usually where there is one, there is the other.


Your backyard or a park with a good amount of shade is a great place to start!

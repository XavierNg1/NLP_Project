 This one involves some three digit numbers, so most people will not want to do the math in their head. Warn the volunteer that he will need to do long division.
 Tell him to hide the paper from you to prove you're not cheating. Ask him to write a 3-digit number that repeats the same digit three times.


For example, he could write 222.
 Now your volunteer should treat each of the three digits as a separate number, and find their sum.


For example, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
 He should now take the 3-digit number, and divide it by the smaller one. Give him some time to work this out.



222 / 6 = 37,

, As long as your volunteer followed the instructions correctly, his answer will always be 37.

Brace it gently and use the tip of your knife to cut cleanly down the side to open it up.Gently pull open the pepper; remove and discard the core.Be careful when pulling open the pepper- the seeds inside are small and will scatter easily.

Remove and discard the remaining seeds and ribs, flattening it as you move along., Brace the rectangle-shaped piece of pepper with one hand and grasp the handle of your knife firmly with the other hand. With each cut, bring the knife down, touching the tip to the top corner of the rectangle.

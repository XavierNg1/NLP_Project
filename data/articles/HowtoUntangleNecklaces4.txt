 Dab some drops of Windex onto the knotted parts of the necklace. The Windex will act as a lubricant, helping the knotted necklace strands slide past each other., Place your necklace in a small container on top of a vibrating object, such as a washing machine.Allow the necklace to rest on the vibrating object for a few minutes.


The vibrations will help shift and shake the knot of the necklace loose.
 After the necklace has had some time to sit and shake, remove the necklace from the small container, and rub the knot in between your fingers.At this point, the necklace should be loose enough to pick apart with your fingers.
 To remove the Windex residue, dip and rub your necklace in a cleaning solution consisting of a small amount of mild detergent and water.Rinse your necklace with clean water, and gently dry it with a paper towel.

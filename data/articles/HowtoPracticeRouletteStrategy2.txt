 The reverse martingale is increasing your bets when you win and decreasing your bets when you lose. The idea is that if you go on hot streaks, you'll increase your earnings, and if you hit a dry patch, you'll limit your losses.
 Again, the strategy is basically the same as the martingale, except reversed.
 For the sake of example, we'll assume you made a red or black bet.
 If you keep losing, continue betting your very small amount.
, This is the amount that you might bet if you won 14 straight bets:









1 - 2 - 4 - 8 - 16 - 32 - 64 - 128 - 256 - 512 - 1024 - 2048 - 4096 - 8192

, Using the reverse martingale can be risky if you lose. As soon as you lose, you've lost your entire earnings. To make the reverse martingale successful, then, you need to ride a streak of wins and quit before you lose.

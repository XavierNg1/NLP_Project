 If you are at a party or some social gathering, bring your two friends together so that they can physically meet each other. You can have one friend stay put while you track down the other one, or have one friend come with you while you look for the other one. Regardless, try to take them to place where you are able to introduce them.If one friend is being hesitant, say something like “I really want you to meet my friend Bob. He’s the biggest Wings fan I know” or “I’m going to introduce you to this person that I think you’ll like.”;
, Once you have brought your friends together, introduce them to each other. You can choose to do the introduction and say their names, or let them do the introducing. However, it may be less awkward and more formal if you do the introducing.Say something like “Bob, this is Barnaby Smith. Barnaby, this is Bob Robertson.”
Use someone’s full formal name when making an introduction, unless they prefer a nickname.
 Your friends will likely be curious about why you thought it necessary to introduce them to each other. You should explain your reason and let them know why you thought they would be friends. This is helpful because it gives them a point of commonality and an easy starting point for a conversation.Say something like “I thought I’d introduce you to each other because you are such big fans of the TV show Wings” or “you’re both new to town so I thought I’d introduce you to each other.”

, Once you do the initial introduction and explanation, stick around to keep the conversation going. Meeting new people can be awkward, so you should stay and keep the conversation from fizzling out. If it slows down, mention other things that your friends have in common.Unless your two friends really hit it off and strike up a good conversation, do not leave right away. Be sure to stick around and nurse the friendship that you are trying to create.

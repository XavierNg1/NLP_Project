 Is it inside the waste pipe outlet from the bathtub, the toilet, or perhaps in the kitchen sink? Obstructed waste pipes are likely to be the result of build-up of soap scum, hair, oil, or kitchen waste. The P-trap (sometimes called the U-bend trap) is the part of the pipe that needs to be disconnected and cleaned.
 P-traps (U-bend traps) are found beneath the plug hole of sinks and baths, and are found in the tank of toilets. This waste tube traps debris, prevents deep clogs from forming in your plumbing system, and to stops foul smelling gases and odors from passing into your home.Place a bucket or large bowl under your P-trap to catch the excess water when you unscrew the pipe.
To remove a P-trap, use a wrench to unscrew the pipeâ€™s retaining caps. Release the waste tube and pour out the water and debris. Then, flush out the P-trap with warm water to remove the remaining debris.
You can then use a wire or drain snake to push out any debris obstructing the actual pipe.
Replace the pipe and screw the caps back in place., Prevention is preferable to cure, so take care of your pipes to prevent them from clogging. If you make an effort to clean your drains every 1-2 weeks, they'll be less likely to form clogs.


Place strainers in all of your drains. These will stop debris (like hair, food, etc.) from entering your waste pipes.
Run a drain cleaner through your pipes every few weeks to prevent sludge from building up.
Run hot water through your garbage disposal after use to wash away excess debris.

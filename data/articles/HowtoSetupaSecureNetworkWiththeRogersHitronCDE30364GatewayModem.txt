 After the modem is set up we now need to access the router to change some settings. You need to go to your internet browser (Internet Explorer/Firefox/Chrome .etc) and open it up.;
, In the address bar you need to type in the default IP address. The IP address of this gateway modem is 192.168.0.1 and press enter.
 The default username is, "cusadmin" and password is, "password". Once you enter your credentials press Enter.
, First, wireless needs to be enabled. Wireless modem should be set to "11B/G/N Mixed" and channel set to auto.
 In the same tab where it says, "Primary SSID", that is where we are going to input the network name. It can really be anything you want.
 Now we need to set up some security for the network. There are 3 tabs along the top, the middle one is security, click that.
 There are 2 types of security for this router, WEP and WPA-Personal. We'll set it WPA-Personal. Now the other settings are set by default. The only other thing we need to do here is make a password. Pre-shared Key is where the password goes, make it anything you want. Just remember, the easier it is someone could possibly figure it out. Hit apply to set the password.
 This will make your network more secure. Back in the setup tab where we chose the name of the network there is a check box with "hidden" above it. Check the box and now your network is hidden from other people.
 To be able join it wirelessly you have to search for it in the Connection Manager. In the bottom right hand side of your monitor click on Connection Manager symbol (the one that has signal bars) and chose "Other Network"

, From there you need to type in the network name and password you chose from earlier.
 Now you're connected to your network and it is secure with a password.

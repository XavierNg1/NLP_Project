 There are a large number of different programs available to download. Some are free and some require a purchase. Generally, you will get better results from a purchased program. Many of the services that offer free conversion online have programs available for purchase as well, which can be useful if you have a lot of documents to convert.
 Once you have installed the program of your choice, you can begin converting your PDF files. Some programs will send the file to their server for conversion, while others will perform the conversion process on your own machine.


Some programs, such as Cometdocs, will allow you to right-click on the file you want to convert, and then select the format that you want to convert it to.
Many programs can convert to formats other than Excel as well.
 After youâ€™ve converted the PDF, open the resulting converted Excel file and check that all of data ended up in the right spot. You will most likely need to move a few things around, as no conversion program will work perfectly every time.

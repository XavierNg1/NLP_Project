 Get some thread, a bead and a needle. Slip one (or two) beads on the thread. Put the thread through the eye of the needle (like you would normally do in sewing) and knot it. Be careful not to drop the beads! Once you have the thread on the needle, take the needle and put it straight through your pet's ear. Snip off the thread near the needle, freeing the needle. Tie a secure knot and you have an earring! Repeat this step for another earring. You will have to cut the thread to remove these.

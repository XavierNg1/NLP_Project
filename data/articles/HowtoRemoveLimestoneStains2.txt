 Rub off stains immediately either with a damp cloth and gentle soap or brush off (if it's soot, dirt, etc.). Some stains can be removed using a bristle brush, especially when they're new. The sooner the item is attended to, the better. If not, proceed with deeper cleaning techniques., Every two weeks, you should dry mop your limestone floors. If you have limestone countertops, you should also clean them with a dust absorbent fabric every other week. There are plenty of cleaning supplies that specialize in efficient, dry cleaning.


You could use a dust mop on a table or countertop as long as the mop is clean.
 For areas around the house that get heavy foot traffic, use rugs, mats, or runners. Consider spots near doorways or hallways leading to a door. Most stains occur from dirt and mud tracked onto the floor.You should also have outdoor mats to wipe your feet off before entering your house.
 For the limestone table and countertop users, use coasters! Limestone is susceptible to ring stains and watermarks. Prevent any damage by having plenty of coasters available for you or your guests.


Place hot cooking supplies on protective mats. Similar to the condensation cups, the heat produced off hot plates can stain and damage your surfaces too.

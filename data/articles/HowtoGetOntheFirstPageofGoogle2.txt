 If you can make it work, fit your main keyword into your domain name as the first word in the domain. To boost rankings, you can also use a country TLD (top level domain, like .com) if you have a local business. You'll be rewarded for searches in your area, but doing this will hurt your searches outside of your country. Of course this doesn't matter if your business is local. At the very least, avoid replacing words with numbers (and other 90s tricks) and avoid using a subdomain.


This applies to subpages as well. Use descriptive and valid URLS for each page of the website. Give the pages names that tell search engines and users what they are instead of using generic names like "page1". Instead, do something like weddings, for your wedding rentals and catering page.
Keywords in subdomains also work in your favor. So for example, if you have a section of your site that is for wholesale, use an address like "weddings and wholesale".
 Your website code allows you to add invisible descriptions for pictures and pages. Use these, and try to fit at least one keyword into the text. Having one at all will help your rankings. If you don't know how to work your html code to do this, get your website designer to help you.
 Headers are another part of the website code where you can add text. Use these, and try to fit at least one keyword into the text. Having one at all will help your rankings. If you don't know how to work your html code to do this, get your website designer to help you.

 Your baby’s safety is paramount. Whether you’re using a hand-me-down or used crib, it’s important to make sure the crib is usable. Even seemingly minor things on a crib, such as a faulty latch, may harm your baby. Doing a preliminary search for any obvious problems can help you identify potential issues, recognize if you should keep the crib, and protect your baby from harm.Toss a crib that has visibly broken or defective parts. For example, broken slats, missing parts, or a defective bed spring can cause serious injury to your baby. In addition, toss a crib that that has bars more than 2 3/8 inches apart because they pose a strangulation risk.;
, In order to protect babies, governments issue guidelines for safe cribs. Recognize that hand-me-down and used cribs may not meet the latest safety standards. For example, traditional drop-sides increase the risk of suffocation or strangulation.You can find the latest safety guidelines and updates at https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/Multimedia/?vid=61784 and http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/products-cribs.html.


Check if there are any recalls for the crib. The US Consumer Protection Safety Commission has an online list of recalled cribs at https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls?field_rc_date_value%5Bmin%5D%5Bdate%5D=&field_rc_date_value%5Bmax%5D%5Bdate%5D=&combine=cribs.
 If you do not see any considerable safety hazards, fix any issues with the crib. Make sure to:Replace missing hardware
Tighten loose parts
See if you can get an immobilizer or stabilizer for a drop-side crib from the manufacturerPosition a drop-side crib so you don’t use it

, You may not be sure of the paint source for the crib. Lead paint is common in older cribs. In addition, a hand-me-down may not have non-toxic and/or baby safe paint. Remove any paint and then repaint or stain the crib with non-toxic, Zero VOC, no odor and baby safe paint.Clean any dirt or grime on the crib with a moistened towel. Allow it to dry completely. Sand the entire crib with medium (180#) or fine (220#) grit sandpaper. You can also use a sanding sponge. Remove any sanding dust.
Apply at least two coats of your paint. Wait 4 hours between coats. Add a clear finish topcoat if you like. Allow the paint to dry thoroughly in a well-ventilated area before your baby occupies it.
 Your baby will spend a lot of time in their crib. Old mattresses can harbor allergens, have defects, and/or may not meet current safety guidelines. Replacing any mattress with a brand new one can ensure that your baby gets enough rest and stays safe.Buy the best quality mattress you can afford. Choose from a foam or innerspring mattress that is firm. A firm mattress will have little to no indentation when you press into it. A soft mattress can increase the risk for suffocation or SIDS if it conforms to your baby’s head.
Make sure the mattress fits snugly into each corner of the crib. There shouldn’t be any gaps between the sides of the crib and the mattress. You can check this by seeing how many fingers fit in the gap. If it is more than 2, the gap is too large., Your baby only needs a sheet on the mattress to sleep. Items such as blankets, bumpers, and pillows can strangle or suffocate a baby. You should also keep toys, including stuffed animals, out of the crib. Hang any mobiles high enough above the crib that your baby can’t reach it. Remove any mobiles if your baby can push up on their hands and knees.

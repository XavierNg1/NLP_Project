 Maybe you have some friends on this server or maybe you want to find a bunch of strangers to help, your call. All you need to do is get an minimum two friends/strangers to be your trainers. If you want, you could also be a trainer, again, it's your call.
 This isn't necessary but it is handy as this person will be the one who organises the 'business deals' and keeps a record of them. It is probably best to make it someone who is very well organised or just online the most.

'Keeping a record' issue. Everything runs a whole lot smoother if you keep a book and quill handy. In this you can write the player name, what Pok√©mon you trained for them, and how many levels you trained them to. This will help you keep on top of your deals and make sure that someone hasn't forgotten to pay you.

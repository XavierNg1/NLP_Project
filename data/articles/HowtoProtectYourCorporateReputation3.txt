 Act quickly to remove dangerous and/or offensive products from the market. Things sometimes slip through the cracks, or the bad judgment of a single manager can lead to a sullied reputation. Limit the impact of these mishaps by acknowledging that a mistake has been made, and commit to remedying the issue.
 Your dealings with other companies often help shape your corporate reputation. Acknowledging the contributions of other companies, paying invoices on time, and communicating honestly and respectfully are ways to ensure that the reputation of your business stays positive.

 If you want to maintain a post or picture's Likes and comments when you repost it, you'll need to comment on it. You can comment on someone's post or picture.


You can also use this method to repost an old post made by you or a friend. Find the original post (you may have to go back through their Timeline) and then read on.
This isn't exactly "reposting", but it is the only way to bump a post to the top of people's feeds without losing the Likes and comments. If you use the "Share" feature on a post, it will make a new post and remove the likes and comments.;
, This will send it to the top of your feed, which will show up on your friends' feeds. You can do this for old posts that you want to bring back to the top, or with posts that your friends might not normally see.


You can also Like the old post, but this is less likely to send it back to the top.
 This will make a new post with the same content on your own feed. It won't keep the original comments and Likes, but you will control the post.

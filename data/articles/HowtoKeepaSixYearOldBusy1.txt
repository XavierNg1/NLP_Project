You can repeat this game over and over, changing it up every time., This game will get your six-year-old moving and keep them occupied. The more clues they have, the longer the game will last, so take a little time to write down words or phrases for them to act out.Make sure the phrases you use are not too difficult for your child to understand or act out.
The player draws a phrase at random and reads it to himself.
Before starting to act out the phrase, they can indicate how many words it involves by showing that number of fingers to the people who will be guessing the phrase, then the player can hold up one finger to act out the first word, or two fingers to act out the second word, and so on.
The group can also agree on gestures which would indicate if the phrase is the title of a book, movie, song, etcâ€¦
The player must act out the phrase physically, without using any words, until the guessers figure out the phrase.

 Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of cooking oil to a medium skillet or wok. Set the pan on your stove over medium-high heat.


Olive oil works well, but you can use other cooking oils, as well. Consider using vegetable oil, canola oil, or sunflower oil.
 Add the baby corn to the hot oil. Cook, stirring continuously, until the corn becomes tender and light golden brown on all sides.


When bitten or pierced with a fork, the baby corn should feel tender but should still retain some “bite” or crispness.
 Drain the oil and serve the baby corn while it's still hot.


The cooking oil should added flavor to the corn, so you probably won't need to add any butter. You could, however, serve the corn with a sprinkle of fresh herbs or a dash of pepper.
Save leftovers in an airtight container and store them in your refrigerator for up to one or two days.

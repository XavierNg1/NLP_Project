 Some people may prefer using their own bodyweight as the main resistance while building muscle since bodyweight workouts are easier to do at home and don’t require gym equipment. Dead hangs are simply holding onto something above you and supporting your bodyweight with your grip alone. Since the tension is on your grip, you squeeze harder the longer you hang and work forearm muscles.The larger the surface you choose to grip, the harder you will have to squeeze, so something wider than a typical chin-up bar will work your forearms harder., For a harder, advanced workout, you can do a dead hang of several seconds at the bottom of every chin-up. The pause will ensure that you’re not using any body swing or inertia to start the next chin-up as well.
 You can do this exercise either leaning against a bar or a table, or you can do it on the ground in a push-up position (which will be harder). Lean your weight against the surface, and use your wrists and fingers to push your weight back off the surface.In a push-up position, for instance, you will not bend at the elbows to lower yourself; instead, keep your elbows straight and use your wrists and fingers to push off the ground and lift yourself even higher.You can add this extra movement onto each normal push-up to get more out of every repetition as well.

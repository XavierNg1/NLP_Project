 A 2014 Gallup-Purdue Index Report from interviews with 30,000 U.S. graduates found that “where graduates went to college ... hardly matters at all to their current well-being and their work lives in comparison to their experiences in college.” A key is to focus on having a good experience, not on getting into the “right” school. Some good experiences include involvement in extracurricular activities and/or having an internship. Ultimately, it's not where you went to school but what you did while there that will have a stronger impact on quality of work after graduation., College can be an important part of that process. However, if it doesn’t go the way you planned, there are many ways to get the education and experience you need. You can obtain an education through mentorships, apprenticeships, internships, and studying abroad. Attending another school affords most of the same benefits as your dream college. While there, you'll still make some great friendships, have the opportunity to get involved in activities for both fun and professional reasons, create memorable experiences, and get a quality education., Don't expect this expedition to be clear-cut and predictable. For most people, going from high school to desired college to internship to fantastic job is more of a dream than a reality. Actually, it's become more common to change majors more than once in a college that wasn't a first choice.

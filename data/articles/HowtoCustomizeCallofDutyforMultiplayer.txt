, This applies to all game modes with some sort of objective.
Grenades and special/tactical grenades help really well against dug in enemies ('campers').
Check the radar once in a while. It shows enemy movement, but it isn't completely up to date so try not to rely on it.
Snipers often put Claymores by the entrances to where they are so be careful.
When an enemy is at very close range, you probably won't get a chance to ADS (Aim Down Sights) so fire off the hip, try not to use a whole clip though otherwise you may run out of ammo whilst on a streak or when in need of it.
Double-tap and stopping power both multiply their respective attribute by 1.4. This means that a gun shooting an already powerful round, will benefit more from double tap, and that a fast gun benefits more from stopping power.
When 'camping' in a building, use the element of surprise to your benefit. Don't stay in the same spot.
Dodging enemy sniper fire is done easily by sprinting, jumping, ducking then sprinting further. Do it when you're about 75% of the total path. It helps not getting shot in the chest, which would result in your death.
Unless an enemy is at close range, shoot in bursts (3-4 bullets).
Know what you're doing. The better the players, the more a game gets chess-like properties. That means you have to plan moves ahead, and keep their possible moves in mind. (Example: You're lying prone 'camping' by a doorway. Somebody can easily throw in a grenade and kill you before you get away.)
Try keeping your Kill Death Ratio above 1, it will help you finding a productive playstyle, keeping balance between playing defensive and offensive.
 Some people like the fast fragging action on free-for-all or team death match.
Each game type offers a unique way to approach the game. Some are better for sniping while others are better for assault rifles and sub machine guns.

 If you're not "on-the-ground" so to speak, be aware that you're not the frontline but that you do serve as a source of collaborative support. If the cause or protest you're actively promoting is one that involves violence, mayhem, and injury to people, such as during a political clash on the streets involving armies or police, and you're simply relaying the happenings, then you're certainly not experiencing the same hardships that those people on the ground are. Nevertheless, your moral support, your clear and continued collaboration to spread an outcry against the wrongs being committed against your fellow global citizens is a source of strength and solidarity with those who are at the frontline. Provided you remember your supportive and collaborative role in using social media, you'll be able to maintain the level of respect and concern for the dignity of people experiencing incredible hardships without coming across as cloying, condescending, or poorly informed.


See yourself as helping to empower others.
Be ready to apologize if you do cross the line and become over-zealous or misunderstand the issues. It can happen in the heat of the moment, in the power of the passion and given the nature of being fast online. Don't be arrogant â€“ admit you overstepped the mark and get on with being a supporter or promoter again.
Don't retweet or share updates that you don't understand or fully engage with. Take the time to read everything relevant through thoroughly and ensure that it makes sense with you and aligns with your reasons for supporting the cause. In other words, don't just assume that things you've been copied in on are valid or worthy of redistribution without analyzing them first.

 Expect slow cookers to be made from a range of materials. Be aware that not all cleaning methods are suitable for each type. Always read your owner’s manual before cleaning and check if it advises against certain cleaners or materials., First, unplug the cooker to avoid electrical shock or fire. Moisten a cloth in warm water and wring it out. Scrub the exterior and wipe dry. If water alone doesn’t work, add a few drops of mild dish detergent to warm water and try again.


Stronger cleaners are generally advised against since they may ruin the exterior’s finish and/or damage parts.
Adding baking soda to the water/soap mixture will help get rid of any particularly stubborn bits or stains.
 If any spills have dribbled down into the handles and/or knobs, detach them as directed in your owner’s manual. Wash each with warm water (or warm water with mild dish detergent). Dry thoroughly before reattaching.Don’t forget to inspect their connection points before reattaching. If food has spilled into them, clean the connection points with your dampened cloth if it’s safe to do so. Otherwise, use a toothpick or dry brush to pick or scrape off foods.
 If food has run all the way down the cooker’s sides, look underneath. Usually the electrical parts are housed here, so only clean with a damp cloth if the area in question is solid, with no direct access to internal parts. For any areas with slits or holes, use a dry brush or toothpick to remove crud from them., Remove the stoneware insert from the cooker. Wash in the sink with a sponge, warm water, and mild dish detergent. Or feel free to stick it in the dishwasher for its next cycle if the owner’s manual states that it’s safe to do so., Once the insert is removed, inspect the cooker’s interior casing in case any food seeped in during spills. If so, moisten and wring out a clean cloth with plain warm water and scrub the interior. Dry immediately to prevent rust and other damage to internal parts.

 A purple color-correcting shampoo will counteract the yellow tones and make your hair appear brighter and blonder. This is not as strong as toner, since it is intended for regular use. Here are a few examples of purple or violet shampoos:


Tressa Watercolors Violet Washe Shampoo
John Frieda Sheer Blonde Color Renew Tone-Correcting
Clairol Shimmer Lights
Pravana Pure Light Brightening Shampoo for Blonde, Silver, or Highlighted Hair
Any shampoo with "D&C Violet" or "Extract Violet" in the ingredients list

, Apply the purple shampoo instead of normal shampoo, then rinse out and follow it with conditioner.
 Too much purple shampoo will leave your hair with a light purple reflection. Apply every two or three washes, or even less often once the brassy tones have gone.

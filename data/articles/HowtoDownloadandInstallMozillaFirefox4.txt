 You can get the Firefox app from the Google Play Store or from the Mozilla website.
 Tap the install button to install the Firefox application. The installer will ask you to accept permissions. These do things like let Firefox access your GPS location, or write files to your SD card. Review and accept the permissions to continue.
 Once installation is complete, you can open the app. Check the box to “Allow automatic updating”. This will ensure that your Firefox app has the latest security fixes.

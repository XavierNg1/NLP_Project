 Many sites that allow comments on articles or other forms of community interaction allow you to sign in with your Twitter account. This can save you time and keep the number of different profiles you have online to a minimum.


Make sure the site you are signing into is a trustworthy site. By connecting your Twitter account, you could potentially be revealing personal information and connections.
 The functionality will vary from site to site, but generally there will be a button with the Twitter logo that you can use to log in with your Twitter account.


This will only be available for sites that allow it. While there are lots of sites with Twitter connectivity, there are plenty of sites that require you to create an account with them.
 When you choose to log in with Twitter, a new window will appear. This window comes from Twitter, and displays what information the site will be able to access from your profile. Be sure to review this information before entering your login details.
 Once you've logged in with your Twitter account, you can begin posting and interacting with the site. Generally, your username on the site will be the same as your Twitter username, though some sites allow you to change it later.

 Don't stay there longer than you need to.;
, You are going to need a bow with several arrows, and the best sword you can get. If you can enchant the sword and/or bow, that would be the best option.
 Store items like diamonds, emeralds, and ender pearls. Also, be sure to bring flint and steel in case you need to relight the portal, and a lot of cobblestone. A map may come in useful; it will not tell which direction you are facing, but it will show you where you are. It will be useful if you get lost. Snowballs are useful for fighting blazes; you can bring them in the form of snow blocks to save space, and use a shovel to convert them back to snowballs.
 Be sure to bring food you can eat quickly, such as cooked meat instead of something like cake. If you can afford it, golden apples would be even more preferable as they give you regeneration and resistance. "Enchanted" golden apples with purple sheen will give you fire resistance as well, but are no longer craftable in PC edition, so may be best saved for fighting blazes.
 Ghast fireballs won't destroy cobblestone, so be sure to bring a lot of it to the nether. Fireballs won't destroy obsidian, but they could "unlight" the portal, leaving you stranded (unless you have flint and steel).

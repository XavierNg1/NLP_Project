 Though whole eggs contain a bit more protein than egg whites, their relative value comes from nutrients and vitamins that are plentiful in the egg yolk. For instance, even a small raw egg contains meaningful amounts of iron, phosphorus, zinc, and folate. Further, yolks also contain good vitamins A and D, as well as a bunch of choline, lutein, and zeaxanthin, all of which your body needs., One small whole egg contains 54 calories and 47% of your daily allotment of cholesterol, while the equivalent amount of egg whites contains only 17 calories and 0 cholesterol. If you’re counting calories or watching your cholesterol intake, egg whites may be the better option. Otherwise, whole eggs may be the better option, as they contain many healthy vitamins and nutrients.For egg whites, there is variation in flavor and consistency between different brands. If you don’t like the first type of egg whites you try, switch brands and try another - some cook more easily than others too.
Follow the container for the equivalent amount of egg white to use in exchange for whole eggs. Usually, two of the “equivalent” amount will cook up to about as much as one whole egg, in terms of size.
You can also make your own egg whites by removing the yolks from eggs yourself. There are several easy ways to do so at home.
 The best place to get eggs is a local farmer’s market. Not only will they be fresh and flavorful, they often come from healthier hens. At the grocery store, opt for cage-free, organic eggs or egg whites. These will ensure that the hens were not fed unhealthy food that may translate into health risks for you., A solid compromise is to use egg whites along with a whole egg. For a personal omelet, use one whole egg and two egg whites. (This is the rough equivalent of four egg whites or two whole eggs.) This effectively maximizes the protein to calorie ratio of your omelet.

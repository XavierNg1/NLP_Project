 Make sure that the rack is in the upper third of the oven.Broiling is different from regular baking in that the heat comes from the top of the oven. Your s'mores will also be ready much faster., Place half of the broken graham crackers on a baking sheet, leaving a few inches/centimeters of space between each one. Set the rest aside for later. How many crackers you break depends on how many s'mores you want to eat. One graham cracker is enough to make one s'more.
 Make sure that you set them flat-side-down so that they don't roll off.
 Keep the oven door cracked open and watch the marshmallows closely; things brown quickly in a broiler! They are ready when the marshmallows turn golden-brown., The best type of chocolate to use for s'mores are the type that you can break into smaller squares. You should be able to fit 2 to 4 squares on each s'more.
 Press down gently on the s'more to help seal everything together.
 This gives the chocolate enough time to soften up and turn gooey.It will also allow the marshmallows to cool down a little.

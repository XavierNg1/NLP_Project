 DEET (N, N-diethyl-meta-tolumide) is the most effective chemical ingredient for repelling bugs.Apply bug repellent containing DEET to all exposed areas of skin before going outside. Be sure to reapply the repellent according to the product’s label’s instructions. Make sure not to use DEET-based repellents when wearing sunglasses or plastic eyeglass lenses, as the chemical can dissolve plastics and some synthetic materials.A few studies have suggested there can be adverse side effects to DEET. DEET-containing repellents have however been approved by the EPA and the Center for Disease Control as safe for long-term human use when used according to the label instructions.;
, Picaridin is a synthetic compound derived from plant extract. It is man-made like DEET, but a compound rather than a chemical. Picaridin has not been as widely tested as DEET, but current studies show it to be just as effective, and it is not harmful to any materials. Many of the major bug repellent producers, such as Cutter, carry repellents based on Picaridin., Permethrin is both a repellent and insecticide, meaning that is has the ability to kill bugs on contact as well as repel them by scent. It is recommended by the EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) for use on clothing, shoes, bed nets, and camping gear.Spray only on fabrics, and do not spray on clothing while you're wearing it. Use only repellents and permethrin-based products that have specific instructions for treating clothing.After a item has been sprayed with a product containing permethrin, the fabric will repel insects through several washings.

 Look at it as one of the many things that you will experience during your pregnancy and labor that you may not get to experience again. Writing your birth plan should not be just another chore that you have to complete.


Get your family or your partner involved. Bounce ideas off of your family or partner and let them join in the experience with you. Take their suggestions, but in the end, remember that the experience you have should be the one that you choose, not anybody else.
 You don’t want to forget your birth plan at home because doing so can cause added stress for you. You don’t want to have to verbally explain everything that you took the time to write down. You want to have it in front of your caregiver so that you do not experience any additional stress trying to remember all of the details that are so important to you.

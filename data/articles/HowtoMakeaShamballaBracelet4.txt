 Cut a length of cord 50cm/19 inches long.
 The two middle cords now become the centre cord and the new piece of cord turns into the left and right cords.
 Keep this fairly loose because it needs to slide when adjusting the bracelet length.
 Tie off the last knot as explained in the "Tying off the bracelet" section above. Don't glue the two middle cords though, as these are what will form the sliding mechanism.









Cut off the ends and leave one cord each side of the square knots.










Tie a knot toward the end of the first cord, leaving enough space for the bead and a final knot.
Slide the bead into place next to the knot. Tie the bead in.
Leave the last bit of cord dangling beneath the bead. Only cut down if it's a little too long.
 Once you've mastered the first one, it will be easier to make more and these make ideal gifts and market stall items.

 The scissors or craft knife must be sturdy, strong and sharp.


Scissors tend to be the easiest to control.
Match the scissor blade length to the size of the circle being cut (smaller circles, small scissors; larger circles, full size scissors). Using scissors that are too small or large will make the job of cutting a lot harder.;
, Use a craft cutting (self-healing) mat or similar surface that can handle cutting. In other words, don't do this on an heirloom piece of furniture!


Also ensure that the work surface is not slippery.

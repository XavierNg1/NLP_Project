 Try to go to group activities where you can be around people who share your interests. Shared interests give you an automatic connection to the other people you are around.You will not have to worry so much about what to talk about.


Also accept invites from friends to go different places whether you are excited about the event or not.Once you are there, you may find that you are actually having a good time.
Group activities you can try include school clubs, sports teams, or volunteer activities in your community.
 It could be tempting to show up late to an event so that you can just blend in to the crowd. However, this will actually work against you. Arrive early to give yourself time to adjust to the surroundings and get more comfortable. If you know the person who is hosting the event, ask if they need any help setting up. You will feel more comfortable because you have something to do.By the time the crowd comes in, you will already feel comfortable.
For example, if the party starts at 7:00 pm, get there at 6:45 pm.
 You may get overwhelmed or drained when you are socializing with others. This is completely normal. If possible, set a time limit for how long you will stay. Maybe you plan to go to the party for an hour and interact with people.If you are not able to leave, try to get 10-15 minutes of alone time in a bathroom or a quiet area.
You will feel refreshed after being by yourself.

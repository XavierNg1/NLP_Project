 A lot of food in your child's plate may overwhelm them, which could lead to food throwing. Instead of piling food on your child's bowl or plate, regulate the amount of food you are serving out each time, and add more once they clear their plate., If the child is not listening to you and continually throws food or drops their plate on the floor, end the meal. Once the toddler understands the consequences of their actions, they may stop throwing food.If you are worried that your toddler didn't get enough to eat, you can give them a healthy snack later.
 When your child starts to throw food, it's important to make them aware of the rules even if they don't fully understand what you are saying. Tell your child not to do it and ask them if they are still hungry before ending the meal.Say things like "Are you done?" or "Not hungry anymore?" when your child starts throwing food.
 Give your toddler positive feedback when there is a successful meal that's free of food-throwing. Don't give too much attention or negative reinforcement when they throw food, or else they could perceive the attention as a reward.You can say "Great job Henry! You had a great meal and you didn't throw any of your food."
Affordable rewards like stickers or fruit snacks are also great tangible rewards for your toddler.

 Typically, a wedding will have a particular colour scheme, for example, blush and gold. You may want to match your wedding program to the overall style and colour scheme of your wedding.
 If you find the program is slightly dull with just words, you could add a photo of the bride and groom on the front cover or some sort of special design that matches the theme of your wedding.For example, you may have a country/western themed wedding and a pair of cowboy boots would be a cute addition to the program.
 There are a lot of amazing and creative ideas that can help you come up with a unique wedding program design that matches the theme of your wedding. If you are having a modern formal wedding, try a Google image search for "formal modern wedding programs." You can also look on Pinterest for creative ideas.For example, make your program into a fan. If you are having an outdoor wedding during the summer, it is likely going to be fairly warm. One creative way to help your guests beat the heat is by placing your wedding program on a wooden stick so that it can be used as a fan.



Punch two holes in the top left corner. The holes should be about 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) from the edge of the paper. You can place the holes either beside or on top of one another.
Run a thin piece of ribbon up through each hole and tie a small bow on the front.
 Use the same shade of ribbon that was used on the programs to tie a bow onto the basket. Place the basket on the guest registry table.


Alternatively, you could have the groomsmen hand out the programs as guests enter the wedding ceremony venue.

 White pants tend to swallow small frames; if you’re petite, avoid baggy fits and choose a slim-fit or skinny pair. These will show off your fit physique, rather than obscure it.With slim-fit and skinny styles, definitely make sure you choose a thicker fabric. The closer fit raises the risk of things showing through., If you have curves, slim-fit and skinny styles tend to emphasize problem areas. Balance out your curves by choosing a pair with a boot cut or flare legs.Go for a fabric that has some stretch to it, which will further disguise any imperfections.Look for small pockets and detailed stitching, as well. Both features can help create a more proportionate look.
 White pants can be tricky, since the color tends to emphasize flaws and makes everything appear larger (as opposed to black, which is known for its slimming effect). To combat this, choose one size up from your usual fit. Crinkles and imperfections will be concealed better, and your curves won’t look crammed into too-tight white pants.

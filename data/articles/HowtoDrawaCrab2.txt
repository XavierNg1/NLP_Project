 Draw a baseball diamond shape for the shell of the crab. Add the legs by drawing eight lines toward the bottom middle of the baseball diamond and two claw lines toward the top.
 Crab shells are rough and pointy around all of their edges. Take your pencil and add ridge detail to the shell of the crab.
 Make sure the claws look strong. The claw itself is made up of different shapes.You can create the pincers with crescent shapes on the inside.


You can also create your claw by starting with a rectangle shape on the edge of the diamond. Add a small circle onto the top of the rectangle and then two crescent shapes facing each other for the pincers.
Once this is done, start drawing out the shapes of the walking legs, and the very back swimming legs.
 Give the legs and claws the same treatment you gave the body. Make the edges look rough and sharp by adding small bumps and points.


Give the crab some small eyes on the tip of its head and two short antenna. Erase all the guidelines and shapes that you drew in step one.

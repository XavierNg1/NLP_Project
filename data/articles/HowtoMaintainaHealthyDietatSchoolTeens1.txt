 Go for yogurt with fresh fruit like strawberries or blueberries and granola, or a bowl of wholegrain breakfast cereal that is low in sugar with low-fat milk. Starting the morning off with a meal also signals the metabolism to rev-up, creating a calorie-burning, fat-burning environment for the rest of the day. Remember that what you eat at breakfast will impact your cravings for the rest of the day. Choose proteins, whole grains and healthy fats.


You can also have eggs and multigrain toast or a breakfast smoothie with a frozen banana, berries, water or coconut milk, and honey.;
, Sugary soft drinks and sodas will only lead to a temporary sugar high and a poor diet. Substitute sodas and fruit juices with a water bottle full of filtered water. Add a slice of lemon, lime, cucumber, or orange for all natural flavor. Put the full water bottle in your school bag so you have it ready when you’re thirsty at school., Wrap an apple and a banana in a paper bag and put it in your backpack in the morning, or put a few sugar free granola bars in your bag. This way, when you’re hungry between periods you have healthy snacks rather than processed snacks from the vending machine.Focus on foods that do not need to be kept cool. Sometimes a cold pack can be used, but to eliminate the chance of food-borne illness, choose foods that are shelf-stable and can easily be carried around throughout the day.
You can also prepare healthy snacks the night before by cutting up fresh fruit and packing it in tupperware, or putting trail mix in ziploc bags. Stash them by the front door so you can grab them in the morning or pack them in your school bag.

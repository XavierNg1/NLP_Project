 Beca is easygoing, and she doesn't appear to worry about a lot of things. She is very relaxed, and you're going to want to achieve that laid back feeling if you want her personality.;
, Music is Beca's best friend and - from now on - music is your best friend too! Always have an electronic device that can blast your favorite music on there whenever you want to listen. When you do listen, fall into a trance of you and yourself! Attempt to appear transfixed, and you'll gradually get the hang of it so well that you won't even have to think about it, but make sure you don't appear too transfixed or people will know that you're faking it.
 Although not everyone is as talented as Beca, you don't have to possess the ability to charm listeners with your angelic voice in order to be able to sing. This step isn't mandatory, but at least sing to yourself. Whether butterflies and rainbows appear or flowers wilt and the animals scatter when you open your mouth to sing, don't let anything stop you from singing because perfect isn't necessary. It's just an extra bonus.
 While this step might sound strange, don't be too interested in making new friends. If you already have a group of friends, limit yourself to them and them only. Anyone else goes out of your mind.

 One day, should you become injured or sick enough, you may need to face a disability. It is a drastic life changer.
 Do you have money put away in an account? Do you have a place to live safely, with no threat of losing your home? Can you count on your parents/friends/other family members? Have that discussion now.
 It may be hard to do.
 You may need to seek paid legal help. Lawyers can pick which cases they will take. The good ones work on a percentage, but others may want a lot upfront to help you.
 Filling for disability on your own is not easy, but you can do it. (It is a necessity if you don't have any income.) You will need to visit all of your main doctors and have them fill out a report. Getting copies of your medical records may cost you a fee and it will take time. Find out if there is a best time of month to submit the completed paperwork.


A decision about your disability can take 3-12 months or more. Enclose a well written letter explaining your health issues and how you had worked as long as possible. Your application will be evaluated by "their" doctor(s). The doctor will ask you several questions and it will only take about fifteen minutes. Then you wait to hear something.

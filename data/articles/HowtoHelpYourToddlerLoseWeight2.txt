 Don’t put your toddler on a treadmill, but encourage your child to play actively for over an hour every single day.


Have your toddler play soccer, swim with you, dance to music at home, chase his or her siblings (or you), or run around with other children at the playground.
 If your toddler is hesitant to engage in physical activity, show him or her how much fun it can be by participating in games and exercise with your toddler.


Participating in physical activities is also good for your health, and it makes it clear to your child that exercise is not a punishment.
 Ask whether the pre-school or daycare center where your child spends the bulk of his or her time incorporates significant sessions of physical activity into the daily routine.


All childcare centers should build in at least one hour of high-energy physical play into each day’s schedule.

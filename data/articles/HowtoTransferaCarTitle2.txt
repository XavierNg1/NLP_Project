 Most states require a bill of sale, which is a brief document that spells out the details of the sale or transfer. In your bill of sale, you will need to include the following information:


Purchase price
VIN
Make and model of the car
Odometer reading, and statement verifying its authenticity
Signatures of both buyer and seller. If the title has more than one name as the original owner, you will probably need both of them to sign the bill of sale., The title certificate itself will contain spaces, usually on the back, for you to complete with the details of the transfer. Be sure to read the instructions very carefully. In some states, you may actually have to take the title to the Registry of Motor Vehicles, with both the buyer and seller in person, in order to complete this step., If the original title listed one or more lienholders, you will either need to pay off that loan before making the transfer, or you will need to get a certificate signed by the lienholder assenting to the transfer., In most states, the buyer is responsible for requesting a new title and registration for the car. There is usually a brief time limit, approximately 30 days, to complete this. The buyer should check with the Registry of Motor Vehicles in his or her state for the exact procedure.

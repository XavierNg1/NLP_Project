 If the bars are too high or too far apart, this can be dangerous.;
, This is a must-do. At least one kid will fall off.
 For instance, have one station involve doing a front support. Another could be pullovers with help, and a third could be casting drills.
 Showing is better than telling. Bring up a kid to help demonstrate.


Switch the stations so that each kid gets a turn at each one. Have each kid go one at a time and show the kids the skill that they will practice.
 This is the station where the kids can play, swing, or do any skill.
 This is on the low bar (with a mat under, if necessary). The kids do a pullover, either with help or by themselves.
, This is not a station, but a course. The kids can swing over the lava, water, etc., jump on the springboard, then (with the stairs) swing off the high bar onto a wrestling mat (8-inch mat).
 This means that the kids will put both their hands and feet on the bar, and swing off with the help of a coach staying in that position until they land.
 This is leaning forwards while staying tucked and going down off the bar.
 For example, they could do 5 sit ups, then get to practice their splits, or something else fun

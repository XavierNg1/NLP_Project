 There are three primary doshas in Ayurveda: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. You can review the qualities of each dosha to determine your dosha or take an online Dosha quiz to determine your dosha: http://doshaquiz.chopra.com/. If you have addictive eating behaviors or an eating disorder, you may have an underlying Vata imbalance as part of your mind-body type.Though some people may use Ayurvedic as a tactic to lose weight, it is not designed as a weight loss program. Rather, Ayurvedic focuses on ensuring you have a mind-body balance through your diet and your eating habits to have a more healthy lifestyle and way of thinking.;
, If your primary dosha is Vata, you are very focused on movement and change and possess an energetic and creative mind. Your require balance and stability in your life and low stress to feel energized and enthusiastic about life. But you are also prone to anxiety and insomnia.Vatas tend to have irregular eating patterns, especially when feeling stressed or overworked. You may also be guided by food cravings for comfort foods like chocolate, baked goods, or pastas, rather than a consistent and healthy meal schedule, and you may be prone to skipping meals. You can have extreme eating habits that involve lots of snacking and stress eating or missing meals entirely. Your eating is often centered around stress and you may use eating as a way to deal with feelings of anxiety and imbalance.
 A Pitta dosha tends to be full of intensity for food, experiences, and knowledge. Pittas enjoy being challenged and using their intellect to learn new things. When you feel imbalanced or stressed, you tend to develop heat related issues in your body like heartburn, ulcers, hypertension, and inflammatory conditions. This heat can also manifest in your personality, as you may be prone to frustration, irritability, and feelings of anger.Pittas crave order and predictability with their eating habits and diet, with structured meal times three times a day at the same time every day. You focus on stability and control in many aspects of your life, including eating, and may feel annoyed or grouchy if your meal schedule is thrown off or you eat later than usual. Pittas tend to overeat as a way to express anger, literally swallowing their anger, through eating too much at every meal. You may also view overeating as a way to rebel against stressful situations or larger issues in the world.
 This mind-body type tends to have a natural propensity for physical strength and endurance. You may be naturally athletic, with a calm personality and the ability to use critical thinking and retain information quickly. However, you may be prone to weight gain, fluid retention, and allergies if you are feeling imbalanced. You may also exhibit an aversion to change and an overall stubborn demeanor. Kaphas tend to hold on to experiences, relationships, and objects long after they stop being useful or necessary.Kaphas usually have a natural love of eating and can become addicted to food. If you are feeling imbalanced, you may eat constantly, before and after meal times. You may use food to hide your intense emotions and as a way to avoid confrontation with others or with your own feelings and emotions.
 The Ayurvedic diet focuses on creating meals around the six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent. The idea is to include all six tastes in every meal so every major food group is present on your plate and you are consuming enough nutrients. Foods that contain each of the six tastes include:Sweet: These include foods such as whole grains, dairy, meat, chicken, fish, honey, sugar, and molasses.
Sour: These include foods such as cheese, yogurt, alcohol, vinegar, pickled foods, tomatoes, plums, berries, and citrus fruits.
Salty: These include foods such as seaweed, salted meats, fish, soy sauce, and any food that contains added salt.
Bitter: These include foods such as green vegetables (leafy greens, celery, broccoli, sprouts, spinach, kale), endives, chicory, beets, and tonic water.
Pungent: These include foods such as onions, garlic, chilies, peppers, cayenne, black pepper, cloves, ginger, mustard, and salsa.
Astringent: These include foods such as dried beans, lentils, green apples, cauliflower, figs, pomegranates, and tea.

 As part of the Ayurvedic diet, you can use breathing awareness meditation to distract yourself from an emotionally based craving for unhealthy foods or to prevent food binging. Practice meditation whenever you feel a craving coming on.Sit in a quiet area with your hands by your sides and close your eyes. Breathe deeply, focusing on your breathing as it flows from your lungs out through your nose. Inhale and exhale with awareness.
Let your attention follow your breathe as it moves from your lungs and out your nose. Keep your eyes closed and continue to focus on your breath, pushing out all outside thoughts. Do this for five to ten minutes.
 Your body will send messages to your brain to indicate when it is hungry and requires food. Focusing on your bodyâ€™s natural need for food, rather than your emotional desire for food, will ensure you are eating enough every day. Only eat when you are hungry and stop eating when you are satisfied. However, when you are feeling really hungry, eat until you are comfortable full but not stuffed or overly full. This will allow your digestive system to process the food and not be overwhelmed by food.Allow your stomach, rather than your emotions, to dictate how much you eat every day and when you eat. Try to do this for two weeks in a row, eating when you feel hungry, which may mean you eat at unusual times or do not eat for a period of time until you feel hunger. Then, only eat until you feel comfortably full. This will allow you to be more in touch with your bodyâ€™s natural eating cycle and avoid overeating or eating with your emotions.

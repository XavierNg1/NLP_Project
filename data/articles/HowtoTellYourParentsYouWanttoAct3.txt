 Let your parents know how seriously you take your choice by studying the subject. The main way you will convince your parents is to show them that you are passionate and realistic about your ambition. Some ideas include:


Learn how to act by taking acting lessons.
Join the thespians.

Try out for a school play.
Read plays and talk about them.
Go to plays, not movies.

Audition. If you already have a part in a semi-professional or professional production when you tell your parents that's great, but if they hear that you have simply auditioned and gone through the rejection process they will feel better about your understanding of this career.

 After removing your new sheets from their packaging, place them directly into the washing machine.


If they are queen size or larger, you may want to wash the top and bottom sheets separately to give them enough room in the machine.;
, Instead of your normal laundry detergent, add one cup of baking soda to the machine.


It's important to omit the detergent, as it tends to lock chemicals into the sheets. These chemicals contribute to the stiffness of the sheets, so it's better to remove them.
 Set the machine to a regular cycle using warm water, and turn the washer on.
 When it's time for the rinse cycle, turn the temperature of the machine to cold and add a cup of white vinegar.


This will help to soften the sheets further, but is completely optional. The baking soda will work on its own., When the rinse cycle is finished, remove the sheets from the machine and hang outside to dry in the sun.


This will help to soften them further. If you don't have space to dry them outside, place in the dryer and dry on a low setting - drying at too high a temperature can cause shrinkage., Once the sheets are dry, you can wash them a second time using the regular amount of detergent.


Although washing them twice sounds like a lot of work, it really helps to soften the sheets.
Dry outside or in the dryer, then iron them (if you like) and place them directly on the bed.
 Good quality sheets will become softer after every washing, drying and ironing cycle.


For ultimate softness (and durability) buy good quality cotton sheets with a high thread count.

 If there’s something happening in your area and you can’t go anywhere to ensure your safety, monitor the news to stay aware. Both natural disasters and conflict can develop rapidly, and being aware will increase your safety.


Hearing that a storm has passed or that a civil scenario has been resolved can reassure you that you’re safe for the night too.
In the event a dangerous scenario is ongoing, be aware of the additional precautions that may be worth taking to keep yourself safe during the night.
If you’re unsure of the safety of the building in which you’re sleeping during inclement weather, go somewhere else or shelter yourself in an especially sturdy room, such as a basement.
Leave a flashlight or other light source near you while you sleep.
 Ensure that the doors are locked and the windows are secured as best as possible. During extreme weather, you may want to cover or remove glass from your vicinity.


Have someone keep a lookout. Take turns and sleep and monitoring the situation. A lookout can wake everyone up should something disturb the peace and need attending to.
 Knowing that everyone else is safely sleep can be a source of reassurance as you know that everyone will be able to better handle whatever the following day may hold.


If people are still awake, reassure one other. Tell stories and reminisce. Talking will help calm any nerves, and diminish any fear.
Snuggle up. Keep warm, stay together and feel the reassurance of being close to others.

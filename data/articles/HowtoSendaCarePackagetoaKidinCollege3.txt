 Every college student will get sick. Sending them a cold-care kit will help them make the transition to taking care of themselves.Include things like cold medicine, cough drops, vitamin C, and ice packs.
Throw an easy-to-read paperback in the care package if they’ll be in bed for a few days.
You can also use a premade kit available at most drug stores or online.
 Send them a crate of Campbell’s. Nothing helps a cold like chicken noodle soup. A whole crate of soup will let your child know you care and also make them laugh.


You can also include other foods people associate with being sick, like ginger ale or saltine crackers.
 Many college students will be having their first relationships, and some of these will end in heartbreak. If you know your child has recently broken up with their significant other, send them a care package with chocolates and an inspiring book about getting over heartbreak.Try to find a book that’s inspiring and funny. Laughter goes a long way in helping college students get over a relationship.
If it’s not too soon after the breakup, you might consider getting your child a subscription to a dating site like OKCupid or Match.com. It’ll make your child laugh and also give them inspiration to start dating again.

 To make it available for use, for example to add it to the Draw toolbar, open the menu Tools > Customize. Choose the tab Toolbars and in the upper list of toolbars (pulldown list) choose Drawing. Click on Add and select the Category Format and the Command Fontwork. Click Add, then Close and you should now see the button with the arrow in the list of commands under Toolbar Content. Move the tool to the location you want and then OK to confirm and close the dialog.


If you want to write slanting text, two steps are necessary. In the first step text is added to the connector as normal, as described above. The anchor location of the text is not important at this stage. Select the object with the text (in this case the connector) and click on the Fontwork button.






This opens the Fontwork dialog. To make the text lie along the inclined line, click on the Rotate icon and set the distance to the line you wish.
 This opens up many other possibilities to manipulate the text with the button, or place the text under the line by assigning a negative value to the spacing between text and line.


In addition it is possible to use the Fontwork dialog to generate curved text which follows the shape of a curved line. It pays to experiment a little to investigate some of the possibilities.

 If someone can accompany you on the day of your surgery, they can help you in a few ways.


First, he or she can help fill out forms for you and remember the surgeonâ€™s instructions before and after surgery.
This person can also help make your stay in the hospital be as comfortable as possible by assisting you when there is no nurse nearby, ensuring that you have all your necessary items at the ready, and helping you with the commute when it's time to go home.
 Don't focus on potential problems now that you are about to have your surgery.


Although you are having surgery and your life may be restricted for a few weeks, at the end of the day your quality of life will be improved.
Remembering this will shift your focus to your bright future.

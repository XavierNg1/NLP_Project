 If you want to build a simple rubber band gun, you'll need to find a great stick to do it. The best sticks will be hefty and gun-shaped, with a slight curve that you can hold like a handle. So, look around for a good stick about 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) long in total, and about an inch wide, if possible. If it looks gun-shaped, you've got a good one.
 Get an adult to help you, if necessary, to remove the bark and other junk from the outside of the wood. Whittle it away so you've got the clean wood underneath and spend some time sanding it down with some sandpaper. If you're going to go to the trouble to make a gun, you might as well make it look awesome.
 To attach the clothes pin:


Set the clothes pin on the side, so the flat side of the pinchers will be flat against the top of the barrel.
Use wood glue to run a long line of glue along that side of the clothes pin.
Secure it in place and hold it while the glue dries.
 Again, get an adult to help you, and use a knife to cut a small notch in the front of the barrel of the gun, big enough to seat the rubber band in firmly.
 To fire the gun, you'll hook the rubber band on the front of the barrel, then catch it in the clothes pin on the top of the gun. When you're ready to fire, aim the gun where you want it to go, and push the top lever on the clothes pin down. The rubber band should come loose and go flying.


While it might be cool to paint your rubber band gun, you need to be extremely careful to make sure it doesn't look like a real-enough gun to get you into trouble. The last thing you need is someone to call the cops about a kid running around with a gun. Have fun, but be safe.

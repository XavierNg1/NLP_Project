Make it chat all about you, and make it an approachable style (bright and bubbly colors are more open than black, royal purple, navy blue, etc).
 Make everything neat, and organize your backpack by size and/or subject. Your backpack should be easy to reach into and get things as you want them. Remember, the neater your things, the more likely your work will be appreciated and known. Groups will want you to hold their project overnight. You can get lots of credit for it!

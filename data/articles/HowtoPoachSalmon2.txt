 Here's what you'll need to make microwaved poached salmon:









1 diced lemon
4 6 oz. skinless salmon fillets
Salt to taste
1/2 cup chicken broth

, Cut a fresh lemon into thin slices, then place the lemon slices in the bottom of an 8" x 8" (20 cm x 20 cm) baking dish. Arrange four 6-oz., skinless salmon fillets on top of the lemon slices. Sprinkle the salmon fillets with salt to taste, then add 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the pan.
 Use vented wrap or place the plastic loosely on the baking dish. Cook the salmon fillets for about 8 minutes, or until the meat begins to turn opaque.
 Place the salmon fillets on a layer of paper towels to drain, then allow the salmon to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy this microwaved poached salmon while it's hot.

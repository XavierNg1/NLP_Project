 Make sure that there's no car behind you before you try to parallel park. If there is a car behind you, wait for it to pass or pull into a driveway or side-street ahead, and then approach the spot again.
 This will let other cars know that you're parking.
 Shift your transmission down so that you approach the spot at no more than 2–3 mph (3.2–4.8 km/h). If you're driving an automatic car, just lightly press the brake, and if you're driving a manual car, shift down to a lower gear and lightly press the brake.
 It should be at least a foot apart from the car. If it's too close, then you may hit the car when you start moving backward.
, Continue to check your mirrors and blind spots to make sure that the coast is still clear. Turn around before you begin to move backwards.
, If you're driving an automatic car, that's all you need to do. If you're driving a manual car, then you should slowly let go of the clutch as you press the gas. If you're parking on a hill, then you can keep pressing the clutch and just slowly move your foot off the brake.
, Continue to back up until you're fully in the space. You may not get it on your first try. You can move back and steer your wheel away from the curb, then move forward again while steering your wheel toward the curb, and repeat this process until you've got it right.
 Shift it into First Gear if you're driving a manual car, and shift the car into Park if you're driving Pull forward until you're evenly positioned between the car in front of you and the car behind you.
 Keep your foot on the brake as you turn your wheels in the right direction. If you're pulling into a flat spot, just straighten your wheels. If you've parked uphill, you can turn your wheels away from the curb, and if you've parked downhill, you can turn your wheels toward the curb. This will keep your car from rolling away if your brakes are disengaged.
 Pull forward until you're evenly positioned between the car in front of you and the car behind you.

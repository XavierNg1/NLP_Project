 Completing a successful project requires a significant amount of time and work, which means evaluating your priorities and planning your course of action. Schedule specific research time and plan daily, weekly, or monthly targets for your progress (e.g. completing a detailed project outline by the first week).Keep track of your schedule with a smartphone app such as Schedule Planner, a free iphone app that organizes your tasks and deadlines., When looking up books, news articles, or websites, always look for the credentials of the author or creator of a text. Search for the name of the writer(s) to see if they have already been published, or cited in the work of others. Avoid anonymously-written text or any sensational writing that may be geared towards attracting readers rather than conveying facts., When researching a topic, check the date of publication of all of the reference materials that you use. Current information is always ideal, but it is imperative to find the most recent data in dynamic fields such as the sciences. Historical texts, on the other hand, would be an exception.

 Use both positive and negative consequences to train your cocker what to do and what not to do. Give them praise when they do something good and speak firmly with your voice or their lease if they do something bad.When your cocker does something good, reward them. This can be in the form of praise like "good boy" or "good girl," treats, or petting. They will quickly learn to repeat this behavior to get praise from you.
 You can also use their collar or lease to tell your cocker about bad behavior. A strong word or movement can send a firm message to your cocker if they do anything you donâ€™t like.
 Dogs will learn to fear you rather than respect you.


Sometimes dogs won't listen because they are not getting enough attention. This is especially true with social breeds like the cocker. Make sure to get enough time with the cocker to discourage misbehavior.
 Cockers are excitable dogs, so they may try to jump on others. Be firm and teach them to wait for people to pet them first.
 Some dogs prefer women to men or can even hold prejudices against types of clothing. Introduce your cocker to all kinds of people, so they are used to them.


Children are often frightening for dogs, even for dogs great with children like cockers, since they are so unpredictable. Socialize your dog with children early so they get used to being around them.
 Getting along with other dogs and cats is also important for your cocker. Exposure is key for cockers to get used to other animals.

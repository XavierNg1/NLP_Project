 You will need to have both dogs on leashes and kept several feet away from each other, so it is necessary to have two people on hand to make the introduction., Do not try to introduce your dogs in your house or in your back yard. These spaces are your existing dog’s territory and he is more likely to act aggressively when he is in them. Choose a neutral space like a friend’s backyard or a nearby dog park., You may want to stand with your existing dog, since he may feel more threatened if you are standing with the puppy. Make sure that your friend keeps the puppy on its leash and stands about 10 feet away from you., Watch both dogs to see what they do when they are introduced. If you notice that the dogs look relaxed and happy, then you should be able to bring them closer. If one or both dogs is displaying signs of aggression (baring teeth, growling, tense posture), then you should move them further apart., If the dogs become aggressive, stop the introduction by moving them away from each other and distracting the dogs with a treat. Speak calmly to the dogs and try to calm them down. Do not allow the dogs to get closer to each other if they are acting aggressively.If the first attempt resulted in aggressive behavior from one or both dogs, increase the distance between the dogs and try to introduce the dogs again.
Once the dogs have had a positive reaction to each other and had a chance to play a bit, you should be able to take them home.

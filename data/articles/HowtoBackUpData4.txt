 Ideally, this drive should have enough space to fit all of the data from your Mac with plenty of room to spare. This is because Time Machine makes multiple copies over time, and is most effective when you have multiple copies to choose from.

You can connect a drive using USB, Thunderbolt, or FireWire.






If the external drive has not been formatted yet, do so using the Disk Utility. Make sure Mac OS X Extended (Journaled) is selected for the disk format.
 If you haven’t set up Time Machine yet, plugging in an external drive will open a dialog box asking if you want to use it for Time Machine. Click the “Use as Backup Disk” to begin using the drive with Time Machine.If the dialog box does not appear, you can open Time Machine from the System Preferences screen found in your Apple menu.
 Once you have designated a drive as your Time Machine backup, your data will be saved automatically every hour. Your Time Machine will save an hourly copy for the last 24 hours, a daily copy for the last month, and weekly backups for as much space as your external drive permits.

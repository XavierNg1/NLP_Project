 Isolating a variable means getting the variable on one side of an equation by itself.This information should be given to you, or you can figure it out based on what information you know you will be given.

For example, you might be told to solve the area of a triangle formula for h{\displaystyle h}. Or, you might know that you have the area and base of the triangle, so you need to solve for the height. So, you need to rearrange the formula and isolate the h{\displaystyle h} variable.

, Use inverse operations to cancel variables on one side of the equation and move them to the other side. Keep in mind the following inverse operations:

Multiplication and division.

Addition and subtraction.

Squaring and taking a square root.
 Whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must also do to the other side. This ensures that your equation remains true, and in the process you are moving variables from one side to the other as needed.For example, to solve the area of a triangle formula (A=12bh{\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}bh}) for h{\displaystyle h}:

Cancel the fraction by multiplying each side by 2:A×2=2×12bh{\displaystyle A\times 2=2\times {\frac {1}{2}}bh}2A=bh{\displaystyle 2A=bh}

Isolate h{\displaystyle h} by dividing each side by b{\displaystyle b}:2Ab=bhb{\displaystyle {\frac {2A}{b}}={\frac {bh}{b}}}2Ab=h{\displaystyle {\frac {2A}{b}}=h}



Rearrange the formula, if desired: h=2Ab{\displaystyle h={\frac {2A}{b}}}

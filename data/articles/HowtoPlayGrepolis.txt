 You can use your e-mail address, and get extra raw materials for it. You will need to select a world too. It's the easiest to just play on the world which the game moderators picked for you.
 After you do, it will ask you to select a world and pick a direction.
 When you start, there will be a guide to help you start up your town, which will have around 175 points. You'll learn to build buildings and a small army. Next, you'll get your very own farming village, where you'll be able to demand more raw materials to build or find some troops.
 As you'll see, you're not alone on the island. There will be more players, but they'll start around the same time as you did. You'll be protected from attacks on the first few days (the number depends on the world you play in), so in that time, you'll be able to build safely.

, The first thing you need to know is that without raw materials (stone, wood, and silver), you can't build a city! So, upgrade your warehouse to hold more of them, and then you can upgrade your production building.
 In your Farming village(s), you can demand raw materials. Use the 5 minute option when you're online, and when you go offline for a longer time, use the 240 minute (4 hours) option.






Once you build the academy, you can research "Booty" to unlock more options, like an 8 hour one.
 First, you'll want to build barracks, so you can make sword fighters, which are good at defending your town. Find out what the requirements for the building are, and build those first. Then, build about 30 sword fighters. Don't forget to update your farm in time!

 Turtles spend most of their lives in water. Depending on its species, a turtle may inhabit fresh water (ponds and lakes) or the sea., Tortoises are land dwellers. Some tortoises live far from major sources of water, such as in deserts.
 Terrapins spend time both on land and in water. However, they inhabit brackish waters such as marshes. Often the term “terrapin” is only used to refer to certain species living in marshes of the Eastern and Southern United States, such as the Diamondback Terrapin, or the Red-eared Terrapin (also called the Red-eared slider; this is a common pond and pet turtle)., Turtles and terrapins will leave the water to bask in the sun on logs, sand, rocks, and other surfaces.Sea turtles typically spend more time in water, but will leave to bask in the sun on beaches, reefs, and similar areas.

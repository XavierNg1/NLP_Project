 Combination locks require that you input in a series of numbers in the correct order to open the lock. They usually feature dials with numbers from 0-60 or 100, and you need to spin the dial to get the lock to open.;
, Usually, the combination is on a sticker or engraved in the back of the lock. If you cannot find the combination, you will not be able to open the lock unless you can figure out the numbers or break the lock.


As an example, this tutorial will solve for the combination 5 - 45 - 20

, This "resets" the dial, allowing you to input your combination.
 Line up the first number in your combination with the small arrow on the top of the lock. In this case, stop on 5.
 Turn the dial one full rotation, returning to your first number. Make sure your turn -counter-clockwise.


You will pass your second number while spinning, but this is intentional.
For this example, you would return back to 5.
 After making the first full rotation, keep turning the same direction until you reach your second number. Here you would turn all the way to 45.
 After landing on your second number, simply turn the dial to your last number, here 20. This completes your combination.
 Once you've successfully input your combination the lock should easily come off. To review:


Spin the dial 3 times clockwise, landing on your first number.
Spin the dial counterclockwise 1 full rotation before landing on your second number.
Spin the dial clockwise to your final number.
Open the lock., Some combination locks feature multiple dials with the numbers 0-9. To open one, simply turn each dial to create the correct combination. For example, if the combination is 1492, turn the first dial to 1, the second to 4, the third to 9, and the last to 2.


The first number is almost always on the dial closest to the lock.

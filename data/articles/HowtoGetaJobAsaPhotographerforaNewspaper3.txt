 Follow the guidelines of a job description for an open position you’d like to apply for. Submit a well-written and formatted resume and a cover letter that illustrates why you want this specific job and why you would be the best fit for it. Send in a digital or physical copy of your portfolio.
 For any newspaper you’d like to work for, read back issues or check their website to see the kind of stories they typically write and the style of photography they’re used to. Try to show some of your work that most reflects their style, but be true to your own style too, and don’t be afraid to surprise them with something they haven’t seen before.
 Be on time for an interview if you’re asked to come into the newspaper offices for a job interview. Be prepared for the interview by dressing professionally, being prepared to answer common questions about your photography work and experience, and have questions prepared for the newspaper staff.
 Even if you don’t land your ideal job at your first-choice newspaper, stick to your goal. Keep checking job listing sites and talking to other photographers and journalists to make connections and be the first to know about new opportunities. Simply keep visiting editors to show them new images as you have them, especially if you know a photographer of theirs is leaving soon.

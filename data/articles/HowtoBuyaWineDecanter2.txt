 Most decanters are meant to hold one glass at a time, but larger options are available. The largest decanter you'll want is one made for a bottle of wine. Any bigger, and you're reducing the surface area of wine exposed to air (and thus its effectiveness)., Unless you're buying an antique decanter, these will be your options. Crystal decanters are durable and decorative, allowing for more intricate designs. Glass is cheaper and more resistant to corrosion.Do not buy crystal decanters made before 1969, as these are usually made of lead crystal. Lead crystal can leach out into your drink and cause poisoning.Crystal decanters are known for their clarity. Even the cleanest glass decanters will be slightly foggier.
 After sitting in a decanter from 18-24 hours, your wine will lose its flavor without a stopper. If you don't plan on drinking your wine directly after serving, use a stopper to preserve its flavor and aroma (especially if you're serving an aged wine). Not all decanters come with a stopper, so keep this in mind while shopping.Remove the stopper around an hour before serving so your wine has time to aerate.
Wine will last between 3-5 days with a stopper, on average. Sparkling wine will not last as long, and light or fortified wine will last longer., If you have a preference for red or white wines, you could buy a decanter specially made for your favorite kind. White wine decanters keep the drink at a cooler temperature, and red wine decanters usually have thinner necks for separating sediment.

You can also choose decanters made for a only one type of wine, like merlot, chardonnay, or pinot noir decanters.

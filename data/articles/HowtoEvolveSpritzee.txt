 A Sachet is an in-game item, and when used on certain Pokémon, it causes special effects. A Sachet is a small purple perfume sack that is used to evolve Spritzee. In Pokémon X and Y, you can get Sachet from these locations:


Kalos Route 12 — Look behind the ranch house and you’ll see a bush. Use any grass-type Pokémon that has the “Cut” skill and cut that bush to get a Sachet.
Cyllage City — Head to the southern part of the city where you’ll see a house. Go inside the house and make your way to the kitchen where you’ll see a man. Talk to that man and he’ll give you a Sachet.
Battle Maison — Get at least 32 Battle Points and trade it for a Sachet.;
, Open your bag, select the Sachet, and choose Spritzee from the list of Pokémon you can give it to.
 Spritzee will only evolve to Aromatisse once it gets traded with another player using the game’s trading system. Trading systems and its locations vary depending on the game you’re playing.


For newer generations (fourth to X and Y), trading Pokémon are done using the GTS, or Global Trade Stations. To trade using the GTS, go inside a Pokémon Center in any town and talk to the receptionist (non-playable character) in charge of the system.
 Ask one of your friends to trade Pokémon with you. Select Spritzee from the list and trade it with any Pokémon the other player has or is willing to exchange. Once the other player receives Spritzee, its evolution will start and will change to Aromatisse.
 Ask the other player to start another trade so you can have Aromatisse back.


You can choose to skip this step if you prefer not to get your evolved Aromatisse back.

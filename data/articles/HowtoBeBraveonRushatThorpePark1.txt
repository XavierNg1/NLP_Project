 It's very helpful to have friends with you because it's likely they'll be a little nervous too but if they've been on it before they can tell you how fun it is and how you'd be missing out if you didn't go on it.;
, It really helps to look sideways when you're very high because you can still see where you are and you get to see your friends hilarious facial expressions! After being on it a few times you can try looking down.
 There's only a lap bar holding you in this ride but it's perfectly safe and if it had shoulder bars it would be boring! When the staff are locking the bars in place make sure you push your bar down nice and tight so you don't slip about in the seat, you will feel safe and less scared. never trust the staff to do it for you, they don't always push it down far enough. ignore what people say about how you feel like you're going to fall out, you don't.
 When it starts it doesn't go very high, it's fun if you put your arms up but grab on as soon as it gets higher.

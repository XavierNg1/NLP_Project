 Embossing doesn’t work on pre-treated clothing or accessories.;
, You can use a charm or purchase a leather stamp in the design of your choice online. You can order custom leather stamps through sellers on Etsy.


If you use a metal charm, make sure it has cut edges, rather than a tapered design. It will make your shape appear more pronounced in the leather.
 The front side should be facing up. It must be near the edge of a table on which you can hook a strong C-clamp.
 You don’t want it to be sopping wet, so squeeze it out several times.
 Move the leather so that it can fit under the clamp.
, Crank the clamp until it is clamped as far as it will go.
 Seal the leather with leather finish, if you want to improve the durability of the design and surface of the leather.


Leather finish should be applied after all embossing is complete. It should also be done before you sew or complete assembly on a leather project.

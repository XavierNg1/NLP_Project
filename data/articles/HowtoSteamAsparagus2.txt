 Focus on the ends when you wash it, as this is where dirt and grit are most likely to collect. Once the asparagus is clean, use a vegetable peeler to remove the scales. Lastly, hold the asparagus by each end and bend it. It will snap right where the woody part ends and the tender part begins. Discard the hard, woody part. For more details on preparing asparagus, see the section on preparing, above.


Consider cutting the asparagus into smaller, bite-sized pieces.
 Fill a large pot with 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of water, and place a steamer basket on top. The bottom of the steamer basket should not be touching the water.
 If you have not already, move the pot to the stove.
 For thin asparagus, this will take 3 to 5 minutes. For thick asparagus, it will take 6 to 8 minutes., The asparagus should look bright green. Stick a fork or knife into one of the stems. If the asparagus is slightly tender, then it's done. If it is hard, then replace the lid and let it steam for another minute.


Do not overcook the asparagus, or it will become limp and mushy and lose its bright color.
 Place it in a serving dish and serve hot.
 Fill a skillet with ½ cup (120 milliliters) of water per ½ pound (225 grams) of asparagus.Add the asparagus, and cover the skillet with a lid. Boil over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, or until the asparagus turns bright green and tender. Drain the water and serve the asparagus immediately.

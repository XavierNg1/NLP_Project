 Getting the right fertilizer ratio, 5-10-5, is important when trying to get the Hoya to bloom.The number in the middle (10) is phosphorus which promotes flowering. It should be higher than the first number (5) which is nitrogen because nitrogen causes stem and leaf growth. The third number (5) is potassium which supports light absorption. It should be about equal to the first number.
 Begin fertilizing again in the spring to give it the nutrients it needs to grow and bloom.
 The usual dilution rate is 1 teaspoon in a gallon of water but it may be slightly different, depending on the fertilizer you choose.


Check the label on the bottle and follow the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations.
 Pale leaves and stems and a slow growth rate are indications that the Hoya is not getting enough fertilizer.If that occurs, increase the frequency to twice a month.


When the Hoya is getting fertilizer too often, the new leaves are darker green and smaller and the stem length between the leaves becomes shorter. Reduce the frequency to every five to six weeks if that happens.
 Giving fertilizer to a dry Hoya could damage its roots.

 Before applying any medication on your cat, speak with your vet. If the vet prescribes the medication during an appointment, you may be able to ask them for a demonstration for proper application. If you are using an over-the-counter treatment, it is still advisable to call your vet and make sure you are using the right treatment.Be sure to ask your vet about potential side effects and complications during application. Some medication may sting, for example, and thus may require planning before application.;
, In addition to talking to your vet, be sure to carefully read the medication packaging before you apply any topical treatment. Read the directions to find out how much medication to apply at a time, how and where to apply the medication on your pet, and how frequently to reapply the treatment.If directions are missing from the packaging, or if you have any questions regarding application and use of the medication, reach out to your vet for clarification.
Take note of any warnings, as well. Some medication may cause irritation in the eye area, for example, and thus should not be used near that area.
 Some topical medications may suggest the use of gloves for protection or tools to properly administer medication. Gather any supplies you need to successfully apply the treatment. Check the packaging or consult with your vet to see what tools may be necessary.

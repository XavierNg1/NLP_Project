 There are a variety of different computer software programs that can be used for making a wedding program. Familiarize yourself with a few programs and decide on the one that you like the best. Some common programs include:Adobe Photoshop
Adobe Illustrator
Adobe InDesign
MS Publisher
Pages (for Mac users)

, Many websites have free downloadable templates that you can use to make your wedding program. You can then add some custom finishes to give the program your own personal touch.


Search online for a free wedding program template.
If you decide not to use a template, organize the program in chronological order. Begin by introducing the bride a groom, followed by the order of the ceremony, and end with a quick thank you note to all your guests.
 Make sure that you thoroughly edit your program before printing. You donâ€™t want to print 200 copies only to find that you have misspelled the name of your husband-to-be!

, It is a good idea to print your program on a thick paper. A variety of colors and thicknesses are available at your local office supply store. In order to ensure that the formatting and colors are correct, you should print one program first and then make adjustments as needed.


Have your programs printed at a local print shop, if you don't have the supplies to print all of the programs from home.
 Depending on the style of program you have selected, you may need to fold the programs once the ink has had a few seconds to dry. Take your time to carefully line up the two sides before making a crisp and straight crease. Some styles to consider include:


Traditional card centre fold (vertical or horizontal).
Brochure style (three folds).
Single sheet printed on front and back (no fold).

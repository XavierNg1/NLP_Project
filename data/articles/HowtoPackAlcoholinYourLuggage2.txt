 On most flights, you are only allowed to drink alcohol that is served by the airline. For example, Federal Aviation Administration regulations in the United States prohibit the consumption of alcohol on board unless it is served by the airline. This means it is a direct violation of federal regulations to drink alcohol you take on board in your carryon luggage., Federal regulators set standards for the amount of liquids, gels, and aerosols that passengers can take on board in their carry on luggage. For U.S. flights, the Federal Aviation Administration requires that liquids, including alcohol, be in containers that are no more than 100 milliliters or 3.4 ounces in volume. These containers must all fit into a 1-quart-sized resealable plastic bag., Duty-free alcohol purchased internationally can be carried on board inbound international flights to the United States. The alcohol can be in containers larger than 3.4 ounces or 100 milliliters if packed in a secure, transparent, tamper-evident bag by the retailer. The purchase must have been made within the last 48 hours, and you must have the original receipt present during your flight.If you have a connecting flight after reentering the U.S., however, you will have to go through security again and the duty-free alcohol will then be subject to the 3.4 ounces or 100 milliliter regulation for liquids in carryon luggage.

 Crown molding will be especially important if you’re trying to finish a basement in an older style home. This can help the two levels look more alike, if there is molding elsewhere in the home.
 Baseboards and trim will go a long ways towards helping your basement to look like a real room and installing is a breeze, if you can measure and cut (which you totally can!).
 If you want to make your basement rooms look bigger, stick to a very light-colored paint scheme. White walls, carpet, and large furniture pieces, mixed in with a few pale blue accents, will make a room look much larger.
 If you want your basement to look less cramped and cave-like, try to make the ceiling look higher by employing a few visual tricks. The easiest of these is to avoid low-hanging light fixtures and ceiling fans, and to paint the ceiling white.
 Get Mr. the space he’s always needed and out of Mrs.’ hair. A man-cave can be a great way to add entertaining space to a home. Pair with a craft room for Mrs. and everyone will be happy!

, Bars go well in basements, as you’ll have less to worry about in terms of annoying the neighbors when you get friends together to drink. You can buy one or build your own, with a little carpentry work!

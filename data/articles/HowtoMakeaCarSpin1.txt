 On dirt you want to go about half that, preferably in 2nd gear with full throttle.;
, On an automatic transmission lightly touch the brake with your left foot, while keeping the right foot over the throttle.
, Hold the safety button with your thumb at the same time. Continue steering until your steering wheel is locked. This is much easier on cars equipped with power steering, as you have to steer using only one hand.
 This is perceived as a moment of weightlessness.
 If you release the handbrake first, your car will stop spinning and start turning normally, possibly hitting the curb or driving off the road!

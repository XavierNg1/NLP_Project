 Pour the sugar and water into a bowl and stir until you no longer see individual grains of sugar. This will improve the texture of your slushie.
 Use 1 1/2 teaspoons of your favorite flavored extract and 5 to 10 drops of food coloring to match. The following color and flavor combinations result in deliciously appealing slushies:


Raspberry extract and blue food coloring
A combination of cherry and vanilla extract and red food coloring
A combination of lemon and lime extract with yellow and green food coloring
Orange extract with orange food coloring

, Since you don't want the slushie mixture to freeze as solid as ice cream, just pour it into your ice cream maker and process it for about 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, check the slushie mixture to see if it's the right consistency, and keep processing if necessary., You'll have enough for two large or four small slushies. Enjoy them with a straw for the classic experience.

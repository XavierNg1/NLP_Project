 As a parent, you should model good consenting behavior for your child. This will normalize consent for your child. Many children learn about how to act with others by watching their parents. One way you can model good behavior is to ask your child for their consent on a regular basis. Before you touch your child, you should ask for their consent so they understand the importance of saying “yes.”For example, before you grab hold of your child’s hand, you may ask, “Can I hold your hand?” Wait until your child says “yes” to then hold their hand.
Or if you are helping your child in the bathroom, you may ask, “May I help you with your underwear?”

, Your child should feel they have power and control over their bodies. One way you can make them feel this is way is to listen and respect what they have to say. Pay attention when they talk about how they feel and encourage them to talk about their feelings. This will allow them to feel comfortable with expressing themselves around you and feel they can trust you.As you listen to your child speak, ask open ended questions. Be a good listener so your child feels they can share their feelings and be honest about how they are feeling.
For example, your child may say to you, “I’m tired today.” You may then respond by asking, “Why are you tired?” or “Why do you think you are so tired?”

, As a parent, you should get in the habit of demonstrating consent in front of your child when you are around other adults. This means asking a person you just met, “Can I give you a hug?” before you hug them in front of your child. Model consent for your child so they know how to do it themselves.You should also be willing to stop a behavior if the person is uncomfortable. For example, if a family member you are tickling says “stop” or “no,” you should stop tickling them.

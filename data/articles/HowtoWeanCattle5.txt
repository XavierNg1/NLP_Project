 Following the steps above in the sections "Preconditioning Calves Prior to Weaning" and "The Actual Traditional Low-Stress Weaning Process," separate cows from the calves into adjacent paddocks where they can see and possibly sniff each other but the fence does not allow any suckling to occur.


Placing page wire and strands of electric wire on either side of the fence is a good way to keep from calves and cows from getting back to each other. Having a two-layered fence built may also help prevent the more desperate mothers from getting back to their calves.
 Allow this interaction for the next 3 to 5 days, until you see the cows and calves losing interest in each other.
 If you wish, you can move the cows to another pasture after this weaning process has gone through.

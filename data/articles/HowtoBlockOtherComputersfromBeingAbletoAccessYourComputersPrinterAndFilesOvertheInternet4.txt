 This will help protect your computer by making it more difficult for hackers to access it through your Wi-Fi. Even if you have a password set up, this will further aid the protection of your computer.
 This will be in your wireless settings, under the tab that says “Wireless Security.” Don’t choose the tab that says “Security,” that’s for other settings. If you don’t have a password, set one up here.


Don’t make it a weak password. It should include non-dictionary words, special characters, and numbers.
Write this password somewhere that you’ll remember it.
 There will be a dropdown menu next to “Security Mode.” Click this and scroll to WPA2 personal. This home security system is much more difficult than the standard security system to crack. (The standard is the WEP).

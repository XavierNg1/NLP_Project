 Eyes of Ender can be bought from priest villagers for roughly 8 emeralds each.


To craft Eyes of Ender, right-click a crafting table, and place blaze powder into the leftmost column of the 3x3 group of boxes. Drag and place an ender pearl to the middle box of the group. Once done, left-click the Eye of Ender that appears on the right to craft it

, Drag it into the first slot in the bottom row of your inventory, press 1, and right-click to use the Eye of Ender.
 The eye will begin leading the path to the location of an End portal. It will first travel above the surface until the player is near the X and Z coordinates of the portal. As the eye moves, it will leave a purple trail that you can follow to help keep track of it.


Once the eye reaches the horizontal coordinates, it will travel downwards toward the portal (because all End portals are underground). After a few seconds, the eye will either drop to the ground to be collected again or be destroyed. It has a 1-in-5 chance of being destroyed each time it is used.
 Do so once the End portal is located. This will place the Eyes of Ender in them.


One or two of these blocks may already have Eyes of Ender in them. If this is the case, skip these blocks, and continue filling the frame until all of the frame is filled and the portal opens.
 Jump into the End portal to be instantly transported to the End. Be careful as this is a one-way portal. That means if you enter it, the only way to get out is to beat the final boss (the Ender Dragon) or die.

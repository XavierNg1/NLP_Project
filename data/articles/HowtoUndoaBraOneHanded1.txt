 Volunteer to do the laundry. Make sure no one is around, and then take a look at your mom's or sister's bra. It might seem weird at first, but it can take a while to learn to unhook a bra with both hands, and this is an easy way to get some practice.


You can buy a bra cheap at a thrift store--just pretend you are shopping for your girlfriend or for a costume party.
You can order something online that is like a fabric bracelet that clasps around your wrist using the exact eyelet and hooks you would find on a bra. You can use this to practice unhooking the bracelet with your free hand.
If you're a girl then it's a little easier and you can practice with your own bra.;
, Most bras have two wide straps (or bands) that connect across the back. A series of hooks are stitched to the end of the left strap (assuming the person wearing the bra is facing you), and eyelets sewn on the right strap. (If the person has their back to you, then the hooks will be on the right and the eyelets on the left.) There may be one hook and one eyelet, or somewhere between 2 and 5 rows and columns of hooks and eyelets.Some front-fastening bras have one large hook that slides down into a loop of fabric, rather than side to side or forward and back, like with the hook and eyelet.
 You can fasten the bra around a pillow or rolled up sleeping bag--something roughly the size of a human torso. This will pull the bra strap taut so you can practice when there is tension in the strap.


You may want to start by just hooking and unhooking the bra when it is loose and there is no tension in the strap so you can get the feel for how the eyelets hook and unhook.
Practice using first one hand, then the other, to see which one feels better. It may not necessarily be your dominant hand.

 It should be much longer than it is thick. A large, lightweight scarf works best. The bigger the material you use, the larger the turban will be, so choose accordingly. Also, thinner materials will be easier to handle.
 Start with the front of the scarf centered over your forehead. Lie the fabric over your whole head and pull the two ends to the nape of your neck. Tie a knot there.Like the full turban, this wrap will cover your whole head, and only has one knot.
 Bring the two ends toward the front and criss cross them around the top of your head. Take the ends and bring them back to the knot at the nape of your neck. Fold the excess fabric underneath the back section of the turban.

 It is ok to take the time to think before you answer someone’s question, or before you move on to the next point. Before answering a question or moving on, give yourself five to eight seconds to think about what you want to say and how you want to say it. This will enable you to be more articulate and descriptive, and you can avoid using the word “like.”, Do this instead of saying “like” in between phrases or at the end of sentences. Instead, pause and take a breath when you are speaking. This will allow you time to think about what you want to say next.For example, when you feel yourself about to say “like,” instead, pause. Then continue your sentence or start a new sentence.
 Do this if thinking and pausing before you speak are not helping you slow down your speech. Stand in front of the mirror and repeat phrases out loud to yourself. While you are saying the phrases, focus on enunciating syllables and vowel sounds. Practice this for 10 minutes each day.Phrases you can practice saying are, “I like to speak slowly,” or, “Speaking slower is more fun.”
Alternatively, read a book or magazine article out loud to yourself. While you are reading, focus on saying the words slowly and prolonging the vowels. Practice this for 10 to 20 minutes each day.

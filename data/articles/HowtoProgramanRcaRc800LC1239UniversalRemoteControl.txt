 The user manual that accompanied the remote listed the following number for the remote on the cover: "CRCU805MSL". It's not clear if this is the model number for the remote control unit because the numbering scheme does not match those of other RCA remote control units.


There is also a number for the remote printed on a white sticker located inside the battery compartment. You should see the sticker once you remove the battery cover. There are 2 lines to this number, the first appears to relate to the model itself (e.g.: RC800L-C), and the second is the "Date Code" for the particular product (e.g.: 1239).;
,, The "CODE SEARCH" button is the oval button located right below the CH- (Channel Down) button.
 The red indicator light will blink and then remain ON.
 If your code is something like "032", make sure to enter the first "0", and not just "32"Â !


After you have entered the code, the indicator light will turn OFF. If the code is not valid, the indicator light will blink. If your code is invalid, check the code list and repeat the process (from Step 2) using another code for you brand of TV.
 Your TV should turn OFF.
 If the TV responds, no further programming is required.

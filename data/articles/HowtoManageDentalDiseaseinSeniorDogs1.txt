 You should take your dog for dental checkups two more times each year. During oral checkups, your vet can examine the state of your aging dog’s teeth to make sure they stay healthy.The vet may be able to see a problem that you can’t see. They can do x-rays and other imaging tests to look deeper into the gums for problems.;
, When your dog ages, the health of their teeth often declines, too. This often leads to teeth that become loose or infected near the root. Instead of getting the tooth cleaned or fixed, you should consider having bad or decayed teeth removed. Dogs can easily live with missing or no teeth.This helps protect the health of your senior dog. Infections from decaying teeth can spread throughout their bodies, causing problems with their organs.
Teeth cleanings cause the dog to be put under anesthesia, which can be problematic for older dogs.
 Many times, dental disease in older dogs can cause pain. It can also lead to infections in the gum tissue. If your dog has an infection or is experiencing extreme pain, your vet may prescribe medication for them to take to help.If your dog has an infection in their gum, your vet may give your dog medication to get rid of the infection before they can extract the tooth.

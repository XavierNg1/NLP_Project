 When you see a paragraph or sentence you want to comment on, either (a) highlight it by holding your finger on it until it turns blue then click the button that says 'comment' or (b) if someone's already commented, click on the button next to the paragraph that looks like a speech mark., Voting is a great aspect of the Wattpad community that is comparable to liking something on Facebook.

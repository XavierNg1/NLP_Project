 You can also open the Epic Breeding Island.;
, To make an Air dragon you'll need a Fire dragon and a Water dragon.
 The amount of time it takes varies depending on the type of dragon.


Alternatively, you can use gems to speed up the process, though it is not recommended since youâ€™ll just waste gems.
 The egg will be white with a tint of purple- and cyan-colored swirls.
 It takes about 2 hours for an Air dragon egg to hatch.
 This is so your Air dragon can be used for breeding.


Dragons can only start breeding when they reach level 4.
 Water dragons are 500,000 gold each.


The only other way to obtain this dragon is by breeding two Water dragons together, which seems to be counterproductive.
 Do this until it reaches level 4 and above.
 Again, you can alternately access the Epic Breeding Island.
 These two types of dragons are needed to breed a Rain dragon.


The Epic Breeding Island may increase the chances of you getting a Rain dragon.
 Time varies based on type of dragon.
 A Rain dragon's egg is violet with three blue waves.


If you got the wrong egg, re-breed the dragons until you get the Rain dragon egg.
 It takes 8 hours for a Rain dragon's egg to hatch.
 Congratulations, you now have a Rain dragon!

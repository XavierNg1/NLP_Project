 Before searching for a channel or app, consider the following:Which sports you want to watch. In addition to the kind of sport (e.g., hockey, baseball, etc.), do you want to watch live sports, or are you content with highlight reels?
Whether or not you're okay with blackouts. If you want to watch local sports for free without worrying about a channel blackout, your options will be significantly more limited.
Whether or not you have a cable subscription. Most of the top-tier live streaming channels will require a cable subscription that you'll use to log into the app.
 Some of Apple TV's official free sports channels/apps are:

, Sling TV is a pay-per-month channel hub that covers services like ESPN; if you decide to use Sling, you can actively watch your preferred live sports during their active seasons and then cancel your subscription immediately after your seasons end. This way, you don't end up paying for a year-round cable package to watch three months of sports.

Sling's most comprehensive package is $40 per month, while lesser packages run $20 to $25 per month.
Sling also has a myriad of non-sports channels, including channels from Disney to National Geographic.

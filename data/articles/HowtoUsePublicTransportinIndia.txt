 India is a vast country with many big metropolitan cities. Decide your destination and look for the shortest way to reach it.


If you are travelling to a different city/ state, it is advisable to use the train (railway) service. India has one of the largest railway networks in the world, connecting around 7,500 stations throughout the country.

An alternative to railways is the bus service. Buses are slower modes of transport, but connect various small parts of India which aren't covered by the railways, yet.

Bus services are provided most of the state's governments. Private services are available too.


If you are travelling intra-city (within a city), try opting for the local railway services. Local railways are the backbones of various Indian metropolitan cities (including, but not limited to: Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai).


Getting on local trains can be difficult, especially during peak hours. Hundreds of thousands of people use these services everyday.
Use local-bus services. Services from BEST (Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport) and similar agencies make the transportation within a city much easier.

, Public transport will be crowded and you'll, usually (during office timings), not find a place to sit. Understand that this is a pain many other people are going through too.
 Long distant transport services like trains and buses occasionally get delayed. Carry the items necessary for your trip.


If you are travelling with children, carry adequate amount of food and water. Keep in mind that you just want to carry adequate, not a lot!
Carry tissues and hand sanitizer. Do not expect the services to be very clean and tidy. Learn to adjust.
 Carrying additional valuables will only tempt people to steal it. Carry only those which is required for the journey.

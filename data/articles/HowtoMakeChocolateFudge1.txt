 Just place the chocolate squares into the pan and pour the condensed milk over them. Heating the ingredients over low heat will allow them to combine without thickening too much. As the pan heats up, stir the ingredients together using a wooden spoon. You can also use chocolate chips instead of chocolate squares, if you prefer. Continue stirring until the ingredients are thoroughly melted together and you've created a nice, even mixture.


You should insert a candy thermometer into the mixture. It's done when the temperature reaches 240°F (115°C).;
, Now, add the remaining ingredients to the melted mixture and stir them together until all of the ingredients are thoroughly combined. The stirred product should be rich and creamy, not chunky. Once the mixture has reached its desired temperature and everything is mixed together, you can remove it from the heat.
 Once the ingredients are combined, you should pour them into a pan as carefully as you can.
 This will give the chocolate fudge enough time to set.
 Just cut the fudge into 1 inch (2.5 centimeter) squares and serve it. It's tasty enough to be enjoyed on its own, though you can always have it with a glass of milk or even a cup of vanilla ice cream.

 This won't affect the taste and is simple to remedy. Either ice or frost it, or pass it off as a deliberately striped cake, which kids will find delightful.


If there is a band or collar of a darker shade around the top of your cake, this shows that it was baked at too high a temperature.
A cake with a pale top can be caused by having the parchment lining rise too high above the cake, or using a pan that is too large.

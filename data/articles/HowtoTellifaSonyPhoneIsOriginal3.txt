 Before you shell out money for a new Xperia X4200, make sure Sony actually released a model with that name (in this case, they didn’t). You should be able to find the exact model number of the phone for sale by searching for it at http://www.sonymobile.com/us//. Just click the magnifying glass at the top of the page to launch the search box.


If you’ve found a model that exists but that Sony has not yet released, it’s a fake.
 If the phone you want to buy goes for $799 and you’ve found it for $400, chances are it’s not legitimate. You won’t see drastically different pricing on the same phone model unless one is used, defective, or fake., Buy your Sony phone from Sony, your network provider, or a retailer you trust. If you’re buying a used phone from an individual online, verifying their identity can be tricky. The seller should have many positive reviews, and will be willing to give you the IMEI number for verification.See Sony’s list of authorized dealers at http://www.sony.com/retailers.

 Before you do anything, you need to have a plan. Brainstorm ideas for a plot, and go over and edit it as many times necessary.


Depending on the length of your film, you're going to want a good conflict. Come up with a believable setting, theme, mood, and characters.;
, You can't make a film all on your lonesome, now can you? You need crew members such as actors, cameraman, costumes/props designer, etc. You don't need to go all Hollywood, though. Most of the work required is DIY.
 Fallout takes place in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, so it's probably not a good idea to shoot it in Disneyland. Some good places might be ghost towns, forest areas, plain fields, parks, abandoned buildings/lots, etc.
 You want it to seem as realistic as possible. You don't need everything ready before you start, you just need the actors.
 You will at the very least need a good camera, and if your pocket allows it, a mic (or two) and tripod stand.
 You can order merchandise online, or make your own. There are many tutorials online on how to make costumes and props.
 You're at the juiciest part now! Watch your hard work come to life as your idea jumps from paper to live action.
 You want it to be a good quality, right? Make smooth scene transitions, and know when to add music to the background and when to cut it off.
 Be sure to collect opinions from the entire crew as a whole. Once everyone is satisfied, you can be sure that your audience will be as well.
 Stand back and look at your masterpiece, and be proud of what you have accomplished.

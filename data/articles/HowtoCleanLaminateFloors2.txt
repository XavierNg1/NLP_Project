 The water does not need to be steaming hot, but it should be more than simply lukewarm.


A thorough, wet wash should be performed every few months or after a wide area of the floor has gotten muddy or notably dirty.
Hot water is often considered one of the best ways to clean laminate flooring because, when done correctly, it will not leave streaks. It is also the least likely to damage the protective coating of the laminate, since water is the mildest cleanser possible.
 Soak a sponge mop in the hot water and wring it out so that it is only mildly damp.









You could use a traditional-style mop, but it is easier to control the saturation level of sponge mops.
The mop should be wrung out well before using it. Even water can stain or warp the laminate floor if it is allowed to sit on the floor in puddles. That being the case, the mop should only be mildly damp before you use it on the laminate.










You could also work from one side of the room to the other. The only method you should avoid is working from the exterior of the room to the center, since you will need to walk across the newly-cleaned floor as it dries in order to leave the room.
Since the mop is only barely damp, you may need to re-soak and re-wring it a few times during the cleaning process.
 If the laminate is barely moist, you can let it air dry. Otherwise, wipe it dry with a clean, dry, microfiber cloth.









Do not use an abrasive cloth, since this may scratch the flooring.
Do not let puddles of water sit on the laminate for long periods of time.

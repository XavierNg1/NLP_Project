 You need to have either a reminder for an event on your Google Calendar, or an invite to someone else's Google Calendar event for the Event Preview to appear in your inbox. The reminder or invite will also need to have been delivered via email.


When creating events in your own Google Calendar, you can set email reminders in the event settings.
Event emails from other calendar systems (Facebook, iCal, etc.) will show up as regular emails with no Event Preview.;
, By default, all of your event notification emails are bundled in your Updates label. If you've recently received an event email, it may be in the Updates bundle in your inbox. If you received it a while ago and marked it as Done, open the Google Inbox menu and then open the Updates label.


You must receive an email reminder for the event in order to see it in Google Inbox.
 Inbox will create a preview of the Event beneath the reminder message. It will display the name of the event along with the date and time.
 You will be able to see a list of people attending.
 You may be asked which app you want to use to open your calendar in if you have a Google Calendar app or multiple browsers installed on your device.

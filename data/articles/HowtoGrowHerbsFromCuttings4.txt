 Because the process of creating new roots causes stress to the cut stem, the existing foliage may rot or dry out. Remove any dried or rotten leaves, and remove any flowers that may form during the rooting process.
 Keep the rooting medium moist at all times. Hand-mist the cuttings several times an hour for the first several days. If you can't hand-mist regularly, create a humid atmosphere around the cuttings with a plastic tent, such as a food storage bag. Be sure the tent does not touch the leaves or they may rot. Commercial propagation boxes also are available at most garden centers.
 Keep the soil temperatures between 65 and 80 degrees F (18.3 and 26.7 degrees C).
 The process of regeneration requires light for photosynthesis. However, direct sunlight will burn the fragile cuttings. Place the cuttings in a north-facing window or provide artificial lighting.

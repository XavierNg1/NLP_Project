 This is how you begin each new pay period. This step clears out all of the data from the previous pay period. Then, it advances the system to the new pay period.


Go to the payroll cycle page.
Click on “Process” in the task bar at the top of the page.
In the pop-up menu, under “Payroll,” select “Payroll Cycle.”;
, If your business has more than one company that processes payroll, confirm the correct company code. To change the company code, click on the magnifying glass icon and select the correct company code.


If you don’t have more than one company, do nothing.
 Click on the green “Start New Cycle” icon. A popup window will appear that displays dates and deduction information for the upcoming pay period. Verify the week number, pay date and period end date. If you need to change any of this information, click on “Change Starting Week” to update it. Also, verify the scheduled deductions and special effects for the pay period. If all of this data is correct, click “Continue” in the bottom left-hand corner of the window.
 After you click “Continue” in the above step, a popup window appears that displays the processing status. You will see a spinning circle to indicate that the system is processing the new cycle data. Once the process is complete, you will be returned to the payroll cycle page.


Notice that the green “Start New Cycle” icon is now dimmed, and the other icons for processing payroll are now activated.

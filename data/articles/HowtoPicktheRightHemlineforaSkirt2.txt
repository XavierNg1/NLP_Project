 Mini skirts tend to have a hemline that falls out over the widest part of your thighs, accentuating this problem area. Look for hemlines that stop a couple of inches above or below your knee to balance out your legs.
 If your legs are full from top to bottom, a mini skirt may help elongate your leg by showing off more skin. An elongated leg also means a slenderized leg.
 Women who carry excess weight around their stomachs need longer hemlines to keep their body looking proportioned. Short hemlines will only draw further attention to a large midsection.
 Try a mini skirt if you feel proud of your toned legs, or look for a fit-and-flare skirt with a hemline just below the knee if you want to make your muscular calves look slimmer.
 Not many women can pull of the midi skirt because it lands at the thickest part of the calves, which generally makes your legs look stout. If you have slender calves, however, you can usually wear a midi without worry.
 Baggy clothes do flatter plus sized women and tend to make them look dowdy. Instead of a long, baggy skirt, opt for a knee-length skirt with a little stretch and flare.
 If your entire frame is thin, the excess fabric of a maxi skirt may threaten to swallow you up. If you do opt for a maxi skirt regardless, look for a sleek style that hugs your hips and thighs to reduce the amount of excess fabric.

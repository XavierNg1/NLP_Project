 You may have difficulty with this pose at first, but practicing will help you become much more flexible and balance-focused.
 Like the shoulder stand, you'll need to practice this one to get the hang of it. Unlike the shoulder stand, this exercise helps your shoulders by opening them up rather than using them to support the rest of your body.
 The shoulder rotation here is critical; without it your shoulders will receive very little attention.
 These are a good way to wind down your workout--you can even do them on the floor if you like.

 There are many alternatives when it comes to baking brie. Try cranberry baked brie for a sweet, autumn twist. Cheesy goodness? Oh yeah. Good luck waiting for it to be done!

, That's when you take a small wheel of brie and cover it with puff phyllo pastry, brush it with an egg wash, and bake it until the pastry is golden. There are a billion variations -- often with raspberry or other jam spread on top of the brie or with nuts thrown in. It's effortless and yet still delicious.
 What could be better than baked salmon stuffed with a mellow and creamy brie filling along with peppers, onion and crisp pine nuts? Brie doesn't have to go with sweet jams or fruits -- it can be savory, too!

, Great for casual gatherings or a snack for yourself! It can spice up any otherwise casual get-together. Brie ball, anyone? Just remember to load up on pretzels and crackers!

, Maybe a little bacon, avocado, black forest ham, mustard, marinara sauce, basil, cranberry, mushrooms -- brie practically goes with everything. Slab it on a sandwich and it would surely be delicious. Heck, make your grilled cheese sandwich with it!

, Now that you're familiar with the miracle that is brie, what can you think of to do with it? Throw it on a burger? Class up your french fries? Put it in your salad? At the very least use up your wheel before it goes bad!

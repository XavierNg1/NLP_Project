 For example, consider 'ph'. This doesn't sound like you might think based on the pronunciation of p and h separately. Instead, it sounds like an "f". Rare exceptions are usually compound words like haphazard or flophouse.


Ph: Makes an "f" sound. Ex: Phoenix (fee-nix. This is just how it is pronounced.) Your top teeth should be on bottom your lip. Your mouth should be kind of open, kind of closed. Now all you have to do is blow gently.
Th: One of the most common consonant sounds in English, but can be difficult to describe to speakers of languages where this sound isn't used. Place your tongue on the bottom of your top front teeth and blow gently like you did when you made the Ph sound. Ex: the word The. The "e" in this word can either be pronounced either with a long e (for emphasis) or as a schwa in most other cases.;

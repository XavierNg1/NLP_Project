 If it wasn't a mechanical damage and one day you just discovered a crack or a few on the surface of your uke having no idea what happened, it's likely due to a lack of humidity.


If you've got a solid wood ukulele, it requires special treatment, like all solid wood instruments. Get a uke case (if you don't have one already) and a case humidifier ASAP.;
, Cover your working surface with an old newspaper or something to protect it from accidental drops of glue.
 If the crack is on the side, then you'll have to use your knees as such.
 Wipe away any dirt, oil, or whatever might have stuck to your uke during its use with a clean, slightly wet piece of cloth. Wipe again with a clean dry cloth.
 Some people use a special wood glue that is widely used for the musical instrument repairs; you can look the brands up online. Some prefer hide glue, but it's a lot of work to make it. It comes in dry crystals and you have to actually "cook" it.
 Extend it a bit further on both sides. Make sure it coats the crack well, but don't pour too much.
 All the way down the crack and back, and repeat a few times. That will allow the glue to get into the crack even if it's very small.
 Then remove the remaining glue from the surface of the instrument with a wet (and well-wringed out) piece of cloth. Make sure to wipe the uke well, because the remaining glue might leave slight traces when dried.
 Then put it in the case with a humidifier. It's usually recommended that you don't touch the glued details for 12-18 hours, so just leave it in the case.

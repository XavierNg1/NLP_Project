 While this probably isn’t a look you should do every day, it’s great for a night out or when you’re in the mood to be experimental. The liquid eyeliner comes in a rainbow of colors these days, so you have plenty of options. Bright blue has been popular on the runway, but go with what you like!








When you’re doing a statement look like this, it’s important to keep the rest of your makeup minimal. Pulling off multiple dramatic makeups looks simultaneously doesn’t typically work well (unless you’re in costume).
 Experiment with a central shade that you use to pull all of your makeup together, like red. For instance, you could use a cherry red liquid lipstick on your lips and use that same color on your cheeks as a subtle blush, similar to the way you’d use a cream blush on your cheeks. Find a matching cherry red eyeliner to create your dots. It may sound a little over the top, but others have pulled it off – you can, too!







, Liquid eyeliners in metallic shades like gold, silver and bronze have become popular in recent years, so they’re not hard to find at drugstores and beauty supply shops. Create a unique look by using them for dot eyeliner. Try creating barely perceptible pinpoints with metallic shades for a unique sparkle.

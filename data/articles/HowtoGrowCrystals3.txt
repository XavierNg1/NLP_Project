 To make rock candy, use sugar as your crystal base, rather than alum or salt. Fill a jar halfway with warm water and stir in as much sugar as you can until it dissolves.


The most common type of sugar to use is white granulated sugar, but you can experiment with brown sugar, raw sugar, and other types of sugar.
Don't use artificial sweeteners in place of sugar.
 Make your rock candy more appetizing by adding a few drops of food coloring and natural flavoring to the solution. Try these different flavor and color combinations, or create your own:


Red food coloring with cinnamon flavoring.
Yellow food coloring with lemon flavoring.
Green food coloring with spearmint flavoring.
Blue food coloring with raspberry flavoring.
 Place a few wooden chopsticks in the jar and lean their ends against the rim. If you don't have chopsticks, you can use wooden skewers or popsicle sticks.
 Since you're working with sugar, the solution may attract bugs while the crystals are forming. Cover the jars with plastic wrap to prevent bugs from getting inside.
 After one or two weeks, the sticks will be covered with pretty crystals. Remove them from the jar, let them dry, then enjoy and share them with your friends.

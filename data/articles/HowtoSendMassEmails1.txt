 This method is best for small lists of 100 emails or less. You should ensure you have some personal knowledge of each of these people so that you aren’t accused of “spamming” people with email.;
, If so, copy all the emails or select them one by one to add them to the group. If not, you can copy all the email into the “BCC,” or blind copy, line.
 If you have created a group list, type the name of the list into your “CC” line or your blind copy line. Use “CC” only if you want everyone else to see the other emails and reply to the entire list.
 If you copied the emails from Excel, it should leave one space in between and no other work will be necessary.
, Send your email to your list. You may receive a number of returned emails if you haven’t updated your email list in a while.

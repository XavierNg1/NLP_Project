 Put on some music, but make sure everybody likes it. It may be better to leave out heavily distorted songs. Dim the lights. Close the door. Add the feel to the game.;
, Sit them boy, girl, boy, girl and so on. If you run out of boys or girls leave a space open.
 Make sure you have lots of Skittles if you are going to play for a while.
 Everybody should close his/her eyes and pick a skittle randomly.
 Each person looks at his skittle and finds the person with the other skittle of the same color.
 The two people have to kiss each other and pass the skittles from one mouth to another.
 Play again until all the Skittles are gone.

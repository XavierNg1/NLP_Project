 If you have access to farm equipment, use an actual feeding trough as a manger. You can use a feeding trough made of any material, including wood, metal or plastic. Check your local farm supply stores if you don't already have access to a trough.
 If you're using a trough that has been used by animals, spray it down with soapy water and rinse it well. Let the trough dry in the sun before you decorate it.
 Drape the trough with tinsel, garlands, or other decorations to herald the coming of baby Jesus. Place hay inside the trough to create a realistic Christmas manger.

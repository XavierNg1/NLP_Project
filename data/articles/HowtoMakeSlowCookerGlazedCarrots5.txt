 Add a 19 fluid ounce (540 ml) can of pineapple tidbits with juice, ½ cup (100 g) of brown sugar, 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of balsamic vinegar, ¾ teaspoon (4 g) of salt, and 2 tablespoons (16 g) of cornstarch to a medium bowl. Stir the ingredients together until they’re fully combined., After you’ve mixed the glaze, add 2 pounds (900 g) of carrots that have been peeled and sliced into coins to a slow cooker. Next, pour the pineapple mixture over them and stir well so the carrots are fully coated.You should use a slow cooker that holds at least 2 ½ quarts (2.4 l).
 When the carrots and pineapple glaze are mixed, cover the slow cooker. Let the carrots cook on high heat for 3 to 4 hours or until they are as tender as you’d like.If you prefer, you can cook the carrots on low heat for 5 to 6 hours.
 Once the carrots are finished cooking, transfer them to a serving bowl. Spoon any sauce remaining in the slow cooker over them, and serve while they are still warm.Chopped fresh parsley makes an ideal garnish for the carrots.

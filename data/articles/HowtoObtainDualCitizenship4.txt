 If you are married to someone who holds a citizenship that you do not, then you might consider whether your spouse’s country of citizenship grants you citizenship by marriage. This process involves applying for a resident permit that you would qualify for based on your marriage. You would also need to meet any residency requirements.


If you believe that you can acquire a second citizenship through marriage, research the laws of your spouse’s country of citizenship regarding citizenship by this route. The laws about the application process and amount of time involved to obtain citizenship will vary by country.
For example, if you are married to a British citizen, you must meet certain requirements before you can apply to become a British citizen by marriage. You must be 18 years of age or older, of sound mind, of good character (e.g. you don’t have a serious criminal record), you must meet English language requirements and show knowledge of life in the UK, you must have been granted indefinite permission to stay in the UK, and you must meet a residency requirement., Note that entering into a sham or fake marriage for the sole purpose of acquiring residency and (subsequent citizenship) of your spouse’s country is considered fraud and is a serious criminal offense in most countries. Do not attempt to enter into a sham marriage for the purpose of becoming a dual citizen, as the legal consequences of this can be severe., Not all countries permit dual citizenship, and your spouse’s country of citizenship may be one that requires you to renounce your previous citizenship. If that is the case, then you cannot become a dual citizen through marriage.

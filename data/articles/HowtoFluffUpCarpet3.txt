 Grab a white washcloth or hand towel from your linen closet. Wet the towel with warm water. Lay it over the dented or flat carpet. If you need to fluff up a large area, you may need to use more than one towel or repeat the process a few times., Plug in your clothes iron and set it to the medium heat setting. Hold it a few inches above the towel and move it around in a circular motion. Do this for 30 to 60 seconds, then check the carpet.Do not put the iron directly onto the carpet or the towel as you might damage the carpet fibers.
 After heating the area, set the iron off to the side where it wonâ€™t burn anything. Remove the cloth from the area, being careful not to burn yourself. Rub the carpet with your fingers so the fibers spring back up. Apply the towel and heat it again if necessary.


For more stubborn carpet fibers, scrap the carpet with the edge of a spoon or comb it with a fork to fluff it more.
Brush the carpet afterward so it has an even look.

 Try to see things from that person's perspective. Often the angriest, most judgmental people are coming from a place of despair, fear or hurt. What has happened to this person to make him or her so worried, afraid or uncertain about their place in the world? A little compassion can help you to step aside their judgmental comments and see them for what they really are.
 However persuasive, considerate and caring you may be in pointing out your side of the story and how they could benefit from being a little more open-minded, they may simply stay stuck. And that's not your problem or burden to lug around; shrug off their bad attitude and allow yourself to keep becoming the person you really want to be, without their negative criticism in your ear.
 Make that mental effort to stop yourself and to redirect your unkind thinking to something with more empathy and compassion toward the other. Apologize if your judgmental attitude has hurt someone else. This will help others to learn that it's okay to apologize and start over too.


It requires vigilance to recognize when you are being judgmental towards others. Don't use that as an excuse to be sloppy about catching yourself doing it.

 While it is not always easy, getting rest and staying restful is important in getting over a viral infection. Your body’s immune system is trying to do the necessary work. It can’t do this successfully if you are using energy for work, school or taking care of someone else. So, stay home from work, keep children home from school and keep your activity level low and as easy as you can.
 You probably have heard the phrase “Feed a cold, starve a fever” A recent article in Scientific American agrees-- except you don’t really want to go so far as to “starve” the fever-- you just don’t want to waste the body’s energy with digestion when that energy should be used to control the infection.


Try chicken broth or chicken soup with just some rice and some vegetables. , , These fruit are also rich in vitamin C, which can help fight infections and lower fevers.
 Try either plain or flavored yogurt that contains “active cultures” of bacteria. These intestinal bacteria have been shown to be essential for a functional immune system.
 Make sure you include a good and easily digested source of protein such as scrambled eggs or chicken. For example, you can add a few pieces of meat to your chicken broth.
 Avoid foods that are heavy, fatty or oily like barbecued or fried foods. Avoid spicy foods like chicken wings, pepperoni, or sausages too. These are too hard on your system when you’re ill.
 The BRAT diet is often recommended, especially after a stomach virus. This consists of gentle and easy-to-digest foods, including:Bananas

Rice

Applesauce

Toast (whole grain).
 Zinc has been shown to reduce the length of time one has a cold. Food sources of zinc include seafood (oysters, king crab, lobster), beef, chicken (dark meat), yogurt, beans and nuts (cashews, almonds).

 If you find yourself in an atmosphere where you can take off your tie before eating, then do it. When we spill on ourselves, it is usually right down our torsos where a tie hangs. It is all too easy to spill food on your tie and leave a stain, so avoid it if you can.
 If leaning over something messy, like food, try draping your tie over your shoulder to keep it out of the way. This will keep your tie from dipping into substances that will cause stains.


Tie tacks and clips also help to hold your tie out of the way, making spills and stains a little less likely.
 Before wearing your tie, you can spray a special fabric protectant on your tie. This will give you extra protection against stains.While this won't prevent a stain completely, it will make your tie fabric more resistant against them.

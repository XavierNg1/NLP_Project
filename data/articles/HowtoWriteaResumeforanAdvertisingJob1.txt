 Look closely at the type of advertising they focus on, the companies they work for and the brands they produce. Note any similarities with your past work.;
, A resume does not need to be an exhaustive list of your past jobs, but rather, each job should directly support your claim to have enough accomplishments to be a good candidate.
 There are 3 main styles of resumes. It is best to decide which 1 will work in your benefit before starting to create your resume.


A chronological resume highlights career experience. If you have been working as an advertising professional for a long period of time, then this is your best choice. Make sure to include the employer, the location, websites, duration of employment and a list of accomplishments for each job.
A functional resume highlights skills that have been acquired through a number of educational and professional experiences. People who have recently starting advertising or who have switched jobs a number of times can group their information according to the skills that are required in the job posting. List the jobs, internships, classes or skills you gained and where you got this experience.
A combination resume uses both concepts. This type of resume is best suited to people who have acquired and fostered special skills. The sections are usually organized by experience or skills, with the jobs listed chronologically underneath each section.

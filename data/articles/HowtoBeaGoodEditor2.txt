 Make sure every word is spelled correctly. Don’t simply rely on spell-check to catch mistakes. Once you’re a good editor, most misspellings will jump out at you and you’ll be able to catch them more easily. Work at improving your spelling.


If you are editing a manuscript for British English, you’ll use different spellings than in American English. Differentiate between “colour” and “color,” for example, or “centre” versus “center.” Use consistent spelling throughout the manuscript.
If someone is mentioned in the text, verify the spelling of this person’s name.
 If you are copyediting a manuscript, be sure to pay special attention to the grammar. Balance your corrections with a respectful sense of collaboration. Suppress any inclination to act like the grammar police. You are helping the author improve his manuscript. You are not there to give him a grammar lesson or to teach him never to make a certain mistake again., As you read the writing, look for passages or instances where the information doesn’t match up. For example, you might read that a character’s hair is blond, but two chapters later, the character’s hair is black. Your job as editor is to catch these inconsistencies before the reader does.
 If the manuscript has facts that seem off, raise the question to the author. If there’s an obvious error that you know how to correct, you might be able to do that on your own. But if there are other errors that are specific to the subject at hand and you’re not sure, flag them for the author and allow him to verify.,If the manuscript is particularly sensitive, such as an investigative reporting piece on a controversial topic, you should definitely verify that the facts are correct. Work with the reporter to ensure accuracy.

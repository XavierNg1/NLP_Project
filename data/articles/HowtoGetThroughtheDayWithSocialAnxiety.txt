 Do not avoid going places or doing things because you're worried of the outcome. It's very difficult, but facing your fears one-by-one will gradually make it easier. Address each situation and see which ones are most likely to be stress provoking and which one's you're going to enjoy. Focus on what you're excited for and reach your goal.;
, Dress up in clothes that are comfortable but also boost your self esteem. Keep yourself moving so that you don't have time to over think your day.
 As you go through it, you will notice that you have something called "automatic thoughts." These are the random little thoughts that will cluster your brain such as "I'm not going to get through this." or "I need to get out of here" or "I'm not able to do this." Automatic thoughts will tend to be negative and they will affect how you're feeling. You need to challenge them with thoughts like "I can do this" and "I've survived it before and I'll survive it again" and "Am I really in danger?" Positive thinking will affect how you feel which will affect how you behave. It's all connected.
 It will make you relax to know that there are people around who are on your side.
 They will give you strategies that will help with the anxiety and they will never judge you. They are on your side.

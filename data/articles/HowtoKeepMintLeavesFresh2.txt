 Tear off 2-3 connected towels and triple them over on themselves to form a thick sheet. Run the paper towels under cold water, then wring out the excess moisture. They should be damp but not totally saturated.Quilted types of paper towels will hold up better to wetting and wrapping.
Too much moisture can cause herbs to rot quickly. For this reason, it’s important that the paper towels not be overly wet., Straighten out the paper towels and lay them flat on the countertop. Arrange the mint vertically in an even row across one-half of the paper towels. If necessary, trim the herbs to fit the width of the paper towel layer.If you need to preserve a large amount of mint, wrap a few smaller bundles individually.
 Fold the uncovered half of the paper towels over to envelop the mint. Then, roll the paper towels up from the edge with the mint inside. The mint will be pressed against the damp paper towels on all sides, which will provide vital moisture and prevent air exposure.Roll width-wise, going across the stems, rather than lengthwise from stem to leaf.
Wrap the mint loosely to keep from mashing or tearing the leaves.
 Slide the wrapped mint bundle into a plastic Ziploc bag or lidded Tupperware container. Stash the container in the refrigerator, taking it out whenever you need to add a few fresh mint leaves to an appetizer, cocktail or dessert.Mint refrigerated in a damp paper towel will retain its color, flavor and crisp texture for at least 2-3 weeks.If you don’t have a separate container to store the mint in, you can wrap the bundle in an extra layer of dry paper towels and stick it in your refrigerator’s produce crisper drawer.

 Plain vinegar is too strong to use on hair, so it's important to dilute it with water first. One-fourth cup of vinegar and one-fourth cup of water should be enough for a single hair rinse.


If your hair is quite oily, you can add an extra tablespoon of vinegar. If your hair is dry or you tend to have dandruff, add a tablespoon of water.
Curly hair and color treated or permed hair should be treated with a much more diluted solution, anywhere from 2 to 4 parts water to 1 part vinegar.
Either distilled white vinegar or apple cider vinegar work well here. Many prefer using apple cider vinegar in the shower because the smell is less intense.;
, Go ahead and wash your hair with your normal shampoo. If possible, use lukewarm or cool water. Using hot water causes hair to look dull and frizzy. Cold water will help your hair shaft lie flat and contribute to the shiny, smooth look you're after.
 Since you're using a vinegar rinse, there's no need to condition your hair after shampooing. The rinse will leave your hair soft and smooth.
 Slowly pour it over your scalp and try to distribute it evenly over the top of your head. Use your fingers to massage it into your scalp and smooth it into your hair from the roots to the tips.
 This will allow the rinse to fully soak into your hair. Use the time to complete your shower routine.
 Give it a quick rinse to remove the extra vinegar from your hair. There's no need to go overboard, since the smell of the vinegar will be gone once your hair dries.
 Either let it air dry or use a hair dryer to dry your hair. When you're finished, it will be silky and soft. The vinegar smell should be gone.
 You may love the results of your rinse so much you're tempted to repeat it every time you wash your hair. However, vinegar can dry out your hair if you use it too often. Use it just once or twice a week to remove buildup in your hair and restore shine.

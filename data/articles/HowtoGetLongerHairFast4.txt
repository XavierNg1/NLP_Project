 You don't want to go too often seeing as you're trying to grow your hair. However it's important to get the damaged bits cut off, otherwise you'll end up with long hair that feels and looks like straw.
 Do this for about 5 to 10 minutes to stimulate blood flow to the area. Increased blood flow will mean an increase in the amount of nutrients being transported there, which will increase growth. Lavender oil (pure essential oil) can be massaged on the scalp on alternate days as it is said to be very helpful for promoting hair growth.


General exercise will also increase blood flow to your head as it increases blood flow around your whole body.
Dry brushing your body is another good way to improve circulation.
 Stress can lead to hair loss as well as a decrease in the speed in which your hair grows. If you do suffer from stress, try yoga or other types of exercise to help yourself to de-stress.
 Eight hours of sleep is essential. Sleep is the main time which your body spends on growth and repair. If you don't get enough sleep then your body won't have enough time to concentrate on hair growth.

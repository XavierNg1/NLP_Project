 The first factor to consider when selecting an orthopedic dog bed is size. A bed too small will not provide your dog enough space to spread out, while a bed too large can actually make your dog feel insecure. Consult the size charts of various beds to select the right size for your dog.Here is a guide:


dog’s weight = size of bed
1-10 lbs. = 18”L x 13”W
11-25 lbs. = 24”L x 18”W
26-30 lbs. = 30”L x 20”W
41-70 lbs. = 36”L x 23”W
71-90 lbs. = 42”L x 28”W
91-110 lbs. = 48”L x 30”W
1 lb. = .45 kg; 1 in. = 2.54 cm;
, Some beds will not. A bolster is perfect for dogs who like to elevate their heads. If your dog prefers to spread out with their head flat, or allow their head to hand off the edge of their bed, select a bed without a bolster., If you have small or hairless dogs, you can keep them warm inside a “nesting” or “tented” orthopedic bed. These dog beds have warm hoods that allow dogs to burrow into a cozy cave., Some dog beds will elevated off the floor more than others. A bed that’s too high (or too low) may not work for a dog with leg problems, joint problems, or other injuries. Consider the height of various orthopedic dog beds, and select one that is right for your dog.

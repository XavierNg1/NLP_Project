 Most stainless steel dishwashers have two spray arms â€“ one beneath each rack of the dishwasher. Pull each rack out. Untwist the spray arms by loosening the central bolt that holds them in place. They generally twist off quite easily by hand.The top spray arm is usually affixed to the bottom of the top dish rack. The lower spray arm is usually affixed to the bottom of the dishwasher itself.
 Take the spray arms to your sink. Run them under warm water. Be sure to get water in the central hole and along the entire length of each spray arm., Along the top side of each spray arm is a series of small holes. When the stainless steel dishwasher is in operation, water is ejected from these holes. But over time, they might become clogged with gunk. To keep them clear, poke a toothpick through each hole to get them clean.There are usually eight to ten spray holes on each spray arm.

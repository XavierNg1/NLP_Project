 This is the most important way to make your Twitter posts interesting. Nobody likes reading the same rehashed material over and over. If you want to grow and get followers, you need to post interesting and original material.


Original posts could be your own thoughts or ideas, things you observe, or just amusing things that you think others might find amusing as well.;
, With only 140 characters available to write, be sure to take advantage of the space. Too many people post a few words at the time. The things you say may be just as funny out of context since you do not have much space to explain a whole story, but be sure to use the space you DO have available to you!

, Believe it or not, simple observations are a way to get people to relate to you. You want your followers to read your post and laugh out loud because it is a relatable experience that brings back a memory of an experience they had.


This can be anything from family, work, friends, or sometimes things people do not typically talk about.
 We all know people who join social networking sites and post just once a month. This is not going to make you popular with anyone. As a matter of fact, not being active is the number 1 way to lose followers.


Remember, nobody wants to follow someone who has nothing to say day after day!

, This last step is not for everybody, but if you know exactly how to do it, and like to do it, then you will be successful. Post things that will make people think because when you have people thinking, odds are others are going to be angry.


Controversial posts will cause sharing, discussion, fights, and so on.
It will make your tweets go around the Twitter sphere and therefore make you more interesting.
If you keep these simple steps in mind when posting on your Twitter account, you will have no problem becoming one of the most popular and interesting people on Twitter!

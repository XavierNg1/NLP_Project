, Use a heat protectant spray first to protect your locks. Straighten your hair with a flattening iron, or crimp it with a crimping iron. Alternately, add large curls to the ends only., Use a pick to create a part, and flip your hair over to one side. Wet a brush or comb with water or styling product. Place the brush at the top middle of your forehead near your hairline. Swoop the brush upwards and towards the side opposite the part. Seal the look with hairspray.Repeat the brush or comb swoop multiple times, if needed, to achieve the look you want before applying hairspray.
If desired, repeat the swoop on the hair below the part to the side of your face. Move the brush horizontally to put a bit of wave there.
Use your fingers to comb through your locks and flip them to the side throughout the day like Cher from the movie Clueless. If you donâ€™t use a firm hold hairspray, you can even tousle the flip from one side to another!

 Indirect deterrence includes types of punishment that don’t come directly from you, and work well in deterring compulsive behavior such as incessant licking. A great deterrent is smell. Fill a spray bottle with water and a bit of something your cat doesn’t enjoy to smell.There are lots of options to try. Dilute liquids or soak solids in water before lightly spraying anything you don’t want licked.
 Citrus scents may be particularly effective. Soak orange or lemon peels in water. Use peels instead of the fruit’s flesh so you’ll get the fruit’s oils without the sugar. Vinegar or the oil of lavender, lemongrass, citronella, or eucalyptus will also likely work especially well. You only need to add a small amount to a spray bottle of water for the mixture to be effective.Coffee grounds and pipe tobacco also deter cats. Soak a small amount right in the spray bottle overnight.
Make sure whatever you choose won’t discolor or otherwise damage the items you spray. Test an inconspicuous area by spraying it and checking it the next day before you spray an entire item.
Be sure to choose an aroma that won’t bother you!

, If indirect punishment isn’t working, keep in mind that there are likely better ways to address your cat’s behavior than direct punishment. Most cat’s behavior problems can be remedied by making your cat feel more safe and secure and providing them with more stimulation.While training your cat not to lick too much, simply place any blankets and stuffed animals in a drawer or closet to keep them from being licked.

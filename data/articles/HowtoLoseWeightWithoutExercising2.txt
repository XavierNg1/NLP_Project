 Monitoring your progress is important when you're losing weight. Stepping on the scale regularly can help you see how effective your diet program is going and whether or not you need to make any changes.


Remember, safe weight loss is about one to two pounds per week. Be patient with your progress. You're more likely to sustain slow and steady weight loss in the long-term.For the most accurate trend, it's best to weigh yourself at the same time of day, the same day of the week and in the same clothes (or choose to go without clothes).
If your weight loss has plateaued or you've begun to gain weight, recheck your meal plans and food journals and see if you can cut out any more excess calories to help induce weight loss.
 Having friends, family members or co-workers supporting you through your weight loss plan may help you continue to lose weight and maintain it long-term.Build a support group to help you stay on track.


See if others you know also want to lose weight. Many times people find it easier to tackle weight loss together as a group.
You can also try finding online support groups or support groups that meet in person on a weekly or monthly basis.
Get support by working with a registered dietitian; she can customize your meal plan and provide on-going support.
 Having a motivating and enticing reward at the end of your weight loss goals can help push you through to the end. Set up something exciting for yourself as you meet your goals. Ideas to try include:


Buying yourself new shoes or clothes.
Treating yourself to a round of golf or other favorite sport.
Getting a massage or other spa treatment.
Avoid food-related rewards, as these can trigger old habits that might not be conducive to weight loss.

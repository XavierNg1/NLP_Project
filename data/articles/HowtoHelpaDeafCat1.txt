 Cats are safer indoors, anyway, but once a cat loses its hearing, being outdoors is particularly dangerous. They can't hear approaching dangers, so they're more likely to run into trouble, such as a car on the road., Your cat should be tagged anyway, in case it gets outside, but tagging is especially important for deaf cats. Buy a collar and tag. On the tag, include your contact information, as well as a note about the cat's deafness.


It's also a good idea to have your cat microchipped, as collars can come off. A microchip is a small chip inserted under your cat's skin that provides your contact information when scanned.
 If you have a deaf cat, it will likely startle more easily. Help keep it calmer by alerting it to your presence. One approach is to stomp the floor so the cat can feel your vibrations before you come closer.You can also flash the ceiling lights to let your cat know you're nearby.
You don't want to just swoop in and scoop up a cat who didn't know you were coming. It will scare the cat, who may lash out.
Clap your hands for partially deaf cats. If your cat is losing its hearing but isn't completely deaf, clapping your hands nearby may be enough to get its attention., If your cat is wandering around somewhere in your home, it's obviously not going to hear you calling if you need it. Place a bell on the cat's collar so it makes noise when it walks, helping you pinpoint where it is in your home.

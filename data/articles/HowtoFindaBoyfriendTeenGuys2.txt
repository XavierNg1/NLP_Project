 Online dating has helped connect many gay teens who may not have felt comfortable coming out to their community. There is always a risk with operating romance on the internet. Some people do not represent themselves honestly online.Talk on the phone or through Skype before meeting. There are cruel people out there who will try to exploit you and your sexuality.
Be cautious and find their Facebook to see if they are who they say they are.
 There are many dating sites and apps that are specifically geared towards the LGBT community. Even sites that have high success with straight couples, like OkCupid, have a thriving community for guys looking for guys.


Some sites are notorious for hook ups (like Grindr and Tinder) and not as known for lasting relationships. If you consider a site like this, be honest in your profile.
 Again, be honest in what you're looking for in a guy. Many of these sites will ask for a series of questions that match people up based on interests. Go through this and be honest to find someone who might be compatible with you.
 Once you match with someone and agree to meet, you should offer where to meet. It's a good idea to go on a walking date for a first date. Walking through a park is good. It isn't causing you to feel claustrophobic or exposed in way a coffee shop might.

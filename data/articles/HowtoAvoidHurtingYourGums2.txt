 A soft-bristled brush is best because it's less likely to harm your gums. Harder bristles can tear and damage your gums. You can use either a manual or electric toothbrush, as long as the bristles are soft., You don't want to run the toothbrush across all your teeth in hard strokes. Rather, short, soft strokes are better. On the outer edges of your teeth, you can use small back and forth strokes, aiming to be just along the gum line but mostly on your teeth. After three or four back and forth strokes, continue brushing using vertical strokes over the teeth and the gumline. On the inside edge of your teeth, you can use small up and down strokes.Brushing too hard can leave your gums damaged and bleeding.
 Your gums are harmed by bacteria just like your teeth. Therefore, it's important to brush your teeth often to avoid hurting your gums. You should try to brush your teeth at least twice a day for two to three minutes each time.

 You can use any type of sugar except powdered sugar. Choose raw sugar, brown sugar, or plain granulated sugar.;
, Pour it over the sugar evenly and let it sit for a few seconds.
 Try to remove the clumps of sugar and make a smooth mixture. If clumps of sugar remain, continue mixing to remove them. The sugar is ready when it retains it shape when lightly pressed.
 You can use a bread pan, a loaf pan, or any type of glass or metal pan that is oven safe.
 Pack the sugar into the base of the pan very tightly with a spatula or another tool that is stiff and flat. The height should be similar to a commercial sugar cube, around 1.27cm/1/2 an inch.


If you want sugar pieces that aren't shaped like cubes, pour the sugar into oven-safe candy molds or muffin tins.
If you have candy molds that aren't oven safe, you can still use them. Pour the sugar into the molds and use a spatula to flatten the tops. Instead of putting the molds in the oven, cover them loosely with parchment paper and leave them on the counter overnight. They'll be hard by morning.
 Using a knife, cut the sugar sheet into cubes of the size you want. Try to cut neat, even squares. Do not forget this step; if you do, you will end up with a sugar block, rather than sugar cubes.
 Set a timer for 1 hour.
 After one 1 hour, take the pan out and let the sugar cubes cool for at least 10 minutes.
 Pull the sugar cubes out of the pan and break them apart with your hands or something smooth like a knife. If cut properly, they will break fairly easy.
 Put the sugar cubes into an airtight container for future use. Or, pop them into your coffee or tea right now and enjoy.

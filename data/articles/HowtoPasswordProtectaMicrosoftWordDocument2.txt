 This is the round button that is located in the top-left corner of the window. Clicking this button will open a menu that will allow you to save your document or start a new one.
 This option is located between Print and Send. A new menu will appear.
 A small box will appear where you can enter the password that you would like. You will be asked to enter the password twice to confirm it. You will not be able to retrieve this password if you forget it, so write it down in a safe location.


In order for the password to take effect, you must save the file.
 If you want to remove your password, open the document and click the Microsoft Office Button again. Hover over Prepare and select “Encrypt Document”. There will be a password in the box, delete it and press OK.

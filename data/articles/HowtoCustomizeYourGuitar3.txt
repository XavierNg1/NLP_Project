 Protect and carry around your guitar in style by getting a new hard or soft case. Or, make your own soft guitar case easily with some fabric, batting, and a sewing machine.


You can also make your own hard case if you have good woodworking skills and access to the materials necessary to cut a custom shape for your guitar.
Make sure that if you make your own case, there is no extra room inside for your guitar to rattle around and get damaged, but also doesnâ€™t get squeezed too tightly.
 Try spicing up an old case with new, unique details to display your personality and style.


On a soft case, you can sew or iron on patches, embroider patterns, or attach buttons or piping.
On a hard case, you can add stickers, paint or pen designs, or replace the clasps and other hardware with new fixtures in a different metal or color.
On any case, you can also try customizing the lining by hand-sewing or using fabric glue to attach your own fabric in a fun color or pattern to the inside of the case. Just make sure your guitar still fits well in the case with your added lining., Get yourself a new guitar strap to easily add a touch of color or pattern to the overall look of your instrument. Choose a wide, well-made strap for comfort and durability.


You can also make your own guitar strap with any piece of heavy fabric and the right fittings to attach it to your guitar. Or, simply spruce up your existing strap by wrapping new fabric around it., Get new picks that express your style or complement the look of your guitar. Find guitar or music stores that can create custom picks for you, or that make unique or unusual picks.


You can even make your own picks using a pick puncher, which cuts out the right shape from any hard plastic or other suitable material.

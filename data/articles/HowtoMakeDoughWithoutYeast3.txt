 Turn on the oven to 400 degrees F (200 C). Get out a baking sheet or pizza pan and set it aside.You won't need a loaf pan, since soda bread is shaped and baked.
 Measure all of the dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl. Whisk them together until they're completely combined. You'll need:4 cups (480 g) flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 tablespoon baking soda

, Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour 1 1/2 cup (355 ml) of water and 2 teaspoons of vinegar into the well. Use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until it forms a shaggy dough.You can use white vinegar or cider vinegar for this recipe.
 Sprinkle a little flour on your work surface and scoop the soda bread dough onto it. Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, so the dough becomes smooth and elastic.You can knead the dough however you like. The important thing is that the dough is stretched and folded repeatedly. This will develop the gluten in the flour.
 Use the palms of your hands to smooth the dough into a round disk. It should be about 1 1/2 inches (3.8 cm) high. Put the disk of dough on the baking sheet. Use a sharp knife to score an 'X' through the top of the loaf.Cut the 'X' deep into the dough, almost reaching the bottom of the dough. This will give steam a way to escape and give the soda bread its classic shape.
 Put the bread in the preheated oven and bake it for 30 to 40 minutes. The bread will become crusty and firm once it's finished baking. Carefully take the bread out of the oven and brush it with 1 tablespoon (14 g) of melted butter. This will give it extra flavor and make the crust softer.For an even softer crust, you can brush the bread with milk halfway through the baking time.

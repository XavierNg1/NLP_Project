 If you need an even arc over several heat of tubing as opposed to one bend, then a tube roller is going to produce much better results. You can find a tube roller at most hardware stores, and they’re actually going to be cheaper than pneumatic bending devices.


As with tube benders, your tube roller may come with a set of dies, so you can fit the exact size of tube you need to roll without the risk of flattening it.
 A tube roller works by placing increased force on a piece of tubing, then rolling it back and forth over the force to create an even bend. Begin by placing the tube into the roller with the appropriately sized die holding it in place.With a tube roller, you will start at one end rather than in the middle.
 Most tube rollers will have a hex head bit, so you can use a regular wrench to increase the force in the vice., For basic tube roller models, the device will simply have a large wheel attached that your turn to feed the tube through and under the applied force.Turning the wheel will require a bit of strength, especially as you increase the force on the tube in later passes.
 Once you have passed the tube from one end to the other down the roller, you should increase the force in the vice by tightening the rod by approximately another quarter of a turn., The wheel on the roller allows you to turn either direction, so with more pressure on the tube, you’ll roller it back through in the opposite direction., Continue tightening the roller by a quarter turn after each pass through the device and rolling it again. After several passes, you’ll notice the nice, even arc forming on the tube. Continue rolling until you have the angle you need.


If you have a template for the exact angle you need, you can hold it again the angle in the tube after each pass until you’ve achieved your desired result.

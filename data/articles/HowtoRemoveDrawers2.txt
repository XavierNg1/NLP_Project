 Furniture with one drawer is relatively easy to handle, but if you need to remove multiple drawers from one piece of furniture, you need to make sure that you start with the top drawer and gradually work your way down to the bottom drawer.


By working from top to bottom, you can prevent the piece from becoming too top-heavy and tipping over. If the furniture body is heavier than the loaded drawers, however, the order of removal won't make much difference.
 Extend the drawer out as far as it will go. Most drawers will naturally stop at a certain point.


Position yourself in front of the drawer and place one hand on either side of the drawer face.
Maintain some distance when you start, giving the drawer adequate room to extend outward as you pull. If necessary, step back so the drawer can pull out as far as possible.
 Continue tugging on the drawer toward your torso, pulling it out as straight and evenly as possible. The drawer should eventually come out completely, but you may need to exert considerable force before it does so.


The resistance offered by the drawer will vary based on its construction. Drawers that use a center wooden track are generally more difficult to remove than those with two side wooden tracks.
Each drawer should have a plastic "stop" piece, and this piece is responsible for preventing the drawer from falling out accidentally. The stop for center track drawers will usually be fairly rigid, making these drawers more difficult to remove. On the other hand, the stop for side track drawers is usually quite flexible, making such drawers far easier to remove.

 Obviously. Whatever you like for music, you should put it on your iPod.;
, Even if your iPod is only an 8 GB, you still can have some videos on it (unless you have it filled with other stuff). If you don't want to buy a $15 movie, or even a $2 TV Show, you can get free videos from iTunes, such as Video podcasts and most season premiers, or download YouTube videos with a downloader (real player works well) The free iWhoopie app in the App Store lets you download YouTube videos over WiFi and play them whenever you want!

, Not everyone uses photos on their iPods, but it can be fun to look at all your photos when you are bored.
 Why else would you buy an iPod Touch? In addition to the apps/widgets the iPod Touch comes with Safari Mobile, Calendar, Mail, Contacts, YouTube, Stocks, Maps, Weather, Clock, Calculator, and Notes.
 There are over 100,000 approved apps in the iTunes store (as of 11/24/09); many of them free. Some great free download-able apps include:

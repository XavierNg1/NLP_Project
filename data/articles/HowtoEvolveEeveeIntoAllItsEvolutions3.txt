 Flareon, Vaporeon, and Jolteon are all evolved from Eevee in similar ways - by using special elemental "stone" items. To evolve a Flareon, for instance, use a Fire stone on it.


Fire stones can be found at the Fuego Ironworks in Pokémon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum. They are also very common in the Underground.
Flareon is a good Pokémon if you want a high attack level. In fact, it has the highest Attack of all Fire Types, tied with Ho-Oh. It also has Flash Fire, an ability which powers up Fire moves.
 Vaporeon is evolved in the same way as Flareon, only with a Water Stone rather than a Fire Stone.


Pokémon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum: Only one Water Stone can be found on Route 213; surf is needed to get this stone. In the Underground, unlike the Fire Stone, the Water Stone is very rare and very difficult to find. You can find one water stone in Solaceon Ruins hidden in a rock.
Like many Water-Types, Vaporeon's highest stat is its HP. It also has a rather high Special Attack. Its ability is Water Absorb, which heals it when hit with Water-Type moves.
 Finally, Jolteon is evolved by using a Thunder Stone on an Eevee.


Pokémon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum: Thunder Stones can be found at Sunyshore City (where it is hidden very well) and in the Underground, where they are almost as common as Fire Stones.
Jolteon's highest stat is its extraordinary speed. Its ability is Volt Absorb, which, like Water Absorb, heals it when hit by Electric-Type moves.

 Biotin is a supplement used for a wide range of cases, from diabetes to hair growth. Biotin is also effective in treating brittle nails, making them stronger and less likely to split or break.Biotin can be found in natural foods, although it is commonly taken as a supplement.


Biotin won't necessarily make your nails grow faster or longer. Again, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that nails can be spurred to grow faster or longer by diet or lifestyle. What Biotin will do is make sure that your nails crack less often and that they are fuller. Nails that crack less often have a better chance to grow longer the natural way.
Naturally occurring Biotin absorbs into the body relatively poorly. It can, however, be found naturally in many foods:

Wheat germ
Whole-grain cereals
Whole wheat bread
Eggs, dairy products
Nuts
Swiss chard
Salmon
Chicken



, When your fingernails leave the cuticle, they are already dead cells, meaning that they won't repair themselves. This means that you have to take care of them yourself.


Every time you wash your hands, finish your sanitation regime by applying hand cream to your hands and nails. This will keep your fingernails from becoming too brittle, from cracking, or from splitting.
Wear gloves during the winter months if you go outside. Use rubber gloves if you're cleaning indoors or doing dishes, for example.
 Take a break from applying nail polish (and hence nail polish remover) to your hands every other week or every third week. You'll emerge with stronger nails.


Try looking for a polish that doesn't need to be refreshed every week. If you can't find one, try looking for a polish that can be colored over when your fancy strikes you a different way or you are tired of that color.

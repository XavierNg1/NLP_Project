 Dogs are social and need environmental stimuli to stay healthy and well-adjusted.


Take your dog for regular walks around the neighborhood.
Whenever possible, take your dog to parks or open spaces where it can run around freely.
 Dogs are pack animals and need to feel part of a family, so when you come home, bring your dog inside and allow it to socialize with you and your family.


Don’t leave your dog outside or unattended while you’re home; it will likely lead your dog to become anxious and frustrated, leading to poor behavior.
 Dogs are often confused by human inconsistency--sometimes when they bark, you yell, but at other times you don’t respond. As a result, your dog can’t tell whether barking is a good or a bad thing.


The only way to train your dog in the behavior you want is to be consistent, so it will be able to learn the behaviors you want and don’t want it to have., Teaching your dog how to respond to a “quiet” command is more productive than yelling at your dog to “be quiet” or “shut up.”


As with any behavior you want to instill in your dog, consistency is key.
Begin by teaching your dog to “speak” on command. You can do this by knocking on the door to simulate a visitor. When the dog barks, provide a treat (and remember to use the clicker if you’re clicker training). Once the dog responds regularly and looks for the treat, give this behavior a cue word, such as “speak.”
Once your dog can reliably bark on command, teach the “quiet” command. Find a quiet environment with no distractions. Tell your dog to “speak,” then say “quiet,” wait for the to stop barking, use the clicker if you’re clicker training, and reward your dog with a treat.
Repeat as necessary until your dog learns to associate the command “quiet” with stopping its barking and with being rewarded for the quiet.

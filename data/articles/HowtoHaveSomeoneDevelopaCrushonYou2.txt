 It most often happens when a guy tries to act up for a new girl he will look like a pretentious oaf. Being yourself is a much better method. Not only that, but the girls that do like you will be ones you will get on with a whole lot more, why? Because they share your real interests, not fake ones you made up to impress people. And besides, a lot of girls go for dorky guys, its very sweet.
 Not only that being good at sports can impress a girl, but it also tones up your muscles, therefore improving your body appearance, and making you look more manly.
 Everybody likes funny guys; a good sense of humor is very appreciated by most people. Even if you can't tell a joke to save your life, girls will appreciate you for trying.
 This is perhaps the most difficult thing for guys to do; some would rather bite their tongue to avoid saying something related to their feelings, than to actually say it. A girl is very pleased to find out that guys do have feelings. Showing that you can be hurt, that you care, is not an act of weakness; on the contrary, it means that you had the strength to overcome your fear of vulnerability.


On the other hand, don't go about feeling sorry for yourself. Be a man when you need to; being afraid of everything and everyone won't get you too far. When you've got problems, face them and try to solve them, instead of denying their existence.
 Everyone is equal, and this isn't the 50's. Chivalry is not the same as patronizing someone.
 Show her you are capable of intelligent conversation. Burping contests and potty humor are fun, but consider your audience. Some girls feel that stuff is immature.

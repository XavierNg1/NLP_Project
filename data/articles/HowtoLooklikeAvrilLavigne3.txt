 Avril's skin usually looks flawless, so buy some foundation and apply it evenly on your face.
 No matter which look she's rocking, Avril's famous smokey eye is consistent. Start with your eyeliner. Draw a thick line along the upper lashes with black eyeliner, then do the same thing along your lower lash line, taking it all the way into the inner and outer corners of your eye. You can also add a little "wing" or "cattail" at the edge of the eye.
 Put a grey colour all over your eyelid, and then apply black eyeshadow along your outer eyelid.


If you want to, add sparkles, like Avril does on stage.
 Use about two coats of volumizing mascara (make sure that your lashes don't clump) on both the upper and lower lashes.
 Avril Lavigne uses extremely light pink blush. Dust some blush on the apples of your cheeks.
 Because Avril always wants the focus to be on her eyes, she tones down her lip color. She usually wears light, natural colors. Do not go with anything that is too red, unless you want to look like her in the video "Hot".

 Most flags are either rectangular or square. Your flag doesn't have to be rectangular, but you should stick to simple shapes that are easy to see from a distance. For example, Nepalâ€™s flag is made of two overlapping triangles., Some of the most common flag designs are bicolors, tricolors, and quarters, or use stripes, panels, and borders. The flag can also be a solid color with a unique symbol in the center. Alternatively, you can place a rectangle in the upper left hand corner called a canton (like on the American flag) that includes a symbol.


You could design an asymmetrical flag, like the flag for Norway, where the cross is slightly off center.
 As a general rule, you should only use two to three colors in your flag design. If you use more they can be hard to distinguish. The most common colors found on flags are black, blue, green, red, white, and yellow. You can use light and dark colors to create contrast.You do not need to stick to the most popular colors. Instead, choose a color that symbolizes the place or organization your flag represents.

 Start by measuring the center of the jar’s lid; mark the center of the jar with a pen. Take a ½” high-speed drill bit and drill a hole in the center of the jar lid (make sure the hole is big enough to fit a pump from a soap dispenser).Pour liquid soap into the jar, put the lid back on and place the pump inside the hole.
You can use scissors to trim the bottom of the pump if it’s too long for the jar.
Soap dispenser pumps can be purchased online, or recycled from old soap dispensers.
 Start by measuring the length of the table you want to cover (add a couple of inches on each side so the runner has some overhang). For an 82-inch-long table, use ten 12-inch handkerchiefs.Place two handkerchiefs pattern side down and pin them together so the edges have 3/8” worth of overlap.
Stitch the handkerchiefs together.
Repeat this process until all the handkerchiefs have been attached to form one long runner.
 Cut a colorful bandana into 6 x 9 inch strips (you will get a different number of strips depending on the size of the bandana). Take each strip and fold it lengthwise into thirds, then do the same thing widthwise.Sew a button on each bandana strip, approximately 1 inch from the edge.
Cut a buttonhole using scissors on the opposite end of the strip.
Loop the bandana strip around a rolled up white napkin and button the strip to secure it in place.

 There are a variety of health benefits to your kitten if you get it spayed or neutered. These benefits, in spite of the difficulty of surgery, make getting your kitten fixed worth the discomfort it may experience.For example, spayed cats will not suffer from ovarian or uterine cancer, or uterine infections, later in life.
 Getting a kitten spayed or neutered doesn't just affect the cat. It also can have a positive impact on you and your family. For example, spaying and neutering your kitten will eliminate the chances of an accidental pregnancy, which in turn will eliminate the chances of you having to deal with a litter of additional kittens.Spayed and neutered cats are also less likely to fight. This means that in a multi-cat household, female cats that are spayed are more likely to get along and male cats are likely to be less aggressive and less territorial. For male cats, this means they are less likely to spray in your home to mark their territory.
 Stopping your kitten from reproducing in the future helps to limit the pet population overall. Fewer cats that are capable of reproduction means that fewer cats can be produced overall.Also, if you are debating whether or not to have your kitten fixed, just remember that any kittens your kitten has in the future will take homes away from cats that live in shelters and that don't have families. In many cases, these cats are even put down due to a lack of space and resources.

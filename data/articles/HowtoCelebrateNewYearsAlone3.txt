 New Year’s is a wonderful time to take on new challenges and goals. However, over 90 percent of people don’t stick to them. For more success, experts say sharing your goals with friends and family as well as carving out time for progress are key. Try deciding on your biggest goal and sharing it on social media accounts. This will increase your level of commitment and accountability.


Writing effective resolutions can be difficult, so allow yourself ample time to reflect on what changes you want to make.
If writing personal goals doesn't sound appealing, some people write resolutions for specific areas of their lives. For example, there are a lot of common home-improvement resolutions people make that still have a large impact on their lives., There are some tasks that make the year go smoothly if we take the time to complete them early on. Filling out calendars and planners with important dates, creating new budgets, and buying birthday and holiday cards to have on hand are tasks that are easy to complete and will make the coming year much more efficient.
 This is a great time to focus on tasks that require a lot of time and attention, considering a lot of people will not be around to distract you. Sifting through paperwork, home improvement projects, and even returning to abandoned hobbies are great strategies for feeling very productive and successful before the start of a new year. This can also make room in your schedule and to-do list for any new resolutions or hobbies you’re planning to commit to.

 Expect a timetable like this:


After 1 -5 years, flight engineers advance according to seniority to first officer.
After 5 -15 years, a first officer will advance to captain.
Note: In non-airline jobs, a first officer may advance to captain and, in large companies, to chief pilot or director of aviation in charge of aircraft scheduling, maintenance, and flight procedures.
 Your time with the airline will determine when you fly, if you fly on weekends, or if you'll be in the air during Christmas or other holidays.

 Editing the registry will allow you to disable the Windows Update function by providing an exception for how the software runs on your system by causing it to not run. You run the risk of causing your computer to become unstable if the registry is damaged and can be safely repaired by using a restore point. Create a restore point by clicking on Start>Run then type in “%SystemRoot%\system32\restore\rstrui.exe” then click on OK to open System Restore. Click on “Create a restore point” and click on Next. Type in a name for the restore point and click on Create. Once the restore point is created, click on Close., The Registry Editor is a program that allows you to edit your Windows Registry. The registry provides information to your system and is used to change the behavior of a program and how it works with Windows. Click on Start>Run then type in “regedit” and press ↵ Enter.
 The subkey is located in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hierarchy which is designed to contain information for both hardware and software.On the left hand side is the hierarchy of your system’s registry. Expand the following paths: “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options”, Right-click on “Image File Execution Options” then click on New>Key. A new subkey will be created and will be prompted to enter a name. Type in wupdmgr.exe then press ↵ Enter.
 Right-click on “wupdmgr.exe” then click on New>String Value. Type in “Debugger” to name the new string value. Double click on the Debugger string value to enter into the Value Data text field “ntsd --”then click on OK. Quit the registry editor. Windows Update can no longer be opened on your computer unless you revert your edits to the registry or perform a System Restore. You can still manually update Windows by downloading patches from Microsoft’s website.

 If your cat meows at night, it may be lonely or bored. Before bed, try 45 minutes of high-energy exercise such as chasing cat toys, followed by 15 minutes of cuddling or other calming, social activity.If you don't have time to play with your cat, it will be difficult to relieve its boredom. You can still try the tactics below, but it's best to find a family member or pet sitter who can give your cat regular play time.
 An interactive cat toy or food puzzle will help keep the cat occupied. You can also hide treats or toys around the house so the cat can search for them.Don't increase the total amount of food the cat gets in a 24 hour period. Any food the cat eats at night has to come out of its daytime meals.
 If the cat meows at your bedroom door all night but you don't want to share a bed, make sure the cat has the perfect place to sleep. Most cats prefer sleeping on high shelves, in a box or other nook where they can hide but still look out into the room. Add a piece of clothing you've worn recently so the bed smells like you., Many cats are happy on their own, but meowing for attention at night is a sign of loneliness. A second cat is one way to provide night time attention, but it can be difficult to predict whether the two animals will get along. If you do consider adopting a new cat, introduce it to the household slowly, starting in a separate room. This is more likely to work if your current cat has already been socialized with other felines, or if you can adopt a second cat from the same litter., Older cats may have trouble finding their way around due to deteriorating eyesight. If your cat only started to meow at night as it got older, try installing night lights to help it navigate.It's also worth taking the cat to a vet to check for other medical issues.

 Don't fear your interviewersâ€”they're probably just as nervous to give the interview as you are to be interviewed.
 Maintain eye contact and don't forget to smile. Interviews are often designed so that the interviewers could see themselves working with you. Showing that you are friendly will help them see that you'll be a good face to have around everyday.
 Show your enthusiasm and interest by staying engaged throughout the interview. Be open to answering any questions thrown your way, and don't be afraid to ask your own questions!

, In general, don't fidget, chew gum, or pick at your shirt. Don't crack inappropriate jokes or check your watch constantly.

 You can be a know-it-all at home by sharing your opinions with your siblings and your parents. You may do this at the dinner table during a family discussion or when you are alone with your siblings. Listen to what others have to say and then be willing to share your opinion honestly.Try to be friendly when you state your opinion as you do not want to get into hot water with your parents or your siblings.
For example, a sibling may say something you think is incorrect. You may say, “Actually, I think the right answer is…” or “In fact, the right answer is…”.
 As a know-it-all, you may speak up when you see things that you feel are not right at home. You may notice when chores as not done correctly or when problems at home are not handled well. You should point out these issues and not be afraid to state your case.


For example, you may notice that your sister is not doing her share of the chores. You may then say to your sister, “You are responsible for your chores” or “You need to fulfill your responsibilities.”
Be tactful when speaking up to your parents, as you do not want to seem disrespectful. Instead, use a polite tone and speak respectfully to your parents when you are being a know-it-all. For example, you may say to your parents, “I don't mean to be disrespectful but...” or “I have a few issues I would like to share.”

, Once you have shared your opinions on possible issues at home, you should work on fixing them. Part of being a know-it-all is also taking action when needed to address an issue. You should work with the person who is the source of the problem to come up with a solution.


For example, once you have acted like a know-it-all with your sister over doing her share of chores, you should work together to consider how she can get them done. Maybe she sets aside more time in her day to do the chores or she switches to doing chores that are more manageable for her.

 If you’re going to be wading deep into water, you may want to wear a bathing suit and skip the footwear all together. If you’re going shell collecting on rocky terrain, you may want to wear sneakers and comfortable clothing.


Keep in mind that sometimes your feet can be as useful as your hands when collecting shells. By digging into wet mud or sand with your toes, you may be able to find shells that are not visible above surface.
On that note, be careful so you don’t cut yourself on sharp edges.
 You’ll need a bucket to hold all of your new treasures. If you’re interested in searching in deeper waters, using a net to scoop up sand will be more effective than digging around with your hands. With a spade or shovel you can dig out shells you find deep in the ground. A filter or screen can be used to sift through sand and mud. Once you know the habitat and the shells you’ll be collecting, you can determine which tools to bring along with you.
 Nothing ruins a great day collecting shells in the outdoors like a painful, peeling sunburn. Make sure to protect yourself from the glaring sun, especially if you get distracted in your search for shells. A hat or sunglasses can also help shade you from the sun and make it easier to spot shells.
 This is considered proper etiquette among shell collectors. There are beautiful shells that are empty or have a dead creature inside, and those are yours for the taking. If there is a living creature inside a shell you’ve found, give it a chance to live. If it’s washed up, put it back in the surf.

 Your dog will learn best in an environment where it feels comfortable and stress free. If you try to train your dog’s recall in an unfamiliar or stressful environment, your dog will have a hard time paying attention to your commands.The best place to train your dog is in your own yard, since your dog is very familiar with this area and won’t feel stressed out. If you don’t have a yard, you can take your dog to a familiar park. The park should be fenced-in to keep your dog from running off. Ideally, you and your dog will be there alone.
Avoid taking your dog to a crowded park or large area while you’re trying to enhance their recall. If your dog gets far away from you before you’ve trained at that distance, they may not understand that your command still applies. And they may stop associating the command with positive things.;
, You want your dog to have its full attention on you when you’re training their recall. If there are lots of noises or other animals around, you dog will be distracted.If you have other animals, remove them from the yard before you train your dog’s recall.
Choose a time of day when traffic is low and there aren’t lots of people making noise.
 Dogs naturally get excited then they’re taken outside. To get your dog’s full attention, play with it throughout the day so that when the time comes to train it, it will not have all that pent-up energy.For instance, you could toss a ball or favored toy across the room for your dog, or play a gentle game of tug-of-war with a knotted rope toy.
If you have a yard, let your dog run around the yard and explore before starting recall training. Throw a ball or stick for them to fetch. Let your dog do whatever it wants.
After five to ten minutes, begin recall training.

, You are now ready to continue knitting with your new ball of yarn.
 When you've finished knitting, you will have a couple of yarn tails hanging along the side. To hide them it is easy to weave them in. Get a yarn needle and thread the yarn end through its eye. With the needle, weave the yarn in and out through the bumps at the side or the back of your piece.

 An impact toy is used to hit the body, usually the buttocks, in BDSM play. Impact toys can include whips, canes, and paddles. The type will depend on your partner’s comfort level. There’s a whole range of products in this line from the traditional Indiana Jones-style whip to soft paddles., While people may not immediately consider tickling to be aligned with BDSM play, a tickler can be used similarly to a paddle, but imparting ticklish discomfort rather than direct pain. It can also be used to tease your partner when you slide it across erogenous zones like the neck or nipples., Pinchers can be used to impart pain or pressure on the skin. Typically they are used on the nipples. For beginners, it’s best to set a ten-minute limit, as they cut off circulation to the nipple., Plugs and dildos are great for all kinds of sexual play, but can be especially fun in BDSM play. When buying a dildo or plug make sure they are non-toxic, and that you have lube that is safe to use with them. You can use water-based lube with all toys and condoms. Oil based lubes are no good if you’re using condoms or if your using any latex, rubber or PVC toys. Silicone lube can’t be used with silicone toys.Vibrating dildos or plugs can add extra energy to your Dominatrix play.

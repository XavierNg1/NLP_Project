 Starting a book club is easier than you may think, but it all begins with a clear intention. Setting a proper focus for your book club can help alleviate frustration and disappointment down the road (for yourself and other book club members of your group).;
,Â  You can extend invitations via phone call, an in-person conversation, email or text message. Keep in mind, the more personal the invitation, the more likely you'll get a "yes."

,,, For example, where will meetings be held? Will one person always host, or will members take turns? Are refreshments provided potluck style, or does the host supply snacks and drinks? Is alcohol allowed or encouraged or reserved for after-meeting socializing? The group should come to agreement on these issues and other logistics.
 This is by far the most collaborative part of creating a book club. Refer to the Tips section for suggestions on choosing reading selections.

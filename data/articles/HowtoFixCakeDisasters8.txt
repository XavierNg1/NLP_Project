 If this fails to work, proceed to the next suggestions.
 A cake that will not release from the pan probably has excessive sugar or sweetening in it or inadequate greasing of the pan surface. If it breaks when being removed, use it for a trifle, a smaller cake, or for baked Alaska.
 Small cakes can be made from larger but broken cake by using a round scone or cookie cutter or a tall glass pushed down into the cake and carefully moved out. A stack of these round pieces of cake can be piled up, frosted and made to look like a cute mini plate.
 Some ways around the stuck cake include:


Always line a cake pan or use non-stick or silicon pans.
Any cake recipe using honey or syrup should set off warning bells to line the pan with parchment paper.

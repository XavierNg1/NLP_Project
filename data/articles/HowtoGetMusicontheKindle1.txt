 In order to transfer music files to your Kindle, you'll need to connect it to your computer. Your Kindle uses a Micro-USB cable, which is the same cable that many Android phones use for charging.

This section covers Kindle e-readers, including the original Kindle line, Kindle Touch, and Kindle Paperwhite. If you are using a Kindle Fire or Fire HD tablet, see the next section.;
, Once you've connected the Kindle, you can open it like a USB drive on your computer:

Windows - Open the "Computer"/"My Computer" window and double-click the Kindle in the list of removable drives.
Mac - Double-click the Kindle drive that appears on your desktop when you connect it.
 Any MP3 files added to this folder can be played on your Kindle., You can start dragging and dropping MP3 files into the "music" folder. You cannot use subfolders to organize the files, and the order that they play on your Kindle is the order that they are added to the folder. Only MP3-format files can be played.Be aware that early Kindle models have very limited storage space, and you may only be able to fit an album or two of music.
 After you are finished copying music files, you can disconnect your Kindle from your computer., The MP3 player is located in the Experimental section of your Kindle apps. You can access this by going to the Kindle home screen, pressing the Menu button, and selecting "Experimental" from the list., Select "MP3 Player" or "Play music" to start listening to the tracks that you copied onto your Kindle. Make sure that your headphones are connected, as many Kindles do not have speakers.

You can pause and resume by pressing Alt+Space, and skip to the next track by pressing Alt+F.

If it's plastic or metal, give it a good wash and take it to the recycling depot. Look for the recycling number on the bin for plastics, to make sure the center can take it for recycling.
If it's metal, can you use it in the garden in some way? It could hold compost, serve as a barrier in the garden or become a worm farm container. Only reuse it in this way if it has not held toxic items.
 You never know what people might want. Be sure to hose it down first though, as a courtesy.
 Fill it with garden or shed items that you no longer want, then drop the whole lot off at the charity store or thrift store.

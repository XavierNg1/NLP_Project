 Place 8 ounces (225 g) of dry whole-wheat rotini into an electric pressure cooker. Stir in 1½ cups (354 ml) of low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth, ¾ cup (178 ml) of low-fat milk, ½ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of ground pepper.You can use any type of dried pasta noodle you like, as long as you have 8 ounces (225 g).

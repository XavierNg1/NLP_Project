 This popular trick works less and less on modern doors, but is still a useful way to get into your house with older doors, should you leave without the keys.









Laminated cards tend to work the best. You want a card that is flexible (like a gift card) and one that you don't mind getting damaged. Sometimes you can damage your credit card enough so it won't work any longer.
 Slide the long end of a credit card in between the door frame and the locking side of the door, just above where the lock enters the frame.









Angle the card downward and situate it behind the bolt of the lock. You want to make sure that the card is perpendicular to the door.
 If you're lucky, the credit card will slide in between the beveled interior side of the bolt and the frame, and you'll be able to push the bolt all the way out of the frame by dragging the card towards you. The door will then open, as long as you keep the card in place between the bolt and the hole.









Obviously, this trick will not work if the deadbolt has been set. Deadbolts don't have a beveled side. Fortunately, it's impossible to set your deadbolt from outside without your keys.

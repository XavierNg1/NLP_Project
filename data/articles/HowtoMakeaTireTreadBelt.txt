 Check out various bicycle repair and sales stores; look for tires with regular, even treads that are not too worn. Tires that have a simple tread design (for example, not a bumpy tire) will slide through belt loops more easily.;
, Look in belt stores, flea markets, or recycle an old belt that you presently own. Find belt buckles of any type and shape and color that would fit your look.
 These are sometimes called "sex bolts" and can be found at hardware stores, specialty paper stores (people use them to tie folios together), or a saddlery.
 The edges will curve too much to be useful.
 Cut from the inside side of the tire (closest to the fabric threads in the tire), as this will give a cleaner cut, as illustrated.
 Ensure that the bolt is close to the buckle when you join the ends together, this will prevent the buckle from moving sideways.


Fold the end of the belt.






Cut a small square on the folded part of the belt.






Insert the buckle.

 You might want to have a vote on the best name at your first meeting.


It's a cool idea to use the initials of the members of the club in the club's name. You could even mix up your names like John and Edward Grimes did when they decided to call themselves 'Jedward'.;
,


Try to get at least three people in.
Have your current members ask their friends if they're interested.
Why not ask people you don't usually hang out with to join the club? You'll meet new people and you'll have more fun if there are lots of people in the club.
It would be really neat to ask someone who hasn't many friends living nearby or seems lonely.



Some activity suggestions are singing and playing games.
Is your club about something specific? If your club is a dance club, for example, you could read magazines about dance, watch dance movies, try out new moves or make up new routines. Find something you all enjoy.
Choose an activity which everyone can take part in.
 Make them simple.
 Put jobs, ranks and names on them.
 If you're really enjoying your new club make some rules so that it can keep going.


Decide on a day, place and a time to meet up every week or fortnight. You could take it in turns to host the meeting in your own houses. After school on Friday or Saturday morning are good times but make sure that nobody has lessons or practises at these times.
Make rules like 'No bad language', 'Be kind' or 'If there is a meeting everyone has to be invited. Having secret meetings or only inviting some people is wrong and breaks the club ethos' (an ethos is what you believe is right).

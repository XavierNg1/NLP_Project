, Some examples of good snacks are:


Cheetos
Chips
Pizza
Cookies
Dunkaroos

, You need to stay hydrated and awake throughout the whole marathon. Drink lots of water and no more than two energy drinks per person.
 Friends are always good to game with, and it will get very sad, lonely, and messy if you do it alone.
 It isn't good to just game for the whole 24 hours, otherwise it could damage your eyesight.
 Remember to pick a day that won't interfere with anything important, such as school or work. Some good days to do marathons if you are in school are Fridays and Saturdays.
 The marathon itself may be exciting, but you need to sleep to function. You don't want to quit six hours in because you're tired.
 Don't worry. Just sit back and game. Nothing can stop you now.

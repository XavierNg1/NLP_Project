 Your dog takes his cues from your body language. So if you are a bundle of nerves, he will believe there is something to worry about. Likewise, if he is anxious and you reassure him too much, you are inadvertently confirming to him that he is right to be fretful and there is real danger.
 Being calm will also keep your dog calm. Sending encouraging signals to your dog by not addressing his anxious behavior (so as not to enforce it) and perhaps chat to other people in the waiting area to show him you are not concerned.
 That way, he will be showing good behavior that needs rewarding. Not only will this divert his attention, it will likely keep the other patients smiling and he may receive praise from them, which will further ease his anxiety.


Use treats as positive reinforcement. If he approaches the receptionist or sits and wags his tail, reward his brave behavior.
Do not use treats to simply comfort him. If he is shaking, don't give him a treat as you are inadvertently rewarding his fearful behavior.
 This gives him the message that you are not worried, so there is no need for him to be anxious. Of course this may well require some acting on your part as after all, you probably are worried about your pet's health, but do your best and don't let your anxiety show.
 Check with the receptionist to confirm if the vet is busy with another patient and you may have to wait awhile in the waiting room with an anxious dog. A short walk will keep your dog distracted and pass the time a lot quicker for him.

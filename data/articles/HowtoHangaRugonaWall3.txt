 Each of these tack strips should be cut to the length of each side of the rug. Use a tape measure to determine how long each side of the rug is, and then cut the tack strips to the appropriate length using a small handsaw or wood snips.Tack strips are generally used in carpeting. They are thin boards with sharp tacks sticking from them. Tack strips are designed to hold carpet in place.
Coat the tack strips in a clear finish or with paint and let dry. This ensures that no acid from the wooden tack strips can damage the back of the rug once it is hanging.
Tack strips can be purchased from most home improvement stores.
 Using a level to make sure the tack strip is straight, hold the strip where the top of the rug will hang and hammer in the nails along the tack strip. Repeat this process for the remaining tack strips, making sure to measure where each one should go.


If hanging a heavy rug, these nails should line up with studs behind the wall. Studs in the wall can easily be found using a stud finder.
 Lift the rug against the top tack strip and press it firmly against the strip. Use two upholstery nails to secure each corner of the rug, and then use a third nail to secure the middle. Nail through the rug and into the mounted tack strip. Hammer the upholstery nails into each edge, starting with the sides first and saving the bottom last.


The upholstery nails are both functional and decorative. They secure the rug to the tack strip and can look very fancy depending on the upholstery nails that are chosen.

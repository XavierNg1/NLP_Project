 Put the vodka, Kahlua, Baily's, cream and chocolate syrup together in a blender. Top off the blender with ice.
 Puree the mixture until it reaches the texture you like. It should resemble a chocolate milkshake when you're done.
 Drink the frozen mudslide as is, or top it off with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and more chocolate syrup.

 Do this by clicking off the tab. Experiment with the right distance. You'll notice that every tab has two lines coming from it.






By clicking and dragging these lines, you can control the direction of the path, without moving the 'tab'. You may do this as seen fit as to what you will create; the example is using a heart, so the lines will be altered into the shape of half a heart. The reason why there is only a half is that since a heart is symmetrical, this half can be duplicated and flipped to create the other half. The heart in the example has been done a little different and is asymmetrical.
 Fill with a gradient color of your choice. The example uses a normal red to dark red radial gradient.
 Adjust as needed.

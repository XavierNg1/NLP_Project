 Don't obsess with a girl's body or looks. If it's a girl you are interested in, make sure they know that you like them for who they are, not their looks.;
, Open doors; allow girls first. Little gestures leave a big impact on a girl.
 Unless you know the girl intimately, keep it respectful. Take it slow and try to read her signs. If it seems that you've gone too far, or that she doesn't like it, don't act offended or angry. Simply say "sorry" and carry on conversation.
 If it's not working out, end it respectfully. Cheating is probably the worst thing you could do to yourself. If you do it to one girl, she will make sure every other girl in the world knows about it. Do you really want that to explain to a future partner?

, Looking like a two-faced guy is like shooting yourself in the foot.
 If you guys make out or go farther DO NOT go bragging to your friends about it because its rude to her and it can make it seem like you girlfriend falls fast which is NOT fair for her!

, when you are with your friends then don't leave her out, include her in the conversation, it will make her feel happier and more included in your social life.
 Not all girls are comfortable with going fast you know, just hugs and kisses for a while, don't go too far or you will freak her out and she will most likely end things with you.
 Girls love to feel pampered, take her out rather than staying in all day every day, even if it is just to the cinema or bowling, its just nice to get out rather than stay in all the time.
 Be respectful Don't call her a slut, and don't spread lies about her.

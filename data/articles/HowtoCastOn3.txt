 You will need approximately 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of yarn for every stitch needed in the pattern, though this will vary depending on the type of yarn you are using.This is how long the tail should be once you put the yarn onto the needle.
 Hold the needle in your dominant hand. With both strands in the palm of your non-dominant hand, take your thumb and index finger in between the two strands and spread them apart. Make a loop in the length of yarn that is stretched between your thumb and finger and slide your knitting needle through the loop. tugging gently to tighten.
 The tail yarn is over the back of your thumb; the working yarn is over your index finger. When you pull the needle down, the working yarn crosses over the tail, which forms a loop of yarn around your thumb.
 The needle should be right next to your thumb. There should be a strand of yarn to either side of the needle. Once you've caught the loop on your thumb, reach the needle over to the index finger.
 Take that strand that's now on your needle, bring it down through the loop that is on your thumb.
 Try to use an upward motion, pushing down on the end of the needle so that the tip points towards the ceiling.
 The stitch is created with the yarn wrapped around your index finger. Gently tug on yarn strands to tighten the stitch.
 Make sure that both stitches are the same size and tension. You may need to tighten or loosen the yarn in order to do this.
 Each loop that goes onto the needle counts as one stitch. This includes the slipknot.

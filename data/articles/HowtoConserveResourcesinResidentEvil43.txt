 These are methods of saving ammo with the various weapons:


Handgun: Shoot for the knees or head, and go for the Melee/Knife combo.
Shotgun: Try to get more than one Ganado in your sights, aim at head level, and fire.  The results will be satisfying, and mimic the results of a Gallagher show.
Rifle: Headshots are the obvious method, but the Rifles get so powerful that body shots will suffice- and this is where it shines.  The Rifle can penetrate multiple targets (at least three, on previous play-throughs) and can thusly take out multiple foes with one shot.
TMP: The same strategies that were used for the Pistol can be used here- although you'll burn through ammo fast.
Magnum and Mine Thrower:  Don't miss.  This may seem short, but anything you hit with the magnum is a goner anyway.

 Use the instructions for vernier calipers if your tool has two scales, one sliding over the other. If your tool has one scale and a round dial instead, see the dial caliper instructions instead.


If you are using a digital caliper, the measurement should be displayed on an electronic screen, typically with the option to switch between mm (millimeters) and inches (in). Before you take the measurement, close the larger jaws completely and press the Zero, Tare or ABS button to set the closed position to a value of zero.

 Connect to your home network.
 Type "Homegroup" in the "Search Programs and Files" field.


Wait for the system to search for and find the Homegroup tool. Do not hit the "Enter" key.
 The tool is the first step in learning how to access shared folders in Windows 7. Click "Create Homegroup," then click "OK."


The system will create a homegroup password, which is a series of random letters and numbers. Click in the password field and create your own password.
Write down your password and keep it in a secure place.



Your options are pictures, music, videos, documents and printers. You can also share media with devices.
Click "Save Changes."
Close out of the Homegroup tool.



Although the Homegroup will automatically share certain files, you can turn sharing on or off on specific folders.
 Select "Share With," and click "Homegroup." Do this with every folder you wish to share.

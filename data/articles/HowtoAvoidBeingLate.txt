 You don't want to rush because that will likely make you forget something. If you have an early appointment, prepare the night before by getting your clothes ready and making sure that everything you need, such as car keys and cell phone, is ready to go.;
, You may think that it's just a few minutes, but tardiness is a habit that often gets worse, and minutes will grow. Therefore, take tardiness seriously and recognize that it is a bad habit that should not be excused.
 Take into consideration the time of day that you will be traveling, and always add enough time for travel delays and other problems that could crop up, such as finding parking or getting lost if you are heading out to an unfamiliar destination.
 By doing this, you are setting yourself up to being late. If you do have more than one meeting at a time, then make sure that you schedule enough time in between so that you can travel from one to another without rushing or risking being late.
 Not only will you be creating a stressful situation for yourself because you will be forced to follow through on the invite, but you will most likely be late and upset the person you are meeting. It's better to decline the invitation and risk disappointing the person, than risking offending them by being late.
 Better safe than sorry, and it's okay to be a little bit early. For Example, if you have to go to a wedding that starts at 5:00 and you know it takes 20 minutes to get there,leave at 4:30. You WILL get there on time!

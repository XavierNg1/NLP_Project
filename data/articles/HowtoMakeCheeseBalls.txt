 Combine the flour, melted butter, cream cheese, crème fraîche, egg, and salt into a mixer bowl. Slowly blend. Add the cheddar cheese, goats cheese, and oregano. Continue blending for another minute or so. Every now and again, scrape the sides of the blender so everything gets mixed.;
, Transfer the dough into another bowl. Cover the bowl with cling film and place the bowl in the refrigerator to harden the dough. It's easier to mold while it's firm rather than slippery.
, Take a small amount of the chilled dough and roll it into a ball. Dip each ball into a bowl of sesame seeds and place them onto a tray lined with baking or waxed paper. Continue to make balls until you have used up all the dough. Make sure that you leave enough room on the baking tray for expansion during baking.
 Place the baking tray in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes.

You can also write things like 'Thanks for providing so many gossips!' However, they appear shallow, so pair them with deeper messages.

Instead, target areas where your friend helped you. Messages like 'You always helped me when I was too clumsy and sprained my ankle. I leaned on you for two days until I started walking straight! Thanks a lot (insert name)!' are better.
 Words like 'kind', 'helpful' etc are nice, but they can be applied anywhere.

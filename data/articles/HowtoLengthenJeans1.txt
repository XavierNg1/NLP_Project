 This method is simple, but it requires some drying time. It will help restore your jeans to their original length (or close to it). It is perfect for those jeans that have shrunk in the was. Here's a list of what you will need:


Jeans
Sink, tub, or bucket
Lukewarm water
Baby shampoo
2 towels
Fan (optional);
, You will need about a cap-ful of the shampoo. The shampoo will help soften the fabric and make it easier to work with.If you can't find a sink large enough to fit your jeans, you can also use a bucket or tub.
 Gently swish the jeans around from time to time so that the soapy water gets into the fibers. If the jeans won't stay under the water, you can try weighing them down with a heavy jar.
 Don't rinse, twist, or wring the jeans.
 The towel needs to be long enough to fit your jeans. Place the jeans on top of the towel. Start rolling the jeans and the towel at the same time. You can start from either the top or the bottom. It doesn't matter which side; you are just getting the excess water out.
 Unroll the towel and take the jeans off. The jeans should still be damp, but not dripping wet.
 The towel needs to be long enough to fit your jeans.
 Start tugging from anywhere below the knee in short, little jerks. Work your way down towards the cuffs. Be sure that you tug from both sides of the pant leg (the inseam and the outer seam) so that the leg will be even at the bottom.


If you're using flare jeans, pull by where the flare starts.
 If you want, you can set a fan down next to them. This will speed up the drying process.

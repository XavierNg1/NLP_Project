 Do your best to never leave your dog unattended in a car for any amount of time during hot weather. Extreme heat in a parked car can lead to organ damage or death within as little as ten to twenty minutes.


If you see a dog kept in a parked car during extreme heat, take down the car’s make, model, and license plate. Ask nearby businesses to make an announcement to try to find its owner. If you can’t track down the owner, call the non-emergency line of the nearest police precinct or your local animal control office., During hot spells, your dog is better off inside, preferably in an air conditioned environment. Watch the humidity level in addition to the temperature. Dogs can't cool themselves as efficiently as humans, and can't keep their body temperature in check if the humidity is too high.If you do let your dog outside during hot weather, make sure it has access to shade. If your yard has no shade trees, use a doghouse or tarp to provide shade.
 Keeping your dog hydrated is key to helping it maintain its body temperature during extreme heat. Make sure it can access water at all times. Change the water in its bowl regularly to ensure it always has cool or cold water to help it avoid heatstroke., If you have a long-haired dog, keep it inside during hot weather. Take your long-haired dog to the groomer to have its coat trimmed short at the beginning of summer. If you have a bulldog or other short-snouted breed, avoid giving it too much exercise or leaving it outside during extreme heat.Short-snouted dogs can’t cool themselves as effectively as longer-snouted breeds.
 Signs of heatstroke include heavy panting, glazed eyes, rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, excessive drooling, and lack of coordination. If your dog shows signs of heatstroke, move it into the shade or air-conditioned area. Apply wet, cold towels to its head, neck, and chest, and take it to a vet or emergency pet clinic as soon as possible.

 We often see what we want to see in people, and what we see is often wrong.Instead of going with your gut or first impression of someone, really pay attention to their body language as well as their words to get a sense of who they are.


The more you get to know the person, the better you’ll become at being able to tell when something is off with them.
 If you have a bad feeling about someone, it’s okay to be careful around them, but don’t let it prevent you from being a kind person. They may be perfectly nice, but just socially awkward or perhaps from a different culture.


You don't have to become close friends or share your deepest secrets — in fact, if you have a bad feeling about them, definitely don’t do those things. Over time, you’ll get to know them better and will be better able to judge whether your intuition was right.
 Some hunches are best left unsaid for the sake of your relationships. If you do decide to test whether your hunch is correct by bringing it up with a friend/partner/colleague, choose your wording wisely.


For example, if you have a hunch that your partner thinks someone else is attractive, but there isn’t any danger of them actually acting on those feelings, it might be best to let them have their crush instead of accusing them of liking someone else and getting into a fight.As long as it’s only a passing attraction and nothing more, it’s perfectly natural.
 If you’re prone to anxiety and worry, you’re more likely to intuit when those close to you are having negative thoughts and feelings, but you’re less likely to be able to tell when they’re having positive feelings.Dwelling on the negative, and talking about those negative hunches, can sabotage your relationships.

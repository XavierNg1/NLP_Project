, Using water that is too hot can harm your skin, so be careful!

, A shower will open your pores, so exfoliate immediately after your shower for the best results. Make a mixture of sugar, honey, and lemon. Use your fingers in a circular motion to apply it. Start from your cheekbones; then move to your nose, using a downward motion on your nose. Then follow down your jawline, circling around your chin and your hairline all the way to your forehead.
 Your skin will feel really soft and you will notice a difference in pore size. Don't forget to close your pores by slowly pressing cold water on your skin.
 Use a towel or soft cloth to dry your skin, but don't rub. Instead, place the towel/cloth on your face and dab it lightly.
 If you feel your skin is dry, use aloe or any light face cream or lotion to treat it.


Put the lotion around your eyes.
 Taking care of yourself will help beautify your skin. Make sure to get your beauty sleep, and drink lots of water or green tea with antioxidants. You should drink 3-4 water bottles or 8 glasses of water and/or 2-3 cups of green tea or any tea with antioxidants per day.
 Eating less oily, salty and spicy foods will keep your skin looking clean and healthy.
 After sweating take a warm shower and take a break. Don't overdo it because you might just stress yourself out, creating pimples. Loosen up stress by massaging yourself and/or taking deep breaths to calm yourself.
, Do this every night before you go to sleep, and again when you wake up and look in the mirror. It helps you boost confidence and it really works!

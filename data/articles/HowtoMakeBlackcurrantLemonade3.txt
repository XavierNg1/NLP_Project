 Add the blackcurrants. Bring to the boil, then cook until the blackcurrants become soft.
 Tip the mixture through a sieve or strainer to remove the fruit. Keep the juice.
 Add the sugar to the blackcurrant juice. Reheat. Stir constantly until the sugar dissolves in the liquid and the mixture thickens slightly.
 Pour the blackcurrant syrup into a jar. Place the lid on or seal, leave to cool and place in the refrigerator. This serves as the base for making lemonade from.
 To make one serving, simply add equal parts blackcurrant syrup with equal parts cold water and the juice from half a lemon.

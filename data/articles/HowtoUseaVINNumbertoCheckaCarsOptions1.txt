 Most vehicles have the VIN etched or in the form of a sticker on at least two parts of the car. Look for the VIN on:


The driver’s side in the door jamb
The driver’s side dash board
Metal within the engine compartment
Parts of car that can’t be removed;
, While you should be able to find the VIN on the actual car, it might be easier to find it on the car’s paperwork. This will come in handy if you don’t physically have the car, but have some paperwork associated with it. Look on the:


Title
Registration
Repair records, If you don’t own the car yet and can’t access it, you can ask the seller of the car for the VIN. The seller will be able to find the VIN just like you could – through paperwork or by looking on the body of the car.


Make sure the seller provides you with the entire 17-digit VIN number before you commit to buying the vehicle.
The seller should happily give you the number so that you can do an independent vehicle history search. If they don’t, they may be hiding something.

 Spraying is a natural mating behavior in intact cats. The easiest solution to problem spraying is to neuter or spay your cat before 5 months of age if you haven’t already. Your cat’s urge to spray should drop off dramatically., Changes in your cat’s environment, such as a new cat or new baby, may seem small to you but they could feel upsetting for your cat. Try to address any new environmental shifts by providing slow introductions to new people and keeping your cat’s routines as close to normal as possible., If your cat’s urination problems persist despite its being neutered and your addressing environmental issues, you may want to take them to the vet. Some health problems, such as neutering complications or urinary tract infections, can cause your cat to urinate more frequently outside the litter box.Make a note of where your cat goes in the house, how often, and when your issues started so you can relate them to your veterinarian.
 Cats are naturally inclined to use a litter box, so if your cat is avoiding theirs, there may be a reason for it. Try changing the location of the litter box or the litter you use. If you have multiple cats, make sure there are enough litter boxes so that each cat has one., Certain repellent products, such as Four Paws Keep Off! and Nature’s Miracle Pet Block Repellent, can discourage your cat from spraying in the house. Test your materials for colorfastness, and then spray the repellant thoroughly on the area your cat urinates.

 Odds are she won't like a gruesome first-person shooter game, so use your best judgment on this.


Try to choose a game or game system that isn't too confusing and doesn't require short reaction time. Many non-gamers are intimidated by button combinations.
If you can, get a game that is multi-player or, optimally, co-op.
Consider your girlfriend's personality when picking out a game. Some girls may prefer the brightly colored, all-ages games like Katamari Damacy, Bust A Move, Lego Star Wars, Sims, or just about any Mario game. In general, girls go more for games that involve good characterization and dramatic plotlines. Even a modicum of these factors can make a game a lot more appealing. Persona games are great in terms of good plotlines.
Don't get games that involve things like strippers, prostitutes and sex. Unless she has a sense of humor about such things, she probably won't like it.
 Put your hands over hers and perform basic actions in the game for her to start out. Once her muscles get used to moving with yours, you can move on to having her do it herself. Be patient, she won't pick the controls up straight away.
 If you make it a good time she will enjoy it, even if she's not that into games. Crack jokes, make her laugh and focus primarily on spending time with her, not on winning the game at hand.
 When she first starts out, tell her that she will catch on, especially since she's likely to be frustrated at first. Make her feel like this is something that she can do. Let her win. Try not to show any signs of being annoyed. As she keeps playing, she will get better and may enjoy the game itself.

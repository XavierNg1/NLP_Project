 This step is critical. Per policy, you have no more than 7 days to enter the receipt for it to be deemed invalid for use.


Make sure that the receipts don't just have Walmart-only items on them. Walmart-only items will only be found at Walmart and will never be found at any other store, and thereby will never receive any returned results.;
, Let Walmart find out if the given receipt has any lower prices at competing stores. The Walmart system always tends to take a little while, so Walmart asks you to come back in 72 hours if they find lower prices on any of your items.
 This is notification saying that lower prices were found elsewhere for these items.
 This is where you'll be able to transfer the money to an eGift card.
 Even if you've just signed in recently, the app still wants you to sign in again. Tap the "Sign In" button up the top right corner of the screen and sign in with your Walmart online credentials.
,, Tap the "Get It Back" button on the green bar at the bottom of the app.


If the amount in the email doesn't equal the amount on the webpage, don't worry. You can let the amount accumulate without losing any money.
, Press the "Done" button from the top right corner to exit this screen.
 The green bar won't go away at first, but it will within 15-20 minutes.
 Either use AirPrint to print to a wirelessly networked printer or move to a regular desktop computer/laptop and print it from your computer. It'll either have a subject line saying "Your Savings Catcher Gift Card is Activated" or "Your Savings Catcher Gift Card is Reloaded" (depending on the position of the gift card to the company). This email will have a barcode that the cashier will need to scan. Make sure the printing is dark enough for the scanner to read, otherwise they'll end up having problems. Don't just have them scan the code from your phone. The barcodes are too tiny to fit all on your screen at the same time.

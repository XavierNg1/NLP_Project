 You may wish to consider keeping her as an indoor cat, to protect her from the hazard of traffic that she cannot hear.


An alternative is to build a secure outdoor run so she has some access to fresh air, but won’t have access to any streets.
 Some cat owners have had good experiences using a normal, "hearing" cat as a playmate for the deaf cat.The body language of the hearing cat provides visual clues to the deaf cat that something has just happened.


For instance, the hearing cat is aware ‘Mom has just opened the fridge door to get dinner out’ and rushes into the kitchen. The deaf cat, seeing his companion go, follows out of interest. This can work surprisingly well when one cat learns to take the lead. However, this depends on the two cats getting along, which cannot be guaranteed!

, Develop your own visual code for your cat, such as beckoning as a cue for your cat to come to you (reward her compliance with a treat) or by pointing to a certain spot to get her to go there and away from trouble. Reward positive behavior with a treat and she will quickly learn to obey.


You can also stamp on the floor to create vibrations.

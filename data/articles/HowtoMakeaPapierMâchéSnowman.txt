 Stick the foam ball onto the mouth of the bottle with the craft glue.
,, Then, apply even more glue paste into the newspaper., Continue adding layers until you're happy with the final look, allowing for drying time in between each layer., After it dries, you can apply a second layer if you wish, depending on how thickly you applied the first layer of paint.

Once the paint dries, add any decorations that you wish to use. Some suggestions are provided in the next steps.
 Paint or glue on eyes, nose and mouth. Suggestions for these include:

Marker or painted eyes; or stick on googly eyes. Or, you might use craft items such as large sequins, small buttons or beads.
An orange pipe cleaner piece glued on for a nose (if you cannot find an orange pipe cleaner, paint a white one with orange paint). If you wish to have a carrot shaped nose, bend a 6 inch pipe cleaner in half and glue on.
A red pipe cleaner shaped into a half moon for a smile; or make a drawn/painted smile.
Glue on pipe cleaners or twigs for arms.
 Some suggestions include:

Glue a row of buttons down the front of the snowman. Or, glue on a row of small pompoms.
Tie a scarf around the snowman's neck. Or glue a piece of scrap fabric around the neck to serve as a scarf.
 The papier mâché snowman is now ready for display. You don't need to remove the bottle from him, this stays tucked inside as it's not needed again anyway.

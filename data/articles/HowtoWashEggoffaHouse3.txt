 Stucco is an exterior plaster finish on some houses. You can get rid of egg stains, but it’s a little bit trickier.


Remove the stain as fast as possible because it will be harder to clean if it dries and becomes embedded in the cement.
Use a water hose, pressure washer or power sprayer. Put the pressure washer or power sprayer on a medium setting of between 2,000 and 3,000 PSI. Try using a cup of non-bleach laundry detergent in a gallon of hot water, and scrub the stain to remove it with a scrub brush, then spray with water again.
Mix a cup of non-bleach formula laundry detergent with a cup of talc, bentonite, or powdered silica into a gallon of hot water. These items are usually for sale in the local hardware or home improvement stores. Stir the concoction until it forms a thick paste known as a poultice solution.
 Once you have the poultice paste mixed, apply it liberally to the remaining egg stain.


Use a trowel to put the poultice on any remaining egg. The poultice solution should help dissolve the remaining egg stains in the stucco.
Once you are done, put plastic wrap over the poultice solution. It should completely cover it. Let it remain there for an hour.
Remove the plastic wrap. Spray the stucco with a water hose, power sprayer, or pressure washer.
 Maybe the pranksters hit your car as well as your house. Removing egg from cars is similar to removing eggs from a house.Remove the egg as quickly as you can. Use a car-wash mitt, a terry-cloth towel or a sponge. Don’t use scrubbers or anything with hard bristles or it could damage the paint on the car.
Use a mixture of soap and water. Put it in a spray bottle, and spray the car with it. Let it soften up and then wash it off with warm water.
Waxing your car frequently is a good way to protect it from the elements as well as an errant egg.

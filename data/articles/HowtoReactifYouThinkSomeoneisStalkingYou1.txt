 A stalker’s behavior makes them feel they have power over you. If you provide them with any reaction, even telling them to leave you alone, they have successfully manipulated you into getting you to respond to them. Never respond or react to them.Do not respond to any of their texts, emails, or website comments. Instead, save all of these communications for evidence.
If you see the stalker, try not to show any reaction. The stalker wants to see you react to know they have control. Do your best to present a stone-faced and calm exterior, but don’t beat yourself up if you can’t. Their behavior is not your fault.;
, If the stalker has directly or indirectly threatened to harm you, believe them. Contact law enforcement immediately and make plans to be safe.Make sure you record and report all details of the threat once you are in a safe place.
A stalker may also threaten suicide in order to manipulate you, particularly if you were previously in a relationship with them. If this happens, contact law enforcement. Do not allow yourself to be manipulated.
 If your stalker had access to your phone or computer, get new ones. The old ones may be infected with spyware or GPS tracking devices. Get a new email address and phone number.Send out an email from your new email address to your close contacts. You could say, “I’ve had to change my email address because I’m currently being harassed and stalked by my ex-husband. I ask that you please not share this address with others unless you have my permission.”
Change your passwords for all online accounts, including banking, shopping, and entertainment websites.
You may wish to keep your old email and phone/phone number active in order to collect evidence against the stalker, but have that information forwarded along to law enforcement.

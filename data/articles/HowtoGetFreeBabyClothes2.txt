 Babies come in all shapes and sizes, and they all grow at completely different paces. Some infants skip the newborn size altogether, and some outgrow their clothes faster than others. Moreover, you may receive an excessive amount of clothes in one size, only to find that your baby cannot cycle through all those clothes before outgrowing them. You might be able to exchange clothes that your baby never wore for clothes in larger sizes.


Keep tags on gifted clothes until they are used and ask gift-givers for a gift-receipt when they give you baby clothes., Resale shops specialize in buying items that are in good condition and selling them to others at lower-than-new prices. Many of these stores will give you the option of selling for either cash or store credit, and store credit is often a higher amount than you might receive in cash. You can drop your babyâ€™s old, outgrown clothes off and pick some new clothes up for free.


In recent years, several national chain shops have opened that focus their efforts on reselling children's clothes and other kids' items. Look online to find your local branches of these national chains, as well as independent shops that specialize in children's resale., Online swap communities allow you to exchange items you have for items you need. Oftentimes, you have to worry about shipping and receiving those items without a third party stepping in, but many swap communities give you the option of searching for exchanges in your local area so that you can make the swap in person. There are many swap sites specifically for baby clothing and items.


Some of the best swap sites for baby items include:

MoxieJean.com (newborn to size 8)
ThredUP.com (kids, juniors, and women)
FlipSize.com (newborn to size 8, plus kids' shoes up to size 3)
SwapMamas.com (clothing and goods)

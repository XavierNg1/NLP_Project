 There could be any number of reasons for this. For example, maybe they are tired of certain foods, are spending too much time socializing at lunch, or are being bullied in the cafeteria. The best way to get to the bottom of why your child isn’t eating all of their lunch could be to ask them.


Try saying something like this: “I’ve noticed you’re not finishing your lunch most of the time. Can you tell me why? It’s important to have a good lunch so you can have plenty of energy for the rest of your day.”, Kids may not realize how important lunch is to their daily energy and concentration. It could be helpful to talk about how eating lunch can help them get through the rest of their day. For example, let them know that foods like carbohydrates and protein provide their bodies with energy. In addition, let them know being hungry can affect their concentration and performance. Skipping lunch could cause them not to perform to the best of their abilities in school, sports, or other extracurricular activities., If you didn’t get an answer from your child about why they’re not eating lunch, you might want to set up a meeting with their school principle or lunchroom attendant to see if they can shed some light on the problem. For instance, maybe your child is too embarrassed or scared to tell you they’re being made fun of during lunch. A school employee may be able to tell you what’s going on and give you some suggestions on how to fix the situation.


If this meeting uncovers any new information, bring it up to you child so you can talk about it. Try saying, “Mrs. Smith told me you’ve been having trouble with another kid in the lunch room. I want you to know I’m here for you and would like to help you resolve the issue so you can get back to relaxing and eating your meal during lunch. Can you tell me what’s going on?”

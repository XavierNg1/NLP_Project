 The bowl or container you choose needs to be big enough to hold the pencil case. If it has dirt, leftover food, or anything else that would interfere with the pencil case, clean it out with soap and warm water.
 The water should appear clean. Cloth such as nylon, polyester, and cotton can be cleaned this way, but the water should not be hot or else it can wear out the fabric., A small amount of laundry or liquid detergent is needed. The label should state that it is suitable for washing clothes. All you need is a small amount to ensure that the water becomes soapy. Mix the soap in with a spoon or other tool until bubbles appear.
 Leaving it for approximately 15 minutes should take care of most of the stains and smells. Make sure the soapy water gets all the way through the cloth and gets inside any pouches.Alternatively, dip a soft rag into the water and then use it to scrub away any marks.
 Run it under the warm water again. Flip it and open up the pouches so that the water takes out all of the soap.
 Find a shady place to hang the case, if possible, or otherwise find a way to hold it up so the water drips off of it. Drying the case out too fast with warmth can wrinkle it or leave fabric bumps. The sun also wears out cloth and fades colors.

 If temporary methods aren't cutting it for you, you might want to research lip fillers. Due to the popularity of the pouty look, there are dozens of options available. The most famous lip fillers are Botox, but there are other options that use different chemicals to keep the lips full.


During treatments, filler is injected into the lips, causing them to plump. The effect usually lasts for several months.
Be sure to conduct plenty of research and choose a technician who is well reviewed and very experienced.
 If you're tired of lining your lips all the time, maybe permanent makeup is the right choice for you. It involves essentially tattooing the area around your lips to make them appear fuller or more colorful.


If you've given it a lot of thought and permanently pouty lips are what you want, do plenty of research to find a technician who will help you achieve the right look.
It's very difficult to remove permanent makeup, so don't go this route unless you're absolutely sure it's what you want.

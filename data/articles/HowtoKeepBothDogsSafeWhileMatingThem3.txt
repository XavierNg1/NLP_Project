 This results in the animals being “tied” together in what is known as “breeding tie” or “copulatory tie.” This is a natural part of the mating process that should not be interfered with. The animals will remain locked together for anywhere from two minutes to one hour, but the average time is closer to 20 minutes., Is it very important that you do not try to separate the dogs! Do not try to use ice to reduce swelling, or attempt to pry to dogs apart. This can be dangerous to both dogs, but especially your stud. Pulling them apart can cause severe injuries to your stud’s penis making it difficult for him to mate again., In most cases, the stud will stand calmly. The dam, however, is prone panicking and trying to get away. This can injure your stud (especially if the dam is larger), so you must get down on the floor and pet your dam and keep her calm. You know your dog best! You can pet her, brush her, offer her praise, and/or do any action or activity known to keep your dam at ease. After an average of 20 minutes (possibly up to one hour), the dogs will separate naturally.

 Elephants are wild animals and must be controlled before humans can ride them. In order to control them, elephants are put through training that breaks their spirit and makes them more compliant. Elephants are often deprived of food and sleep and are physically abused to achieve this. Elephants in captivity also die younger than elephants that remain in the wild.Asian elephants are an endangered species, and while responsible elephant tourism can help conserve these animals, elephant riding is not considered responsible tourism and does more harm than good.
If you do choose to ride elephants, take the time to find an ethical place that treats the elephants well.
 Many elephant sanctuaries will allow you to volunteer and help them take care of their elephants. Activities include planting and harvesting elephant food, developing elephant friendly tourism options, feeding elephants, bathing elephants and walking with elephants.These experiences are also very educational and will help you understand the elephant tourism industry.


Many of the elephants in these sanctuaries have been abused and are being rehabilitated.
This experience also allows you to observe elephants in their natural habitat.
The Elephant Asia Rescue and Survival Foundation (EARSAsia) maintains a list of organizations in Southeast Asia that ethically treat their elephants.

, Melt ½ cup (110g) butter, either on the stove or in the the microwave. If you are using the microwave, take the butter out and stir it every 15–30 seconds.
 Blend extra-firm, silken tofu in a blender or food processor until there are no chunks or signs of graininess. You'll probably need to add a little of the melted butter or a little water to get it to blend smoothly.Blend in pulses to avoid overheating your blender.


You'll need approximately 10 grams of solid tofu to make ½ cup (120 mL) liquid tofu.
 Stir ½ cup (120 mL) cocoa powder into the butter until it dissolves. Next, stir in 1 cup (200g) sugar until lit forms a thick mixture.
 Gradually stir in ½ cup (120 mL) pureed silken tofu, 2 tsp (10 mL) vanilla essence, and ¼ tsp (1 mL) salt. Finally, mix in ½ cup (60g) flour until the batter is homogenous.


Optionally, stir in ½ cup (120 mL) chopped nuts as well.
 Grease an 8" x 8" (20 x 20 cm) pan, or line with parchment paper. This is a thick batter, so you'll need to spoon it onto the pan instead of pouring it. Spread the batter with the back of a large spoon until it's pressed against the edges and has a smooth surface.
 Even if the brownies don't seem completely cooked, you may want to remove them at this point to prevent the surface drying out. The brownies will continue to cook for a short time after they are removed.
 It can take two or three hours before the pan cools down. The brownies may fall apart if you try to slice them while the pan is still hot. To speed up the cooling, place the pan on top of a sturdy wire rack.

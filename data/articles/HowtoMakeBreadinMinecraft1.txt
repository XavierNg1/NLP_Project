 While you can find Wheat in the game, the most sustainable way to constantly have bread is to farm your own Wheat. To do this, you'll need Seeds and Water. In the console versions of Minecraft, these are referred to as Wheat Seeds.


You can find Seeds by breaking grass or by harvesting Wheat growing in villages.
If you don't want to farm Wheat and just want to see how to make Bread, see the next section.;
, Use a Hoe to turn Grass blocks into Farmland blocks. These will allow you to plant Seeds and grow Wheat.


Farmland needs to be within four blocks of water to be considered irrigated. There are lots of creative ways to build your farm to maximize land-to-water and get the most crops. See How to Farm Crops in Minecraft for some tips.
Make sure to create your Farmland blocks outside so that the Wheat gets enough light.
 Select your Seeds from your inventory and right-click on the farmland to plant them.
 The Wheat has to proceed through eight stages before it can be harvested. Each of these stages can take anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes. Harvesting the Wheat before the last stage when it turns brown will result in just Seeds appearing.
 Once the Wheat has turned brows, you can harvest it and collect the Wheat. You'll need three Wheat for each loaf of bread you want to create.

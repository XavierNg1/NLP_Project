 Exactly. Treat skin nicely by washing with gentle face wash morning and night. At night use spot treatment creams to deal with acne. Then moisturize with a sensitive skin moisturizer.
 Then, set with powder that matches your skin tone. In a circular motion, rub blush on the apples of your cheeks and rub bronzer on your forehead; for the sun-kissed effect. Use concealer in trouble areas like acne and red spots. For the eyes: Use a liquid black or brown eyeliner. Only line top lid with eyeliner. Then apply two coats of mascara to your top row of lashes. If you want, dust an eyeshadow nearly the same color as your skin all over your lids. Swipe on lipstick. Alison's signature lip color is NARS Jungle Red, but if sometimes you want something more gentle try a shimmery pink lip gloss. (Like Burt Bees's Summer Twilight lip gloss).

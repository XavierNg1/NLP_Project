 Or, find a way to automate your job. Use technology to your advantage to do the more repetitive aspects of your job. Try things like:


Automate your e-mail to automatically respond to frequently asked emails/questions.
Create email templates to easily send the same requests or responses to many people.If you have to do the same task repeatedly, see if you can automate your job. This may be useful if you work in payment processing or accounts receivable.Use applications that automate things for you like online calendars and social media.
 If you work with a team, have employees, or manage interns, pass off your work onto them. You can break your work into smaller tasks to hide the fact you are working less.Give clear instruction and details. The clearer you are with your instruction, the fewer questions you will receive.
 Consulting for a company is a great way to give people ideas but not do any of the work. The trick here is to market yourself as someone who has advice to give, and to get paid for.


Be clear in who you are marketing to -- who do you want your clients to be?
Be sure to be confident in what you do -- you want people to pay you!

, If you have a project that you need to work on and you can set your own timetable, tell your team or your higher ups that you need a lot of time to finish it.


The trick here is that you will eventually have to do the project, but if you give yourself way more time than you know you will need, you know you can have time to do nothing., Chances are, if you work odd or flexible hours, there will be fewer people watching over your work.. If you want to not do anything or not do much at work, work shifts where a lot of people might not be around.


For example, you may try being a clerk for a store or hotel where you can take overnight hours.

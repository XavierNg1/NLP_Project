 Make a plan if it's a creative piece or have your camera ready for current events or reality video taping.


Before you want to tape yourself/something else, you will want to have a good idea. Something that people will actually look at.
Think about what the consumer wants; maybe making fun of something that happened the other day, or maybe you caught something truly amazing on tape, like an earthquake or something, or you can just inform people about a disease. The possibilities list is endless.;
, Make sure your voice isn't drowning out the subject's if you aren't self-video recording.


If you didn't shoot the footage yet, buy a video camera and work your concept you thought of before, out. If you already have the footage, Go to step 4, if not, get your camera. Read the manual, or if you already understand it, go and video tape your idea. When you are shooting the footage, make sure you are not shooting against light etc. Make sure you have enough lighting to capture clear images.
As soon as you have your footage, connect your camera with a computer, and open the tape in a program for movie editing; Windows Movie Maker is a good example for that, it's free and its on any Windows PC (if it's a legal copy), if you have Mac, there's plenty of other fish (free software) in the sea. Again, read the readme, implemented with your software package. If you want/need to adjust anything. Do it now.
 There is a 15-minute length limit for all videos.

 You may be lost, but your opponents aren't. To avoid getting double-barreled in the back, learn the maps by playing alone. You'll not only memorize layouts and weapon locales, but also find hidden shortcuts. Picture your enemy's face when you snipe him through an open skylight.;
, Strafing - or sidestepping - is the best way to avoid getting a face full of metal in a close-quarters melee. But you need to vary your moves: Try two long side-to-side jumps followed by two short ones. The pattern is hard for opponents to figure out but easy for you to remember.
 Experiment with how different munitions work and how to use them effectively. Shooting a rocket into the ground near a foe will surely kill him, but you'll need to know the blast radius. And be creative: Grenades, for example, are often more than lethal weapons - they're sometimes used to flatten walls, move objects, and usually provide a good cover for a quick shot.
 Set your controller to track faster - in fact it needs to be much faster if you are a rush pray and spray kinda guy. Initially, you'll want to puke, but you'll also be able to turn quicker than your foes. When someone attacks you, you'll be able to whip around, splatter them across a wall, and continue on your way. However if you are using a sniper/rifle and sniping from a long distance you should turn down the speed so you can focus clearly on the target and not miss them when you accidentally go way past his head.
 If your enemies can see you, they can nail you. Do your best to stay out of sight and out of mind. Be sneaky. The person who sees and shoots at the opposition first usually wins - the person who lets themselves be seen and fired at usually loses.

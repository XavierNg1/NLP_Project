 Streaming sports events online is typically not legal due to broadcasting restrictions. Because of this, you will need to find sites that exist outside of the jurisdiction of these laws and provide streams of events. Popular sites include:


MansCaveFootball
FirstRowSports
Stream2Watch
SportLemon
WiZiWiG
AllSport Live;
, Because of the shady nature of online sports streaming, there are many scams that will attempt to part you from your money or install malware on your computer. Don’t use any site that charges for streams, or that asks to install programs or toolbars.
 Most sites provide updated listings of what is currently broadcasting, and what is scheduled to broadcast later in the day. Find the match that you want to watch and click its link.
 Oftentimes, once you select a match you will be given several links to choose from. Try them one-by-one until you find one that’s working. Links are removed by authorities often, which is why these sites usually provide several to choose from.
 These sites make money off advertising, so you will need to wait for the ads to finish before you can start watching. There is typically a countdown until you can close the ad and begin watching the stream.
 Once you start the stream, you should be able to watch with relative ease. You usually can’t skip forward or rewind because it is a live stream, but you can adjust the volume or make the picture full-screen by clicking the Expand button next to the Volume.


Occasionally you may experience loading and buffering, because the servers are located overseas.
Most streaming sites recommend using Firefox or Chrome to watch videos instead of Internet Explorer.
Most of these sites exist outside of the United States, so “football” often refers to “soccer”. Check the American Football categories to find NFL games.

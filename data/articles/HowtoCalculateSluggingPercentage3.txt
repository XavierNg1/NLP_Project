 The result, On Base Plus Slugging (OPS), takes into account the most important offensive stats. Baseball statisticians don't consider this accurate, but it's a quick and easy way to compare offensive power.OPS+ is a less commonly used statistic that adjusts for the league and park. The formula for OPS+ changes each year to make 100 the league average.
 This statistic was invented for the baseball encyclopedia Total Baseball, and is rarely used elsewhere. It's a more accurate way to compare players from different years, but it might be hard to dig up the statistics you need to calculate it:Adjusted production (APRO) = (On Base Percentage / League OBP) + (Slugging Average / League SA) - 1
The League stats are the average stats for all players that year.
The stats are sometimes adjusted to factor in differences between parks as well.

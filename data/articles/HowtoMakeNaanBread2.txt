 Place into a large bowl.
 Put to one side for 15 minutes.
 Pour the activated yeast mixture in, along with the oil, yogurt and egg. Stir together to combine into a soft dough.
 Place the dough onto the surface. Using clean hands, knead the dough for about 10 minutes. It is ready when smooth and elastic to the touch.
 Cover with plastic food wrap (oiled lightly) or a clean tea towel. Set to one side in a warm place, allowing it to rise. Leave for around 45 minutes. It is ready when it has doubled in size.
 Put three heavy baking sheets or trays into the oven, to warm them.
 Flour the work surface lightly again. Place the dough onto the surface, then divide into three evenly sized balls or pieces. Cover two of the balls or pieces in lightly oiled plastic wrap and set aside while you work on the first ball or piece.
 Aim for a shape somewhat akin to a teardrop or pear. The thickness to aim for is around 5 to 8mm (1/2 to 1/3 inch), with the length approximately 25cm (10 inches) and the width approximately 13xm/5 inches wide.
 Remove the baking sheets or trays from the oven while using oven mitts. Place the naan on the hot sheet or tray, then bake for 3 to 4 minutes.
 Place until the hot grill just for a few seconds. It should brown slightly, then it's done., Cooked naans should be wrapped in a clean tea towel to keep warm.
 Spread melted butter or ghee or some favorite edible oil on the naans and serve with the main meal. Naan is always best served warm.


Naan can be torn or cut into halves or quarters for sharing.

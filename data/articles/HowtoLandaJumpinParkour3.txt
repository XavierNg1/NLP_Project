 Keep your hips steady instead of rocking them forward. Imagine youâ€™re sitting back on an invisible chair as you land., Your bent legs will continue to absorb the shock of your landing, saving your joints from injury., You always want the balls of your feet to hit the ground first. Your heels will come down after the balls of your feet land., Lean forward and touch the ground in front of you with your palms splayed. Your arms will take some of the shock of the landing, and put you in position for your next move.

 That is to say, what sort of words would you use to run a search on the topic of your paper? One way to do this is to go to your search engine of choice and type in search terms for your topic without really thinking about it.


See what you put in, and compare it to your paper. Are they words you are using throughout your paper? If so, consider using those words for your keywords.
 They can help you identify main ideas and key points. Sometimes, when you are so involved in a topic, it can be challenging to break the topic down to its most concise points.
 If you have ample space for keywords, provide words and sets of words that have the same meaning but use different words. This will help to draw more readers to your article because your keywords will cover a larger amount of searches.
 If your keywords are for research purposes, you can use larger vocabulary and discipline-specific jargon. However, if the purpose of your keywords are to get hits on websites, then you need to think shorter and snappier.


What kinds of things from your paper are more likely to get hits? For example, “cats” are very popular on the internet, so using “cats” instead of “felines” makes more sense; however, if you are using keywords in a scientific database, “felines” may make more sense.
 You can find keyword density analyzers online. Once you have pulled one up, enter your text into the text box and let the analyzer assess your paper.


The analyzer will generate one-, two-, and three-word phrases. Choose the ones that best fit your overall theme. One bonus to this approach is that you know you are using words that are actually from your paper.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit.
Clean the giblets out and rinse the bird, inside and out, under cool water. Pat it dry.
Brush butter or olive oil all over the bird and cover with your favorite seasonings. Include the inside of the bird and under the skin as well, if desired.
Pour water or broth into the bottom of the roasting pan and place rack inside. Do not let the liquid come up over the rack.
Put ingredients such as vegetables, fruit or herbs into the liquid for additional flavor.
Place the turkey onto the rack, breast side up.
Cook the turkey uncovered in the oven at 500 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 to 20 minutes.
Reduce the heat to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius). This is the lowest oven temperature that is safe for cooking turkey. Cook for about 20 minutes per pound for a frozen turkey, and 10 - 15 minutes per pound for a fresh turkey. The turkey is done when the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit, which is quite a bit lower than many people realize. It is important not to overcook the bird since the white meat becomes dry when overcooked. The internal temperature will almost certainly rise at least 5 degrees while the turkey is resting, so you can remove the turkey from the oven when the internal temperature is 160.
Let the roasted turkey rest for 20 to 30 minutes before carving.

 This seems like an obvious first step, but sometimes it's easier said than done. If they've played Sims 1, they might be thinking, "Oh no! That game is boring and has no point." It's your job to convince them how great and different Sims 2 is using your own enthusiasm and knowledge of the game.;
, Sometimes, YOU are a better teacher than the game's tutorial. Many people taught themselves from the beginning! Decide whether your friend would benefit more from the tutorial or your teaching.
 Go through every single button and show them what it does. How do you change their eye shape? Where do you list their Turn-Ons? Tell them about using an adult face for a teen as well as different skin tones. Show them how to make their Sims glamorous!

, For beginners, nothing is worse than realizing that they are out of money when all they've finished in their house is the kitchen. Teach them to buy the cheap things. Maybe to start them off, you should give them the money cheats. Then, they can go solo when they become more comfortable with the game.
 For a lot of players, building a house is the best part of the game. You don't want to deny the potential Sim lover the chance! Just like the Create-A-Family step, go through all the buttons and demonstrate how to raise ground levels, press Shift to fill an entire room with paint or floors, and put in a roof. Remember, the more they know, the better chance that something will catch their interest.
 It's no fun when someone plays it for you, but be sure to remind them how to do work out, eat, sleep, and what to buy to build certain skills. Tell them how to get a job and make money. Teach them how to get promoted and make relationships.
 Move on to your next pupil and spread the 'Sims 2 Fever' to everyone.

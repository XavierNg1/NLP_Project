 Different colors tell people what your personality is, like if you choose a bright red, then people would think you were bold and the centre of attention. If you choose black, sophisticated; blue, confident; pink, fun; purple, bubbly. It's all about what image or mood you want to show. It's also about what color you look flattering in. Some girls look better in blue, some in red. For example, girls with long brown hair and brown eyes might do well to avoid the color yellow. It really depends on your hair color, figure, eye color, face shape, mouth size, and eye size.


Look for special colors. Black and white are classic chromatic options when it comes to special occasions outfits. The first is elegant and mysterious, the latter is romantic and pure.
A red prom dress is perfect if you are looking for a sensual and passionate look, while gold and silver are always a good idea when it comes to party outfits.
Bright prom dresses are modern and eye-catching, but choose only one bright color if you donâ€™t want to end up looking like a clown. Or you can always pair a bright purse, jewelry or pair of shoes with a neutral or pastel shade dress.

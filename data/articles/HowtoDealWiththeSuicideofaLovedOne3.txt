 Educating yourself, your loved ones, and others around you can help you to make better sense of why your loved one chose to take his life. Each year in America, more than 40,000 people take their own lives. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, and the second leading cause for young people ages 10 to 24.Doing some research about the why's behind suicide can help you to better understand what your loved one was going through, and maybe even save lives in the future.
 Quite different from other causes of death, suicide often leaves survivors feeling isolated. The stigma built up around suicide makes survivors unlikely to talk about what they're going through with others, and you may even want to keep quiet about the details of the death to avoid this stigma.Talk to your friends and loved ones about your thoughts and feelings is essential to the healing process. Be courageous and seek out others with whom you can share your story.
You don't have to tell everyone in your local community, but open up to a few individuals you can count on for support. Staying silent about this issue could prevent others from learning about the signs and possibly saving a life.
 Getting support from other survivors, people who are also dealing with the loss of a loved one to suicide, can help you find comfort and overcome stigma.


You can join a group facilitated by a counselor or a layperson who has personal experience dealing with grief after a suicide.

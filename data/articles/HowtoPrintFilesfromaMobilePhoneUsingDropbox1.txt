If you're on the Dropbox website, you'll first download files by clicking the box on the left side of each item's bar to select your files and then clicking Download on the right side of the page, then view those files by double-clicking the downloaded folder on your computer's desktop or in your computer's "Downloads" folder.

If you downloaded files from the Dropbox website on a PC, you'll first need to drag your selected files out of the downloaded folder since the folder's compression won't allow you to print them from within it.
 Doing this will bring up your computer's "Print" window, wherein you can select a printer and then proceed with printing your documents.

If you don't see this option, try two-finger clicking (or right-clicking) a different selected file.
 In the "Printer" box, you should see the name of a printer to which your computer is connected. You can click this box to view all available printers and, if necessary, select a new one.

If you need to attach your computer to your printer manually via cable, first do so.

For example, if you want to print your files double-sided, check the appropriate box.
 You'll see this option at the bottom of the page. Your Dropbox files should begin printing in your desired format.

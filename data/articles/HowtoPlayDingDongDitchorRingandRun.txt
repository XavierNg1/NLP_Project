 Do some stretches, jog on the spot, drink some water, wear light, comfy, but not too bright clothing. Get ready to run!;
, Choose wisely, though. It can help you if you choose a ditch-worthy house. Some features to look for are windows that aren't low, bushes, easy access to the backyard, and anything you may find helpful. However, make sure the home you choose doesn't have low windows (especially near the door), a dog outside, no trees or bushes, and anything else you may think is hazardous. Try to play this game at night. During the day, it is pointless for two reasons. One, the point of the game is to get someone mad, and it won't be too bad for the person at the house if they just answer the door and no one is there; it will be just a slight annoyance, unlike when you do it at night when you wake someone up. Two, it is easier because it would be harder to see you at night.
 If you are caught, remember that if the person doesn't know you, don't talk to them, just run. If playing by yourself, ring the doorbell a few times and run. If playing with one friend, one of you rings the doorbell, one knocks. If playing with more than one friend making a group of three or more people, one person rings the bell and everyone else knocks on the door. A good plan is "I wanted to ask you something, but I forgot so I don't want to take up your time" and smile.

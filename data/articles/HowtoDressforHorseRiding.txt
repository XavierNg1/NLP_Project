 Dress in sensible shoes (not trainers), and comfortable trousers (leggings or tight fitting jogging bottoms are best.) Don't worry about a hat, most riding schools will let you borrow one for your first lesson, but you will need to buy your own.;
, Hats come in different shoes and sizes, so you will need to ask a person to fit one for you. The person will measure across your head, and then find a hat to fit your head type. Don't be tricked into buying a cheaper one, as these will have less safety kite marks and standards than expensive ones. Make sure you wear your hat at all times when on a horse, as they will keep your head safe!

, The next most important thing are boots. These are easy to fit as they are your shoe size. You can buy long boots (which tend to be more expensive) or short boots and half chaps. Half chaps will protect your leg from pinching from the stirrup leather. You can buy boots which are steel toe capped, which protect your toes from your horse's feet!

, These come in a variety of colours, but cream is traditional. These will either come in dress sizes (e.g: 6, 8) or sizes in inches. To find out your jodhpur size, you need to measure you waist with a tape measure. You can also buy breeches, which are best for long boots, as they don't create a bulge inside your boots.
 Most saddlers will have them, and will fit them for you. However, body protectors do cost a lot, so you don't really need one until you start jumping.
 Special riding gloves will protect your hands from chafing and being pulled through the reins or a lead rope. You can get cotton ones or leather ones, and they vary in price. They all have reinforced pads where the reins sit in between your fingers. They usually come in x-small, small, medium, large and x-large.

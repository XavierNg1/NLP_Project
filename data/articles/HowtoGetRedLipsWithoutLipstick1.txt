 Look for a bright red shade that you like. Cherry, cranberry or strawberry-flavored powder will result in a pretty red stain., Any bowl or cup works just fine.
 Just add a few drops at a time. Stir in the water until you have a thick, spreadable paste.
 Dip a cotton swab in the paste and apply it neatly to your lips, making sure to stay within your lip lines.
 This will give it time to stain your lips. When three minutes are up, rinse the paste away and check out your new lip stain.
 Repeat the process as many times as you'd like until your lips are stained just the right bright red color.
 This will keep your color in place for several hours and make your lips look bright and shiny.

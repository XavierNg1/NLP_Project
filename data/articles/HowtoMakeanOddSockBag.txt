 If it looks ratty you can dye it, or decorate it with paint markers. If you are really crafty you can embroidery a saying like “Odd Sock’ bag on it (that is what ours said).;
, You can stitch this under and into itself (so it makes a hole in both ends) by hand (it might be a little hard by machine). If your pillow doesn’t have a folded over edge you will have to make one, see step 3.



Cut a slit 6 inches (15.2 cm) long down the seam but not on the seam.






Fold over the edges of this slit (this is still on the side of the pillow) about 1/4-1/2 inches, towards the inside of the pillowcase and stitch down.






Put a little row of stitches across the place where the slit ends so it doesn’t run. If you want to roll the edge over once to really finish it feel free but this is only a sock bag.






Fold down the end of the pillowcase 3 inches (7.6 cm), again towards the inside of the pillowcase, pin into place and stitch all the way around. You should now have a folded over edge with two holes on the same side.
, Feed the safety pin (or just the knot) through the top seam, it is pretty big seam so it should be easy.
 You can hang it on the back of your door and when you have an odd sock put it in there. When you do laundry the next week its mate will more than likely magically appear.

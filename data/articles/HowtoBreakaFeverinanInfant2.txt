 Never use cold water, ice baths, or rubbing alcohol. A fever must be brought down gradually, and these methods will reduce body temperature too rapidly and may cause additional health problems. Moreover, rubbing alcohol comes with the additional risk of alcohol poisoning, which may occur if the alcohol is absorbed through the skin. , Make sure your baby is dressed in lightweight fabrics, and keep layers to a minimum. Extra layers will likely trap the excess body heat produced by your baby's fever, causing your baby to stay too warm and encouraging the fever to continue rising. If your baby starts to shiver, however, you may need to add an extra layer to prevent him or her from catching a chill.
 A little dampness may not cause much damage, but a thoroughly drenched garment may cause your baby to catch a chill, which will only complicate your child's illness.
 Shivering is a tell-tale sign that your child needs additional coverage to stay warm. Blankets make a good choice because they are easier to remove and adjust than clothing. Never use heavy-weight blankets, however, since these will only cause your infant's body temperature to increase.
 It is a good sign if your child is still interested in playing, but too much physical activity will only cause the bodyâ€™s internal temperature to continue climbing. Keep your baby indoors and relatively sedate.
 Preventing dehydration is an important part of fighting a fever. Infants under six months of age should only receive breast milk or formula, but you may consider supplementing this with small amounts of water, natural fruit juice, or gelatin and popsicles made with natural fruit juice to babies over six months.

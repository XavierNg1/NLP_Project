 Brush or comb your hair to remove any tangles that may make creating your bun difficult, and prevent it from looking smooth.









Ballet buns look best with clean, slightly damp hair.
 Tie up your hair with an elastic hair tie that matches your hair color, if possible. Try to use a smaller elastic hair tie, as this will have a tighter, more secure hold on your hair.


You can create the ponytail anywhere on your head, although ballerina buns tend to be at the crown of the head either right on top, or slightly tilted toward the back of the head.
Ballerina buns look best with hair lengths that are medium to long. Thatâ€™s because ballerina buns require wrapping your hair around itself, and with longer hair, the wrapping can be more uniform.
 Twist your hair, mimicking the movement of a tornado, until you are unable to twist your hair any tighter. Keep twisting, following the natural movement of the twist, and begin to wrap the twisted hair around the base of your ponytail. Once you get to the ends of your hair, bobby pin your ends under the rest of the bun, or use another elastic hair tie to hold all of your hair together.









If you have very thick hair, you can try braiding your hair after you make the ponytail, to make the twisting of your hair more manageable.
 If you want a sleek bun, you can spray hairspray onto your hair and use a comb to smooth out any flyaway hairs.









You can also use a hair or bun net to keep any shorter bits from falling out of the twisted bun.

 The best way to stay safe while traveling alone is by trusting your instincts. If you find yourself in a situation and you feel uncomfortable, you should try to remove yourself immediately from that environment. For example, maybe you find the hostel owner overly pushy or intrusive. Trust your instincts and find other accommodations. Although you may have to spend a bit more money, it is better to be safe., When traveling by yourself, you do not have a friend to look out for you. As a result, you will need to pay particular attention to your surroundings at all times. Keep your belongings close to you while traveling and never leave them unattended. Avoid looking at your phone while traveling through public spaces. Instead, you should look up periodically to assess your surroundings.
 Do not carry all of your money around with you. Instead, you should separate your cash into different bags. That way if something gets stolen, you will not lose all of your money at once. You should also always carry your passport with you, or place it in a locked safe.


Take photocopies of your passport and any other important travel documents. That way you will have a backup copy available if anything should happen.

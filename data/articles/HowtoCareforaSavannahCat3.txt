 Savannah cats love to jump and they can jump very high. Therefore, place two to three trees and perches around the house to provide it with enough vertical space.Additionally, place scratching posts, like rope posts, around your house to prevent your cat from sharpening its nails on your furniture.
 Savannah cats are very intelligent. To keep their mind stimulated, try teaching them how to fetch, come, sit, spin, and shake. For the best results, use a clicker to train your cat.Teach your cat tricks in 10 to 15 minute sessions, and only teach it one trick at a time.
When training your cat, use reward-based techniques. Do not train your cat by punishing it for not performing a task correctly.
 Interactive toys like food puzzles are a great way to keep your cat physically and mentally stimulated. Also provide a variety of toys. However, make sure they are safe and very sturdy since Savannah cats like to chew.Some great choices for toys are Nyla bones or DuPont nylon products, stuffed toys that are designed for heavy chewing, tennis balls, paper bags, cardboard boxes, and crumpled paper.
Do not give your cat plastic bags, feathered toys, toys that have cords/strings/ribbons, small foam balls, or soft plush toys that contain small pieces that can be easily chewed off and ingested.
Make sure to remove and throw away any damaged toys.

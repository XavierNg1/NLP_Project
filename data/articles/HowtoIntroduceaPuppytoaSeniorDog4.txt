 Training your puppy is the best way to manage its behavior while it interacts with your senior dog. When your puppy is at least 12-16 weeks old, use the correction and reward method to teach it the five basic commands: "Sit”,"Stay", "Lay down”, ”Heel”, and "Come here”. Visit the American Kennel Club website at http://www.akc.org/content/dog-training/articles/teach-your-puppy-these-5-basic-commands/ to find instructions and videos on how to start this training.


Correction should never involve yelling or violence, but simply speaking firmly and clearly to your puppy.
 Crate training can be used to condition your puppy's behavior, to help with house training, to keep it from clashing with your senior dog while it adjusts to your home, and to offer it a safe place of its own. Introduce the crate to your puppy casually by leaving it open and unlocked, with toys and treats inside. Gradually work up to closing the door and leaving your puppy alone in the crate, rewarding it with praise and treats.Maintain happy associations with the crate throughout the training period as well as afterwards, when the crate can be kept as a “den” for your dog.
 To keep your puppy’s behavior from getting too restless or energetic around your senior dog, make sure it gets ample exercise at other times. Twice a day, your puppy should be doing 5 minutes of low-impact exercise for every month of age (for example, a four month old dog will need 20 minutes of exercise, two times a day). Low impact exercise may include short walks and chasing a ball in the backyard.

 Commas can be used to connect two simple sentences and a coordinating conjunction (but, and, nor, or so, for example), while a semicolon cannot.Example of correct usage: "I love my cat, but he drives me crazy."
Example of incorrect usage: "I love my cat; but he drives me crazy."

, A comma can never be used to separate two independent clauses (complete sentences). This is called a comma splice and should be avoided at all times.


Example of correct usage: "My kitty is cute; he loves to cuddle."
Example of incorrect usage: "My kitty is cute, he loves to cuddle."

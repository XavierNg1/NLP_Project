 When you review your findings you need to pinpoint which factors have the largest negative impact on the overall customer experience. Identify what problems are most likely to result in them not returning to your business or advising others against going there.Once you have identified the most significant factors, these should be the first things you seek to address in your customer satisfaction improvement plan.
Communicate these results to all of your colleagues to ensure that everyone understands the areas that need to be improved upon.
 Once you have identified and acted on the most pressing issues that are holding back your business, you need to continue to evaluate and develop your service. Test the effectiveness of the changes you have made continuously with feedback and analysis.


You will be able to tailor your research to focus in on the key changes you have made, and evaluate their impact.
If you have used quantitative methods to identify problem areas, you will be able to gain a clearer understanding of these problems with some targeted qualitative research., You may have been able to produce accurate, thorough and helpful information through your own in-house evaluations, but you might consider bringing in a customer satisfaction company to help. If you want to broaden or deepen your research, you may require those with particular skills to conduct more thorough focus groups, or help you analyse large data sets.


If you want to develop an ongoing strategy of customer satisfaction measuring, it can be economic and efficient to employ an outside firm to do this work.
For example, you are unlikely to have a call centre in-house. There are a large number of firms that specialise in this work.
Consider what's appropriate for your business, and if you do go for an outside specialist, be sure to employ somebody with knowledge and experience of your sector.

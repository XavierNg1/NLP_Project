 A food with a high protein and moisture content can result in a healthier coat for your dog and may lessen shedding. If you use dry dog food, look for brands that list meat (chicken or beef, usually) as the primary ingredient. This will ensure that the food has a substantial amount of protein, which promotes hair health. If you use wet dog food, the high water content will benefit your dog's coat by keeping their hair follicles hydrated.Some anti-shed dog foods also add in various types of omega-3 fatty acids as a way to enrich your dog's coat and lessen shedding. These dog brands are often categorized as "premium" by veterinarians and may cost a bit more.
 This is a cheap and easy way to add nutrients to your dog’s diet. Simply spoon olive oil directly onto your dog’s food prior to serving. You should go by the rule of 1 teaspoon of oil for every 15 pounds of weight. You can also use vegetable oil, but it will give your dog the extra moisture without the fatty benefits of olive oil.If your dog has a sensitive stomach, consult with a veterinarian prior to adding oil to your dog's diet.
 If your vet determines that your dog’s shedding is not serious, but can be addressed, ask them about giving your dog supplements. Some supplements on the market contain vitamins (D-3) or oils (flaxseed). Some are flavored or chewable to appeal to finicky dogs.Make sure to follow your vet's instructions regarding supplement use. Too many supplements can actually harm your dog’s health instead of helping it.

 Measure ¾ cup (134 g) of red Bhutanese rice, 1 ½ cups (360 ml) of water, and ¼ teaspoon of salt into a medium-sized saucepan. Turn the heat on to high and bring the mixture to a boil.You can use any type of red rice, but Bhutanese might be the easiest to find.;
, Turn the heat down to medium-low and put the lid on the pot. Let the pudding boil lightly for 30 minutes. You'll want to simmer the red rice pudding until all of the water is absorbed and the red rice becomes very soft.You may need to adjust the heat so it simmers. If the pudding stops simmering, turn up the heat a little.
 Stir in 1 cup (240 ml) of milk or rice beverage, 1 cup (240 ml) of unsweetened low-fat coconut milk, the seeds from 1 split vanilla bean or 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and ½ cup (100 g) of raw brown sugar. The sugar should start to dissolve as you stir it into the pudding.You can use full-fat coconut milk. The pudding will just be richer. Avoid using coconut cream, which doesn't have enough liquid in it for the pudding.
 Continue to simmer the pudding on low heat. Keep the lid off of the pot and stir it frequently to prevent the pudding from sticking to the pan. Simmer the pudding for another 10 to 20 minutes. The pudding should look creamy and thick.If you want to add additional flavor, you can stir in ½ teaspoon of rose water at this point.
 Turn off the heat and transfer the pudding to a serving bowl. Let it cool slightly before you serve it. You can also chill it before you serve it. Just cover the bowl and refrigerate it for 2 hours. Consider serving the pudding with sliced, fresh mango.You can also transfer the pudding into individual serving dishes. This will help them cool faster.

It is also not usually treated with antivirals., Your body will be weak and more susceptible to invasion from bacteria. Mono sometimes comes with strep or infections of the sinus or tonsils. Watch out for these and go to your doctor for antibiotics if you suspect you are getting a secondary infection., These can relieve some symptoms, such as severe swelling of your throat and tonsils. They don't do anything to treat the virus itself, however., If you experience a sharp, sudden pain in the left side of your upper abdomen, especially during physical activity, you should get to a hospital immediately.

 Stir in a small spoonful of baking soda into hot water until it dissolves. This mixture can be used to clean all common types of dog collars.


Always remove the collar from the dog before cleaning.;
, Dip a toothbrush into the mixture and scrub the collar.
 Hold the collar under running water to remove the cleaning mixture.
 Either place on a towel to dry, or hang the collar away from direct sunlight. The collar should be nice and clean again now.


If the collar is leather, do not dry near a strong heat source or in direct sunlight, as this may cause the leather to crack.

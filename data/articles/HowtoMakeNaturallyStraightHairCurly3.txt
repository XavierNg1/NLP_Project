 You can buy them at any local beauty supply store, online, or even at a local pharmacy like Rite Aid or CVS. They shouldn’t cost more then ten dollars and they will definitely do the trick. Keep in mind that sponge curlers will give a slightly more retro style curl. , Sponge curlers stay in your hair the whole night and need a long period of time to work. This isn’t something that you want to do in the morning or if you have any appointments to go to.
 You don’t want your hair to be soaking wet but if you time it correctly curling works best with damp hair. It is easier to maneuver and the curls will be stronger in the morning. Take a shower, dry your hair with a towel, and then wait one and a half hours.
 Start at the top of your head and work your way down. You can take whatever sized sections you want, just roll it around the sponge curler so it is tightened to your head. Begin at the crown of your head and work your way down to create a vertical line of rollers down the middle of your head. Once you have this base you can continue to repeat the process at the sides of your hair and the back. 







, Once you have the sponge curlers set up all throughout your hair you can go to bed. The great thing about sponge curlers is that they are soft enough to sleep on. Sleeping with curlers in is the best way to make your hair really curly if that’s what you’re looking for. Make sure that you sleep the whole night through, don’t try this during a few hour nap or the results will be diminished.
 Do this for about a minute before unrolling. Curlers will make your hair really curly; so beware. This is not the way to get gentle waves!

 This is the place near the top where the strings connect to the pegs.;
, It should be between your shoulder and chin. Your viola should touch your left collarbone.
 Ensure that the viola does not fall too far forward or too far back.


Practice moving your viola next to your collarbone. Gently push the viola into the space between your shoulder and head. Repeat these movements.
 The chin rest is a round shaped pad that will be found either on the right side or the middle of your viola. Lean the left side of your jaw onto it. Ensure that the viola is comfortably between your chin and left shoulder/collar bone.
 You should keep your viola at 45 degree angle. Do this so that the instrumentâ€™s strings are accessible at all times. For a good measure, figure out if the slope of your viola is parallel with the ground. If the instrument is too low, you will have to move your hands further to reach it.
 Your body should be supporting it. The neck of your viola should rest in the gap between your left thumb and index finger. This position will allow your fingers to move easily and hover over the strings comfortably.


The string closest to your fingers should be your A string (highest pitched string).
The one closest to your thumb should be the C string (lowest pitched string).

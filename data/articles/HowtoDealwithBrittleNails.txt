 The more you bite your nails, the more they will grow unevenly which makes them vulnerable to break easily. Old habits die hard, but one good habit can give you more benefit than ever.
 It is highly necessary that you have a clean dirt-free nail bed. A dirty nail bed always stop the growth of nails and also makes the natural nail colour look dull.


Moreover, no one likes to see fingernails with the last night's dinner you had under your nailbed. It's unimaginably gross!

, Itching your hair scalp is one of the most unhealthy reasons that nail growth reduces. Itch less and clean your nail bed.
 The way our skin glows through regulated blood circulation, the very same happen with nails.  Try to massage with a nail cream or any other oily lotion would do before going to bed. It increase the blood circulation and thus, the nails grow faster.
 Nail polish is today's style factor. We tend to match our nail colour with our outfit's shade. Nail polish will definitely leave the stain and it will last forever. Use polish occasionally. If you must put it on everyday, base-coat is a must! Choose the best quality of nail polish so that the chemicals do not weaken your nails.
 If it's shaped in the correct measure, it will be good anyway. But it is important that you file them in the proper way, less vigorously.
 It is our nails we are dealing with, just like hairdressers always use the best scissors.

,,,, Put your nails in it for half an hour or so, daily or on weekends if you lack the time.


Your nail growth will increase by 50%!

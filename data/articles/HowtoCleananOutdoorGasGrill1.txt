 After you use your grill, turn the heat on high and leave for 15 minutes, or until the grill is no longer smoking from burning the food residue. Then turn off your grill.


Leaving the grill burning for 15 minutes allows for any remaining grease or food particles left over from your last use to be burned into ash, and easily removed.;
, When the grilling grates are no longer hot to the touch, (but still warm), turn off the gas supply, and disconnect the gas.Then brush off any loose and ashed particles of food or grease with a steel grill brush. You could also crumple up piece of aluminum foil, and use that to brush off the grates as well.








For a more thorough cleaning, you can remove the grates from the grill, use a sponge dipped in soapy water to wipe them down, and then replace them in the grill once the are rinsed and dried thoroughly, but this is not required after every use.
 Soapy water is the safest cleaning solution for most gas grills.Just make a cleaning solution with water and a squirt or two of mild dishwashing soap. Wipe the exterior of the grill with the soapy water, use a rag dipped in clean water to remove the soap residue, and then dry the exterior of the grill thoroughly.


If you have a stainless steel grill, you can use stainless steel cleaner to clean the exterior. If you have a porcelain grill, you can also use specific porcelain cleaner to clean the outside of the grill., When youâ€™re not using your grill, keep it covered to protect it from outside elements, and prevent it from getting dirtier than it needs to be.


Most grilling brands manufacture their own grill cover specific to the kind of grill purchased.

 Weather loaches (Dojo Loaches) aren't an ordinary loach. They present themselves as an eel like fish that has a slender body, and either have a pink, or brown spotted variant, and can reach up to 8" inches in length and need to be kept in an aquarium at least 40–55 gallons (151.4–208.2 L). They also can be simple to keep as long as, proper needs are met.;
, Dojo loaches aren't aggressive at all however, tankmates should be chosen wisely. Since they're coldwater fish they are able to be kept with goldfish as long as there is a proper tank size for the two. They also are very social fish, so it would be a great idea to keep them in a shoal of 3-6.
 Weather loaches aren't the type to hide behind tall plants. What they do prefer is smaller caves or pieces of PVC pipes. Also, if you are keeping plastic plants in the aquarium, make sure they're silk plants, due to the more rough plastic plants damaging their fins.
, Like all other aquatic animals the weather loach should be acclimated in a fully cycled aquarium. The process of acclimation should last from 15-30 minutes. Once that time has past then, gently net the loach out from the bag and release it from the aquarium without dripping the water into the tank.

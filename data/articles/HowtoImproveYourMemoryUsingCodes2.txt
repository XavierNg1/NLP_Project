2 - N. Notice that N has two straight dark lines drawn in it to remind us of the number two.

3 - M. We drew the letter M with three dark lines so that M reminds us of the number three.

4 - R. Notice we broke the letter R into four dark lines to remind us of the number four.

5 - L. We drew the dark lines of the number five in the shape of an L, to remind us that five is L and L is five.

6 - G. No trouble here-number six looks like the letter G, and the letter G looks like the number six.

7 - K. Notice that the K is drawn half dark and half light. The dark half of the K looks like the number seven has fallen down. Turn the article a quarter turn clockwise and the dark seven in the K will be standing upright.

8 - F. We stuck F inside the Top loop of the number eight because it forms and odd enough looking symbol to remind you that eight is F and F is eight.

9 - P. No trouble here-nine looks like a backward P, and P looks like a backward nine.
 Easy. The letter T sounds like the word Tea.

Two=N=Navy. Think of two Navies with their two ships painted with the number two on them.

Three=M=Ma. Three Ma's greet you when you come home from school. All three look exactly like your Ma. So you yell "Ma, Ma, Ma."

Four=R=Red. Four red rhymes with forehead. Think of four red heads of hair.

Five=L=Lid. Think of five lids of different sizes running around looking for the right size pots to fit onto.

Six=G=Guide. Think of six guides gazing in six directions-up, down, north, east, south, and west.

Seven=K=Key. Think of the number seven with seven keys on it, jangling along while it hops on one Leg.

Eight=F=Fuzz. Think of stuffing the number eight into a huge pile of fuzz. Think of eight with fuzzy whiskers.

Nine=P=Pa. Imagine your Pa shaped like the figure nine. You say to him, "Pa, watch your posture."

, When you can say all nine letters and numbers in two minutes, you're doing fine.
, We substitute the letters TS for the number Ten. But TS isn't a word, so we drop in a couple vowels-and TS becomes ToeS. Get the idea?


How about the number Eleven? What key word can you make out of it? Again, remember that the number One is the equivalent of the letter T. So the number Eleven becomes TT. Stick in a vowel and TT becomes ToT-our eleventh key word, meaning a small child.
Now let's see what we can do with the number Twelve. The number One is T. The number Two is N. Put them together and you have TN. Stick in a vowel and you have word number Twelve-TiN. (Of course we could have made the word ToN, but it wouldn't have been a picture word. TiN you can see, ToN you can't see.)
How about the Thirteenth key word? Again, the number One is T. The number Three is the letter M. Put them together and you have TM. Here again, we could make TM into ToM or TiMe-but neither is a picture word. So we'll try TiMer, a stopwatch used for timing sporting events.
One more example should clear up any questions about this system. Number Fourteen is equal to the letters TR. TRain should do it.

This is how the first twenty key words and numbers turn out to be: One=Tea, Two=Navy, Three=Ma, Four=Red, Five=Lid, Six=Guide, Seven=Key, Eight=Fuzz, Nine=Pa, Ten=ToeS, Eleven=ToT, Twelve=TiN, Thirteen=TiMer, Fourteen=TRain, Fifteen=TaiL, Sixteen=TiGer, Seventeen=TicK (The bug that bites you), Eighteen=TaFfy, Nineteen=ToP (The kind you spin), Twenty=NoSe



, Say, "What is Nineteen?" The letters TP must come to mind if you remember the linkups. What do you make of it? Look at the list to see if you're right. Try 20. Two is N and the number Zero is always S. NS becomes what word? Look at our list to see if you've come up with the right answer.
 The number Eight is F. The number Five is L. FL suggests what word. It's short. Its second letter is a vowel. Write out your word and check the list that follows to see if you got the right word. Notice I said the "right" word, the right word being the right word for you. Remember, you can always come up with your own picture words.


This is how the last eighty key words and numbers turn out to be (in groups of ten):

Twenty-one=NeT, Twenty-two=NuN, Twenty-three=NaMetag, Twenty-four=NuRse, Twenty-five=NaiL, Twenty-six=NiaGara (Falls), Twenty-seven=NicKel (The coin), Twenty-eight=NiFe (It's really kNife, but it sounds like NiFe. This is because no other word could be found for the NF combination.), Twenty-nine=NaPkin, Thirty=MiSt,
Thirty-one=MiTt, Thirty-two=MiNe (A coal or gold mine), Thirty-three=MuMmy, Thirty-four=MiRror, Thirty-five=MaLlet (A wooden headed hammer), Thirty-six=MuG, Thirty-seven=MiKe (A microphone), Thirty-eight=MaFia (Think of a mob of gangsters with guns), Thirty-nine=MaP, Forty=RaSp (A large rough type of FiLe),
Forty-one=RaT, Forty-two=RiNk, Forty-three=RooM, Forty-four=R.R. (A railroad), Forty-five=RoLl (A bun or pastry), Forty-six=RaG, Forty-seven=RocK, Forty-eight=RaFt, Forty-nine=RiP (A tear in a sheet), Fifty=LeTtuce,

Sixty-one=GuT (intestine), Sixty-two=GuN, Sixty-three=GuM, Sixty-four=GaRter, Sixty-five=GoaL (a football goal PoSt), Sixty-six=GoGles (Eye-glasses), Sixty-seven=GooK (A gooey mess of some kind), Sixty-eight=GaFf (A spear for hooking a fish), Sixty-nine=GuPpy (A minnow, or small fish), Seventy=KiSser (Slang for a face),
Seventy-one=KiTe, Seventy-two=KiN (Think of a special relative of yours), Seventy-three=KiMono (A loose robe or gown), Seventy-four=KeRenel (A grain of corn), Seventy-five=KiLn (stove or oven), Seventy-six=KeG, Seventy-seven=KicKer, Seventy-eight=KoFee (It's really coffee, but koffee sounds the same. KF is hard to make into a picture word), Seventy-nine=KiPper (A fish), Eighty=FiSt,
Eighty-one=FooT, Eighty-two=FaN (A machine for cooling the house), Eighty-three=FeMale, Eighty-four=FiRe, Eighty-five=FiLe (A fingernail file), Eighty-six=FiG, Eighty-seven=FaKir (Think of a turbaned Indian standing before a cobra), Eighty-eight=FiFe (A flute), Eighty-nine=FoP (Think of a dandy dresser), Ninety=PoSt,
Ninety-one=PiT (A peach or plum pit), Ninety-two=PeN (A writing pen), Ninety-three=PiMple, Ninety-four=PeaR, Ninety-five=PaiL, Ninety-six=PiG, Ninety-seven=PicKle, Ninety-eight=PuFf Adder (A poisonous snake), Ninety-nine=PoPcorn, One Hundred=TiSSue.
 If you remember more than half of the words these numbers represent, you're doing very well. With time and a little practice you'll soon know all one hundred numbers.
 The three things this code involves is: One-Be absolutely confident that you can remember any name quickly, Two-Pay attention to each person you meet (I don't mean that you should stand and stare at people until they feel uncomfortable, but do talk and be friendly while you do your people-watching.), Three-Link up or associate the name with the way he or she looks or acts.


Suppose you meet a Mr. Silverman. You look him over and note-among other things-that he walks very straight. That his hair is gray-or silver. Imagine yourself pouring a vat of liquid silver over his head so that it runs down all over him, hardens, and stops him in his tracks. You've just made him a silver man. Picture him that way.
Or how about a Mrs. Saltinstall? You notice that she smiles a lot and has beautiful white teeth. Imagine her gargling with salt water. Imagine her getting to big a mouthful of salt, sputtering, and running off to her car. She jumps in it and it stalls. These two sounds-salt-stall-or just one of them, will recall her name to you the next time you see her.
How about a Mr. Franklin? Try this name yourself first, then see if some of your associations are the same as mine, even though they don't have to be the same.

Imagine Mr. Franklin flying a kite-the way Ben Franklin did. Mr. Franklin mentioned that he likes to eat-so I imagined him eating a three-foot long Frank with lint all over it. (Don't worry about calling him Mr. Hot Dog the next time you meet him.) Since Mr. Franklin says what's on his mind-I knew that he was frank-or outspoken.


We'll try one more-a Mrs. Mussel. Mussel sounds like muscle. Mrs. Mussel is skinny, about ninety pounds. That's what stays in your mind after you've looked her over. You imagine her flexing her right arm muscle and you're amazed that the muscle is huge-bigger than all the rest of her.(Another thing to remember is to get action into your mental pictures. Things in motion are easier to see than things that stand still.)

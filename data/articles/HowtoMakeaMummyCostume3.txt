 The knots in the end will actually add texture to your mummy and look purposeful -- not like you took the easy way out!

, Any combination of white long-sleeved something and white pair of pants will suit this costume. However, something bulky (like cargo pants) isn't ideal for your mummy silhouette.


Don't forget those thick wool socks!

, You can either use overlapping to secure the end, or just add another tie (since you already have loads, it'll blend right in). Go in straight lines, criss-cross, and however else you need to cover every inch. Repeat for the other leg and hips. When you hit the end of your strip, either tie on another one, tie it to an already-wrapped section, or just tuck it in.


With material from one leg, wrap around the pelvis. This can be your first or second leg. But don't wrap above the waistline of the pants -- those glasses of Halloween punch will be no match for even the steeliest of bladders. What a nightmare.
 This is easiest if you form an X over the sternum and wrap strap-like strips over the shoulders. A fair amount of overlap will be needed to cover every inch. Again, if you run out, just tie on another strip or tie off the one you're using and start anew.
 If you've ever wrapped a wrist for boxing or other sport, use the same artful weaving between the fingers. If you haven't...well, weave the material between the fingers, around the base of the thumb, and onto the wrist, over and over. In case you run out, start at the fingers and work your way up to the shoulder.

 Stretch open the opening of the stocking leg.
 The toe area will sit underneath the pumpkin. The open area (for inserting the leg usually) will cradle around the pumpkin's stem.
 Either tie a neat knot using the stocking end or glue in place.


Alternatively, wrap a rubber band around it to keep it in place (a hair elastic in the same color is a good choice).
 The easy-as stocking pumpkin is now ready for placing on display.

 Walk through the shelter, giving all the cats a good look. Watch to see if any of the cats try to follow you or look especially interested in getting to know you. An engaged, curious cat is more likely to do better in a family than one who's not.However, don't rule out the nappers. A cat sleeps up to 16 hours each day, so the perfect cat may be conked out in the corner.
 If the shelter has an area to do it, sit down on the floor with the cat. Give it a chance to warm up to you. Don't drag it over to you. Let it investigate you and come over. Hold out your hand for it to smell, so it gets a chance to learn about you., Once you've narrowed down your options, try petting the cats you've picked out. Of course, the cat will likely be wary at first, but a cat that reacts aggressively to being petted (such as biting or hissing) likely isn't a good one for a family home., If the cat seemed okay with the pet test, try picking it up. Most cats will be a little nervous, but if the cat accepts being picked up without too much animosity, that means it is likely fine with being handled. That's a good personality trait to have in family cat., Once you've decided on a good option, have the kids come meet the cat. If the cat is aggressive towards the kids, obviously you don't want to bring that cat home. If the cat seems interested but a little cautious, that cat will likely be okay. If the cat is very interested and asks for attention from your kids, that cat is likely a great choice.


Prep your kids before entering the shelter. No cat is going to take kindly to being pounced upon by a whole gaggle of kids or having its tail pulled. Tell your kids they need to be quiet and gentle, as well as let the cat approach them.

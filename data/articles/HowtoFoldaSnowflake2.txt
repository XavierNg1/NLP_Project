 A good size to start with is an 8.5”x11” piece of paper. Cut the paper in half—making the cut across the width rather than the length. Now from these two pieces, you want to cut squares. This will give you snowflakes that are 5” across.


To make a perfect square, simply fold one corner across the paper so that one of the sides lines up perfectly into an isosceles triangle. Trim the excess paper., Take your square and fold the bottom right corner to the top left corner to make a large triangle. Fold this larger triangle in half to create a smaller triangle., Place the point toward you. Take the top right corner and fold it straight across in the triangle. Instead of folding in half this time, fold it in thirds. Once you fold the right corner over, fold the left corner over as well. Your ending product should look like an upside-down cone with a small triangle missing from the top.


If you have a protractor and want to be precise, each third will be a 30 degree angle.
 With your paper folded in thirds, cut the top of the paper off at an angle. Do so in a way that all the layers on the top are now even. You’ll once again have a smaller triangle than you had before., Cut away shapes from the sides of the paper. Small triangles are easiest to start with, but adding more complex shapes to different parts of your triangle will make for a more interesting snowflake. Feel free to cut the shapes out of the bottom of your cone shape to alter the edge of your snowflake. Cutting the tip off will add a shape in the middle., Your snowflake is finished! If you want to make any adjustments after you unfold it, you can. If it’s not sitting flat, put in in between the pages of a book or a stack of magazines. Tape them to your windows or hang them around the house to showcase your beautiful 6-point snowflake.

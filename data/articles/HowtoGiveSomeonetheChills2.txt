If you know of a song that has a story that resonates with a friend or partner’s current life situation, playing this song may give them the chills as well.For example, if there is a song about rediscovering love after a break up and you have a friend going through a similar situation, then playing this song may give them the chills.
 Crisp sounds like a pen writing on a piece of paper, fire crackling, vegetables being cut, or paper crumpling can give people chills. Play a recording of one of these sounds or make the sounds yourself to give someone the chills.Additionally, sounds like running water, ocean waves, and white noise can also give someone the chills.
Rubbing two different textures together can also give someone chills, like nails on a chalkboard.
 Soft or slow speech patterns can also give someone the chills. Think of a massage therapist’s voice or the voice of a practitioner doing guided meditation. You can also try whispering in someone’s ear to induce chills.For example, whispering in a low voice, "I am watching you" or, "I am right behind you" could give someone the chills.

 Storage units can be purchased at either Re-Tail or at Nookling’s store, and often come in the form of dressers, wardrobes, cupboards, cabinets, and refrigerators. While only New Leaf has Re-Tail, each Animal Crossing game contains a Nook store, which is where furniture can be purchased.

To purchase a storage unit, simply head to the store (location varies from game to game), face a dresser, and hit the “A” button to purchase it

, Once you’ve bought a storage unit, or if you already have one in your inventory, go home and place it anywhere you want in your house., To store items in the storage unit, approach it and hit the “A” button. A menu will pop up that displays both your inventory and spaces in the dresser. Select items that you want to move over by dragging them into empty spaces with either your stylus or the Wii remote.

In total, the storage units offer 180 spaces for players to store their items in.
Although it is possible to own several storage units, they all share the same storage system. This means something you put in the dresser in your basement can be accessed if you look in the cabinet in an upstairs room.

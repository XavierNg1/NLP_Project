 It is thought that most charges are "mock" (threat) charges, that is, the elephant is pretending to charge but is actually testing you out to see if you're aggressive or a non-threat. Be able to recognize the difference between an elephant who is making a mock charge and an elephant who is about to trample you.;

If an elephant's ears are relaxed, he is probably making a mock charge. Ears that are fanned out are indicative of a mock charge.If the elephant's ears are pinned back flat, it is likely that the charge is real.This will often be accompanied by a trunk that is curled inward., You're likely to hear trumpeting of a warning from the elephant.
 There are some other indicators of an elephant working out whether to charge or retreat. These include a twitching trunk and swinging one leg to and fro.The biologist responsible for discovering this, Dr. George Schaller, realized that the more pronounced these "displacement activities", the more likely the elephant was making a threatening show out of fear and had no intention to really charge.

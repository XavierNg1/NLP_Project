 Contract phones need to be locked to the mobile network carrier for a specific span of time, as stated in the contract or agreement. However, some carriers lets you unlock your phone even while under contract, as long as you meet the following criteria:


You are the owner of the Optimus G and can provide the account details related to the phone’s contract.
Your phone has already been paid in full price, regardless of the remaining time you need to stay on the service as stated in the contract. In example, you’ve already paid the full price of the Optimus G even if you’re only on the first year of your contract.
Your phone was not reported as stolen or lost.
 If you meet these basic criteria, then you may call your carrier’s customer service hotline and ask if your Optimus G is eligible for unlocking. If it is, they will assist you with the process of unlocking your phone. You may call these numbers if your Optimus G is from one of these carriers:
AT&T (U.S. Clients): (800) 331-0500
Verizon (U.S. Clients): (800) 922-0204 or dial *611 from your Verizon phone
Sprint (U.S. Clients): (844) 665-6327 or dial *2 from your Sprint phone


Once your phone has been unlocked, you can now use any SIM from other mobile network carriers, both local and international.

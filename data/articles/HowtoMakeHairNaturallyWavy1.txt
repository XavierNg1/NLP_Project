 Regardless of which of the below methods you choose, getting your hair wet first is an important step. Curls will look better in clean hair.


Use shampoo to make sure your hair is clean.
When using conditioner, do not apply it to your scalp but instead focus on the ends of your hair. This makes your hair lighter so that it is not weighted down.;
, Eliminate excess water by squeezing it out or using a towel. Leave your hair slightly damp. The curls will last longer this way.









If you have very thick hair, use a blow dryer to remove some of the water. Your hair should be damp, but not sopping wet.
Removing tangles from your hair will allow you to create smooth waves rather than knots which may catch or look unappealing.
 Leave-in conditioners make hair smoother, stronger and more flexible. Begin by working a small amount, about 1 tsp, into your hair. Too much conditioner can leave your hair weighed-down.









Apply conditioner to sections of your hair to ensure it is evenly distributed from root to tip.
You can add more conditioner as needed., If you have very straight hair that struggles to hold a curl, adding a texturing spray, a small amount of mousse, or some hairspray may help your hair hold a curl for longer.









Often it works best to apply this to the under side of your hair so the crown of your head does not look greasy or heavy.
Lean over so that your hair is flipped upside down and use your fingers to work a small amount of gel or spray into your hair.

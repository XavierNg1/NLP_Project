 Throwing a theme party is a great way to liven things up from the get go! If you didn’t plan for this ahead, let your guests help pick a theme for the night. This is an easy way to get people talking and set a creative and fun atmosphere for your party. Later on you can keep the fun going by holding a contest for best costume or most enthusiastic guest!


Break out some extra sheets and turn your boring party into a toga party, or pull out Halloween decorations and turn the party into a costume party.;
, If things are getting a little too quiet, it’s both polite and helpful to touch base with each of your guests. You can be the social mixer that gets everyone engaged in good conversation. Try to get different groups of people to talk to each other, the more intermingling between guests, the better the conversation flow tends to be.


People love to talk about themselves. Try sparking conversations with questions like "How are things at work?" "Did you see the latest blockbuster?" Or "How did your vacation go, would you recommend the hotel you stayed in?"
People also love talking about food. Try asking different groups of people things like "Where is the best pizza joint around here?" Or start a debate about the best restaurant to take a first date. Either way, things like this will definitely get people chatting.
 Everyone enjoys a good laugh, quickly liven things up with a few tasteful jokes. Encourage your guests to chime in, or have a quick contest to see who can come up with the best wisecracks. With willing participants, you can even hold your very own roast session on someone. Someone with a great sense of humor can save any dull situation.
 If applicable, kids are natural born entertainers and can work wonders for a lull in party entertainment. If your party is turning into a gathering of awkward silences, divert everyone’s attention to the kids as they put on a play, sing, or dance for you. Who can resist a youngster's rendition of the Frozen soundtrack?

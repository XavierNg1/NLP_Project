 Open-admission animal shelters accept all pets, but they do not guarantee that the animals in their care will be adopted. More importantly, this type of shelter will euthanize incoming animals when they run out of space., If you choose to leave your cat behind when vacating your home, it will probably run out of food and water before the house is repossessed. This will cause your cat to face a slow and inhumane death by starvation. Even if the home gets repossessed quickly and your cat is discovered, in many jurisdictions, leaving your cat behind is illegal., Some people assume that when they turn their cat loose in the woods or on the street, its hunting and survival instincts will kick in. But in fact, cats (along with most animals) raised in domestic environments are often unable to effectively adapt to life in the wild. Your cat risks being attacked by larger animals or hit by a car if you turn it loose. Additionally, doing so might be illegal in your jurisdiction.

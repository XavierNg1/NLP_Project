 There are several different levels of nursing, and each depends largely on the amount of education you're willing to pursue. Make sure that the nursing program you're enrolled in is approved by the Colorado Board of Nursing.
 All nursing assistants in Colorado must be certified. Accredited programs take 6 to 12 weeks to complete. In Colorado, most nursing aides achieve certification by passing a board exam. Aides who are registered in another state may be certified to work in Colorado automatically by the process of endorsement. Nursing assistants work under the direct supervision of a registered nurse, performing important duties that include taking vital signs, drawing blood, and other basic nursing functions. Nursing assistants work in all types of health-care facilities. Many advance their careers by pursuing additional education and training.

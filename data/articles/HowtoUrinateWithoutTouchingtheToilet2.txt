 Of course you'd love to just not have to deal with bathroom germs, but that is not realistic. Instead, plan your bathroom breaks to coincide with being near the cleanest possible area. If you're on a road trip, scope out gas stations that have a great reputation for being clean. Use social media and travel websites that post a lot of reviews to help with your research.


Also, wear clothes that are easy to manage. Loose fitting clothing that is easy to manipulate is your best bet.
You can also plan ahead by thinking about how to navigate the room or stall while touching as few surfaces as possible. For example, touch up your make-up in the car. Then you will have to spend less time in the restroom, and will therefore touch fewer surfaces. , If you don't want to either squat or touch the seat, you need a barrier. Utilize the paper liners that are in many public restrooms, taking care to flush them when you're done. If a liner is not available, you can line the seat with fresh toilet paper to protect your tush.Try traveling with your own supply of paper liners. Small travel packs are often available at convenience stores, and can eliminate a lot of your problems.
 The handle of the toilet is actually one of the filthiest parts of any bathroom. Often it can be tempting to use your foot to flush. Resist this urge! This can actually cause mechanical issues, which could result in you getting some backsplash from the toilet. Instead, use a piece of toilet paper and use your hand to flush., Most of the germs in bathrooms are a result of people not washing their hands. They touch many surfaces and the result is contamination. Take care to wash your hands many times a day (not just after using the restroom) to help protect your health.

 There are two main types of asthma: extrinsic (allergic) and intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma.Extrinsic asthma is more common, and it involves an immune response triggered by inhaled allergens that cause an allergic reaction in your lungs. When this reaction occurs, your airways become inflamed and make it difficult to breathe.This type of asthma may be mild, moderate, or severe and will vary in time between attacks.
 Intrinsic asthma is triggered by cold air, exercise, dry air, and/or stress. The immune response is somewhat less critical in intrinsic asthma, but it also involves an inflammatory response. This form of asthma may be mild, moderate, or severe.

 Take a break from any activities that require you to run, jump or squat. Don’t ignore your nagging pain and try to exercise through it. It will not go away. In fact, it will only get worse the more you exercise. Continuing to exercise may lead to further injury.If you experience a lot of pain, you should stop exercising and rest your leg from activities that aggravate the condition.
 If you feel pain or swelling, you ice your knee. Create an ice pack by adding ice into a plastic bag and placing the bag inside a towel. Apply the ice to relieve pain and possible swelling that you might be experiencing. Apply ice for 10 minutes after exercise for pain relief, but note that ice will not help the underlying condition.
 This strap is a band that goes around your leg just under the patella. The strap puts pressure on the tendon, thereby redistributing the load throughout the tendon and reducing pain.This is a good support device to use during rehabilitation.
A patellar tendon strap can be purchased at most drug and medical supply stores.
Even if you use a strap, you still need to give your tendon time to heal.
 If you experience pain when resting your leg, you probably need a brace to immobilize your leg. Once pain subsides while you’re resting, you can gradually increase your activity. Only do as much as your leg will allow without the pain returning.If you are experiencing enough pain that you need to immobilize your leg, you definitely need to see your doctor. You will likely need to rest your leg until you are fully recovered.

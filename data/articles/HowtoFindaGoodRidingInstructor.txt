 Some people just want a trainer for a weekly lesson, while some like anywhere from two to four lessons per week. This will help you narrow down your search, although most trainers have plenty of once-a-weekers, and competitive riders, too. You should also think about what kind of money you're willing to spend. More well-known trainers usually charge more, but a less-known trainer will charge a good deal less. Think about how far you're willing to travel, and maybe, if you keep your horse at your place, if you'd like the instructor to come to you.;
, Check with your horsey friends to see where they ride, and the other barns in the area, if you don't already know. Once you know this, you can call up and set up a lesson. Sometimes, even if you have your own horse already, you can usually ride a lesson horse. You'll see how much effort they put into the lesson program. Visit every barn in your area.
 A dirty, unorganized barn is a recipe for disaster!

, Sometimes, you can gain more from watching than from actually taking a lesson. But be sure to call and schedule a time in advance!

, Many farms put up lots of information about lesson rates, what they do, and information about the farm as well as pictures of horses and students.

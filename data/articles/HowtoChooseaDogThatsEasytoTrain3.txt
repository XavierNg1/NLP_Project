 When you decide to adopt a dog, you should take your lifestyle into account. A dog, no matter how easy they are to train, will need your time, affection, and dedication. Think about how much time you will have to spend training, exercising, and caring for a dog before you decide to make a lifelong commitment to the animal., You should take your living space into account when you decide to become a dog owner. Consider how large your home is, as well as what types of exercise-friendly spaces your new dog will be able to access. For example, a large breed might not be a great choice if you live in a small apartment and don't have access to a yard - you'll have a harder time training them. If you choose an active breed, you will need to make sure the dog will have access to a yard, dog park, or trails on a daily basis.
 When you choose a dog, you should think about how its age will affect both your lifestyle and its potential for training. In some cases, it can be easier to mold the behaviors and personality of a puppy or adolescent dog. While age doesnâ€™t determine how trainable a dog is, some older dogs might already know certain commands, making training easier.

 To get the best benefits from your at-home Zumba routines, you need to make sure you develop a good fitness plan. You should shoot for five to six days per week. If you are a beginner, you may want to try three to four days at first and work up to five or six days., Zumba toning is a variation of the traditional Zumba dancing. This type of Zumba uses small hand weights to add upper body exercises to the predominantly lower body routines.Most Zumba toning workouts suggest using one to three pound hand weights.
 If you were doing Zumba at a gym, you’d be facing a gigantic mirror. Plus, you’d have an instructor who can help give tips on your form. At home, you are on your own, so working out in front of a mirror can help you see what you are doing so you can improve your steps.After you get comfortable with a routine and don’t have to stare at the instructor every second, you can put on the video and watch yourself.

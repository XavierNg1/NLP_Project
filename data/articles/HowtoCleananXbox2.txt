 Before cleaning your console, make sure that it is unplugged from the outlet. This will allow you to turn the system over and thoroughly wipe it down.
 You can purchase a microfiber cloth at a computer supply store or online. Wipe down the top, bottom, sides, and ports of the system with a microfiber cloth.You can use cotton swabs to get to hard to reach areas, just make sure not to push dust deeper into the system.
 Use the detail nozzle on a can of condensed air and go over the entirety of the system, including the ventilation slots and the ports. This will remove any dust that you were unable to reach with your cloth.

 While you can put anything instead of a parameter, it won't have much use.


Replace y with what parameter you want to check.
Replace z with what you want to appear if y is supplied.
Replace a with what you want to appear if y isn't supplied.;
, As with #if:, this parser function is most helpful when used with parameters rather than plain text.


Replace y and z with what strings/parameters you want to compare.
Replace a with what you want to appear if y and z are the same.
Replace b with what you want to appear if y and z aren't the same.




{{ #switch: y | a=b | c=d | e=f }}

Replace a, c, e, etc. with what result you want to appear if what you supply for y.
Replace b, d, f, etc. with what you want to appear if y happens to equal a, c, e, and so on.
 This parser function can be pretty handy with parameters and magic words at times.



{{ #expr: y }}

Replace y with the math problem you want to solve.

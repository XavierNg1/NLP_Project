 Newborn puppies depend on heat from their mother to keep them warm. Without a mother, orphaned newborn puppies are at risk of becoming cold, which could quickly become an emergency situation.Use artificial sources of heat to keep the nesting box warm:


Heating pad: set the heating pad on low, wrap it in a towel, and place it under half of the nesting box. In case the puppies get too warm, they’ll need a space in the nesting box where they can move to cool off.Heat lamp: place it over one side of the nesting box.Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature.
 In the first two weeks of life, newborn puppies cannot regulate their own body temperature. Until the puppies are four weeks old, you will need adjust the temperature to keep them warm and comfortable. Reposition the heat sources and continue using a thermometer:First week: 84 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (29 to 32 degrees Celsius)
Second week: 79 to 84 degrees Fahrenheit (26 to 29 degrees Celsius)
Third week: 73 to 79 degrees Fahrenheit (23 to 26 degrees Celsius)
Fourth through twelfth weeks: 73 degrees Fahrenheit (23 degrees Celsius)

, The way the puppies lay in the nesting box will let you know if they are comfortable, too hot, or too cold. If the puppies are piled on top of each other, they are cold and using each other to stay warm. If they’re spread far apart, the puppies are too warm. If they’re lying next to each other, they’re comfortable., A newborn puppy’s body temperature should be between 95 and 99 degrees Fahrenheit (35 and 37 degrees Celsius).A body temperature below 95 degrees Fahrenheit is dangerous—the puppy’s heart will slow down and the digestive tract won’t work very well.If any of the puppies’ body temperatures drop below 95 degrees Fahrenheit, slowly warm them up over two to three hours.Place the cold puppy on a hot water bottle.Wrap the water bottle with a towel so the puppy’s skin doesn’t get burned. The puppy will likely move off the water bottle when it warms up.

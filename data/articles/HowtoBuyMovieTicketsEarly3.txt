 There are some benefits to doing it old school, particularly if you are trying to reserve tickets at a small art theater or if you want tickets for a showing later that day. The person at the ticket booth is likely to give you better service and less likely to turn you down if you have a specific request (such as buying a ticket far in advance).
 Because many people buy tickets online or just before a movie screening, itâ€™s important to emphasize that you want a ticket for a later showing.
 Another benefit of buying your ticket in person is that, unlike the other methods, you can pay in cash if desired. Theaters generally accept most credit and debit cards as well.
 You can either leave the theater and come back before the showing or you can also wait in the general area. That way, you can head into the screening room early and get the best seating possible.


Some theaters now have lounges and even bars or cafes that you can relax in before heading to your movie. If this is the case, be sure to check them out.
Be aware that theaters are paid to play trailers before the featureso you could be watching these for up to twenty minutes before your movie begins. If this will bother you, consider entering the screening room a little after the official starting time.

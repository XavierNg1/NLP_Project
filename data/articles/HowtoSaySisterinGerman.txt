You need to consider in what way you want to use this word to ensure it is used correctly.
Are you talking about a full sister? or a half sister? Will she be present when you speak about her? or will you be speaking about her in the third person?

The correct word is "Schwester". The first portion of this word the "sch" is pronounced similar to the start of "schnapps" the drink and the rest of the word "wester" is pronounced as it sounds.
Now put the two sounds together to make "Schwester"

The word for Sister does not change from the above step however as in English we insert My in front of the word sister, the Germans inserted a word before "Schwester" to complete this saying.
The German word need to be added here is "Meine". This word is pronounced with a "My" sound to start despite it's spelling and finishes with a "Na". Now put these sounds together to pronounce "My-na" and you are saying the word for "Meine", when you add the previous word "Schwester" you are now saying "My Sister" in German







, The word for this expression in German is one word. "Halbschwester" instead of the English two words. The first half of this word is "Halb" as it is in English added with it is the previously discussed "Schwester" to create "Halbschwester".
 The word for little in this context is "kleine". It roughly translates to the English word of "small" but it is the correct word for this context. To pronounce the first sound is "klein" like Calvin Klein the designer and the second sound is a "na" sound. So add the two together to make "kleinna" sound. Now add the previous word "Schwester" for sister to make the full saying "Kleine Schwester"

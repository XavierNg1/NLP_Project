 Anything from about 1.5m by 0.75m to 1.5 by 1.5 will work. A large, lightweight scarf works best. The bigger the material you use, the larger the turban will be, so choose accordingly. Also, thinner materials will be easier to handle.
 If your scarf is square, fold it into a triangle shape. If it is rectangular, fold it in half, length-wise. Place the scarf on your head so that the center is lined up with the nape of your neck. If you've folded your scarf into a triangle, the point should lie over your face., Take the ends of the scarf and pull them tight across your temples. Cross the two ends over one another over your forehead. Make it tight enough to stay in place but not too tight to be comfortable., Pull the scarf ends back around to the nape of your neck. Tie a tight knot. If you started with a rectangular shape, either tuck the excess fabric under the knot, or around the sides and into the front fold, depending on how much fabric is left. If you started with a triangle shape, tuck the excess fabric under the back of the turban, and tuck the point in the front backwards into the front fold.

If you don’t have a Minecraft shortcut icon on your desktop, find it in your programs list and click the icon there.
 From the main menu of the game, select “Single Player.” This is located at the top of the menu.
 If you have an existing world or server, select the world from the list then click “Play Selected World.”

, Once the world has loaded, press / on your keyboard to open up the chat box so that a command can be entered.
 Type one of these commands (with no quotation marks) into the chat box to attain a command block:


“/give minecraft:command_block ” — This command will place a command block directly into your inventory. For example: /give Steve minecraft:command_block 5
“/setblock x y z minecraft:command_block” — The setblock command changes a particular block into a command block using its location. To determine the location of a block, press F3 on your keyboard and look at the block you wish to change. The coordinates of the block being looked at will be displayed.
“/summon Item x y z {Item: {id:minecraft:command_block, Count:1}}” — This will summon a command block at the selected location. You can use the ~ symbol to represent your current location for each coordinate.
You can also use the command /give 137 . (Do not include the brackets in the command.)

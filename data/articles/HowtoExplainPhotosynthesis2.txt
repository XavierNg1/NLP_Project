 The chloroplast is an organelle within plant cells that allows for photosynthesis to occur. The light dependent phase of photosynthesis uses the energy from the sun to create energy storing molecules that are needed later in the photosynthetic process.This is made possible by a substance in the chloroplasts, called chlorophyll, that absorbs electromagnetic energy (in the form of light) from the sun.It is appropriate to mention chlorophyll to children, but keep it very basic.
 The light dependent reactions take place in two phases. First, the light activated photosystem II splits water molecules. This creates creates molecular oxygen, O2 and H+ ions (also known as protons). Some of the protons are utilized, to form adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from adenosine diphosphate (ADP). The remaining protons are transferred from photosystem II to photosystem I, and there they are used to convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ion (NADP+) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADPH.Photosystem II and photosystem I are too complicated for most children to be interested. It is okay to leave this out when teaching photosynthesis to kids.
 The primary products of the light dependent reactions are oxygen, ATP, and NADPH. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere, while the ATP and NADPH are utilized by the plant for the next phase of photosynthesis - the light independent reactions (also known as the Calvin Cycle). No carbohydrates are produced during the light dependent phase of photosynthesis.

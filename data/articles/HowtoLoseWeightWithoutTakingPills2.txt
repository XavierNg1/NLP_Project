 You should certainly check with a doctor before beginning an exercise regimen if you have heart disease, asthma, diabetes or other ailments.The doctor can also help you determine what a healthy weight would be for you, as well as how you may be able to reach that weight.


This is especially important if you need to lose a large amount of weight, but consulting with a doctor is always a good idea, regardless of the amount of weight needing to be lost.
 Also known simply as "cardio," aerobic exercise can be beneficial because it speeds up your metabolism for a while after your exercise routine comes to an end. This means your body will use calories faster during this time, and you will lose weight by burning more calories than you take in.Aerobic exercise is exercise that is low, medium, or high intensity and performed for a longer duration continuously.
Try to get 30 minutes of aerobic exercise five to seven days per week.
 When you practice strength training, you will make your muscles bigger. Bigger muscles require more calories, so you will increase the amount of calories you burn even at rest if you have bigger muscles.Push-ups, crunches, bicep curls, squats, and lunges are examples of strength training exercises.
An hour-long strength training session three times per week can help you lose weight during and after exercise.
 Walking can be a great workout for people who need more low-impact exercise because of other health issues that preclude them from getting aerobic exercise. Walking is also good for mental health as it is overall health.Walking 45 minutes per day can help you lose up to one pound per week.

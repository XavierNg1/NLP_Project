 Trim it off at the lowest equal point.;
, Set your iron to your fabric's setting. If your fabric setting isn't a steam setting, set the iron to the lowest steam setting and set the steam as low as possible (sometimes fine fabrics will water-spot, simply set your iron to the lowest heat setting and iron until the water spots have evaporated).
,, Empty the water from it. (Store the iron completely dry for best working order next time.)

, Yes, you will have to stop sooner, but a shorter piece of thread insures smooth working without snags or as many mistakes. Tie a knot in one end of the thread -- don't tie them together -- you will be working with only one thread, this will help your stitches appear invisible.
 Then, catching just a few threads of the outside of the fabric start hemming. To speed yourself along catch first the hem then the fabric, then the hem until your needle is full, and then pull the thread until it lies flat again. Don't worry about doing anything fancy, just a basic slip stitch is fine.
 In other words, make another stitch directly on top of the last one. This will act as a safety: if part of your hem falls, it will stop before the whole thing unravels.


It is a good idea to buy pin and needles made for lightweight and silk fabrics,also there is thread that is light or made of silk that will work better than a regular thickness.

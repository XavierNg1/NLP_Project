 As soon as you notice that your dog is missing, search around your house to make sure they aren’t hiding or sleeping somewhere. Once you have confirmed that your dog is missing, alert your neighbors right away. Then, slowly drive around your neighborhood calling your dogs name as you go along.Bring a picture of your dog with you so you can ask any of your neighbors that happen to be outside if they have seen your dog.
 Call your local shelters, rescue groups, animal control agencies, and veterinary hospitals. Give them a description of your dog, as well as the dog’s name. Also bring photos of your dog to these places, and check-in with them regularly to see if they have found your dog. If there aren’t any of these places near your house, contact your local police department.Services like HomeAgain or Lost My Doggie will allow you to post online that your pet is missing. These services will notify people in your area, pet shelters, and pet rescues that your pet is missing. They will also contact you if your pet has been found.
 Create flyers that will stand out and get noticed. For example, create a flyer on bright green paper with a bold headline that people can read from afar, for example, “LOST DOG.” On the flyer, include your dog’s specifications, like name, breed, sex, age, coloring, weight, and any distinguishing features. Also, include your contact information, like your name, phone number, and an email. In case you cannot be reached, include the name and phone number of a family member or friend, as well.Post the flyers around dog parks, running trails, your neighborhood, pet supply and grooming stores, veterinary offices, and places you frequent with your dog.
 Most importantly, don’t give up. Many lost dogs eventually find their way back home. Scan your neighborhood weekly until you have found your dog. Regularly check in with the places mentioned above, and replace old flyers with new ones.

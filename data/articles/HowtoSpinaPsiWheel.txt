 Make sure it is easily knocked over when you blow on it, as this means it will be easy to spin. If it is not balancing, make a new one.;
, If there are any fans on, turn them off. If you are listening to music, turn it off.



Telekinesis believers will tell you that your psychic forces are making this happen. Try concentrating very hard on moving the wheel; visualize energy flowing from your body, out of your hand, and pushing the wheel. Does it work better when you do that? If so, you might want to put that psychic energy to work and make a psi ball or use dowsing rods.
Scientists will tell you that the warmth of your hands causes the air on that side of the wheel to heat up; since heat rises, the warm air goes up, creating an upward current that spins the psi wheel. Try getting your hand warmer by cupping your hands on your mouth and blowing, then immediately try to rotate the wheel. Does it work better that way? Try sticking your hand in the freezer, then rotate the wheel. Does it work?

,


Cover your mouth and nose with a cotton blanket so your breath does not affect the wheel.
Sit about half a meter away from the wheel in a comfortable spot with a good view of the psi wheel.

Clear your mind.
Think about how much you want it to spin; yearn for it to spin. Build up the want for the wheel to spin.
Make it move.

Ask, out loud or in your head, for the wheel to move.
Imagine blowing on the wheel causing it to spin.
Imagine the wheel spinning rapidly.
Imagine pushing the wheel with your fingers.
Imagine energy flowing from your eyes pushing the wheel.

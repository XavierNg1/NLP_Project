This will allow you to take another cloth with lubricant and apply a generous portion to the bottom of the bolt assembly., Take the cleaning rods and your bore brush, and sweep the barrel very carefully. This will loosen some of the chalked powder. Make sure you go all the way through and outside the other end of the barrel and THEN come back through, never pull the cleaning rod backwards inside the barrel. This causes the bore brush to scratch the inside., Apply lubricant and go in and out of the barrel until your clothes come back mostly white., Charge the charging handle to remove the dust cover on your rifle, lubricate the inside of the dust cover and the outside of the bolt. Charge the handle again to get spread the lubricant around., Remove the hand-guards and lightly lubricate the gas tube. This isn't required to be done every cleaning, but it does help.

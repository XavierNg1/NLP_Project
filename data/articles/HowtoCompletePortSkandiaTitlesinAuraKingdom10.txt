 From Witch Elena's location, head south of the map to find the Sap Barrel. Click it and you will obtain a Thick Sap. In the description, it states that you need to take the Thick Sap to Captain Brook of Skandia Town, found near the port by the stairway.
 He will tell you that he needs it to patch up his ship; give it to him to be rewarded with an Ancient Coin. The coinâ€™s description mentions about giving it to the collector.
 It's just a few steps away from the Lighthouse Manager. You will find a Collector named Justin standing by the stall.
 Justin will be surprised to find out that the coin is from a kingdom that flourished 300 years ago. He will ask you to give him the coin to him in an exchange for a good item. Justin will give you a Mysterious Crystal.
 After unsealing the crystal, the God of Destruction will appear, announcing his plan of taking over the world but quickly notice that he's far too small. Surprised about his weakened state, the God of Destruction will quickly retreat, leaving you and Elena unharmed.


After the event, you will receive another title, Vanquisher, which gives you + 10 Health Points.

 If the stain on your marble tile is oil-based, such as grease or cosmetics, you can usually remove it with a soft liquid cleanser. Use a gentle household detergent on fresh stains and ammonia or mineral spirits on older, more stubborn stains. Dilute your chosen cleanser with warm water, and use a soft cloth to apply it to the stained area. Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe the cleanser off and a clean, dry towel to dry the marble.You can use the cloth dampened with your cleansing solution to gently scrub at the stain, but don’t be too rough to avoid scratches.
 If your marble tile is stained by an organic material, such as food, coffee, or tea, hydrogen peroxide is usually the most effective cleanser. Mix 12 percent hydrogen peroxide with several drops of ammonia, and apply it to the stained tile with a cloth. Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe the hydrogen peroxide off, and thoroughly dry the surface with a soft, clean towel.You should only use hydrogen peroxide to clean your marble tile if it is a light color. Hydrogen peroxide may bleach dark marble tile.
 For stubborn or old stains, you may need a poultice, which is a thick, paste-like cleanser, to get them off your marble tile. You can buy commercially-made poultice powder that you simply combine with water. Follow the instructions to mix the paste, and apply it generously to the stain. Allow it to sit for 1 to 2 days under plastic wrap before removing the plastic and letting it dry. You can then rinse the poultice away with distilled water and buff it dry with a clean, soft cloth.You can find poultice powder at your local hardware, home improvement, or stone supply store.
When applying the poultice to the stain, the layer should be approximately ¼ to ½ inch thick.
Secure the plastic wrap over the poultice with painter’s tape to ensure that it’s airtight.

 In case the wax spills while pouring, protect your surface so that clean up is simple and easy. Dried wax is easier to clean up since the large pieces can be picked off and the residue spot-cleaned.
 Going slow and steady will prevent the wax from cracking when it settles and avoids creating air pockets within the jar., When the candle burns, the top layer of wax will melt and pool around the wick. You don't want the wax to overflow when you first start burning your candle.
 There can often be a sinkhole of wax that forms around the wick as it begins to set.Simply pour a little more wax into the sunken area and give the jar a light shake to settle the wax evenly.
 Leave about a quarter of an inch of wick above the top of the candle.If the wick is too long, will flop over and burn incorrectly. If it is too short, you will have trouble getting it to light and it may drown in the melted top layer of wax.

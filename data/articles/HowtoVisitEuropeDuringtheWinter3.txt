 When traveling to Europe, you'll need to have a passport. Depending on the country you're traveling from and how long you plan to stay, you may also need to apply for a visa. Check for the rules for your country when you're planning your trip.Keep in mind it can take a while to process your passport application, so start early.
If you plan on driving in Europe, your driver's license will need to be up to date, as well.
 In winter, flights and hotels won't be as booked up, making it easier to set off on a vacation at a moment's notice. Even booking late, it won't cost you an arm and a leg because you're traveling in the off season.In this vein, hunt around for deals. You may find a good deal that requires you to leave in a few days. Check budget traveling sites often to catch the best deals.
 Because winter is the off-season in Europe, you can get a vacation similar to what you would have taken in the summer for much cheaper, or you can upgrade your vacation for about the same amount you would've paid for a less luxurious vacation in the summer. Either way, don't be afraid to check hotels you normally wouldn't to see if they're in your price range.

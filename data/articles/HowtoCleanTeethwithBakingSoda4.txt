 Add 2-3 large strawberries (which break down plaque and remove surface stains) to a small bowl and mash them with a fork. Add 1/4 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of baking soda. Mix together thoroughly., Put the strawberry scrub onto your toothbrush. Gently apply the mixture to all of your teeth, depositing it on the surface without brushing vigorously. Leave it on for 5-10 minutes before rinsing thoroughly with water., If you are in a hurry or simply want an alternative to this scrub, simply use a strawberry covering with baking soda on your teeth. Cut off the tip of a large strawberry and dip it in baking soda. Rub it over your teeth for extra stain fighting power.

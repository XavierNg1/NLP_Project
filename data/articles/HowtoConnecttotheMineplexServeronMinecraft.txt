 Currently, you can only connect to Minecraft servers from a computer.;
, To check that you have the latest version, look at the bottom left corner of the Minecraft menu when you first open the game. Click Edit Profile, then find "Use version" in the pop-up menu and select Use Latest Version from the drop-down bar next to it.
 Log in to your profile, then select Multiplayer on the main menu.
 You will need to be connected to the internet for this next step to work.
 You can actually type anything you like into the Server Name field. Using "Mineplex" is recommended so you can easily find it on your list of servers, if you decide to add more later.
 There are two addresses for the Mineplex server. Pick the one closest to where you live:


Type in US.mineplex.com if you are in or near the United States.
Type in EU.mineplex.com if you are in or near Europe.
 You should see a new server on your list. The banner image usually says "Mineplex Games."


If there is a blank space with "cannot resolve host name," try again and make sure you type the server address correctly.
If the space says "cannot connect to server," your internet might be having trouble. Try plugging into Ethernet if you are on WiFi, or just try again later.
 Click the Mineplex server and select Join Server. You should show up in the Mineplex world almost immediately!


To get started playing games, open your inventory and click the "Items" to navigate the Mineplex menu.

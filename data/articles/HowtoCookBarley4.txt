 Follow the instructions for "Basic Barley."


Combine 1 cup (250 ml) uncooked barley with 3 cups (750 ml) water over medium-high heat.
Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the barley for 30 minutes, or until soft.
Drain, then let the barley cool to room temperature before continuing.
 Add the chopped tomatoes, chopped onion, and feta cheese. Toss well to combine.
 Place these ingredients in a separate mixing bowl. Use a whisk to mix the ingredients for one minute, or until the dressing appears evenly combined., Mix well with a spoon, making sure to coat the salad evenly with the dressing.
 For the best taste and texture, enjoy the barley salad immediately after preparing it.


You can also wait for up to two hours before serving the barley salad. Leave it out at room temperature, and serve it at room temperature.

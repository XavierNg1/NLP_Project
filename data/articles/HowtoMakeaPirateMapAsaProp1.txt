 Pirate treasure maps should seem old, if not ancient. In older times, paper was often made in more laborious ways than today, by hand. As such, it looked uneven and was often textured. If you have the time to make your own paper, this would be an excellent paper choice. Other than that, you could choose high quality, textured paper (like linen paper) or even very light card.;
, The size is completely up to you and how you wish to use it. If it's to be in a play, it'll need to be large enough for the audience to see it from a distance. If it's for decoration, it can be smaller, as people will likely move closer to peer at it. Be guided by what you intend to do with it.


Cutting the paper to size doesn't have to be perfect. Indeed, even having bits missing will add to the map's authentic appearance.

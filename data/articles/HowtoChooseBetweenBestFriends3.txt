 Even if you do choose between friends, you don’t have to cut the other friend completely out of your life. Continue to see your other friend, and let them know you’re still there for them. Meet for a weekly coffee or send an occasional text to check in.

Don’t try to hang out with the other friend in secret, or when you think no one else will find out. Be honest about who you’re spending your time with., While the situation may seem like the most important thing to you or your friends, don’t let it consume your life. It’s important to focus on other things after you’ve made your decision.If your friends try to bring it up again, listen to what they have to say for a couple of minutes, then change the subject.
 Think about what caused the rift between your two friends to start with -- was it gossip? Disloyalty? Look at what happened as a growing experience as you move forward with future friendships.

 This method requires using gobs of old nail polish and you don't want to waste your favorite color. Any old nail polish you don't use much anymore is fair game; just make sure it hasn't dried out. It should still be fresh and smooth.
 Paint a liberal amount of polish, making sure you completely cover the old nail polish. Try not to get too much of the polish on your fingers; just paint a healthy amount on your nail directly over the old polish.
 When you wipe off the new wet coat, scrub your nail with the paper towel so the old coat comes off with it. Rub with clean sections of the paper towel until both the new and old nail polish are gone.





Act quickly - if you wait more than five seconds, the new coat of nail polish might start to dry.
You may have to repeat this more than once to completely remove the old nail polish.
 Continue the process with each nail until all the old nail polish has been removed. Wash your hands with warm, soapy water to help remove the last bits of remaining color.

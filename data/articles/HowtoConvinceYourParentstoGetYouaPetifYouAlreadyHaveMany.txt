 Although this is a given, you must be prepared to show off in front of your parents and impress them with your extensive knowledge. Not to mention, if you give improper care to your pet, it will be unhappy and mean. This won't make anyone happy.;
, Also, be sure to say anything that will indicate that the pets you already have will not affect your new furry-or feathered- friend.

Cats are a very controversial topic, especially if you're getting a smaller pet. If you have a cat, try to convince your peers that your new pet will be far from danger.
If you're asking for a bigger pet, such as a dog, try to come up with strategies to prevent conflict between the two.
 Make some kind of deal with with your parents; for example, if you keep your room clean and do all the things a perfect angel child will do, they'll consider getting you a pet. #*Never explicitly say, "Get me a pet." It's everything that you'll do stacked up on top of each other that'll help convince a parent.
 If your parents have to fork over $200 to buy you a pet, that is almost a guarantee you will get a no. Save up--if you aren't willing to spend some cash on your friend, maybe you shouldn't have him/her after all.
 If your parent has a serious reason that you can't get a pet, like if you want a dog, but you already own one that hates other dogs, and for some reason you can't separate them, then try suggesting another pet, like a ferret, hedgehog, or hamster.

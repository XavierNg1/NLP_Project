 Press down ten times on the corner of your nose, pressure very gently to keep your nose from getting worse.It is believed that this pressure point can help alleviate sinus congestion and headaches that result from colds and allergies.Your nose should be almost closed each time you apply pressure to the area.


Repeat on the area just above your eyes, applying mild pressure.Repeat 10 times on each side of your face.
 Repeat on both sides.
 Use salt water to flush out the nasal passages, freeing up mucus and other debris.You can either use a syringe, neti pot, or other product designed for nasal irrigation.The first thing to stop or prevent a runny nose is to irrigate and remove pollen, dust or pus from nasal passages. Use distilled water with a neti pot and sinus rinse that washes saltwater in one nostril and it comes out the other nostril. The rinse is approximately 240 milliliters (8.1  fl oz) of distilled water with mixed salt and baking soda to pH balance for comfort. Runny noses can irritate mucous and cause a bloody nose. This rinse can dry out mucous and might lead to epistaxis (bloody noses). To moisturize the nose, a half teaspoon of Glycerin 99.5% Anhydrous from the first aid department of a pharmacy can also be added to the nasal rinse. Glycerin is moisturizing and forms a barrier so pollen and dust will not come in contact with mucous membranes. A saltwater nasal rinse also helps a bloody nose to stop bleeding. Be careful not to inhale the water.
 Runny noses result when you have excess mucus and fluid buildup in your nose and throat.The best way to treat a runny nose is to get the excess fluid out. Blow your nose gently, using a soft tissue to avoid skin irritation. Don't blow too often, as it could cause skin burning and redness.
 Soak a hand towel in hot water and place it on your face. This will help alleviate sinus pressure and open up the nasal passages.

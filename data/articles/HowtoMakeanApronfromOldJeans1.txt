 You should choose jeans that currently fit you, because you will be using the waistband and button.;
, Use sharp fabric scissors. You should be cutting through the inseam, so that your apron will be straight at the bottom.
 You will need to do this on both sides. Cut along the side seams and discard the front piece.


If you want to sew a hem on the jeans, cut 2 or 3 (5 to 7.6 cm) inches below the inseam. You will need to fold up and pin the hem.
If you do want to sew the bottom edge, you should cut 2 or 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) below the inseam on the back. You will need to fold up and pin the hem. Sew along the bottom and back stitch on the ends. If you do not sew the bottom, it will gently fray over time as you wash it.
 Button the apron in back. Place cooking, gardening or craft supplies in the pockets.


You can embellish your apron by sewing ribbons around the pockets or waistband. Pin the ribbons in place and sew them with a sewing machine or by hand.

, Save the image to your desktop with the name "tdsb.jpg".
 In the run textbox, type %systemroot% and hit enter. If the computer is running Windows 7, just open the start menu and type %systemroot% into the search bar at the bottom. If for some reason you do not have access to the "run" feature, simply open up any explorer window (Ex. Home Drive) and type %systemroot% into the address bar.
 When you are at systemroot (It will appear as "C:\Windows"), you will have to search for a file named tdsb.jpg. When you find it, replace it with your version of tdsb.jpg. If you cannot find tdsb.jpg, just drag your tdsb.jpg version into the folder and it will still work.
 You have a new desktop wallpaper!

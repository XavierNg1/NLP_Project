 In the spring, look to gardens and other venues with flowers and greenery that showcases the beauty of the season. Try a botanical garden, zoo, or public park. In the city, find budding trees or other spots of green to highlight the season, even if the focus is on you near a favorite landmark.If you have a favorite location, take some shots outside to take advantage of the spring weather. For example, if you love the theater, stand near the marquee on the street.
 Go to the beach or a lake, especially if you love being on the water together. Try shooting some photos in a boat or barefoot on the sand. Take advantage of the spring weather being cool enough that beaches and lakes won’t be overcrowded.
 Use the new growth in these locations to add interest and a springtime look to your photos. For example, take some photos with young farm animals in the background to symbolize spring and new growth. Pose around some lush vines at your local vineyard, especially if you love wine.
 Take the photos at home, where you’re most comfortable. You’ll look your best in your comfort zone. Pick a sunny location to highlight the beauty of spring. Also emphasize the season by posing on your front porch, balcony, or in your garden.

 Once you have introduced the quote in your paper properly, read it out loud to confirm it flows with the rest of the content. Check that the sentence fits within the rest of the paragraph. Make sure you include your own thoughts and ideas about the quote in the paragraph so it feels essential to what you are talking about.


You can also look at your use of quotes throughout the paper to confirm they flow well. Make sure you are consistent with how you introduce quotes in the paper. Use one to two different ways to introduce quotes and stick to them so the reader can follow your train of thought.
 Read over each lead-in to make sure you are using punctuation properly. Check that commas are placed in the lead-in. Make sure you do not use commas if the lead-in ends with “that” or “as.”


You should also check that you italicize any titles in the lead-in. Capitalize any author names or titles in the lead-in, as well.
 Whenever you use quotes in a paper or essay, you need to cite them properly so you are not liable for plagiarism. Always follow the citation style assigned by your instructor. They may prefer APA style, MLA style, or Chicago Style citations.


Place the citation at the end of the quote, if you are using in quote citations.
For example, you may write:

Arendt does not see totalitarianism as a positive result of war: “Totalitarianism is to be feared and loathed” (On Totalitarianism, 54).
Hamlet is doubtful of Rosencrantz’s view, claiming he could be “bounded in a nutshell” and still feel powerful, “a king of infinite space” (Hamlet, 2.2).

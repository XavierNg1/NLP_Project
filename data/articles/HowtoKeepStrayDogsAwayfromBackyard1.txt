 A sure way to attract stray dogs to your yard is to leave your own pets’ food outside where strays can smell and get to it. Most strays will be hungry and looking for food. If you feed your pets outside, make sure you bring leftover food in to the house once your pets are finished.;
, Strays might also look for food by digging through your trash. Bag all of the trash that you take outside and make sure your garbage cans’ lids are replaced tightly after you put bags of trash in them.


Garbage cans that have locking handles are probably your best bet, because they also prevent strays from trying to pop off garbage can lids that are less secure.
 Dogs dislike the smell of marigolds, so planting some in your yard or garden can encourage strays to stay away from your yard. Marigolds also repel certain types of bugs and pests, so planting them can pull the double duty of repelling stray dogs as well as other critters.

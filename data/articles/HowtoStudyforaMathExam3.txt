 Start preparing for the test on day one of the unit. Each night after class, look over your notes from that session. Cramming the night before will just overwhelm you.If you give yourself time to study gradually, you’ll have a better shot at mastering the material. In addition, you’ll be able to identify weak spots and, if necessary, get extra help.
 Most classes have assigned, or at least suggested, problems that the teacher feels are most useful. Exam problems are often similar to homework problems, so doing your daily homework is like taking a little practice test each day.If your textbook provides answers in the back of the book, use them only to check your work. If you choose to use them, try not to peek until after you've finished the assignment!
Do all the work for each equation, and keep your homework papers. Use them to study as the test approaches. Never just copy someone else’s homework.
 It’s typically more useful to understand how a formula is derived than simply memorizing it. Memorization is a good first step, but getting a feel for why a formula works by doing plenty of practice problems will increase your shot at passing with flying colors.For example, you could simply memorize the sum of a triangle's interior angles, which always add up to 180 degrees. However, if you really get a feel for that formula, you could use it to solve other problems, like figuring out an unknown angle in a hexagon.

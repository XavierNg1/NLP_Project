 You get to spin the bonus wheel the first time that you log in each day. Even if you're not going to be playing long, try to log in at least for a minute so that you can spin the wheel.;
, Free players get to spin the silver wheel once per day. If you have a VIP membership, you can spin the gold wheel as well, earning even more StarCoins. VIPs can also spin the wheel more than once a day.
 When the wheel stops spinning, your StarCoins will come bouncing out. Move your mouse over each one to collect it.
 You can spend a Diamond to spin the wheel again. You may want to save your Diamonds for other purchases instead, due to the possibility that you won't get many StarCoins from your spin.

Put one end of the fishing line (end A) through the round hole at the top of the hook. Pull the same end back through the hole but be sure to not pull it all the way. You should have a loop on one side of the hole and the two ends of the line on the other.
Create circle by bringing the loop over and forming a loop on top of the two ends. Wrap the end of the loop through the hole created but do not pull it tight yet.
Pull the hook through the end of the loop (which should be rather small now.) Pull the hook and ends of the line in opposite directions so that the knot is tightened. Cut off the end of the line that is not connected to the fishing pole.









Lay the ends of the string so that the ends lie parallel to each other. They should run parallel for about four inches (10 cm).
Pull the end of the right chord (end A) so that it doubles back four inches (10 cm). It should make a long C shape. Hold the chord down and loop the same end back four inches (10 cm) leaving some chord at the end of end A (you will need it to finish the knot.)
Wrap end A around all of the stacked up lengths of switch-backing chord. Wrap the end from front to back several times. Feed end A through the loop.
Slide the wrapped loops down so that the knot is tightened. End B (the left end) should be able to move freely when pulled. Make another of these knots if you wish.









Take a rope and fold it in half. Take the loop made in the middle and wrap it around a pole from the back of the pole to the front. The left side of the rope will be the quick-release end (end A) and the right side of the rope with be the standing end (end B).
Make a loop (loop 1) using end B. Pull that loop through the original loop that is wrapped over the pole.
Make a loop (loop 2) using end A. Pull loop 2 through loop 1. Pull down on end B to tighten the hitch. Pull end A for the quick-release.

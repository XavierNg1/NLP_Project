 Put the butter into a mixing bowl, and beat it with a handheld mixer. If you have a food processor with a whisk attachment, use that instead.;
, If you'd like a smoother frosting, omit the lemon zest. If you'd like a less sweet frosting, omit the vanilla extract.
 Use medium speed, and keep beating until the mixture becomes smooth. From time to time, scrape the sides of the bowl so that everything mixes evenly., If the frosting is too dry, add a little more lemon juice or milk. If the frosting is too wet, add a little more sugar. At this point, you can also add a few drops of yellow food coloring to make your frosting more lemon-colored.
 If you won't be using the icing for a while, keep it covered with a damp cloth in the fridge, and re-whip it before you spread it.If it is too dry, then add a little more lemon juice or milk.

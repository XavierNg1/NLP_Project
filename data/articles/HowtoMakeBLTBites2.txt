 For the BLT Bites, you’ll need 3 to 4 slices of cooked bacon. Use a sharp knife to chop the bacon into 1-inch (2.5-cm) squares.If you’re in a hurry, you can purchase precooked bacon at the grocery store. You heat and crisp it up in your microwave according to the package instructions, so you don’t have to fry it yourself.
 For the lettuce in the BLT bites, you’ll need 1 cup (75 grams) from a bag of spring salad mix. Use a sharp knife to chop the greens into bite-size pieces, and mix it in a medium bowl with 3 teaspoons (15 g) of mayonnaise until all of the lettuce is coated.You can use any lettuce or greens that you like for the BLT bites. Premixed salad bags are usually easier to work with than a head of lettuce.
If you find that there isn’t enough mayonnaise to coat all of the greens, you can add more. Just mix it in small amounts so you don’t accidentally add too much.
 After the greens are coated with the mayonnaise, add the mixture to 12 round crackers. Use a teaspoon (5 g) to carefully place the salad mixture on the crackers so there’s a single, neat layer.You can use any type of cracker that you like for the BLT Bites. A bacon-flavored variety is an ideal option, though.
 With the salad mixture on the crackers, add the bacon and tomato layers. Place one of the bacon squares on each cracker, and use a slice from 3 to 4 grape tomatoes to cover each piece of bacon. Place the bites on a platter, and serve.

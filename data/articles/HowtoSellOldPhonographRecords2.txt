 It is far more likely that you will pack and ship without ever having met the buyer. Using an online 'bank' such as PayPal is worth the small fee per transaction since you can then accept major credit cards or e-checks, and if you choose, shipping charges are included in the original electronically created and automatically emailed invoice. Shipment is not made until payment is received in full, which is normally only a matter of minutes., By requiring that shipping insurance be purchased along with regular postal charges, the shipper is reimbursed for lost or damaged records, and then can reimburse the buyer their payment. Sellers are not liable for damaged or lost freight if the item is properly packaged, insured and has delivery confirmation requested. Today, it's normal for buyers to pay for all actual postage costs and reasonable handling fees. Do not ever send any item by C.O.D. Today many sellers do not offer refunds if they have completely and honestly described all flaws on the record and/or cover, and properly packaged and shipped the item. Some sellers offer 3 to 30 day refund periods, but may only offer a trade for like item or credit with seller.

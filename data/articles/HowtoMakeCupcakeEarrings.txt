 See the "Things You'll Need" list below. Choose which colors you want to use for the earrings. For the earrings shown in this how-to, a brown clay was used for the cupcake base and a white clay for the whipped cream.;
, Make them as big or as little as you want.
 These should mimic the little ridges often seen on cupcake cups.


If everything turns out okay, you should have something like the picture on the right. Make as many or as few indents as you'd like.
 You will use this to make the whipped cream on top of the cupcake. Start on the outside rim of the cupcake and curl the string up and around until you reach the center; try to get it to look like the whipped cream on the cupcakes shown. Repeat for the other cupcake.


Don't fuss over this. Real whipped cream doesn't always look perfect when you spray it on a cupcake - and little imperfections give your earrings character.
 They should be long enough to go from the top to the bottom of the cupcakes while still leaving a little loop on top.
, Lay a cookie sheet on an oven tray, place the cupcakes on it and then bake according to the instructions on the polymer clay package.


After the cupcakes have finished baking, remove from the oven and let them cool.
After they have cooled, apply a small amount of heavy-duty craft glue where the wire meets the clay. Otherwise the cupcake charms will fall off after a few wears. You can glaze them to give them a shiny finish.

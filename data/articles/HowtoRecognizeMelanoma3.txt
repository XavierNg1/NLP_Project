 The ugly duckling method is especially useful for people who have a lot of moles, particularly if some of those moles are benign irregular moles. Because melanomas look different from regular moles, compare all of your moles to each other. Any mole that looks different from the rest is suspicious and needs to be checked.Consider the size and shape of your moles to see if one is bigger or smaller. The suspicious mole should stand out in appearance from the others.
Look at the color of your moles to check for an odd one. For example, if all of your moles are dark brown, but a light brown mole has appeared, then get that one checked out.
A suspicious mole may have more than one color and up to three, brown, light brown and purplish.
 Anytime you get a new mole or lesion, have it checked out. Sometimes a new mole is benign, but it’s also a risk factor for melanomas.

New moles or lesions are more questionable if you don’t have many moles. People with few moles are less likely to develop a new one that is benign.
New moles can be more questionable in elderly people., Symptomatic moles have issues that are atypical of normal moles, such as bleeding, itching, or hurting. If you have one mole that starts to show symptoms, make an appointment to get it checked.

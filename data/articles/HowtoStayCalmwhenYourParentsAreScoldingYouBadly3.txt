 Physical abuse is not discipline. It is a way for a parent to assert their dominance over a child or teen and instill fear. This is usually done out of anger and frustration.You can recognize physical abuse easily because it is any physical contact (e.g., hitting, biting, pushing, etc.) that causes physical injury or pain.Keep in mind that certain physical punishments are not considered abuse. For example, some parents spank their children as a way to punish them.
 Scolding is a form of discipline that can be used to verbally point out when a child does something wrong. This can be taken to an abusive extreme in some cases. Emotional abuse is present when a parent constantly belittles or shames a child. This impacts the child’s self-esteem and can damage future relationships and create lasting psychological problems for the child.For example, it would be reasonable for your parents to scold you if you ran up a huge bill on your cell phone. However, it would not be appropriate for them to call you names or to accuse you of being the source of their financial problems.
 Sexual abuse is any sexual contact between a person under eighteen and a person over eighteen, or between a much younger child and much older child. If there is any sexual aspect to the “scolding” or “punishment” this is sexual abuse. You should seek help right away.For example, if your parent touches you in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable, then this might be considered sexual abuse.

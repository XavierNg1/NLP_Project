 Honey is a natural antiseptic and has also been shown to suppress a cough. Take one or two spoonfuls of honey and swallow slowly, allowing it to sit at the back of your mouth for as long as possible.Honey can also be added to hot water to create a soothing drink, though this is usually less effective in the long-term.
Children under 1 year should NOT be given honey. It contains bacteria that their bodies cannot process.;
, Add 1 spoonful of sea salt or 2 spoonfuls of table salt to a glass of warm water. Gargle with a mouthful of the solution at a time until it is gone. This sanitizes your throat and reduces inflammation, in turn reducing pain. You can also gargle an apple cider vinegar solution. It works in much the same way. Add one or two spoonfuls of apple cider vinegar to a glass of water and gargle the solution. Honey can also be added to improve the taste, though it won't taste fantastic no matter what and isn't intended to.
 You can take a hot shower, use a humidifier, or stand over a boiling tea kettle. Breathing the steam will soothe your throat, as dry air is very painful on your throat., Try eating foods like broth, soup, warm applesauce, or soft fruits (though you should avoid foods with too much sugar). These can reduce pain.


Try washing, separating and freezing blue berries, canned oranges, or similar small fruits. Suck on these once frozen to reduce the pain.
 Drink some warm tea like Throat Coat Tea with honey.
 Suck on a cough drop to relieve soreness.

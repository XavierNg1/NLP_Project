 Wash, condition, and shampoo it. This style will be easiest if your hair is relatively straight, and all the same length. If you have curly or layered hair, it may be difficult. Make a part in your hair at the place where you want the braid to start.


Don't worry about making a part if you have bangs., If you want the braid to go left, take a section of hair starting at the left of your part, and vice versa. Split this section in two, so that you have one section on your hairline, and the other just behind it.


If you have bangs, separate a section of hair just behind them, about an inch up from your ear.
 Rotate them around each other so that they switch places. The section whose roots are closest to your face should now be laying across the section whose roots are closest to the back of your head., While holding the two twisted sections with one hand, use the other hand to pick up another small section of hair from the top of your head. Lay it between the two twisted sections, and let it hang there.
 This should twist them around the strand you just inserted between them, holding it in place. This is the basic step you will need to repeat to achieve this braid.
 Pull another small section of hair from the top of your head, and lay it between the twisted strands just like last time. Twist the sections again, lay another section between them, twist again, and so on. Use a couple bobby pins to secure it when youâ€™ve reached the desired length.


Be sure to twist the strands in the same direction each time.

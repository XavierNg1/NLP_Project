 Ordinary loose paper or construction paper will do. We will make a square piece of paper from this. If you're already starting with a square piece of origami paper, skip the next two steps.






;
, Fold the top right hand corner diagonally down so the top of the paper lines up with the left side, forming a point at the top right corner.
 Cut or carefully tear along the edge so you are left with a square of paper.
 The fold should be parallel to the edges.
 Cut the square in half into 2 equal parts. Scissors may make this easier.
 Fold each piece in half vertically again, parallel to the long sides.
 Fold the end diagonally, so the edges line up.
 Repeat this fold, on each end of each strip, making sure the folds are oriented as shown.
 Fold the end on the diagonal again. You should end with a big triangle facing you and two smaller triangles facing away from you.
 Repeat this same fold on each end of each strip. Make sure the orientations go opposite one another, as shown.
, There should be a square in the center of each piece that lines up, but if you can't find it yet, don't worry. Just line up the middles.
,,,, You may have to coax a little to get it tucked in.
 This will keep the ninja star from becoming undone.

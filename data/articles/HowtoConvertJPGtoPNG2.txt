 There are a variety of free online conversion services that will convert your image files for you. This is especially useful if you are using a computer without any image editing software accessible. Popular services include:


Zamzar
Online-Convert
Picture Resize

, The process will vary depending on the service you are using, but generally you will be able to upload any JPG image from your computer. Some services allow you to insert the URL for images on the web instead of uploading them.


Make sure you are comfortable uploading your image to these servers. While most have a privacy policy in place to protect you, trust is an important factor. If the images are a security risk or highly personal, you may want to convert them using another method.
You may be required to enter your email address in order to receive the converted file.
Since some services are designed for multiple formats, make sure you have PNG selected as the format when you upload your JPG file.
 Some services will convert as soon as you upload, while others will require you to click a Convert button. The conversion process may take a few moments to a few minutes. After the conversion is complete, you will either be given a download link for the converted file, or it will be emailed to you as an attachment.

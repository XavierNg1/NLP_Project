 As Theda lived a long time ago, it is not possible to know exactly what she wore when she was dressed casually. However, her formal wear still exists in pictures, where she is often shown wearing very loose low-necked, shapeless dresses. To emulate this, wear loose maxi dresses made from silk fabric or choose flowing dresses of any fabric type.;
, Alternatively, use large and pretty tiaras. You can make your own jewel-covered headband by adding faux jewels to a classy headband.
 Flat, dainty shoes are perfect. If you like heels, look for 1920s style heels, as they're quite different from those worn nowadays.
 Keep the appearance as smooth as possible, to minimize any wrinkles.
 Spread it down a couple of centimeters under your eyes. Also keep your eyelashes thick and dark, and apply some mascara.
,, Theda usually had a deep wistful staring look. Get a picture of her and mimic her look in a mirror. Don't try to look like her, as this isn't about exact appearance; instead, seek to present the same expression, but in your own way.
 Theda often walked around slowly in a seductive way.

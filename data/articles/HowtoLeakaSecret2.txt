 One mistake that’s easy to make is sending original documents that could be easily tracked. If you have documents on a computer, take a screenshot and make it into a separate document. Send this document so the original doesn’t create a trail., If you send an email to a news outlet’s general email account, it will be easily tracked. Make sure that the outlet has a system in place to protect both of you from detection. SecureDrop and GlobaLeak are commonly used secure platforms., After you have leaked the secret documents through a secure source, close any windows you’ve used. Open the settings on your browser. Clear the cookies, and any other data that your browser is set to save. Then turn off the wifi.
 If your laptop is on, it can be tracked. Since you leaked the secret from a public place, turn the laptop off while you are still there. Make sure you wait and check that it’s completely shut down before you leave.

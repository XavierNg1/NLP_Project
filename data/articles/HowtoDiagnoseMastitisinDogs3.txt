 If your dog has mastitis, there are treatments available to cure it. The most common treatment is antibiotics to kill the bacteria. When the mastitis is too severe, the mammary glands may need to be surgically drained. If the glands get infected often, the dog may have to have their mammary glands removed.If the dog is ill or septic, they may need an IV.
You may need to place a warm compress on the swollen glands to help reduce pain and help the milk flow better.
 Measures can be taken to prevent mastitis if your dog has just given birth. Make sure to keep your dog and the puppies clean. Trim the hair around the dog's mammary glands and wipe away any dirt, debris, or urine from that area. You should also clean the puppies' litter area.Make sure the puppies don't scratch the mammary glands with their nails. Clip their nails if possible.
Make sure each mammary gland is expelling milk. If the puppies aren't using each teat, manually squeeze milk from them to clear bacteria and help milk not to get backed up.
 Some risk factors may lead to mastitis in dogs. The condition is most commonly seen in female dogs who are lactating. Trauma to the mammary glands can lead to mastitis. Trauma can come from nursing puppies who bite the teat or scratch it. Trauma may also occur if the dog has short legs and the teats drag along the ground and get scratched or damaged.Poor hygiene around the mammary glands may also cause the bacterial infection.
It may also occur due to the infection spreading through the blood.
 Mastitis is an infection of the mammary glands caused by bacteria. It leads to inflammation. The infection usually starts at the opening of the teat. It can occur in one or multiple mammary glands.

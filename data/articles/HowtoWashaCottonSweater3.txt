 If your sweaterâ€™s care tag advises that you hand-wash the sweater, it is best to follow that advice. Also, you can hand-wash the sweater if your washing machine does not have a delicate cycle. To do so, fill a sink or tub with cool water, pour in laundry detergent, place the clothes in the sink or tub, and allow them to soak. Gently knead the clothes for a moment or two, and then rinse until the water runs clear.


Hand-washing can help extend the life and quality of your sweater because it is more gentle than machine-washing.
 Your sweater will be less likely to wear or pill if it is inside out when you put it in the washing machine. Simply stick your hand inside the sweater and gently pull the sleeves to turn it inside out.
 This can help protect your sweater from damage that may occur in the washing machine. Simply take a clean pillowcase with a zipper and place your sweater inside. Then, place the pillowcase in the washing machine, choose the delicate cycle, and wash the sweater.

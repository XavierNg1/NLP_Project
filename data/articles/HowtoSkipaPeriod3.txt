 For regular use, you would leave the NuvaRing in for three weeks, then remove it for one week before inserting the new ring. If you are using your ring to skip a period, you can leave it in for up to four weeks before starting a new ring., At the end of the four weeks, remove the NuvaRing and replace it with a fresh ring. This will re-dose your body with hormones, effectively skipping your period.The regular ring cycle ends after three weeks. You may leave it in for the fourth week, or you can remove it and replace it immediately with a fresh ring.
 If you've been using a NuvaRing for three or more weeks, simply remove it for four days to get your period again. After four days, put in a new ring to resume your cycle.

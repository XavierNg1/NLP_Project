 Dead spots in your lawn caused by animal urine will be round, and generally all in a single area of your yard. The individual spots may range in diameter from a few inches to over a foot. Dogs especially tend to habitually urinate in a single area.Animal urine is not the only agent that can cause lawn damage and dead, brown spots of grass. Various lawn diseases and insect problems can cause similar looking spots, but will need to be treated by lawn professionals.;
, Make sure to put on a pair of gardening gloves before touching the grass. In order to determine if the dead grass spot(s) are caused by an animal’s urine, you’ll need to grasp the dead grass firmly. Then give it a sharp tug; if the roots of the grass hold, it’s probably caused by urine. If you can easily pull the roots from the soil, you’re more likely dealing with a grub problem.If you suspect that you have a grub infestation in your lawn or that your lawn has a disease, contact a landscaping company or a lawn-care business for assistance.

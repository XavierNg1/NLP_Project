 As your hair transitions from a bob to a lob, or long bob, it is important that you continue to visit your hairdresser for frequent trims. Every six to eight weeks, ask your stylist to take off Â¼ inch of hair. This will remove the split ends and keep your hair looking healthy as it grows out., If your hair is very thick, your bob may require additional maintenance. As your thick hair grows, the base of your bob may widen. In the hair industry, this is called the mushroom-effect. To avoid this, ask your stylist to thin just the ends of your hair with a razor., As soon as your hair hits your shoulders, the ends will flip out in an unflattering way. Until your hair grows past your shoulders, you should do your best to keep the ends off your collar bone. To achieve this, consider applying one or more of the following methods:


Curl your hair with a 1 inch barrel to shorten the strands slightly
Add beach waves and texture to your hair to shorten the strands
Add volume to your roots to lift the hair off your shoulders.

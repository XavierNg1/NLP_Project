 Put the saucepan/pot over a stove burner set to medium or high heat. Put the butter in the pot when hot and let it turn brown. Add the onion slices to cook for about five minutes. Stir in the garlic afterwards.;
, Stir in the pumpkin and chicken stock after the onions have shown a slight brown. Bring the pot to a boil, then simmer it for 20 to 30 minutes.
, Lightly sprinkle cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar onto the croûtons. Then lightly drizzle the olive oil onto the croûtons.
 Bake for seven minutes. Take the tray back out when the croûtons have a brown and crispy look.
 Stir and take off the heat.
 Drain water back in the pan as you scoop. Before blending, release the steam/heat from the soup. Pulse the soup about two or three times before blending for 30 seconds. Add one tablespoon of crème fraiche and blend again. Pour the blended soup into another saucepan. Repeat the blending process with the rest of the soup.
 Add a little garnish, such as mint.

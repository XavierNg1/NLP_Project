 Police officers are now using the internet to aid in their duties. Police are using social media outlets to let citizens know about crimes in progress, to inform citizens of events, and to post pictures of suspects and wanted criminals., If someone reaches out to you online claiming they are a police officer, you should immediately be concerned. While police often use social media, they are usually using it to reach the masses and not one individual person. When someone reaches out to you, look at their profile and analyze their personal information.A real police officer will have no problem stating who they work for and where they work. On the other hand, an impersonator will often try to hide their true identity. Therefore, an impersonator may hide their employment credentials, which should be a red flag for you.
 An official police or police officer internet page will often include the official's head shot or the official insignia of the police force. Profile pictures depicting eagles, flags, or other symbols instead of the person's photo should raise alarms.If photo albums do not contain any real pictures, it might be the profile of an impersonator., When you start conversing online with someone claiming to be a police officer, ask for their credentials. A real officer will have no problem providing you with a badge number, name, identification number, and information about the precinct they work for. Once you receive this information, call the police station and ask to verify what you have been told.


If the person you are talking to is unable to provide you with their credentials, you should cease talking to them and contact the police.

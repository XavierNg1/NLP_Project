 This kitchen tool can pit olives using the following procedure.


Place the olive securely inside the small bowl at the end of the olive pitter.
Squeeze on the handles at the other end. This punches a small hole at the end of the olive.
Continue to squeeze the handles until the pit is forced out of the punched hole and drops to the bottom of the bowl.
Release the handle to drop the loose fruit into a separate bowl and discard the pit that is left behind.

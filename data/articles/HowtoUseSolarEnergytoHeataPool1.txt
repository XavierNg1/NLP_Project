 The longer it takes for water to make its way through the hose and into your pool, the warmer that water will be. While fifty feet of hose is generally sufficient, additional length means the water will have even more time to warm up. The added surface area of the hose collects more heat, as well. If you use a dark-colored hose, the water can get even warmer because dark colors absorb more solar energy.A black rubber hose is ideal and relatively inexpensive. You can also use a black garden irrigation pipe, because it’s thin walls allow for a faster heat transfer. While it is inexpensive, it will also kink easily.
Both of these are available in most home supply stores.;
, Point the hose directly towards the sun or mount your hose on a board that can be angled toward the sun for even more exposure.


You may want to consider mounting the hose on a board and attach it to a sun-facing roof. This is not recommended unless you have a suitable low roof, such a shed, or are skilled at working at roof height.
 Use a hose that is ⅝ or ½ inch in diameter to slowly fill the pool. Try keeping the stream around half an inch in diameter to allow it to take in heat while still filling the pool at a decent rate.


Always fill up your pool on a sunny day to take the most advantage of the sun’s energy.

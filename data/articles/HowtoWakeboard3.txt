 Your toes should face away from the wake.
 Cut in at a gentle angle at first, and then cut in harder as you get closer to the peak of the wake.
 Extend your knees and stand tall as you ride up the peak of the wake, and keep the rope taut. You'll fly up over the edge of the wake and catch air at that point. Draw the board up toward yourself while you're in the air to stay up longer., Place your weight over your toes so that you have maximum control of your landing.

 During this time of both caring for your child and managing your work as a student, be sure to set a schedule for yourself. This will help ensure that both you and your baby are adjusted to the college life. Plan for a set time each day to study, exercise, eat, sleep, go to class, and to drop off/pick up your child., Many universities offer housing options for families or students with children, as you cannot live in a dorm room with a baby. Look into these options at your school. In addition, if you prefer to live off campus, you can find some apartments nearby that are in your price range and are kid friendly.
 Though it can be tempting to clean or work while your baby is sleeping, this can be damaging to your health. When your baby sleeps, you should sleep as well. You do not need as much sleep as your child does, so get the seven or eight hours that you need, and then get up and do whatever work you need to do.If you donâ€™t sleep when the baby does, you might find yourself pulling an unwanted all-nighter, as your child might stay up through the night leaving you having gotten no sleep.
 Make the most of every moment that you have away from your child. Study on the bus or in between your classes or during any spare moment you get during the day. Even 5-10 minutes can make the difference between passing a test or failing.

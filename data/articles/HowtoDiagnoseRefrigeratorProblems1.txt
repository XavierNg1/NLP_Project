 Pull out the refrigerator if needed and press the plug firmly into the outlet. Check your appliance's electrical cord for damage. Any exposed wire, kinks or cuts in the cord might make the appliance malfunction. If this is the case, do not use the cord and contact a repairman.;
, The extension cord may be damaged or faulty. Plug the refrigerator directly into the outlet. If this solves the problem, replace the faulty extension cord., Plug the other appliance into the same outlet that your refrigerator was plugged into. If that appliance also does not work, check your fuse or circuit breaker box. You might have a blown fuse or tripped breaker.
 If this solves the problem, then the problem is with the outlet. Check the current and voltage of the outlet with a multimeter and voltage tester. If you do not know how to work these tools, contact a professional repair technician or electrician.
 This may reset the circuit board (like rebooting a computer or a cell phone). By leaving it unplugged, you allow capacitors to lose any charge they may be holding.

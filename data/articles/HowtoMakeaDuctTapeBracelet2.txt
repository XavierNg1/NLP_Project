 Choose two different colors or patterns for this style of bracelet.


If you use transparent duct tape, you can insert small images or decorations inside the tape before folding it over. This could create an unique bracelet to include such items as letters to spell a name or word, tiny images, buttons, lace pieces, flat costume gems, or glitter., Measure one piece of duct tape long enough to fit your wrist. An easy way to measure is to wrap the non-sticky side around your wrist, leaving around an inch of space (2.5cm).
 Make sure you cut the length with a little overlap in case it’s too small. The length should be adequate to allow you to slip the bracelet on and off., Fold the length of the duct tape in half so the adhesive side sticks together.
 Using the same length as the first piece, cut off another strip of duct tape. Fold it lengthwise as you did in the previous step.
 Use double sided tape or a glue to stick the tape together. Use up any extra length at the end to ensure a perfect fit. Trim any edges.


Ensure that the tapes line up together so that there isn’t any overlap., Fasten the ends with fastening tape or velcro. Velcro spots are ideal for an easy removal. Enjoy your reversible duct tape bracelet!

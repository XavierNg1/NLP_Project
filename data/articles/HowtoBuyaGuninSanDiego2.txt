 The firearms dealer will need verification that you qualify to buy a gun.


Bring your HSC, your California drivers license or identification card, and an additional document that proves your California residency; such as a utility bill, lease agreement, or property deed.
 Upon selecting your gun, the firearms dealer will verify your documents and begin the DROS process.
 The DROS process requires you to wait at least 10 days before you can take your handgun home. You will then be required to demonstrate to the dealer that you can safely operate the handgun you purchased.


In some cases, dealers will allow you to perform the handgun safe-handling demonstration at the time of your initial visit to buy the handgun.






If you do not revisit the firearms dealership within 30 days of the initiation of the DROS process, you will have to restart the gun purchase and DROS procedure, which will require you to wait another 10 days for the handgun.

 For example, if you want to delete all mail from three months ago and later, you would use three months before today's date as your cut-off date.
 It's at the top of the Gmail page.
 Exclude the quotes.


For example, you might type "in:inbox before:2016/07/08" to view all mail from before July 8th, 2016.
 You can find this in the top left corner of your inbox, directly beneath the search bar.
 This option is to the right of the "All (number) conversations on this page are selected" text at the top of your inbox.
 You can find it in the toolbar at the top of the page.
 This is in the options tree on the left side of the screen.
 Your inbox should now be devoid of emails before your selected date.


If you choose not to empty the trash now, your emails will stay there for 30 days before being automatically deleted.

 As you drain, make sure to clean up any debris as you go. If your pool has an autofill, you should make sure that you turn it off during the drain. Once your pool is completely empty, start the acid-wash process.;
,, Acid must be added to the water and not the other way around.
 The hose should not have a nozzle and water should be running from the hose at all times.
 During this time, you should be scrubbing the wall with a brush.
 Before moving to the next section, make sure you rinse the wall well so the acid doesn't continue to eat the plaster.
 The acid-washing process leaves a foamy puddle of residue on the bottom of the pool that must be removed before it damages the plaster.


Apply soda ash to the acid puddle, scrubbing the mixture with a pool brush. You will need to use 2 lb. (.9 kg) of soda ash per 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of acid.
Pump the mixture into a bowl using a submersible pump.
Dispose of what you pumped, as the acid can kill frogs, fish and plants. Rinse out the bowl.
Pour water over any remaining residue, rinsing carefully around the drain.

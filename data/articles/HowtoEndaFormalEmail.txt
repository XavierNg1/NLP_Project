 In a formal email, just write a summary of everything that you've written, just to be polite and wrap it all up.;
, Never do things such as "Cheers," "Love," (or any variation of that) "Kisses," "LOL," etc. If you are including this, write something like, "Best," "Warm/Best wishes," "Take care," "Kind regards" , "Sincerely" or similar.
 It is important to have a signature that includes your basic contact information, such as your full name, phone number, fax number, work number, work address, work email, etc. What you do not want to put in a formal email are lyrics in neon colors, lots of smiley faces, or inside jokes; the things that one might put on their signature in a casual email. Just include what is necessary, and be mature.

 Most colleagues will not stop you if you appear to be on a mission or in a hurry to get somewhere. If you are intercepted, try saying; “do you know which conference room the meeting is in?”

, Get out of chatting by saying that you are on your way for a quick bathroom break. Hopefully no one will be so rude as to question you on that!

, Let the chatterbox know that you are heading to the break room for a quick cup of coffee, tea or a snack anytime she catches you off guard in the hallway. If she insists on joining you in the break room, you can chat for as long as it takes to prepare your cup of coffee, and then say “I really must get back to it.”

, Look for a colleague and immediately tell the chatterer that you have to speak with that person about an urgent matter. If no one else is around, you can say “have you seen Jim? I need to meet with him about this project that’s due within the hour”, and then purposefully rush off toward Jim’s office.
 If the office magpie is keeping you from getting any work done, stop stressing out about it and give yourself a break. Tell your coworker that you have to be somewhere important at a certain time. There’s no need to explain that you are simply going for a walk, just hurry out the door, and don’t return to your desk until the coast is clear.

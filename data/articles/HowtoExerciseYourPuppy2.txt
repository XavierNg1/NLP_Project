 Teaching your puppy the basic commands, like sit, stay, and come, is a great mental, as well as physical, exercise. Start by teaching your puppy the sit command.


Sit down next to your puppy. Place a hand on its chest and another hand on top of its rump, i.e., just behind the rear legs near the tail. Say "sit" as you apply gentle pressure to the chest and its rear. Guide your puppy into a sitting position. Once it is in the sitting position, give your puppy a treat. Repeat this at least once a day until your puppy understands the sit command., Before you begin walking your puppy, you will need to introduce your puppy to the leash. Let your puppy sniff and see the collar. Reward your puppy with a treat for allowing the collar to be near it. Then, place the collar around your puppyâ€™s neck. Have the collar around its neck for only a few minutes at at ime. Gradually increase the amount of time your puppy wears the collar.
Make sure to reward your puppy with treats for good behavior.

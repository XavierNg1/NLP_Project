YouTube is not a joke book. It sort of is but not to joke about death, politics, religion, destruction, racism or anything else hateful or damaging.
YouTube is not a pornography site. Please, keep it clean and appropriate! Do not upload images involving body parts or people having sex. YouTube just is not the right website for such. Such videos will be deleted, so do not waste your time.
YouTube is not a pornography advertisement. Please do not advertise pornography or sex via YouTube either. If you post a comment or video advertising pornography or sex, it will most likely be removed.
YouTube is not a plagiarism board. Do not upload videos that do not consist of your help of production. In other words, do not upload the video if you did not make the video yourself or if it came from another company.
YouTube is not for violence. Do not upload videos that violate the safety and/or privacy of other people.
YouTube is not a hate campaign. Do not upload any videos that are damaging, threatening or violent (for example, “I’m gonna blow your brains out.”) Such videos will be deleted.
YouTube is not a “rule free” Web site. Just follow the rules and you will be fine there!;

YouTube is just as safe as Facebook and MySpace; with proper repercussions of course.
YouTube is a place where you can become famous.
YouTube is a place for promotions. You may upload TV Promotions, but YouTube would be unlikely to appreciate uploading the whole TV show.
YouTube is an imaginative broadcasting area. YouTube is for viewers to be impressed by others’ imagination, not copycats.
 You can post it if you would like, but can have it so that everything about you is unknown to those who watch your videos and go to your channel.

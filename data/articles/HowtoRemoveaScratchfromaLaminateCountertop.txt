Use warm water and liquid dish-washing soap or spray undiluted vinegar over the affected area to remove any existing stains before treatment. If the scratches are too deep and the vinegar does not remove the stains, pour small amounts of rubbing alcohol over the affected area instead.

Waxing your laminate countertops is the best solution for hiding and covering smaller, lighter scratches.



Use the soft cloth to spread the wax lightly across the rest of the countertop, including the sections unaffected by scratches. This procedure will keep the appearance of the countertop consistent.



Use another clean, soft cloth to buff the wax or use an electric, motorized buffer tool that contains a lamb's wool applicator for optimal results.



Laminate pastes and fillers will penetrate the deepest parts of scratches and conceal them completely. Seam and laminate fillers and pastes can be purchased specifically for wood or plastic laminate countertops.
Select a paste or filler that matches the color of your countertop from any hardware store or retail store that specializes in home repair. You can also contact the manufacturer of your countertop directly for filler product recommendations or for help with determining the exact color of your countertop.
Apply multiple layers of the laminate paste or filler to each scratch using the method outlined by the instructions on the packaging. You may also use measurements of one-sixteenth of an inch (1.58 mm) for each layer.;

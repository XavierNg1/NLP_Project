 A microfiber cloth is made from materials that will lift and collect the majority of loose dust, dirt, and grime from your car's ceiling.


Use a dry, clean microfiber cloth to gently rub the ceiling of your car in the direction of the grain in the headliner fabric.;
, The upholstery cleaner should be compatible with and safe to use on the ceiling's fabric type. For example, if your car's ceiling is made from vinyl, purchase a vinyl cleaner.


Visit a local retail store that specializes in auto parts and products to locate an upholstery cleaner that is safe to use on the ceiling fabric in your car.
 An upholstery shampoo or cleaner will remove any dust, dirt, and grime that the microfiber cloth was previously unable to remove.
 After the upholstery cleaner has worked itself into the headliner fabric, the microfiber cloth will remove any leftover stains, dirt, dust, and other grime.
 A mixture of 3 parts water and 1 part distilled white vinegar will remove grease stains from the headliner without affecting the glue and laminate that attaches the fabric to the ceiling.


Saturate a clean microfiber cloth with the water and vinegar mixture, then gently rub the cloth against the grease stain for removal.
 If your car's ceiling remains dirty after the first application of upholstery cleaner, the fabric must dry completely to prevent the wet glue from detaching the headliner fabric from the car's ceiling.
 Products such as these can help remove unpleasant smells such as cigarette smoke or food smells from the headliner.


Refrain from saturating the fabric of the car ceiling with air fresheners, as some air fresheners may contain chemicals that can eat away at the glue keeping the headliner fabric attached to the ceiling.

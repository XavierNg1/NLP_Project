 You will need this when the plane is taking off and landing, as electronics will not be allowed. Books are a staple, as well as small crafts (ex. thread bracelets, coloring books)=;
, If the airline you are traveling on gives free snacks, you may not need to. However, candy is sold all around the airport, and packing it means you don't have to pay outrageous airport prices for it. Unlike going to the movie theatre, this isn't even against the rules.


Pick clean snacks. This isn't the time to be finishing off your leftover chicken wings.
 Music is a good distraction, and, especially important for red-eye flights, an excellent way to help your child fall asleep. On nearly all planes you will not have wifi, so be sure there are some games downloaded that don't need the internet.


Be sure to remember headphones, but if you don't have them, most aircraft sell them.
Make sure it isn't noisy enough to disturb other passengers.
 If the ride is long a pillow and blanket will really help, or your child may wish to bring a stuffed animal.


Whatever you bring should be washable. Airplanes are not the cleanest of places, and Mr Stuffins probably shouldn't be going directly from one to being pressed up against your child's face in their bed.
 Airplanes can be cold.
 Because of the size of their ear canals, changes in pressure affect small children even more than adults. Save it for when you are landing, and then give it to them. It will force them to swallow and help the descent be less painful.

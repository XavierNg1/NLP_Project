 To prepare well for a pap smear test, it is important to know how the examination will be performed. A Pap smear test usually takes a few minutes and it can be done in a doctorâ€™s office or at a clinic.
 You may be asked to undress completely or your remove clothes from the waist down. If you are asked to undress completely, you will be given a hospital gown to put on.


If you are only getting a pap smear, and not a breast exam, you will most likely only be asked to get undressed from the waist down.
 You will be asked to lie down on a couch or exam table with your knees bent. Your heels will rest in stirrups at the end of the exam table.


These stirrups ensure that your legs are far enough apart that the doctor can perform the test comfortably.
 The doctor will gently insert an instrument called a speculum into your vagina; this instrument can be metal or plastic. This instrument helps to hold the vaginal walls apart so that the doctor can access the cervix. The doctor will warm the speculum so that it is at the same temperature as your body to make the exam more comfortable. The doctor will also lubricate the speculum to reduce the discomfort that you are likely to feel when it is being inserted into your vagina.The doctor will then use a scraping device that looks like a long, soft brush to take a sample of the cervical cells. The examination is not painful but you might feel a bit of discomfort when the speculum is being inserted. The patient is likely to feel some pressure on the tube pelvic region.
 The samples are then taken to the laboratory; the results can take up to 14 days to be processed. Most doctors or clinics will contact the patient when the results are in so that they can be discussed.

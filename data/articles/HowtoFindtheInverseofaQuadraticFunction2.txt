 In order to begin finding the inverse, you must begin with the equation in the format f(x)=ax2+bx+c{\displaystyle f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c}. If necessary, you may need to combine similar terms to get the equation into this format. With the equation written this way, you can begin to tell some information about it.The first thing to notice is the value of the coefficient a. If a>0, then the equation defines a parabola whose ends point upward. If a<0, the equation defines a parabola whose ends point downward. Notice that a≠0. If it did, then this would be a linear function and not quadratic.
 Before you can find the inverse function, you will need to rewrite your equation into the standard format. The standard format for any quadratic function is f(x)=a(x−h)2+k{\displaystyle f(x)=a(x-h)^{2}+k}. The numerical terms a, h and k will be developed as you transform the equation through a process known as completing the square.Notice that this standard format consists of a perfect square term, (x−h)2{\displaystyle (x-h)^{2}}, which is then adjusted by the other two elements a and k. To get to this perfect square form, you will need to create certain conditions in your quadratic equation.
 Remember that a quadratic function that is a perfect square originates with two binomials of (x+b)(x+b){\displaystyle (x+b)(x+b)}, or (x+b)2{\displaystyle (x+b)^{2}}. When you perform this multiplication, you get a result of x2+2bx+b2{\displaystyle x^{2}+2bx+b^{2}}. Thus, the first term of the quadratic is the first term of the binomial, squared, and the last term of the quadratic is the square of the second term of the binomial. The middle term is comprised of 2 times the product of the two terms, in this case 2∗x∗b{\displaystyle 2*x*b}.To complete the square, you will be working in reverse. You will start with x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} and some second x-term. From the coefficient of that term, which you can define as “2b,” you will need to find b2{\displaystyle b^{2}}. This will require a combination of dividing by two and then squaring that result.
 Recall the original form of the quadratic function ax2+bx+c{\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c}. If the first coefficient is anything other than 1, then you must divide all terms by that value, to set a=1.For example, consider the quadratic function f(x)=2x2+6x−4{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+6x-4}. You must simplify this by dividing all terms by 2, to yield the resulting function  f(x)=2(x2+3x−2){\displaystyle f(x)=2(x^{2}+3x-2)}. The coefficient 2 will remain outside of the parentheses and will be part of your final solution.

If all terms are not multiples of a, you will wind up with fractional coefficients. For example, the function f(x)=3x2−2x+6{\displaystyle f(x)=3x^{2}-2x+6} will simplify to f(x)=3(x2−2x3+2){\displaystyle f(x)=3(x^{2}-{\frac {2x}{3}}+2)}. Work carefully with the fractions as necessary.
 You already have the first two terms of the perfect square quadratic. These are the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} term and whatever coefficient appears in front of the x-term. By taking that coefficient to be whatever value it is, you will add or subtract whatever number is necessary to create a perfect square quadratic. Recall from above that the required third term of the quadratic is this second coefficient, divided by two, and then squared.For example, if the first two terms of your quadratic function are x2+3x{\displaystyle x^{2}+3x}, you will find the needed third term by dividing 3 by 2, which gives the result 3/2, and then squaring that, to get 9/4. The quadratic x2+3x+9/2{\displaystyle x^{2}+3x+9/2} is a perfect square.

As another example, suppose your first two terms are x2−4x{\displaystyle x^{2}-4x}. Half of the middle term is -2, and then you square that to get 4. The resulting perfect square quadratic is x2−4x+4{\displaystyle x^{2}-4x+4}.
 This is a tricky concept but it works. By both adding and subtracting the same number in different locations of your function, you are really making no change to the value of the function. However, doing this will allow you to get your function into the proper format.Suppose you have the function f(x)=x2−4x+9{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}-4x+9}. As noted above, you will use the first two terms to work on completing the square. Using the middle term of -4x, you will generate a third term of +4. Add and subtract 4 to the equation, in the form f(x)=(x2−4x+4)+9−4{\displaystyle f(x)=(x^{2}-4x+4)+9-4}. The parentheses are placed just to define the perfect square quadratic that you are creating. Notice the +4 inside the parentheses and the -4 on the outside. Simplify the numbers to give the result of f(x)=(x2−4x+4)+5{\displaystyle f(x)=(x^{2}-4x+4)+5}.
 The polynomial inside the parentheses should be a perfect square quadratic, which you can rewrite in the form (x+b)2{\displaystyle (x+b)^{2}}. In the example from the prior step, f(x)=(x2−4x+4)+5{\displaystyle f(x)=(x^{2}-4x+4)+5}, the quadratic factors into (x−2)2{\displaystyle (x-2)^{2}}. Carry along the rest of the equation, so your solution will be f(x)=(x−2)2+5{\displaystyle f(x)=(x-2)^{2}+5}. This is the same function as your original quadratic, f(x)=x2−4x+9{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}-4x+9}, simply revised into standard f(x)=a(x−h)2+k{\displaystyle f(x)=a(x-h)^{2}+k} form.Notice that for this function, a=1, h=2, and k=5. The value of writing the equation in this form is that a, being positive, tells you that the parabola points upward. The values of (h,k) tell you the apex point at the bottom of the parabola, if you wanted to graph it.
 The domain is the set of x-values that can be used as input into the function. The range is the set of y-values that can be the outcome. Recall that a parabola is not a function with a definable inverse, because there is not a one-to-one mapping of x-values to y-values, as a result of the symmetry of the parabola. To resolve this problem, you need to define the domain as all values of x that are greater than x=h, the apex point of the parabola.Continue working with the sample function f(x)=(x−2)2+5{\displaystyle f(x)=(x-2)^{2}+5}. Because this is in standard format, you can identify the apex point as x=2, y=5. Thus, to avoid the symmetry, you will only work with the right-side of the graph, and set the domain as all values x≥2. Inserting the value x=2 into the function gives the result of y=5. You can see that the values of y will increase as x increases. Therefore the range of this equation is y≥5. 


, This is the step where you begin to find the inverted form of the equation. Leave the equation in its entirety, except for switching these variables.Continue to work with the function f(x)=(x−2)2+5{\displaystyle f(x)=(x-2)^{2}+5}. Insert x in place of f(x), and insert y (or f(x), if you prefer) in place of x. This will yield the new function x=(y−2)2+5{\displaystyle x=(y-2)^{2}+5}.
 Using a combination of algebraic steps, and taking care to perform the same operation evenly on both sides of the equation, you will need to isolate the y variable. For the working equation x=(y−2)2+5{\displaystyle x=(y-2)^{2}+5}, this revision will look like the following:x=(y−2)2+5{\displaystyle x=(y-2)^{2}+5}   (original starting point)


x−5=(y−2)2{\displaystyle x-5=(y-2)^{2}}    (subract 5 from both sides)

±x−5=y−2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x-5}}=y-2}     (square root of both sides; remember that the square root results in both positive and negative possible answers)

±x−5+2=y{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x-5}}+2=y}     (add 2 to both sides)


, As you did at the beginning, examine the inverted equation to define its domain and range. With two possible solutions, you will select the one that has a domain and range that are inverses of the original domain and range.Examine the sample equation solution of ±x−5+2=y{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x-5}}+2=y}. Because the square root function is not defined for any negative values, the term x−5{\displaystyle {x-5}} must always be positive. Therefore, allowable values of x (the domain) must be x≥5. Using that as the domain, the resulting values of y (the range) are either all values y≥2, if you take the positive solution of the square root, or y≤2 if you select the negative solution of the square root. Recall that you originally defined the domain as x≥2, in order to be able to find the inverse function. Therefore, the correct solution for the inverse function is the positive option.

Compare the domain and range of the inverse to the domain and range of the original. Recall that for the original function the domain was defined as all values of x≥2, and the range was defined as all values y≥5. For the inverse function, now, these values switch, and the domain is all values x≥5, and the range is all values of y≥2.
 To make sure that your work is correct and your inverse is the right equation, select any value for x and place it into the original equation to find y. Then, put that value of y in the place of x in your inverse equation, and see if you generate the number that you started with. If so, your inverse function is correct.As a sample, select the value x=3 to place in the original equation f(x)=x2−4x+9{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}-4x+9}. This gives the result y=6.

Next, place that value of 6 into the inverse function x−5+2=y{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x-5}}+2=y}. This does give the result of y=3, which is the number you started with. You can conclude that your inverse function is correct.

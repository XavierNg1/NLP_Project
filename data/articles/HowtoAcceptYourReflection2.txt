 Every time you start to think negatively about yourself, stop yourself. You may have to tell yourself “no, don’t think that.” Respond with a compliment instead. Even if you don’t believe it at first, over time, you will start to build confidence.Say something positive out loud about your appearance, such as:“You look fantastic today.”
“You are awesome. Don’t give up.”
“You’re in control. You can conquer anything you put your mind to.”
”Look at that smile. You’re beautiful.”

, Take a stack of post-it notes. On each one, write a positive note to yourself. You can also include an inspirational quote. Leave these on your bathroom mirror and any other mirror you may use frequently. Read the note every time you look into the mirror. You may even want to repeat it back to yourself.Some notes may include:


"You can do anything you put your mind to."
"You decide your destiny."
"No one can define who you are except you."

, If you’re in a bad or depressed mood, you might start to think more negatively about your reflection in the mirror.Before you look in the mirror, start repeating positive things about yourself. You can say:


"You got this. This will be a good day!"
"Let's get this done. There's nothing you can't handle."

, Do not say or think anything to yourself that you would not say to your best friend. When you are feeling down, comfort yourself in the same way. As you look in the mirror, talk to your reflection as though it were another person. Use the same kindness and compassion on yourself that you would other people.

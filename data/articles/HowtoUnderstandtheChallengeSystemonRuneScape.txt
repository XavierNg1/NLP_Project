Challenges in general are a list amongst the 25 different skills in the game. You can browse through the drop down menu on the left. By clicking on the different materials or activities within that skill, you can learn how much you would need to accomplish for that specific challenge.






Daily challenges are at least 5 random regular challenges. Certain activities, for example quests, it will allow you a few days to complete the task.
 He will then take the items you have made/done, if it's in your inventory or bank. You can only receive rewards when fully completing daily challenges. Rewards can include a helpful amount of experience in the specific skill, as well as a chance to receive a mystery bag. Mystery bags are surprise items that calculate up to the amount of materials you have may used for the challenge. For example, if you buried 10 dragon bones, you may receive a few pieces of runite ore.
 This is the best method to save money and get experience as well. Prepare your bank by mining your own ore for a future smelting/smithing challenge. Cut your own logs for any fletching or firemaking challenges. Kill Chaos Druids for herbs and save them. You will save thousands or millions of coins by doing this when you hit an expensive skill, such as herblore, fletching, crafting, or construction.

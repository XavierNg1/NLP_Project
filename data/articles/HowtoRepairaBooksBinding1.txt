 Most craft or hobby stores carry book or binding glue. It usually comes in a tall, thin tube. Make sure you purchase an acid-free glue: if you use a glue with acid in it, it can cause the pages of your book to disintegrate or eat away at the spine of the book., Set them aside so you don’t get any glue on them. Make sure you set them aside in the right order. You don’t want to accidentally glue them back into your book out of order!, Open the book and squeeze some glue onto the inside of the book’s spine, where the pages have pulled away. Using a popsicle stick, spread the glue so that it covers the spine evenly., Make sure you have them in the right order first! Then carefully line up the top and bottom of each set of pages so they’re even with the pages still attached to the spine of the book. Firmly press the edge of the set of pages to the spine so that the edge evenly attached to the spine.You might need to wiggle the pages a bit to get them to line up exactly with the rest of the book. That’s okay, but work quickly so the pages don’t end up sticking where they’re not supposed to!

, This helps keep all the pages evenly in place while the glue dries. You can also stack other, heavier books on top of the book you’ve repaired., After the 24 hours are up, carefully remove the rubber band (or other books) and gently flip through the pages of the book. They should all feel secure. If they don’t, you may need to repeat the gluing process.

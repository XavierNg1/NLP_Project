 Say to yourself, "I don't have time to think about this right now. I'll write it down and I can think about it later." There will be a time and a place to worry about yourself and your loved ones later. You don’t need to worry about forgetting because each thought is recorded on your list.;
, Choose a set time and place for worrying about the bad things that could happen. Give yourself permission to worry freely during this time each day. This is your worry period. What you think about is entirely up to you. You don’t need to edit or limit yourself. Whether your thoughts are productive or unproductive doesn’t really matter.If an anxious thought about yourself or your family comes up during the day, try to set it aside. Tell yourself that you will be able to think it through later, during your worry time.This will get easier with practice.
It should be roughly the same time each day (e.g. from 4:30 to 5:00 p.m.).
It should also be early enough that it won’t make you anxious right before bedtime.
It is important that when your worry period is up, you actually stop worrying. Get up and go do something else to help take your mind off the fears you were just mulling over.
 When you find yourself beginning to worry about what could happen, look at your to-do list. If you don’t have a list, begin one. List your goals and the steps to meet them.Begin with simple tasks, like cooking dinner or doing the laundry.
Try to focus on one task at a time.

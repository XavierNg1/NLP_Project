 If your wedding has a theme, match your cake to that. This is a cake that you will want your guests to photograph for their Instagram accounts, so choose a memorable and quirky design to match you and your partner's personalities. If your cake will be on display throughout your celebration meal, make sure your color choices don't clash.For instance, a fall-themed cake could have autumn colors, a winter wedding could have a white/silver/blue cake, and a tropical destination wedding could have a vibrantly-colored cake.;
, There are many different styles you can pick for your wedding, and they can range greatly in terms of formality and atmosphere. The cake colors you’d have for a rustic mountain wedding would most likely be different than the cake colors you’d choose for an elegant evening wedding.

If the dress code for your wedding is black tie and the theme is a more traditional and sophisticated wedding, then choose simple and elegant colors, such as black and white.
If you are having a more relaxed, boho wedding, or a nature-inspired wedding, you can choose colors found in nature, such as green or yellow.
If your wedding style is bold and adventurous, then go for a purple ombre frosted cake, or consider red velvet cake with white frosting.
 If an amateur baker has offered to make your wedding cake or if you can't set aside much of your wedding budget on cake, you might want to go with a more simple cake design. Simplicity can be quite elegant, so don't stress about spending all of your wedding money on the cake.

Colors of frosting may stain the cake itself, and it might be difficult to slice if you pick a lot of decorations, so take each detail into consideration.

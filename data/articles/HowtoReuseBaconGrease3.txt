 Without gas or kerosene, starting a campfire can be very challenging. However, if you soak a few paper towels in bacon grease, place them on the wood and light--you’ll have a fire.


If you don’t want to soak paper towels, you can soak pinecones ahead of time, place in a large sealable plastic bag and bring camping.
 Combine 4 cups bacon grease with 2 cups of cool water, 4.2 ounces of lye and food coloring. Heat in a large pot and pour into a mold. Allow several hours for it to cool.
, Pour cooled grease into a small glass cup or bowl with a wick in it..


Tie a cotton string to the middle of a stick or toothpick (depending upon the width of the cup or bowl). You want most of the string to hang into the bacon grease with a small amount sticking up on top.






Lay the toothpick or stick across the top of the jar or cup.






Light the top of the string and allow it to burn. After 15 to 30 minutes the bacon grease becomes a solid.

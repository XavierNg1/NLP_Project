 Open the freezer door and take all the food out. Remove the freezer shelf.;
, You may have to remove one of the freezer shelf supports on the side to get the panel out.
 When I tried to remove it, the head started to strip. I used an electric drill and a large twist bit to drill the head off that one. Hopefully, you won't have to do this. If you do, be very careful not to drill through the back plate, or you might drill a hole in the evaporator. Then you will have trouble you probably can't fix.
 Mine had 4 small hex screws holding it in place. Once this is done you can see the evaporator fan. Mine had two screws holding it in place and three wires hooked to the fan. Make a note of the position of the wires.
 Don't pull on the wires themselves, only on the connectors.
, The fan blade is not attached. Get the new plastic fan and remove the bronze-colored metal clip on the fan's hub. Carefully press the fan onto the fan motor shaft. About 1/8" of shaft should protrude from the front of the hub. Use the needle nosed pliers to spread the metal clip apart, and slip it on the hub. Push the metal clip down into place with the flat screwdriver. The front of the clip should be approximately flush with the front of the hub.
 The mounting holes in the new fan are much larger than the holes in the original fan. If your freezer has a plastic interior, you may not need these parts.
 In my case this meant rotating the ground wire lug (green wire) to make the wire fit better. There was almost no slack in my wires.
 Don't screw it down yet. Next connect the wires in the same way they were connected before, Now screw the fan down tight, but be careful not to strip out the plastic screw mounts.
 If the fan blades are hitting something, you will have to reposition a part. Once it sounds good, turn the power back on for a minute and make sure the fan operates quietly. Don't touch anything inside the refrigerator at this point.
 Put the shelf back in and you're done!

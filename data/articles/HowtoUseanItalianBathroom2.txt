 Stand extra close for easier aim. If failing, don't worry. Flushing will rinse it.
 If you hear a strange noise and water is rinsing the entire toilet area floor, don't worry. It's how it "flushes".
 If you have an accident with aiming, clean it off with some toilet paper you should bring from home. Wash and dry hands and leave.

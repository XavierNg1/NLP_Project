 Instead of having young flower girls, consider using older women in your family, such as your grandma or great aunt. They'll love to be included in a special way, and the sight of your grandma throwing flower petals into the air is to sure to bring a smile to everyone's face., One of your adult friends may find the idea of being a flower girl enchanting. It may not be a good idea to assign a friend the role, as it's normally reserved for a young girl. However, if someone you know expresses interest in being the flower girl, consider letting that person do it.The exception to not asking a friend to do it is if you're having an adults-only wedding. In that case, it may be appropriate to ask a friend to be your flower girl (or woman, as the case may be). Alternatively, you could name the person a bridesmaid, but still have them throw flowers.
 While pre-teens and teenagers are usually made junior bridesmaids, they can also be flower girls if that's your preference. However, it's important to talk to them and make sure they won't feel slighted by the role. Emphasize how important the role is to you to help them feel valued.
 If you want to include your dog in the ceremony, you could dress it up in a garland of flowers. Then another flower girl could lead it down the aisle, or you could have someone stand at the altar and call the dog to them., If you don't have a girl to be in your wedding, try using a younger boy as an "announcer." He can carry a sign or wear a small chalkboard that announces the bride is coming down the aisle. Alternatively, you could have the boy throw petals.

 There are many, MANY books about feelings for preschool-aged children. Some of the ones I've used are The Way I Feel by Janan Cain, Today I Feel Silly by Jamie Lee Curtis, and my personal favorite Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day by Judith Viorst. Most kids love storytime, and it's a great opportunity to incorporate the theme.;
, Whether it's in the classroom, at a community center, or at home, dramatic play is an important part of understanding emotions and how to express them. Play theater games with them, such as Feelings Charades or Mirror (face each other and choose who the mirror is; the mirror copies the other person). Even just acting out a favorite story, such as the Three Little Pigs, can teach children about appropriate emotions (e.g. if they're the Wolf: "Is he happy right now? Is he mad?")

, Flashcards allow for a variety of activity. You can start with basic recognition exercises, and then change it up by playing a matching, memory, charades, or any other game you think up.
 Depending on the skill level of each child, this may be a self-portrait of how they feel or simply a representation. Allow this activity to be completely child-directed; joy can be expressed with swirls, frustration with dots, anger with scribbles. If they feel open to it, talk with them about why they drew their feelings that way.
 It's important that the children are involved in this process, or they may not understand the objective. Read about and discuss various emotions that they might feel each day. If you're a teacher, have your "Star of the Day" (or something similar) indicate how they feel that day and why. Try to have varying degrees of "Happy", "Sad", and "Mad", such as "Silly", "Tired", and "Frustrated" so that children are encouraged to pick a new emotion.

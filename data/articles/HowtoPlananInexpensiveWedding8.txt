 There are many beautiful compositions of recorded wedding music available that can be played at the ceremony. Download some songs or play a CD at key moments during the ceremony.


Ask a friend or family member who is not in the wedding party to be in charge of the music for this part.
 Save money by hiring a local band that wants exposure and practice, rather than a more professional band that will cost more money. Meet with the band to go over your preferred types of music and listen to them play.
 If youâ€™d like to play music during the reception, or have dancing at the reception, make a playlist of the music yourself. Make a list of must-have songs that you and your partner want to hear. Ask a friend or family member to keep tabs on the music to make sure it plays smoothly throughout the reception.


Back up the playlist by burning them onto a CD or putting them on a backup drive.

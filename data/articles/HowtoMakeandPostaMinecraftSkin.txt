 There is no download required to make the skin.;
, You can make a new skin if you want to.
 Because people will think that you're copying if you do premade parts!

, Click on the square with the red color and choose the color of the skin. When you choose it, get the bucket icon and click on the area of the Steve face. Then add the hair, eyes, mouth. Then on the sides, add the hair (only if the skin is bald, add the skin color).
 Add the skin color like you did with the face. Then make the t-shirt part. Don't forget to do all the sides of the skin!

, Add the skin color like you did with the arms and the head. Then add the t-shirt.
 Add the skin color as usual. Then add the pants and the shoes. After that you're finally done with the skin! (Only if you want to add additional hair on the hat)

,, Then wait for the ad to finish and when you have the option to save it, only save it! Don't put it to Minecraft.net.
 Search planetminecraft.com and create an account.
,,, Then Browse the skin and click save.

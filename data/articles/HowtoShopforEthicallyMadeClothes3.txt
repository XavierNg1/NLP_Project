 Buy items from local artists who sew beautiful dresses or knit soft sweaters. If you don’t know a local clothing artist, consider buying homemade items on websites like Etsy. By purchasing homemade clothing, you are ensuring that your clothing is made ethically as well as supporting a local artist., If you have the time and interest you could learn to sew your own clothing. When you make your own clothing you don’t have to worry about how your clothing was made. Take a sewing class or watch online video tutorials to teach yourself how to sew., Learning to sew can also save you money by allowing you the ability to repair the clothing that you already have. You will easily be able to reinforce busted seams, replace broken zippers, and add missing buttons to articles of clothing that you would typically throw away.

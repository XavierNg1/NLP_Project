 Sometimes an Epsom salt bath is needed or desired, but there just isn’t enough time. An Epsom salt paste is the answer to that problem because it can be used in the shower. Add a quarter of a cup (59 mL) of olive oil to Epsom salt. Use just enough Epsom salt to create a spreadable paste., You can apply the paste to your hand, loofah, or cloth. Apply the paste to one problem area, or your whole body. Scrub for a few minutes in total.You can also let the paste sit on one part of your body while you shampoo your hair or shave your legs.
 Once you have scrubbed, rinse off the paste. Make sure there isn’t any gritty paste left on your body before stepping out of the shower.

, Arceus is an Event Pokémon, meaning that it could only be acquired legitimately through special events held by Nintendo. The last Arceus event was in 2010 and there are no more planned, meaning the only way to get one in Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum without cheating is to trade with someone who got one from the event.

Arceus is an incredibly rare Pokémon, so you'll likely only be able to trade for one if you have an equally rare Pokémon to offer in return. Event Legendaries such as Landorus and Deoxys are good choices. If you have a Shiny Legendary such as a Shiny Mew or Shiny Rayquaza, this will also be good for trading.
 This can be done by trading Pokémon to yourself or by download 3DS software like pokebank, which allows you to to perform transfers with a single system. The steps for transferring Pokémon will vary depending on which versions you are transferring to/from.

Since Arceus is not available in earlier versions, you will at least be transferring from Generation 4.
You can trade an Arceus from Diamond, Platinum, Pearl, HeartGold, or SoulSilver using PokeTransfer, as well as from any of the Black or White games as a regular trade.
In order to get an Arceus from an older version of the Pokémon to X or Y, it will need to first be transferred to Black, White, Black 2, or White 2. You can then use PokeTransporter and PokeBank to transfer Arceus into X or Y.

 Attempting 24 multiple choice questions in 45 minutes is easy, so instead of wasting time worrying, read the questions carefully. This will help you to score better. You may even pass with flying colours.
 Depending on how you prepared and your study of the Life in the UK Test handbook, you should know the answers to at least 50% of the questions. So instead of losing time struggling with difficult questions, keep answering the easier ones first. You can always go back to the questions you've left unanswered later. Spending too much time on a question you're not sure of will just increase your stress and decrease your confidence and concentration. However, this doesn't mean you should answer the easy questions in a hurry. The 45-minute time limit is enough if used wisely to attempt all questions and even to do some double-checking at the end., After answering all the easy questions, you may still be worried about the ones you still haven't answered. Relax for a moment and take a deep breath. Then start tackling the remaining questions. Remember, you've already completed a major portion of the test., Read the difficult questions over again, slowly and carefully. Since these are multiple choice questions, you can probably find the right answer just by paying attention to the wording.

If after reading the question again, you still feel can't answer it, move on. Spending too much time on one question means you may end up not having enough time to complete other questions you might know the answers to. If you still have time at the end, return to those tough questions.
 If you guess, you at least have a chance of getting the answer correct. If you're lucky and do guess correctly, you'll improve your score. Not answering at all will not help your score.

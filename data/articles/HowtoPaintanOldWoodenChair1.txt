 Use a cloth dipped in soap and water to remove any cobwebs, debris or dirt build-up on your wood chair. If there is a grease build-up, use a grease remover followed with a water rinse. Allow the chair to air dry completely.;
, If your chair is covered with chipping paint, use a coarse grit sandpaper to remove the larger pieces, then use graduating levels of finer grits until you reach the desired finish. Sand out light scratches and dings, as they will show when you paint your chair.
 If the blemishes are too deep to be removed with sanding alone, apply wood putty to the marks and allow it to dry per the manufacturer's instructions. Once dry, sand the excess putty away until your surface is smooth.
 Use a tack cloth or slightly damp cotton cloth to remove the dust from sanding. Allow the chair to air dry before proceeding.

 The primary computer is the computer it was synced up to originally. This is the computer that stores all its original files and data. Grab a USB cord and plug each end into the appropriate device.;
, If you need to download the latest version, do so. Sync it to your computer if you have any updates. Make sure your iPod is recognized and shows up on your screen. It'll pop up automatically.
 If you do not have a recent backup, well, shame on you. There's no way around it â€“ your recent files will be lost. Start backing up your music!


Generally, iTunes prompts you to back up your devices. You may have a back up ready that you don't know about. Don't fret until you go to try it -- a list of your available back ups will pop up.
 This is will restore your iPod to the point it was at at the most recent backup; therefore, only your most recent files will be lost. Better than nothing, right?

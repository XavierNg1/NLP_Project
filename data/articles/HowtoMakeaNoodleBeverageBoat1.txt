 The best kind of container is one created from sturdy, clear plastic with an even, not too heavy weight.;
, Even if you just purchased the container, make sure itâ€™s totally clean before you add your ice and drinks. Use hot, soapy water, rinse well and then dry with a clean towel.
 Keep in mind that you will most likely be filling this container with ice too.

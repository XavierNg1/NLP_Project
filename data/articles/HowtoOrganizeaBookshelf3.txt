 The bookcase will look more striking if the backdrop is darker than the surrounding walls and shelves. Consider painting the back of the bookshelves to create this vivid effect.For open-backed bookshelves, hang a cloth between them and the wall.
 Know what you'll be working with before you start filling the shelves. Vases, fancy tableware, figurines, trinkets, candlesticks â€” your house is your oyster. Gather more things than you think you'll need, so you can test more options.


Vertical, straight-lined objects look similar to the books. This creates an austere, rigid appearance. A few bowls, baskets, or other round objects lead to a friendlier atmosphere.
 Set aside the largest decorative objects, and oversize books if you have them. Space these out along the bookcase, leaving plenty of space between them to create separate focal points. A zig-zag pattern works well, placing these on the left end of the first shelf, then the right end of the second, then the left end of the third., Catch the eye for longer by varying the position of your books. Stack books on top of each other on some shelves, and vertically next to each other on others.


Try a pyramid of books, topped with a small trinket., As you place your books, add a decorative object wherever it looks needed. Use colorful objects in contrast with drab book covers, or vice versa. A pair of tall candlesticks frames a row of short books nicely.
 Bookends come in handy and a variety of decorative shapes. Alternatively, you can use any heavy object to keep your books in place.
 Gaps often look better than a shelf clogged with paperbacks and origami. This is especially important for open-backed bookcases placed in the middle of a room, which need a large amount of space to let light through.

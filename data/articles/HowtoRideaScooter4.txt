The right hand will usually control the front brake and the left hand will control the rear brake., When turning on a motor scooter, you must tilt the handle bar towards the side you wish to turn and actually lean your body in that direction. Your scooter should naturally lean in the direction that you are pressing the handlebar and it is important to get used to this.Practice turning slowly at first.

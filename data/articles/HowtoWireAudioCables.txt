 Use only enough cable to connect the 2 devices. Avoid leaving excess cable rolled up and in danger of picking up outside noise. This also will help to reduce the impedance that the cabling presents between the sending and receiving devices. A good rule of thumb is to keep cable lengths 4 or 5 meters (13.2 or 16,5 feet.) Some professional equipment is specially designed to operate with cable lengths of 10 or 20 meters (33 or 66 feet.) Consult your equipment manuals for more information.;
, Cables come with many types of shielding. The most effective cable shielding types are foil or woven metal. Avoid using conductive plastic or wrapped wire screens.
 Particularly in foil screen cables, this can crack or separate the shield and reduce the efficiency of the screen.
 If both the sending and receiving devices are balanced, make sure that the screen is connected to ground at both ends.


Compensate for an unbalanced sending device. If the sending device is unbalanced, leave the cable screen disconnected at the receiving device. Connect the minus signal of the cable to the pin of the receiving device that would have otherwise accepted the cable screen.
Allow for an unbalanced receiving device. If the receiving device is unbalanced, connect the minus signal to the screen at the sending device. Consult your equipment manual to see if the sending device is fully floating. If the sending device is fully floating, do not connect the minus wire at the sending device.
 Do not run audio cable so that it lays alongside power cables. If the audio and power cables must cross, make the cross at right angles to minimize noise pick up in the cable.

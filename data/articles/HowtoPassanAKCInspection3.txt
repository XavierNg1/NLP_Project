 AKC inspectors will check to ensure that the facility and all enclosures are clean, free from debris, and that feces are picked up in a timely manner. A lack of cleanliness can also signal neglect which may result in suspension from the American Kennel Club., In order to demonstrate that you are complying with the AKCâ€™s policy on caring for dogs, all enclosures will need to be an appropriate size for the dog. This means that the dog is able to sit, stand, lie down, and turn around comfortably within their enclosure. Solid floors are preferred; however, the AKC will allow a perforated floor as long as there is a protective coating. An area with solid flooring must be provided somewhere within the enclosure., The inspector will also check that you have a disaster plan prepared in case of an emergency. Although most people have thought or talked about what they would do in an emergency, it is very important to have the disaster plan written down and posted so that all staff can access the plan. The disaster preparedness plan should reflect the facility and type of dog breed(s) owned.For example, create a portable kit that includes food, bowls, water, leashes, first aid equipment, emergency escape routes, and blankets in case of an evacuation.

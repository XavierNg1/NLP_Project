 If you like, you can substitute other fruity flavors of ice cream, like, for instance, strawberry, for part or all of your vanilla. More vanilla gives a creamier taste, while more of other types of ice cream can give sweeter, fruitier blends.
 Add 2 cups of strawberries and 2 cups of blueberries to your shake for a delicious blend of flavors. Change the proportions of your berries as you wish.
 Milk helps ensure your milkshake isn't too thick or solid to drink. A little bit of milk goes a long way, but don't be afraid to add more if the final product is too thick for you.
 A dash of lemon juice isn't essential for a great-tasting shake, but it can give your shake just a hint of tartness. Don't add too much, as the sour flavor of the lemon can begin to clash with the creaminess of your shake if you're too generous.
 The more ice you add to your shake, the "slushier" it will be. Keep in mind that when ice melts, it makes your shake watery, so drink particularly slushy shakes quickly!

, Serve with a dollop of whipped cream on top of your shake and a slice of strawberry or two on the rim of the glass for garnish. Savor your sweet, delicious beverage!

 For the proper grip, your dominant hand should rest high on the backstrap of the gun. Your other hand should cover the bottom portion of the gun in the space that your dominant hand is not covering and your thumb on your strong hand should be right over your non-dominant thumb. Both thumbs should be pointing towards your target. Rest your trigger finger on the side of the trigger guard until you are ready to shoot.Do not hold the top of the gun or the slide lock as it can cause serious injuries to your hands.
Holding your gun with the correct grip will help you minimize the effects of recoil., Stand with your dominant foot behind your non-dominant foot, a hip length apart from one another. Bend your torso forward slightly, and balance on the balls of your feet to counteract the kickback that's generated from the pistol.Do not bend backward. Your shoulders should be in front of your hips.
 The pad of your index finger should be in the direct center of the trigger of the gun. When firing, steadily press your finger in a rearward motion. There should be a level of slack on the trigger before you reach resistance. Once your shot is fired, allow the trigger to move forward again and reset before taking your next shot.The pressure should come from your trigger finger only. Do not pull the trigger by tightening the grip on your hand., The front and back of your sights should align on the top, and vertically. When aligned correctly, there should be equal distance between the front sight and either side of the rear sights. Proper sight alignment is necessary for your shots to be accurate.If your close range shots are accurate but at long range veer to one side, there's a good chance you'll need to readjust your sight alignment.

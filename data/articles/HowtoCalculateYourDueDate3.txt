 Estimating your due date on your own or using a website can give you a rough idea as to when you might deliver, but a doctor can confirm how far along you are. At your first prenatal appointment, your doctor may order a vaginal ultrasound to more accurately determine your due date.


Ultrasounds are more accurate in determining due dates when done early in the pregnancy. Later ultrasounds help in seeing if the fetus is growing well, but it doesn't help in determining fetal age.
 A due date is not set in stone, nor should it be: your baby will pop out whenever she is ready to, and hopefully not a day sooner or later. As such, a due date is always a work in progress. Some pregnant women even have their due dates changed mid-term.

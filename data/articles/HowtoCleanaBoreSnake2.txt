 Put your snake inside a wash bag, pillowcase or something similar. Tie it shut. Alternatively, roll the snake up and then tie it up with white shoelaces or a similarly light-colored machine-safe cord. Do not use the snakeâ€™s pull cord to do this, since the knots may tighten during washing, which means you might have to cut the cord to undo your bundle., First, set your washer to a small load on the delicate cycle. Start filling it with water and add a few drops of mild laundry detergent. Once the machine fills, switch it off., Once the machine has filled, place the snake in the soapy water. If it isn't too dirty, give it 15 to 20 minutes to soak. Give it 30 to 40 minutes if it's very soiled., Switch the machine back on once the snake has had a chance to soak. Let the cycle run to its end., Once the cycle completes, take the snake out of its bag or remove its ties. Pin the snake to a clothesline or hang it over a clothes hanger or drying rack so it can air-dry.

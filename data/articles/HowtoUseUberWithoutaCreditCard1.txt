 You can use your PayPal account to sign up for and ride with Uber as long as it is available in your country. PayPal allows you to use your bank account to pay for your Uber rides, so there’s no need for a credit card.
 To use PayPal as a payment method with Uber, you must have a valid PayPal account with a linked payment method. See How to Use PayPal to Transfer Money for help signing up with PayPal and linking your bank account.

Linking your bank account will take a few days because your bank account will need to be verified.
 Now you’ll register for Uber (if you haven’t yet).

If you are already an Uber member, just launch the app, tap “Payments” in the menu, and select “PayPal” as your method of payment.
 Type your name, e-mail address, phone number, and a password to protect your account., A text message containing a confirmation code will be sent to the mobile phone number you provided., The app wil automatically attempt to connect with your PayPal account.,, Use the slider at the bottom of the map to select a type of Uber vehicle. For a description of each Uber vehicle type, see How to Pick the Correct Uber Type., Here you will find the ETA (estimated time of arrival), maximum party size, and minimum fare., On the details screen, tap “Get Fare Estimate.” Here, enter the address of your destination and tap it in the search results.

Once you have viewed the fare, tap your phone’s back button to return to the map.
 Enter your destination address the same way you entered your current location., In a few moments, you will see the driver’s name, license plate number, and a short description of the vehicle. Head to the pickup location you specified and wait for your driver.

The app will keep you up to date on how far away your driver is from your pickup location.
When the ride is complete, the total amount will be deducted from your primary payment method in PayPal.

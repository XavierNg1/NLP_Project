 When using syrup, the expectation is that it will cover the base half but it will also seep into the cake, so it must be a flavor that matches well with the cake and the cake texture must be such that it will take well to being soaked, such as a sponge cake or a cake with a slightly dry texture that could do with having moisture added.


Syrups to use might include: chocolate syrup, strawberry syrup, maple syrup, golden syrup, buttery syrup, etc.
 Cover as much of the base half as possible but don't go right to the edge in case the syrup spills over the side and looks unsightly.


It is also okay to poke a hole in the top half of the cake and to drizzle some syrup into the top half via the hole (or holes). This would be done where you want both halves of the cake to be well infused with the flavor or where you're trying to rescue an overly dry cake.
 Frost or ice the rest of the cake if you're doing so.

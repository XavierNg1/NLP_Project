 Breaking, chipping, and dulling are more likely to happen when your knife is stored freely.


If you store your knives in a drawer, invest in a set of knife blade covers to minimize contact with other utensils., This is the most common storage choice. Many knife sets will come with a block, but you can also purchase an empty knife block to store your knives in. This option is safe, allows you to keep all of your knives in one place, and also can help knives keep their edge longer.


If you get your knife block separately from your knife set, you may discover that many of your knives don’t fit in the pre-sized slots., Mount a magnetic knife rack on a wall in your kitchen and store your knives vertically. This method keeps your knives easily accessible while being safely off the counter. Most importantly, magnetic knife racks keep your knife blades stable.


Magnetic knife racks aren’t a possible storage option if your knives are ceramic.

 Use it when you refer to a finished time, such as last night, yesterday, etc. stunk is the participle form (okay, never mind that word), but it means you use it with have, has, or had. These sentences are correct:


She sure stank up the kitchen last night with that burned milk!
I'm sorry, but the baby's diaper really stank on the way home yesterday!
The house hasn't stunk this badly since the day we found that rat behind the dryer.
If you hadn't stunk up the bathroom, I wouldn't have opened the window and let your orchids freeze in the snow.;
, That means it doesn't have an -ed at the end (like live - lived - lived). It's like this verb: drink - drank - drunk.
 That's not your problem. (It's a noun here.)

, That's also not your problem. (It's an adjective here.)

, That's wrong. It should be stank.
 That's wrong. It should be stunk.

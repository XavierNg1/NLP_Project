 A poorly-planned bento shows.
 Expect to spend 3-4 hours in the kitchen cooking rice, making decorations, and assembling bento.
 The most common decorations are seaweed designs on onigiri, and other flat foods (such as cheese) cut into flowers. Cookie cutters and scissors are invaluable to this task. For seasonings and sauces, use small bottles and containers (specifically for bento)

, It should cost at least ten dollars, depending on the materials used.

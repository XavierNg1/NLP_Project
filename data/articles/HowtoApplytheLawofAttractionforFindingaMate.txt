 When you think of finding the perfect mate for you, there will be the hint of an image in your mind of what they might look like. Focus on it, add details to it until that 'ideal mate' is clear in your minds' eye.;
, When picturing them in your mind, there's a feeling that goes with it. FEEL that feeling. Intensely.
 FEEL intense emotions of love and joy and excitement with your declaration, while holding the image of them firmly in your mind.
 You've just sent your intention out to the Universe. There's no need to keep peeking out the window to see whether the delivery van is coming yet, and certainly no need to question or doubt whether your dream mate will be 'delivered'. You've placed your order, now let it go and let the Universe do it's part of the job.
 FEEL genuine gratitude for them, no matter how big or small they might be. For instance, "thank you for the house I'm living in!". "Thank you for my friends!", "Thank you for my job!", "Thank you for this breakfast/beautiful day", etc. Being thankful and grateful puts our mind in a higher state of frequency that will help keep our minds focused on the day our dream walks into our life.
 From now until your mate manifests, the only thing you're going to focus on is the image of your mate and at the same time, FEELING exactly the way you will feel the day they come into your life. Hold that feeling of excitement and joy and bliss! Keep it with you right through every single day until he or she arrives. The more you do that, the faster your mate will manifest.
 Every morning, rather than making your declaration all over again (because you only need to do it once), repeat steps 5 and 6 before you get out of bed, after you get out of bed, while you have a shower, while you drive to work, etc.

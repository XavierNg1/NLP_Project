 It is vital that you find someone you can trust and include him in on your plan. Take the divide and conquer approach because two heads (or more) are better than one.For example, if you’ve been the butt of numerous sexist jokes, confide in a trusted same sex colleague to see if he has experienced something similar.


Start the conversation off without admitting anything. You need to determine if your colleague also feels the same way about your boss as you do. If they admit uneasy feelings about your boss, proceed in including him into your scheme.
 Don’t spend all your time invested in your clandestine operation. It is important that you still do the job you’re suppose to do. Make it your mission to be the best employee you can be so no one can point the blame on you. You may even have a boss that decides to try to dig up some dirt on you.


Don’t lose sight that you are being paid to work and must fulfill this commitment you made.
 Even in a slam-dunk situation where the boss has been blatantly violating numerous codes or violations, your manager may not go away overnight, or even at all. The boss may know what you’ve been up to, or may suspect it, so she may have already tried to cover her evidence.


In the worst situation, your boss may cook up a story that would prove you wrong.
In the event that it looks like your manager may not get fired, consider if you can stand to continue work at the company., While being on top of your current position will help secure your job, you might be happier working somewhere else. Search the internet for job listings calling for your position. Even if you choose not to apply, having the options could ease the tensions at work. It never hurts to look and you might find a better opportunity.

 You'll need six or seven large popsicle sticks for the best look, but you can also use smaller sticks. Cover them with washi tape or other patterned tape, or decorate them with markers, colored pencils, or paint.
 Lay two sticks down vertically, about five inches apart, and glue a decorated stick horizontally across the top. Glue the next decorated stick adjacent to the first, being careful not to let any glue show through the crack. Continue until the two vertical sticks are completely hidden by the decorated sticks.
 Glue wooden shapes, beads, paper, buttons, ribbon, or anything else you like to the front of the frame.
 Smaller pictures work better for this frame -- using a wallet-sized photo leaves room for more decoration, making both the picture and the frame look good. Use glue, tape, or a push pin to attach your pictures to the frame.
 Glue a strong magnet to the back of the frame, centered horizontally and near the top, so that you can hang the picture on your fridge or anywhere else magnetic.









You can use a hook instead of a magnet if you prefer, but the small size and light weight of this frame makes it a perfect addition to your fridge or school locker.

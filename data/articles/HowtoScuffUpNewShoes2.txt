 Not only will this prevent any damage to the laces, it also gives you better access to the shoe’s other surfaces. Specifically, you’ll get better access to the tongue if you’re wanting to scuff it., Start by focusing on the heel and toe. These two areas are usually the most scuffed when a shoe is allowed to wear naturally. Stick to fine grit sandpaper, and pass it over the heel and toe. Once you’re satisfied with these areas, sand the rest of the shoe more lightly.


If you see blue fuzz come off the shoe, you’ll know the sandpaper is working.
Denim and canvas aren’t particularly hard to sand. If you feel like you’re not making progress, change to a new sheet of sandpaper., The stiff bristles on these brushes, often made of metal, will tear into the fabric deeper than a piece of sandpaper. For these deeper scuffs, you’ll want to focus on the heel and toe of the shoe. This is to imitate the natural wear and tear found on old shoes. Be careful not to pass over the same spot too many times; you might tear a hole into the shoe., Whether it’s the sole or the toe, black marks make for very obvious scuffs. Rub some shoe polish onto a rag, and push streaks onto the rubber of the shoe. Be careful not to overdo it, or it will definitely look like you faked the scuffs. Don’t make the scuffs too large or too dark., Use light pressure, only enough to create a visible line on the shoe. Too much pressure and you’ll slice right through the shoe, making it less comfortable to wear and even affecting the shoe’s structural integrity if the cut is large enough.


You can also drag the knife along the surface of the shoe to scuff it without cutting. This will mimic damage from regular scraping.

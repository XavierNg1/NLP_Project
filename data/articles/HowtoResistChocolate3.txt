 If you have any get-togethers with friends or family that include desserts, offer to bring something that isn’t chocolate-based to share. When you’re going out to eat, check the menu ahead of time. Planning out what you’ll eat can keep you from giving in at the last minute.
 Chocolate is a standard go-to for desserts, but that doesn’t mean you have to do without dessert. Instead, think of dessert options that are healthier, or at least ones that don’t have chocolate in them. You might choose to opt for a cheese plate, or if you need something sweet, go for a fruit sorbet.
 Carob doesn’t have quite the same crave-appeal as chocolate, but it does still have a creamy taste and the look of chocolate. It’s made from carob tree pods, and can be used as a natural sweetener. Many health food stores and even aisles in the grocery stores have carob snacks and treats., Dark chocolate can be good for you, in small doses. There is evidence that it can help you avoid strokes and might even improve your skin. You will want to limit the amount you eat, but if you need to give in, a small piece of dark chocolate is a good option., Having healthy food easily accessible will make it easier to fill up on it. You can choose items that are easy to eat without preparation, such as baby carrots, grapes, or apples, or you can buy more prep-intensive items, like pineapple. For the more prep-intensive fruits and veggies, prepare them as soon as you get them home so that you won’t have to do anything but grab a bowl from the refrigerator.
 You might find it impossible to remove all chocolate from your life, but that’s okay. Moderation is key. Special occasions are a chance to give in a bit. Just limit your intake – if you get chocolates for a holiday, like Valentine’s Day, find other people that aren’t avoiding chocolate. Keep a few pieces for yourself, but give the rest to them. They’ll probably thank you, and you can feel good about passing it along instead of giving in to your urge.

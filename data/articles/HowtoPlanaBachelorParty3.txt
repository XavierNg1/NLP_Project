You are the best man and responsible for the groom to have a memorable night. It is up to you to be responsible for keeping everyone together, finding rides, closing tabs and making sure everyone has a good time.



If you have a quiet group, or people that donâ€™t really know each other, make sure you go out of your way to get the conversation started, get people meeting each other and make sure that everyone is getting along.

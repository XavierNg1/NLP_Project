 The chuck is piece on the end of the drill that loosens and tightens to hold the bit. Grasp the chuck with one hand while you hold the handle of the drill with your other hand. Twist the chuck counterclockwise to loosen it. Another option is to pull the trigger gently while holding the chuck.








Loosening the chuck will open the jaws that clamp onto the drill bit.;
, Once you loosen the chuck, the drill bit that you currently have in the drill will start to wobble. You should be able to easily pull it out of the drill once the jaws that clamp it to the drill are loose.








Always inspect the bit when you remove. If it looks damaged or worn, throw it out so you don't accidentally use it again later.
 Hold the bit with your thumb and index finger so that the smooth part of the bit (the shank) is facing the jaws of the chuck. Insert the bit into the chuck and immediately pull it back towards you about a centimeter.








Keep your fingers on the bit and the chuck since the bit isn't secured and could fall out.
 Tighten the bit into place by giving the trigger a few short squeezes. Your other hand should still be loosely holding the bit in place while you do this.








Lightly holding the bit while squeezing will ensure that the bit is installed straight.
 If your drill has a ratcheting mechanism to apply extra pressure to the shank of a drill bit, you'll need to click it into place. To engage it, firmly twist the ratcheting mechanism next to the chuck in a clockwise motion.

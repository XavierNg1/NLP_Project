 If you miss the bus or are running late, it can be tempting to chase after the bus. However, this is a terrible idea. The bus driver probably will not see you and you will be putting yourself in danger.Once the bus starts moving, you need to be still.


You may accidentally run into traffic and get hit by another car on the street.
The bus driver probably won't turn the bus around to pick you up anyway.
 If you stand too close to the bus, your bus driver may not be able to see you. If you need to cross in front of the bus, take 5 giant steps before you cross. If you are on the side of the bus, stand 3 giant steps away.


Never walk behind your school bus.
Take 3 giant steps back from the curb when your bus approaches.Make eye contact with your bus driver before you cross in front of the bus. This will guarantee that the bus driver sees you., Although cars are supposed to stop when you board the bus, some drivers may forget. Always look for moving cars before you get on and off the bus. This is especially important if you have to cross the road to get on the bus.If you are crossing the street, wait until the bus driver signals that it is safe for you to go.
Stand on the sidewalk instead of the street when you are waiting for the bus. If there is not a sidewalk, stand as far away from the street as you can.

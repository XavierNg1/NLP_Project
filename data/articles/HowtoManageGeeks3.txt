 Geeks have an ingrained sense of fairness, probably related to the fact that in IT, structure and consistency is critical. The documentation can’t say one thing while the code does something else, and similarly, managers can’t say one thing and then do something else.
 Geeks usually know the technical side of the business better than the manager, so making a technical decision without consulting can be one of the most costly mistakes a leader can make.
 Geeks need to feel valued, and few ever understand what they do in order to appreciate them. If you have a problem you need a geek to solve, instead of ordering "fix this broken report", try "We can't work out why this report doesn't seem to match this other one––can you help?". If possible, allow the geek involvement in the diagnosis, and they will get to the core of the problem––you may find a novel solution that highlights other business weaknesses!

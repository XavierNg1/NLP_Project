 Be sure to add a note in your summary that you have taken or traded the bug or coin, so people know who took it and when.
 Find the specific one that you have and click on the link. This will bring you to the official page of the bug or coin., Look at the different options and select the correct one for you:

Retrieve from _____: You have found the geocache in the same cache that the previous person dropped it in.
Grab it from somewhere else: You've found the bug/coin in a different cache than listed.
Write note: Notes can very much assist people whom are looking for it, especially the owner. This helps on the condition and whereabouts of it.
Discovered it: If you come across it in a cache, but you don't take it, you can "log" it on its page, noting that it's there. It's a controversy on whether or not to use this, as some people only log if they decide to take it and others log its "existence" for the purpose.
 Inform people about your discovery or plans on travelling it to a different cache., Whether you find a new cache on the way or want to revisit one that you've already logged, make sure that it fits properly in it., If you've already visited it, make a note. If it's your first time there, make a "Found It" log. You don't need to specify the actual name of the coin or bug - as you can simple say, "Dropped TB" or "Took ___, Left coin".

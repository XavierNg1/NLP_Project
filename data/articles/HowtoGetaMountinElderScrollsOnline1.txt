 As an Elder Scrolls Online player, there are plenty of ways to earn crowns. Crowns are used as a microtransaction currency, but they are also rewarded as loyalty gifts for reaching certain loyalty goals. There are a few ways to earn crowns:


Purchase the game - You will be given a 500 crown reward right off the bat.
Have an active subscription - You will be given 1500 crowns for every 30 days of active subscription purchased.
Be a returning player - If you played the game before the subscription was removed, you’ll be rewarded another 500 crowns.
Purchase crown packs - You can purchase crown packs from the Xbox Game Store, the PlayStation store and from the Elder Scrolls Online website for PC/Mac users. The larger the crown pack, the cheaper it will cost per crown. The cheapest mount costs 900 crowns, so by that logic, a new player could purchase the 750 crown pack and use the 500 crown reward for purchasing the game.

750 crowns ― $7.99 USD / $9.99 CAD / 6,99€ EUR / £4.79 GBP
1,500 crowns ― $14.99 USD / $17.99 CAD / €12,99 / £8.99
3,000 crowns ― $24.99 USD / $29.99 CAD / €20,99 / £14.99
5,500 crowns ― $39.99 USD / $49.99 CAD / €34,99 / £23.99

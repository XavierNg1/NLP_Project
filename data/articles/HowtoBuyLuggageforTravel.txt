 If you are traveling by car, you can take more than what you need. If you are taking an airplane or other public forms of transportation, you may be forced to travel lighter to deal with limited space and to avoid any extra baggage fees.;
, Identify your “must haves” in a piece of luggage. For instance, if you need something lightweight and easy to handle for a weekend getaway, duffel bags make more sense than large, heavier rolling cases that are better suited for longer trips.
 While it is nice to have options, packing one outfit a day instead of a variety of clothes will save you time when dressing and also help you in narrowing your items down to fit in one case. Keep this helpful hint in mind: many hotels offer laundry services, so you can save space by packing fewer clothing items and telephoning the front desk for laundry services.
 The size of the luggage should match the length of the trip. Choose a smaller case if you are only going to be gone for only a few days and similarly a larger case if your trip will be lengthy.
 Don't over think the packing process. Make a list of items you really need- visualize your daily routine and make a list of all the things you need. This will help you in making sure you pack all of your required items and that they are organized and not just thrown together.

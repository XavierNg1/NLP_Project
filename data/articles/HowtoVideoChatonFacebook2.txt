 If your computer doesn't have a webcam connected, you'll need to install one before you can video chat.
 Click the Chat menu in the lower-right corner to open the Chat menu if it isn't open already.


You'll need to use Chrome, Firefox, or Opera. Video calling is not supported in Internet Explorer, Safari, or Edge. , You can select people you commonly chat within the list, or you can search through all of your friends by typing the name into the field at the bottom of the list.


Facebook currently only supports chats with a single person at a time. Group video chats may be added in the future.
 The button looks like a silhouette of a video camera. A new window will appear for the video chat.


If you are not able to click the video chat button, the recipient is not able to receive video calls.
 The process for this will vary depending on the browser you are using. Generally, you'll need to click "Allow" or "Share" to allow Facebook to access your webcam.
 The recipient will be notified either through the Facebook website or in their Messenger app, depending on their online status. If they choose to answer, your video chat will begin.

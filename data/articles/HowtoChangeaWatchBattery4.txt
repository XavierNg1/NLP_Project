 You'll need to get a ball of a sticky thumb tack or glue that will adhere to the back of the watch and help you rotate it. You can purchase this at most arts and crafts stores or online.There are also grip-balls that are made specifically to open the back of a screw off watch.
 Knead the tack until it's soft and sticky. Press it hard against the back of the watch., Once the tack is attached to the back, twisting it counterclockwise should loosen the back of the watch until it's not attached.

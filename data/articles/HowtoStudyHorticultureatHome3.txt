 Look through your local newspaper or community bulletin board for gardening groups or clubs. They may hold meetings or seminars where you’ll learn valuable garden knowledge. Clubs also usually tend a community garden where you can get hands on experience with various plants.

If you can’t find an official club, ask around your friends and family to see if anyone works a garden that you could come and check out.
 Search the business directory for plant farms near you. Give them a call and ask if you could spend a few hours a week working with them. Just watching how they tend the plants will teach you a lot. Work the plants if they will let you., If you are interested in starting a new job path, or you have some free time to pick up part-time work, look for nursery jobs. Your job would consist of growing plants and transplanting them to their new homes.

This type of work requires you to be outside and do a lot of bending and heavy lifting. Make sure you are physically fit enough for this type of work.
 One of the best ways to learn is by doing. So find a garden spot in your yard, till up the soil, and plant some seeds. You may not succeed with all of the plants at first, but you’ll learn a lot along the way. Find a few food plants or flowers that you are interested in, and buy seeds to start up your garden.

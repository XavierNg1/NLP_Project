 Randomly displaying affection is a surprising way to show her you care. Whether it’s a flirtatious pinch, a kiss, a shoulder rub, or a late night phone call, she’ll appreciate that you’re always thinking about her.Make it a point to pull out her chair somewhere unexpected and goofy, like a fast food restaurant.
Ask her if she needs help with anything heavy, or any other way to show your strength.
Buy her a small chocolate or treat when she’s having a bad day.
A card with words of encouragement would be a perfect “thinking of you”-move on a day she has a big test.
 Be a sexual person and flirt whenever you can.To flirt appropriately you’ll need to be witty. Women enjoy a clever back-and-forth. Flirting is partially teasing and partially showing you’re attracted. Try a few approaches similar to the ones below:


Make it clear that you’re being purposefully goofy, "If you had to choose between me and Brad Pitt, how quickly would you choose me?"

Break the touch barrier. A gentle squeeze of the arm, a swipe of the hair, do something subtle and surprising.
 If hugging makes you feel uncomfortable, try a side hug. If you feel more brazen, try a firm hug with a squeeze, or maybe a peck on the cheek. Watch for signals, like winking, biting of the lip, or if she stares at your lips. Pull her in close and slowly kiss her, but be sure you’ve got fresh breath and aren’t too aggressive.Make eye contact as you’re going in for the kiss.
Don’t make it too long. Make it long enough to be memorable, but not exceedingly long.
Make sure you only kiss her. Don’t use it as an opportunity to touch or grab unnecessarily.

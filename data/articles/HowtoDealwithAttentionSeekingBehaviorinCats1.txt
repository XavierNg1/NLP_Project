 A cat can start displaying attention seeking behaviors at any age. Attention seeking can indicate loneliness, boredom, or can be accidentally encouraged when pet owners respond to undesirable behavior. Specific behaviors might include:Excessive meowing
Constantly walking around or circling your legs
Jumping
Stealing things or knocking objects off tables
Biting, clawing, or other aggressive acts;
, Excessive meowing, aggression, and other attention seeking behaviors might indicate an underlying medical condition. Your cat might be signaling pain or discomfort from an issue like dental disease, arthritis, or central nervous system conditions. Schedule a vet visit if you’re concerned about your cat’s sudden unusual behavior., Attention seeking behavior can also develop or become more noticeable in older cats. Lots of meowing or crying, aggression, and constantly demanding to be petted can indicate cognitive disfunction or age-related anxiety in senior cats.Discuss your senior cat’s behavior with its vet. Have them rule out or treat an underlying physical condition.
Ask the vet about treating age-related behavior issues with anti-anxiety medication, cat pheromones, and by making your home more comfortable for your senior cat.
 If you can rule out underlying causes, keep track of when and how your cat exhibits unwanted behavior. Look for patterns that might indicate if the behavior is due to loneliness, boredom, or accidental reinforcement.For example, if your cat whines and meows excessively at night, it might mean your cat is lonely. Keep in mind some breeds, like Siamese, tend to be more vocal than others.
Aggression, chewing, and eating non-food items can indicate boredom.
It’s easy to accidentally reinforce behaviors like persistent rubbing and demanding to be pet. If you consistently respond to these behaviors, your cat might end up constantly craving human contact.

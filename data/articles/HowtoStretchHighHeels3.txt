 If you live in a reasonably populated area, then there's a good chance that you have access to a shoemaker or a shoe repair shop. Search online for a reputable cobbler in your city, and then pay him/her a visit., A simple stretching job should be relatively cheap â€“ likely in the range of $15-30, depending on the cobbler, the region, and the degree of stretching that you need done. However, this route is almost certainly more time-consuming and more expensive than stretching your heels at home. Remember that in most cases, you are paying for quality and convenience.

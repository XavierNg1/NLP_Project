 Break apart a few corks and arrange the pieces inside a paper cup. The cup should only be about half full.The cork can be broken, crushed, or cut, but smaller pieces are more ideal than whole corks.
Cork is a very dry and absorbent material, which allows them to act as very effective firelighters.
If you do not want to use a paper cup, you could also use something like an ice cube tray. Just make sure that the mold is fairly small and durable enough to withstand the heat of the melted wax.
 Cut a small strip of rope and place it in the cup, wedging it in between pieces of cork. The rope should be upright.


If you don't have rope, you could make a wick by rolling a strip of flammable fabric, cardboard, or paper into a thin tube.
 Slowly pour enough melted wax into the cup to completely cover the cork. Make sure that the wick is partially submerged and partially exposed.


Candle wax works notably well.
Work carefully when handling melted wax. Liquified wax is very hot and can easily cause burns if brought into contact with the skin.
 Set the cup aside and allow the wax to completely cool. Once the wax has hardened, you should be able to peel off the paper cup.


Store the firelighters in resealable plastic bags until ready to use.

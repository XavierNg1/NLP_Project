 Purchase a nicely colored and intact brick.;
, If you do, paint the animal's name onto one of the long sides of the brick. Use outdoor paint, so that it endures.
, Another alternative is to glue a small vase to the brick, so that fresh flowers can be placed in the vase regularly. Remember to add water as well.

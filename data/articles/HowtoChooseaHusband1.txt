 First dates are often awkward and it can be difficult to properly judge someone after just spending a few hours together.Of course, if you aren't attracted to him or he does something egregious, you are under no obligation to see him again. Likewise, even if marriage is very important to you, don't think about how every guy you date can be "the one." This kind of thinking puts too much pressure on budding relationships and may make you rush into a marriage you aren't ready for., This doesn't mean you should tell a man you've just met all of your most personal secrets. However, do your best to be yourself during the casual dating phase, rather than the person you think he would want you to be. If he doesn't like the real you now, you two will probably not be a good match when things get more serious.
 Most cultures around the world have traditionally used some form of matchmaking to help people find their ideal mates. Even in countries where matchmaking had fallen out of fashion, the practice has seen a recent boost in popularity.If you've ever joined a dating website with an extensive personality quiz, you've engaged in a modern form of matchmaking.

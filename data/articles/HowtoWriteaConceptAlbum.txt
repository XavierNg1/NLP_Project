, What is important to you? Do you have a message you want to project to change society? Or have you got a vision of the future (or the past or present for that matter) that you want to turn into a story? Or do you just have a story to tell, plain and simple?

 "Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of the War of the Worlds" is an excellent example of doing this.

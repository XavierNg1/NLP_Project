 The plants prefer full sun, but in hot climates, hibiscus will grow in light shade.
 Plant the hibiscus in soil that does not hold water when it rains. If the area retains any water, you may choose to amend the ground with at least 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 cm) of organic material, such as sand, peat moss or manure, prior to planting. This will allow for improved drainage.
, It is not necessary to remove flowers. Trim only areas of the hibiscus that have become leggy.

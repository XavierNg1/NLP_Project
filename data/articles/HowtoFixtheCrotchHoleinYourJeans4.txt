 Another easy alternative to sewing in a patch is to get an iron-on patch and use that instead. As always, begin by cutting away excess threads so the hole is clear, before turning your jeans inside out and preparing the patch you are going to iron on to your jeans. Measure the hole with a tape measure and cut the patch to size ensuring that there is a clearance of at least ½ inch around the hole.You can measure this by eye, but by using a tape measure, you are less likely to get it wrong and end up wasting a patch by cutting it too small.
Cutting rounded corners on the patch will help prevent it peeling up.
 Whether you are adding the patch to the outside or the inside of the jeans, using a scrap of denim on the opposite side to the patch will prevent the patch sticking to the other side of the jeans and potentially sticking the two sides together. This could seal your jeans shut and you might damage them if you then have to tear the leg open again., With a pre-heated iron you should now place the patch over the hole and iron it down. How long you should do this for could depend on the particular iron-on patches you have, so be sure to read the instructions carefully and follow those. Typically it won’t be for more than 30-60 seconds.


Once it is set, remove the scrap piece from the opposite side and you are good to go.

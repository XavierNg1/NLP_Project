 Having no appetite while technically hungry is usually a temporary thing. Regardless of the reasons why you might be feeling this way, there should come a time where your appetite finally catches up with the rest of your body. If you don't need to eat right this instant, you're better off holding off on it until you're at such a point where you can enjoy your meal in earnest.;
, It's quite possible that your body is in fact too tired to send proper signals of hunger to your brain. If you're feeling drowsy at all, it' a good idea to get a quick nap to help replenish your energy. Even a power nap as short as half an hour should do well to get your appetite going again. , Nothing whets the appetite like a walk or a decent jog. Going for some moderate exercise will help stimulate your body and remind you what you need the energy from food for.


Granted, if you have no appetite, it may feel be that you're not feeling good in other areas. Exercise is recommended in a lot of cases, but if you're feeling sick, it may be best just to have a nap instead.
 Arguably the best possible thing you can do to stimulate your hunger is to drink water. This will fill your stomach for a short time and hopefully stimulate you for more to come.
 If you've done what you can and still feel dubious towards eating something, the best possible advice is to start small, and eat slow. Even if it's just serving a fraction of your meal to yourself at a time, the manageable portions will prove far less daunting than a full meal.


Make sure you're as relaxed as possible; if you're feeling tense and really don't want to eat, your gag reflex might work up as you're trying to eat.

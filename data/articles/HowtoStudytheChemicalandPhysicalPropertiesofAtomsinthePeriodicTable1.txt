 On the periodic table, the majority of atoms are classified as metals. Other atoms are classified as nonmetals. You will find these groupings beneficial as you explore the properties of different atoms.Nonmetals can be found primarily in the upper right corner of the periodic table, while the rest of the table consists primarily of metals. Hydrogen is an exception to this rule, as it acts like a nonmetal under standard conditions, but it is found in the upper right corner of the table.
Carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, and noble gases (the elements in the far right column) are commonly known nonmetals.
Halogens (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, etc.) fall into the nonmetal category.;
, Metals are grouped into subcategories. Elements within these subcategories are alike in more specific ways than just identifying both as metals. The common categories are alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals, post-transition metals, lanthanides, and actinides.Alkali metals are very reactive and readily ionize to a 1+ state.
Alkaline earth metals are slightly less reactive, but readily ionize to a 2+ state.
Transition and post transition metals are more stable and have many different ionization states.
Lanthanides and actinides are larger, less stable molecules that readily react. Some of them decompose, making them radioactive.
 Such elements do exist, and they are known as metalloids. On the periodic table, metalloids show up between post-transition metals and nonmetals. There are eight metalloids:Boron
Silicon
Germanium
Arsenic
Antimony
Tellurium
Polonium
Astatine

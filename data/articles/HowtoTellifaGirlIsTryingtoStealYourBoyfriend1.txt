 Just because she flirts with your boyfriend does not mean she’s trying to steal him. She might flirt with him to build up her own self-esteem or because she wants to be friends with him. Does she flirt with everyone, or just with your boyfriend specifically? If she generally comes off as flirty, it’s doubtful that your boyfriend is a special case. If she makes special effort to flirt with your boyfriend, she might have a crush on him.

Here are some flirty behaviors to watch for:

She puts her hand on his arm or touches him frequently.
She makes eye contact with him.She laughs at all of his jokes.
She moves her body so that she faces him.She initiates conversation with him.;
, If the girl wants to be alone with your boyfriend, it demonstrates that her flirting is not just for social power and self-esteem. Make note of when they spend time alone together.

Look out for the following things:

She invites him for outings where it will be just the two of them, such as the movies or lunch at a coffee shop.
She asks him to do her favors (such as change a lightbulb) where he would go somewhere alone with her.
She asks him to go on walks with her.
When he says he’s going to do something, such as get a glass of water in the next room, she invites herself and goes with him.
 Is your boyfriend secretive about his texts with her? Does she call or text him more than you would with a platonic friend? Although this communication does not mean that she wants to be more than friends, it can be a red flag.If you see your boyfriend texting someone frequently, ask him who it is. If he is dodgy or defensive about it, it might be her.
Going through your boyfriend’s texts might be an invasion of privacy. If he seems as though he is lying, have a conversation with him about trust.

 This is the easiest and most primitive method, requiring the fewest and most common supplies. You'll need:


a small box
a small tea candle that fits inside the box
a small metal tray that can rest on top of the box, possibly the lid from a candle or the top to a tin of hand cream
a glass big enough to cover the metal tray
a small rubber tube or bendy straw

, Light it. Make sure it's spaced in the middle of the box to avoid catching anything on fire.


Basically, you're going to heat what you're planning on smoking on the tray with the candle and use the glass to collect the vapor, which you'll inhale through the tube. It's a simple method.
 It helps to have the flame low enough so that it won't scorch the tin too badly. Put whatever you plan on smoking on top of the tin lid.
 Find a good-sized glass big enough to fit over your tin and small enough to rest on the edges of your box. Wait for the glass to fill with vapor.
 When you see the glass begin to fill with vapor, you can start inhaling through the rubber tube. When you're finished, you can take this apart easily and no one will know the difference.

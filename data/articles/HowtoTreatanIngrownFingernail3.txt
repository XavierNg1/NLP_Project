 If your ingrown fingernail has become infected, or it has not gotten better after around five days, you may need to see your doctor. Your physician may treat the ingrown fingernail with a topical antibiotic that you spread on the skin.If the infection is deep in the finger, your physician may prescribe an oral antibiotic.
If the ingrown fingernail is caused by a fungus (this is often the case if you have chronic ingrown fingernails), your doctor can determine this and offer treatment options to you.
Let your physician know if the pain around an ingrown fingernail is getting worse, if the redness and tenderness spreads, if you cannot bend the finger at any of the joints, or if you have a fever. These symptoms point to a more severe problem.
 For an ingrown fingernail that is infected but has not started producing pus, your physician may want to lift it. Lifting the nail helps separate the nail from the skin so it can grow over the skin instead of into it.When the nail is lifted, your physician will place something between the nail and skin to keep it separate. Usually, your physician will put cotton, dental floss, or a splint under your nail.
If your nail is badly infected or ingrown, or you feel uncomfortable lifting the nail yourself, you can get your doctor to lift it.
 If you have recurrent ingrown fingernails, your physician may recommend some form of surgical removal. Most commonly, a doctor will perform a partial nail avulsion. This is where the part of the nail that is ingrown is cut out.If you have a partial nail avulsion, you will have to watch as the nail grows back. You will have to ensure that the nail does not grow back into the skin.
In severe cases, the entire nail bed may be removed using chemicals or a laser treatment. This, however, is rarely necessary for fingernails and is more commonly used to treat ingrown toenails.

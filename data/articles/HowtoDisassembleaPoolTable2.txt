 Remove the rail bolts with a socket wrench and detach them from the table. If two lengths of rail are connected at a corner, you may need to flip them over before you detach them gently. Carefully flip the table over and unbolt the legs. Do not attempt to disassemble the rest of the table without professional help, since removing the coin-operated mechanism can make reassembly difficult or impossible.Some Valley Dynamo coin-operated tables have a metal trim covering the rail bolts. Remove the screws holding the trim in place, slide the trim toward the corner, then lift them up and out., Most tables with a ball return system are also coin-operated, but some tables from the 1970's or '80's have a simpler mechanism.In some models, removing the mechanism without damaging the table is difficult.Unless you have a manual for your model, leave the ball return mechanism attached during transport.


You can usually disassemble the rest of the table as described in the standard slate table instructions.
 If your pool table surface is made from fiberboard (MDF), wood, or any other non-slate material, it is most likely a low-cost "disposable" table. These are not usually meant to be disassembled, not even by a professional.Transport the table in one piece.


Some of these tables have folding legs to make transport easier.

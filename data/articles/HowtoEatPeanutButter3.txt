 Is there a better vehicle for peanut butter than a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? From professional cyclists to lazy bachelors, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches might be one of the great equalizers of western civilization. It's just about perfect. Within that perfection, though, there's a great amount of variety and options, making it both simple and limitless.


The Classic starts with two slices of white sandwich bread. Spread a thin layer of peanut butter on each slice, then a thin layer of grape jelly on one side of the peanut butter. Lay the other slice of bread, peanut butter side down, onto the jelly side, keeping the jelly from soaking into the bread. Cut in half and enjoy with milk.
 Start with two slices of toasted whole-grain seeded bread. Spread a thin layer of chunky, all-natural peanut butter on both slices. Line one side with thinly-sliced banana, and a drizzle of honey, or Nutella if you really want to gild the lily. Served warm with a cup of coffee, you've never had a better meal.
 Start with your favorite plain sandwich bread, the whiter the better. Spread smooth peanut butter on one side and marshmallow fluff on the other. Popular throughout New England, this is the unofficial state sandwich of Massachusetts. Serve this with a cup of spicy hot chocolate. Step aside, lobster roll.
 Ready to get weird? Spread chunky peanut butter on your favorite sandwich bread, then spread red chili sauce like Sriracha on one side, to taste. Crunch BBQ potato chips, or another chip you like better, on top of that. Serve with a PBR. Don't tell your mom.
 The king of rock 'n rolls favorite sandwich was as epic as he was. Start with a whole Italian sub roll and scoop the inside out. Spread a thick layer of peanut butter on the inside, and a generous helping of grape jelly and sliced banana. Then top with crispy fried bacon. Close the roll and fry the sandwich in the bacon grease and serve with grape soda. It's insane.

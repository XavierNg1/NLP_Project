 Your Sims will continue Trying For a Baby as teens.
 If you hear the chime, wait four days for your Sim to have her baby. If not, turn your Sims back into young adults, have them try for a baby again, pause the game just before they start, and turn them back into teens. Repeat until you hear the chime.

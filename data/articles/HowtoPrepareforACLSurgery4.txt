 It should be noted that in some instances, the healing process after a surgery is slowed and can even fail. Therefore, you need to eat the right amount and types of food before the surgery to give yourself the best chance at a healthy recovery.
 Amino-acids are the building block of protein and without protein, the body cannot heal itself. Getting a sufficient amount of protein in your diet will allow your muscles to rebuild properly and swiftly.


With this in mind, eat lean meat, legumes, and fish such as tuna, salmon, sardines, and trout.
 Though kiwis may seem tiny, they are densely packed with nutrients that can help you recover from surgery. Kiwis have an amazing amount of Vitamin C (twice as much as found in oranges). They also contains large amounts of fiber, potassium, phytonutrients, minerals, vitamins and more.


Vitamins, minerals, and potassium are known to help in collagen formation, essential for the healing of the graft.
Aim to eat at least two kiwifruits a day.
Kiwi has higher antioxidant content when it is very ripe.
 Cherries are high in anti-inflammatory substances which will decrease the swelling of your current knee injury. In addition, after the surgery, the anti-inflammatory properties of the cherries will decrease pain and swelling you experience.
 Guavas are rich in antioxidants, lycopene, and vitamin C. These substances aid in healing by supporting collagen formation, decreasing free radicals in the body, and suppressing inflammation.
 Your body will not function well without proper hydration. Water keeps your cells healthy and therefore contributes to proper healing.


This means drinking at least 8 glasses of water.

 Federal law requires the college to provide you with a list of required textbooks once you register for classes, so you should be able to find out which books you need well in advance from either the registrar or your professors. You should not need to rely on the campus bookstore to tell you.;
, You might be able to find the occasional good deal at your campus bookstore, but in the vast majority of cases, you can find the books you need for a much lower cost somewhere online.Check out websites like BIG WORDS.com and Campus books.com, both of which direct you toward textbook sellers offering the lowest prices.
Also check out websites that allow users to sell their own used and new copies of a book, like Amazon or Half.com.
 For many textbooks, you can buy an old edition at a lower price without facing too much difficulty.


You might want to check with your professors before doing this, however, in the rare instance that there is a significant change in the new edition that you will need access to in order to survive the class.
 Renting your textbooks will not guarantee a lower price tag, but oftentimes, the price to rent a book will be cheaper than the price to buy. Look into both options and determine which will work best for any particular book.


You can check your campus bookstore for renting opportunities, but there are also online sources, including Chegg, BookRenter.com, CampusBookRental.com, and ValoreBooks.
 If you really want to pinch pennies, you can check for coupons that allow you to save money on textbooks bought online. These coupons will rarely be specific to the publisher, but you might be able to find coupons for various online stores.
 If you know a friend who needs to buy some of the same textbooks, consider splitting the cost in half with that friend and sharing the book.
 Upperclassmen who are done with a textbook for good will occasionally sell it, and the cost is usually pretty cheap since they tend to be more interested in making whatever they can on the book.
 As long as the international edition is printed in the same language, this can be a viable option. Research carefully, however, since international editions can go either way in terms of cost.


Check the cost of shipping, as well, since shipping costs on international editions can sometimes cause the overall price of the book to shoot up.

 A vacuum cleaner, broom, and mop should all be on your college shopping list.

 You will almost always need to wash your own clothes. Stock up on laundry detergent and invest in a hamper.


Buy a collapsible hamper to save room.

Board games and card games are a great, inexpensive option. You can also bring a video game console, but do so at your own risk, since this could be stolen if you leave your room unlocked and unattended.
Buy supplies for outdoor fun, too, like rollerblades, a frisbee, or a basketball.

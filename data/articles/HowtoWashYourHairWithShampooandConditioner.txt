 Firstly brush your hair, and then comb it, making sure there are no knots.;
, Next, loosen dirt and dead skin by massaging your scalp for a minute. Use the pads of your fingers, not the nails.
 Thoroughly wet your hair with warm — not hot — water. Very hot water damages hair shafts, causing fly-away hair.
 Pour a quarter-sized amount of shampoo into your hand, rub it between your palms, and then spread it evenly over your scalp. Using more shampoo than that will strip your hair's natural oils, leading to the frizzy hair.
,,, Rinse the conditioner with warm water, adding a final blast of cold water to seal the cuticles, which makes hair really shine.
 Gently squeeze out excess water with a clean towel, then wrap the towel around your head and let it absorb some more water before combing your hair. Hair is at its weakest and most prone to breakage when it's soaking wet.
 Spray on a little detangler or leave-in conditioner before combing your hair.

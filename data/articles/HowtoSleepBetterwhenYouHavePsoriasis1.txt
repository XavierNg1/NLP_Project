 Most people sleep better in a colder room. If your psoriasis is keeping you up, opt for a cooler temperature to encourage sleep.The optimal temperature for sleep is between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit. Try to get your room around this temperature.If your room tends to be hotter, try running a fan or an air conditioner. You can also open the windows if you live in an area where temperatures drop at night.;
, A darker room is best for sleep. It's especially important to keep your room dark if you go to bed before sunset. Draw your blinds and keep all the lights in your room turned off to encourage quality sleep.Avoid leaving lights on in the hallway or closet, as this can affect sleep.
Try to turn off lights from electronic devices, such as your laptop, television, or cell phone.
 Keep your sheets, pillowcases, and other bedding clean. Dirty bedding can make psoriasis worse, affecting the quality of your sleep.Watch what detergent you use. Some detergents may irritate psoriasis. If you're having a lot of skin irritation at night, try switching your detergent to see if this helps.
 It's a good idea to have the cream you use for your psoriasis on hand. If you start to feel itchy or irritated, you can quickly apply cream during the night. This will prevent you from needing to get up, which can disrupt your sleep cycle. Keep a bottle of your chosen cream somewhere near your bedside at night.

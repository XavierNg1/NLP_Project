 Navigate to the photo that you're tagged in. You can use the Photos section of your Profile, or open the Activity Monitor to see when you've been tagged. Open the image so that it opens in a new window.


It used to be possible to select multiple photos to untag at once, but Facebook has changed its interface and this is no longer possible. Photos must be untagged one by one.;
, At the bottom of the photo, you will see a few different options, including "Tag Photo", "Options", "Share", "Send", and "Like". Click the "Options" button.
 You will be informed that your tag will be removed but that the picture will still appear in feeds and searches. Click "Okay" to remove the tag.
 If the photo you are tagged in is offensive, you can report it to Facebook. Click the "I don't like this photo" option in the Options menu, and select the reason you feel it should be removed from Facebook. The photo will be reviewed by Facebook staff and they will remove it if they feel that it meets the criteria for removal.

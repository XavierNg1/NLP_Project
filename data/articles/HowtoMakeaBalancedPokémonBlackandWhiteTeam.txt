 Go to the Unova Pokédex, and figure out what Pokémon you like most from each type. This will help you for your team members.;
, You'll get a starter and a monkey in the game, so those two Pokémon are already decided. If you started with Tepig and Pansage, good Water-type(s) would be: Tympole, Tirtouga, or Frillish. If you started with Snivy and Panpour, good Fire-type(s) would be: Darumaka, Litwick, or Heatmor. If you started with Oshawott or Pansear, good Grass-type(s) would be: Sewaddle, Deerling, Ferroseed, Petilil, or Cottonee.
 A flying type is important, because the Flying-types in Unova are pretty formidable fighters. The main reason is, though it's because most of them can learn the HM Fly which allows you to fly from town to town. Good Flying-types that can learn HM fly (in their evolutions) are: Pidove, Vullaby, Rufflet, Archen, Sigilyphl, Woobat, or Ducklett.
 You might have Pokémon with double types like Bisharp, a Dark and Steel-type. Good Dark-types are: Pawniard, Zorua, Deino, Scraggy, or Purrloin. Good Dragon-types are: Axew or Druddigon. Good Ice-types are: Vanilite, Cubchoo, or Cryogonal. Good Ground-types are: Drilbur, Stunfisk, or sandile. Good Fighting-types are: Timbur. Good Rock-types are: Roggenrola.
 Try Joltik, or Tynamo for Electric, Trubbish, for Poison, Klink for Steel, or Venipede, Dwebble, Karrablast, Shelmet, and Larvesta for Bug. You can also get Gothita, Munna, Solosis, or Elgyem for Psychic. Good Ghost-types are: Yamask. Some Normal-types are Lillipup, Patrat, Audino, Minccino, or Bouffalant.
 As an example, we will post our team: Haxorus, Emboar, Gothitelle, Simisage, Mandibuzz, and Seismitoad.

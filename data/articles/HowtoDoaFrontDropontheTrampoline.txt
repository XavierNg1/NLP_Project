, Your elbows should be out to the side.
 Keep your face towards the trampoline. Do not move your hands, but kick your legs and hips back with a small bounce and land in the front drop position as described above. Always kick backwards while doing this jump.


From a standing position without any bounce, jump onto your hand and knees then kick back into a front drop. You can do as many hands and knees bounces in the middle as you wish but try to decrease the number each time you do it.
If you can not understand the 'backward' motion,? go to the end of the trampoline, within a foot of the edge and look over the edge. Then perform the front drop! You see, your brain wonâ€™t allow you to throw yourself off the trampoline and land on your head. It will force you to move backwards, thus eliminating any pain from jarring your back.
 Try to get your chest to land just behind where your feet are.
 It then takes a lot of core and strength to lift you up to your feet. The good thing is that once you have mastered the backwards (no pain) motion, you can practice and practice until you are higher and higher.

 It may be wise to take a step back and truly assess the context of an accolade you are suspicious of. Did you overhear the compliment? If you did, it’s a chance the person was actually being genuine.


Think about it. There’s no reason for the person to use sarcasm or false flattery if you weren’t even meant to hear the remark. If you heard others exchanging nice words about you, consider that they were earnest.
 Most compliments that are disingenuous fall into a few categories. They are made in tones of mockery; they are over-the-top; they are inappropriate for the relationship; or they occur too frequently. If the praise you received meets any of these criteria, you may need to pay closer attention to this person., Consider whether the behavior is out of the norm for the person. If so, then they may have an agenda. You can sniff out an underlying agenda after receiving praise by determining what the other person could possibly have to gain. Think about your interactions with this person over the past several days or weeks. Study the person to determine what their motives might be. Has something occurred between you and this person that would warrant groveling, or worse envy?


False flattery is more likely to occur after a fall out when the person is seeking forgiveness, or when you are in a position of status and the person is hoping for a leg up.Similarly, insincere praise may also arise in the midst of competitive workplaces or after you have received recognition the other person was coveting.

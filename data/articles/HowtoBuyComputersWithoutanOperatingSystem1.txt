 Building a barebones system can be a cost effective option, allowing more advanced users to save 30 to 50 percent over the cost of a pre-assembled system. A barebones system can be customized to suit your specific needs. This method is a good option for those who wish to avoid the proprietorial restrictions computer manufacturers place on service contracts.;
, Building a barebones system requires a certain level of expertise, exceeding that of the average user. The typical barebones system may only include a power supply, motherboard and case. Various components will have to be installed, such as an optical drive, RAM memory, video cards, audio cards and hard drives.


Remember that, typically, no technical support contract or warranty will be included with the purchase of a barebones system. Additionally, no operating system or software bundle will be included, which can raise the price of a barebones system to exceed that of a pre-assembled system. Keep in mind the price issue can be completely resolved if you use Linux.

 Don't just pick the cutest puppy of a litter. Check the puppy's temperament before adopting it. German Shepherds are prized for their aloofness, patience and independence.


A German Shepherd puppy should be approachable, quietly stay where it is, and show its willingness to meet you with body language, like tail wagging.
Try putting it on its back gently. The puppy should resist a bit but not aggressively.
 Do they have the spirit and personality that you are looking for? Are they overly hyper or way to shy? These qualities can last into adulthood.
 Although German Shepherds tend to bond most strongly with one owner, they can also form close personal relationships with each member of the family.
 A puppy can seem perfectly healthy but may have health issues that are not visible yet. Don't get overly excited about the puppy and forget to do things properly. This could lead to problems down the line.


Make sure the puppy has had proper medical care since birth and that there are records of that care that can be provided to you.
Also check the ancestor names on the title, if you are getting a purebred dog from a breeder, to make sure there are no duplicates, which would indicate inbreeding and could lead to health problems down the line.

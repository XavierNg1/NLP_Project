 Use a pocket knife to poke two small holes in the lip of one side of the roasting pan.


Ask an adult to do this step.
Choose one of the shorter ends. This will now be the top of your gong.
The holes should be 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) apart.
The tip of a scissors blade could also be used instead of a pocket knife.;
, Place one pipe cleaner into each hole. Securely twist the ends of each pipe cleaner together.


Each pipe cleaner should form a loop with the ends twisted together. You'll need two loops (one in each hole).
The loops should be 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) in diameter.
 Slide the cardboard tube of a wrapping paper roll or paper towel roll through the pipe cleaner loops, centering the loops on the tube.


You could use a broomstick, measuring stick, or other large stick instead of the cardboard tube if desired. Just make sure that the stick itself is longer than the width of your roasting pan gong.
This tube or stick will act as the support for your gong.
 Place two desk or dining room chairs back to back. Rest the support on the back tops of both chairs so that the gong hangs in place.


For added security, you could hold the support in place using more pipe cleaners.
Alternatively, you could use two large, thick books or any other evenly sized sturdy pieces instead of the chairs. This "stand" needs to be able to stay in place without additional support, though.
 Wrap electrical tape around one end of the chopstick, overlapping the tape until it forms a thick mass.


Instead of a chopstick, you could also use a wooden spoon or 12-inch (30.5-cm) wooden dowel.
The taped portion of the stick will be the head of your beater. The head should be about 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) thick.
 To play the gong, simply strike the bottom, flat side of the roasting pan with the head of your beater.

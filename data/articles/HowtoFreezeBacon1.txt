 You want to have enough wax paper to spread out your entire package of bacon with a couple inches between each piece.You can also use parchment paper., Be sure your counter is clean and free of crumbs.
 With your fingers or tongs, place one piece of bacon on one end of the wax paper.Smooth the bacon flat.
 Create a crease so that your bacon stays put.


Your first slice of bacon is now covered with wax paper on both sides.
 Place it directly on top of the wax paper covering the top of your first slice.,


You are essentially creating an accordion fold around each slice of bacon so that they are individually wrapped.Continue this process until all your bacon is folded into the wax paper.
 Place your wax paper-wrapped bacon stack in the bottom of the bag and use your arm to flatten the rest of the bag against the counter. Be sure to squeeze all the air out of the bag.Write the date on your freezer bag so that you remember how long you have stored it.

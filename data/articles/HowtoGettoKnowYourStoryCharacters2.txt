 These scenes don’t necessarily need to end up in your story; they are just meant to help you get to know your characters better. These scenes could involve another character asking the character you are trying to get to know about themselves.


You could also create scenes where a character is presented with an interesting situation. Your goal is to determine what the character would do next, given his or her personality.
 One scene you could create is one where you (or a different character) begin to interview the character you are trying to get to know. For instance, you could create a journalist character to interview the character you are learning more about.


Pose questions to your character on paper (either directly or through another character’s voice). Answer these questions in the voice and style of the character you are trying to understand.
Take notes and add details to your character’s biography page as you expand the character more.
 Imagine how your character would react in different situations. What does that reaction tell you about him or her? Include those characteristics on his or her character page. You can use a scene from your everyday life, find one online, or just make something up, such as:


“Your character walks into a bar to find a woman totally naked sitting at the bar. No one is paying her any attention. What does your character do next?”.
Another idea is: “Your character is sitting alone at bench. A car drives slowly by, and something is thrown out of the car. What does your character do next?”
Or: “Your character is alone at night and hears a noise outside. He finds a small kitten sitting on the porch, obviously malnourished. What does your character do with the kitten?”

 You need to get your barrel close enough to the bottom of the downspout and have enough room under the spigot to fill a barrel.
 Four cinder blocks set next to each other should do the trick on flat ground. You can also use loose bricks. Make sure your stand is completely stableâ€”you don't want your barrel to tip.
 You may need to adjust your downspout and even add curved sections of gutter piping to get it properly positioned.
 Make sure it sits secure and stable and doesn't tip around. Turn it so the end of your house's downspout flows down into the intake.

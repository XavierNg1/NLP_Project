 Use a dull knife, such as a butter knife. This is to make sure the carpet doesn’t get cut up as you try to clean it. Scrape off as much honey as you can, wiping the knife off on a paper towel after each pass. The more you can get off here, the easier the stain will be to clean up., Use liquid dish soap rather than powdered dish detergent. The former will dissolve better in water, making for a better cleaning solution. Mix the solution in a large bowl, or even a bucket., You can use a sponge or a rag, dipped in cleaning solution. Use it to sponge and dab the honey, but make sure not to rub. Rubbing the honey will rub it deeper into the carpet fibers, making the whole thing harder to clean., Once the stain is covered with soapy water, use a clean rag to soak it up. Keep a bucket on hand to wring the rag. Repeat this sponging and absorbing process until the stain is removed., Make sure you only use water to wet this cloth. Dab the area with the cloth to remove any cleaning solution that might have been left behind. Not cleaning up the soap properly will leave you with a carpet that attracts more dirt and grime., Use a clean rag to soak up any leftover water or soap. Make sure you don’t leave any liquid soaking the carpet. Otherwise you risk mold and mildew forming underneath it.

 Play plenty of fun games but always try to improve your skills. Skills such as aiming and moving may seem simple but make all the difference in the end.;
, Use the noob combo (Plasma Pistol and Battle Rifle), use power weapons, and exploit every aspect of the game. Some combos such as Magnum+SMG are suited for close range. Single weapons such as the Battle Rifle and Sniper Rifle are long range weapons.
 This is a personal preference. If you like close and fast battles, then a higher setting will suit you. The opposite is true for sniper lovers.
 Find out good places on Lockout to lob grenades to various key points. Know how a plasma grenade arcs so you can stick well in clutch situations. In most matchmaking game types, you start with 2 frags, so practice bouncing and throwing them to the enemy.
 Otherwise, a Rocket Launcher or Plasma Grenade will destroy you.
 Some players love to hide behind corners and remain crouched. Others have the analog stick pushed to the edge the entire game. Both styles have pros and cons. Try them.
 Talk with your team. Even chit-chat is useful for goading them into useful communication. Report every enemy sighting and keep your ears open to weapon locations.
 The best way to improve is to play against people who match your skill level. Team-based skills are hard to get from matchmaking by yourself.
 Too many players say they want to get better, but don't make an effort to. Next time you turn on the Xbox, make a goal to only use plasma grenades in one game, or to no-scope whenever you have the sniper rifle. Such limits can be fun but they also help your skills.

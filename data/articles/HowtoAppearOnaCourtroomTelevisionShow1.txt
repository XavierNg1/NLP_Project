 You will need to make sure the opposite party (plaintiff or defendant) also agrees to drop their claim and settle their dispute in the televised courtroom of a celebrity judge. If you have any questions or concerns about the conditions of bringing your small-claims case to a TV show versus a real courtroom, consider speaking to a reputable lawyer or other legal adviser.;
, Are you willing to have your case viewed by potentially millions of people? Remember that generally everything you say and do during the case will be televised, and anything demeaning to yourself can have long-lasting ramifications. Do you feel you can maintain a proper dialogue with the presiding judge? Some are patient and humorous; others are renown for their candor and hotheadedness.
 Nowadays, submissions can be made online on the website of the courtroom TV show in addition to by snail mail. Be as thorough and descriptive as possible in your submission about yourself and the case, at least if you want to be taken seriously, and carefully read all of the terms of appearing on the show and how it may affect the litigation.
 Once you submit your case, allow at least a few days to several weeks for it to be reviewed and to receive a response.
 The more materials you can present, the better. Most judges will not be happy with you if you do not bring any materials to back up or explain your side of the claim.
 Start by getting a haircut (if necessary) and finding something appropriate to wear. If you are presenting yourself professionally, your odds at the case being ruled in your favor are that much greater. Take a flight or drive to the city in which the courtroom studio is located, and do not arrive late.
 Be polite and respectful, and answer all of the judge's questions to the best of your ability. Speak clearly and legibly at all times.
 This may include signing paperwork, a meeting with the producers, etc.

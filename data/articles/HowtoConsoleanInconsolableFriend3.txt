 If your friend appears to have moved on from their loss or grief, then that probably means that they are healing from their pain. However, it is still important to check on them to see how they’re doing. Don't assume they are doing better simply because they tell you that they are.
 Your friend might say they are doing better, but are they really doing well? Or are they covering up depression and simply trying to avoid people's pity or judgement? It's important to determine which is the case.


When you follow up with your friend look for clues about how they're really doing. Are they keeping their room or home reasonably clean? Are they showering? Are they doing as well in school or at work as they did before their grief? If not, they may not have fully moved on., Don’t burden your friend with your personal expectations for getting over grief. Whether it’s losing a loved one or losing a job, everyone copes differently and requires different lengths of time to move on from a loss.


Let your friend know that's it's perfectly fine to take as much time as they need to grieve. This is comforting because you aren't forcing an expectation that they need to "get over it," this will help them feel supported during their grieving process.
 If you have tried to console your friend on multiple occasions over a long period of time, it might be time to suggest that they seek professional counseling. This is a sensitive subject, so it is vital to avoid sounding judgmental when you make this suggestion. Instead, express your concern that they don’t seem to be improving. See this article for tips on how to Choose a Therapist., Assisting with any obstacles to getting to therapy appointments, such as transportation or childcare during the appointment, is a great way to help your friend. If these concerns are taken care of, they are more likely to schedule and keep their appointment.

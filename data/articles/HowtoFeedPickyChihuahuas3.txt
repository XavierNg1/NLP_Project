 One of the most common causes of picky eating in dogs is feeding your dog human food, especially from your plate. This means you will need to stop feeding your dog table scraps and restrict your dog’s diet to its proper food.To make your dog’s food more appetizing, pour warm broth over your dog’s dry food before serving. You can also mix in some wet food with the dry food, as well.
Always re-heat any homemade meals before serving them to your dog.
 Indulging your Chihuahua with an excessive amount of treats is also another common reason why dogs become picky eaters. Treats are a lot tastier than regular dog food. Your dog will learn to wait for the treats instead of eating its regular food. Too many treats can also lead to weight issues.Keep a treat jar in your kitchen so you can monitor you many treats are given per week. Give treats only as specific behavioral rewards.
 Stop feeding your dog table scraps and treats, and stick to a daily, scheduled feeding routine instead. Help your dog understand that no options exist. Create a scheduled, feeding routine by:Putting down the proper amount of food at a regular time each day. For example, 8 a.m. and 7 p.m.
Setting out your dog’s food for 30 minutes. If your dog does not eat it, take it away.
Setting out the food again for the next mealtime. Whether it has been eaten or not, take it away after 30 minutes.
Not giving in. Your dog is not starving. If it is hungry, it will eat.
 Make sure your dog’s feeding area is in a quiet, traffic-free area in your house or yard. If your dog’s water and food bowls are in a noisy area, where you and your family members frequently walk, this could be the cause of the picky eating.Place your dog’s bowl in a quiet corner in the kitchen or the laundry room. Also, feed your dog during times that are quiet and calm, like early in the morning or after dinner.

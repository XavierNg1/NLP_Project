 Simply pour a small amount of alcohol into a shallow dish. You want to make sure the bowl is not too deep because you do not want to dip the entire brush into the alcohol., Only dip the bristles into the alcohol and make sure that the barrel of the brush does not get wet. You will notice makeup coming off the brush and the alcohol will likely change colour. Continue to swirl the brush around for approximately 10 to 20 seconds., Remove the bristles from the alcohol and wipe them on a clean towel. The makeup will likely leave a mark on the towel as it is removed from the brush., Dump the used alcohol down the drain and then refill the dish with more alcohol. Dip the brush back into the alcohol and swirl around. Then, pat it dry on the towel. Continue this process until no more makeup comes off the brush in the alcohol solution. This indicates that the brush is clean., Once your brushes are clean, you should squeeze out excess alcohol from the brushes. This will help speed up the drying process. It is also important to reshape the bristles after cleaning. This can help keep your brushes in good condition. Use your fingers to comb the bristles into place.For example, the bristles may splay out from being rubbed on the towel. Use your fingers to collect all the bristles together and ensure they are all facing in the same direction.
 After you have wiped the brush off on the towel, lay it flat to dry. Small brushes will dry very quickly, but larger brushes may take one or more hours to completely dry.

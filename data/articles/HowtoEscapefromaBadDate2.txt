 Tell a friend ahead of time that you are planning to go on a date. Ask them to call you at a pre-arranged time (e.g., 30 minutes into the date) to check in. If the date is going badly, you can pretend that your friend is having an emergency and needs your help right away.For example, when your friend calls, you can say something like, “Oh no, really? I’m on my way!” Tell your date, “I’m so sorry, my friend’s car broke down, and she needs me to come pick her up.”

, Arrange to have a friend show up if things get uncomfortable. Send them a quick text, or step into the bathroom to make a call.When your friend shows up, act surprised and invite them to join you. E.g., “Oh, wow, I haven’t seen you in forever! Hey, why don’t you sit with us for a bit? You’ve got to try this cocktail!”

, Some restaurants and bars offer a “mayday service” for customers stuck on bad dates or feeling unsafe. Call ahead and find out if the place you’re going offers such a service. This can take the form of a code word (e.g., going up to the bar and ordering an “angel shot” or asking to “speak to Angela”).Even if the venue you have chosen does not offer a “mayday service,” you may be able to simply go up to the bar or pull a server aside and quietly ask for assistance.
A staff member may be able to call a cab for you. Or, if your date is behaving really inappropriately or making you feel unsafe, you can ask to have them escorted out or have a staff member call the police for you.

 Are you a sports fan? If so, attend a few local games with someone who can relay what is happening, or where you can listen to a radio broadcast of what is occurring at the same time. While you’re here, make small talk with the people who are sitting near you. Chances are, they have the same interest as you, which can start as a foundation for a potential friendship.


For instance, you can ask the person next to you what they think of a particular athlete’s season so far. Or, if they thought the last call was accurate. This simple small talk may lead to a long-lasting friendship.;
, Look for a group in your area that is focused on a specific subject that interests you. This could be a book club, a political group, or a meeting for those who have the same religious beliefs as you. The Internet is a great starting point to find something in your area.


Before joining a book club, ensure that the members are comfortable with you using audio tapes. Although it may be difficult if the attendees refer to specific pages, you should still be able to join in on the conversation., Learn what is popular among people your age. It’s no secret that you can connect with others when you have mutual interests. Find out what people your age are wearing, listening to, or watching and take an interest.For example, if everyone your age is listening to a new musician, you might download some of their music.When you are in a social setting, you can use this as a conversation starter like "I really enjoy #4 on the album. What's your favorite song?"

, The friendlier you are, the higher the chances of you making friends. In fact, people love talking about themselves and their interests, so all you have to do is get them talking.Show curiosity about the people you meet in your everyday surroundings. If you hear someone singing a song, ask them about the artist. If you smell a lovely scent of perfume, compliment the person and ask them where they purchased it.

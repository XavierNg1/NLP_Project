 This pose might seem challenging at first, but with practice, you'll find it easy enough to do it regularly. Once in full boat, your spine and legs will both be stretched so that you exercise your abs thoroughly. Be aware of your breathing as you settle into this higher intensity position, making sure you inhale quick breaths through your nose. Remember to come out of the position as gently as you came into it, so your abdominals are engaged to their maximum potential.
 This pose aims to assist digestion as well as relaxation, and achieves that by utilizing a mid-body twist that extends your arms to the ground.
 Similar to the triangle pose you just did, this pose requires you to face forward with your right foot and keep your left arm towards the ceiling. The pose raises your heart rate by lowering your upper body toward your lower body and engaging the muscles of your lower back. Reaching down to your feet also increases the flexibility of your lower back and your legs.

 To establish the credibility of a given review, try to establish the credibility of the reviewer. Look at a reviewer’s profile. Is this the first and only review they have ever posted? Also, did they just create the account on the day they posted the review? These can be signs that the review and/or the account is falsified., Look again at a reviewer’s profile. Have they created reviews for other products that sound exactly like this one? Alternatively, if they have posted 3 or more reviews for different products within a couple days of each other, this reviewer is likely being paid to post reviews., Look across a reviewer’s posts and ratings. If they seem to love everything they review, or only give out 5-star ratings, they are probably being paid for these posts. Don’t trust a reviewer who loves everything about every product they rate., A username with three or more numbers at the end is probably an automated bot. Particularly if you see multiple reviews for the same product from reviewers with usernames like this, you will not be able to trust these reviews.

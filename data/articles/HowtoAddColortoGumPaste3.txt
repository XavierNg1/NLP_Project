 Pour water, vodka or gin onto a small plate or rimmed lid totaling the amount of paint you think you will need. Alcohols that do not contain sugar may be chosen because they evaporate more quickly than water. Sugary liquors like rum should not be used because the sugar content makes the gum paste soft and gooey. Using a fresh toothpick, withdraw the desired amount of food coloring paste from the jar and stir it into the liquid. The thicker you mix the "paint," the darker the paint will be. Lighter colors come from thinner paint, but thinner paint can bleed over into undesired areas.
 For better success using colors right next to each other or layering colors, wait for the previous color to dry somewhat before applying the next one.

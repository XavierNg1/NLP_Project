 If you find that you are still stuck in safe mode on Firefox, one of the surefire ways to fix the issue is to just reinstall Firefox. So, go to http://www.mozilla.org and download and save Firefox to your computer.
 Wait for the download to complete, which may take a few minutes. Once is has finished, close out of Firefox. If you have another browser installed on your computer, like Safari or Chrome, you can delete Firefox before downloading it again to avoid confusion. However, if you do not have another browser make sure that you have the installation file for Firefox on your desktop before deleting anything., Now that you have closed out of Firefox and downloaded a new version, you can go back a delete the original one that you have installed on your hard drive. For Windows, go to "Program Files" and then "Mozilla Firefox" and for Mac, go to "Applications" and then "Firefox." Once you have located where it is stored, delete the file.
 To reinstall Firefox, double-click on the installation file on your desktop and follow the installation wizard. Once it has completed installation, select "Finish."

, Once the installation is complete, reopen Firefox and determine whether or not it is still in safe mode.

 Extra weight puts unnecessary stress on your dog’s already damaged joints. By keeping them at a healthy weight, you can help to eliminate this additional source of stress and pain. Because your dog cannot exercise like they would if they didn’t have arthritis, maintaining a healthy diet is your best bet to keep them at a healthy weight.Dogs that are a healthy weight will also have an easier time exercising than will an overweight dog.
A healthy diet should provide a balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Avoid feeding your dog table scraps, since human food is often more calorically dense. Limit the number of treats you give your pet.
 While this might not always be possible, try to exercise your dog on soft surfaces whenever possible. Soft surfaces, like grass, put less stress on your dog’s joints than hard surfaces, like asphalt., If your dog is in a lot of pain, talk to your vet about what medications might be right for your dog. Your vet will most likely prescribe an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) that will help to combat pain and reduce swelling. Pain management medications can make exercise much more comfortable for your dog.These medications are prescription only; do not self-medicate your dog.
 It can also help prevent further joint damage in some dogs. When dogs are stressed, especially due to physical stress caused by conditions like arthritis, they can be prone to a Vitamin C deficiency.Talk to your vet about Vitamin C supplements to see if they think it would help your dog., Certain medications can help prevent further joint damage by maintaining joint health. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate both help to repair connective tissue and keep already existing cartilage healthy. Arthritis will degrade your dog's joints, but these medicines can help to slow this process.Talk to your vet before you give your dog any additional supplements or medications.
These medicines will not repair any structural damage caused by arthritis, like torn cartilage or advanced scar tissue. These can only be corrected through surgery.

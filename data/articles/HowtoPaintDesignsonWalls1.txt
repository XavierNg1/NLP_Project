 If the wall is dirty, the paint may not stick to it. Wash the wall using a microfiber cloth and a solution made of one part mild dish soap and four parts warm water. Dry the wall afterwards with a clean cloth., Spread a drop cloth, some newspapers, cardboard, or a plastic tarp down on the floor where you will be working. This is to catch any paint drips or spills and protect your floor. You will also want to have all your paints, brushes, tape, and paper towels handy.
 Put on a painter's smock or some old clothes that you don't mind getting dirty. If you have very sensitive skin, you might want to consider putting on a pair of vinyl or latex gloves, although most acrylic paints are considered to be safe and non-toxic.
 If you are planning on using stencils for the first time, you might want to practice on a piece of cardboard first. This will allow you to get the feel for your foam roller or stencil brush first. It will also allow you to develop the right technique before you move onto your actual wall.You can even paint the cardboard the same color as your wall first. This will not only give you a similar texture, but it will also give you an idea of how the final colors will look like,

, This can be the same color as before, or a whole new color. Be sure to use an indoor latex house paint. Keep in mind, however, that if you are using reverse stencils, the color you are using right now will be the color of your shapes or designs.

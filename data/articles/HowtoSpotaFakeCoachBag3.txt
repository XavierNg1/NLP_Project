 While they aren’t the most expensive bags comparatively, Coach bags can still be anywhere between $200-$600. Even the used bags can retail for a hefty price. If a new coach bag is selling for a cheap price, that's a good sign that it's a fake. Keep in mind the actual pricing of the bag you want and compare it the one you're considering buying. Are they similar?

, If a vendor avoids your questions, looks guilty, or gives vague answers when you ask about the authenticity of a bag, it's a good sign that you should be wary. Ask if they accept returns. If they don't they may not be credible.


If the vendor has a lot of the same type of bag, this is also a red flag as it usually means they’re replicas. Inspect the material in this instance. Are the bags made of fabric or cheap leather?

, If the bag holds up and wears nicely, it shows that the bag is authentic or at the very least well-made. A broken, torn bag by the end of a few weeks shows that the bag is most likely a fake. Coach bags are made from quality materials, so frayed threads, cracked leather, and warping from use are going to take a while -- probably a few years.

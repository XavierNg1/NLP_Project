 Every building should have the name of the technician, either in the office or in the elevator itself.
 They will stop the elevators, and then open up the space beneath the elevators. Then they will grab your keys for you.
 In the USA it is about $75 to $300.
 If you are not in a rush, you can wait till their next scheduled service (usually a few times a year). They would normally not charge you for that.

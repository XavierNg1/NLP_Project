 This method will work on all versions of Windows beginning with Windows 7. To reset a Windows XP password, see Retrieve Passwords in Windows XP.
 If you type the wrong password, you’ll see an error that says “Username or password is incorrect.” Click “OK.”

,, In the menu, you’ll see a list of disk drives on the computer. Select the location of your password reset disc and click next.
 Choose something that you’ll remember. Type it again to confirm, then click “Next” to continue. You can also type a hint in the box below “Type a new password hint.” The hint should be something that jogs your memory in case you lose your password in the future. This is optional, but may be helpful.
 You’ll be returned to the login screen, where you’ll be able to log back into the computer with your username and new password.

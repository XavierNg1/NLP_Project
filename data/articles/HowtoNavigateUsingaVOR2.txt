 You can find the direction of an airway on either a VFR or IFR chart. Set the radial's direction into the OBS and turn the aircraft to fly that heading. Once established on the heading, note the position of the CDI. If it is to the right, your radial is to the right. Likewise, if it is left, the radial is left.;
, Turn 30 degrees in the direction of the CDI to intercept the course. Although 30° is most common and easy to use, you can use any intercept angle. For instance, if you are far enough from the desired course, it may take more than 30° to intercept the course before reaching your destination.
 As the CDI moves close to the center, turn your heading to match the radial. Keep the needle centered to stay on the radial. If the needle starts drifting left, turn left to get back on course.


Tracking inbound (towards the station) and outbound (away from the station) radials is exactly the same, except you should get a TO indication when flying inbound and a FROM indication when flying outbound on a radial. (Aircraft heading opposite the direction of the radial will experience “reverse sensing” which is the CDI indicating right when the radial is to the left, and indicating left when the radial is to the right).
 If you find yourself blown off the radial by the wind, note the amount of deflection, then intercept the radial by turning the aircraft towards the radial twice as many degrees as the deflection. When the needle centers, turn only halfway back to the original heading to provide a wind correction angle (WCA).

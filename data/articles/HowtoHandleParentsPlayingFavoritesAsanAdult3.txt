 Ask yourself whether Mom was always closest to one of your sisters, or whether Dad never got along with you. If your parents favored or disfavored some of their children years ago, it’s natural for the pattern to continue into your adulthood.Just because it’s a long-standing habit doesn’t make your parents’ favoritism right. However, looking at the past might make it easier to understand why the behavior is happening now.
It may also be helpful to look at the ways in which your parents were raised. It could offer insight and perhaps even empathy. If, for example, they grew up in a family where one child was favored, it may be the only family dynamic they know or understand.
 Some parents favor their children because they live nearby, share similar lifestyles and values, or have similar personalities. Other parents’ favoritism is based on financial worries about one of their children. Consider whether any of these factors could be playing a role in your parents’ behavior.For example, if you are an engineer and your brother is a teacher, your parents’ monetary gifts to him might be an attempt to level the playing field between the two of you.
 Parental favoritism can sting if you’re not the favored child. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean they love you any less than your siblings – proximity and circumstance may have more to do with their behavior.Try to look at the situation from your parents’ perspective. You may find it unfair that they bought your sibling a house, for instance, but maybe they would have felt guilty if they hadn’t given their least financially successful child a helping hand.

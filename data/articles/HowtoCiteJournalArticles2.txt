 Citing an online journal is similar to citing a print journal, with a few exceptions:


Include website title.
Specify "web" instead of "print."
Include date website was accessed.
 In practice, the above structure should lend itself to a citation that looks like this:


Last, First M. "Article Title" Journal Title Series Volume. Issue (Year Published): Page(s). Website Title. Web. Date Month Year Accessed.

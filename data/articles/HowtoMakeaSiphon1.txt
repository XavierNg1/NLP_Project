 For this project, you'll need: at least 10' of 5/8" by 7/8" vinyl tubing, an empty clear plastic bottle, a 1/2" ball valve, three 1/2" male hose adapters, and plumber's tape.


You can always use more than 10' of 5/8" by 7/8" vinyl tubing if you need your siphon to be longer than 10'.
These can all be found in a hardware store, usually the irrigation section.
You'll also need scissors, a wrench, and a lighter.;
, First, take off any labels on the plastic bottle. Wash it out if it had something besides water in it. Drill a 3/4" hole in the cap of the bottle. The easiest way to do this is with the cap still on the bottle, tightly screwed., Stick the thick end of one of the 1/2" male hose adapters in the hole you drilled in the cap.
 Use scissors to cut off approximately two inches of the bottom of the bottle. Use a lighter to heat up the edges of the cut. Just run the flame along the edge to strengthen the plastic.
 First, wrap a few layers of plumber's tape around the thick ends of the remaining two 1/2" male hose adapters. Then thread them into both ends of the ball valve. Use a wrench to make them tight.
 Use your scissors to cut 3' to 4' of tubing. Attach one end of this 3' to 4' tube to the male hose adapter connected to the bottle, and attach the other end to one of the male hose adapters on the ball valve. Attach one end of the remaining tubing to the last male hose adapter.








The function of the ball valve is to give you the ability to stop and start the siphoning without having to put your mouth back on the tube that's been in dirty water.

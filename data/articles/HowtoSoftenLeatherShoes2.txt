 Don’t try to use regular alcoholic beverages to soften your leather shoes; you’ll only end up making them smell like booze.
 The amount you’ll need depends on your shoe. If you have a tall shoe or boot, you’ll need more than if you have a shoe that only extends to your ankle. Dip a cotton ball in the alcohol and rub it all over your leather shoe wherever exposed leather is visible. Remove the laces, if present, to apply the alcohol to the exposed leather on the tongue and on the inside of the shoe. Let it sit and dry for about thirty minutes., Use a small brush or an old toothbrush to work the Vaseline into the shoe. Apply the Vaseline in such a way that only a thin layer is left on the shoe. Let the shoes sit overnight. After allowing the shoes to sit and soften, wipe them down with a dry cloth to remove any excess Vaseline.


If your shoes have not as soft as you’d like after a single coat, repeat the process again until your shoes are as soft as you want them to be. Sometimes you’ll need to apply several coats to reach the level of softness you want.
 A variation of the above method involves skipping the alcohol altogether and going straight to the Vaseline-rubbing step. After doing so, instead of allowing the shoes to sit overnight, take a hot curling iron and move it slowly around inside the shoe. Start at the heal and work your way slowly down the sides of the shoe where you applied the Vaseline. The heat will help the pores of the leather open up and better absorb the thin layer of Vaseline you’ve applied.

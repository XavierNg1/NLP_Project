 If you haven't done so already, turn off both the TV and DVR before connecting them.


Both devices can be plugged into a power source during the process. Just make sure that the devices are powered down while you connect them.
 Plug the green, blue, and red connectors of the component cable into their matching Component In ports on the back or side of the TV.Plug the green connector to the green Y port, the blue connector to the blue Pb port, and the red connector to the red Pr port.
 The other end of the component cable should also have green, blue, and red connectors. Plug each of these into their matching Component Out ports on the back of the DVR.


As before, the green connector plugs into the green Y port, the blue connector plugs into the blue Pb port, and the red connector plugs into the red Pr port.
 You'll need to use a separate L/R audio cable for the audio. Connect the plugs on one end of this cable into their matching Audio In ports on the back of the TV.


Plug the red connector into the red Audio In Right port and the white connector into the white Audio In Left connector.
 The connectors at the other end of the same L/R audio cable should be plugged into the matching Audio Out ports on the back of the DVR.


You'll need to insert the red plug into the red Audio Out Right port and the white plug into the white Audio Out Left port.
 The DVR and TV should now be connected. Turn both pieces of equipment back on and switch the TV to the necessary input source to watch content from the DVR.


Scroll through the input options by pressing the "Source" or "Input" button on your TV or remote control. Stop once a picture appears on the TV screen. Usually, this will be the "Video" option.

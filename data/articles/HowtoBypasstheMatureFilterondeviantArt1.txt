 You'll see a "Mature Content Filter is On" message instead of the picture. This method lets you see the thumbnail of the image, which by default is just a smaller version of the image itself. Some artists create a custom thumbnail instead, so this method will work for most, but not all images.;
, Scroll down and look at the right-hand bar until you see the word Thumb. The box below that will have an ID number in it. Ignore any letters and symbols, and copy the numbers. For example, if it says :thumb12345678:, copy 12345678.
 Visit sno.ms/devart and enter the ID to view the image. You can also do this manually in a new browser tab:


Copy-paste this into the address bar: http://backend.deviantart.com/embed/view.swf?id=Add the ID number you just copied after the URL
Hit enter to load the page.
 You're viewing the thumbnail as an .swf file, which is not convenient for most purposes. To save the image, take a screenshot.

 Once baked, cut the cake into mini circles and stack three marshmallows onto the cake. Use icing as a glue.

The circles shouldn't be too small, just enough to fit three marshmallows on top.
 Using the same melting method as marshmallow kebabs, melt the chocolate in a microwave for 30 seconds. The microwave should also be at the lowest heat otherwise the chocolate will burn., Let the chocolate set and become hard. You could also place the chocolate into the fridge to set for about an hour or two., After, put the hardened compound chocolate underneath the cake and melt your regular chocolate using the microwave method., Once cooled pour it into the centre of the cake where you made the hole and add some mini marshmallows., Place the cake on a plate if not already on one and scoop some ice cream on the side. You can also drizzle melted chocolate over the cake and serve.

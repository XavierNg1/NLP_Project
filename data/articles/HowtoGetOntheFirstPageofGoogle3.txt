 Backlinks are when another website, preferably one that gets more hits than yours, links to your page. Find websites that are in the same vein as yours and see if they'd be willing to do some cross promotion. You can also contact relevant blogs and ask about guest posting, giving you another chance to link to your site.


Remember, you want these backlinks to be quality. Google can tell the difference. Do not spam comment sections trying to build backlinks for yourself. You will be docked for this behavior.
 Social media like and shares are rewarded more than ever these days with Google, especially with subjects that are currently relevant. This means that you should create social media accounts and try to build a base of followers who will like your pages and share them with friends. Remember: the trick is to not be spammy!


Keep interacting with your customers online so that they can feel valued. Try to respond to the reviews as this would be appreciated by the customers. Retweet and repost your good reviews.
 Update your website regularly. Google rewards sites which see regular maintenance and updates. This means if you've been ignoring your website since 2005, you're in trouble. Find small ways to update it: new pricing, news posts every couple of months, photos from events, etc.

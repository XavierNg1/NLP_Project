 In order to watch live TV from Dish on your iPad (or other mobile device) you will need to make sure that your set-top box has Sling. Fortunately, almost all new subscribers are given the Hopper with Sling. If you have the 1st generation Hopper or another box, you might have to purchase a Sling Adapter. (This costs $50 on Amazon.);
, Now that we know your set-top box is ready, it's time download the app. Go to the App Store (or Google Play on Android devices) and search for Dish Anywhere. Download the app!

, Once you've downloaded the app to your smart phone or tablet, you'll have to log in using your Dish ID. Unfortunately, this great app is only available to subscribers who pay for Dish. If you don't have a Dish ID, then you can create one using your account number or phone number by clicking Create Account.
 You're in! After logging in, you will see a lot of options for watching video-on-demand. By clicking the Live TV button in the upper hand right hand corner. When you do this, you are creating a connection back to your home set-top box. The live video is sent directly from your home to your device.

 Spray down your tool’s business end with your garden hose once you’ve finished using it. Blast away dirt, sap, and other debris. If needed, follow up by scrubbing it down with a wire brush. Then either towel it off or let it air-dry when you’re done., If your hose isn’t enough to get rid of a heavy build-up of sap, fill a bucket or other container with enough turpentine to submerge the sappy part of your tool. Dip your tool into it and then scrub with a wire brush. For very heavy build-ups, let it soak for a few minutes before scrubbing so the turpentine can penetrate the sap., Fill a bucket or container with vinegar. Give it a few minutes to soak, then remove and scrub with a wire brush. If needed, let it soak for longer if the rust is very pervasive., Soak a cloth in linseed oil. Rub it over the handle to coat it evenly. Prevent the wood from drying and splitting. Do so before the winter months to keep the handle safe during non-use and then as needed to sterilize the handle in between uses.Linseed oil can combust in extreme temperatures, so dispose of used cloths wisely. Do not ball them up after use. Instead, hang them to air-dry in between uses. If you’re going to store them or throw them away in any sort of container, soak them in water first., Expect moisture to damage tools. Do not leave them outside or on the ground. Mount a pegboard on the wall of your garage or shed to hang them so they don’t touch the floor. If this isn’t possible:Fill a bucket with sand. As you do, add enough linseed oil to dampen all of it. Once they’ve dried after cleaning, store your tools with their business ends planted in the mixture.

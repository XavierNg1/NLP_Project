 In this facility, you are not allowed to use your own Pokémon. Instead, you are provided with rental Pokémon. This facility tests how knowledgeable you are about battling, as well as type matchups. If you win all 7 battles, you will have cleared a set., Before the challenge begins, a scientist on behalf of the facility will take your Pokémon and give you 6 to choose between. From these 6, you may rent 3. Be sure to go through each of the Pokémon’s summaries in order to formulate the most effective team possible. Consider the types, Abilities, movesets and held items., Before a battle (excluding the one with the Frontier Brain), a scientist will inform you of the upcoming opponent’s battling style. Based on what is said, the opponent will have Pokémon that knows certain moves.

For example, an opponent that "appears to be high risk, high return" will most likely have Pokémon with moves that are powerful, but either have poor accuracy or high recoil damage.
Be flexible. After you defeat a Trainer, you are given the option of switching one of your Pokémon with that of your defeated opponent before proceeding to the next battle. Again, consider your Pokémon strategy and decide accordingly. This can determine how the following battle will turn out.
 The Frontier Brain of the Battle Factory is known as Noland, the Factory Head. He is challenged at the 21st and 42nd battle in a streak (Silver and Gold Symbol, respectively). This means that for the Silver challenge, Noland will be the final Trainer of the 3rd consecutive set. For the Gold challenge, he will be the final Trainer of the 7th consecutive set. Like you, he will also use random Pokémon. Once he is defeated, he will award the respective Knowledge Symbol.

 First, take a ping pong ball, and make a small hole. This can be done with anything sharp and small. Unfold the large paper clip and form it to make an appropriate stand. Stick the paper clip into the hole in the ball., Put down some newspaper beneath the ping-pong ball so that the paint doesn't stain your workstation. Use a metallic gold spray paint cover your ball with at least two coats. Let it dry., Take the other ping pong ball, and cut it in half, using either an exacto knife, a kitchen knife, or scissors. Draw a swirl pattern on each half of the ball that mirror each other. With a small pair of scissors, carefully cut out the swirl patterns. Paint the swirl patterns and the ping-pong halves, and let them dry. Use plain white craft glue to stick the cut-out swirls back to the ping-pong halves, somewhere where the cut-outs don't overlap with the holes in the ping-pong halves., Cut out the plain paper into two identical wing shapes. The easiest way to do this is to fold the paper in half and cut both wings out at once.


You can do the wings as you like, but an idea is to cut out 2 appropriately-sizes half circles, and then cut "flaps" out of the straight sides, to make feathers., Glue the cut-out half-ping pong balls to the actual ball on the stand. Put some glue on the end of each wing, and tuck it in the swirls. Hold it together for a few seconds so that they stays on. Let the glue dry before you remove your finished snitch from its stand.

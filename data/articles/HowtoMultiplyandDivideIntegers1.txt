 An integer is any whole number that can be represented without using a fraction or decimal. Integers can be positive, negative, or zero. For instance, the following numbers are integers: 1, 99, -217, and 0. However, these numbers are not: -10.4, 6 Â¾, 2.12.


Absolute values can be integers, but they are not necessarily. An absolute value of any number is the "size" or "amount" of the number, regardless of its sign. Another way to put this is that a given number's absolute value is that number's distance from zero. So, the absolute value of an integer is always an integer. For example, the absolute value of -12 is 12. The absolute value of 3 is 3. The absolute value of 0 is 0.

The absolute values of numbers that are not integers, however, will never be integers. For example, the absolute value of 1/11 is 1/11 - a fraction, and therefore not an integer.
 The process of multiplying or dividing integers, whether they're large or small, is much, much quicker and easier if you have memorized the products of every pair of numbers from 1 to 10. This information is usually referred to in school as "times tables". As a refresher, below is a basic 10X10 times table. The numbers across the top and left side of the table list the numbers from 1 to 10. To find the product of two of these numbers, find the cell where the row and column of your two desired numbers intersect:

 If you are a YouTube Red subscriber, you'll be able to save videos on the Android app for viewing while offline. This is the only official way to save videos for offline use, but it is restricted to YouTube Red subscribers. In some areas, YouTube Red is included with a Google Play Music All Access subscription.


Not all videos are available for offline video, even with Red. It is up to the video creator to decide if offline viewing is allowed.
 It's recommended that you connect to a Wi-Fi network before downloading videos to watch offline. This will help prevent you from going over on data.
 You can save most, but not all, videos for later viewing without an internet connection.
 You'll find this to the right of the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons, on the right side of the screen. It looks like an arrow pointing down at a line. If you don't see this button, the video is not available for offline viewing, and you'll need to use another method from this article.
 You may be given several different quality options. Higher quality videos will look better, but will also take up more space on your device.
 When the button turns blue and displays a checkmark instead of a down arrow, the download is complete and the video is available for offline viewing.
 Tap the silhouette tab in the YouTube app to open your Account screen. You'll see the "Available offline" section appear when you have at least one video downloaded. Tap "Saved videos" to view the videos that you've downloaded., When you no longer want a video to be available offline, deleting it will free up space on your phone.


Tap the â‹® button next to the video you want to remove and select "Remove from saved videos." Tap "Remove" to confirm.

Gently brace your pet’s paw and brush its hair back in the direction opposite to how it grows. Using grooming scissors, trim overgrown hair., Gently hold your Rough Collie’s ear by the base with one hand and trim the excess hair growing from the top of it with the other hand. For a closer trim, gently pull hair away from the ear and trim as close as possible to its edge (a few millimeters away). Be very careful as the skin on the back of the ears is very thin and fragile., The hair on your Rough Collie’s back legs should be trimmed when overgrown for a more polished look. Have your dog lie on its side and hold its foot gently to brace the leg. Use grooming scissors to cut hair on its back leg into an arc shape., With your dog still lying on its side, grip its wrist gently but firmly between your thumb and index finger. With your free hand, cut hair growing underneath the paw until it is level with the pad of your dog’s foot. Trim all the way to the wrist.

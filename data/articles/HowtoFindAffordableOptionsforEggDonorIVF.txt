 A simple internet search for "Donor Egg IVF", "Donor Egg Bank" or "Shared Egg Donation" will populate millions of options.;
, In this method, either an anonymous or chosen egg donor are possibilities. You can then share this donor's eggs with another IVF patient or Egg Bank. Essentially, the results are in the title of the procedure: figure you will save around half overall- but remember, you will only receive a portion of the eggs retrieved. (The good news is, a young, healthy donor averages 16 eggs- and 8 certainly is enough!)

, Cryogenically frozen eggs are now gaining popularity. Although this is still considered a relatively new option, early data is showing pregnancy rates around 40%. Clinics all over have various options for clients. The most common is a "lot" of 5 frozen eggs for $18,500; however clinics are catching on quick and starting to offer "split/shared frozen eggs," too. Remember, it just takes one!

, This is the least likely to occur for essentially every patient, but occasionally, clinics offer a grant, or even one free cycle, to a lucky patient. Additionally, there are a handful of organizations that offer financial assistance for IVF treatments.
 Currently only 15 states have mandated coverage for fertility treatments, with varying limitations. One in six couples face infertility, and this does not include the most obvious in need of an egg donor, same sex couples. The squeaky wheel gets the grease- so start writing letters!

, Numerous countries around the world offer egg donation IVF cycles to foreign patients with in most cases huge cost savings. Again, an internet search can provide more information on country options, including Czech Republic, South Africa, Spain, Greece, Peoples Republic of Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Thailand, Guatemala, Mexico, Barbados, Panama, Brazil, Uganda, and India. The average cycle total ranges from USD $3,400 to $11,100, internationally - much cheaper than the US range.

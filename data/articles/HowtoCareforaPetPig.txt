Pigs are very social, so you need to be able to spend time interacting with the pig, and you need to be able to assert yourself as the leader or else you'll end up with a spoiled, pushy and possibly aggressive pig, which could be dangerous for children. Consider getting two pigs so that they can keep each other company, as well.Remember that pigs are very smart and curious. Once they learn how to do something (pull up the carpet, open the fence door, and so on) they won't forget, and you need to stay one step ahead of them. They can also be very sneaky, not unlike a toddler who'll try to manipulate you to get their way.It's important to keep them preoccupied and stimulated, or else they can be destructive when bored.Pigs should have an area outside where they can exercise their rooting instinct.
Consider the lifespan of a pig and the associated costs. Pigs can live up to 20 years, and they will need food, regular vaccinations, and hoof and tusk trims, in addition to being spayed or neutered. If you move, will you be able to bring the pig with you?

, Combine in a bowl the flour, the brown sugar, the chocolate chips, the cocoa powder, the baking soda, and the baking powder. Mix thoroughly with a spoon to combine the ingredients as much as possible before beginning the next step.
 Combine the vanilla, butter, egg, banana, and cr√®me fraiche to the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir it with a spoon, just enough to mix everything evenly.
 Put some batter into each of the muffin moulds using the spoon. Only fill them to about 2/3 of their capacity since the batter will rise while baking. Place the muffins onto a baking tray and put them into the oven. Allow to bake for about 25-30 minutes.
 Once the muffins are done, take them out of the oven and let them cool a little before removing them from the moulds. Place them on a serving tray.
 If you like, you can sprinkle the muffins with a little icing sugar. They taste best if you eat them while still warm. Enjoy!

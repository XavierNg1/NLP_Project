 Lay a sheet of wax paper or parchment paper across a baking sheet. You'll need about two to three sheets minimum.
 Melt over gentle heat.


Alternatively, you can melt the chocolate in a microwave. Use a microwave-safe bowl.
 Blow them to the size of the bowls you want. You could even vary the sizes if that suits your purposes.


Do not over blow the balloon.
 The bowl needs to be wide enough for you to dip the balloons into.
 Dip it to around one third or a quarter of the way up. Eyeball it to get the size of bowl you're after.
 Quickly dip the chocolate coated part of the balloon into the sprinkles. Lift and turn to cover all areas of the melted chocolate completely in sprinkles.
 Place the balloon into the refrigerator. Let it chill for five minutes.


You can also just set the balloon aside if the room is cool enough and let it set at room temperature.
, To complete the bowls, use the end of the scissors to poke a small hole into the balloon and let the air out slowly. For the part affixed to the chocolate, peel this away with care, to reveal the chocolate bowl.
 You could even add the chocolates made in Method 1! Or, fill it with scoops of your favorite ice cream.

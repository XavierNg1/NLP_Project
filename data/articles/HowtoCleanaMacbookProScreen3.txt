 Make sure that the Macbook Pro is turned off before proceeding. Detach the computer from its power adapter.


You should not proceed without detaching the computer. These components could get damaged if exposed to the wet cleanser. You could also get a slight shock if moisture reaches these electrical components as you work, especially if the power adapter is plugged in.
 Use a cleaner specifically sold for use with LCD screens.


Spray a small amount of this cleaner onto your soft cloth. Do not drench the cloth. It should only feel a little moist to the touch, and you should not be able to squeeze any liquid out of it.






Only use soft, lint-free, and static-free cloths. Lens cloths work especially well, but any microfiber cloth will usually do the trick. Avoid paper towels, dish towels, terry cloth towels, and other abrasive fabrics.






Only use cleaning products specifically created and sold for use with LCD screens.Do not use all-purpose cleaners, alcohol-based products, bleach, aerosol sprays, solvents, or abrasives. All of these products could seriously damage the screen. In extreme cases, the screen may even break completely.
Do not spray the cleaning solution directly on the screen. Doing so increases the likelihood of getting moisture into the openings at the bottom or along the sides. Moisture should not be allowed through these openings, since it can short out your computer if it gets inside.
 Pass the cloth over the Macbook Pro screen, working either from top to bottom or from side to side. Buff the screen in small circular motions, applying steady but light pressure.


Hold the computer screen near the very top or very bottom to reduce the risk of accidentally smudging it as you work.
Continue buffing the computer screen as necessary until all smudges are gone, reapplying cleaning solution as necessary. This may take several passes over the screen and several minutes to complete.

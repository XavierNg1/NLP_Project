 Make sure all faces have the right color, and then hold the cube with the RED side facing you and the GREEN side on top.;
, The front side is the RED side facing you.
 The left side is the YELLOW side with the BLUE vertical line.


The color of the center piece on each side indicates the color of that whole face.
 This step is exactly like step two.


At this point, you should have formed a 2 by 2 by 3 cube in the back right corner of the cube.
 The top side is the GREEN side, with the GREEN center piece.
 The right side is the WHITE side with the white center piece.


Make sure you're still holding the cube with the RED side facing you and the GREEN side on top.
 This motion is the opposite of that done in step 5.
 Make sure you move the front side twice in order to end up with a red, green, and white 2 by 2 by 2 cube in the right corner that's facing you.



At this point, you should have created the first cube, and you should have the two vertical green lines on the top and a red vertical line in the left column of the top face.
 Keep the cube in this position throughout Part 2.
 The left side is now the GREEN side because you are holding the cube differently.
 Remember to keep holding the cube with the orange side facing you and the yellow side on top as you perform each step.



You might feel like you are messing up the order, but it will all start coming together in the next few steps.
 The motion you perform for the right side is basically the opposite of what you do for the left side.
 Double check your work by comparing your cube's orientation with the one in the images.
 Make sure you perform this motion twice.


At this point, you could see that the 2 by 2 by 2 cube yellow, blue, and orange forming in the front right corner.
 You should now see two 2 by 2 by 2 cubes in two corners.

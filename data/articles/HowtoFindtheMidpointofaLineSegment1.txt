 The midpoint of a line segment is the point that is located on the exact midpoint of the two endpoints. Therefore, it's the average of the two endpoints, which is the average of the two x-coordinates and the two y-coordinates.;
, The midpoint formula can be used by adding the x-coordinates of the two endpoints and dividing the result by two and then adding the y-coordinates of the endpoints and dividing them by two. This is how you will find the average of the x and y coordinates of the endpoints.This is the formula: , You can't use the midpoint formula without knowing the x and y-coordinates of the endpoints. In this example, you want to find the midpoint, point O, which is between the two endpoints M (5,4) and N (3,-4). Therefore, (x1, y1) = (5, 4) and (x2, y2) = (3, -4).


Note that either pair of coordinates can serve as (x1, y1) or (x2, y2) -- since you'll just be adding the coordinates and dividing by two, it doesn't matter which pair is first.
 Now that you know the coordinates of the endpoints, you can plug them into the formula. Here's how you do it:


, Once you've plugged the appropriate coordinates into the formula, all you have to do is the simple arithmetic that will give you the midpoint of the two line segments. Here's how you do it:


=
=
(4, 0)
The midpoint of the endpoints (5,4) and (3, -4) is (4,0).

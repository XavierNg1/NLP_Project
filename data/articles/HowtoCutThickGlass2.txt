 A clean, successful break depends on precise measurements and accurate cut lines. Use a straight edge to designate where you want the glass to be cut. Use a grease pencil or sharpie to draw the lines on the glass where you want to cut it. The cut lines will be your guide for scoring.


You will use a glass scoring tool to “trace” over the cut lines.
Be sure to your cut lines start at one edge of the glass and end at the another., A glass cutter, also known as a scoring tool, does not break the glass. Instead, it scratches a line into the surface of the glass, weakening it. Once the glass is scored, you can then break it cleanly along the score line. When cutting thick glass, make sure you use a cutter that has a carbide wheel tip.


Steel-wheeled cutters tend to be flimsy in comparison and require lubrication.You can buy glass cutters at any hardware store.
 Grip the handle of the scoring tool firmly and vertically in your hand and place the wheel at the beginning of your first cut line. Line the straight edge up right next to the line for extra support. Using light pressure, run the tool along the line, right next to the straight edge. Make sure you apply equal pressure from the beginning to the end of each score line. Use one even, continuous motion.You will hear a clicking sound as the glass is scored.If you don’t hear it, press down a little harder.
 Place the scored glass on the edge of a hard surface, such as your work station, making sure that the scored edge of the glass is directly aligned with the edge of the counter. Push down quickly on the part of the glass which is hanging off the work station. It should snap off easily and cleanly in your hands. To make a clean break along curved score lines, its best to use a pair of running pliers.

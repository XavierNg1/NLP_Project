 Some types of gnats are attracted to the moist soil in house plants and even lay their eggs in it. There are several things you can do to get rid of the gnats and save your plant. Firstly, you should stop watering your plant until the top two inches of soil become completely dried out. This will cause the gnat eggs and larvae to dry out and die. Unfortunately, the plant may start to look a little sad, but it should quickly perk up once you start watering it again.
 Spray this liberally all over the plant -- on the leaves, the stem and the soil.


Leave the spray to sit on the plant for an hour or two, this should kill off the gnats. You may then want to spray the plant with plain water to rinse off the soap, to avoid causing damage to the plant.

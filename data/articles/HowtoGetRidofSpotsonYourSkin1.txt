 It's possible to do a lot more with lemon juice than make drinks. You can use it to sanitize a counter top, brighten white loads of laundry, and, believe it or not, you can even use it to treat freckles.

This treatment doesn't remove freckles but it does lighten your skin, and with it, your freckles. It's similar to the way people use it to highlight streaks of hair during the summer.



 


Take some fresh-squeezed lemon juice and apply it onto a cotton ball. After weeks of diligence, your freckles should start to fade.

, The lactic acids present in sour milk can help a lot to get rid of unwanted freckles. Take some sour cream, directly apply it on the affected skin area, and allow it to dry for 10 minutes. Instead of rinsing it off completely with water, you must gently wipe it off with a soft tissue or a towel. Lastly, apply some moisturizer.


Another option is to make a thick paste of powdered oatmeal and buttermilk. Apply this paste on the affected area, leave for about half an hour, and wash it off with cold water.
 If your freckles are seriously getting to you, home remedies may not do the trick. Laser surgery is an option, but it is permanent, expensive, and may not leave you with perfect results.


A pulsed-dye laser is the most common method used during this type of laser surgery. In this case, the laser actually emits pulses of a certain wavelength to the site of the freckles, targeting the blood vessels that lie just beneath the surface of the skin. Those blood vessels are then destroyed by the heat emitted from the laser, but the surrounding skin is basically untouched. The laser used for freckle removal is yellow in color, which is known for being safe for use on patients without producing any long-term skin-damaging effects.

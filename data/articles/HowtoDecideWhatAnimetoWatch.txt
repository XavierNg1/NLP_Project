 If you love romance, mystery, or something else entirely, you can find an anime about it! There are many different individual genres of anime, but it is also roughly grouped into four main sections by age and gender (not that you should ever let that should stop you if it sounds like something you'd like to watch!)

Shoujo - intended for girls up to the age of 18
Shounen - intended for boys up to the age of 18
Josei - intended for girls over the age of 18
Seinen - intended for boys over the age of 18;
, Once you've decided on a genre, see if you can find a list of recommendations. You probably won't have exactly the same taste as the person who made the list, but you can get some good ideas about which anime to try out.
 If you're a person who can't watch an anime if the drawings are really bad or not your style, then don't! Drawing styles vary depending on the author, genre and when it was drawn.
 They're well-known for a reason! You can start off with the famous ones like Naruto or Bleach.
 If you didn't really like it, at least watch the next episode to see if it picks up. Animes need second chances too!

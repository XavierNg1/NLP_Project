 You will need about 12 pieces of square paper. Origami paper will work great for this;
, Begin by folding a sheet of paper in half diagonally. Then, fold the triangle in half again to make an even smaller triangle.


Consider cutting little notches as well. This can make your garland more interesting. Do not make any cuts along any folded edges.
 Do this for the remaining triangles, so that you end up with six stapled triangle packets.
 Take two triangles and overlap the points by Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Staple the corners down.


You can staple through all of the paper layers.
If you don't want the staples to show, you can staple through just the inside layers, and leave the outermost layers unstapled.
 When you are done, you can pin the garland up on your wall using thumbtacks.

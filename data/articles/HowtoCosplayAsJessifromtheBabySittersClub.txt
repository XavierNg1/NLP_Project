  Jessi is of African-American descent.  Also, dye your hair black if it isn't already.;
,  Jessi wears her hair these ways when she is dancing.
  Since Jessi is a ballerina, she would wear these things routinely.  Another option would be to wear a suit and tie similar to what a guy would wear (but NEVER attempt to create a male bulge in this - keep in mind that Jessi is only eleven years old).  This option relates to book 75 in the series, where she acts in a play and plays a male teacher from the school.
  She does these a lot, even at Baby-sitters Club meetings.
  This is an imitation of what the script for the play in book 75 (see step 3) has Jessi do when playing the teacher.
,  This is Jessi's passion.
  This box should contain an eight-color Crayola crayon box, a pad of drawing paper, a number of masculine toys (but absolutely NO war-related toys), a Barbie doll, and a fake office kit (assemble using real office supplies, or order by mail or online).
  If the person who is sweating is male, use the word "perspire."  If the person who is sweating is female, use the word "glow."  This comes from book 55 in the series.
  In book 22 of the series, Jessi has to sit for a house full of pets.  If the pet is a dog, refer to it as Cheryl, Pooh Bear or Jacques.  If a cat, refer to it as Powder (if it is white), Ling-Ling, Tom, Crosby, or Rosie.  These are the names of the dogs and cats in book 22, in that house full of pets.
  Like Mallory, Jessi is strongly into horses.

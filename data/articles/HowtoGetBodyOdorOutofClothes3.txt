 Sweat stains and strange smells can actually come from using a certain type of antiperspirant. Experiment with different types of antiperspirant or just switch to deodorant.


Antiperspirants can sometimes trap molecules in the fabric of your shirt which leave those unsightly stains that don’t smell that great either., If you pour too much detergent in your laundry loads then the water is not able to completely dilute and wash it away. A sticky residue is left behind that traps odors into your clothing , rather than making them smell better.


If you feel like your clothes smell worse when you take them out of the wash, this might be the reason.
It may seem counter-intuitive to put less laundry detergent in when your clothes don’t smell good but give it a try.
 One way to prevent smelly clothes is to try to stay cleaner. Antibacterial soap can be very helpful in this regard. The next time you go to buy soap look for one that is labeled antibacterial – this type of soap will reduce the bacteria count on your body, thereby reducing the smell when you sweat.This is a good preventative measure that will also help your hygiene.
 Although antibacterial soap will do wonders for the bacteria on your body, showering once a day can accomplish the same feat. Try to save your shower until after you exercise so that you aren’t sleeping in your sweat. The more bacteria on the body, the worse you’ll smell, and then the worse your clothes will smell.


Make sure you dry off thoroughly after you get out of the shower. Bacteria does not breed as readily on dry skin.

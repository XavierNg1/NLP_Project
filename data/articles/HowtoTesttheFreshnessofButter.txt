 This should be the first indicator of the butter's freshness. Close to the use-by date or past it, and the butter is less likely to be fresh.;
, Butter should not be exposed to light during storage. This is why it is thoroughly wrapped and it is best if wrapped in foil. If it has been unwrapped, it risks turning rancid faster than even the suggested use by date.
 Look at the color. If the inside of the butter is the same as the outside, it is still fresh. However, if the inside of the butter is lighter than the outside of the butter, this means it has oxidized. As such, the butter is no longer fresh.
 Some people are better at using this method than others; if you use and consume butter a lot, it should be obvious when butter no longer smells fresh.


A small taste test can also tell you much; it will taste sour or bad if it is no longer fresh.

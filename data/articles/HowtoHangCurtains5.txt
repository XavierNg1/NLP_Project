 Roman shades can be placed within the frame of the window or can extend beyond depending on your preference. Where you mount your shades will determine the size of the shade you must buy.



Inside mount - Measure the distance between the edges of the inside window frames at the top, middle, and bottom and use the narrowest width. Then, measure the distance from the inside edge of the top window frame down to the top of the window to sill. If there is no sill, measure to the point where you want the shade to reach.

Outside mount - Measure the distance between the outermost points where the shade is to be placed. Be sure your measuring surface overlaps each side of window frame by at least 1 1/2" and as much as 3". Then, measure the distance from where top of shade will be located to top of sill or, if there's no sill, to the point where you want the shade to reach. Again, add 1 1/2" to 3" to this measurement.
 If you're mounting the shades inside the window frame, mount each bracket in the upper-most corners of the window frame. If you're using an outside mount, install the brackets to the wall above the window as per your measurements.


It's very important that your brackets are level so that the shade is even when you pull it up.
 Insert the front edge of the shade headrail onto the brackets and firmly press the back edge of the shades up into the mounting brackets until you hear them snap into place.

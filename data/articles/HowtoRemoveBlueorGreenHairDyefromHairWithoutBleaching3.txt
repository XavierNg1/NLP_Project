 Bath salts, which can be purchased at drug stores, grocery stores, or at big box stores like Walmart, are known to fade blue and green semi-permanent hair dye. Run a bath with hot water and add a package of bath salts. Soak your hair for as long as possible in the tub. When you are done, your hair dye should be faded. You should then shampoo and condition your hair. Repeat this process in a day or two if necessary.You can also stop up a sink and add bath salts to that if you donâ€™t want to soak in the tub.
 Note that this will really dry out your hair so it is important to condition your hair well after using this method. Add four or five drops of dish soap to a quarter-sized amount of shampoo. Get your hair wet using hot water and then lather your hair with the shampoo mixture. Leave this mixture in for 10 minutes, then rinse.Follow this with a conditioning treatment.
 You must make sure that the detergent you use does not contain bleach or any bleaching agents--these can be quite damaging to your hair. Get your hair wet with warm water and then work in one tablespoon of detergent. Add another tablespoon if you have particularly long hair. Rinse your hair thoroughly and then use a good conditioner to keep your hair healthy.

 Some mandolines have a container to catch the food as it is sliced, but if not, make sure you have a container under it. Set the mandoline on your cutting board, or on the counter or table, and be sure it will not slide around as you slice.
 Different models will have different options. If yours has multiple blades, then pick which is best for what you are cutting. If your mandoline has adjustable thickness, then set it to where you want it to cut.








If you don’t know exactly how the blades will cut, grab a potato and try out each blade so you can figure out when you’ll want to use which blade.
You can also test out the various thickness settings so you can see what works best for the dish you are planning to make.
Mandoline blades are incredibly sharp, so always handle carefully.
Besides thickness, the blades may also cut in a specific pattern or texture, which is important to know ahead of time. If you want matchsticks but you have a waffle cut blade, you’re not going to get what you want.
 Most mandolines won’t fit an entire cucumber, large potato, or whole onion. If the piece you are going to slice seems too big for the mandoline, cut it into smaller chunks that will fit better.
 The hand guard is not an optional piece of the mandoline, so don’t take it as such. Always secure the piece of food to it before you begin cutting. As you cut, pay attention to where your fingers are so they never get too close to the blade.








Even with the hand guard, it’s possible for your fingers to slip off it toward the blade, so always be careful and watchful of where your fingers are.
 Mandolines work best when you slice quickly, and their sharpness is designed for this. Don’t go so fast that you rock the mandoline back and forth, but you don’t need to go slowly.









Pay attention to where the slices fall to make sure they don’t stack up so high that they block the blade, which could cause you problems.
Keep your hand tight on the hand guard as you slice.

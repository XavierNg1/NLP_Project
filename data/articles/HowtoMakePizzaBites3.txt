 Take the large head of cauliflower and use a box grater to grate it into fine crumbs. Pour the crumbs into a large bowl. While you’re preparing the ingredients, preheat the oven to 400°F (204.5°C).Even if you’re not looking for a gluten-free recipe, this is still a tasty, healthier recipe than using pizza dough.
 Along with the cauliflower, add the 2 large eggs, shredded parmesan, basil, and garlic powder into the bowl. Season the ingredients with salt and pepper. Mix all of the ingredients together., Use your hands to form the ingredients into patties (as many as you can make). The patties should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter. The patties will be wet, but not so wet that the ingredients don’t bond together to from the patty., Put the patties on a greased baking sheet. They should be golden when they are done. Remove them from the oven and allow them to cool., Top each patty with a thin layer of marinara sauce. After that, add the shredded mozzarella. Put mini pepperonis on top of each patty., Once you have topped them with ingredients, put them back in the oven. Bake them for 5 to 7 minutes. When they are done baking, remove them from the oven and garnish each patty with basil.Cover the leftovers and store them in the refrigerator for no more than 3 to 5 days.

 Go to www.gmail.com and enter your username and password into the appropriate boxes. After you have entered your information, click the ‘Sign In’ button. If you are having problems logging in, click the ‘Need Help?’ button and follow Gmail’s instructions.
 After signing in to your Gmail account, you will immediately view all your inbox/sent mail listed in the center of the screen. In this list, find an email sent by or to the contact you want to remove from your list. If you do not see an email from that specific contact, there are two easy ways to find an email from that person:


Method One: Use the search bar at the top of your Gmail account. Type the contact’s information into the bar and press the button with the blue magnifying glass. All of the emails sent and received by this contact should then appear.
Method Two: Click on the 'Inbox', 'Sent mail', etc. filters placed on the left side of the screen in order to only view emails sent to you or emails that you sent out to others. This is particularly helpful if you know that you sent an email to this contact recently.
 After finding an email sent by or to the contact you wish to remove, hover your cursor over this specific email until you see a popup message showing the contact's picture, email address, and other pertinent information. On the bottom left corner of this box you will see a ‘Contact Info’ button. Click this button in order to access the form of the contact that you wish to remove from your digital address book.
 Once you have reached the contact information page for this specific person, click the ‘More’ button located in the top center of the page. A drop-down menu will appear--click the ‘Delete Contact’ button located at the top of this menu.

 Girls don't like it when guys act cool. Just relax and go with the flow.;
, Use deodorant and cologne, because girls really like it when guys smell nice. This will encourage girls to stay closer to you.
 You can start by saying Hey. Some girls are really shy and don't make it obvious that they like you, so you try starting up a conversation with her about who she is and what she likes to do. She'll come out of her shell. Other girls are outgoing and would appreciate the opportunity to talk to you, and may even talk to you first!

, Don't follow her around or act like a stalker, but casually notice where she goes, what she likes to do, and who her friends are.
 Becoming her friend will make her more comfortable around you. She will also grow to like you.
 If you are nervous, it's better to have a few things in the locker. Find out what she is interested in and have a few things prepared to tell her.
 Don't lie, explain how you really feel about her and try to hang out together.

 Start with dry hair. Begin by brushing your hair thoroughly with a paddle brush to remove any tangles you may have. Using a comb or pick, lightly tease your hair at the crown of your head. This will add some volume on top.








If you want additional volume, apply a volumizing powder or dry shampoo to the roots on the top of your head. Then fluff your hair gently with your fingers.;
, Brush all of your hair to the back of your head using the paddle brush. Grasp the hair where you would normally place a regular ponytail. Wrap a hair elastic around it once. Then, when you wrap the elastic around the second time, don’t pull your hair all the way through it. Stop about halfway through and let go of the elastic.








This will create a messy half-bun, with the remaining ponytail hanging loose right beneath it.
 Grasp the ponytail section and twist the hair around so that it is now directly above the bun rather than below it. Use both of your hands to gently pull on either side of the bun, which will flatten it out and loosen it up a bit.
 Place your index fingers on the hair directly above the bun. Pull your fingers in opposite directions, pulling your hair along with them. Pulling the hair apart will create an opening, which is where you will tuck the bun and the ponytail.
 Use your fingers to push the bun all the way into the opening you created. Then tuck the rest of the ponytail inside the opening. All of your hair and the hair elastic should now be tucked neatly into the opening and no longer visible.
 Secure the style with bobby pins if you need extra hold or plan to be out in humid weather. If you’d like to soften the look a bit, pull out a few strands of your hair around your face to frame it. You can use pomade to define these strands.

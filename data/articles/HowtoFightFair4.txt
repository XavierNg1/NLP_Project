 If the discussion is personal and you risk being misinterpreted, you should engage in the conversation face-to-face. A lot is lost online, which contributes to many mis-communications, including body language, voice inflection, and so on. Having an in-person conversation is more respectful to both you and the other person, and is likely worth the effort.
 When you read online content, you may be tempted to post a response immediately. In doing so, however, you risk making inflammatory statements that can be easily misunderstood. Take some time to cool off, go for a walk, and get a little perspective before responding. This will also give you time to construct a more sophisticated, intelligent response.
 Understand why you want to have conversations or disagreements with people online. Are you looking to start a productive dialogue? Do you want to just prove yourself ‘right’? Do you have an axe to grind? Being honest with yourself will help you understand why you want to argue with someone online.
 Determine the points that you can agree on before launching into fights about what you don’t agree on. This will enable a clearer route to resolution because you recognize that there is something positive to build upon.
 Mitigate the harsh tone in your writing by replacing phrases such as, “I think you’re stupid…,” with phrases such as, “I disagree with you for these reasons…” Your argument will be more structured and will carry more weight.
 Many arguments that happen online are inflamed because the attackers seem to forget that the other person is an actual person. Serious, personal, and violent insults and threats plague the internet and only serve to paint you as a horrible, mean person. Once you are a troll, you have stopped fighting fairly.
 In online forums, you are writing to the world. You should take the time to express yourself coherently so that you represent yourself and your opinions accurately.

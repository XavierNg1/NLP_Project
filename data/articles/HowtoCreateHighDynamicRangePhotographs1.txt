 HDR will often bring out the best in any scene, so this is up to you. If you're out of ideas, search Flickr to see what other people have done in HDR. Failing that, find a scene with plenty of cloud; HDR photos bring out a stunning amount of cloud detail.
 Put your camera on a tripod if you have one; find a solid surface to rest it on if you don't. If you have a remote release for your camera, all the better; you could also use a short self-timer if you don't. Whatever you use, it is very important that the camera does not move between shots. If your camera has automatic exposure bracketing, then use it (this is called AEB on the menus on Canon cameras). Setting AEB to -2/+2 EV is usually okay, but experiment to see what works best for you., If you have set up AEB on your camera, then just fire off three shots in a row. If you don't have AEB, then take a photo, adjust the shutter speed one or two stops faster (i.e. if you're at 1/250 sec, go to 1/500 or 1/1000 sec), take a photo, then adjust it one or two stops slower than your original shutter speed (i.e. if you were at 1/250 sec, then set it to 1/125 or 1/60 sec), and take another photo. You will now have three photographs: one overexposed, one underexposed, and one normal., You will now create and tone-map an HDR image from the three photographs you just took.

 One of the main treatments for acromegaly is surgery. During surgery, the doctors will remove the tumors located on your pituitary gland. The surgeon will go in through the nose to get to your pituitary gland.Eliminating the tumor helps to level out the production of growth hormones in your body. It also helps relieve symptoms by relieving any pressure on the surrounding tissue.
 If your doctor cannot remove all of the tumor, your body will still produce too much growth hormone. To help reduce or block your GH, your doctor will probably prescribe medication.Somatostatin analogues are one common type of medication prescribed. It helps reduce the amount of GH your pituitary gland produces. This medication is injected directly into your buttocks by a healthcare professional. You will have to do this once a month.
Dopamine agonists are another type of medication. These pills work to reduce the levels of GH and IGF-I in your body. This medication can cause compulsive behaviors, like gambling.
A growth hormone antagonist works to block the GH from interacting with your bodily tissues. This is taken as an injection that you give yourself.
 If you still have part of your tumor left after surgery, your doctor may suggest radiation. This helps to destroy any remaining tumorous cells. Radiation can also help reduce your GH levels.It may take years to see results from radiation treatments.

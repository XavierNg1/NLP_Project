 Choose sunflowers with brightly colored, undamaged petals. Use your fingers to pluck the petals off one at a time until you have as many petals as you want., Lay out two sheets of paper towel on a microwave-safe plate. Arrange the petals in a single layer on top of these paper towels, then place another two sheets of clean paper towel on top of the petals.

The paper towels will wick away the moisture released by the sunflower petals as you microwave them.
It is important that you keep the petals in a single layer. If you layer them together, there is some chance that they may end up sticking together or breaking apart when you try to separate them.
 Microwave the petals on high power for 20 to 40 seconds, or until the petals completely dry out.Check the sunflower petals after the first 20 seconds. If they still fill damp, continue microwaving them in 10 second intervals until they feel dry. Do not let the petals become crisp, though.
Dry the plates and switch out the paper towels in between batches. You could also let the paper towels sit out for a few minutes to let them dry instead of using new paper towels.
You should let the petals rest on your paper towels for several hours before you use them, for crafting purposes or otherwise. Doing so can help preserve them longer.

 This is why a huge effort has been made in the medical community to educate people about the importance of regular screenings for breast cancer, so that if any suspicious lumps are detected, their likelihood of being cured is as high as possible.
 If an abnormality is detected, further testing (such as an ultrasound, a biopsy of the abnormality, or possibly an MRI) will be performed to confirm whether or not it is breast cancer that needs to be treated.
 If you have it, it increases your chances of both breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The good news, however, is that if you test positive, you are aware of your heightened risk, and your doctor will offer you more screening tests than the average woman to optimize your chances of early detection and cure.


Women who are at high risk for getting breast cancer, like those with BRCA gene, will start getting mammograms earlier.
Some people who test positive for the gene also receive what is called a "prophylactic double mastectomy," meaning that they have their breasts removed before any cancer develops as a means of preventing it from occurring in the first place.
This is a matter of personal preference, as it does have a significant cosmetic impact.

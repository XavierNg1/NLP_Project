 If you need to, draw a cutting guide with a ruler and pen first. This will create a split in the bracelet so that you can pull it on and off.
 You can make these as narrow or as wide as you want to, but something between 1 and 2 inches (2.54 and 5.08 centimeters) would be ideal.
 If the bracelet doesn't fit right, punch holes into each end, then thread a short pipe cleaner through it. Hook the ends of the pipe cleaner over to keep it in place.
 If you need to, secure the end of the yarn to the bracelet with double-sided tape first. This will keep it from slipping.Wrap the yarn as closely as you can so that the cardboard doesn't show through.
Start wrapping the yarn on the inside of the bracelet.
If you added a pipe cleaner closer, be sure to cover up the hole and end so that no cardboard is showing.
 When you get to the other end of the bracelet, cut the yarn off, and glue it down. Secure the other end of the yarn at the start of the bracelet with glue as well.Try to finish wrapping the yarn on the inside of the bracelet.
 You can leave your bracelet as is, or you can add some designs into it. Cut off some yarn in a contrasting color, and thread it through a yarn needle. Weave the yarn through the yarn on your bracelet. You can do a simple up-and-down stitch, or you can make Xs.If you don't want to weave yarn, but still want some extra design, glue some pretty rhinestones or buttons onto the bracelet instead.

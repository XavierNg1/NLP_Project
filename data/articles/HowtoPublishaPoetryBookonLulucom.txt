 You can make it as long or as short as you'd like, but 100-150 pages of poems and lyrics is recommended.;
, There is no right or wrong way to design your book cover. However, some things to keep in mind include:


Know your message. If you aren't sure of the message you want to convey, you can bet that no one else will be, either.
Know the reader. Each book/compilation of works has a target audience, and your cover should appeal to this audience. If you attempt to appeal to everyone, chances are you'll end up appealing to no one.
Be smart in your layout. Size each element appropriatelyâ€”Make your most important elements visible; remember that larger elements will carry more weight than smaller ones.
Choose colors that play well off each other.
Place elements so that the viewer's eye will flow well. Things to think about: If you use slanting lines, make sure they all slant the same way, don't break up important sentences or phrases with different fonts, and avoid "trapped space."



, In MS Word (2007 and newer) you may choose between several types of headlines. "Headline 1" indicates that the headline is the start of a new chapter, for example. If you want to include titles that are categorized under a title of a chapter, mark that headline, and choose then "Headline 2". Repeat this when making a title which is categorized under the subtitle. And now, choose the fan "References" and choose "Content index". You want to choose to let the program create an automatic index.
 If the option cannot be found, download the "Save to PDF" - plugin from Microsoft Downloads., The payment will be put on a PayPal account which should be set up in your own name (you have to be 18 years old to be able to use all of the functions).

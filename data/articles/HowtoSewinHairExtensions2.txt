 Do not start all the way at the end if the person plans to wear her hair up or in a ponytail; otherwise, the extensions will show. Begin about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) in.
 Hold one in your right hand, one in your left and hold the center strand of hair in whatever hand feels comfortable.









Do not start with too much hair. Keep the strand sections small so that the finished braid isn't bulky and doesn't create a "bump" under the extensions.
If the cornrow is too thick, the hair could have trouble drying completely when you wash it and could become moldy.
 Then cross the hair in your left hand underneath the hair that's now in the center.









Repeat this criss-cross pattern along the part line of the hair. As you move, pick up additional hair from the head and add it to the center section so that you're creating one, continuous cornrow braid.

You can either add hair to the center section or to the left- and right-hand sections as you braid. Just be consistent.
Make your cornrow as tight as you can without causing pain.
 When you've reached the end of your part and you've used all the sectioned hair to create your cornrow, secure the end of the cornrow braid with a hair elastic or rubber band.









While braiding your hair, work towards the center of the head, beginning at the opposite side of the hairline and meeting in the middle. If you do this, the tail braid will fall down the center of the head instead of sticking out on one side.

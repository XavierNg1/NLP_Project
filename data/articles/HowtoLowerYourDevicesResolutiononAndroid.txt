 Go to your app drawer/app list, then look for the Google Play Store app. Tap it to open.;
, Tap the first one on the results list, which is made by Jack Palevich and MTM Developers, respectively.
 Download and install by tapping the “Install” button.
 Tap “Open” to launch the app or open from the app drawer. On the main app screen, you’ll see the pixels per inch as well as the screen resolution.


Take note of your device’s pixels per inch; we will be using this in the Terminal Emulator.
 Open the Android Terminal Emulator app. This is a console similar to the old Windows DOS console which runs commands input by the user.



First, type “su” on the command line, without the quotation marks. Press Enter.
Then type “wm_density_(pixels per inch of your specific device)”. The “_” resembles a space. Again, do not put quotation marks. Press Enter.
Then type “wm_size_(desired resolution)” Make sure to input a resolution that is lower, but still makes the display comprehensible.
 Reboot your device since some app icons and text won’t adjust in real time.


If you want to revert to your default resolution and pixel density, input these in the Terminal Emulator:

su
wm density reset
wm size reset


Done! make sure to research the best step down in terms of resolution for your device. Benchmarks for 3D and 2D performance should improve noticeably.

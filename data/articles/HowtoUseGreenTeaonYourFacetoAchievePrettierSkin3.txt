 To arrive to school or work with a glowing face, add green tea to your cleanser.
 Cut it open and empty its content into a small cup.
 A cream cleanser such as Noxzema or Clearasil will work best, since the creamy texture and green tea will bind together better. Spoon 2 tablespoons (29.6Â ml) (doesn't have to be exact) of the cleanser into the cup.
 It should look like thick white cream with lots of green flecks in it.
 Leave it on for 5 minutes, go make your bed to pass the time, then rinse it off.

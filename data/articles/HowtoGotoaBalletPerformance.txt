 The easiest way to do this, thanks to the wonders of the Internet, is to use Google. Usually, typing "ballet <your area>" will bring up a good enough selection. However, if you know of any theatres in your area that often run ballet performances, this may well be a better starting point.;
, If you have taken the website route, you can usually read a short outline of the ballet on there. It should give you some idea of what it is all about (and, most importantly, whether or not you want to see it)

, Usually, you will have to buy your tickets quite some way in advance so make sure you write down the time and date of the performance so you won't forget.
 Although you don't have to dress up extremely formal (like a black-tie event), wear a nice dress, or dress shirt and slacks. To dress nicely is to show respect for the performers and fellow audience members. Do not wear jeans and tennis shoes, or a frumpy t-shirt.
 It's rude to the dancers and to the rest of the audience to turn up late. Furthermore, some theatres may not let you in until the first intermission if you turn up after the ballet has begun.
 The cloak room is usually visible when you enter the theatre.
 Also, do not use flash photography, as this will be a disturbance for the audience members, and dangerous to the performers.

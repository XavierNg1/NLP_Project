 When you’re wearing a headband with your hair down, virtually any style will work. You can opt for a traditional horseshoe style headband made of plastic or metal or a stretchy fabric headband, and you can choose a thin headband for a delicate look or a wide headband for a bolder look.Embellished headbands, such as those with large bows or flowers attached, work very well when you’re wearing your hair down.  
You can find all headband styles in a variety of colors and patterns, so it’s easy to find an option that will match your outfit.;
, To ensure that your hair looks neat when you place the headband, you should brush it before hand. Brush your hair all the way down to the ends so it’s smooth and entirely free of tangles.








You may prefer to use a wide-tooth comb to brush through your hair because they don’t tug at your hair as much as a brush does.
If you aren’t happy with the natural texture of your hair, you can use a flat iron to straighten your locks or curling iron to add curls or waves after you brush it.  

, After you’ve removed any tangles from your hair, you can choose to add a part or not before you put the headband on. If you don’t want a part, just comb your back and away from your face. If you want a part, choose a side and carefully comb your hair over to that side.








Wearing a part with a headband typically looks best if you have bangs. After parting your hair, place the headband right where your bangs separate from the rest of your hair for the most flattering look.
 Once your hair is neatly combed and parted as you want, slide the headband into over your hair. Position it so it rests approximately ½ inch (1.27 cm) from your hairline, and adjust your hair as you like, such as pulling it over your ears or pushing it behind them.








If you have bangs, you can use the headband to push them back and hold them off your face or you can pull the bangs loose from the headband, depending on the look that you prefer.

 In addition, dry mouth itself can increase your risk of cavities and other oral health problems. Make sure to:


See your dentist regularly for check ups and cleanings.
Brush your teeth after each meal, and floss regularly.
Avoid sugary food and drinks.
 Over-the-counter (OTC) mouthwashes can help kill bacteria and fight plaque build-up. Use one at least twice a day, but make sure that it is alcohol-free, since alcohol-based formulas may worsen dry mouth.Your dentist may also recommend a prescription-strength fluoride rinse to protect your teeth, and/or a rinse that is specifically meant to treat dry mouth.
 Chewing or sucking on certain substances can promote saliva production and soothe dry mouth. Sugar-free gums, candies, mints, etc. can help in this way without increasing your chance of developing cavities or other oral health problems.Xylitol, which is often found in sugar-free gums and candies, can cause diarrhea or cramps is consumed in large quantities.
 These are available at most pharmacies. Look for one that contains xylitol, carboxymethylcellulose, or hydroxyethyl cellulose.
 Sometimes, dry mouth can simply be caused by a dry environment. Many modern homes are very dry, but a cool mist humidifier can replace some moisture into the air and alleviate your symptoms.You can find cool mist humidifiers at most pharmacies and many department stores.
You can use a humidifier any time, but it can be particularly helpful if you use it in your bedroom at night.
 Sometimes this is habitual, so make a concerted effort to breathe through your nose.


If you cannot breathe through your nose, ask your doctor about nasal decongestion or other techniques that can help.
 Regularly applying lip balm, however, will protect your lips.
 Every time you take a drag on your cigarette, you pull more hot smoke into your mouth. The tar from the cigarette can also irritate or clog your salivary glands.

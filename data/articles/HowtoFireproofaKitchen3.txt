To mitigate the risk of a fire starting under your range hood, you should clean it regularly., Small appliances like toasters and microwaves are often the start of kitchen fires. Crumbs gather at the bottom of your toaster. If the toaster is left on for too long or is defective, the crumbs could catch fire. To mitigate this risk, you should regularly clean these appliances., If you let grease and grime build up on your kitchen stove and then start cooking, you are increasing the risk of a fire.

 Staying in the hospital wreaks havoc on their normal routine. By bringing some creature comforts from home, you might help your child adjust to hospitalization. Give them some control in what you bring by asking, “What toys do you want?” Or, “What pajamas would you like me to pack?”


Watch favorite TV shows, read books at bedtime, or bring along a favorite stuffed animal to help them sleep., If you typically don’t let your child stay up past midnight watching TV, don’t allow this at the hospital. You may be tempted to indulge a sick child, but you’ll have to break these habits all over again upon their discharge. Setting limits helps the child get the same sense of structure they get at home.Also, maintaining consistency with parenting helps your child feel at ease. Failing to parent as usual may send the message that the problem is bigger than you’re letting on.
 Your presence during this process is important to your child’s sense of security. Try to be there for them as much as you can. Staying overnight is also recommended, especially if your child is quite young.Spend time together like you normally would. Talk to them about the pictures they draw or books they read.
 If your child is in a hospital unit that allows younger visitors, consider letting their siblings come for a visit. Just seeing one another for a short period of time may help your child and their siblings relax about the hospitalization. Visits from friendly faces also help your child stay connected to the outside world.

 As they age, some cats begin to put on weight because they are eating the same amount of calories but they are doing less physical activity. If this is the case for your cat, cut down on the amount of food you are giving it.


In general, a cat should eat about 50 calories per kilogram of weight every day. This should be adjusted to take your cat's specific health and activity level into consideration.You should gradually cut down the cat's food so that it doesn't notice the change.
 If your cat is in good health but needs to use more energy during the day, consider putting its food in a location where it has to expend some energy to get to it. This could be beyond a baby gate it has to jump over or place the food on a counter so it has to jump up to get it. Food can be a good motivation for some cats to get a little bit of exercise.


This should only be done for cats that are in good health and can still jump easily. If your cat has mobility issues, don't make getting to its food more difficult.
 If your cat has health issues that have limited its mobility or caused weight gain, these should be treated by a veterinarian but you can help with what you feed your cat. There are some cat foods that are made specifically for cats with health issues that impact weight, such as diabetes or colitis. Foods for these conditions tend to have higher rates of dietary fiber and digestible nutrients.Discuss your cat's weight, what you are feeding it, and how much you are feeding it with your veterinarian. They may have some suggestions for how to change your cat's diet to improve its health.

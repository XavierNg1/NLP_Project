 Use a bowl that can handle and wash off dyes. Before coloring your frosting, try chilling it in the fridge to help the color stay vibrant. Also, make sure the frosting is light in color; if it's dark like chocolate frosting you won't see the color really well.;
, Drop about 2-3 drops of food coloring gel into the frosting. Feel free to add more drops to make a deeper shade. This will not be needed for food gel, however, since food gel is more vibrant makes the color much brighter.
 Use a spoon and stir the frosting and dye together. The color of the food dye you added should start to appear. If you want to make it darker, use more gel or food coloring. Thoroughly stir the dye so the color mixes in evenly. You may use a blender, especially if you are making homemade frosting.
 Use your food coloring for cupcakes, cakes, brownies, cookies, and more. The color of your frosting can match with themes, parties, celebrations, and holidays. Be creative! Store the frosting for later use by wrapping with plastic wrap and leaving in the fridge.

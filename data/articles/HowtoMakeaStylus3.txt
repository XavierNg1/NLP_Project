 You'll need about a foot of aluminum foil, tape of any kind, and an unsharpened pencil. You may also need a sharp knife to whittle your pencil.If you don't have a pencil, you can substitute a pen, a chopstick, a dowel--anything pen-shaped. Pencils or other wooden objects work best, however, as you may want to cut your stylus to have an angled tip.
 The angled tip should still have a surface area of at least four millimeters, about the size of a pencil eraser or the very tip of your finger. Many capacitive touch screens will not register the touch of anything smaller.The stylus will work without this step, but you will have to hold it straight up and down. This will make it more comfortable to hold.
Always be careful when handling a knife--remember to cut away from your body. Never pull the knife toward yourself.
 Fold the aluminum foil neatly over the tips.









If you are using a pen, keep the cap on the pen when you wrap it., It should be smooth and flat on the tip. You don't want any crinkles or bumps.








If your tip is not flat, your stylus may not work.
 This will keep the foil in place.
 This will protect you screen from getting scratched by the aluminum foil.
 If it isn't working, try to flatten your tip even more. Remember that you want the tip to be at least the size of an eraser or else it may not be acknowledged by your touch screen.

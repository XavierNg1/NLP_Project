 From the Apple menu, scroll to System Preferences and click.;
, Go to the third row down entitled "Internet & Wireless". To the right of the Bluetooth icon you should see a little blue folder with a yellow sign on it with the word "Sharing" under it. Click that.
 At the top of the window that popped up, you will see Computer Name: followed by an entry field with the current name.
 You can change that to whatever you desire by deleting that name, and naming it however you wish.

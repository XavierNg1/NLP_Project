 You may want to comment to show your appreciation, or ask questions. The autistic community is an autistic place, but friendly visitors are always welcome.


It is okay to share articles or reblog things you found in the #actuallyautistic tag. (You may wish to mention that you aren't autistic, though, so people don't get confused.)
It's okay to say that an article helped you, or that you agree.
It's okay to ask questions. However, autistic people are not search engines, so they are not obligated to provide an answer.
Remember, there are plenty of allies who participate in discussions and write autism-related posts!

, While plenty of autistic people are happy to help, some questions ("Do autistic people have bellybuttons too?") seem a little obvious or demeaning. If you have a question, search the internet for a few minutes first, because the answer might be readily available.
 Like all subcultures, the autistic community has some unwritten etiquette guidelines. Here some insider tips regarding things to avoid:


Posting in the #actuallyautistic tag (It was developed specifically for autistic people to discuss things.Neurotypicals can post in the #autism tag.)
Speaking of autism as a scourge to be eliminated
Taking venting personally (When someone says "I hate when NTs talk over me!" they are not talking specifically about you, and it's rude to interject "Not all NTs!")
Pretending to understand autistic people's minds better than they do

, Allies are welcome, and autistic people can always use a hand in organizing events, finding resources, or simply educating the community. If you see autistic people organizing something, feel free to ask "Can I help?" or "May I join you?"

, Some autistic writers have articles written specifically for how you can help your loved ones and be a great ally. Never be afraid to ask for tips!

 Follow your state's regulations for forming and organizing a corporation.After you file the initial documents to form your corporation or LLC, you must have an initial organizational meeting with your owners or directors in which you adopt the company's bylaws, issue stock, and elect officers.When you issue stock, prepare stock certificates and keep a record of the shares issued that you update as necessary.All states require corporations and LLCs to file certain documents, among them an annual statement. This document ensures the state has accurate records of the corporations and LLCs that operate within its borders.If you fail to file the required paperwork and pay the associated fees to the state each year, your corporation or LLC may be administratively dissolved, leaving you susceptible to personal liability.Keep in mind that you must follow the filing requirements of the state in which you were incorporated, not just the ones of the state where you are located.For example, if your business is incorporated in Delaware you must follow Delaware's filing and reporting requirements. If you've registered in another state as a foreign corporation, you also must follow any filing and reporting requirements for that state.Although states typically require fewer formalities for LLCs than for corporations, the same basic concepts apply. The company is treated as an entity separate and apart from you only if you establish it as separate from you and your personal finances.;
, Your board meetings should follow state formalities and have recorded minutes.


Your state's law dictates the minimum number of meetings required by shareholders and directors for a corporation organized in that state.While states typically don't require meetings for LLCs, having them anyway provides proof that your LLC is a legitimate business enterprise distinct from you and can help you avoid personal liability.
While state requirements differ, you should plan on having a formal meeting of the directors and shareholders at least once a year.Have your meeting at a similar time each year and provide adequate notice to everyone required to attend.
 If you've formed a corporation, most states require you to file your bylaws with the secretary of state.


The bylaws outline the way your company is organized and how it will operate.Along with your bylaws, you might also consider creating a written code of ethics by which your company's owners operate.Make sure everyone on your board knows, understands, and abides by your corporate bylaws.If you've formed an LLC rather than a corporation, you still may be responsible for creating an operating agreement. This document serves a similar function to the corporation's bylaws. It typically is in your best interest to create one even if your state doesn't require you to file it with the secretary of state., In addition to the meetings of board meetings, all corporate transactions should be documented and accounted for meticulously.Even if you are in a closely held family business, you still should document meetings and corporate transactions. For example, if you and your spouse have created a corporation to run your bakery, all you need to do to observe the proper corporate formalities is meet together and agree on basic business decisions, then write down what you did.Check your state's law to determine what functions can be carried out independently by officers and which require shareholder approval. Even if as a matter of practice you and your partners are the only directors and shareholders, the decisions you make on a daily basis should be documented and in compliance with your state's law.Any contracts, including purchases or leases of real property, employment, service, and other business agreements, should be kept together with your other corporate records., Include the corporate name on all business documents and ensure that all individuals indicate their role when signing any documents.Use the appropriate official designation such as "Inc." or "LLC" after the name of your company on all official company documents such as letterhead, business cards, and advertisements.When individuals sign financial statements, checks, or other documents on behalf of the company, they should include the company's name and the title they hold that gives them the capacity to sign on behalf of the company.For example, if Kelly Kincaid is CEO of her baking company, Kelly's Kupcakes, she would sign any documents as "Kelly Kincaid, CEO, Kelly's Kupcakes."

, Although typically not required by state law, insurance can protect against under-capitalization and shield directors from personal liability for actions they took on behalf of the corporation.General liability insurance can be used to protect your corporation or LLC from personal injury lawsuits, such as if a customer slips and falls on company property.If you have sufficient insurance to cover potential negligence or other tort liability, you typically can get away with smaller initial investments to capitalize the business.Errors and Omissions insurance also helps you avoid personal liability, by shielding corporate officers and directors from liability for actions they undertake on behalf of the business., Particularly in family businesses, an independent director can add separation and legitimacy to the corporate form.


Even if you're a relatively small corporation, following the federal requirements for public companies can help ensure you defeat an attempt to pierce the corporate veil and make you personally liable.Since family businesses may be more susceptible to personal liability, an independent director provides proof that you are treating your business as separate and distinct from your own personal finances.Keep in mind that one of the most common factors courts consider when deciding whether to pierce the corporate veil is whether one person or a small family group are in complete control of the corporation or LLC., Hire a business attorney to represent the corporation separately from your personal legal interests.Your business attorney also can provide you with various forms for your corporate documentation that comply with your state's requirements.Particularly if the corporation is sued and you are named personally, you should seek an experienced business litigation attorney in your area to defend you., If your corporation doesn't start with enough money to cover basic expenses, you risk personal liability.


The amount of money needed varies widely among businesses, but all businesses will have basic start-up expenses for necessary equipment and other items. If you provide this money yourself, make sure it is allocated to the business and expenses are paid through business accounts, rather than your own personal accounts.It's not necessary for your company to have significant money in the bank, but courts will look at a company that never was capable of standing on its own two feet as one that was never actually intended to be separate from its owners., The amount of your initial investment should take into account the expenses of your particular business.If your corporation ends up being sued by a creditor and doesn't have sufficient assets to collect, the creditor may be able to pierce the corporate veil on a theory of unjust costs. You can open yourself up to this risk by failing to adequately capitalize your corporation or LLC.Likewise, if your company never had enough funds to operate on its own, a court probably will quickly determine that it was never intended to be a separate entity from you personally, again opening you up to personal liability., Typically you want to classify funds provided by individual owners to pay corporate expenses as loans.


If it becomes necessary for you or another owner to contribute additional funds to the business, for example to meet your payroll, draw up a contract identifying the money as a loan from the owner to the corporation.You also can treat an additional infusion of capital as a purchase of additional stock in the company â€“ provided you have additional stock available. If doing so changes the percentages of equity each shareholder has in the business, it may be subject to approval from the others.If money deposited by an owner is not treated as an equity capital investment, issue a promissory note from the company to the owner and pay the money back from the corporate coffers as agreed., You risk personal liability for business transactions if you assume responsibility for repayment of debts.Even if the court doesn't ignore the corporation entirely, if you have guaranteed a loan personally that creditor typically will be able to come after your assets if the corporation defaults on the loan.
 The corporate accounts should be separate and unlinked to your personal bank accounts.You may find it easier to keep corporate and personal funds separate if you open the corporation's accounts at a different bank than the one you use for your personal finances.
If you don't maintain a strict separation between your business and personal finances, a court may determine that your company is a sham and you are operating the business personally. Like a sole proprietor, you become liable for the debts of the business., Don't pay for personal items using your corporation's account or credit cards.Keep accurate records of your business expenses and make sure you can justify each transaction with a business purpose.
If you have doubts about the business purpose of a transaction, use a personal credit card to pay for it and then seek reimbursement for the purchase from the company. Keep in mind that some business expenses aren't entirely tax-deductible.If your company is sued and it turns out you've been paying personal bills from your business account, the court may hold you personally liable.By the same token, don't deposit checks written to the corporation in your personal bank account. If the corporation owes you money, have a check written from the corporate account to cover that amount rather than diverting a payment intended for the business., Avoid using your personal property for business purposes, or using business property for personal purposes.


A judge will be more likely to pierce the corporate veil and hold you personally liable if he or she has trouble determining which assets are yours and which belong to the company.If your business operates out of land owned or leased by one of the owners, have appropriate documentation in place and draw up a lease agreement between the landowner and the business. Have the business pay rent to the landowner according to the agreement., If an owner removes money from a corporate account, it should be classified as repayment of a previous loan, payment for services, or as a loan from the corporation to the owner.


Money taken by owners should be documented the same way you document deposits from owners. If the money is salary, bonus, or other pay, it should be paid to that owner the same way any other employee would be paid â€“ not withdrawn directly from the corporation's bank account by the owner.If the corporation owes the owner money, the amount should be documented as such and paid back to the owner pursuant to an existing promissory note or loan agreement.If you or another owner is borrowing money from the corporation, draw up a loan agreement with a payment schedule, and charge reasonable interest on the amount.

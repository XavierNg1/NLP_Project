 Maine offers a pre-apprenticeship program for students in 11th and 12th grade. The program requires students to log 1,000 hours of on-the-job electrician training by working part-time during the school year, and part-time or full-time during the summer. Upon completion of the pre-apprenticeship program, graduates may enter an electrician apprenticeship program. Pre-apprenticeship hours count towards the hours required for the electrician apprenticeship in Maine.;
, Aspiring electricians must graduate high school or earn a General Equivalency Diploma (G.E.D.). High school students interested in electrician careers should have an aptitude for math and take several math classes, including algebra and geometry.
 A college degree is not required to become an electrician in Maine. Some electricians choose to earn an associate's degree or bachelor's degree prior to entering an apprenticeship. Often, electricians with college degrees earn higher salaries than those without degrees.

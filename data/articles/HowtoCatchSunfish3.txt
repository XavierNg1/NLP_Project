 Sunfish don’t like to chase their food. Try placing the bait on a hook under a cork. Make sure the float is small because if the cork is too large and heavy, the sunfish will detect it and avoid the bait. Keep the line still because they like motionless bait.Put one to three feet between the cork and the hook. Try different depths if you are having trouble catching anything.
 Your line doesn’t have to have a cork if the bottom of the body of water doesn’t have a lot of cover. You can let the hook sink to the bottom of a gravel or sandy bottom, especially when you are bed fishing in early spring or after a cold snap.After a few minutes, recast the line.
Make sure that you use light weight so the bait can fall to the bottom slowly.
 Another way to catch sunfish, especially in late summer when they are more readily found in open water, is to drift the bait through the water with a boat. The hook should be suspended around 10 to 15 feet down into the water. Drift across the lake, dragging the bait through the water.You may want to try drifting in areas where you know fish have been before.
 If the line doesn’t tug or the bobber move by then, reel in about a foot and repeat the process. Try a different bait and cast again. Then, cast in a different place.


If there are no bites where you cast and you use the right bait, then there may not be any hungry fish in the area.
 When the sunfish bites, you will see ripples and the cork might go under then up over the water with a loud plop. Don’t move your rod. This is difficult and infuriating, but the fish is probably just nibbling and smelling the bait.When they bite, the bobber will go under and to the side. Jerk your rod up lightly in the opposite direction of the bobber to set the hook. If the bobber moves to one side but not down, then the sunfish hasn’t bitten the hook.

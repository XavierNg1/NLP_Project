 Try different forms of meditation, like mindfulness, to find the style that fits best with your lifestyle and motivates you to meditate.


Focus on the here and now when you try mindfulness meditation. Meditate on your breath and how you feel emotionally and physically.For example, think about each part of your body and how it feels. Does anything feel tense? Do any parts of your body feel relaxed?
Don’t try to push away or suppress anything you are feeling. Simply acknowledge it and notice the details of the feeling.
For example, you might think, “I feel impatient. It’s making my body a bit tense.”

, This form of meditation is usually used before or after performing yoga poses.Some yogis meditate while holding a yoga pose. The physical movement involved before or after meditating just might give you the motivation you need.


After or before your yoga session, try meditating for a few minutes.
Find a comfortable yoga pose and meditate while you hold the pose. For example, you may want to meditate while you are in child pose.
 Also called Zazen, Zen meditation has its base in Buddhism and focuses on concentration.In this practice you concentrate on your breathing and meditate on a specific question or idea. You may find that having something specific to meditate about will motivate you to meditate.


Start by sitting and concentrating on your breathing.
Once you have learned to focus on your breathing, you can begin to concentrate on counting. Simply thinking about the numbers.
Eventually, you can move to meditating on a particular koan, or question.
 It can also be a source of motivation knowing that friends or classmates are going to be present.


Even if you prefer solitary meditation, you may be motivated by discussing meditation with a supportive friend.
You can use this as an opportunity to exchange insights and questions with each other.

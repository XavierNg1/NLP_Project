 Find a fabric that you love that will also be comfortable to wear and easy to sew. Before buying elastic, measure around your waist where you want your skirt to sit. This is how long your piece of elastic should be. You will also need a measuring tape and washable marker, a pair of sharp scissors, a needle, thread, and pins.;
, You can buy a simple skirt pattern either online or at a fabric/craft store. It might be easier to buy one at a store, because online patterns are often too large to print on a normal printer.


Many patterns also come with suggestions for the types of fabric and thread that would work for the project, so it’s a good idea to buy the pattern and check those out first before buying your other materials.
 Lay your printed pattern over your fabric and pin the two together. Then cut carefully around the edge of the pattern. Depending on the pattern you buy, you will likely have two matching pieces when you’re done: one for the front of the skirt and one for the back.
 Sew the front and back pieces together on the right and left edges. Make sure the “right” side of each piece (the side of the fabric you want showing on your skirt) is facing in, against the other. Sew evenly along the edges with a simple stitch.









This is a good point to carefully try on the skirt (you can keep it inside out). If it needs to be smaller at any point, take it in by stitching parallel to the inside of your previous line of stitching.
 Fold over a half inch of the fabric at the bottom of the skirt and sew the hem using a hemming stitch.
 If you buy a pattern with an elastic waist or room for a zipper, you will need to sew that next. Place your piece of elastic at the inside top edge of your skirt and stitch the two ends of the elastic together. Then fold that top edge of the fabric down, so that the elastic is encased in fabric. Sew this “casing” around the elastic by stitching the fold to the main skirt, much as you did with the hem.

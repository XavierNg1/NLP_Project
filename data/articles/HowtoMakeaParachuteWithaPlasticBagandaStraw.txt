Only cut down to the concertina flex part of the straw and not beyond.




;
, Seal this end together using a flame:

Hold the end in place with the pliers.





With care, use the naked flame to heat seal together.


Bend over the end, with the double-sided tape intact.


Cut off the handles and the base, as shown in the image.





Cut out a rough square shape as shown in the image. The square should measure about 35 centimeter (13.8 in) x 35 centimeter (13.8 in) / 13.7" x 13.7".





Fold like origami. Fold in half, then a quarter, then an eighth, and then a sixteenth (1/2>1/4>1/8>1/16).





Once folded, cut the folded piece a length of 15 centimeter (5.9 in) / 5.9" radius. Cut off this excess, so it'll form an isosceles triangle.





Unfold the circle. You'll see that the fold lines remain clearly, indicating suitable positioning of the parachute strings to ensure even balance.
 Stick the sticky side alongside one fold line.

Continue working your way around the entire parachute using even positioning, as shown in the image. It's helpful to click and enlarge this image to follow it more easily.





The appearance at this stage.
 Where the cut lengths of the parachute meet the concertina flex of the straw, there remains an open hole. In order to weight the parachute for smooth floating, you'll need to fill this with some small beads.

Carefully funnel the small beads into the hole.





Seal the beads in by corking it with tissue pieces. Make sure it is firm so that the beads don't come tumbling out.
 While this step isn't necessary, it's also fun and it personalizes the parachute. A great activity for kids during the holidays or on rainy weekends!
, Throw it into the air on an angle. It should go up like an umbrella. Release and watch it drop.

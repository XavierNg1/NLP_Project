 Yes, chia seeds are what you used to find in the chia pet your aunt bought you for Christmas. However, you don't want to eat those seeds. Instead, you'll find good, organic chia seeds at most health food stores.Chia seeds make a great addition to a sports drink because they are a complete protein, plus they contain both antioxidants and potassium. They also contain good fats (omega-3 fatty acids) and calcium.
 Warming the water helps chia seeds release their magic. It doesn't have to be boiling. Just heating up a cup (0.24 liters) of water in the microwave for a minute or so should do it. Add the chia seeds, and stir it up. Your seeds should start to get bigger. When they do, put a lid on the container, and leave it in the fridge to soak overnight., When you take your mixture out the next morning, it should be thick. Chia seeds form a gel-like substance in water. To make it drinkable, add your juice to it. You can use any kind of organic, 100% juice you want. Stir it in until it is well incorporated. You can split this drink into two servings.

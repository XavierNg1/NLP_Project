 From crowns and traditional party hats to wigs or bows, choose the hat that best describes the party scene.


Take into consideration the balloon size when selecting the hat.
 White glue will work but look into glue that works well with either latex or Mylar material.
 This method will work with balloons you blow up yourself or helium balloons.
 Use enough glue so that the hat stays in place. This may mean adding a little clear tape to hold it steady as well.

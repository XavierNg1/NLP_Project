 When you begin, pull out every item of clothing that your child will take to daycare, including gloves, boots, and coats in the winter, and sunglasses, swimsuits, and shorts in the summertime.;
, This will help keep track of what has been done. As your child grows and more clothing is purchased, label each item as it joins the closet.
 Check to make sure everything is labeled before you drop him off each day. A good place for labels are along the back of the clothing, such as the rear tag or seam, where it is out of reach from the child.


Periodically check the clothes after they come out of the laundry to make sure they are still labeled.
 You can either label the clothes with your child’s first name and last initial or just his initials. If you use initials or just your child’s first name, check with the daycare to make sure there aren’t other children with the same name or the same initials.


If you plan to pass the clothing down and use it on future children, label it simply with your last name.

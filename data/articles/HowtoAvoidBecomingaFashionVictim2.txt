 The fashion industry is designed to routinely make you feel out of style. They’re in the business of selling clothing and the best way to do that is to constantly change what is trendy.An easy way to fall victim to fashion is to hold onto a look that fell out of style long ago. If your favorite trend is a decade old, and has yet to come back into style (like high waisted pants) it’s time to update your look to something more current.
 A good rule of thumb is to retire an old trend whenever you pick up a new one. This prevents unnecessary crowding of your closet and lets you focus on the current trends. It’s also a good idea to rid your closet of items you haven’t worn in the last 6 months.


A fast way to gauge unworn clothing is to hang everything “backwards” on the hanger at the start of a season. When you wear and wash something, put it back in your closet facing the opposite direction. At the end of the season, everything that is still hanging backwards needs to go., Throw out anything stained, stretched out, damaged or ill-fitting. Wearing anything along these lines will make you an instant fashion victim. Sometimes we hold onto clothes for sentimental value, even though they’re 2 sizes too small and we should never be seen in them again!, Hand-me-downs are a great way to change your wardrobe on a budget, but if a hand-me-down is too worn, the wrong size, ugly, or out of style, do not add it to your wardrobe. Accepting them is an easy way to clutter your closet again.

 There are three main types of panels: twisted nematic (TN), vertical alignment (VA), and in-plane switching or plane-line switching (IPS/PLS). All three use LCD technology and generally, the quality and expensiveness for these options increase in this order.IPS/PLS is an especially good choice for photographers and graphic designers, because their color accuracy and angle viewing capabilities are top notch.
One weakness of the IPS/PLS panel is that its refresh rates are a bit slower, which can be an issue for frequent gamers.;
, Typically, the bigger the display, the higher the resolution. Resolution is the number of picture elements, or pixels, that make up each image that you view on your monitor. More pixels means more detail, and more detail is needed if you’re viewing on a greater surface.


Typical resolutions range from 1,440x900 to 2,560x2,440 and even higher, often depending on the monitor’s screen size., Refresh rate is the number of times a second that the monitor can update the image. Response time measures how fast the monitor can update from one frame to the next. These determine how blurry and choppy or clear and smooth videos appear on your monitor.

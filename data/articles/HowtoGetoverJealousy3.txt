 If you think you are justified in your jealousy, talk to your partner as soon as possible. Be honest, but stay pleasant and level-headed. Explain exactly how you feel, and how you reached that conclusion. The instructions below cover a few possible next steps.


Be careful not to accuse your partner. Don’t raise your voice or look annoyed. This can be a tricky conversation if your partner doesn’t want to hear it.
 If another person is flirting with your partner, the two of you can confront him or her together. Firmly but politely ask this person to stop.
 If your partner’s behavior is bothering you, set clear boundaries for appropriate behavior. This will avoid future confusion as to whether your partner is overstepping bounds.
 If your partner does not agree that your jealousy is justified, take some time to think it over. Examine the cause and your thoughts just as you did before. This time, take into account any new information or perspective your partner provided.


An angry response doesn't necessarily mean your partner has something to hide. Your partner could be offended at your lack of trust (whether justified or not).
 Contact an unbiased third party. Ask him to provide insight or mediate between you. He might have a clearer perspective on the matter, and can provide feedback on whose behavior is justified.


Pick a friend or couple that both of you know with similar familiarity. Don’t contact your relative or a close friend who knows you but not your partner.
 If you and your partner still can't agree, consider whether the relationship should continue or not. Unwillingness to compromise can be disastrous in a relationship.

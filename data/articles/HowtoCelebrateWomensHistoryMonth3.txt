 Look for books catered to your child's age range. Have your child read books about women and women's history throughout March. You can also read to your child if they're too young to read.Try books like Rad American Women A to Z by Kate Schatz and the Little Big Dream Series. Each book in this series focuses on the life of a different historic female.
If you need inspiration, stop by your local library and ask a librarian for recommendations.
 This can be a fun project to help your child learn about women's history. Have them find a woman in their community who they admire. This can be a teacher, a friend's parent, or someone they know from a club. Your child can also choose a family member, such as their grandmother. Have your child interview that woman and then report what they learn.You can have your child come up with their own questions. You can also print out interview sheets online. TIME for kids has an interview sheet you can print out for free.
 Find an organization in your area that supports women, such as women's health clinic or women's shelter. Talk to your child about the organization and what they do. You can encourage to donate a portion of their allowance to the shelter.You can find local organizations that are related to children. For example, maybe there is a local daycare center that caters to low-income women. You could encourage your child to donate the money there.
 Have your child choose a woman they admire. It can be a famous woman, a family member, or a friend. Then, encourage your child to write that woman a letter expressing why they admire that woman.You do not have to send the letter, especially if it's to someone whose address is not ready available. Instead, hang the letter somewhere in your home.
If your child writes to someone they know, however, have them deliver the letter.

 You can use the same shampoo you used for the carpet, but one that is specifically designed for use with upholstery makes a better option. Use plenty of shampoo and mix vigorously to create a great deal of foam.The shampoo foam itself is what you will use to clean the upholstery instead of the soapy water. Upholstery, especially when made of seat cloth or velour, has a tendency to look dry even after being soaked. As such, it is very easy to over-apply cleaner if using soapy water or a spray-on shampoo.
 As you did with the car carpets, focus on cleaning one area of the upholstery at a time instead of applying the shampoo foam to the entire seating area at once. Begin on the same side you began cleaning the carpet from, and move in the same pattern.
 Lift the foam onto the bristles of your stiff bristle brush, getting as much foam as possible and as little actual water as possible. Transfer the foam onto the upholstery and firmly scrub it into the fabric using the brush. Use as little as possible to cover the upholstery.


The foam in your bucket will likely die down as you work, so you may need to re-agitate the soapy shampoo water periodically to create more foam. If necessary, you may even mix in additional shampoo.
 Press the towel into the upholstery firmly, moving it along in straight, single-direction lines to wring excess water out of the seats and into the towel.
 Most of the moisture will need to dry out naturally. Prevent mold or mildew from forming by leaving the windows rolled down or the car doors open, improving air circulation. You can even use an electric fan to speed the process along.

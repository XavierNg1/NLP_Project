 If you need to appear authoritative, choose formal business attire. Choose a color that flatters you and keep bold accessories to a minimum.
 Bring your visuals, your tablet or laptop and your speech copy.
 If you're in a small room, ask someone to stand at the back of the room and see if he or she can hear you. In a larger facility, practice using the microphone so that your speech is neither too faint nor distorted.
 Make sure that the computer, projection screen and easels are functional and positioned so that they are visible to your audience.
 You should either place them on a table for audience members to retrieve or pass them out in an organized fashion.
 If your speech is lengthy, then you will need some water to moisten your throat.
 Check both the front and the back of your outfit and make sure that your hair is neat and that your makeup, if you're wearing any, is not smudged.

 That is, if you're using it. Pre-made bolster pillow shapes are available and can be easily substituted. Just make sure they're the right size and shape beforehand.


Roll the towel so that it is the same diameter as the decorative pillow.
 Then slide the rolled towel inside. Make sure the towel maintains its shape or you'll end up with a bumpy, uncomfortable pillow.
 Turn the fabric of the pillow right-side out if you're using the batting.


Stuff the bolster pillow with the batting and hand-sew the pillow closed!

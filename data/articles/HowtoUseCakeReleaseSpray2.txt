 Most liquid cake releases should contain some type of oil (like soybean or canola oil) and a thickener (like corn starch or flour). Many commercial cake release products will also contain preservatives and stabilizers to extend their shelf life.Look for a product that comes in a squeeze bottle. This will make it easier to squirt out and use in your baking.
 Squirt about a quarter-sized amount of liquid cake release mixture onto the bottom of your cake pan. Take a silicone brush or pastry brush with bristles and dip it into the cake release mixture. Spread the mixture over the entire surface of your baking pan. Ensure that you coat the bottom, the sides, and the inner edges of the pan.Don't worry about applying too much cake release mixture. You won't be able to see it on the baked and cooled cakes.
 Once you've baked the cake according to the recipe, remove it from the oven. Set a cooling rack on top of the cake and hold the sides of the cake pan along with the rack. Carefully lift the cake and rack up and over so the cake pan is upside down. Gently lift the cake pan up and away so the cake is left on the rack to cool.


Avoid letting the cake cool in the pan. This will make it harder to release from the pan.

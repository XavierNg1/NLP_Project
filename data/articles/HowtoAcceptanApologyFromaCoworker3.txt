 You can move forward from the situation by spending some time in the other person’s shoes. This can help you better understand why the person may have acted the way they did. When you can see their actions as “human” and not all that different from what you would have done, you are ready to move on.For example, maybe your coworker made a mistake in a report because she’s sleep-deprived due to juggling her job with caring for a newborn. In such a case, it’s hardly surprising that someone may make an error.
 It’s great to foster a sense of teamwork when getting over a rift. The person may ask you how they can make amends. Use this opportunity to work together to resolve the situation and prevent it from happening again.Brainstorm possible methods for repairing the damage. For instance, you and your coworker might schedule a sit-down with the boss to explain their error and relieve you from solely taking the blame. Then, you might describe your plan for preventing future situations like this from reoccurring.
 The worst thing you can do after accepting an apology is hold the situation over your coworker’s head. If the person offered a sincere apology and tried to work with you to make amends, let the issue go., If your coworker is infamous for making mistakes and not taking ownership for their wrongdoing, use this situation as a lesson learned. Minimize contact with the person in the future to avoid being on the receiving end of their misconduct.This may also apply to situations when a coworker said something hurtful or vindictive about you behind your back, but later apologized for it. Even if they seem sincere, you may want to keep your distance in the future.

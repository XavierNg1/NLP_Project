, If you want soft curls, try doing a pre-poo. Choose an oil you like, such as coconut oil, and apply it to unwashed hair. Divide your hair into sections and work the oil in.

Avoid using shampoos with sulfates, as these can strip your hair of its natural oils., You can buy tabletop steamers online or your local beauty supply store. Steaming lifts the hair cuticle and allows warm water to penetrate the hair. This leaves your hair soft and hydrated.If you don't have money for a tabletop steamer, there are a few ways you can steam your hair for free. Let your hair hang loose in the shower, or gently spray your hair with water. Cover your hair with a plastic bag and use a blow dryer to apply indirect heat to your hair., Deep condition every time you wash. Using a deep conditioner is one of the best things you can do to keep your curls soft.Look for products that list water as the first ingredient. If you don't see water listed in the ingredients, the product won't do much to moisturize your hair.Your deep conditioning treatment should last between 20-30 minutes. If you feel that your deep conditioner isn't working after that time, try a different product.

 These can be goals, activities with friends, or even just movies you want to see.;
, Do you want to be able to play that song on the piano by the start of August? Does the movie you want to see go out of theaters in July? Write down the date you need/want to get things done by next to the activity.
 This might include summer school, family vacations, and doctor appointments.
 You can print them out from the internet or just use one that you already have.
 Make sure that you indicate what time they'll take place.
 For example, on the July 15th square, you might put "Play Star Spangled Banner on piano by today" or "Must see movie by today".
 These are:


One time activities: things that happen once. These are things that you'll do once and will only need to schedule once. This might include things like seeing a movie and going bowling with friends.
Process activities: these are activities that you need to schedule more than once. Process activities are typically things that require practice, like learning to play a song on the piano or goals, like learning to do a back flip. These often need to be broken down into smaller activities.
 Think about timing. You might want to see a movie on a Friday evening, but want to go bowling with friends on a weekend afternoon. Write the times and activities down on your calendar.
 For example, you may decide that you'll need to practice 10 times for an hour each before you will be able to do a back flip.

 Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 176 degrees Celsius. Prepare a pizza stone to bake your pizza on. Spread melted butter over it with a pastry brush.;
, Roll the cookie dough using a rolling pin, stretching it out to a large circle. Fold the edges over to form a thick crust. Lay the dough on your pizza stone to prepare for topping.

Avoid over-stretching or the crust will be extremely light and fragile once baked.
 Sprinkle the crushed graham crackers all over the crust, covering each area. Avoid pouring a lot crushed crackers in only one spot, it must be all around the pizza.
 Just like the previous step, sprinkle the chocolate chips all over the crust. Insure every spot of crust has chocolate chips. Then add the marshmallows all around the pizza.
 This step is optional but for a flavorful and tastier pizza sprinkle chopped almonds and graham cracker bears over the pizza.
 Bake until the cookie dough crust is golden and the marshmallows are lightly roasted. The chocolate chips should be fully melted. This will usually take about 10-13 minutes.
 Remove the s'more pizza from the oven and have it cool for about 5 minutes. Once cool, use a pizza cutter to slice your s'more pizza. Lay a slice on a plate and serve with cold milk.
 Your s'more pizza is now ready to be eaten. Enjoy each bite you take.

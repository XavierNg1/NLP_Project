 Place drop cloths on the floor, and open any windows and doors to allow plenty of ventilation into the area. Position the wood furniture that is to be painted on the cloths. Put on a face mask, and possibly gloves, before beginning the project.

, Maybe you're renovating a chest of drawers, or a dresser; in that case, you want to remove any hardware that's attached to the furniture before you paint it. This does two things:









It ensures that the hardware is paint-free when you reattach it, and that the entire piece will be adequately covered with paint if you decide that you want use different hardware.
 Apply most of the wood filler to the damaged part of the wood, not to the undamaged wood, although there can be some overlap (and you'll be able to sand it down later). Use the putty knife to scrape away excess wood filler and allow it to dry.









If you're going to replacing any hardware on your furniture, fill in the old holes where the previous hardware was attached. Scape flush to the board with a putty knife and let dry.
 This can be managed by using a piece of sandpaper with a sandpaper block, or by using a hand sander for larger pieces. The goal is to remove any protective varnish or lacquer that is on the surface of the wood, making it easier for the primer coat to adhere.









Pay close attention to any scroll work or other indentations in the wood, making sure to sand those by hand as thoroughly as possible.
Pay special attention to the areas where wood filler was applied. Sand enough so that the filled portions are flush with the rest of the furniture.
 Wiping gently with a clean tack cloth will help remove the residue and leave the clean surface. If necessary, use a mild detergent and wipe the wood surface dry with the cloth.

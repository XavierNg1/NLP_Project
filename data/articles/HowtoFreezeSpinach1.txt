 Place fresh spinach leaves into a large bowl, then cover them with clean, cold water.


Use your hands to mix and sort through the spinach leaves as they soak. Sort through the leaves to remove damaged leaves, weeds, insects, stones, dirt, or other debris.
 Drain the soak water and transfer the spinach to a large colander. Rinse the spinach under cool, running water for about 30 seconds.


If you're thorough enough, the first soak and rinse will probably remove most debris. For spinach that seems especially dirty, or to be extra cautious, repeat both steps twice more to remove as much dirt as possible.
 Place the spinach into a salad spinner, then use the utensil to spin away as much water as possible.


If you do not have a salad spinner, you can wrap the leaves in paper towels and gently squeeze out the excess moisture. Afterward, spread the leaves out over a layer of fresh paper towels for 10 to 15 minutes to continue drying them.
Thorough drying is especially important if you plan on freezing raw, unblanched spinach. It's not too significant when freezing blanched or pureed spinach, though.

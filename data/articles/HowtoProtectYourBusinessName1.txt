 Your local county clerk's office is usually responsible for handling DBA, also referred to as a "Fictitious Business Name" (FBN) application in some counties. A DBA lets consumers know who actually owns a company and adds a measure of protection against business name theft.


Some counties require DBAs or FBN announcements to be published in the local newspaper classified advertisements for a designated amount of time. Ask your county clerk representative if you must pay for this type of announcement.;
, A state trademark is useful for service-oriented businesses such as restaurants and hair salons that depend on local customers, since these businesses don't compete with other businesses around the nation (or world). State trademarks protect against name theft between regional businesses.
 Participating in a chamber of commerce doesn't just offer networking opportunities, but also creates local brand name recognition. Public awareness helps prevent future local entrepreneurs from stealing your business name.


Announce your new business by submitting an announcement to your chamber newsletter.

 Completely hear the other person out without interjecting, disagreeing, or judging them. Pay attention to what they are saying and say things like "Yeah, I understand" or "Uh huh." Make a conscious effort to hear them out and interpret their words to try to understand their perspective.Another tactic in active listening is rephrasing their question back to them.
Say something like, "So what you're saying is that you get angry because you work all day and the house is dirty when you get home?"

, Talk to the other person and explain why you feel the way you feel. Explain why you felt the need to win the argument and how you feel about the situation overall. Even if you know you're wrong, it doesn't invalidate your emotions. If someone unintentionally hurt your feelings and started the argument, clear the air and explain your motivations., Understand why you want to win even though you're wrong. Instead of thinking of interactions and discussions as a defeat or victory, consider what a mutual compromise can do for your life and your relationships. Aim for agreements that are mutually beneficial for all people involved.If you win an argument but you know you're wrong, the temporary satisfaction of outwitting someone will eventually wear off. It's best to be yourself and win arguments that you truly believe in.


Try to see the good in people. Instead of thinking that you want to beat this person, consider their good personality traits.
 For the argument or conflict to come to a reasonable resolution for both of you, you must understand why you want to win the argument. Many times it's because you don't want to accept the truth or you don't want to show your weakness or vulnerability.Coming to a compromise or admitting your fault may have you feeling better than if you "won" the argument.
Consider apologizing instead of arguing if you know that you're wrong.

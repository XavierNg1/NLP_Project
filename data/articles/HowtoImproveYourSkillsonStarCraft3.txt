 A good Starcraft player must be able to play many different maps many different ways.
 IcCup is a ladder and has games of players of similar skill level. For example, you will know what rank the other player is (Olympic, A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-). A good idea is to be familiar with the maps used on IcCup. They can be found on the website.
 The most popular and representative maps are:


In-box/slightly modified maps






Challenger
Big Game Hunters
The Hunters
The Lost Temple
Sherwood Forest
Dark Continent
Python


In-box campaigns






Try the original campaigns in Starcraft to keep your improvisation skills up and in top shape.
Try the other campaigns boxed with the game (under campaigns).

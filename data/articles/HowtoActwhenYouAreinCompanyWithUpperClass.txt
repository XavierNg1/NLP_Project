 You can talk about pricey things, like a trip, but you never mention how much it would cost. You may say the name of the hotel (if it was a good one), but there is no need to point out the price.;
, Do not overdress. Check what others are going to wear, and if possible prepare before with someone who is already "in the club." They will (if they like you) give you good hints about what to wear and not to wear.
 Smile, don't insult anyone, and don't pull any rude jokes.
 Don't be shy. There is no need to attack the first person that you see, but if you spot someone interesting go and talk to them.
 Be careful of how you act. If you want to come on to some one, do it very discreet. Find out if they have a boy/girl friend first. If they do, let them go. You will only be called trashy.
 Know in what order to use the forks and knives and so on.
 Don't use bad or vulgar language.

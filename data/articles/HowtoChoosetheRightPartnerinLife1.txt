 Ask yourself which personality traits, habits, or circumstances you can’t accept in a partner. Be prepared to stop seeing someone if any of your deal-breakers are present.Separate your true deal-breakers from traits that might be annoying, but aren’t the end of the world.
For instance, poor hygiene might be a true deal-breaker for you. On the other hand, you might decide you can live with a partner who likes to stay up late, even though you aren’t a night owl yourself.;
, Your partner’s personality will play a big role in determining what kind of relationship you have with them. Decide which traits your ideal partner needs to have, and which ones you could live without.For instance, you might decide your future partner needs to be trustworthy, kind, and emotionally stable.
Take your own personality and values into consideration. Most people do best with a partner who is at least somewhat similar to them.
 Imagine spending an ordinary day with your ideal partner. Think about what kinds of things you would enjoy doing together. Ask yourself how much you’re willing to alter your current lifestyle for your future partner.For instance, if you love going hiking and camping on the weekends, you would probably want to seek out a partner who likes the outdoors.
 It can be fun to make lists of “must-haves” in a future partner, but if you get too invested in your wish list, you might miss out on a great relationship. Focus on how you get along with potential partners in real life, not how well-matched you are on paper.If you must make a list, focus on just a few of the values or traits that are most important to you.
 If you insist on only seeing people who look a specific way or have a certain kind of job, you could be overlooking others who would make excellent partners.Expanding your social circle will give you the opportunity to meet more types of people.

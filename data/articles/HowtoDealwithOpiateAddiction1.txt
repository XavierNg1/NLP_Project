 Wait until the end. Someone should come introduce themselves and hand you a phone list on the back of a meeting list of your area. At this time if you are interested in going to a detox you can ask them for help to get you to a detox. If not say thank you and take the list.
, They are here to help you. If someone doesn't pick up call every number and leave a message with your return phone number. At the next nights meeting get another phone list. the more recovering addicts you can call the better your chance to stay clean.

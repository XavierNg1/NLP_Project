 These are listed below in the "Things You'll Need".

If you are 30 feet (9.1Â m) from the water (rather than 15 feet), your cord must be longer and the plywood must be heavier in relation to the cord, to easily slide this device down the main fishing line and over the swivel.;
, The slot on the side is where you will place the gaff over your main fishing line. The thin slot, in the keyhole, is where you will snag the swivel, so this slot must be thinner than the swivel.

With the drill, make a hole that is big enough to pass the cord through.
 For example, if the fish weighs 10 pounds and your main fishing line is 8 pounds test, your main line is going to break.

For bigger lines, even if your main line's breaking strength is bigger than the fish's weight, it is easier to use a cord to pull the fish up. For example, if your mainline is 18 pounds test and the fish is 10 pounds, your hands are going to hurt grasping such a small diameter line.
 Let the device slide down until it is past the swivel. Snag the swivel, by lifting the device somewhat sharply so that the leader slides into the keyhole slot. The hook and leader must be strong., The short leader line, which is between the swivel and the hook, should be stronger than the main line., For ease of attaching or removing of the leader to the swivel, use a big loop and cow hitch it. Another option would be to keep using a snap swivel but to have a split ring between the snap and the leader.

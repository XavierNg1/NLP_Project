 Even if your hair is highlighted or colored, try to categorize it into one of the main shades: black, brown, blonde, red/auburn, or gray/white. This will make it easier when it comes to choosing an eyeshadow that works best for you. , Similar to having brown eyes, all colors work with black/brown hair. However, bold colors like black, purple, yellow, green, or brown will really work in contrast to your hair color. On the other hand, if you have fair skin and dark hair, it’s best to stick to neutral colors like gold and beige, or other pastels, so your skin doesn’t look bruised., Those with blonde hair usually have fair or pale skin, so dark eyeshadow colors can be overpowering. Sticking to colors like gray, pink, black, blue, gold, or cream will enhance natural coloring without making you look bruised or tired. , Since red or auburn hair is already bold in coloring, shades like black, pink, gold, olive, or copper will help the hair to stand out more without distracting from it. Shiny or shimmery colors may pull the focus away from the brightness of the hair.
 The lighter coloring will help complement the fairness of the hair color rather than detract from it. Colors like gray, lilac, or blue will help pull out the natural highlights in the hair.
 Anything goes for “unnatural” hair colors like purple, pink, or green, however choosing opposite colors on the color wheel can help make your hair color pop even more.


For example, if you have green hair try pinks and purples to make it pop. Or if your hair is pink, try a lime green or chartreuse.
For multicolored hair, try focusing on the colors that frame your face. For example, if you have blue bangs, a gold or dusky orange would look good.

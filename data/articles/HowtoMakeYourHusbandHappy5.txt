 The rather comical old saying, "A happy wife means a happy life," actually holds a lot of weight in a marriage situation.


In order for your husband to be happy with you, you first have to be secure and happy in your own skin. Being happy stems from different behaviors, feelings, and experiences for each individual person, just make sure you are leaving time to take care of yourself in addition to your husband.
 It is important that both you and your husband take the time to nurture the relationships you have with other people in your life as well. Friends are an important part of any person's life and spending time alone with friends helps build balance in your life.


Make one night a week dedicated to hanging out separately with friends. By choosing the same night, neither spouse will feel neglected as the other hangs out with friends.
Don't talk about your spouse the entire time you hang out with your friends. Allow this time to be a sort of break from your busy, married life and re-engage with your friends and what is going on in their lives.
 It's wonderful if you and your spouse share the same interests, but make sure that you each retain your own hobbies too. If you love to read and he loves to golf, give each other space to do those things. You don't have to share everything all the time, and by giving each other space you can actually strengthen your relationship.
 Communication is key in any relationship. Be sure to tell each other how you are feeling, even if it is uncomfortable to do so. If you feel like you've been making a strong effort to make your husband happy and he isn't returning the love, tell him so! Often all you need to do to make an important change is communicate what is lacking.

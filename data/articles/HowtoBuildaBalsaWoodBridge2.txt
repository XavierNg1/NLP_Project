 For this, you want to use your drawing showing the side of your balsa bridge. This will be your guide for piecing your bridge together.


Use pieces of masking tape to tack down the drawing of the side of your bridge.
Cut a piece of sheer parchment paper larger than the foam board. Tuck its edges around the back of the board and tape them. The parchment paper keeps glue off of your drawing and allows you to use it to create both sides of your bridge.
 You can use the measurements on your drawings or just use the drawings as a template to mark each measurement with a pencil. Cutting your own strips from sheets will save you money.


Use your woodcutter in conjunction with a straight edge.
Make sure to account for all the pieces you’ll need: truss pieces, lateral bracing, and the roadway.
 After you’ve cut all your pieces, organize them into piles based on which part of your bridge they represent.


Make two piles for your sides, separate your lateral bracing pieces, and set aside your roadway.

Shot Level 1: Filming from above: This technique reduces the status and stature of the actor being filmed and is not always recommended.
Shot Level 2: Filming from below: This often used technique raises the on screen status. If the actor's feet are spread and firm on the ground, it gives him more power and strength.
Shot Move 1: Zoom in: Used to focus in on one aspect or when an actor has an important thing they are saying/doing.
Shot Move 2: Zoom out: Used to give the viewer a wider picture of what is there.
Shot Move 3: Panning left and right: Another way to give the viewer of what is there.
(Shot moves 2 and 3 are also a way to distract you from what's happening in the place you just watched.)
Shot Move 4: Frame Action: Used if a good amount of action is happening that fulfills the need to move the camera.
Shot Move 5: Follow the Action: Used if the thing to focus on does not stay in the same place.
Shot Placement 1: Small: Zoomed into a specific part of an actor.
Shot Placement 2: Medium: About 2/3 of the actor, a little scenery.
Shot Placement 3: Full: The actor's full body and scenery.
Shot Placement 4: Over the shoulder: The shoulder of a person with their back to you and medium of another character facing them. Used if you don't want to see the shoulder's face.

 This will require at least two or more takes. Even then, you should probably do it one or two more times. With digital video, it's not like you're using up resources, although do be aware that you're using up people's time and your actors might get fed up after too many takes.
 Cut out the director's speech, and add the appropriate transitions to each scene, if there is any.

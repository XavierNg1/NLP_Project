 While some caution against pairing food and beer that originate from the same region, others recommend it. It may be a personal choice, but in some cases is worth the experiment. Try a Belgian Saison with farmhouse goat cheese or an Oktoberfest with bratwurst and sauerkraut., Food and craft beer are seasonal in nature, so make the most of what’s available to you in any given season. This fall, try your hand at Oktoberfest combinations. In the summer, experiment with pairing a pilsner with summer fare., Many craft beer labels will have suggestions for pairing a particular beer with specific food suggestions. Give these a try. You may be pleasantly surprised by the results.
 Pairing food and beer is a creative endeavor and you don’t always have to follow the rules. Flex your creative muscles and try some pairings that sound like they might have potential. You may win or you may lose, but it’s definitely worth taking the risk. Have fun!

While this method is not difficult, it can be time consuming to see results. Cactus seeds could take up to a year to germinate and several years for the young cactus to begin to flower.
Unless you have a heated greenhouse, it's best to sow cactus seed in the late spring. Seed companies often offer many mixed varieties of cacti seed.
Use clean sterilized shallow pots to begin your seeds. Use a mixture of potting soil and sand. Place the seeds on the soil and cover them with just enough sand to anchor them. Keep in mind that cactus seeds don't germinate well if they have been sown too deeply.
Dampen the soil enough to wet the seed. When the soil dries out completely, use a mister to keep it moist. Do not over water.
Cover seeds with glass or plastic wrap and be sure to wipe away any condensation that may form. When seedlings appear, remove the cover. Carefully prick apart any seedlings that have grown together. Place the seedlings in light, but not in direct sunlight. Keep temperatures around 70 degrees F (21 degrees C).;

Allow the cuttings to dry and its cut edge to heal for a couple of weeks.
Place the healed cutting into a rooting medium formulated to encourage roots to grow. Make certain the cutting is right side up. If placed upside down, it will not grow. After a week, begin to water the cutting sparingly.



Avoid plants with damaged spines or those that look bruised, spindly or lopsided.
Read the directions that come with the plant or speak to a professional about the best way to care for the type of cactus you selected to grow.

 A mother cat gives off pheromones (or chemical messengers) that make her kittens feel safe. Feliway is a synthetic version of the feline pheromone that makes kittens feel safe and secure. It is available as a room diffuser, or as a spray for pet bedding. This scent will slowly reassure your cat, and make her feel like your home is a safe place. This is especially helpful if you have moved to a new home and your cat is having a hard time adjusting.


Feliway is not a quick fix; in fact, it may take two weeks to see any sign that your cat is feeling less stressed.
 Zylkene is a nutraceutical that acts on the same region of the brain as diazepam. A nutraceutical is a food supplement that has a pharmaceutical-like activity, but is not a drug. Scientists have identified a milk protein that stimulates the same part of the brain that diazepam acts on in order to calm a cat; Zylkene is made up of this milk protein.


With Zylkene, you may see a change in your cat within seven days. Generally, Zylkene will be given to the cat over the course of four to six weeks to ensure that the over-grooming habit is broken.

It's important to earn a degree accredited by the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET).
In this kind of a degree program your coursework may include topics like biology, physics, calculus, soil mechanics, hydrology, geology, environmental climatology and ocean and atmospheric dynamics.



Specialization will make you more competitive in the job market and many degree programs will allow you to concentrate your studies into a certain area.
Areas of specialization can include management of natural resources, agricultural research, mechanical and electronic systems, processing management, agricultural equipment design and building design and management.


Typically, agricultural engineers must licensed by the state where they are working.
Graduation from an Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET) approved program and some work experience are required.
The National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) has set forth a special Professional Engineering (PE) licensing exam for agricultural engineers.



While certification is not always required, it can be helpful in giving you more options in the job market. Many larger agricultural employers may require or prefer certification for their employees.
The National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies (NICET) provides certifications in general engineering as well as number of specialized engineering fields such as land management, geotechnical and industrial instrumentation.
Basic requirements for certification usually include an engineering degree, professional recommendations and work experience.

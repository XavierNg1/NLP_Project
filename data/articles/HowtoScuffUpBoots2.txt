 You can use any type of hammer. Lay the boots on the ground or on the table. Gently tap the toes and heels of the shoes with the hammer. The hammer may not produce scuff marks as well on other parts of the shoe. Do not use too much force, or you may damage the shoe more than intended. , Find a fairly large rock that you can hold with one hand. The rock should have a few sharp edges. Hold the rock and begin to buff the boot. Then, strike the heel and toe of the boot in a downward, diagonal motion. Continue to hit the boot until the desired results are achieved., Be very, very careful when using a hacksaw. Gently scrape the hacksaw over the shoes in one quick motion. You should see several small and thin marks on the boots. Then, move the hacksaw down and across the boot to see larger marks. Do not use too much force, or you may end up with holes in your shoes.

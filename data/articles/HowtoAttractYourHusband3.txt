Joining a sports team or athletic club
Going somewhere new
Taking a hike in nature

, Positive touch is essential to maintaining a connection with your partner. Make sure this positive, intimate touch is routine throughout your day--not just during sex.Find ways to initiate sensual touching in your daily life. For example, you can:

Give him frequent pecks on the cheek
Offer to give him a backrub when he's feeling sore

, Make sure your sex life doesn't remain rote or routine. Ask your husband about his sexual desires, and tell him about yours.Support one another in bringing your sexual desires to life. Even if you might not have kinks to share, you can still add spice to your marriage by shaking things up in the bedroom:


Try a new sexual position
Rent a hotel room and order room service
Hire a babysitter to watch the kids overnight so you don't have to worry about being interrupted
Massage one another

, It is normal for the frequency of sex in a marriage to decrease over time, especially if you have kids. However, you still have to focus on your sex life in order to keep your attraction strong.Tell yourself that it is better to have good, mutually pleasurable sex than it is to have a lot of bad sex.

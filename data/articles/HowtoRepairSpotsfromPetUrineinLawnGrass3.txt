 If your dog—or a neighbor’s dog—has urinated on a patch of your lawn, you can reduce the damage by watering the area. Use a hose or a large watering can and pour a generous amount of water over the spot where the dog urinated. As long as you have a mature lawn, you don’t need to worry about over-watering the patch of grass.This will help by diluting the concentrated acid in the dog’s urine, and washing the urine off of the grass.
 To use this method, dissolve 2 tablespoons of baking soda in a gallon of water (you can do this in a large watering can or pitcher). Then, pour the baking soda mixture over the spot where the pet has urinated. The baking soda will neutralize the ammonia and nitrogen present in dogs’ urine, and prevent the soil from turning brown.As an added benefit, baking soda is harmless to dogs. So, if your dog walks through the baking soda-soaked grass and licks their feet, they won’t be harmed.
 If you don’t want brown dog-urine spots across your lawn, you can train your dog to only urinate in one concentrated area. You can teach your dog to pee in a single location by sticking a “pee post” in the ground. “Pee posts” are treated with pheromones and designed to attract your dog’s attention so that they urinate on the post.You can purchase a “pee post” at your local pet-supply store.
If part of your lawn is covered with stones or mulch, have your dog urinate there, since those materials won’t be harmed by the acidity.

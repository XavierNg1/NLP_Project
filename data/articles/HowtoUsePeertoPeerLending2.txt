You will be required to create a borrower profile that includes your Social Security number and personal information. Be sure to borrow from a site with a secure server to protect the financial information of you and your lender.



Be honest when listing your average annual income and other information required to create your borrower's profile and assign your risk rating. Inflating these numbers won't necessarily improve your risk rating. Give accurate information so you can be matched up with a lender that best meets your needs.



Decide what debts you are aiming to pay with the person-to-person loan and request only that amount. Requesting more than you need could make it more difficult for you to pay back the loan on time.



Pay your loan payments on time. Immediately notify the lender if you have a problem making a payment. This communication could help you avoid late fees or fines that could be assessed by the lending site.

 You will need to keep this in mind while writing the lyrics so you can target them. After all, if you were writing a song for children, you would avoid adult material of any kind.;
, For example, the subject of the song might be falling in love, the message might be that there is someone for everyone, and the story might tell of a man and a woman who meet and fall madly in love.
 The chorus is a bridge or connection from one verse to the next. It must make sense to sing the words of the chorus in between all of the verses. From the chorus, you will also need to make up a catchy title for your song.
 This verse should draw attention to your song and make your audience want to listen. Don't worry about it being perfect at this point, you will refine all of the verses and the chorus later.
 In this part you will need to continue to tell the story and explain what the action is. Don't be too detailed, this is a three-minute song, not an opera.
 Tell more about your story here, and add relevant information. You really want to advance the storyline from verses one and two, because the next verse will close the song.
 The aim is to bring it all together like the last chapter of a book.
 After you have lines, you will need to go back and change the ending words so they will rhyme. Do this with the chorus too. Every lyric should be of similar length so the song will glide along and not be choppy.
 If composing is not your thing, you could work with someone who can compose and complete your song.

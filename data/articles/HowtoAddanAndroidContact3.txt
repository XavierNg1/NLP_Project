 If you have many contacts but only speak to a few of them, adding favorite contacts can be an easy way to access your most frequently contacted people. To add favorites from the Contacts app:


Tap on a contact to bring up their contact card.
Tap on the star icon to add them to your favorites. The contact will now appear on your favorites tab.
 From the Contacts screen, tap the "More" button and select the option "Contacts to display". You will now be able to select which contacts you would like visible and which contacts you would like to hide from your contact list.


This option is particularly useful if you would like to hide contacts from an app with its own contact list, such as Facebook or Whatsapp., If you have imported contacts from different apps, accounts, or SIMs on your phone, it's likely that you'll have a number of contacts listed twice, which can be annoying to sort through if each contact has different information. From the contact screen, click the "More" button and select "Find and merge duplicates". This option will find all the contacts with identical pieces of contact information and put all of their information into the same contact card.

 These materials can be formed into chic, tailored pieces, but are heavy enough to provide you with warmth.
 Coats and boots can be lined with it, or you can wear an entire scarf made of fur. These pieces are naturally very warm and look remarkably luxurious.
 The fashion rules of old have been bent and broken throughout the years, and white is no longer strictly banned after Labor Day. A white dress coat made of a heavy material can look just as chic and sophisticated as a black or brown coat.
 These coats typically nip in at the waist, creating a flattering silhouette on most women. The style is also relatively timeless and has consistently remained in fashion for years.
 Swing jackets blend the structure of a standard jacket with the volume and flare of a capelet. The arms and torso of the coat "swing" away from the body, creating a sophisticated look.
 Think ruffles and bows. The playfulness of these designs contrast well with bland, dreary winter landscapes.
 Insulated leather coats keep you warm on cold days, and leather gives your style a tough yet trendy twist.
 Choose scarves in a variety of colors and materials. Larger pashmina scarves may even be able to double as shawls for semi-formal occasions, as long as the print on the scarf is relatively subdued.
 Riding boots have a flat heel, making them more practical for icy terrain than skinny heel boots.
 Some dresses and trousers may look better with a smart pair of ankle boots than they would with a fashion-forward pair of over-the-knee boots. If you opt for a heeled ankle boot, look for one with a wider heel rather than one with a narrow heel.
 Try a variety of styles to determine which ones suit the shape of your face best. Think wool bucket hats, berets, fedoras, and more.

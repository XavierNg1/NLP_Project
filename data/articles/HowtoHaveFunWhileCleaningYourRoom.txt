 Throw all papers away and if you find pieces to a game, chuck those too, unless you know what game they go to. If you don't, the game is not important enough.;
, Give yourself a half hour or else the clock wins, and no one likes losing to a thing that doesn't have a brain.
 Most of the time this is very helpful in getting you in the mood to clean. If you have the music on, you could tidy whilst dancing. For instance, if you had something one side of the room and it needed to be the other, you could twirl, fox trot or even Cha-Cha your way there! Put on your phone music!!

, This will help you start cleaning your room. Don't look at it as the big picture because you will get discouraged.
 This just leads to procrastination.
 This will help you clean faster. Make sure you really want to do this goal, though.
 Turn on the radio, and listen to a local radio station. These are the words to live by while you are cleaning and throughout your life.
 Parents will most likely look under the bed, and in your closet as well. In other words, actually clean your room, don't just shove trash and junk in places that seem convenient just to get it over with. Only put things in your closet or under your bed if it really belongs there.
 If your parents do it for you, you will never learn from experiences that you will come upon later in life.
 You may become distracted very easily!

, You won't be tempted by the snacks in the pantry when you're cleaning.
 Then, fast forward your video and show all your friends how hard working you are!

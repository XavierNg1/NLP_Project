 You ribbons can be any length you want them to be.The thinner the ribbon is, the better. Something between 1/16 and ¼-inch (1/16 and 0.62-centimeter) wide would be ideal.


Can't find any white ribbon? Try silver.
 You want small, medium, and large buttons. They can have two holes or four holes, but they need to be flat. Avoid shank or coat buttons. If you'd like, you can get buttons with interesting textures.


For a fancier garland, use silver rhinestones., Place the larger buttons near the top, and the smaller buttons near the bottom. When you are done, you should have something that looks like tapering spikes—or icicles., Pick the button up, place a drop of hot glue on the back, then quickly press it down into the ribbon.Continue gluing the buttons one by one until you are done.


It might be a good idea to work over a cookie sheet or a piece of parchment paper. This way, if any glue leaks out, you won't ruin your table.
Work on one button at a time. Hot glue sets up quickly.
 This will make the base for your garland, so you can make it any length you want. You might want to cut it a little longer than you want it, however. This will give your garland a nice drape. You can use some white, cotton cord, or more white ribbon.


If you wish to hang your garland up, tie loops into each end of the string.
Avoid using thread or fishing line. This won't give your icicles enough area to stick to.
 Turn an icicle over, and place a drop of hot glue on the back, near the top. Quickly press the icicle into the string.Work on one icicle at a time. Hot glue hardens fast.


If you used rhinestones, consider gluing more matching rhinestones to the back of each icicle.

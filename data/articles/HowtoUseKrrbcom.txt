 Setting up your account with Krrb is free and as easy as 1,2,3. All you have to do is make a username, upload a snapshot of yourself and write a quick bio. There’s other information you can add, but that’s up to you!;
, For this you’ll need to add a title, give the details, put in keywords, upload some quality photos and price your item. You can also choose to have your items listed on the Apartment Therapy Classifieds and/or the Chicago Magazine Classifieds. That’s it! The easy to use format makes it possible for anybody to post a listing to the Krrb site!


All of your information that you have chosen to share, plus your listings, will make up your Krrb Corner. Your Corner is your very own virtual shop so be sure to make it great. After all, it will be representing you!
Be responsive to potential buyers. People will contact you about your item, and you just have to be friendly and respond to them about what they want to know. If they’re interested in purchasing your item, then you can arrange with them whether the item will be shipped or picked up.
 Using Krrb to shop around is just as easy as selling! On the homepage you can search any keyword that you want, or choose to see everything!


You can also adjust the bar at the top so you can either see either items close by or from all around the world (and everything in between!)






If you come across an item you like, you can click on it to learn more about it and see more about the person who posted it. From here you can message the member to inquire about the posting you’re interested in.

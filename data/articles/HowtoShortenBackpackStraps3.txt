 Make sure the backpack is flush to your back and is not sagging past your behind.If you notice there are other straps on your backpack that are unnecessarily long, you can use this method to fold the straps.
 You will need 5-6 inches of fastening tape per strap to ensure it can wrap around the folded strap. Fastening tape is the best option for this method, but you can also use rubber bands, zip ties, or twine., Begin at the end of the straps and roll the straps so they lie flat and even in a bundle. Once the straps have been folded up, secure them with the fastening tape by wrapping the tape around the straps.

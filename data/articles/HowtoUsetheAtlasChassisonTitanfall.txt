 The Atlas is the titan unlocked by default. However, to unlock the others, you must beat the campaign.;

Atlas has moderate armor. Go ahead and run Vortex Shield, as you can either get out and deal with pilots or crouch to fool them, unlike the Stryder.
The Atlas is sort of "the best of both worlds". It has moderate armor and speed and specializes at nothing.



Using Vortex Shield, catch Archer Heavy Rockets. Then throw them back. How to do this for first- time trying: At the bottom of the HUD, it will say "Pilot Locking" and point a direction, Turn that direction and hold the Vortex Shield. Locate the pilot, and release the Vortex Shield to throw it at them. It's OK if the rockets miss, it prevents major shield and hull damage.
Friendlies can fire bullets into your vortex shield. May be a bug, but make use of it!
A rumor: The vortex shield blocks from behind. If you're going to try this, go in a private match.
 A loadout that works well is: XO-16 Chain gun with extended mags, Slaved Warheads, Vortex Shield, Regenerator (regenerates bodyshield faster), Core Accelerator (explained below).
 Don't use it right away! Use it on enemy Titans and the dropship. Targeting a Titan's weak points with double damage and the XO-16, a fast firing weapon, can take down a hulky Ogre in about 5 seconds (if every shot lands, which isn't likely).
 This can be used somewhat like the Stryder. Dashes take 4 seconds to recharge, compared to the Stryder's 3 and Ogre's 5 second time.
 Deal damage to Pilots, kill Grunts and Spectres and Pilots, and try to deal damage to Titans. Core Accelerator helps a ton.

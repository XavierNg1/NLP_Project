 Resistance to change may be deeply embedded in fear. We tend to cling to the past which is more secure and predictable. If something has worked well for us in the past, we may fear not accomplishing as much in the future.;
, The attitude of "I already know all that I need to know", is destructive and damaging, both to oneself and to those around us.
 New routines may well create a loss of control, and these feelings will prevent you from growing. Remember that these new routines, may very well become a part of your life in the future, just like the way in which these older ones are a part of you now.
 When people are stressed and under pressure, change may be the last thing they need. It is important to prepare yourself in advance in order to embrace change.
 Doing things in the same manner is comfortable. By changing the way you do things, will move you beyond and outside your comfort zone. It is okay to experience things differently sometimes.
 By not seeing the bigger picture, you may fail to see the positive impact of the change in your life as a whole. Thus do not simply look at change as disruptive and unnecessary.
 We resist change just because something is unfamiliar. Always understand that change may not necessarily make matters worse.
 Very often if we distrust or dislike a person who is leading the attempted change, our lack of enthusiasm becomes very evident.
 This involves worrying more about the changes or the problems, rather than becoming a part of it. This will add to the anxiety and set you back considerably.

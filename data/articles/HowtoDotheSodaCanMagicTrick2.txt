 You want to convince someone of the authenticity of the act you’re about to perform. Plant the can ahead of time and wait for the right moment to reach for the soda. Approaching a friend with the soda can in hand is less impressive!Try remarking: “Man, you thirsty? I could use something to drink.”
Or say surprisingly: “I can’t believe someone threw away a perfectly good soda!”

, With your thumb over the hole you used to drain the can, shake the soda up. The pressure buildup will restore the sides of the can as if they had never been crushed. It will appear as though the soda can is refilling with liquid.


Make sure your finger is firmly over the pinhole you created. If you've ever dropped a soda or shotgunned a beer, you know that the carbonated beverage will find any way possible to relieve pressure.
 Sell this as an act of “restoring” the can to its original state. Give it a little “magic” hand wave as you rub the ink away. Make sure your audience can see the can’s tab prior to and after the removal of the ink so they can witness your magic.


This part isn’t strictly necessary, as you could simply open an already “opened” soda can. However, it will save you from getting a mouthful of ink.
 Give the soda a nice long swig. You can also pour it into a cup to better show off the fact that you “magically” refilled the can with liquid. Make sure to pour out all of the soda so that you can remove your finger from the drainage hole.


Depending on how much soda was drained from the can, you might have to deal with a little soda spillage due to the overflowing carbonation.

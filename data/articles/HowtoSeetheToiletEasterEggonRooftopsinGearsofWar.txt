 You can either join a Rooftops match or host your own. However, it may be advisable to view this Easter egg while playing in a player or local match, rather in a ranked multiplayer game, as other players may get annoyed if you are not trying to play and win.;
, On side of Rooftops is far darker than the other; this is the side you want to be on.
 You should be facing away from the centre of the map, towards a damaged, multi-level building on the outside of the level.
 There will be one undamaged window, with two broken windows on either side; the Toilet Easter Egg is behind the unbroken window.
 Using the Smoke grenade is far easier than viewing the Easter egg with the Hammer of Dawn, although it won't light up the area as much for you to see.
 Or alternatively, aim and fire the Hammer of Dawn at the middle window until it lights the room inside up.
 There will be a giant dead body sitting on the toilet by the middle window. This is the Toilet Easter Egg.

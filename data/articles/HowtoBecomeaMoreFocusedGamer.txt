 While playing a video Game, it is best to sit down in a nice sturdy chair. The best posture is sitting down, with both feet on the ground, at a 100-degree angle. This takes pressure off the back and helps with comfort.;
, Take a shower, even if it's a quick three-minute navy shower. Wash and dry off your hands and face well, dry and comb your hair, and wear comfortable clothing! It makes a big difference. Another good tip to get your reflexes nice and jittery is to wash with some sort of mint body wash. Mint leaves a nice cooling sensation on the body, which generally leads to good comfort.


Avoid having greasy hands by any and all means. This may become difficult if your hands are moisturized; in that case, go and do something else until they feel wet without actually looking wet. Dry off with a hand towel, and see if they are still greasy. If they are, just wait it off-maybe go to GameFAQs to get/give some help!







, And of course, the next logical step would be to be confident. And make sure to write "gaming" on that list you're making! Don't just be generally confident; be gaming-confident., If you wear contacts, make sure they are not dry. If you wear glasses, make sure they are clean.
 Finally, have a lot of fun. There's not much one can say on either, except that just keep doing what makes you tick.

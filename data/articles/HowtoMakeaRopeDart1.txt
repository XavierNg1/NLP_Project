 There are many different styles that can be adapted to different lengths of rope dart. Generally speaking, to get the most versatility out of your rope dart you should first measure out a distance that spans fingertip to fingertip with your arms outstretched. Hold your rope at this length, and then add to it the distance between your shoulder and the floor.Leave yourself some extra slack, so that you can fashion a loop at the end for easier handling.
Extra rope is also important in case you find a long rope style suits you best.
Making your rope dart too long can result in damage caused by the head of your dart dragging on the ground. This will decrease the life of your rope dart.;
, You'll want the loop to be big enough to fit your hand, but not so big that it's clumsy or bulky.A bowline knot will be ideal for making a sturdy loop in the end of your line. To make a bowline knot:


Form a loop where you want the base of your loop to be. The length between your loop and the end of your rope will form your handle.
Thread the end of your line up through the loop.
Bring the end behind the line and back down through the loop.
Pull tight to fasten the knot securely., Open the blade on your multi-tool or take a sharp knife and slit each ball once on opposing sides with your cutting tool. The slits should be big enough so that, when squeezed, the ball allows enough room for the rope to feed through.Be careful not to make your slit too big. Doing so could result in your tennis ball falling apart.
 One at a time, thread each tennis ball by squeezing the sides to force the slit you have made to gape open. Then, feed the loose end of your rope through to the other side and do the same for your next two tennis balls.


Tie off the end of your line with a simple knot to prevent your tennis balls from coming loose.
The tennis balls on the end will simulate the weight and drag caused by an actual rope dart head, which is traditionally made of metal.

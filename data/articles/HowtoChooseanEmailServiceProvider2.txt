 Managing your subscribers is one of the most important services an email service provider provides. Research how the provider manages subscription forms, unsubscribe centers, and subscriber content preferences. These are all key to acquiring and personalizing email services for your subscribers., The IP address your email service provider assigns you indicated the origin of an email. You do not want to share an IP address with other customers at your email service provider. For example, excessive spam complaints against another client with the same IP address could prevent your emails from being delivered., Before you decide on an email service provider, ask the company about email deliverability rates. You want to make sure the emails you are sending end up in subscribers’ inboxes instead of getting marooned in cyberspace or spam filters., Your email service provider should have multiple, high speed Internet connections through several sources. This will ensure reliability should one of the Internet connections fail. For example, if your email service provider’s Internet connection goes down, your subscribers won’t be able to click links in the emails you send., An email service provider provides detailed reporting on your email campaigns. This reporting should include the rates at which subscribers open emails, daily delivery success rates, and the rate at which subscribers click links included in the emails. You should be able to view which of your subscribers completed each of these actions. This will help you measure how effective your email campaigns are.

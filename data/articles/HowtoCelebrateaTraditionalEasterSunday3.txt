 Although the symbol of the egg is rooted in a pagan springtime fertility feast, Christians have adopted the egg as an Easter symbol that represents new life. In many areas of the world, people color and decorate hard-boiled eggs as part of their Easter celebrations.
 Once the eggs are decorated, children search for eggs hidden throughout their homes or gardens. In some traditions, the Easter Bunny hides the eggs on Easter morning for the children to find later that day.
 Like the egg, the rabbit was a symbol of fertility associated with the pagan festival of Easter. In the 1500s, the Germans began using the Easter Hare as a symbol of rebirth at Easter. On the night before Easter, children would make nests from their bonnets and caps and leave them outside, where the Easter Hare would leave colorful eggs for them. Today, a common tradition is that the Easter Bunny brings baskets filled with candy to children on Easter morning.
 The Germans are credited with inventing the chocolate Easter bunny in the 1800s. The chocolate bunny is now a traditional symbol of Easter. Other traditional types of Easter candy include chocolate eggs, marshmallow chicks and jelly beans.
 The tradition of the Easter parade began in the 1800s as people walked down 5th Avenue in New York City after Easter Sunday church services. Now many cities offer Easter parades on Easter Sunday or the day before Easter.
 The tradition of wearing new clothes on Easter dates back centuries, as people chose to celebrate new birth with new clothing. They referred to their new clothes as their "Easter best." Today, people around the world dress up in their finest attire for Easter church services. In many traditions, women wear white gloves and hats, which are often called Easter bonnets.

If you blow dry your hair, only blow dry it until it's slightly damp., Take large hair curlers and use your fingers to section off a small section near the front of your head. Strand by strand, secure the front of your hair with the curlers. Use your fingers to work the hair around the curlers and leave them in place as you proceed., Once your hair in front is sectioned off, roll the remainder of your hair in the rollers. Use your fingers to roll your into the curlers strand by strand. When you're done, all of your hair should be secured in curlers., The longer you leave the rollers in, the larger your curls will be. Most hair will set in about an hour, but leave your curlers in longer if you want bigger, more dramatic hair., After letting your rollers sit, slowly remove each roller. Use your fingers to twist the rollers out of each strand of hair., After the rollers are removed, tease your hair. Work your fingers through each strand of hair to straighten your hair, reduce frizz, and create slightly more volume. When done, you should have a feathered 70's style.If you want, you can set the look with a spritz of hairspray.

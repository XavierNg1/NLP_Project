, What you wear sends a clear message to the people around you about the type of person you are. Make sure that you’re sending the right messages. Avoid clothes that are suggestive, attention-seeking or reputation damaging.


“Women should wear proper clothes that show respect and self-control” – 1 Timothy 2:9,10

, It is true that actions speak louder than words. Small actions make a big difference- think about ways to reach out to your community, to the needy, the lonely and the homeless.


“Love your neighbour as you love yourself”- Matthew 22:39b

, Carry a Bible with you. Scribble your thoughts and feelings down inside, highlight important passages and refer to it often. Find a way to set aside a small amount of time each day to spend with the Bible.


“Be sure that the book of the Law is always read in your worship. Study it day and night and make sure that you obey everything in it”- Joshua 1:8

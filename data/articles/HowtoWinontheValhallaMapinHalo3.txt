 For example, the shotgun is located in the cave on the snowy side of the map, and the sniper rifle is beside the inner ramp on both bases.;
, Look across from the turret, towards the metal wall. You can jump in the little pile of rocks and it's a great sniping spot. Places like these are often overlooked.
 A Wraith, Banshee, Warthog and two Mongooses are present in each base.
 There is one present in each base and can lock onto vehicles.
 For example, if someone is hiding behind the wall next to the man cannon in a base and jumping up and down while you're trying to snipe them to taunt you, snipe the Fusion Coil while they're in the air to create a big explosion.
 For example, practice hijacking a Banshee, and know that running towards a Wraith head-on isn't a very good strategy.
 For example, driving around in a Mongoose for apparently no reason will put people off their guard, when you're actually going to the other base to get the sniper.
 You knew this was coming. But really, you can only really get good at this map once you play it again and again.

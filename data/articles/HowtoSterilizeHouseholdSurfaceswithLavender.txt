 You can get the lavender oil at a health food store.;
, Mix together and let sit for a little time to disperse.
 Lavender is a natural anti-bacterial and anti-viral plant. The best part is - it won't hurt you and it'll smell great.
 Don't use the oil full strength though, it could burn the skin.
 Just squirt and relax. Let Mother Nature do the disinfecting for you.

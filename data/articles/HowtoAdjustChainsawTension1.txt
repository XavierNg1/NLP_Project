 This is the small cap, often on the button you use to prime the chainsaw. Disconnect it so that the motor cannot get the electricity required to start., This is not only for your safety but also for the health of the blade. Granted, touching it once or twice won't kill it, but it is better for both you and the chainsaw if you keep gloves on at all times.
 The bar is the long "knife" of the chainsaw -- the part you use to guide the blade and actually cut. The chain should wrap snugly around the whole bar, not be hanging off the bottom side. If it is hanging, you'll need to adjust the tension.The Snap Test: Wearing gloves and goggles, hold onto the top of the saw. With the other hand, lift the chain off the bar several inches and let go. If it doesn't snap back into place cleanly, you'll need to adjust the tension.
For precise work, you want about a 1.25mm space between the blade and the bottom of the bar when the motor is cool. A hot motor and chain will slightly expand the chain, loosening it slightly., For older models, this plate likely comes right out. For newer ones, there may be two screws holding it down. At the very least, loosen these two screws a full turn so that the blade and chain have room to shift as you adjust the tension.
 If the cover comes all the way off, use this chance to wipe down the entire assembly, assuring the blade runs cleanly without unnecessary friction. Otherwise, get a can of compressed air and shot it into the loosened covering to remove dirt and dust.A toothbrush is a good way to help remove tricky, hard to reach bits.
 This sprocket is vital to keep the blade moving efficiently. Add a touch of grease so that it can spin freely, and then wipe up any excess with a dirty rag.If you're adding a new chain and want to adjust it, click here.

 Whether you're standing on a mounting block or on the ground, you should stand next to your horse's left front leg. This allows you to reach the stirrup easily without sacrificing control of your horse.
 Keep them tight enough that you can control your horse if it moves away, but be careful not to pull too hard on your horse's mouth.
 This is much easier when using a mounting block, but doable from the ground as well.


If you're mounting from the ground, drop your left stirrup several holes to make it easier to reach. You can shorten your stirrup to the right length once you're sitting on your horse.
 Your left hand should still be holding the reins, but you can grab the pommel of the saddle if necessary. Use your right hand to grab the pommel, a handful of mane at the base of your horse's neck, or the front of the saddle on the right hand side. Avoid grabbing the back of the saddle, as it's less secure and pulling on it can cause the saddle to slip.
 Landing hard in the saddle can hurt your horse's back, so be careful to land gently in the saddle. Adjust your stirrups if necessary, position the reins properly in your hands, and you're ready to go!

 Use a sharp serrated knife to cut the delicata squash in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds and interior fibers with a metal spoon.

A serrated knife will break the skin of the squash more easily and is safer to use than a smooth blade.
You could also remove the seeds with a melon-baller.
 Place the halves cut-side down., Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water into the dish and cover with a lid or microwave-safe plastic wrap.

You may also use vegetable broth instead of the water for an added boost of flavor.
If desired, you can also add a dash of salt to the water for flavor.
Make sure that the dish is tightly covered.
 The delicata squash should be tender enough to pierce easily with a fork.

If the squash is not tender, continue cooking in 1 minute intervals until it is.
 Cool the squash for 10 minutes and serve the squash skin and all. Eat the squash by digging the flesh directly out of the skin or by cutting it into thinner slices after pulling it out of the microwave.

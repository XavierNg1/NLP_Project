 In "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince," Luna wears this hat to show support for Gryffindor in the Gryffindor vs. Slytherin Quidditch game, even though she herself is in Ravenclaw.Purchase a lion hat like Luna’s. You might be able to find one at a costume store or online, especially online craft stores such at Etsy.com.


You can also make a lion hat. You could do this in many creative ways, but one way to do it could be starting with a bike helmet as a baseand then adding the lion’s head on top and covering the rest with fabric. You can make the lion’s head yourself, or you can buy a stuffed lion and cut the head off to attach to the bike helmet with glue. You could also papier mache the lion’s head and then glue it to the bike helmet.
Add the lion’s mane with crepe paper, yarn, or any other orange and yellow fabric, gluing it securely onto the bike helmet and covering it completely.
Luna’s style is fun and creative. Don’t be afraid to add your own style and flare to the lion hat.
 In this scene in the movie, Luna complements the yellow and orange of the lion’s head hat with purple corduroys. If you do not have purple corduroys, you could also wear a bright blue or even yellow. Maintain the important part of Luna’s style here, which is the brightly colored pants. You can probably buy them inexpensively at a thrift store or a used clothing store.
 In the movie, Luna wears a thin, gray, long-sleeved top. She pairs it with a blue knitted sweater vest. Though you do not have to follow this exact combination, you should try to copy Luna’s quirky layering.

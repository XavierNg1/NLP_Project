 Make sure that she knows that she can trust you with her secrets, because you can keep them. Tell her some of your secrets too, so she knows that you trust her. If she confides in you, keep whatever is shared between the two of you, so that she can feel safe telling you her feelings and thoughts in the future., Allow yourself to be truthful about your feelings and needs. If you do this, your girlfriend will feel more comfortable coming forward with her expectations in the relationship, and this can strengthen the trust between you both., Just like getting to know her, the more time you spend with her, the more comfortable she'll be around you. This doesn't mean spending every second of the day with her, but could mean simply going on a date once a week, hanging out at school, eating lunch together, and engaging in other fun activities.
 If you want to slowly and carefully build a healthy relationship, you can start with a low-key date, such as at a coffeeshop. If you want something a bit more engaging, try a round of bowling or mini golf. Avoid the movies for a first date, since this typically leaves little time for conversation before or after the movie., If something is bothering your girlfriend, it is likely that you will pick up on a change in her tone or behavior. Ask her what is wrong, and try to address the matter right away. Feel free to ask her specifically what you can do to make her feel better. She will likely have a simple request or resolution.

If you show that you can not only solve the issue but also avoid making the same mistake in the future, she will greatly appreciate your presence in her life. Your goal is to become a calming and reliable person for her, so go out of your way to ease any of her pain.

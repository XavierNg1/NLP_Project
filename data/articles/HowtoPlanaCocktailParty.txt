 Two weeks prior to the party, send out the invitations to your guests.;
, There are several possible ways to go about this:


Look online for suitable cocktail recipes (wikiHow has a great selection).
Check out books for ideas. There is a great range of cocktail books available; your local library is a great source.
 Make sure that you can get all the ingredients for your drinks at this time and order in anything needed.
 As with the drink ingredients, be sure that you can get all the ingredients prior to the event.
 Buy the decorations too! Purchase the ingredients for the drinks need this day or the next day. Food needs to be bought also. Today is also a good day to find your dress/clothes. Purchase non-perishable food ingredients.
, This day you will spend most of the time organizing last minute details and playing host.

 Do two scarf juggling with the exception of clicking when your second throw is half-way threw its fall. Repeat this until you get used to it., Repeat the last step with one exception: when you were clicking before, now throw the third scarf. This is essentially the same as juggling two scarfs except there is always one scarf in the air., Every time you want to juggle three scarfs, have two in one hand and one it the other. Start juggling by throwing one of the scarfs in the hand with two scarfs.

 Many formal gowns (including prom dresses) require alterations for a perfect fit, and you will want to allow enough time to complete these alterations.


If you don't get to buy a prom dress before the listed time, then just shop for a ready-made dress you would love to wear on your special night. There will always be a dress you like, even if it isn't a very fancy one.

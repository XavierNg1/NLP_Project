 Many pools and clubs have programs available for kids, but few accommodate aspiring adults or teens. Seek out someone who has had experience working with adults. Make sure their personality fits with yours. You'll need someone who can listen and provide feedback on your strokes., The U.S. Masters Swim Group is a good program for people over twenty looking for a group to swim with. They vary from complete beginners to more seasoned athletes.


Your local gym or health club might also offer something similar, and could be a better alternative.
 You'll find that many facilities near you have pools. Shop around and find the one that is best fit for your price range that has a decent pool.
 If you are committing yourself to something physically demanding, it might be good for you to have someone who will support you. This person doesn't need to do the exercises with you, but they'll merely act as a support system if you become discouraged.


Having a friend who is willing to commit to a swim routine with you is an extra bonus and a good friend.

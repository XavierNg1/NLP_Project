 Before you go inside your house, try to get as much mud as possible off the shoes. Wipe and stomp your feet on the grass. You can also try wiping your shoes on a rug. Just try to get as much mud off as you can., As soon as you come in from outside, take off your shoes. Let the mud dry before you try to brush it off. This can help thick mud come off easier.
 Choose a shoe brush, nail brush, or toothbrush. Brush the dried, caked mud to remove as much as you can. Try to brush quickly and with pressure to get the mud off., For those hard to get crevices on the bottom and sides of your shoes, use a chopstick to pick out the mud. Drag the pointy end through the crevice to pull out dirt that is caked in.You can also try to use a toothpick if you don’t have chopsticks.
 If the mud is still caked on and won’t come off, try using a garden hose. Spray the outside of the shoe with the direct spray of the hose. The force of the water from the hose may help dislodge mud from the shoe.

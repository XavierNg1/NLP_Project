 As with any contest, you need to adhere to the tenants in order to have any shot at actually winning. If a contest is looking for entries under 700 words, do not send in an 800 word piece. Similarly, if contest entries must follow a certain theme, do not send in a story that has nothing to do with the theme.
 Nowadays, many online writing contests ask writers to use an online submission process that goes through a submission management system. If the contest specifically states that you should go through this system, e-mailing your entry or sending it via snail mail is grounds for disqualification.
 If you plan on entering the contest online, you will need a credit card. If you do not have a credit card, you may need to search for a contest that will allow you to send your entry in by mail and pay the fee by check or money order.

,, Alcohol is necessary if your fly rod has fiberglass or graphite ferrules; if your fly rod has metal ferrules, you can often get by with using just a clean, soft cloth to clean the male ferrule.
, A thin coating of paraffin (candle wax) or silicone grease is recommended. Lubricating the ferrules makes it easier to assemble and disassemble your fly rod.


Don't lubricate the ferrule by rubbing it against the side of your nose, as the ferrule will pick up dirt from your skin as well as its natural oils.
When putting your fly rod together or taking it apart, push and pull the sections straight if your rod has metal ferrules. If your rod has fiberglass or graphite ferrules, you can use a twisting motion when assembling or disassembling the rod.

 We breathe differently when we are calm than we do when we are anxious, and deep breathing sends a signal to the body that it’s time to relax. Close your eyes and feel your body settle into the ground. Take in a deep breath through your nose, then breath out slowly through your mouth. Imagine your stress escaping your body as you exhale., Make yourself comfortable and rub your hands over your neck and shoulders or calves and feet. You can also roll a tennis ball over your muscles with the palm of your hand.You can also apply pressure to pressure points like the skin between your thumb and forefinger. This one is especially handy if you get stressed out in a meeting or other place where you can’t give yourself a full-on massage., Another great way to beat feelings of stress is to change your environment for a few minutes. Five minutes outside in the sunshine can do wonders for your mood. If you can’t go outside, even just getting away from your current setting can break those anxious feelings. Grab a cup of tea or chat with a friend—anything to give your mind a mini-vacation from whatever is stressing you out., Studies suggest that spending time with an animal you’ve bonded with can relieve stress. Even something as simple as petting a cat or dog can calm your nerves and make you feel happier. Your pet will never judge you—they’re just happy to get some of your attention. If you don’t have a pet of your own, borrow a friend’s., Music is another mood-booster. Turning on some slow-rhythmed, up-beat tunes can make you feel happier, steady your heart rate, and release endorphins.Try making a playlist of songs that make you feel happy when you hear them. That way when you’re stressed, you can just start listening.

 Run a couple of air stones from the air pump and keep them in here. Nutrient solution reservoirs should always be oxygenated in this way. The water pump also goes into this container.;
, In the bottom of this container (out of the way of the plants), drill two 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) holes. In one hole you install the flood and drain fitting (the shorter of the two). In the other hole you install the overflow fitting.
 Plug your water pump into the timer to flood the upper tray for a half hour, four times per day while the lights are on. The upper container will flood from the shorter fitting, but never higher than the overflow. When the pump kicks off, the top container will drain back into the nutrient reservoir through the shorter fitting.
 How to grow hydroponically really means how to feed your plants right. You should know the nutrient requirements of the plants you grow, as well as know how to maintain a nutrient solution reservoir daily for success.

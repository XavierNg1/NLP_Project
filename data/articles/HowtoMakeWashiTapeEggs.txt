 You might like to focus on pastel colors for an Easter theme. Or, choose Washi tape that you just happen to like the designs of.;
, The Washi tape can be added in various ways:

Place strips from the top of the egg to the bottom of the egg.






Place the strips around the middle of the egg.






Place the strips around the middle of the egg and other strips from top to bottom of the egg, to make a cross effect.






Place the strips diagonally across the egg.






Wrap the egg like a mummy, or any which way. This is ideal for young children; let them do it however they fancy.








Try drawing designs on paper and using small pieces of Washi tape on the paper if you're not quite sure what you'll like. When you're happy with the design choice, proceed to the next part.
 The pieces will need to be long enough to go around the egg or to extend from top to bottom.


Remove the adhesive from the back, ready to stick onto the egg.
 Follow your original design to make up the egg.
 Finish off the last piece tidily, ensuring that all of the egg has been covered neatly.
 Choose matching Washi tape for the best effect.

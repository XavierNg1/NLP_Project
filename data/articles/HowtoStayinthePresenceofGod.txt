 Achieve this through spending time with others; when God's children are united, it is a blessing!


Read Psalm 133:1-3 - Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious oil upon the head, running down on the beard, the beard of Aaron, running down on the edge of his garments. It is like the dew of Herman, descending upon the mountain of Zion; for there the Lord commanded a blessing- life forevermore.
;
, Who would not want a blessing from God for enjoying unity? Keep united in fellowship and in worship that focuses on God.
 This means that no government or people is above the Lord, and if anyone makes laws against Gods laws those laws will be brought to nothing by the Lord! Only God's law will stand.


Read Psalm 33:10-11 - The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing; He makes the planes of the people of no effect. The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the plans of His heart to all generations.
 - O lord, you have searched me and known me. This is a beautiful passage of how God knows each of His children and how the knowledge of this is too hard for human comprehension.Godâ€™s perfect knowledge of mankind means that He knows us personally!

, People fail, they get tired, and they give up on you when you need them without ever showing remorse when they disappoint you. On the other hand, God is faithful and ever aware of what we need, always willing and able to help us no matter what the need.


Read Psalm 146:1-10 verses 3-5 - does not put your trust in princes, nor in the sons of man, in whom there is no help. His spirit departs, he returns to his earth; in that very day his plans perish. Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God.

Some financial institutions will not allow you to cash checks drawn from other banks. You may have holds placed on deposited funds. Debit and ATM cards linked to your account may have transaction limits.;
, Use online banking to help track your account if your bank offers it. Remember that holds are often placed on second chance account transactions, so be careful not to forget about transactions that aren't immediately reflected in your available balance.

 They can offer advice and tips that are specific to your account. Some institutions offer upgrades to standard accounts after you have kept your second chance account in good standing for a period of time. Financial institution representatives can help you get a better idea of what steps you need to take to obtain an account with fewer restrictions.

 Put some fairly warm water in a tub and add some reassuring things inside the bath, such as bubbles and rubber duckies. Slowly lure your pup into the bath and with a soft sponge or cloth, rub gently on its ears, head, nose, stomach, back and bottom. Make sure the pup is making signals it is enjoying the bath, such as cute happy squeaks or playing with the bubbles and rubber duckies. Once you rinse off the pup, wrap it in its favourite blankie or towel and let it sleep in its crib.;
, The baby will feel uncomfortable with a stranger putting them in the water and will scream, cry and develop a lifetime fear of water. Instead, put some sunblock on the baby's nose, ears, back and tummy. Then put it in a comfy warm basket with some beach toys and take it to Crystal Sands.
 Take the newborn out of the basket and apply more sunblock. Then, put it in the soft sand let it play with beach toys. Then move beach toys and baby into damp sand until it gets used to water temp.
 Make sure it feels the water. If it cries, comfort it by rocking it or gently stroking its stomach/ears. Once it stops, continue the method until it feels comfortable in the water. Then take it out and re-apply sunblock. (This is essential because the baby may become sunburnt and it will be very painful)

, Then spread out your arms and call it enthusiastic until it jumps for you. Catch the newborn, then let it go. It will paddle with its tiny paws, and the floaties will stop it from sinking. If it starts to cry, cuddle it until it feels better.
 Make it paddle with its tiny paws to you, until it reaches you.
, Then, put it gently inside the basket and go home.

 Stress increases the production of glucocorticoid, which can lead to skin abnormalities.Two surefire ways to reduce stress are to get enough sleep and to exercise regularly.


Adults should get 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. Teens should get between 8.5 and 9.5 hours of sleep a night., A healthy diet might not automatically equal great skin, but it can definitely help.Follow these tips to reduce your susceptibility to acne:Don’t eat too many carbs. Healthy carbs are okay, but even then, eat them in moderation. Definitely avoid white flour, bread, cookies, sugary soda and other junk foods.
Minimize your dairy intake. It’s okay to have small amounts of cultured, whole milk dairy products containing natural probiotics (e.g. yogurt and kefir), but avoid cheese and ice cream as much as you can.
Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids. This include salmon, flax seeds, walnuts, and spinach, among other things.
Eat your fruits and veggies. These are natural sources of antioxidants, zinc, selenium, vitamin A and fiber, which can all help with acne.
Try to get as many of your vitamins and nutrients from food instead of supplements, as supplements are not always as effective. In fact, supplements can even be dangerous as they can lead you to take too much of a certain nutrient.
 Drinking enough water keeps your blood circulating and helps flush out internal toxins. There is little research to prove that toxins cause breakouts, but experts still recommend drinking plenty of water.To figure out how much water you should drink, divide your body weight in pounds in half. That’s how many ounces of water you should drink each day.
If you’re 150 pounds you should drink at least 75 ounces of water each day — more if you live in a hot climate or have an active lifestyle.
 Keeping the skin clear of sweat and oil will help reduce the chances of acne developing. If you have oily skin, you need to shower every day. You should also be sure to always wear clean clothes.If you can’t shower immediately after sweating, give your skin a swipe with some rubbing alcohol or other cleansing agent, and put on a clean, dry shirt.Wearing the same shirt twice could make you more likely to break out. Even if the shirt doesn’t smell bad or look dirty, it could still have old skin cells, oils, and bacteria in it from the last time you wore it.
 Dermatologists offer back facials and light peels that can help with acne. These can be done once a month until your skin clears up.If you have acne you might want to avoid exfoliating your skin, as this can cause the acne to spread to other areas of your back. The friction of exfoliation or scrubbing can also irritate the skin and cause acne to become worse.If your skin is just dry and a little dull, with few to no breakouts, you can exfoliate a few times a week to reveal smoother, glowing skin. Just be sure to follow it up with a moisturizer., This is only recommended for people who have severe acne. Be sure to do this only under the supervision of a medical professional.Remember that sun can cause enormous damage to the skin, including wrinkles, freckles, and skin cancer, so this really is only a last resort after you’ve tried everything else. Again, do this under the supervision of a medical professional.
In general, sun will actually make your skin worse, so protect your skin by using sunscreen (non-comedogenic if you have acne) whenever you’re out in the sun., If you are really struggling to get rid of your bacne (back acne), you may want to try seeing a doctor. There are different types of bacne, and not all of them can be treated in the same way.


A common type of acne that occurs on the back is called pityrosporum folliculitis. It has a different cause than the more well-known acne vulgaris, meaning it needs a different cure.Pityrosporum folliculitis is caused by yeast, so the way to treat it is to starve the yeast in your body, and use medications and skin treatments that target yeast specifically.

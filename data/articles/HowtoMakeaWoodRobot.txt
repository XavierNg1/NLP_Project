 Note that the parts are color coded for easy reference. Note that all units are in inches.;
, The body is made from a 4" long 2x4. Drill the holes at the locations shown. Note that the drawing shows through holes for simplicity. These four holes only need to be 1/2" deep from the sides.
 Cut the hip as shown. Again, the holes only need to be 1/2" deep.
 Use the excess from the 2x4 for making the head. You might want to pre-drill the holes for the facial features at this point.
  Cut 1/4" dowel to the lengths shown.
  Cut the 1x4 into 1.5” strips to be used for the legs and arms. Cut the parts as shown. A table saw was used for the Arm1 slot. A band saw was used for Arm2 and the hand. The holes were drilled with a drill press. A sander was used for the chamfers. Refer to video to see actual build.
 Place Arm2 into the Arm1 slot. Use the 3/4" dowel for the connection. Use 1" dowel to secure the hand. Repeat process to make two arm assemblies. See Video of the Arm and Leg Build Below.
  Same construction as the arm parts (see video).
 Same construction as the arm assembly (see video).
  Attach the hip to the body with a 1" long dowel.
 Align holes and use 1.25" long dowels to make the attachment.
 Align the holes and use 1.25" long dowels to make the attachment.
  Attach the head with a 1" long dowel.
 Use K'Nex parts for the eyes, eyebrows and mouth. Use wood screws to attach the pieces.

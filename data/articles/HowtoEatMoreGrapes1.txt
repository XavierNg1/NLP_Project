 A popular and easy way to increase the amount of grapes in your daily diet is to toss a few halved grapes on top of a lunch- or dinnertime salad. The sweet flavor and wet texture of the grapes will add a new sensation and flavor to any of your favorite salads. Try grapes on a salad with chicken for a pleasant flavor, or add halved grapes to any seafood or pasta salad.Grapes are especially popular in Mediterranean cuisine, and will go well with most Mediterranean salads. Try putting halved grapes on a salad with feta cheese, olives, and balsamic vinaigrette.
Fruits with a wet texture, like grapes, can reduce your need for dressing. Using less dressing means you reduce the overall calorie count on your salad.;
, Charcuterie plates make for a delicious and appealing pre-meal appetizer or mid-afternoon snack, but can be high in fats and low in fibers. To remedy this, and to add a sweet fruit flavor to the rich cheeses, cured meats, mustards, and crackers, add a handful of grapes to the plate.If you don’t want to take the time to put together a full charcuterie plate, you can make a simpler plate of cubed cheese, whole-wheat crackers, and grapes. Opt for a cheese with a sharper taste — like cheddar or gouda — to cut through the sweet flavor of the grapes.
 Grapes are a common breakfast food, and match well with the thick, grainy texture of French toast. Try preparing the meal with whole wheat bread, cinnamon sugar, egg whites, and a topping of sliced grapes to give your breakfast a rich flavor with plenty of protein. You can also top your toast with other healthy fruits, such as bananas, for a healthy and sweet breakfast. For the sake of variety, switch the type of grapes that you serve with your breakfast. Red grapes tend to be firmer and have a stronger flavor, while green grapes are a little larger and have a mellower flavor.

 Work with one specific part of your body at a time. Take a deep, slow breath through your nose as you squeeze the muscles for 5 seconds. The key is to tense the muscles as hard as you can without hurting yourself., Exhale slowly through your mouth as you quickly relax, letting all tension flow out of the muscles. Focus on the now relaxed muscles; they should be loose and limp., Don't move too fast. It will help to relax your body if you go slowly and deliberately, taking time between each tension-relaxation step. While relaxing, breathe slowly and evenly., Warmth is associated with relaxation. You can increase your level of relaxation by imagining the warm rays of the sun shining on the part of your body that you are focusing on. In addition, you can imagine yourself in a safe, relaxing face before or after you start your session (see Adding Guided Imagery below)., You can start with your head and move down, or with your feet and move up.


If a set of muscles is still tense, you may want to repeat the tense and relax cycle again before moving on to the next set of muscles.
You may also find it more effective to tense one side of the body then the other. For a quicker relaxation session, tense them both at the same time.

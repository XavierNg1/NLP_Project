 If you get out first, it will be harder to do the next step. Same goes for if you get out last. You want to get out in the middle so you can blend in easier.
 The teacher will pay attention to them when they get done with a set of exercises which will allow you enough time to look like you're done.
 He can't say you never did them when he didn't see you not doing them.
 For example: volleyball, capture the flag (just stand there and say you're playing defence), soccer (stand by the goal and, like in capture the flag, say you're playing defence.)

, Tell the person behind you that they can go ahead of you, in which case they will say "You sure?", and you can smile and say yes.

 These sharp metal objects could rub up against the pearl and cause scratches. Unclasped strands may also become tangled and cause your pearls getting horribly scratched.
 Other gems may scratch the surface of the pearls if they come into contact with them. Even other pearl pieces may have metal elements that could scratch the pearls on a separate piece, so store each pearl piece in its own compartment. If possible, use a small velvet drawstring bag and insert the pearl in there.
 Taking this extra precaution will ensure that nothing else scratches your pearls.
 Some plastics can emit a chemical that, over time, will cause your pearls to deteriorate. Airtight plastic bags can also cause vapor or sweat inside.
 Avoid hanging them high or hanging them at all.
 These dry conditions will dehydrate you pearls, causing them to develop small surface fractures. Air them at least every week or a month.
 This will help humidify the air, slowing down the dehydration process.
 Avoid jewelry boxes with windows that expose your jewelry to light. Long-term exposure to sunlight can cause your pearls to turn yellow.

, Create a new layer and name it "sketch." This is where your underdrawing will go.
 Try using light blue. This will be the base for your drawing and will not show up in the final product.
 This is where your uncolored line-art will go.
 The detail airbrush tool, when used at a small size, will create a much smoother outline than the pencil. Make sure that all the shapes are closed, which will make it easier to color. Clean up your outline with the eraser tool where needed.
 This is where having closed shapes is important, so that color only goes where you want it.
 Using the color picker tool, grab the color of any object. Use the color wheel to darken the color, lower the opacity and apply it using the airbrush tool. Pay attention to where the light is falling and the material that you are shading. Use the shadow color to create folds in fabric as well.
 Soften them up using the Blur Blender tool.
 Change the color to white and use the airbrush to apply highlights to the image in the same way you did shadows. Use the Blur Blender brush to soften the highlights.
 This example uses a light orange and brown airbrush at a low opacity to create a mottled effect on the skin. The Blur brush is also used to soften this effect.
 To do this, create a new layer and name it "background". Move this layer below the outline layer and fill it with a color (e.g. gray). For the shadow, use the airbrush tool, starting with a slightly darker color than the background and layering darker colors until you get to the center of the cast shadow.

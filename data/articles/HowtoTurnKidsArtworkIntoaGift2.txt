 Matting isn’t necessary to frame pictures, but it can add visual appeal, especially if the recipient uses mattes to frame their own wall art. If you’re fairly sure of where the recipient will hang it, choose a colored matte that will match that room’s color scheme and/or other matted artwork. Or, to play it safe, choose a neutral color like white or cream to border the picture within a traditional frame.
 If you’re presenting artwork in traditional picture frames, consider adding materials to display them as bonus gifts. Include nails, screws, or adhesive velcro hanging strips to mount them on the wall. Or splurge on a floating wall shelf so they can stand the frames up instead of hanging them., Just about everyone knows that the kitchen fridge has long been the go-to spot to hang kids’ artwork. If the recipient is a traditionalist, stick with tradition! Present your gift in a frame with magnetized backing so they can hang it from the fridge with an added touch of class., If the recipient loves gadgets, scan your artwork and load it to a digital frame that displays alternating images. These can store hundreds of images, so this is also a great idea if the recipient has limited wall- or shelf-space, or even if your kids are just that prolific. For an added touch, intersperse the artwork with behind-the-scenes photos of your family art project.

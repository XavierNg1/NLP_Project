 Many people assume that a sunburn or sun tan is only a threat when you feel the hot sun beating down on your skin, but this is not true. In fact, the white snow and ice reflect more UV rays than water, sand, and concrete, so exposed skin is at a higher risk during outdoor winter activities. Do not skip the sunscreen just because you’re not at the beach!

, UV ray exposure increases at higher altitudes, with altitudes of 9,000 - 10,000 feet having 35 - 45% more intense radiation exposure than at sea level.Between the increased UV exposure and the reflection of sun off of the snow and ice, your skin is doubly exposed to UV rays during outdoor winter activities.
 While sweat is the main reason for sunscreen wearing away during summer activities, being active outdoors in the winter means you have to contend with sweat, snow, and wind. To safeguard your skin during outdoor winter activities:


Choose a sunscreen that not only has UVA/UVB protection, but that also has a lot of moisturizer in it to combat windburn. Try to find a sunscreen with ingredients like lanolin or glycerin.
Don’t forget your lips! The skin on your lips is very delicate and prone to sunburn and windburn, so be sure to also wear a moisturizing lip balm with an SPF of 15 or higher.
When choosing protective winter clothes and gear, be sure to cover up as much skin as possible; wear a hat, gloves, balaclava or scarf for face and neck protection, and sunglasses or goggles that offer UV protection. A ski mask with UV protection is an especially prudent choice, as it covers much of the face.

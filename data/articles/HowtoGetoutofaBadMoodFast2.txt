 Spending time with friends in person can be a great way to improve your mood if you are feeling disconnected from others. Go to an early or late lunch, coffee, a movie, or dinner. If going out isn’t in your budget, go for a walk together or visit your local park and sit on the swings and talk.
 You may be in a bad mood because you feel isolated.Spending time by yourself and only communicating with others through screens can make you feel as though you are alone. Talking on the phone and having a 2-way conversation (particularly with a funny friend!) can improve your mood quickly.
 If you can’t get together with someone in person, try video chatting with someone who makes you happy. The video can make you feel as though you are really spending time with someone, and you can have a more engaged conversation than text chat offers.
 Try to find a pick-up basketball game or see if your company has a softball team. Playing a team sport can help improve your mood because it gives you an opportunity to socialize with other people while getting exercise., Scheduling regular face-to-face time with friends can help you avoid bad moods to begin with. Try building meaningful, recurring social time into your weekly schedule.

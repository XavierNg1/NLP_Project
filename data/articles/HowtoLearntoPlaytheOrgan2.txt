 Inquire at local churches, colleges, or music shops. Many colleges have undergraduate programs in applied organ, and music theory in general. You can also check organ-related periodicals for teachers. But the best way is to contact your local chapter of The American Guild of Organists, and search for a teacher through them. If you choose to talk to a local Church Organist, make sure that they are well-qualified to teach.When you make contact with a teacher, be sure to find out if you meet their minimum requirements to begin lessons (for example, ability to sight read and/or a certain level of experience on the piano).
 In order to learn the organ, you will need to practice outside of your lessons. An organ is a large and expensive instrument, so before you can begin serious organ study, you must ensure that you have access to a practice instrument. Speak to your instructor about the possibility of practicing at the studio, inquire at local churches, or obtain a small (or digital) organ for home.
 An introduction to organ book will help you to study the basics alongside what you learn during your lessons. Most music stores will carry such a book. Speak to your organ instructor about a book they recommends to work well alongside their teaching.
 Pedals are a unique aspect of organ playing, and having the proper footwear will help you develop efficient technique. Additionally, since you will only be wearing your organ shoes when sitting at the organ, they will not pick up dirt or grime which can damage the pedals.You can purchase them online for around sixty dollars.
Some instructors may require you to have proper organ shoes before you can play on their organ.

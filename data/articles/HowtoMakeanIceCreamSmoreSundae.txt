 For easier scooping, try ice cream that has slightly softened before using.


Serving bowls can also be used instead of sundae glasses.;
, Be sure the sauce fully covers the scoops of ice cream.
, Set them aside for the sundaes.
 Place the graham cracker pieces in the s'more sundaes. Garnish the sundaes with marshmallows and whipped cream, if desired. Enjoy!

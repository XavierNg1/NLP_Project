 Staying well-hydrated has big benefits for your health. Being well-hydrated will mean that your urine is more diluted which will help maintain kidney function and health. Some doctors recommend eight glasses a day, but in some cases more than this is recommended. Water helps to flush toxins and waste from the body so being hydrated aids the kidneys with this task, as well as regulating body temperature., Drinking water frequently throughout the day, rather than gulping down half a litre twice a day, could also contribute to improved kidney function. The kidneys keep fluid in your body regulated, so it is easier for them to do this if you drink a little and often., Drinking a lot of alcohol can have very serious negative consequences for your kidney functionality. One of the kidney’s main tasks is filtering out harmful substances from your blood. Alcohol is one of the harmful substances that the kidney deals with, and excessive alcohol can negatively impact on the kidney’s ability to do this.Alcohol also dehydrates you, and this has a negative impact on your kidneys just as staying well-hydrated has a positive one.

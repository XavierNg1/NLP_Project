 The proper Hebrew phrase which means Happy birthday is "yom hu'ledet sameach";
, The proper pronunciation of these words best described would be YOM= Yome rhyming it with the English word tome HU'LEDET= "WHO" "LEAD" (as in the metal) "ET" putting the emphasis on the Lead part.
 The word SAMEACH is the hard one cause it has that Jewish "ch" in it which does not exist in English. It is however similar to the "J" in Spanish and sounds like someone who is clearing their throat from phlegm.


"SAMEACH" is pronounced as "SA" as in the beginning of the words "sorry" "MAY" and then finally "ACH" with the a sounding like the "O" in the word on.

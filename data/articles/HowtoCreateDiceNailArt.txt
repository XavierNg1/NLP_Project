 Remove any old nail polish, file and buff nails, and trim cuticles. Apply a coat of base coat or ridge filler to create a long-lasting base for your polish.;
, White is a traditional dice color, but any opaque color will work. You could also make funky dice using bright or neon colours. Apply two coats of your base shade to all ten nails.
 Paint five dots in a dice pattern on your thumbnail, lowering the number of dots on each nail until you paint a single dot on the pinkie nail. Use the flat tip of the nail polish brush to press a circle of color on the nail for best results. Apply a second coat over each dot if needed.
 Reapply top coat every few days if you want to last for a long time.

 You want to soak the stones, keep them on a damp cloth to prevent slipping, and continually add water to the stone.


This strategy is only for a broken knife tip, not cracks or issues further down the knife.
 Again, put a damp towel on the table to prevent movement. You'll likely need your opposite hand to hold the stone still as you work.
 Hold the knife near the point and grind the flat, broken tip into a diagonal point. Remember to keep the stone wet, moving back and forth to get rid of the knicks and cracks.
 Now, run the knife back and forth vertically, like you would if you are cutting it. Keep the stone wet, and work the knife until you have a decent (but blunt!) curve to the tip of your knife.
 Do not do this in reverse -- you want to fix the tip, then sharpen the knife. This will bring the entire thing back to the right alignment and sharpness.

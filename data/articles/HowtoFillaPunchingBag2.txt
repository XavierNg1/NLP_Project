 Some people like to use sand for extra weight. It is not a good idea to have sand at the bottom of the bag as it can harden and can cause injury. Also, you don't want to pour the sand directly into the bag.
 This stops the sand bags sagging straight to the bottom and developing a rock-like feel.
 Carefully pour or scoop silver sand a plastic carrier bag, to about the size of a 1kg bag of sugar. Once you have the approximate size, tie the end of the bag and wrap the loose plastic around the sand bag. Use duct tape to tie it up.
 Once you have several sand bags, place them carefully in the middle of the punching bag, ensuring that they are totally surrounded by at least three inches of packed clothing/rags. The textiles should stop the bags from splitting inside the bag from the force of punches.
 If the bag is too heavy or you decide to make lighter in the future, just unzip the top of the bag and individually take the plastic bags of sand out until you get the desired weight.

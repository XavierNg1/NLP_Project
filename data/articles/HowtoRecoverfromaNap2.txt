 Wipe your face with a clean washcloth, or cup water in your hands. Rub the corners of your eyes to open them up. You can use warm or cold water, although cold water may be more refreshing: cool water has been shown to lower heart-rates and help you wake more quickly.


Take a shower, if you have time. Make sure to run plenty of water into your face.
Not only will washing your face make you feel less tired – it will make you look less tired. Wash your face thoroughly to rub out any lingering sleep-wrinkles.
 When you fall into a deep nap, your metabolism slows into a low-maintenance sleep-state. Drinking water will signal to your body that it's time to wake up. Fill a tall glass and drink it, slowly.
 If you're feeling especially groggy, try ingesting a caffeinated beverage—coffee, tea, energy drinks, etc.—to stimulate your mind and clear away the heavy-headed haze.


Avoid drinking caffeine if you're planning to fall back asleep anytime soon. Coffee affects everyone differently, but there's a good chance that one dose will keep you awake for hours to come.
Be aware that many caffeinated drinks have a dehydrating, diuretic effect. Drink coffee, if necessary, but be sure to also drink water.
 Spur your metabolism and settle your stomach. If you feel nauseous when you wake, it may help to put a bit of food into your system. Eat something light, digestible, and energy-rich: fruit and nuts are ideal.
 Read a book, read the paper, or go online. Work a crossword puzzle, play a video game, or watch an upbeat television program – anything that gets your brain working. If your mind is active and engaged, you'll find it more difficult to slip back into sleep.
 Put on a party playlist or a workout playlist – anything that pumps you up and makes you want to get moving.
 This should make you feel more awake and less groggy.

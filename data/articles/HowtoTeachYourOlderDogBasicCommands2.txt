 Many dogs will develop bad habits throughout their life, such as excessive barking or jumping up on people. These behaviours can often interrupt obedience training. A major part of training an older dog is actually correcting bad behaviours. One way to do this, is to put problem behaviours on cue. For example, teach your dog to bark and stop on command. Try this technique:Say the command “speak” then have a family member or friend ring the doorbell. This will likely cause your dog to bark.
To get your dog to stop barking, say the command “shush” and wave a treat in front of its nose. In order to sniff the treat, the dog will have to stop barking.
Once it has stopped barking praise the dog and give it the treat.
Repeat this training until they associate the commands “bark” and “shush” with treats.
 If your dog always jumps up on people when they enter the house or is aggressive at meal time, you will want to modify these behaviours. One way to do this is to stop the bad behaviour and replace it with a basic obedience command. For example, once your dog has learned to sit, you can tell them to sit when someone enters the house. They will not be able to jump up if they are sitting.


Alternatively, you could tell your dog to sit and stay while you get out their food. Then once you are ready say "ok" and let them eat.
These types of commands will help to solidify your position as the leader in the household.
 When changing behaviours in an older dog, consistency and patience are very important. To ensure that your dog gets the consistency they need, make sure that all members of the family are engaged in the training and using the same command words. For example, if you are saying “shush” to stop the dog from barking, but another family member says “quiet” this will confuse the dog and slow down the training.


Be patient. It will take a lot longer to change bad behaviours that have been accepted or reinforced for years.

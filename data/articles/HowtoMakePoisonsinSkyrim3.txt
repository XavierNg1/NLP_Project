 These are located all across Skyrim, with at least one in every village (usually located in the taverns).
 If the particular poison is grayed-out, it means you do not have the necessary items to make it. If it looks active, proceed to the next step.

 You will be asked to make sure you want to leave before you can actually move away from the lab.

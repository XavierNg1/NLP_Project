 In a clean, plastic spray bottle, combine ¼ cup (59 ml) of witch hazel, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vegetable glycerin, 2 teaspoons (10 g) of aloe vera gel, ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of colloidal silver, 5 drops of lavender essential oil, 3 drops of roman chamomile essential oil, 5 drops of sweet orange essential oil, 2 drops of carrot seed essential oil, and enough filtered water to fill the bottle. Shake the bottle gently to mix all of the ingredients.The colloidal silver is an optional ingredient, but it helps preserve the toner so it lasts longer and treats skin conditions such as acne, rosacea, and psoriasis.
Be sure to store the toner in a cool, dark spot. You can store it in the refrigerator to help it last longer, but it should be good for up to 6 months even at room temperature.
 When you’re ready to use the toner, wash your face with your usual facial cleanser. Next, gently mist the toner over your face and wait 2 to 3 minutes for your skin to absorb it before moving on to the next step in your skincare routine.If you prefer, you can spray the toner on a cotton pad or square, and wipe it over your entire face.
 After your skin has absorbed the toner, it’s important to hydrate your face. Use your usual moisturizer, and massage it into your skin to keep your skin smooth and supple.It’s all right if your skin is still slightly damp from the toner when you apply the moisturizer. That will help lock in the moisture.

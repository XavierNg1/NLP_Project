 If you only have one foot properly on the floor, you will be easier to knock over.;
, Not only will you have better balance, but there's a much better chance that you'll keep a little space between you and everyone else. Stand your ground.
 If you are at the very front, place your hands on the barrier and don't let go.
 It doesn't matter if they think you are a freak because of this next step. Shift one of your feet so that it is firmly in between theirs. This will make it easier for you to steady yourself if you are pushed.
 A simple way to ensure this, is by bending both of your arms out in front of you, and resting your wrists against the back of the person in front of you. This allows your chest room, and so nobody will be able to crush you.
 If you do, it is very likely that you will lose your balance, and an excited fan will knock you over. Make sure that, if you do go with the push, that you keep your arms out, and your feet flat on the floor.
, That way, you can jump higher, and be sure to land on the ground.
 Hold hands, or link arms with he people you went with, and walk to the exit.

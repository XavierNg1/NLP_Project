 This recipe is slightly more complex but is extra tasty, so give these a go if your dog is a picky eater.Ingredients should be available at your local natural food store. You will need:


½ cup of a fat of your choice, such as coconut oil, olive oil, or bacon fat
½ cup of chicken broth
⅓ cup coconut flour
1 ⅓ cup tapioca flour
½ tsp of sea salt
2 tablespoons of brewer's yeast
2 tablespoons of flaxseed meal

, Preheat the oven to 400F. Get out a small saucepan, a bowl, and a cookie sheet. Line the cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
 In a small saucepan, add the fat to the broth and bring it to a simmer. In a bowl, mix the tapioca and coconut flour, sea salt, brewers yeast and flax meal. Once the broth and oil mixture is simmering, take it off the heat and then stir it into the dry ingredients. Stir it with a wooden spoon to form a dough.
 Press or roll the dough out into a ¼ thick layer. Cut into small squares or use a cookie cutter to cut out individual treats.


Place the shapes onto the lined baking tray. Place the tray in the oven and cook for 15 minutes.
Allow to cool slowly before giving to your dog.

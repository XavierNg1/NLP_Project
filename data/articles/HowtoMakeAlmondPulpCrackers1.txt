, When you make a batch of almond milk, you will usually end up with about 1 cup (225 grams) of wet almond pulp. What you have leftover is just enough for this recipe.
 Stir everything together with a wooden spoon. You don't have to add the garlic, but it will lend the crackers a nice flavor. If you don't have any fresh herbs, use 2 teaspoons of dried herbs instead.


Great herbs to use include: chives, parsley, and rosemary. You can use just one type, or you can mix-and-match.
 Your pulp might be wet enough to mold. If it feels too dry, stir in some water, 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) at a time. Keep adding water until you can press the dough between your fingers.
 Cover your work surface with a sheet of parchment paper. Place the dough on top, then cover it with more parchment paper. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out until it is â…›-inch (0.32-centimeters) thick.


You can roll the dough out thinner. The thinner it is, the more crispy your crackers will turn out.
 Peel off the top sheet of parchment paper. Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to cut the dough into equal-sized squares. You should have enough dough to make about 20 crackers.


Don't worry about cutting the dough all the way through. You want to cut it deep enough so that you can easily break it later on, however.
 This will help the crackers bake more evenly. You can make as many or as few holes as you want. One prick of a fork for each cracker will be enough, however.
 Use the parchment paper to transfer the crackers onto a large baking sheet. Place the baking sheet into the oven. Let the crackers bake for 20 minutes.
 Gently break apart the crackers first. Use a spatula to flip them over. Place them back into the oven for another 15 to 20 minutes. They are ready when they turn golden and crispy.
 If you have any leftovers, store them in the fridge in an airtight container.

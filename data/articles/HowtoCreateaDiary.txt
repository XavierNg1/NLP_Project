 You'll need a pencil too, for the basic structure of your diary. Read the "Tips" section before you begin working on the diary.
 If you have someone to help you, better. If not though, that's okay. You have to apply a lot of compression to the sheets—consider holding them down with a textbook or dictionary.
 Spread a thick layer of glue on the side of the compressed sheets you think the spine of the diary will be. Don't worry if some glue spreads beneath some sheets. The important thing is that there is a lot of glue in the spine so the sheets won't be loose. The worst part is: you have to compress the sheets until the glue is dried, so the sheets won't be hanging out.
 You have to remember that you need at least a 3 centimeter (1.2 in) border to each side. These 3 centimeter (1.2 in) of normal paper will be glued on the first and last normal sheets of the inside of the book.
 Your diary will be more resistant now. These cardboard pieces, glued to the last and first page will be the cover.
 This will have to be measured previously with a ruler, to be neat. Right now, your book should look like a sad, uncoloured book, but still a book, with cover, sheets and spine.
 Start to decorate the cover of your diary! Cut old magazines and glue the cuttings to the cover of your diary! Draw in the cover, spell out your name or glue cute and fun stickers in it! It's all up to you!

, Put the date on the top of the page and start telling your feelings. Draw, glue, be imaginative! Specially: Have fun!

,, Write phrases, draw pictures, etc. Do the same on the back, but use less wording. Use markers, crayons, stickers, or colored pencil.
 You'll uncover the first page of the diary. Draw a circle in the middle of one page with crayons. Color outside the circle.


In the circle, write "This diary belongs to:" and then write your name under it.
, Do the same on the back.

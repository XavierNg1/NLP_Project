 Puppies are most open to new experiences between eight and twelve weeks of age. You should start getting it accustomed to using elevators during this time.In addition to elevator training, you should expose your puppy to as many new experiences as possible, like other animals, children, other people’s homes, and car rides.
If your dog is older, you can still use desensitization training to get rid of its fear of elevators.
 Schedule twenty minute training sessions during times when the fewest number of people will be riding the elevator. You don’t want to disrupt your neighbors’ daily activities, and you’ll want to keep training sessions as stress-free as possible.Try to observe the elevator and note the times of day with the lowest traffic. Morning and evening rushes, when people are coming and going to work, will be obvious occasions to avoid.
 When training your pup and whenever you expose it to a new experience, be sure to monitor your own body language. Try to control your breathing and heartbeat to project calmness, confidence, and positivity.Don’t panic if someone gets on or off the elevator, or if you encounter another dog. Say hello and be friendly. Your calm behavior will help cue your dog to keep its cool, regardless of age.
 Like your body language, holding the leash with some slack will let your dog know that it shouldn’t be reactive. Holding a leash too tightly or pulling it tells your dog that you’re in a stressful situation and it should be on guard.You don’t want to give your dog full reign or disregard the leash length. Shorten the length of the leash so you’ll have control if you need it, and be sure to keep it clear of the elevator’s moving parts.

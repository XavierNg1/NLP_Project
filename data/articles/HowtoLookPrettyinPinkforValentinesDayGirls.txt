 Start with a clean face. Apply a light foundation on your face and a concealer on your dark under eye circles and on any blemishes.;
,, Be sure not to use too much. You don't want to scare your date.
, A dab of liquid concealer woks great for this too.
 Add a darker pink shade in the crease.
,, If using lipstick, be sure to blot.
 Your skin tone should determine the shade of pink. Lighter skin should choose lighter pinks, and darker skin should choose darker pinks.
 A pair of cute sparkly jeans would look cute here, too.
 Your choice of tops and bottoms will determine your shoes. More casual clothes would look silly with spike high heels or pumps, so wear flats or ankle boots.If your outfit is more formal, go with more formal footwear, like heels. Pick shoe colors that complement your clothing.
 Again, just like with the footwear, your clothes will determine which accessories would not be appropriate. Some suggestions are scarves, necklaces, earrings, etc, but don't go crazy. Choose one or two accessories.


For instance, giant silver hoops with a big, showy, statement necklace would be too much. And if you're wearing that necklace, leave the scarf at home and wear a small, nice ring instead. You could go for pink and red jewelry. Accessories with roses on them are romantic. So have fun!

, A cute hairstyle is to leave your hair down and wear a pink rose head band in it. For this you could straighten or curl your hair. If using heated tools, be sure to use a heat protecting spray in your hair.


Another idea is to put your hair in a messy bun and add a flower clip.

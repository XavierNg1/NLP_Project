 The second chakra is associated with the flow of water. Just being around open bodies of water may be able to help you find a sense of peace to open up the second chakra. Don’t be afraid to engage with the water itself. Soak your toes, or splash the water on your face.Some places you might visit include:


The ocean
A river
A lake
A stream

, Bathing may be able to help you find a sense of peace. Immerse yourself in water. Give yourself some time to relax and reflect on your second chakra. You may even want to meditate while in the bath.You might try to:


Float in a pool or lake
Swim in the ocean
Take a long shower

, Adding essential oils to your bath may increase the effectiveness of your soak. Add about seven drops of essential oil to a carrier oil, such as jojoba oil or sweet almond oil, or a small amount of shampoo.Pour this mixture into your bath, and gently stir the water with your hand. Some good essential oils include:


Sandalwood
Patchouli
Orange
Rose
Ylang-ylang, Whether you are sitting by a lake or soaking in the shower, take a minute to reaffirm who you are. Repeat this affirmation to yourself. This may help restore a sense of peace and identity while allowing your second chakra to open.For example, you might say, “I am a strong, independent person with lots to give.”

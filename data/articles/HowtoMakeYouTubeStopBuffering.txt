 YouTube Center is a user-created add-on for your browser. Once you download it, you will have access to many more YouTube options, including the ability to stop automatic buffering, and to force videos to load completely instead of in small sections at a time.


User-created add-ons are not created by the company who makes the browser. YouTube Center should be safe, but add-ons do carry the risk of software bugs or malware.;
, Click one of the following links to download YouTube Center for your browser. After you open the file, the add-on should automatically install.



Download the add-on for Firefox.

Download it for Opera.

Download it for Safari.
 Visit YouTube and follow the instructions in the next section. If you do not see the new settings, try updating your browser. Usually, you can check for a browser update using the top menu, clicking the name of your browser (such as Firefox), then selecting Update or About (your browser name).
 As of September 2014, YouTube Center was not officially available for Chrome or Internet Explorer. However, it has been available in the past, and may become available again if those browsers approve the add-on. Search online for "YouTube Center" and the name of your browser. If it is still not available, you may need to use a different browser to access these settings.


Unofficial YouTube Center user scripts are sometimes available for these browsers if you also have an augmented browsing add-on such as Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey. However, these are not vetted by the browser store or the original YouTube Center creators, and may contain viruses or other malware.
 To access your new settings, navigate to the YouTube homepage. The settings are available while watching YouTube videos as well, but changed settings may not take effect until you reload the page.
 While on YouTube, click on the image of a cog wheel in the top right corner of the web page. This will open the YouTube Center settings.
 Find the left-hand column of menu items and click Player. This will take you to the buffer settings and related options.
 If your YouTube videos frequently pause and start buffering in the middle of watching them, try disabling "DASH Playback" by unchecking the box next to that name. DASH Playback divides the video into sections and loads them one at a time as you watch the video, which can result in interruptions if you do not have fast internet. With DASH Playback disabled, YouTube will buffer the entire video in advance, whether it is playing or paused.


YouTube does not allow 1080p or 480p while DASH playback is disabled.DASH stands for Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP., If you often open YouTube videos but do not watch them immediately, you might want to stop them buffering (loading) or playing until you are ready, so you can use your bandwidth for other activities. Check that the Player option is selected on the left-hand list, then click Auto-Play in the top row. Check any or all of the checkboxes to disable automatic buffering or automatic playing in various situations.


Checking "Prevent auto-play" will cause all YouTube videos to start out paused, and not play until you click them.
Checking "Prevent auto-buffering" will cause all YouTube videos to start out paused, and they will not start loading until you click play.
The remaining options apply the same effect, but only to certain videos. The "playlist" options prevent automatic playing of the next video in a playlist. The "tab" options prevent this for videos in a tab or window you are not looking at.

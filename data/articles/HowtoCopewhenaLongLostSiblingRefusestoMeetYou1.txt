 Being rejected by a sibling is a particularly painful experience. You likely envisioned that your long-lost sibling would be excited to meet you and that you would develop a loving relationship. Because of this, their refusal to meet with you hurts deeply. Along with disappointment, you will likely feel other emotions like sadness and anger. It is important that you allow yourself to express these emotions and take some time to grieve.For example, it is important that you take the time to cry and express your sorrow over your sibling's rejection. If you need to, take time off from work in order to express and process your emotions.
For some people, rejection might cause or exacerbate conditions such as depression or anxiety. Do not feel afraid to reach out to other loved ones, friends, or a mental health professional for help during this time.;
, The first assumption that many people make when facing rejection is that it is their fault. You will likely feel that your long-lost sibling’s refusal to meet with you is somehow your fault. However, it is important to remember that meeting a long-lost relative, particularly a sibling, will be emotionally difficult for everyone involved. Keep in mind that your sibling is not necessarily rejecting you. They are more likely having a difficult time with the idea that they have a long-lost sibling.Depending on the circumstances of your separation, there may be other factors that are preventing your long-lost sibling from connecting with you.
 Unlike other aspects of our lives, there is little that we as individuals can do to change the feelings and emotions of others. If your sibling does not want to meet with you, there is little that you can do about that. Therefore, it is important that you learn to accept and come to peace with your sibling’s decision.This is not something that you will come to overnight. It will take time and a lot of work before you are able to come to peace with your sibling’s refusal.

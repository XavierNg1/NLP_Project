 After you decide which kind of trip you would like to make, you can go ahead and reserve a charter through the company’s website. Channel Islands Aviation (CIA) advises interested parties make their reservations at least a week in advance. Refunds are only offered with 72 or more hours of notice.
 Among the things you’ll need to know:



Day trip travelers are permitted just three hours on the beach. A larger group can work out a deal with CIA to stay longer if interested, but arrangements must be made beforehand.

Campers are prohibited from bringing any hazardous materials along with them. This includes any devices used in creating a fire. CIA provides campers with propane once they reach the campsite, but visitors must provide their own stoves.

Animals and bicycles are not allowed. So leave the cat and the Schwinn at home.
 CIA suggests that passengers arrive 45 minutes prior to departure to make sure they have left themselves plenty of time.

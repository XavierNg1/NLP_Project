 Having the correct posture when serving is an important step to take. When serving underhand, your feet should be staggered with the opposite foot of your hitting arm forward. This will give you a good solid base as you serve.Most of your body weight should be on your back foot.
Your hips should be squared off with the net.
 Your hitting arm is the arm that will actually force the ball to go over the net, and itâ€™s usually your dominant arm. Use your other arm to hold the ball in front of your body to the side directly in front of your hitting arm.
 To hit the ball, you can make a fist with your hand and try to make contact with the flat part of your fist where your thumb and pointer finger meet. Swing your arm like a pendulum, backwards first and then forwards to hit the ball. You should make contact with the ball slightly below the center to make the ball travel out and up over the net.


Keep your eye on the ball where you want to make contact.
Transfer your weight from your back foot to your front foot as you hit the ball.
Try to drop your holding hand right before hitting the ball.
Let your hitting hand follow the ball as it is hit, making sure you follow through straight forward.
You can also hit the ball with the bottom of the palm of your hand.

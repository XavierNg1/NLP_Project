 On your way to beating the League, you'll encounter the Pokémon in the game that you can add to your ranks. Battles will also raise the level of your team, adding Pokémon to your collection through evolution.
 This is especially useful if your friend doesn’t want to give away a Pokémon specific to their version. By breeding it, you both can add to your pokédex.
 Note that some ultra-rare Pokémon are only found once a game and are impossible to breed. If your friend won't give up that kind of Pokémon, a brief trade will still work. If you return your friend's Pokémon, your pokédex will register the traded Pokémon as “caught.”

, Gotta Catch ‘em All Events are opportunities where you have better odds of adding certain rare Pokémon to your collection. A guidebook can be helpful, though many of the events are listed online.


Some online stores let you buy the tickets for the Pokémon (like eBay for example).
Examples of Pokémon you can get in events are Togepi, Eevee, Lapras, and Fossil Pokémon., Don't forget that some Pokémon might not be found in your version. But don't give up hope. Some Pokémon can only be found in areas still waiting for you to explore.

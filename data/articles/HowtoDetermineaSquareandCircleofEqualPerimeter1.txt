 The perimeter of square, with side s{\displaystyle s}, is 4s{\displaystyle 4s}. The circumference of a circle is 2π(r){\displaystyle 2\pi (r)} where r{\displaystyle r} is the radius. Therefore, you're dealing with 4s=2π(r){\displaystyle 4s=2\pi (r)}, and you can use these equations to help find your side or radius: s=π(r)2{\displaystyle s={\frac {\pi (r)}{2}}} and r=2(s)π{\displaystyle r={\frac {2(s)}{\pi }}}, depending on which method you use, below.

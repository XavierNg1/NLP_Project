 Benadryl can work in both humans and dogs as a mild sedative, which can calm dogs and alleviate the symptoms of anxiety. This can be helpful when taking anxious dogs on car rides, to the vet’s office, or in any other situation where dogs need to relax or sleep. Benadryl can also cut back on feelings of motion sickness in dogs.Do not use Benadryl for this purpose on a daily basis. If your dog frequently seems anxious or uncomfortable, take the dog to your vet and explain the recurring symptoms.
 Benadryl effectively works to counter most general allergy symptoms that dogs experience. (Of course, if you know that your dog reacts badly to specific allergens, keep the allergen away from the dog.) Administer Benadryl to sooth symptoms in your dog including:Itchiness or hives.
Swelling or inflammation from allergies.
Runny nose and eyes.
Allergy induced coughing or sneezing.
 While Benadryl successfully prevents mild to moderate allergic reactions, Benadryl will not be an adequate treatment if your dog experiences more serious symptoms. If your dog is experiencing difficulty breathing or has facial swelling, take the animal directly to a vet’s office.Veterinarians will have stronger medications at their disposal, and will be able to effectively treat a dog’s severe allergy symptoms.

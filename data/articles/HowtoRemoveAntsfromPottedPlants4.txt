 Ants detest coffee grounds and will avoid them if they are able. Sprinkle some of the grounds on the plantâ€™s soil. Spread a small circle of coffee grounds around the base of the plant., If you are uncomfortable using insecticides, especially if they have pets or children, there are several items in your kitchen cupboards that can kill or deter ants. These items include baking soda, pepper, cinnamon, chili powder, and peppermint. Encircle the base of your potted plant with a narrow ring of one of these products., If you prefer not to use chemicals to kill the ants, you may set up a non-toxic sticky trap. Surround your plant with contact paper instead of ant bait. As the ants try to cross the contact paper, they will get stuck.


Cut out a ring of contact paper that fits tightly around the base of your potted plant.
Separate the two layers and place the non-sticky side of the contact paper on the ground.
Set your plant directly in the center of the contact paper ring (on top of the sticky side).
Replace as needed.

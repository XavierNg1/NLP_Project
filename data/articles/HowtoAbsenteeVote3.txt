 If you are in-state when you complete your absentee ballot, you can usually deliver the ballot in person by going to the office of your local elections board.


Find the location of your local elections board by looking in your phone book or by tracking the information down online.
 Your absentee ballot should be mailed directly to your local elections department, regardless of whether you requested a ballot from the local department, state department, or FVAP.


Locate the address of your local elections board using a phone book or other directory. The information can also be found online.
 Many states permit you to send your absentee ballot by fax. While all states allow you to send the materials by mail, however, not all allow you to send the information by fax.


Verify that your state and local election departments allow you to send the ballot by fax by accessing the department websites or by contacting the departments by phone.
Note that your local election officials may need to contact you for further verification, information, or clarification after you fax the ballot to them.
 While it is not as common, some states and local governments allow you to submit absentee ballots by email. This option is usually available only if the ballot itself is on electronic form.


If you received an electronic ballot, follow the instructions on the ballot concerning how to turn the ballot back in. If no instructions are provided, contact the elections department you received the ballot from in order to find out specific details.

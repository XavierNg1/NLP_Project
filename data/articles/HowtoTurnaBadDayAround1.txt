 Life is full of twists, turns, and troublesome individuals that can turn a normal day into a bad one. Take a moment to pinpoint the problem, whether it’s a lack of sleep, an incorrigible employee, or a teenager who refuses to abide by the household rules.


Try taking five minutes to write about your feelings and what might be causing them.;
, Once you’ve identified the cause of your bad day, think through some simple steps you can take to address the problem. For example, if your bad day was caused by a fight with your teenager over breakfast because her soccer uniform wasn’t clean, try working with your family to set up a regular laundry schedule so it doesn’t happen again., Sometimes it’s not just a bad day, but a bad month or a bad year that you just can’t seem to shake. Try to identify ongoing problems and patterns in your life that might be contributing to your bad days. For example, if your career is causing you extreme stress it might be time to consider retooling with a different skill set and changing careers. If you fight with your significant every day, you should consider counseling or ending the relationship.
 When you’re having a bad day it can seem like everything is wrong in the world. Try writing down three things that are going well in your life. Practicing gratitude and optimism in the midst of a bad day will help put things into perspective., It’s important to remind yourself that a bad day is simply a bad day and does not mean that your entire world is falling apart. You will wake up tomorrow with a new day full of possibilities and the problems of today will be in your past.

 Add a pinch of real sea salt, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of magnesium oil, 15 drops of lavender essential oil, and 5 drops of frankincense essential oil with a large spoon. Carefully pour the salt and oil mixture into a glass spray bottle.Use a spray bottle that holds at least 2 ounces (59 ml).
 After you’ve placed the salt and oil mixture to the spray bottle, add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of magnesium oil. Measure the oil carefully because the deodorant spray may sting if it has too much magnesium oil.Low magnesium levels have been linked to body odor. Using the oil in the spray helps cut down on the odor even if you sweat a lot.
 Once you’ve added the magnesium oil, pour in enough witch hazel to fill the spray bottle completely. Next, gently shake it to ensure that all of the ingredients are completely mixed.Because the ingredients may separate, you should shake the deodorant spray before each use.
 When you’re ready to use the deodorant, lift your arms and lightly mist your underarm area. Give the spray 5 minutes or so to air dry before putting on your clothes.The deodorant spray will stay fresh for approximately 6 months.

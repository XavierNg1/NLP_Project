 A four-seam fastball is gripped with the index and middle fingers going perpendicular across the U-shaped seams. Your two fingers should touch the seams of the baseball in four places: the bottom of both fingers and the top.
 This will help create the cut in your fastball, as the last finger that touches the ball will be the middle finger.
 Your thumb and your top fingers may not be exactly diametrically opposed, but they should be pretty comfortable.

When said as a phrase, au revoir is usually translated directly to "goodbye." The phrase translates more closely to "to see again" or "to meet again," however.

Au translates into "to." Revoir translates into see again, meet again, or revise.

Pronounce au revoir as oh ruh-vwah.



Avoid using salut in formal settings.
Also note that salut can be used to greet someone as well as saying farewell.
The term has a variety of translations, including "greeting," "salute," and "all the best."
Pronounce salut as sah-lyoo.



Use "adieu" sparingly; this phrase means "goodbye forever" and is generally only used when you will never see this person again in your life. This phrase can also be said upon your last visit with someone who's dying.

A translates into “to,” and Dieu means “God.” Translated more literally, this phrase says “to God” and is the same thing as saying “go with God” or “Godspeed.”
A rough pronunciation of adieu would be ah-dyoo ("oo" as in "book")

Check your local YMCA and yoga studios in your area.
Join a beginner's class if you cannot find a class specifically designed for your age group.
Talk to friends who are over 50 and willing to try yoga. If you have enough people who want to take a class, you might convince an instructor to teach a regular class to your group.
 While a class will help you understand the basics and give you the benefit of an in-person teacher, books and DVDs can help you do yoga at home.
 You will want to wear comfortable clothing in a breathable fabric for yoga.
 Some places will provide you with mat, but get one of your own, especially if you plan to do yoga at home.
 Study the way the instructor does each pose before you try it yourself.


Go slowly as you move from one pose to another as well. Do not make any sudden movements that might cause you to pull a muscle or harm yourself.
Respect your physical limits. Do not force yourself into a pose, and if something is too complicated, modify the pose or spend the time stretching.
 When you are over 50, your balance can be challenged. Focus on the ground or straight ahead when you can.
 Most people over 50 years of age struggle with their ankles, backs, hamstrings and hips.
 Take deep breaths through your entire body and release your breath when your instructor tells you to.


Take your breathing lessons from yoga into your daily life. People 50 and older tend to breathe shallowly. Deep and purposeful breathing is better for your health and circulation.
 Keeping yourself calm while you practice yoga is good for your mental health, thought clarity and heart.
 People who start yoga after 50 enjoy better sleep habits, more flexibility and energy, less chronic pain and better movement.

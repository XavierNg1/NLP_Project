 Most major cable providers release apps that you can download which allow you to watch live TV directly on your device. These apps are free but require you to have an account with the cable provider.
 You will need to have created an account through your cable provider's website in order to log in to the app. You can create accounts from each cable provider's homepage.


You will need your account number in order to create an account.
 The capabilities your app has varies from provider to provider. Some provide a limited number of live streaming channels, while others only allow you to watch recorded video.


Streaming video takes a lot of data, so make sure that you are on a wireless connection if you have a limited data plan.

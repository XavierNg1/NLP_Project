It's not cool to act braggy, smug, or superior because of your membership! Remember to be kind and nice to other jammers, no matter what status are them in!

Of course that, with a membership, there are more ways for you to have fun in-game - and you're supporting AJ! But you, non member, are still a jammer just like everyone else! Don't feel inferior because you aren't a member, you can still play and have fun - and AJ is already happy to have you as a fellow Animal Jammer! If people don't want to be your buddy/ignore you just because you are a non member, forget about them them and jam on! That almost certainly means they are not good people, so try to avoid them!

If your parents cannot give you one, don't be sad. They surely have a reason for that, so don't quit Animal Jam because of it!
Here you go a few tips you can follow: Ask for a membership as a christmas or birthday present, make an effort to get good grades/keep on having good grades at school and, principally, be a nice, gentle and generous son/daughter are ways for you to get a membership! You could also try to make a little money by yourself so you can buy it, still with your parents' permission of course, if you're mature enough to.

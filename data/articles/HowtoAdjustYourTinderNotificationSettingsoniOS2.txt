 The icon is a set of dark grey gears on a light grey background. Then, tap "Notifications" (iOS 8) or "Notification Center" (iOS 7).
 Click on it.
 At the top of the page, you can choose whether to receive alerts by Banners, Alerts, or none at all.


Banners will flash across the top of the screen when you are using your phone, and show up on your lock screen when you aren’t. They require no action from the user.
Alerts pop up in the middle of the screen, and require the user to click a button to clear the notification.
 This bubble will disappear when there are no new notifications.
 If this is turned on, your device will emit a notification sound upon receiving new notifications (unless your device is on silent).
 If you turn this setting on, you can also decide how many alerts to display at once.
 This may be important if you don’t want others to know that you are using Tinder. If you turn this off, you will only get notifications while you are actively using your device.

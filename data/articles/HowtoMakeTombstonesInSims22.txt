 If your Sim is in a building without a method of escape, and the building burns down, they will die, giving you a tombstone.
 Swimming in a pool in which you have deleted the ladders will drown your sim.
 If a Sim with no Mechanical points attempts to repair an appliance, the result is often fatal.
 This is the longest and slowest method. You just prevent your sim from obtaining any food.

 This can help you earn between 4,000 and 10,000 coins. Season games take longer but earn you a higher number of coins.
 Sell everything on your bench for a reasonable price; don't sell things for too low either. Selling a whole team (or parts of it) is a good way to earn coins fast because you can always buy a player back, but it will only pay off if you know how to use those coins to earn profit., Search for Bronze players and have the "Buy Now" price at 101-150 coins. The lower you can find them the better. Try to purchase 60-70 players., Scroll down and find the "Bronze Player Trade-In". Once you find that set, put all useless Bronze players in that set and you will be rewarded a 2-Trophy pack., Make sure to have a look at the current prices on the auction house and adjust as needed.

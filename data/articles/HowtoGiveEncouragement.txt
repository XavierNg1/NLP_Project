 In order to provide effective words of encouragement, you should first determine what the difficulty is. Generalities suggesting that they can "work through it" are much less helpful than specifically addressing the issue that is holding them back.;
, Because you want them to be more at ease with the prospect of doing something, you should indicate confidence in their abilities and focus on what can be accomplished and what potential benefits may be reaped by boldly taking action. Remind them of their previous accomplishments and what they gained because of their efforts.
 Encouragement is most effective when you say things that you really mean. Undue flattery may produce unrealistic expectations and ultimately cause more harm than good. Honestly expressing your desire for the person to succeed and your expectation that the experience will be good for them can help motivate them to take action.
 Assure them that their worth is not determined by the outcome of any given endeavor. Everyone experiences both success and failure in various ways throughout life; it is important to learn from both.

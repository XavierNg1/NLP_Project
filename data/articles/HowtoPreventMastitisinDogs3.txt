 When you have a dog who has just given birth, you should watch for the symptoms of mastitis. Mastitis can be a mild condition you can treat at home, but it can also turn into a severe condition that can lead to death. Common symptoms of mastitis include:Pus or bloody discharge from the teats
Red, swollen, warm, hard, or painful mammary glands
Lethargy or depression
Loss of appetite or dehydration
Fever
Reluctance to nurse or neglect of the puppies
Aggressive behavior
Failure of puppies to thrive or grow
Crying or whining from puppies

, If you believe your dog has mastitis, you should take them to the vet. This is important because mastitis can move quickly and turn severe, which may lead to death. The vet can properly diagnose mastitis by performing a physical exam and running tests.The vet may be able to diagnose mastitis from only a physical exam. They may also take a bacterial culture, milk sample, or do a needle aspiration of the mammary tissue to analyze.
 Mastitis has a good prognosis, especially if it is caught early. The most common treatment for mastitis is antibiotics to eliminate the bacteria. If the mastitis is severe, the dog may need to have the mammary glands surgically lanced and drained, or they may have to have them removed.Applying a warm compress to the mammary glands can help reduce swelling and help the milk flow normally.

 Look for a moisturizing shampoo, or one for damaged hair. Keep an eye out for shampoos with natural ingredients like jojoba oil.Natural ingredients that moisturize will work best to treat your hair. Some chemicals can make your hair feel smoother, but will really cause further damage to the follicle.
Only wash your hair with shampoo near the scalp.;
, Use a conditioner to help repair damaged hair at the tips. Apply the conditioner to wet hair at the tips. Do not rinse. Use a blow dryer on high to dry the strands with the conditioner still in. The heat will let the conditioner penetrate deep into the hair.


Look for conditioner with natural, plant-derived ingredients such as keratin.
 Putting a hair mask on twice a week can help restore your hair. Apply the mask and leave it on for an hour. Use a shower cap to keep the hair from drying too quickly and let the mask have a chance to really soak into the hair.


Look for products that are packed with lots of natural ingredients like palm oil. Avoid anything that contains silicone.
 A split end serum won't permanently repair your hair, but it can temporarily mend damaged tips and fuse them back together so they look better.Just apply a small dollop while your hair is damp as part of your every day routine.


As an alternative, try applying a bit of coconut oil to split ends to achieve a similar result.

 Cut a lemon in half, and use a lemon juicer to squeeze the juice. Use a strainer placed over your glass to catch any pulp and seeds. Discard the pulp and seeds when you are done.


This method makes a great science experiment because the acid in the lemon juice reacts with the baking soda and makes it fizz., You should now have 1 part water and 1 part lemon juice in your glass.
 Start with 1 teaspoon of sugar. Stir it to help it dissolve and give your drink a taste. If it is not sweet enough, add another teaspoon of sugar. Now, all you've got to do is add the fizz!


If you have simple syrup, you can use that instead. It will mix in a lot easier!
Avoid adding too much sugar, or it won't dissolve. If you start to see little grains at the bottom of your glass, you are using too much!

, If this is for a science experiment, consider adding it in Â½ teaspoon at a time so that you can see the reaction., You can drink it as is or add some ice to it. As an optional step, you can add a few mint leaves to the beverage. Enjoy!

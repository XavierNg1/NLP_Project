 While going with the black base coat against white web may be traditional, consider getting funky by using a neon base color and a contrasting web color.
 You may get away with only one coat for this nail as the star is the webbing.
 For webs coming out of the side of your nail, draw two wavy circles coming from one side. Create the circle waves, like you would if you were to draw a wavy ocean pattern with peaks and valleys. While the circle waves are still wet, use your nail art striper brush or a toothpick and lightly drag white polish down the side, middle and end of the circles.

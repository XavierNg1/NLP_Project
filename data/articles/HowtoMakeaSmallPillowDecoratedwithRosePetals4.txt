Fold over one side of each of the two smaller pieces of fabric.
Right side of the flower panel facing upward, place the two folded pieces of fabric on top of the flower panel. Align the four sides of the fabric pieces so that the folded places are positioned in the middle.
Sew a seam around the edges of all the pieces of the fabric, joining the panels together. Leave the middle part at the folds open to create space for the zipper, buttons or Velcro. Ensure that the corners of the pillow's panels are neat.
 This will allow you to open the pillow and remove the cover for easy cleaning. Then turn the pillow cover right side out. Stuff a small pillow insert or batting/stuffing inside. Done––you should now have a stunning small rose pillow with many individual petals.

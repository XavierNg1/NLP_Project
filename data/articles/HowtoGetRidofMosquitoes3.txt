 Mosquitoes are often attracted to water, especially standing water. Examples of mosquito breeding grounds include old tires, driveway puddles, clogged gutters, unfiltered fish ponds, empty flowerpots, and any item that can hold water for more than a few days at a time.


Use a push broom to distribute the water for small puddles on hard surfaces. Use a siphon pump for larger puddles.
If you're inundated by mosquitoes due to standing water from street curbs, drainage ditches or other pools you cannot control, call the responsible public authority to explain that you believe the water has become a mosquito breeding source.
If it is not possible to remove particular water source, place some Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (BTI) dunks/granules into the water. BTI is a species of bacteria that functions as a larvicide and will kill mosquito larvae for as long as a month, in addition to being safe and non-toxic to children/pets., If you have a koi pond or swimming pool that doesn't see much use, it may become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Do yourself and your neighbors a favor by doing regular maintenance to keep the water fresh and flowing.Cut back vegetation from around your pond or other water features.
If you have a birdbath or another small source of water, change the water frequently or agitate it so mosquitoes won't lay eggs there.
Treat your pool with the proper chemicals to make it uninhabitable for mosquitoes.
 Too much grass and shrubbery can create breeding and hiding grounds for mosquitoes. Be sure to regularly mow your lawn and use hedge trimmers to cut back shrubs and other vegetation.

 There are many Pokémon in RU, some more viable than others. Either decide to build your team around 1 Pokémon, or use a certain role (Different roles are a good thing to use when actually building the team around 1 Pokémon).;
, However, after you have decided your first Pokémon, you can always make a core (pair which helps each other by making up for the other's weaknesses) between this and your second Pokémon.
 The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth Pokémon apply the same. However, you should probably apply a lead (a Pokémon that sets up entry hazards/or is intended to provide support for certain Pokémon in the first turn), an anti-lead (Pokémon that intends to stop lead Pokémon from doing their "job"), and a wall (very defensive, can take hits) or a tank (similar, but can dish out more damage) as well as a hard hitter.
 Once you have six Pokémon, look at any glaring weaknesses your team has (type disadvantages, getting walled by a certain Pokémon, getting defeated by a certain Pokémon). Then, find ways to get past said weaknesses. This includes replacing Pokémon and putting necessary moves on certain Pokémon to get past weaknesses.
 Then start laddering and battling!

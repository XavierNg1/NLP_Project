 The people of Dauntless always dress in black. Men most often wear black pants and form-fitting shirts. Women are most often seen wearing black skin-tight shirts and pants, tights, or dresses, with their hair down. They wear black shoes that are comfortable and that they are able to run in (preferably sneakers or combat boots). They may also wear dark eyeliner, makeup, or dye their hair unusual colors. If their hair is not dyed, it still often looks unique in some way. Most members also have tattoos.;
, As the warrior faction, the Dauntless maintain great physical health and strength. So, in your free time you may like to start running, lifting weights or doing other physical activities you enjoy.
 Take some risks in your everyday life. Tris herself said: "I never thought I would need bravery in the small moments of life. I do."

, Dauntless believe that they should protect those who cannot defend themselves.
 Put yourself in situations that are out of your comfort zone. Learn what your fears are (perhaps write them down) and then tackle them in safe environments when you can.
 This applies to a range of life situations, such as in relationships, friendships and personal opportunities.
 The Dauntless don't just use bold words, they take action! Get out there and, oh, I don't know, save a life or something?

, When necessary, the Dauntless are not afraid to break peace in order to bring justice.
 Dauntless believe that fear and cowardice are the reasons for the world's problems today!

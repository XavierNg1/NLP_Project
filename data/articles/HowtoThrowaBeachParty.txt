 What beach will it be at? Check out all your local beaches and look for the best beach. Ideal beaches should be fairly close, free of sticks and driftwood (Unless you plan to have a bonfire)and clean water. Go to the beach yourself and plan out where your party will be. Remember to get a permit if it's going to be a huge party.;
, Evening, Noon or Morning? This affects your catering as well, so make sure it's a time people wouldn't have eaten yet.
 Are your grandparents or teenagers coming? Arrange with friends if there are children are coming? If kids are coming, make sure the party isn't too late.
 Fresh, juicy fruits like watermelon and mango and barbecues are the best way to go for a beach. Make sure you have lots of drinks, chips, and dips.
 The possibilities are endless. Palm trees, surfboards, beach balls, and waves are just a few ideas. Be creative!

,, Will it be a bring your own, yourself making the food or professional catering?

, Don't forget anything.

 Begin by brushing your hair thoroughly. Knots and tangles make braiding a lot harder than it should be.;
, Since the side braid look is asymmetrical and on the side of your head, part it to one side. It does not matter if it's the right or the left. The braid is not going to be straight down the back of your head.









If you’re going for a romantic look, allow the part to be messy. If you want to go for something more fun, try a zig-zag part.
 If your part is off to one side, make sure that the hair is on the side farthest from the part. Make sure the shortest pieces aren't too short to braid.









If the part is on the right side, make sure the hair is on the left side. If the part is on the left side, make sure the hair is on the right side.
If your hair is medium length and too short for one side braid, two side braids (i.e. pigtails) might work better. Or try one of these side braids just around the hairline.
 Take the hair into your hands and divide into three even sections.


The area underneath your ear will be the anchor point for your braid, so don’t move the braid around once you get started.
 Starting underneath your ear, braid as you normally would. Grab one of the outer sections and cross it over to the middle, then grab the outer section on the opposite side and pull it to the middle.Repeat, cycling through all three strands over and over again.
 It’s best to stop before strands of your hair become so short that they begin falling out of the sides of your braid.
 When finished, place an elastic band around the end of the braid. Arrange any wisps of hair that are hanging out. Spray with hair spray if desired.


If you want a cleaner look, use spray or pins to secure wisps. If you want a messier, softer look, leave the wisps.
 Letting a few strands frame your face will soften the look, so if you have long side-swept bangs or want a few tendrils to curl out around your neck, separate out those pieces now.

 Try to think of a list of about 10 for your testing part, like maybe troll, dragon, goblin, orc archer, orc soldier, orc wizard, ogre and other things like that., Maybe an ogre attacks for 3, so put down on its description ‘Damage:3’ (without the quotation marks), and do that for all of the stats that you can come up with (most likely attack, defense, effects, and other things like that, or just all of the stats that the player will have),, Maybe fireball, bite, throw weapon or some other abilities., The more skills and hp they have, the harder they are to make.

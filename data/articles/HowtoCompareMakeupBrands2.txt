 ApplicationÂ is an important feature when it comes to makeup; the application and overall feel of the product can help you decide whether or not the brand is of good quality. The product should have easy application and should not feel uncomfortable on your skin.
 The colour of the product should be true to the packaging or what it looks like on the outside of the packaging. If the colour is not to your liking, you should attempt to get a refund. A good brand will always accept constructive criticism and a refund.
 Depending on the type of product you choose, your product should be true to its title. If the product promises a creamy finish, the finish should be creamy and smooth. If the product promises a matte finish, you should receive zero (or very minimal) shine or shimmer. The product should not set in fine lines into your skin and should have a comfortable wear.
 The appearance of the product from the outside doesn't seem to worry many, but the way a product is packaged can affect the overall result and performance of the product. If you are paying an expensive fee for the product you are purchasing, then you should receive a container that is appealing. A good example of high quality packaging includes MAC lipsticks and Gerard Cosmetics lipsticks; these brands are high in quality but pricey too.
 What the product claims to do should be done. Products constantly offer things such as "24 hour lasting"; if the product claims to do so, it is expected that it will be true to its promise. The product promise of a brand can assist you in comparing that particular brand to another "24 hour lasting" product of a different brand. For example, it can happen that during advertisements, lip glosses are constantly portrayed as highly pigmented when in fact, they're not very opaque and quite sheer.

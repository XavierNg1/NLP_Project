 Learn about your goal by doing an Internet search on your goal. Chances are that other people have had similar goals and have since figured out how to accomplish it. Also find books or magazine articles talking about the different ways other people have accomplished similar goals.For example, if your goal is to get into a graduate program, look into books like “Strategies for Getting into Graduate School” or “Applying to Graduate School.”


Go to your favorite local bookstore or library, and ask someone at the reference section to help you find books relating to your goal.
 Read success stories about people who have accomplished similar goals. These stories are often inspiring and motivating, and will show you that it only takes focus and determination to reach your goal.


In your Internet search bar, type in your goal and search for specific people who have accomplished the same or a similar goal. Knowing that others have successfully accomplished a goal will motivate you to keep going.
You can also post inspirational quotes by people who have accomplished major goals in their life around your room or on your bathroom mirror as well.
 Surround yourself with people who have goals and plans; people who are going somewhere with their lives and have high aspirations. At the same time, try to stay away from toxic people; people who complain and whine all the time.Join a club or a community group with individuals who have similar intentions as you: to realize their goals.
Be willing to let go of old friends. For the majority of people, this is the hardest part. But it is a necessary step if your friends are negative or if they just don’t inspire you.

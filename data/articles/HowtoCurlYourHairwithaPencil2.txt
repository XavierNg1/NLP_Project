 Run the brush or comb through your hair, ensuring that there are no tangles. Make your way through each part of your hair, pulling from the roots to the tips of your hair.Use a wide-toothed comb for curly hair and a fine-toothed comb for straight hair.
 As you are twisting around the pencil, bring your section of hair closer to one end of the pencil to bunch the hair together. Make sure that you cannot see the pencil under your hair, but do not overlap the hair over each twist. This allows for a more natural looking curl that continues from the top to bottom. It will also help you to flat-iron your hair, not the pencil.
 Make sure that your iron is not too hot as it can burn your hair. For fine and chemically treated hair, use a low heat setting below 200 degrees. For thicker or coarse hair, set it to 200-300 degrees. Never go above 400 degrees.Wait about 3-5 seconds for each twist, gently pressing the hair on the pencil. Be careful not to press your fingers with the hot iron. After ironing, hold the twist for about 10 seconds. For extra hold, spritz hairspray when holding the coiled hair. , If you feel that they are too tight (almost spring-like), run your fingers through your curls once or twice. Do not continue to comb through your hair as the curls will not stay. After you have achieved the look you want, continue on to seal in your style.
 Hold the hairspray at least 12-14 inches away from your hair. Choose a medium-hold hairspray to style curls to stay all day.Enjoy your bouncy curls!

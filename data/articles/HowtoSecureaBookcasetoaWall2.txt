 Move the bookcase out of the way.
 Use a yardstick to mark the center of the stud with a vertical line.
 If this is impossible, you can attach your brackets at the top, into a center stud.
 For tall shelves, this is the best place to secure a bookcase into a stud because it is the least noticeable place.
 You can also use door chain latches in place of L brackets if you want to move the shelf regularly. Install the chain on the wall and the slide on the top of the shelf.,, Drill the other side of the L bracket into the wall with washers and three-inch wood screws. Drill until the screw head is almost even with the bracket, but avoid stripping the screw.


If you canâ€™t find a stud, you should install wall anchors before you drive screws into drywall or masonry. Drill a pilot hole into the wall and push the wall anchor in. Then, align the brackets and drill with three-inch screws.
 Place an L bracket between the wall and the side of your shelf, where it will hit a stud. Repeat the same procedure on either side of the shelf.

 This may include web pages, email messages, and photo applications.If you cannot zoom onto a certain file or page that particular application may not support the zoom function. If you want to zoom into a third-party app, try taking a screenshot of the page and then zooming in on the screenshot image.
 Place your thumb and pointer finger at opposing points of the screen as if preparing to pinch a cheek., Note that the faster you spread your fingers, the more quickly the screen will zoom.
 Reverse the motion of zooming in. Gently "pinch" your fingers towards each other while keeping contact with the screen.
 Though the zoom distance is pre-set, this can often be a handy shortcut for quickly glancing at something in detail, and can sometimes be repeated to zoom deeper into high-detail objects like maps. This technique is a bit more difficult to get used to, but very useful when mastered. The double-tap behaves differently on pictures than on text:


Repeated double-taps on a picture may zoom in until a set point, and then begin to zoom back out. Double-taps may also just zoom in, then stop zooming when a threshold is reached.
A double-tap will fit text to screen, in order to allow an optimal reading comfort.

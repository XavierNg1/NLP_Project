 Potato flakes are pre-packaged dried mashed potatoes, and you can add them as a thickener to country-style sauces and rich gravies, stews, and soups. Avoid this method with clear sauces or sauces with delicate flavors.


This is a quick-fix thickening method, so the potato flake proportions are more to taste than an exact measurement.
 As your sauce simmers, add potato flakes a little at a time. Stir to incorporate, giving each addition time to thicken. Add more potato flakes as needed until the desired consistency is reached.


Adding foods like potatoes, pasta, or oats to a rich and savory sauce will also naturally thicken the sauce because of the starch present in the food.
 Before serving, taste your sauce and adjust the herbs and spices if the potato flakes have altered the flavor of the sauce.

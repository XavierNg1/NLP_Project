 Pick a reading spot that you know will be quiet and have the least amount of distractions. At home, this might be your bedroom or a room upstairs, away from shared areas like the kitchen or living room. At school, you may read in the quiet area of the library or in a quiet corner of the study hall.Choose an area that has thick walls and a door or a partition. This will help to block out noise and other sounds that could distract you from your reading.;
, If you know there is going to be noise where you are reading, wear noise cancelling headphones or ear plugs. Close all doors to keep out noise. This will help you stay focused on the text.

You should also turn off your cellphone and your wifi. This way, you are not distracted by social media or text messages.
 Let those around you know that you are trying to focus on reading. Put up a Do Not Disturb sign on your door. Ask others around you to stay away from your room or area so you can try to absorb the text in peace.

You may instruct others to leave you alone for a set period of time, such as 30 minutes or 1 hour. This way, you are assured of some peace and quiet for a set period of time so you can focus on the text.

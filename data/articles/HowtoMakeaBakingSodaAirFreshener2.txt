 Add ½ cup (90 g) of baking soda and 15 to 25 drops of an essential oil to a small glass canning jar. Use a spoon to carefully stir the two together until they’re fully combined.If you want a stronger scent for your air freshener, you can mix in more of the essential oil.
 Once the baking soda and essential oil are mixed, place the lid and a paper or cloth covering over the jar. Twist the lid well to ensure that the covering is securely in place.It’s important to use a jar covering made of paper or cloth, such as cheesecloth, cotton, or linen. These materials will keep the baking soda from spilling out but still allow the scent out of the jar. Don’t use a metal or plastic covering that will block the baking soda from absorbing odors and the essential oils from giving off their scent.
 When the lid and covering are secure on the jar, the air freshener is ready to go. Set it out on a table or countertop wherever you want to freshen the air. The kitchen and bathroom are ideal locations, but you also can place it in your bedroom, living room, or family room.If the air freshener seems to have lost its scent, shake the jar. That will redistribute and freshen the scent.

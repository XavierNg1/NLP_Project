 If you want to keep cats out of certain areas of your yard, but donâ€™t mind them being in other areas, then try making a cat-friendly area. Cats will be attracted to areas covered by certain plants, and hopefully leave the rest of your yard alone. Create a small plot and grow one or more of the following non-toxic plants in it:Catnip (Nepeta cataria)
Catmint (Nepeta mussinii)
Cat thyme (Teucrium marum)
Valerian (Valeriana officinalis)
Spider-plant (Chlorophytum comosum), Cats do not like certain plants, and will stay away from them. Try cultivating one or more of these plants in areas of your yard that you do not want cats using as a litter box:Lavender
Rue
Geranium
Absinthe
Lemon thyme
Thorny roses

, You can create an alternative outdoor litter box for cats by using a new or old sandbox that is at least as big as a large litter box.Fill it with soft, fine-grained sand (this can be bought by the bag at hardware and home supply stores), which cats find especially attractive. With luck, cats will be drawn to the sandbox and use it much as they would a litterbox.


Make sure to scoop the sandbox regularly; if it gets too full, cats may return to using your yard.
Keep children away from the cat sandbox, and make sure they understand not to play in it.

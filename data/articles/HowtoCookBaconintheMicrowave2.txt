 In this method, the bacon is draped over the side of the bowl. As it cooks, grease runs down into the bowl and onto the plate below for easy cleanup.
 Place as many slices of bacon as you want around the rim of the bowl. If you don't want the bacon sticking together, keep gaps between the pieces; otherwise, don't worry about it.
 Place the bacon-draped bowl into the microwave. Cook the bacon on the highest setting for about 90 seconds per slice. If you're cooking a full pound of bacon, it may take up to 15 minutes.









To avoid splattering the microwave with grease, you can lightly cover the bacon with a few paper towels.
Rotate the microwave plate at 10 minutes. This will ensure even cooking of the bacon. Or, if you don't like your bacon crisp, take it out at this point. Be careful! The plate is hot and the hot grease has dripped onto it.
Keep checking the crispness to see if it's to your liking.
 You may need to use an oven mitt, as the bowl and plate will be hot. Carefully take it from the microwave and put it down on a heat-safe surface. Use tongs to take the bacon slices off the bowl and lay them out flat on a paper towel.









If you let the bacon slices cool on the bowl, they will form a "U" shape for serving.
Be very careful not to spill the bacon grease as you remove the plate from the microwave.
 If you want, the grease can be saved for cooking. Either pour the grease into a storage container straight from the plate, or place it in the fridge (as shown here) and allow it to harden with cooling and scrape off. It makes fried eggs very tasty!









Dispose of the fat if you don't want to use it for cooking.
Be very careful handling the bowl and plate, as they're extremely hot.

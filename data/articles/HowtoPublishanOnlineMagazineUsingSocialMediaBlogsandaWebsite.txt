If you want your own hosting service, WordPress would be your choice as Blogger does not provide options for separate hosting. Hosting services might cost you 3.75 USD per month or above based on the plan and options you select. Or, you can use the free hosting platform using a sub domain or configuring your full domain name.

 Both WordPress and Blogger allow you to add authors for your blog. This way you can have a team of people who write for your magazine.

 You'll want to cook the entire dip in the oven once assembled to melt the cheese on top and ensure the flavors blend together. That said, the chicken needs to be pre-cooked, so this time in the oven is just to get everything hot., This simply makes it easier to blend into the other ingredients, preventing chunks of cream cheese in some parts of the dip and none in the others. Place it on the countertop 10-15 minutes before cooking to gently warm it.
 Using the microwave in 10-second bursts, melt the butter. Once you've got the butter in liquid form and well mixed with the hot sauce, move on to the next step. You don't want to cook the butter, just melt it.


For less spicy buffalo dip, use only 1/2 cup of buffalo hot sauce.
 Make sure the chicken is well coated in your buffalo sauce. It is okay if there is extra liquid at the bottom -- this will help coat the cheese.


If you are using frozen or cold chicken, mix the chicken and sauce together on the stovetop over medium heat. You only need to heat it until the chicken is warm again., Stir until they are blended together with the sauce. The cheeses should completely coat everything in the bowl. Sample the chicken and adjust the flavor how you see fit, adding more hot sauce to get to your desired heat level,


Alternatively, spread the cream cheese into a layer on the bottom of the dish, and instead add 1 cup ranch dressing to the chicken to provide the moisture., This is why you need to save half the cheese, as it will melt into a gooey, delicious topping for your buffalo chicken dip., Everything in the dish is already cooked, so you don't have to worry about anything "finishing." Instead, remove the dish from the oven when it looks good to you. You can also lower the heat to keep the dip warm if you're not yet ready to serve it.
 Allow to cool for 3-5 minutes, as this dip will be molten hot if you're not careful. You're done!.

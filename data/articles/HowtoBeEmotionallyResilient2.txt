 You've made it this far, so give yourself some credit. You have survived everything thrown at you up to this point. This is evidence that you can handle anything.Make a list of all the difficult things you have survived to create a visual acknowledgement of your strength and resilience. Your next hardship will just be one more triumph to add to the list.
 It may be hard to share your troubles because you don't trust others to care or be supportive. That is an unfair assessment of most of the population. Give people a chance to show you they care. Sharing your struggles will help you to feel less alone, and the responses of others may reveal untapped resources.If you truly believe nobody in your current social network will understand or support you, seek out new relationships by joining support groups or community organizations.
 This is not a call to go to church, though spirituality does provide many with a sense of meaning and hope.Witnessing the good in the world is not reserved for the religious.


If you are struggling to come up with examples of people overcoming adversity, research stories of hope online. You will find instances of people triumphing in circumstances similar to your own.

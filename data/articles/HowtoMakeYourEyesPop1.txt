 You'll need black pencil eyeliner, a light color eyeliner, and a white liner or shadow.;
, Any kind will do.
 Whatever brush or applicator you use normally should be just fine.
 You can use a handheld mirror or stand in front of the sink mirror as you apply your makeup. The second option is easier because you can have both hands free.
 With your black eyeliner, trace a line from the inside corner of your eye to the outside of your eyelid with the pencil.









It's OK if the line isn't perfectly neat right now. You can clean it up in the next few steps.
 Make it slightly thicker, smoother, and longer. The end should taper off slightly past the outer corners of your eyes








, Be gentle here — if you use just a little, it will make the lines thicker without having a completely overpowering effect.
 Start below your pupil — about halfway along the lid — trace the line back to the outer corner to meet the darker upper line.
 Apply your white color just along the puffiest part of your lower lid. This helps get red of dark rings beneath your eyes.

 When it comes to airfare, travelers would be wise to consider flying during off-peak tourist seasons. Flights booked from June to early September will almost assuredly result in the highest prices and most crowded trips. April, May, September, October, and the 10 days before Christmas are known as “shoulder season,” where good deals can be had but prices remain high. Flying during low season—November to mid-December and Christmas Day to the end of March—will yield the most inexpensive flights with plenty of seats available.;
, The majority of air travel bookings are conducted online, with dozens of reputable sites to choose from. Stick to the most well-known booking sites, as they tend to have the most user-friendly interfaces and regularly offer seat sales other sites cannot match.
 Flight prices can fluctuate greatly from one day to the next, and some sites will offer seat sales on short notice. By being diligent with your search, you can land a cheap seat to Italy before anyone else finds out. It might also help to create accounts with each site and request to be put on the recipient list for daily emails, nearly all of which highlight seat sales or other promotions.
 Flying directly into Italy may not fit into your budget, but a trip to a neighboring airport might work better. Taking an initial flight to London, Dublin, Frankfurt, Munich, or Paris and then traveling from any of those cities into Italy may be a more cost-effective way of achieving your goal. It likely won’t matter if you must travel during peak season, but during other times of year you should find success.
 While Delta, British Airways, Qantas, United, or American Airlines are among the largest carriers in the world, they won’t necessarily have the best deals available to international destinations. Smaller carriers, such as Meridiana, operate flights from the continental US to Italy and may end up being less expensive than the bigger carriers.

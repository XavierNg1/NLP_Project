 You can dress it up for a nighttime feel by trying the different variations in steps 10 and 11.
 Swirl the hair into a little roll just above your forehead and clip it down using any clip you have handy. You'll use this section later on in the steps.
 Start about two inches up from the roots and back-comb your hair down to the roots, creating volume.
 Make sure to leave a small section of non-teased hair at the base of your head to smooth over the teased section.
 Secure the Ponytail with a hair tie as close to the root of the hair as possible.
 Create the part that you want in the front. It can either be a middle part or a side part.
 Drape the end of the section over the top of the hair tie and wrap it around the hair tie as many times as necessary for the length of your hair. Secure with a bobby pin underneath the Ponytail.
 Try to hide the bobby pins as much as possible. You may need to pin on top of the Ponytail as well, but be sure not to disturb the subtle swirl you created.
, If you choose to do so, refrain from using hair spray until after you have curled your hair.
 Before creating the Ponytail, section off about a three-inch wide section directly above your forehead.


Tease the section by back-combing it with a narrow toothed comb. Spray with hair spray as you go.
Use a smoothing comb to smooth down the fly-aways but make sure not to compromise the volume you created by teasing.
Make a loop at the end of the section and carefully roll it up on itself, down to the roots.
Finally, fasten the roll in place on top of your head directly above your forehead with bobby pins in the middle of the roll.
Spray with hair spray and then create your Ponytail.

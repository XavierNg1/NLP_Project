 Many colleges and universities offer post-graduate CPA courses that include passing the Uniform CPA Examination, and other skills and requirements as defined by your particular state.


Some colleges offer extended resources similar to what is offered by self-study providers, including video and mp3 recordings of lectures for later review or to stay caught up when family or schedules interfere.

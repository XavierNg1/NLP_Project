Trim away any bruises with a knife. Cut vegetables into smaller pieces, at least 1/2-inch (3.8 cm) thick, for easier drying.






Place 1 quart (0.94 liters) of vegetables into a 36-inch (91 cm) cheesecloth.






Blanch the cheesecloth bag of vegetables on the stove in a half-filled pot of boiling water. You may also add 1/4 teaspoon (1.2 ml)of citric acid to the water. Allow up to 6 minutes for blanching, then immediately place the bag in cold water for the same amount of time.



Cut the fruit into 1/2-inch (1.27 cm) pieces or in halves to ensure even drying. Fill a large pot with at least 1 quart (0.94 liters) of water.






Add up to 1.5 teaspoons(7.3 ml) of food-grade quality sodium sulfate or sodium bisulfate to the water. Soak for approximately 5 to 15 minutes, depending on how you sliced the fruit. Rinse the fruit pieces with cold water before placing them on a rack to dry.



Collect the herbs right after the morning dew to minimize the risk of wilting.
Rinse the herbs in cool water and shake off any excess.



Slice lean cuts of beef or salmon into 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick (1.27 cm) slices. Cut off all fat because it spoils the meat during the drying process.
Freeze any meat or fish you plan to dry for around 30 days. The freezing temperature should be at 0 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 17 degrees Celsius) or lower.
Thaw the meat and fish in the refrigerator. Add salt, seasonings and any marinades of your choice before the drying process. Remember to wash your hands again after handling vegetables, fruit, herbs and meat.

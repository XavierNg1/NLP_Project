 Keep watering until water leaks out through the drain hole at the bottom of the pot.You shouldn't have to water your herbs more than once or twice a week.If you water too often, the soil will become waterlogged. This can lead to root rot, which can kill your herbs.
 Every herb is different, so you might want to read the seed packet, or the label that came with your herb. In general, however, most types of herbs need 6 to 8 hours of sunlight each day.A bright, sunny window would be ideal. If you live in a place that gets very little sunlight, consider getting a UV lamp for your herbs.


Consider rotating the pots every 4 to 5 days. This will help the herbs grow straight up, instead of bent to the side., Water, sunlight, and potting soil are not enough to grow healthy herbs. You will need to fertilize them every once in a while. When buying a fertilizer, make sure that you get something that promotes healthy leaves instead of pretty flowers. After all, you eat the leaves of herbs, and not their flowers., This will help them produce more leaves. When harvesting, make sure that you leave a few inches of stem on the plant. This will allow the plant to continue to grow. You also want to avoid taking the large leaves. These leaves capture the most sunlight, and aid the plant with photosynthesis.Many herbs will produce flowers. You will want to pinch these off, so that the herb can focus on producing tasty leaves rather than pretty blooms.The one exception to this is chamomile; the flower itself is the herb.
Pick leafy herbs, such as basil, right at the top of the stem.Snip delicate herbs, such as cilantro and parsley, closer to the base of the stem.Trim woody herbs, such as rosemary, with scissors or garden shears.

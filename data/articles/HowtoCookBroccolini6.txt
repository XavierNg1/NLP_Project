 Arrange the broccolini in even layers.

If necessary or desired, you can cut the broccolini into smaller pieces. The smaller pieces can be easier to fit inside of a cramped microwaveable dish, so if you are having difficulty fitting the tall, skinny pieces in the dish, cutting them up is a viable option.
 Add 3/4 cup (190 ml) water, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) olive oil, and 2 Tbsp (30 ml) lemon juice to the broccolini. Stir well so that all the broccolini has been coated in the mixture.

Ideally, the broccolini should be mostly submerged under the liquid. If some of the broccolini is submerged but some is not, it may not cook evenly.
 Cover the dish with a microwave-safe lid or microwave-safe plastic wrap and cook, on high, for 5 minutes.

Pause the microwave halfway through to stir the broccolini in the dish. This is especially important if some of the pieces are submerged in liquid and others are not. This can be skipped, however, if all of the pieces are evenly submerged.
 Pour the contents of the dish through a colander to drain the water. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and enjoy.

 If you have had sex recently, you could be infected. In the United States, however, the highest reported rates of infection are among sexually active teenagers, young adults, and African Americans., They include burning or pain when urinating, blood tinged urine, discharge from the penis (white, yellow, or green in color), swollen or painful tip of penis that is red in color, and tender or swollen testicles. In addition, frequent urination and sore throat can also be symptoms., Symptoms in women can be very mild. They can be mistaken for another type of infection. The only way to differentiate bacteria is by doing serological tests (specific antibody detection) and cultures (taking a sample of the infected area and see what organism grows).Symptoms in women include: vaginal discharge (can have a yeast smell at times), burning/pain when urinating, increased urination, sore throat, painful sexual intercourse, fever, and severe pain in the lower abdomen if the infection spreads to the fallopian tubes.
 Symptoms may appear within 2 to 10 days of infection, or as late as 30 days after infection in males.. Most do not exhibit any signs or symptoms; up to 20% of infected males and up to 80% of infected females have no presentation.Signs and symptoms can be very non-specific, so if you suspect you have gonorrhea at all, contact your doctor.
 If left untreated, it can cause numerous serious health problems, including chronic pain and infertility in both men and women. Eventually, untreated gonorrhea can be spread to the blood and joints, which can be a life-threatening condition.


On the other hand, gonorrhea that is treated will by cured by antibiotics and the symptoms will go away.

 Each color should have its own plate and fork so the colors don’t get mixed up and muddy. Choose any colors that you want for your fireworks! Red, blue, green, yellow, purple and pink are all great choices. Make sure you're working on a sturdy flat surface.
The color of the paper you use is up to you. Plain white paper is great. Use dark colored paper if you want a night sky background.
 Then press the fork down firmly to leave a print of the fork’s tines on the paper. Move around in a circle, repeating the same action. This will create a circular starburst effect. Reload the fork with fresh paint if necessary to complete the circle.Feel free to use forks from your kitchen or plastic utensils – they both work well.
 You can press the new color on top of the first to create a multi-color effect. You can also create separate fireworks using different colors that don’t overlap with each other. Experiment with a few different approaches to see which you like the best.

Create as many firework shapes on the paper as you want with as many colors as you desire., Mix a small amount of water with the tempera paint to slightly thin out the consistency. Use a paintbrush to pick up some of the paint and drop it onto the paper. You may need to experiment a bit on a piece of scratch paper until you get the right consistency., This will create a streak effect. Blow at different angles to create different kinds of streaks. Add these anywhere on your paper! Create a variety of effects by experimenting with different amounts of paint, water and blow pressure.Feel free to add any finishing touches you like, such as painted streaks or glitter paint.
Allow the paint to dry completely before moving your artwork.

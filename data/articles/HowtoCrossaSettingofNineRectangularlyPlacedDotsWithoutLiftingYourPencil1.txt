 To the bottom right quarter, draw nine dots, as shown on the setting image.









The dots need to be evenly spaced on a piece of paper that has empty margins.
You may want to draw your dots in a different color than the one used for your connecting lines.;
, Start at the dot in the bottom right-hand corner.









See how there are four dots on the bottom left and top right? In order to complete this puzzle, you must literally think outside the box!
Starting at the bottom right-hand corner, go left and stop where the fourth dot would be.
Go diagonally up and to the right connecting two original dots and stop where the fourth dot would be, on the top right.
Go down to your original starting point.
Go up diagonally to the left, using all nine dots (and two extra points).
 A true masterpiece. Now, can your friends do it?

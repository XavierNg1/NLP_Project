 Think about the size and the durability of the bag and make sure itÂ´s strong enough to hold all your books and equipment without breaking, or putting too much strain on your back/shoulder.
 This will avoid squishing lighter objects. If it's the first day, take a notebook or planner (don't take one if your school provides one) To avoid a heavy bag, only pack the books you need for the day. You could always leave extra ones in your locker.


Pack the books in the order that you will need them during the whole day. To make sure you don't forget any, recheck at least twice!
Include all binders you have as well as your homework, planner, notebooks, and revisions.
 Don't just throw in any pen in your pocket. Be more organized and pack the appropriate equipment such as:

Pencils and pens for writing etc.






Colored pencils and crayons for drawing - if you are 16, these may not be required.
Geometry set -- ruler, eraser, sharpener, protractor and set square.






Sticky notes






Calculator






Highlighters

 When you flex your knees, you put undue pressure on the bones in that joint as well as the kneecap itself. This undue pressure may cause the kneecap and the joints to grind up against each other, or it may cause discomfort in your knee ligaments and tendons. Some example exercises that put pressure on your knees are full squats and leg presses.


Avoid exercises that involve sudden or awkward movements for your knees. Any activity that involves a lot of agility, e.g., basketball or tennis, will put uneven stresses on your knee joints. Quick and sudden movements are dangerous for weak or uncomfortable knees as they tend to aggravate the problem.;
, When you jump, both of your knees must withstand a force equal to about 2 to 3 times your body weight. When your knees need to deal with that much weight, the chance of injury is greatly increased. Light jumping or hopping should be fine, but be sure to avoid any activity that involves jumping with deep bends at the knees.

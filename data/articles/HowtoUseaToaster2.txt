 If you aren't familiar with the toaster, set the dial to a lower number rather than a higher number. You can always put the slice back in for a bit more heat â€“ but you cannot un-burn a piece of toast!

, If you are making toast for someone else, ask them whether they prefer their toast darker or lighter. If they prefer their toast lighter, then set the dial to the low end: 1 or 2. If they prefer their toast dark, then set it to the high end: 3 to 5.
 If you set the dial to the highest setting, then you are playing with fire. Thick slices may press directly up against the electric heat filaments, which can apply dangerous heat to the food item.

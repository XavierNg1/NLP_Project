 Once recycled, PETE plastics can be used as fibrefill in winter coats, sleeping bags, and life jackets. They can also be used to make bean bags, rope, car bumpers, tennis ball felt, combs, cassette tapes, sails for boats, furniture, and of course other plastic bottles.
When you buy a PETE plastic packed article you can sell it after use to the government or private recycling centres, like selling a plastic bottle with labels on it will help the environment and earn money at the same time.
 They are hugely acceptable at recycling centres and are recycled into pipes, toys, plastic lumber, etc.
 These plastics include sandwich bags, baby bottle nipples, medical tubing, etc.



Cellular Phones - Mobile phones contain toxic substances, so sending them to landfills is not a safe option. It is estimated that recycling a cell phone can earn you around $200.







Printer Cartridges - Printer cartridges are easily recycled by simply refilling them. Never send used printer cartridges to landfills.







Batteries - Batteries constitute a huge chunk of toxic wastes and are pretty hard to recycle. Using non-lead batteries in cars and rechargeable batteries in gadgets is one way to control toxic pollution.

 Once the clothing is out of the dryer, it needs to be sorted. At first, help younger kids do this. Teach them what shirts go together, what pants go together, and so on. This can be done in their room on the bed. Loads with clothing from many family members may also be sorted in the laundry room with stackable plastic bins.All family members can help with this part. It’s usually the most tedious and labor-intensive one. Do it together and it’ll be more bearable for everyone.
 Early on, folding will be difficult. Children ages three and four can start with folding socks and towels. Around age five, they can put away their own clothes but won’t have a grasp on proper folding technique. That’s okay. Teach them at their own pace. As long as they make the effort, you’re teaching them in the long run.
 The final step is to get the clothing back where it belongs instead of on the floor. For younger children, first show them where you want their clothing to go. Do matching socks go in the top drawer? What hangs in the closet? Try labeling the drawers with stickers. Soon enough they’ll be able to put everything away on their own!

Older children may have a sense of how to organize the clothes for themselves. Still, they may still appreciate hearing suggestions on how to do this better.

 As December moves on you, and everyone else will be more and more busy, so booking early is essential.;
, Be clear that it's RSVP only, so you can gauge how many people to expect.
 Are you going to have a formal sit down meal, or a more relaxed buffet? Write a shopping list and stick to it. Prepare as much as you can the day before the party, avoiding any last minute panics. Keep things simple and easy - the last thing you will want to be doing is slaving away in the kitchen while your guests are having a good time.
 Make sure the area you are planning to hold your party is relatively clean and tidy. Remove any items that you are worried might get broken or in the way, and remember to put out plenty of chairs.
 Greet your guests at the door. Take their coats and see them through to the party area. Make introductions if your guests are not acquainted with each other and start off the conversation. Delegate arranging drinks to one of your guests, if someone is particularly shy this will be a great job for them as it's a real icebreaker.
 This is essential in setting the mood. Have a few CDs ready but don't play them too loudly, people will want to be able to talk.
 Charades or another lively game is always popular at a family get- together, whereas a more adult game will be suitable at a sophisticated get-together. Have plenty of pens, scraps of paper and balloons ready just in case.
 Being the host, people will look at you to set the mood. If you are looking stressed they won't relax. Similarly if you lead the way in having fun - they will follow.
 Especially if you have kids, let them invite friends. It will keep them busy so you can have fun with your friends. Just give them something to do.

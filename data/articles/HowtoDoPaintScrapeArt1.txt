 Tape a large sheet of wax paper onto a table or countertop to create a protected work surface. Then tape a heavyweight paper, such as cardstock, onto the wax paper. Since it’s taped to the surface, it won’t move around when you scrape it.You can also use a cookie sheet as an easy to clean work surface.;
, Grab some squeeze bottles of acrylic paint in assorted colors. Apply drops of paint along one edge of the cardstock, leaving the rest of the sheet blank.If the rest of the sheet is blank, you'll be able to drag the colors across the paper without muddying colors.
 Try arranging the dots in a staggered pattern, or at different distances from the edge of the paper. That way, the lines you'll make by spreading the paint across the paper will have a scalloped pattern.
 Scrape a small square of cardboard or foam board across the paper, starting from the side with the paint drops. Drag the paint drops across the surface in straight lines, curved patterns, or any design that suits your style.Instead of cardboard, you can use an expired credit card or old gift card., To create a card, let the paint dry then untape the cardstock from the wax paper or cookie sheet. Fold it in half so the painted sides face out, and choose the side you like best for the front. Grab some letter cutouts or stickers, and glue or stick them onto the front to spell out a greeting.

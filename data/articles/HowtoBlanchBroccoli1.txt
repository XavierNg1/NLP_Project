 Wash and cut the broccoli down to the desired size. Try to make all of your florets the same size to ensure they will all cook at the same rate.






;
, Fill a large heavy pot 2/3 of the way full with water. Cover the pot and place it on the stove over high heat.









Once the water has begun to boil add 1 tablespoon of salt to the water. Adding salt to boiling water not only adds some seasoning to the water, but it also increases the boiling point of the water. This in turn assists in cooking your food more efficiently!, While you are waiting for your pot of water to boil, fill a large bowl with cold water and a few ice cubes. Set it aside.
 Once your pot of water begins to boil, carefully place the cut broccoli into the boiling water. Begin counting blanching time once the water returns to a boil.









For florets that are approximately 1½" across, cook for about 3 minutes. Adjust cooking time accordingly for different sized florets.
The broccoli should be bright green and firm (though slightly softened) when you remove it.
 Either remove the broccoli with a slotted spoon or small sieve or drain the broccoli in a colander. Immediately place the broccoli in the ice bath to stop the cooking process.









Remove the cooled florets from the cold water after 30 seconds and strain them again in the colander.
 As with other vegetables, blanching your broccoli can be the primary cooking method or it can be the first step before sauteing or stir-frying.









Secondary cooking methods (such as sauteing) primarily add flavor to vegetables and don't usually cook the vegetables as thoroughly as needed. Blanching is a great way to pre-cook vegetables to be added to sauté and stir-fry's.

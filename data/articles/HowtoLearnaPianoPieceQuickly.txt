 Listen to the dynamics; this helps with mostly classical pieces.
 Setting yourself smaller goals within the piece of music will make it more manageable and less frustrating. Moreover, by splitting it into parts, you can listen to the dynamics with greater ease and try to follow along as you listen. This helps you to tell the difference between how you're playing and how the artist is playing the piece.


The extent of parts you split the piece up into will depend on the length of the music and how difficult it is; use your judgement to decide.
 Learn the right hand part first, then the left. Don't try to play them together until you can play them both individually, fluently.
 That way you'll know when you go wrong and you'll be able to memorize it easier.
 Rather than trying to play all the way through, play one line a few times, then add the next line, then the next.
 Don't try to play it at full speed until you can play it slowly without making mistakes.
 You'll end up feeling frustrated if you try to do it all at once. Take regular breaks and play other pieces which you can play while you're learning a difficult piece.
 If you need to spend 10 minutes on getting 2 chords right, then spend 10 minutes on it. It will be worth it in the long run and ignoring a problem part can cause frustration later on when it is the only part you cannot play.
 This will allow you to identify any places you are still going wrong. Remember to keep coming back to the piece now you can play it, so you don't forget it.
 If you stop practicing after playing it wrongly, you will remember it incorrectly. By making sure you end on a section you can play, the correct version will stick in your mind, making it easier to play next time.

 You might be tempted to use your fingernails to pluck the lens fragments from you eye; however, it’s important to pinch the lens pieces with your fingertips only rather than your nails. Otherwise, you risk doing damage to the surface of your eye.Further, it’s ideal to attempt removing a broken contact with fingers that have trimmed nails to avoid scratching your eye.
 If you’re unable to remove lens fragments with your fingertips, do not attempt to use any tools. Tweezers and similar objects can severely damage the surface of your eye or cause serious infection. Leave the equipment handling to your doctor.Even soft-tipped contact lens tweezers are generally not recommended, especially for removing lens fragments. The risk of causing an abrasion, or scratching the eye surface, is too great.
 Don’t rub your eyes hard if any lens fragments are stuck in your eye. The friction could scratch your cornea, or the eye’s surface. You risk not only doing physical damage, but you open the door to dangerous eye infections. In general, you should avoid rubbing your eyes too much while you’re wearing contact lenses.

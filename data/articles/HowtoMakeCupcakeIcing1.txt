 Beat the butter with a whisk or electric mixer with a paddle attachment. Stop once the butter is smoother and lighter in color. This takes a couple minutes.


If using an electric mixer, beat the butter straight from the fridge.If beating by hand, cut it into small pieces and let it soften for 10â€“15 minutes first.;
, Slowly pour in 3 cups (375g) powdered sugar as you keep beating the butter. This completes the creaming process, adding air bubbles that make the icing fluffy. When ready, the mixture will look lighter and larger in volume. It will also coat the sides of the bowl, with the mixer's paddle scraping ridged patterns into it.If you don't see this, or if you like extra-sweet icing, add up to an additional 1 cup (125g) sugar.


Powdered sugar is also called confectioner's sugar and icing sugar.
Too much beating can make your butter melt and collapse the icing.
 Reduce to medium speed and mix in the heavy cream and vanilla extract. Once thoroughly combined, taste the icing. If it's too sweet, mix in a pinch of fine salt. Salt has a complex effect on taste, but a small amount should cut the sweet taste a little.


Add more cream if the icing is too thick. Add more sugar if it is too thin.
 If chilled, the butter in the icing becomes firm and heavy. In hot weather, it melts into a greasy mess.Pipe or spread onto your cupcakes, then keep them at room temperature in an airtight box.

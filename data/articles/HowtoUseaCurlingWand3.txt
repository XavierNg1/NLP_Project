 You can buy a setting spray at a salon or buy it online. Mist your hair with a light amount of setting spray before you begin the curling process. This will help your hair mold more easily.
 Start towards the front of your head. For messy beach waves, work strand by strand. Using strands of about an inch wide, wrap your hair around the curling wand starting at the roots and moving down to the ends. In the front, curl your hair away from your face.
 As you wrap your hair around the wand, stop about two inches from the tips of your hair. Leave these last two inches uncurled for a loose, beach-like wave.
 As you finish curling the hair in front of your face, shake things up a little when you reach the back of your head. To create a messy appearance, curl your hair towards your face. Other than the direction you're curling, curl using the same process as earlier. Remember to leave the last two inches of your hair uncurled.
 Continue curling until you have a full set of beach waves. When you're done, run your fingers through your hair to loosen the curls to your liking. Then, apply a light layer of hairspray to set the look.

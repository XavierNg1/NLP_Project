 When a float is going to an event and there's a spare spot for another horse, ring around to see who needs the space. In turn, that person then owes you a trip to another event, and so on. You can share fuel costs and any other associated costs, as well as having someone to keep you company on the way to the event and you'll also be doing your part for reducing emissions into the atmosphere., Instead of owning it, consider hiring it. Or start a shared float-owning cooperative with fellow horse owners so that everyone shares the cost of purchase and maintenance of the floats at all times.

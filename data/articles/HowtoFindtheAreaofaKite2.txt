 This formula works if you are given two non-congruent side lengths and the size of the angle between those two sides. The formula is A=absin⁡C{\displaystyle A=ab\sin C}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the kite, a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} equal the non-congruent side lengths of the kite, and C{\displaystyle C} equals the size of the angle between sides a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}.Make sure you are using two non-congruent side lengths. A kite has two pairs of congruent sides. You need to use one side from each pair. Make sure the angle measurement you use is the angle between these two sides. If you do not have all of this information, you cannot use this method.
 This information should be given, or you should be able to measure them. Remember that you are using non-congruent sides, so each side should have a different length.

For example, if your kite has a side length of 20 inches and a side length of 15 inches, your formula will look like this: A=20×15sin⁡C{\displaystyle A=20\times 15\sin C}.
 Plug this product into the formula.

For example:A=20×15sin⁡C{\displaystyle A=20\times 15\sin C}A=300sin⁡C{\displaystyle A=300\sin C}


, Make sure you are using the angle between the two non-congruent sides.

For example, if the angle measurement is 150∘{\displaystyle 150^{\circ }}, your formula will look like this: A=300sin⁡(150){\displaystyle A=300\sin(150)}.
 To do this, you can use a calculator, or use a trigonometry chart.For example, the sine of a 150 degree angle is .5, so your formula will look like this: A=300(.5){\displaystyle A=300(.5)}.
 This result will be the area of the kite, in square units.

For example:A=300(.5){\displaystyle A=300(.5)}A=150{\displaystyle A=150}So, the area of a kite, with two sides measuring 20 inches and 15 inches, and the angle between them measuring 150 degrees, is 150 square inches.

 If you feel like someone suspicious is around, if you're feeling uncomfortable, etc. Arm yourself, if you have some keys or even a pen, (for women)if you're wearing heels, put them in your hand and go for the soft spots if/when attacked. Be ready for the blood spatter if you're using a sharp object.;
, Be alert of your attacker/s (there could be more than one, but you might not notice them until it's too late, in case they're hiding in your blind spot). While you cannot avoid the physical assault, you might be able to get out of it with minimal damage if you know what's happening around you and know where your attacker/s is/are or might be.
 Learn To Improvise. As nothing would ever go according to your plans. Look up Murphy's Law.
 Don't waste time thinking. In a violent situation, adrenal stress can limit mobility and even freeze you. Train to avoid that, either run or if there isn't any option, fight, so you can create an opening for yourself to run.
 Strike them first, hard and fast, then run.
, But that doesn't mean you have to go silent, appropriate amount of screams might attract attention of someone nearby, even if it isn't too near to your location, there's always someone or the other around.
 it's not 100% proven that it even works sometimes. But if you can scream, scream anything and everything.
 Then you can call for help, but don't stop till you get to a police station.
 Don't ever skip the details. Request a lawyer present, if you've used lethal force or if blood is involved without any eye-witnesses. Legal ramifications can be severe, if you can't prove it was self-defense. Until your lawyer arrives, just tell them the basics of what happened, i.e. You were attacked and warning the attacker did not work and so you had to defend yourself. Be calm and polite when speaking to the L.E.O. Do not lie or make up stuff.
, Even if you do have to, at least don't go alone or at night.

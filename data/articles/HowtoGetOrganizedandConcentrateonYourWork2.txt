 It’s time to clean house if your work area looks less than tidy. An unorganized desk can leave you feeling overwhelmed and make it difficult to concentrate. Eliminate the distractions and clutter by giving anything that doesn’t help you become productive an eviction notice.

For instance, focus on one area at a time and ask yourself if each object helps you achieve your work goals. Toss it if it does not. This could include furniture, files, papers, notes, books, or even pictures., You may be surprised at just how much of an impact the way your desk is set up has on your productivity. Take the time to determine what works best for you, or try this approach.

Place your monitor 17 inches away from you and at eye level. Phones and other supplies you use frequently should be placed on your dominant side to prevent you from having to reach over. Place items you use daily on your desk and place those that are used less frequently inside the desk drawers. Keep personal items to a minimum and place supplies that are used together close to each other., Don’t let your “to-do” piles threaten to take over your desk. In addition to reducing your organization, these piles can stress you out. Instead, create an organized place for them that doesn’t take up a lot of space.


Create file folders for each task or pile. Store them in your desk drawers, a file cabinet, or whatever you have available. Go through each folder and eliminate any unneeded paperwork inside of it once you’ve completed the project. Then store the file in a place designated for finished tasks., Coming into a cluttered desk at the start of your work day can make you feel frazzled and overwhelmed. Prevent this from happening by tidying up and organizing your workspace before you leave each day.

Organize your desk an hour before you leave. Doing so can help you find an assignment you may have forgot about and still gives you time to complete it before the day is done.

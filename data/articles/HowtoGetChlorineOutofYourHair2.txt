 Chlorine is an oxidant that chemically reacts with your hair and skin, and can be very difficult to wash away with conventional shower methods.


Vitamin C crystals (available from Trader Joe's as well as health and wellness stores) are very inexpensive, and can be used for much more than hair and skin care.
Dissolve one teaspoon (5 grams) of vitamin C crystals in a one-pint spray bottle of water.
You can also mix with a normal-sized bottle of shampoo or body soap—it's just a little harder to be sure the vitamin C is fully dissolved.
Spray yourself all over, rub it in with your hands, then rinse off or bathe as usual.
Be sure to completely cover your hair and skin—it can’t work where it doesn’t reach.
You’ll know right away how well this works by how your skin and hair smell. If you still smell chlorine, repeat the process.

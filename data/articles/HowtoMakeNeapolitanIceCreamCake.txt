 Stir 2 cups of the vanilla ice cream and chocolate together until fully incorporated. Place the mixture into the rear of a pan, then transfer to a freezer and allow to chill for one to two hours.
 If the coating is set enough, however, instantly add the strawberry coating., There should be approximately one-fourth of a cup of the strawberries. Add in 2 more cups of the vanilla ice cream and stir everything together. Pour the pur√©e above the solid vanilla ice cream and transfer to the freezer until set.

If you are freezing the ice cream overnight, keep any odor from messing up the ice cream cake by coating it with plastic wrap.
 Flip the cake over and get rid of the pan it was in. Serve immediately.

If the cake fails to come out of the pan, put it in hot water for half a minute, then reverse it above the serving plate.

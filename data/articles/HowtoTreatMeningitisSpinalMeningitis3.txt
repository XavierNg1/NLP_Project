 Headaches, fever, and nausea can occur for a number of reasons, and are common in simple, non-threatening illnesses. If your symptoms are more severe or different than how you typically feel with a cold though, you should seek evaluation. Familiarize yourself with the signs and symptoms of meningitis and watch for specific combinations of symptoms that may suggest meningitis over another illness. For those over the age of 2, watch for the following symptoms:Stiff neck

As soon as you notice symptoms occurring, see your doctor immediately. It's best to get evaluated if there are any concerns because a delay can lead to serious consequences and even be life threatening.Your doctor can diagnose meningitis by growing bacteria from a blood sample or fluid obtained with a spinal tap (or “lumbar puncture”). A spinal tap is performed by inserting a needle into an area in the lower back where fluid in the spinal canal is readily attainable – it’s a relatively quick procedure and isn’t too uncomfortable. Treatment will begin as soon as meningitis is diagnosed, or possibly even while you’re awaiting diagnosis.

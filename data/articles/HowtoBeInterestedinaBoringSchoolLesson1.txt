 Listening will help you stay awake; however, many students become easily distracted, which results in not listening well. In order to combat distractions, you must identify internal or external “triggers.” Internal distractions are mental or emotional. Examples include thinking about a disagreement that you had with someone, the errands that you need to complete, or even what homework will be assigned.
External distractions are harder to control since they come from other people and your surroundings. Someone might be tapping a pencil, there could be construction going on outside or in the building, or the speaker’s style might be annoying.;
, Now that you've learned to identify distractions, you can avoid them. Some types of distractions are harder to avoid, such as having migraines or caretaking for a sick parent. However, when you notice that you are distracted, bring yourself back into the moment. , Avoid sitting by the door, especially if it is open and you can hear hall noise. Sit in the middle of the room toward the front. Make sure there isn't anything obstructing your view. Above all else, don't sit in the back! Teachers do not remember students who do that, which is not to your benefit. , Teachers will do certain things to emphasize key points. They will use signal phrases like, "You need to know this....," "Nurses should understand," or the more blunt, "Write this down if you want to pass the test." They might use their voice or use body language to make ideas stand out. Often, they'll repeat what you need to know. Additionally, they will write down crucial information on the board or display it on an overhead.

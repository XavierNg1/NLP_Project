 Take note that your destination is not in fact inside the Undercity itself, but a little ways outside.;
, Being that the Undercity is essentially a sewer that the Forsaken faction has Squatted, the way to Orgrimmar would have to be outside the city. This can be achieved one of two ways. You can either leave the city on foot, by finding the convenient albeit hidden elevator leading from the Undercity to the upper level, or if you have a little bit of cash, you can fly to brill, and that will take you to the next town over, very conveniently located near the Zeppelin Towers.
 The zeppelin towers have zeppelins that shuttle back and forth to various locations in the vast Horde territories. The Zeppelins of this the Undercity station are: Grom'Gol, Orgrimmar, and Vengeance Landing. For Orgrimmar, go to the platform at the west edge of the tower. It should have several Horde emblems adorned on the signs. If you are unsure, the goblin at the platform will let you know the Zeppelin's destination.
 do know that you may have to wait a little bit for the zeppelin to appear, for the zeppelin has to shuttle players back and forth between the two cities. After a brief wait and a little bit of loading, You will arrive in the great Horde capitol of Orgrimmar!

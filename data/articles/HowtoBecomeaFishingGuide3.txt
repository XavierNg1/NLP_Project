 Knowing how to catch fish is an important component of being a fishing guide, but it isn't the most important requirement. Instead, knowing how to interact with people, and being able to stay patient with people as they learn to fish is #1. Consider how much you enjoy people. Are you charismatic and patient? Are you a good teacher and communicator? If so, you might make a great guide., Many people turn to guiding because they love to fish. Unfortunately, many guides never even pick up a rod during outings. Rather than catching fish for yourself, your sole responsibility will be helping others catch fish. Understanding this before you begin your guiding journey will help you become a better guide., It can take 3-4 years to establish yourself as a successful fishing guide. Additionally, during those first few years, you may need to invest in equipment. Look a good look at your finances and decide if you have the resources to start your own business. Consider starting your career as a fishing guide as a part-time venture while you maintain your regular job.

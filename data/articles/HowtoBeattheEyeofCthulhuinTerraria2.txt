 The best way to beat him will be by getting shadow/ Crimson armour (the later preferably) and get a Starfury using water bolts to find a floating island, This will mean you can hit him easily from the sky and very powerfully with the sword which is a mid-late game pre hardmode weapon. With this set-up, it is very difficult to lose

, If you've already beaten Skeletron, than you can find many beginning Magic weapons.
 This causes Meteorites to land. Out of Meteors, you can craft the Space Gun, which is an excellent Magic/Ranged., She drops the Bee Gun, which can hurt badly, especially since it shoots bees that hover around the enemy, doing continuous damage.
 This is a step only for intermediate players. In Hell, you can find Demon Scythes, Crystal Shards, and Flamelashes.
 He sometimes drops the Book of Skulls, which is an excellent magic weapon for those brave and strong enough to take on Skeletron.
 You can use an ore and it's respective gem to make gem staves, which can be very effective, and help with beating Queen Bee, if you want to do that.

 The first step for treatment is anti-inflammatories. These can be applied topically or given as a pill. Your vet may also inject some into or near the eye to help treat the condition., In some cases, the cause of the inflammation is something your cat got in its eye. The cat will likely need to be sedated before the vet removes the object., Often, antibiotic eye drops will be needed to help treat the problem, particularly if the vet removed a foreign object or if they eye has been scratched at all. The eye drops will help reduce the chance of infection.

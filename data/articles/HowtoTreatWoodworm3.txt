 If the woodworm infestation is too extensive, or if the woodworms have penetrated too deeply into the wood, you will need to turn to professional exterminators for help. Do-it-yourself chemical treatments only penetrate the surface layers of the wood and will be ineffective if the infestation is too severe. Signs that your woodworm infestation is severe enough to hire an exterminator include:


Crumbling woodWeak and damaged floorboardsVisible eggs, larvae or adult insects (beetles), Look online for reviews and recommendations of exterminators in your area. Ask friends or colleagues if they have dealt with similar issues, or if they have recommendations for local extermination companies. Call different companies for quotes and assessments before booking an appointment.
 Once you know what plan of action the exterminator will be taking to treat your woodworm problem, plan ahead. If fumigation is needed, find a place to stay while that occurs. Other methods employed by exterminators might include:


Spot application of strong pesticides that can only be used by certified professionalsFreezing of infested furniture, which will be wrapped and placed in a walk-in freezer for several weeks

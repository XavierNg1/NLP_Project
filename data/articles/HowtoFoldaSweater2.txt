 Try to use as smooth a surface as you can and work any wrinkles or bunches out. Using a bumpy or uneven surface won't let you get the best folds.


Place your sweater with the front facing upwards.
 Take your arms and fold them towards their opposite side of the sweater. Try to make them crisscross while avoiding making the folds bumpy or uneven.









Starting with either arm makes no difference.
Keep the shoulders level with the sides of the sweater.
 Take the hem and start to roll it up towards the neck of the sweater. Think of it as rolling up a scroll, old map, or a poster.









Don't roll the sweater too tightly as this may stretch the material.
Make sure the roll is as even as you can get it.
 Turn the sweater to the other side, so the front of the neck and sweater are facing upwards, towards you.









If the sweater looks bunched up or uneven, unroll it and start fresh.
 Gently slide a rubber band down the sweater, working it towards the center. Using the rubber band will help hold the sweater in a roll.









Make sure your rubber band is the right size to prevent its breaking.
Using a string will also work well.

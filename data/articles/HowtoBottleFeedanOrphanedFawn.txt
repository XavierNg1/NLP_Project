 Do not use cow's milk as this can cause complications for a fawn (see Warnings below).


A baby deer should preferably be fed a substitute that can be found at Tractor Supply stores (animal feed/farm supplies stores) or from some farms. If that is unavailable or too expensive, the next best thing is goat's milk (as they are in a similar family), which can usually be purchased at Walmart (large box stores) or other supply stores.;
, For fawns this size, add seven drops of lactate to the formula/milk being used.
Baby fawns: If the deer is about the size you would see in a movie (like, say Bambi), add some baby rice or baby cereal (or a substitute along those lines) with water until the consistency is about that of pudding. You will know the deer is ready to begin solid food when it begins to consume some of its own accord (like eating flowers or grass).
Older fawns: For older deer you may add a mashed up banana for the extra protein and potassium, but be sure the seeds do not clog up the nipple of the bottle.
 The hole in the nipple should be about a centimeter and a half at most for very young deer, going up to possibly two centimeters for a large deer. If the hole is too large, the milk may be consumed too quickly and upset the fawn's stomach. Of course, if it is too small, the fawn will have a difficult time getting the milk out. It is usually best to start with a centimeter and a half and see how the deer reacts.
 Cold formula can be unappealing to the point where the fawn may refuse it and it can also cause colic. Still, be sure it's not too hot either. If it feels uncomfortable to your hand when holding, this will hurt the deer when it goes down its throat, so wait until it cools some more.
 The fawn should be fed twice a day.
 It may seem uncomfortable to us but it allows easier access to the milk and also adds a sense of familiarity, as this is how the fawn would feed from a standing mother.

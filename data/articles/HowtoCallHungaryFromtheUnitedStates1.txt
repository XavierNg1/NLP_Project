 You'll need to signal to the phone company that you're about to make an international call. To dial the international exit code, dial 011 from the United States or Canada.The exit code is specific to the country you're dialing from, not the country you're dialing to.
Not all countries have the same exit code. For example, 011 is the exit code for Canada and the United States. But Mexico and much of Europe, including Hungary itself, use 00 as an exit code instead.;
, You'll need to indicate that you're calling Hungary. The country code for Hungary is 36 regardless of where in the country you're calling.The country code is specific to the country you're calling to. Country codes don't change no matter where you're calling from.
 Once you've specified Hungary's country code, you need to enter the area code for the city or town you're dialing. Most Hungarian area codes are two digits (except for Budapest). Area codes for some of the largest cities are:Budapest: 1
Debrecen: 52
Miskolc: 46
Szeged: 62
Pecs: 72

, Hungarian landlines are 8 digits long which includes the area code. Your call will go through once you've dialed the international exit code, country code for Hungary, the area code in Hungary, and the Hungarian phone number you want to reach.For example, a call from the United States to a landline in Budapest would be: 011 36 1 (123 4567).

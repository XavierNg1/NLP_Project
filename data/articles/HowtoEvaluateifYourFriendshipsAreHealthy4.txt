 The first step in dealing with an unhealthy friendship is being honest with yourself and with your friend. Try writing down what is bothering you about the friendship.Make a list of all the healthy and unhealthy aspects of your relationship, placing a star next to things you’d like to change.
After you make your list, write out possible solutions to the issues you identified.
 Ask your friend to sit down and talk about your friendship. Be honest with your friend about what is bothering you, and why you think the friendship might be unhealthy.


Try saying, “Kendra, I really value our friendship, but I feel like our relationship is unbalanced. I’d really like it if you asked me more questions about what’s going on in my life.”

, After talking with your friend about the relationship, you will have a better idea of whether you want to mend or end your friendship. Some unhealthy friendships are not worth your time and energy, while others are worth saving.Only you can decide whether or not you want to continue being in a particular friendship.
 If you decide you want to work on the friendship, both friends will need to spend time and energy making changes. Sit down together and make a list of ways you can both work on making your friendship healthier. Then make an honest effort to do your part.


If you or your friend do not make the agreed upon changes, you might want to consider ending the friendship.
 Deciding to end a friendship can be a difficult decision, even if the relationship is unhealthy. If you decide to end an unhealthy friendship, consider telling your friend why you are ending the relationship instead of ghosting them.Sometimes a simple email will suffice, while other times a conversation on the phone or in person is necessary.
Giving your former friend and yourself closure is the respectful way to end an unhealthy friendship.

 You can use "félicitations" the same way in French as you do in English, by simply saying it after you hear good news.


"I won the game!" He said. "Congratulations!" I replied.

"J'ai gagné le match!" Il a dit. "Félicitations!" J'ai répondu.;
, Félicitations is pronounced as follows: feh-lees-ee-ta-see-on. In French, the last letter of a word is rarely pronounced, so you don't hear the "s" when you say it. Remember, also, that "i" has a long E sound in French, like in the English word "see."End the word on a nasally "on" sound.

Listening to a native French speaker may help you learn the pronunciation.
 To congratulate someone on something like their upcoming wedding, use "félicitations pour."' This is the equivalent of "Congratulations on ____."For example:


"Congratulations on the wedding!" → "Félicitations pour votre mariage!"

"Congratulations on the promotion!" → "Félicitations pour ton avancement!"


, If you want to congratulate someone on an action, such as winning a game, you need to add the verb avoir or être. Which one you add depends on if the verb is transitive (avoir) or intransitive (être).A complete list of intransitive verbs can be found here, while any verbs not on this list utilize avoir. The past tense of the acting verb ("to win," for example) comes next.


"Congratulations on winning the game!" → "Félicitations pour avoir gagné le match"
"Congratulations on arriving safely!" → "Félicitations pour être arrivé sain et sauf."

When in doubt, remember when you use passé compose to conjugate a verb. If the verb uses "être" in the passé compose, you use it here as well.
Intransitive verbs are verbs, in general, related to motion.

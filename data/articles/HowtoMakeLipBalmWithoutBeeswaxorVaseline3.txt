 Made in larger quantities, it can also serve as a sunscreen balm for your whole body.


You’ll need green tea, unrefined coconut oil, Candelilla wax, honey, and avocado oil.
Zinc oxide, which you can order online, powder provides the primary sun protection.
If you don’t want to use honey, you can substitute an equal amount of natural aloe vera gel, either scraped straight from the leaf or store-bought. You can substitute another liquid oil, such as sweet almond or olive oil, in place of the avocado oil.

Cover the mixture, and let it simmer on low for 1 hour. After an hour, strain the tea out of the oil with a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth.
 You’ll need two tablespoons of your green tea-infused oil (you can store the rest in the fridge) and ½ teaspoon of Candelilla wax. Heat these together in a double boiler over medium-low heat.


When the wax is completely melted, take them off of the stove.
 Once you take your oil off the stove, you need to add in the rest of the ingredients in your sun balm.


Add 1 teaspoon of honey, 1 teaspoon of avocado oil, and 2 teaspoons of zinc oxide powder.
Stir until ingredients are completely combined.
 This step will make your sun-protectant lip balm creamy and airy. If you want to pour your balm into lip balm tubes, skip this step, and pour the liquid directly into the tubes.


Wait until the balm has begun to solidify and then blend.
Once your balm becomes fluffy, scoop it into the container of your choice, and label.

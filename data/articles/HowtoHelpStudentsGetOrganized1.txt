 It isn't reasonable to expect a first grader to be perfectly organized, although it is completely fair to expect them to try. Younger students typically love the idea of a star chart or prize box. They are generally not influenced by the threat of a bad grade. It's generally easier to try to instill neatness as a habit into elementary school students. Remember not to single out any very young students for being messy, as they (generally) are not very successful at taking constructive criticism.;
, Academically motivated students in High School or Middle School are typically organized: They have realized that being organized makes it easier to study and boosts their grades. For students who haven't figured this out, you need to talk to them and explain why it is important to be neat, and then you need to follow through and show that you expect them to be neat. This habit will really help them, so don't feel bad about it-its for their own good. At this age level, students won't organize their binders for a cheesy incentive like a prize box. They need some kind of disincentive.

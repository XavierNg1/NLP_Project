 Make sure you know which model iPad you are using, since they have different types of ports (places to attach cables and other devices).


If you using a first, second, or third generation iPad, you'll need an iPad Camera Connector Note: You may have to purchase it as part of the Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit

If you are using a fourth generation or later iPad, you'll need a Lightning to USB Camera Adapter.
 A list of the drive's files should soon display on your iPad.

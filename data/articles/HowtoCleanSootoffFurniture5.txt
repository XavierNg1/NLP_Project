 As with wood and other upholstery, hold the hose directly above the soot, getting it as close as possible without touching the soot or leather directly.
 Stiff leathers are a little more durable than other types of fabric upholstery, so you can pass a brush over the soot without risking immediate staining. Pass the brush over the soot lightly, once or twice, to remove free-standing soot. Do not rub.
 Use the same method described for wood, passing clean portions of the sponge over the soot in unstopping lines.
 Leather usually benefits from oil treatments, and the fibers that make up leather allow oil to pass in and out without too much difficulty. Since soot is oil-based, you may be able to work soot out of the leather by drawing and drying it out. Both corn starch and talcum powder are effective drying agents. Liberally sprinkle either powder over the soot and allow it to sit overnight before brushing it off.
 If you cannot draw the soot out of the leather, a leather cleanser may do the trick. Look for a cleanser specifically designed to treat soot or oily stains to reduce the risk of making the stain worse.
 Deep stains may require professional treatment for removal. Sensitive leathers, like suede, should not be home treated and should be taken in for professional cleaning from the start.

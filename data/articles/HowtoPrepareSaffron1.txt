 Your recipe will usually tell you how much saffron to use, but there are some general rules that are good to know. Saffron is usually measured in grams, the number of threads, or “pinches.” A “pinch” typically means 20 medium-sized threads of saffron. Use a food scale or count the threads to measure out the saffron.Adding too much saffron can ruin a dish, so it’s best to err on the side of too little. You can always add more if the taste and color isn’t to your satisfaction.
Counting the saffron threads usually offers the most accurate measurement.
If you’re adding saffron on your own, the rule of thumb is usually to add three strands for each person that you’re serving. Three strands is approximately a ½ teaspoon.;
, For saffron to really shine in your dish, you need to ensure that its flavor and color are released. The quickest way to do that is to break down the threads. Saffron threads are very delicate, so it’s easy to crush them with your hand. Use your thumb and forefinger to gently grind the threads into pieces. However, if you prefer a more uniform look to the pieces of saffron in your recipe, use a mortar and pestle to crush the threads.Crushing saffron for use in recipes typically works best if you’re making a recipe that already has water or another cooking liquid in it, such as risotto or paella.
Keep in mind that crushing saffron by hand or with a mortar and pestle doesn’t offer the most attractive appearance because the threads are no longer in tact. However, you can still get a strong flavor, aroma, and color from crushed saffron.
 Once you’ve crushed the saffron threads, simply mix them into your recipe. It’s best to add crushed saffron as early on in the cooking process as possible. That way, there’s enough time for its flavor to infuse the other ingredients and its color to deepen the recipe.Make sure that there’s already some type of liquid in your pot or pan before mixing in the crushed saffron threads.

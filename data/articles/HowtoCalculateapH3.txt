 First write out the pH equation. Next, identify the values you have by writing them directly below your equation. For example, if you know the pH is a value of 10.1, write it on the paper below the pH equation.
 Rearranging the equation will require a strong understanding of algebra. To calculate concentration from pH, you must recognize that concentration needs to be on one side of the equal sign alone. Start by moving the pH onto one side, and hydronium ion concentration to the other. Keep in mind that the negative sign with the log will travel together with the hydronium ion, making it an addition of hydronium on the opposite said.. Then subtract the pH from the left side and add it as an exponent to the right.


For example, pH = -logwill mold into += log^-pH. Note that the pH value has become an inverse log. pH can then be filled in as 10.1

, When working with inverse log, the calculator process is unique. Remember that log is a type of multiplication by 10. To enter your equation, key in 10. Next, hit the “EXP” exponent button. Key in the negative sign followed by the value. Hit solve.


For example we have a pH value of 10.1. Key in “10” followed by “EXP.” Now key in “-/+” to have our value be negative. Finally, key in the pH of “10.1”. Hit solve. You should get 1e-100. This means our concentration is 1.00 x 10^-100 M.
 Does the above answer make sense? If you have a pH of 10.1, you know the hydronium ions should be very small as 10.1 is a basic solution.Therefore, having such a miniscule number for concentration does infact, make sense.

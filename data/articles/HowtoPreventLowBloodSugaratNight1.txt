 Changes in your bedtime routine such as eating late, exercising in the evening, or other shifts in activity can cause low blood sugar at night.It is best to stick to a regular routine before going to bed, including in relation to when you eat, take insulin shots, and exercise.;
, If you exercise in the evening, you might reduce your blood sugar levels and possibly experience low blood sugar levels during sleep.If you must exercise in the evening, remember to eat a modest snack to help maintain your glucose levels.
Keep in mind if you exercised vigorously or for a prolonged period of time earlier in the day, this can affect your insulin sensitivity for up to 24 hours. You may need to adjust your insulin regimen accordingly.
 If you drink in the evening, your body will be at a higher risk of low blood sugar levels. Your liver may be too busy getting the alcohol out of your system to produce enough glucose during the night., If you eat dinner late in the evening or only a couple hours before going to sleep, you may experience low blood sugar at night. To avoid this problem, try eating dinner earlier in the evening.If you must eat a late dinner, you may need to use a fast acting insulin such as aspart or lispro instead of your regular insulin. Be sure to consult with your doctor. These fast acting insulins stop lowering glucose levels after two to four hours as opposed to three to six hours for regular insulin medications, so you will be less likely to experience nighttime hypoglycemia. However, you should be aware that each unit of fast acting insulin can potentially lower your blood glucose more at nighttime than if you were to take the equivalent unit during the day.
You should also take note of any insulin that remains in your system from previous doses of insulin medication. If you take too much fast acting insulin at night to cover eating late, you can inadvertently cause more nighttime hypoglycemia.

 Before you express milk or use a breast pump, wash your hands and the equipment you're using with warm, soapy water to prevent the breast milk from getting contaminated.
 If possible, express or pump the milk directly into the containers you're going to use to store the milk, rather than using a different container in between. Pumping directly into the container you're using to store the milk reduces the chances the milk will get contaminated. When you're finished filling the containers, close the lids tightly.
 It's important to label the containers with the date you pumped or expressed the milk and stored it. If you don't, you may forget when milk was first stored and accidentally reach for spoiled milk one day.
 Breast milk may be safely left on the table or countertop at room temperature for 6-8 hours at a temperature no higher than 77째F, or 25째C. If you're not going to use the milk within that time, it's necessary to store it in the refrigerator or freezer.Breast milk can be safely stored in the refrigerator for 5 days at a temperature of 39째F or 4째C. If you express or pump milk more than once in one day, you can add it to the same container. Store milk expressed or pumped on different days in different containers.
Breast milk can be safely stored in the freezer for 3 - 6 months. Don't add more milk to breast milk that has already been frozen; store it in a different container.

 Each pasta shell should be a bit bigger than the palm of your hand. Just place the shells in boiling water and cook them over medium heat until they're firm but not too hard. Read the instructions on the package to see exactly how long they should be cooked. Drain and separate the shells when they're cooked.,, In a large mixing bowl, add 3 cups (710 g.) of ricotta cheese, 1.5 cups (360 g.) of Parmesan cheese, 1/2 diced shallot, 2 tbsp. of chopped parsley, 4 chopped basil leaves, 1/2 minced garlic clove, and one generous squeeze of lemon juice. Salt and pepper to taste and begin to mix the ingredients together.


If the stuffing seems too dry, add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of cream and 1 to 2 tbsp. of olive oil to moisten it.
Stir until the ingredients are incorporated.
 Pack them tightly. Hold each pasta shell by its edges and press them gently to open them up. Scoop in a generous portion of stuffing and squeeze the shell closed. Place the shell in an oven safe dish and repeat this process until all 15 shells are stuffed tightly.
 Pour 1.5 cups (360 ml) of marinara sauce over all the shells. Make sure to cover the edges because they can dry out easily. Be generous with the marinara sauce. Cover the marinara and shells with 1 cup (120 g.) of fresh mozzarella. Tear the mozzarella instead of grating it to allow the cheese to melt freely over the shells. Drizzle a small amount of olive oil on top to help with moisture.
 Bake them until the cheese is melted and golden brown. When they're done, remove them from the oven and let them harden and cool for a few minutes.
 Serve these tasty shells as a main course or serve them with a side of chicken or beef.

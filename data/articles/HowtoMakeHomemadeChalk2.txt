 This all-natural method of making chalk uses ingredients you can find at the grocery store if you don't already have them on hand. Collect the following items in preparation for your chalk-making project:









Eggshells. If you are lucky enough to have an egg-laying hen, you might have a store of eggshells just waiting to be used. If not, find a way to gather as many eggshells as possible. If you start in advance you can ask your friends and neighbors to save them up for you.
Flour. This thickens the mixture and fills out the chalk.
Food coloring. Either the liquid or gel kind will work.
Molds. Use old toilet paper rolls, an ice cube tray, or any other type of mold of your choice.
Wax paper. You'll need this to line the molds.
Masking tape.
 Line your chosen molds with wax paper so that the waxed side is facing up. If you're using tubes, use masking tape to cover one end.
 Make sure they're totally dry before you begin. Use a mortar and pestle or a bowl and the back of a spoon to grind the eggshells to a fine powder. Be sure not to leave any large shards of shell; the mixture should be completely smooth.
 Mix two parts flour to one part eggshell in a bowl. Add water a little at a time until you've created a thick paste. Separate the mixture into as many bowls as you want, depending on how many colors you want to make.
 Stir a few drops of food coloring into the different bowls.
 Spoon the chalk mixture into separate molds, one for each color. Cover the molds with wax paper.









For a fun variation, try filling the molds halfway with one color, then filling up the other half with a second color.
Make marbled chalk by filling the molds with two or more colors, then using a wooden skewer to poke through the paint layers and create swirls.
 Wait at least 12 hours for the chalk to dry before popping it out of the molds and using it.

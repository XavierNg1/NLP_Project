 Parental abuse can take many forms, including physical and emotional violence, sexual abuse, and neglect. Parents may also have difficulties in relationships because of their own mental health or other issues. These things can have long-term effects on you., A therapist can help you identify negative patterns from your childhood and develop strategies for interacting with a genuinely difficult or even abusive parent.
 Set yourself up for success by scheduling visits in advance around activities you both enjoy. Remind yourself of the things that you love and appreciate about your parent, and tell your parent about those things. The positive aspects of your relationship can be a powerful base for building loving connection.
 Setting limits that keep you safe and healthy doesn’t mean you don’t love your parent. In fact, good boundaries can be the best foundation for a satisfying relationship with a difficult parent.


Be clear about what time you will spend together.
Plan for your parents’ old age. You might not be the best person to care for them, despite social pressure to do so.It’s ok to recognize that and make alternative arrangements.

A crisp skinned baked potato starts with the correct potato. When properly cooked, a russet potato will have the crispest skin, in part due to the starch content of the potato. A red skinned potato will also gain a crispy skin when cooked correctly. Other potatoes can be baked but the skin won't be as crispy. Choose potatoes without blemishes or sprouts and those that are firm and hard to the touch.;

Potatoes should always be washed prior to cooking. Rinse the potato under running water and use a brush if there is dirt that is difficult to remove. Then dry the potatoes with paper towels.






Pierce the potatoes several times with a fork to allow the steam to escape. Then, coat the potatoes in a light coat of olive oil. The oil will not adhere to the potato as well if they are wet or damp. Sprinkle the potatoes with salt and pepper.



Baked potatoes will become crispiest when baked at a high heat. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the potatoes on a baking sheet or in a shallow pan so that they're not touching. Bake them for about 45 to 75 minutes, depending on the size of the potato.



Carefully remove the potatoes from the oven. Using a clean kitchen towel to protect your hands, carefully squeeze the potato. If the potato feels soft and yielding then it is done. If it still feels firm and hard then it requires more cooking time.



Slice the baked potato open and allow it to cool for 1 minute, then top it with your favorite toppings and enjoy your crispy skinned baked potato.

 Have fun with your partner by doing things that both of you have never done before, and by creating routines or traditions for the two of you. By exploring new experiences and making new memories together, you and your partner can strengthen your bond. New experiences will create memories that you and your partner can reminisce and laugh about in the future, as well.If you live near the beach, you can learn to surf or paddle board together. Or, have you ever bungee jumped off of a bridge? If not, this might be something that you and your partner find exciting.
It can also be something simple, too, like taking a photography class together.
 Quality time can also strengthen a relationship. These are activities where you and your partner can explore your feelings for each other.For example, plan a romantic getaway for you and your partner. You don't need to travel far for it to be romantic. Make a reservation at a bed and breakfast in the city you live in, or in a city or the countryside that is only a couple hours away.
 Be more affectionate with your partner by checking in during the work day to see how their day is going. Whether it's a text or email, sign your messages by saying, "Thinking of you" or "Thanks sweetie."You can also be more affectionate by kissing your partner more passionately. Instead of a peck kiss or a kiss on the check, let your lips linger and maintain eye contact after the kiss. You can even say something like, "I missed you, today" or "I missed kissing you."
Holding hands is also a simple, yet casual way of showing that you care for your partner.

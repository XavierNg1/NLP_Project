 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Get out an 8x8-inch (20x20 cm) baking dish. Drizzle a little bit of olive oil in the pan and use a pastry brush or piece of paper towel to spread the oil around the pan. This will keep the baked tortellini from sticking to the dish.You could also use a casserole dish of a similar size if you don't have an 8x8-inch (20x20 cm) pan.;
, Get out a large mixing bowl and add 2 cups (515 g) of marinara or pasta sauce. You'll also need to add 1/3 cup (75 g) of mascarpone cheese, 1/4 cup (5 g) of chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves, and 2 teaspoons of chopped fresh thyme leaves. Use a whisk to combine the sauce.If you don't have fresh parsley and thyme, you can substitute dried herbs. Just use 1/8 of a cup (3 g) of dried parsley and 1 teaspoon of dried thyme.
 Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add 1 pound (454 g) of store bought cheese tortellini and stir the pasta. Cook the tortellini according to the manufacturer's instructions. This should take around 2 minutes. Carefully drain the cooked tortellini.If you'd like your pasta even softer, cook the tortellini a little longer. For pasta with more of a bite, cook it a little less.
 Add the drained and cooked cheese tortellini to the mixing bowl with the sauce. Use a large spoon to completely combine the ingredients. Pour the saucy tortellini to the prepared baking dish.Try to mix the ingredients while the pasta is still hot. If you let the cooked tortellini sit for too long, it will begin to clump together.
 Slice 2 ounces (56 g) of smoked mozzarella into thin pieces. Lay these over the tortellini and sprinkle 1/4 cup (25 g) of freshly grated Parmesan cheese over the mozzarella. Tear off a piece of aluminum foil and cover the baking dish. Bake the tortellini for about 30 minutes. The sauce will begin to bubble and the cheese will melt once it's finished cooking.Let the baked tortellini sit for a few minutes before you scoop it out to serve.

 This will be what you consider to be an acceptable level. Generally, you should aim for 60FPS or higher, as it is a nice smooth frame rate but 30+ will work in a pinch.;
, Using Modern Warfare 2 as an example, use shadows, because you want all the help you can get spotting enemies. Enable sync every frame, as with a lower end graphics card, tearing can easily occur. However, specular mapping, for example, leave disabled. You're not going to waste the limited graphics power you do have to make your guns shinier.
 Basically, you use a frame rate benchmarking tool (e.g. Fraps) to show your performance in-game. You increase the resolution, until you find one too high, and it goes below what you consider an acceptable frame rate (established earlier). Once you reach that level, go one resolution lower. This will be the highest acceptable resolution. It is VERY important to make sure this is 1024x768 or higher. Low resolutions are often handled by the CPU rather than the GPU, and this can lower performance, unless your CPU is powerful enough to EASILY handle running the game and rendering it.

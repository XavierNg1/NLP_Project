 If you want to go for a walk around the block, dance, or go for a bike ride, or whatever--feel free to do so. You are perfectly healthy, so you can act that way. Some women do get cramps or feel bloated or otherwise uncomfortable, but movement such as walking will actually help.
 Whatever makes you happy and comfortable.
 Some women experience cramps during menstruation, but this is by no means universal. If so, lying on your side and using a heating pad is a common solution.
 However, this is somewhat unlikely. First periods are typically light, and pads easy to use effectively.


Mattresses and computer chairs can be stained if the pad is not placed properly. If you have rubber sheets or a mattress protect, place them on your bed. You may have these in you home (or even on your bed) already.
Any staining will not be a huge puddle. Menstrual flow is not that dramatic. At worst, you would likely be cleaning a small area.
If you are really worried, you can put down a towel where you decide to sit. However, it is unlikely you really need to. But if you need the peace of mind, go ahead.
 You do not need to drastically change what you eat. Healthy foods and dark chocolate will help soothe cramps or headaches. However, sometimes on your period, you just need a bowl of ice cream or a hamburger and there's nothing wrong with that.
 Water is good for you; it will soothe your abdomen and reduce the amount of flow you get, and tea is always comforting.
 If your cramps are bad, clutch the pad to your stomach. Use a Â heating pad only if you know you can or if you have been taught. It is a good idea to start on the lowest setting, and then go higher and higher.

 Using a gravel siphon or turkey baster, remove bits of food and poop. Fiddler crab poop looks like tiny brown dots about the size of their eyes, and because of their small size they are easy to take out. Try not to suck up too much sand, or you'll just be dumping it away.


Move the sand around a little to uncover some waste that may have been buried.;
, Change 15-25% of water volume, and remember to add a water conditioner and 1/2 teaspoon of marine salt per 1.5-2 liters of water.


If there's floating waste in the water, quickly scoop it out with a fish net before it settles.
 Use a 5-10% bleach solutionto soak non-absorbent decorations for no more than 10 minutes. Rinse and dry them thoroughly. If you want to scrub them, then you can when rinsing. For live plants or absorbent materials like wood, soak in slightly salty water (made with a few teaspoons of salt in 1.5-2 liters of water) for 10 minutes and scrub with a clean tool.


Always let the objects dry fully before placing them back in the tank. If you used bleach, make sure there is no bleach smell left.

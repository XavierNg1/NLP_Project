 Tuck any excess fabric from the pillow case beneath the pillow as you place it on the exposed sheet at the head of your bed. The pillow should sit on the exposed sheet that you will sleep on. It should sit above the flat sheet and blanket that you’ve just folded down on top of your bed.
 This blanket should be similar to, if not the same as, the top blanket of your bed. To fold something in half vertically means to fold it so that the long sides are touching.
 It should cover your pillow and hang down equally on both sides of the bed. The top of the blanket should hang several inches over the head of your bed. Ensure that the blanket still reaches down far enough below your pillow so that it covers both the pillow and the folded sheet/blanket just beneath your pillow.
 Just as you’ve done in previous steps, fold the blanket into hospital corners at the two top corners of your bed.
 Pull the blanket taught on both sides to smooth out any wrinkles before tucking it beneath the mattress. When you tuck it in, avoid lifting the mattress as this might loosen the sheet and blanket already tucked beneath it. Simply slide the blanket in beneath the mattress using your hand.
 Run your hand over the bed one final time to smooth out any wrinkles. The purpose of this blanket is to seal your bed against dust, so you want to ensure that it’s tightly fitted to your bed, with no gaps or wrinkles.

Reread this list often when you start to feel unworthy. Try to naturally be a great friend to yourself and you just might attract others.
 It might be hard at first, but there's always good around you. It's easy to see all the bad things in the world, and to always be negative. Be thankful for something in the moment like the sunshine or your health.

 You don't want them to be scared, right? Dress more appropriately, such as wearing a skirt, a top hat, just something friendly.;
, Make them a room and such, as a cradle with a baby milk bottle.
 Some may get more attention than others, and that may be a lot of work. If you do decide to adopt more children, the best thing to do is talk it over with the kids you already have.
, If they behave give them certain privileges, or if they are a member give them a small gift.
 Be careful on what food your child gets, and make sure that they follow the food pyramid. If you are a non-member, you can go to a party or go to a friend's/family's house for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Also, make sure that he/she gets her vitamins and that your child isn't overeating.
 If they are at least 5, they can have a few toys. Make sure that your child doesn't spend too much time on one toy/game, though. For example, if your child spends too much time on a laptop, you can set up rules restricting how much time she/he can use at a time. That way, your child can have some diversity in her toys and take care of his/her's eyesight.
 So try to keep him/her in a crib mostly, and carry him/her around.
 You can ask people in the pillow room, or if you have any good friends, then ask them.

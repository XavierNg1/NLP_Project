 Another method is to force the rats to be on you until they are no longer scared. You can do this in addition to or instead of the bonding methods described previously.
 He should still have a sleeping den of some kind, just make sure that there is nowhere in the cage where you can't grab him. You want the rat to think that no matter what he does, he can't get away from you.
 The best time to take him out is during the middle of the day when he is most tired. Take your rat out and hold him for 20 minutes. Be sure to time it, because it's important that you do it for at least 20 minutes. You don't have to squeeze your rat, not letting him move. Feel free to let him run through your hands or even go up to your shoulder. The only rule is, is that the rat must stay on you, your body, and be touched and handled by you for 20 minutes. This could be on your shoulder, in your lap, in your shirt, as long as the rat remains on your body. In the beginning your rat will probably squeak and struggle to get away from you. Don't let him. If you're afraid that your rat might bite you, you could use a towel to pick him up.
 The theory is that a rat can only stay scared of you for so long and by dominating him like this, but not hurting him, he will come to accept you.

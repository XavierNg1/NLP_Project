 Look for the unsweetened kind in the grocery store aisle near the baking supplies. If you can't find shredded coconut, shaved coconut also works quite well., Every cup of coconut will end up translating into two cups of milk. Measure out the coconut into a blender or high-powered food processor.
 You'll need two cups of water for every cup of coconut you have. Measure out the correct number of cups into a pot. Place the pot on a burner and turn the heat to high. Let the water come to a full boil.
 Pour it directly into the blender. If your blender is small, you may need to do this in batches. Use a spoon to stir the mixture well.
 Place the lid on the blender and blend the coconut and water until the mixture is as smooth as possible. Be sure to hold the lid of the blender tightly in place with one hand, since blending heated substances can cause the lid to fly off unexpectedly.
 Place a piece of cheesecloth or a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl. Carefully pour the coconut mixture through the cloth, straining out the solid pieces. The liquid that is left in the bowl is fresh coconut milk. If you're using cheesecloth, pick it up and squeeze out the extra milk before discarding the solid coconut.
 Pour the milk into a jar and store it in the refrigerator with a lid. The fat in the milk will naturally rise to the top of the jar. When you're ready to use the milk, shake it first so that the fat mixes back in with the water.

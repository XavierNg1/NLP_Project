 Enter 10,000 into the Loan Amount column (cell B2), the number 6 into the Interest Rate column (cell C2), and the number 3 into the Term of Loan column (cell D2). The value in the Payment column (cell E2) represents the amount of the monthly payment ($304.22) given the terms entered. In other words, borrowing $10,000 at an interest rate of 6%, for a term of 3 years will result in a monthly payment of $304.22. If the value in cell E2 is $304.22, the loan calculator has been programmed correctly.

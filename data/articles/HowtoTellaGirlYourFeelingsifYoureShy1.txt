 What about this girl attracts you? Why do you feel the way you do? What are your feelings for this girl -- romantic, friendly, confused? Take some time to think about what you want out of your relationship so you can have a clearer idea of what to so.


It can help to write down your feelings, potentially as a letter to her. You don't have to send it, but writing down your feelings can help you get a handle on them.;
, Find out some things you have in common, and things you don't. Things you agree about, and things you don't. You and her could end up liking the same thing, and not even have had the slightest clue because she's been hiding it so well.


If you don't talk often, try and get her to initiate conversation. Hang out with her and her friends, sit next to her at class, and put yourself in a place to chat.
 Think about your feelings and find a way to say them. You might write down a few lines, get together a quick "practice line," or rehearse the conversation in the mirror.


"I think you're great, and would love a chance to get to know you more."
"I really enjoy our friendship, and I was hoping we could go on a date or two to see where things go."
"Let's go out on a date sometime."

, Preparation aside, you have to be ready to improvise when the actual conversation starts. This can be difficult if you are naturally shy, so don't try and overdo it. Say what you want to say quickly, then let her talk from there. Your response doesn't have to be planned, and it will come off more naturally if it is not.

 Many bands tend to congregate on the same label. Well known indie labels include Sub Pop (A great one. Has Fleet Foxes, Iron & Wine, The Head And The Heart), Merge, Matador, Hardly Art, Jagjaguwar, Ace Fu, Fat Cat, Domino, Almost Gold, and many other smaller ones. Even if the bands aren't necessarily related by genre or scene to any degree (other than the fact that they're on "indie" labels), listening to a random batch of music is a great way to expand your palette.

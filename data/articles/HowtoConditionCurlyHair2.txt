 Oils are a natural way to condition your curly hair without using chemicals or risking product buildup. What kind of oil is best for you depends on your hair texture and your own preferences.Jojoba oil is an extra-light oil that feels less greasy than other options. It’s good for all curly hair, but is especially useful for light curls.
Coconut oil is excellent at penetrating hair to restore strength, and is ideal for African-American hair.
Olive oil or grapeseed oil are medium-thickness oils good for medium to tight curls. Olive oil has a strong scent that not everyone enjoys.
 Warm oil is easier to use on hair, but don’t heat it up in the microwave or on a stovetop--this can cause burns! Instead, put the oil container in a bowl of warm water until it feels warm on the outside., Oil can permanently mark clothes, so be sure to put on a hairdresser’s cape, apron, or rain poncho over your clothes before beginning., Use about 1 ounce (30 mL) to start, and increase if necessary. Start at the bottom of your hair and work upwards, rubbing the oil into your hair while using your fingers or a wide-tooth comb to detangle. Be careful not to spread oil directly on your scalp--this can clog your pores!, Allowing your hair to absorb the oil helps it retain nutrients and repair damage. Leave the oil in for about five minutes. If your hair is badly damaged, you can leave it in for up to twenty minutes., Cold water helps lock in oil treatments. Rinsing out oil may take much longer than rinsing out regular conditioner, so make sure you get all the oil out! Leaving your hair saturated in oil will make it appear greasy. Let your hair air-dry afterwards.

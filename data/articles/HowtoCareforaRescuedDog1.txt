 Making your house safe for your dog will save you a lot of stress when you bring him home. Move household chemicals out of your dog’s reach. Protect your furniture with a throw or slip cover if your dog will be sitting on it. Look for any long cords, tassels, or dangling items that may be attractive to your dog.If you have a yard, make sure that your fence is secure. Your dog should not be able to jump over it or dig underneath it to get away.;
, Purchase a crate, baby gates, bedding, water bowls, food bowls, flea comb, 20 foot (6.1 m) leash, food, toys, and grooming supplies. When you go to pick up your dog, take his buckle collar, ID tag, leash, and a harness/collar with you.These supplies can be purchased from your local pet store.
It is important that you get these supplies before you bring your dog into your home. You want to start out on the right foot. The earlier you can establish consistency, the better.
 If you live with other people, sit down and discuss the house rules for the dog. Where will the dog’s crate, bed, and bowls be? What will the dog’s schedule be like? Also, remind everyone to be calm and inviting when meeting the dog for the first time. Avoid hugging, kissing, or patting the dog on top of its head.Discuss how the dog will be introduced to each member of the household. The dog should only meet one person at a time.
 Try to find out as much as you can about your dog’s previous life. This will help you deal with any behavioral or medical issues your dog may have. Some questions you should ask are:


Was the dog abused?
How did the dog end up at the shelter?
Has the staff noticed any behavioral problems?
How is his health?

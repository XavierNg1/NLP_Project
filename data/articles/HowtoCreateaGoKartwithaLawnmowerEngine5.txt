 Make sure your motor mount slots allow your engine to slide forward slightly, and then tack the mount into place.No dimensions are included here deliberately, as the size of your mount will change according to engine.


The motor mount should be welded as the final step to building your kart.
Your mount should be able to hold your lawn mower engine in the horizontal position.
 About 4" away from the middle of the throttle pedal bolt hole, weld this tab to your kart on a 45 degree angle.
 Take your brake rod and insert it through the tab, bending it to adjust it to the brake band. Next, take the tab with the rod inserted and weld it to the kart.
 Bend this 1/4" round rod so that it angles to meet your brake pedal assembly. Cut the length of your brake rod as needed, and weld eyelets to the rod with a return spring installed brake pedal.
 Many go-kart kits do not bolt seats directly to the kart. If this is the case for you, use a simple frame and bolt this into the seat braces. Your seat should be cut at a 37.5 degree angle for a 105 degree incline for your backrest., There are many different designs you can use, but the traditional side rail is formed of three pieces joined to form a rectangular rail with the side and back of the frame.


Side rails are an optional addition for your go-kart.
 Having finished with the body of your go-kart, you can now weld the mount to your frame. Upon completing your weld, you can add tires, seat padding, and all other necessary hardware to your vehicle.

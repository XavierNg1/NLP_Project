 Books have a level of detail that makes it easy to fall into their stories and tune out the world around you in addition to your own thoughts and emotions — including fear generated by something scary — and the distraction from scary thoughts is not the only benefit reading before bed offers; there are several good reasons to read before bed in general.


Be sure the book you choose is not scary or you will defeat the book's purpose of occupying your mind.
Choose a book that is happy, funny, or complicated enough that you will occupy your mind effectively.
Consider a book that deals with a topic you find somewhat uninspiring—such as a school textbook or the like, as this alone might put you to sleep.
 Humor is a great way to occupy your mind when you are too scared to sleep. In fact, good humor, including laughter, is good for your health too.The media you expose yourself to before sleep can affect your dreams, so watching something less scary before sleeping can keep you from having trouble sleeping in the first place.
Even better, choose something you are familiar with already — something you have already seen, like a favorite film — to watch after something scary. This will not only interrupt the possibility of the scary media affecting your dreams and your ability to sleep, but it might be comforting to some extent as well because it is familiar.
 A great way to occupy your mind when you are having trouble sleeping is by crafting. The repetition that many crafts require might act as just the mind occupier you need. Some crafts include:


Crocheting
Knitting
Cross-stitch

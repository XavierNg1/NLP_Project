 The possibilities of tactile stim toys are endless. Many are available at special needs stores, and more are sold as "fidgets" to office workers. Here are some examples of tactile stim toys:


Stress balls and rubber sea urchins
Tangles
Chains of key rings
Slinkies
Coil bracelets or beaded bracelets
Balloon filled with a fistful of flour
...and much more

, A large beanbag will also suffice. Leave it on top of you as you sit or sleep for improved focus and calm.
 Then place something heavy (e.g. a dictionary) on top of it. The pillow will distribute the weight more evenly on your body, mimicking the effects of a weighted lap pad.


This works if you can't afford a lap pad, or if you are in a pinch.
When piling things on your chest, make sure that you can lift them off, or that there are people around to help you if not.
 These will provide subtle deep pressure as you go about your day.
 Squeeze your hands tightly, rub your legs, massage your shoulders, and move your hands firmly over your arms. These subtle stims will provide deep pressure as you need it.

A surgical brush can also be used for deep pressure.
 Not only will you feel the soothing effects of deep pressure, but it will be from someone you love.

 From your device's home screen, open the app drawer and scroll through to find the Google app. The icon for this app is a blue square with a white lowercase "g" on it. Open the app.


The Google app comes pre-installed on most Android devices. If, for some reason, your phone does not have this app, you can get it for free from the Google Play Store.
 Once the app opens, scroll down and click the Options button at the very bottom of the page. It will usually look like three vertical dots but this can vary from device to device. Click "Settings" from the menu.
 On the next screen, you will see several options under the “Search & Now Cards” header. Tap "Accounts & privacy", which has a small key icon next to it.
 There are several settings on this page to change your history options. The most important is the "Web History" option. Click the toggle switch to turn Google History on and off.


When the toggle switch to the right of "Web History" is greyed-out and reads "OFF", your search history is not being recorded.
When the switch is blue and reads "ON", your search history is being recorded.
 The other options in the Accounts & Privacy menu can help you get your Google History settings exactly how you want. Your options include:


Google location settings: Will bring you to a screen where you can decide whether to have Google record your device's location.
Personal results: Allows you to set Google so that is does/does not use your search history to recommend more relevant search results to you.Manage Web History: Will open a web browser tab so that you can change more history settings just like you would if you were on a computer.

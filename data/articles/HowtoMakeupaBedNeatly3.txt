 Spread the comforter out evenly over the bed. Run your hands through the middle, removing any wrinkles or creases. You don't need to tuck in a comforter -- just let it hang evenly off the sides of the bed.
 You may only need the two pillows for sleeping, but you can add a few small decorative pillows to give the bed a nice touch. You can add as many as five or six decorative pillows, as long as they match and fit comfortably on the bed.


Arrange them over the original pillows, so they create a new row.
 Adding a few stuffed animals can be a cute way to give your bed some personality, especially if you're younger.

 Everything you accomplish in life should always start with a good long deep breath. Just to get you ready. Or for the sake of it!;
, You are justÂ trying to live your life, one day after another and he/she got in the way! He/She is not necessarily bad but today, you just have some other business to attend to. You do not need him/her as an admirer. Period.
 Just look as neutral as possible. You are not fake, but you are not cruel either. You are just you, delivering an unpleasant message.

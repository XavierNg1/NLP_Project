 Use the pipe cutter, hacksaw, or scissors to cut the tubing to your desired length. It will take a bit of effort to cut through, so take your time and be careful.
 Boil a large pot of water and insert one end of the tubing into the water for 30 seconds. The end of the tubing should be soft and pliable prior to fastening to the other end of the tubing.


If that’s not handy, you can use a blow dryer; however, this may take longer and involves the dryer being held up the entire time. Usually, just having a pot of boiling water available is easiest.
After heating, work quickly while the tubing is still warm and pliable.
 Push down hard on the connector to ensure a solid joint. The two should fit snugly, with the connector going nowhere.


Be careful not to push the connector too far down into the tubing. The other end of the tubing will need to fasten to it. It should stick out about halfway.
 If this is for a child or for exercise purposes, having something inside the tubing can make hula hooping even more enjoyable (or more of a workout). Here are some ideas:


Small beans (about 20-30)
Corn kernels
Water (a cup or so)
Sand
Rice

, If you have objects inside the tubing, manage it carefully so it doesn’t come spilling out the other end. This part should only take a few minutes.
 Just like you did in the steps above, seal the tubing into a hoop shape by connecting the last two exposed ends.


Again, work quickly. The tubing is more pliable the warmer it is. As it cools, it will contract and form a strong seal, keeping the hoop together.
 Add some personal flare, such as glittered tape, paint or any other enhancements you’d like. It can be drawn on with permanent or special craft markers, too.


You can easily make candy-cane like, traditional hula hoop stripes with colored electrical tape. It’s smoother than duct tape and blends into the texture of the tubing better.

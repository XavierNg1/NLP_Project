 You can use a different kind of paper, but it will need to be about as big as a newspaper page in order to fit most heads. Newspaper also tends to be easier to fold that construction paper or printer paper.







;
, Your newspaper page should have two creases in it--one vertical crease running down the spine of the section, and one horizontal, where the section is folded in half. Make sure the vertical crease is closed, and position it at the top of your work space. Your piece of paper should now be lying horizontal.
 The shorter fold in the newspaper should now be running vertically. There should be a diagonal crease along the edge of the paper where you folded it down.
 This should create the same diagonal crease on the opposite side of the paper.
 You should only fold the top layer. Fold the edge up by about 2 or 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm).
 Fold the bottom up so that it matches the fold you made with the bottom of the front side of the paper.
 Start with the left outside edge. Fold it in 2 or 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) toward the center of the hat. Then, fold in the right outside edge in. Make the fold the same width as the first outside edge you folded.








Adjust to fit. The distance between the outside edges can be adjusted, more or less, to fit your head.
 You can tape the outside edges down. Alternatively, you can fold up the bottom edge of the paper so that the outside edges are pinned down by the bottom fold.
 You may need to pop the inside out with your hand. Place the hat on your head.
 Add colors, glitter or other embellishments to your hat.

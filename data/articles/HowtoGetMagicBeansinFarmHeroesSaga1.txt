 Launch your Farm Heroes Saga game, either from your Android/iOS device or from your Facebook account on a web browser. Select a level and play it with the goal of earning as much points as you can to get a 3-star Growth Rate.;
, Make matches nearby required cropsies to give them crop bonuses. You can also focus making matches on one area, that way bonus points will accumulate on nearby required cropsies, so when you make a match with these cropsies, you’ll earn more points towards reaching maximum Growth Rate.


Try to also make four or five-crop matches (straight, T, or L shapes). This increases the chance of giving bonus points to required cropsies nearby, giving you more points when you match them.
 If your level has areas of grass where cropsies can lay, make matches there. Cropsies on grass will automatically get additional points with each move. The more bonus points the Cropsie has (and you make a match with them), the faster you’ll reach the level goals, and the more points you’ll get.
 Cascades often happen when you make matches near the bottom of the board. It occurs when matches are made with cropsies that come down from the top as they fill up the tiles your match had made. The more cascades made, the more chances you get in reaching the goal in just a couple of moves, giving you a chance to reach Hero mode.
 When you reach the level goal and you still have some moves left, you’ll enter Hero Mode. In Hero Mode, the required cropsies will randomly get bonus points with each move left. If you haven’t reached maximum Growth Rate for the level yet, use Hero Mode to help you get there.


The best way to reach max Growth Rate in Hero Mode is to try to make matches with cropsies that have the most number of bonus points. You’ll reach 3 stars in no time!

, If you don’t get 3 stars the first time around, try the level again. As long as you still have lives left, you can continue to replay the level until you get the 3-star Growth Rate.

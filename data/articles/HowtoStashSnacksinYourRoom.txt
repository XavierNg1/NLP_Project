 Or, alternatively, you could try to sneak them up while they are awake and moving about. This is more challenging, and a bag (ex: a purse) or hoodie (with pockets) may be needed.;
, (ex: a pantry not in the kitchen.)

, Make sure they do not require water or the use of a microwave, stove, etc. Refrigerated snacks are fine on one condition: that you have something to put them in (like a cooler.)

, You can do this by, if the item is small enough, putting it under your armpit, and walking nonchalantly to your room. If your parents or somebody else is awake and you walk by them, don't walk funny. That might give it away. If it's a bigger item, hold it in purse or jacket, or whatever you have that's available, so that you or anyone else are able to see the item.
 Do not simply toss them in an innocent cardboard box. This doesn't work, and if you leave the box open, you're done for.
 If you're going to stay up for a while, don't eat it very fast. You want to make it last.
 The worst way to get caught, is by bugs. Your parents will know something's up if you have some new pet mice.

For now, set the height and width to 100 pixels or so, then zoom in (the "+") key to see the pattern up close.


You can change the canvas size later, so don't worry about getting it exactly right the first time if you're struggling.You can choose any type of background, from white to transparent, depending on your desired pattern.;
, You might put something in the center, knowing it will repeat, or fill the whole thing up. You can even put in other images or text. If you've got multiple layers, right-click on them and select "Flatten Image" when you're done.If you're just practicing, place a dot in the very middle of the frame. This will end up creating a polka dot pattern.
You can turn on "View" → "Show Guides" to help you center and space out your pattern if you want exact measurements., You can find this up in the top bar. This allows you to save your pattern and use it later.
 This is all you have to do! Once you've finished renaming, your pattern will now appear in the patterns menu.

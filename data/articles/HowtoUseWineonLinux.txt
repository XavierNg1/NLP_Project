 When googling for guides type in "Learn Wine Linux". This may come in handy, if you would like more guides.;
,, If you don't see your version of Linux, try finding out what your version is based off of. For example "Linux Mint" is based off of the earlier Ubuntu and Debian versions. So most will normally work if they are related. But if you have an exact match, all the better!

, If you do not install from the box that pops up, after downloading:
Right click on the icon
Click install
Follow the steps

, You will now discover a new folder. It's called .wine. It's located in your home folder. For some it's home/user-name.


Go to the home folder.
Look for your user-name. Open it.
Once inside, hold down both of these keyboard keys and in order: Ctrl + H. You will be able to see all of the hidden or invisible folders.

Review: /home/user name/.wine/drive_C/Program Files.
 It is very important. Again it is your "Program Files." Remember where to find it and that it is invisible unless you press the Control+H in your /home/user-name folder.
, Otherwise, you will probably fail miserably.
 A rectangular box will pop up with many options. Click the option to install with Wine Windows Program Loader. Install a program.
 Attempt to run them and play with the program. If this does not work for you, try the words "learn Wine Linux" or "how Wine Linux" on this site to see if anything new has appeared. You might also find that typing the same words into blog.google.com is super useful.
 There are still many programs that are not working yet. However, there appears to be a number that do also.

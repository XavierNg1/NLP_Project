 Reduce water loss and oxidization by protecting the cut side from air. Here are a few ways to do this:


Place lemon halves cut-side-down on a small plate.
Wrap wedges or slices in plastic wrap.
Place the cut lemons in the smallest airtight container you can find.
 Although they last longer than most other cut fruit, lemons are still best within 2â€“3 days of cutting.
 Freeze the slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spaced out so they don't touch each other. Once frozen, toss them all in a sealed plastic bag and store in the freezer indefinitely.


Freezing lemons (or any food items) on a baking sheet prevents them sticking to each other as ice forms.
Like most fruit, lemons become mushy when frozen. The frozen slices are best added to cold drinks directly from the freezer, while they're still hard.

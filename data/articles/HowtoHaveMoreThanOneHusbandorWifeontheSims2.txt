 A simple google search for "Sims 2 Multiple Marriage Mod" can lead you to some useful links. It would also be beneficial to find a mod that prevents your sims from experiencing jealousy, but that's really your call. After all, jealousy can make for some fun (or at the very least, interesting) gameplay. Make sure you've correctly installed the mod, and that you aren't going to break your game (or computer) by doing so.;
, Go to the Neighborhood screen and click on "Create Sim." You should go through this process as if you were normally creating a new sim. Its gender, appearance, or aspirations don't have an effect on whether or not the multiple marriage mod will work, so go crazy.
 You can either create them within the same household as the original sim, or separately and move them into your original Sim's house (as long as there are less than eight sims already living on the lot). Moving them into the same house isn't the only way to meet sims, though. If you have the Nightlife expansion, your sim can meet other sims through a matchmaker or during a night of partying out on the town. You can also have your sim visit a community lot during the day (like a gym), invite other sims to your house, or chat with sims on the computer. There are always opportunities to meet new sims!

, There are tons of social options in The Sims 2, from just chatting to telling dirty jokes. You can even make them flirt a lot, but be warned: flirting only works if your sims have a certain amount of social recognition for each other. But once they start flirting, it won't take too long for them to fall in love.
 If they're happy and in love, you can have one sim get down on bent knee and pop the question. You can have them move in first, if they aren't already living together, but once they're married they'll be living together anyway.
 You can go through this process as many times as you like, marrying as many sims as you would like.

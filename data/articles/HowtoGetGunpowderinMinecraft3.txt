 Ghasts are extremely dangerous enemies that shoot fireballs from sixteen blocks away. They drop gunpowder at exactly the same rate as creepers. The main advantage is that they can also drop Ghast tears, a special item used in potion brewing., Follow the instructions in the linked article to make a nether portal from obsidian and fire.
 Entering the Nether is not recommended until you have diamond armor, plus a bow and arrows.


Ideally, enchant your equipment to make it even better. Fire resistance will come in handy.
A diamond sword is useful for killing other enemies in the Nether, but won't help much against flying, agile Ghasts.
 Look for Ghasts in large, open spaces, anywhere in the Nether. They are giant, flying white monsters with short, dangling tentacles.
 The Ghast fireballs are extremely powerful, but the Ghast will not fire through solid blocks. A glass barrier is a useful way to hide between shots while still keeping an eye on the Ghast.
 A Ghast dies from about three arrows, depending on how far you draw back the bow. Move behind your barrier in between shots, or shoot while running to dodge the fireballs.


Take care not to fight the Ghast above lava. If the gunpowder drops in lava, you will not be able to retrieve it.
 The fireballs move pretty slowly. You can knock them off course with an arrow or sword. Knock them away from you, and try to hit them straight back at the ghast.

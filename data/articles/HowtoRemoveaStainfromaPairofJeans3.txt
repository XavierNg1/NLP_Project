 Especially if the stain is fresh, your first instinct might be to wipe the stain with water. But as mentioned, H20 will only set the stain as oil repels water. A dry paper towel will instead soak up excess oil.


This method might not be enough for big or deep-set stains.
Try the steps below if the paper towel didn't fully absorb your stain.
 This method is good for fresh and old stains. Powders efficiently absorb oil and can get rid of most oil-based stains. Particularly if your stain is just oil. Simply saturate the stain with baby powder or talc, and let the powder do its magic for as long as possible - up to an entire day. Then, lightly brush the powder off (with a dry paper towel, or toothbrush), and launder your jeans in the hottest temperature the garment care instructions allow.
 Due to its high level of surfactants, dish detergent is particularly successful at getting rid of grease and oil stains. Dab a drop or two onto your stain, and add a little water. With a rag/cloth, gently wipe the stain with the detergent and water until the stain is gone. Then, throw your jeans in the wash and launder them as usual.


If you're on the go, the next step might be easier to implement.
 They'll do a good job at removing oil and grease stains. Simply dab the stain with a little bit of the powder and a dry paper towel.


Artificial sweeteners are particularly good when you're out and about.
If none of the above steps worked for you, go ahead and try this last option below.
 Pour a small amount of undiluted white vinegar on a paper towel. Blot the stain right before washing your jeans.This method works best on old stains.

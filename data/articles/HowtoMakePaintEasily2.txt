 Add the skin milk, linseed oil, and dye together. The oil and milk won't incorporate yet â€” don't worry about it yet, it will mix later.
 Add the builders' lime and salt together and mix well.
 Stir well. If possible, use a hand mixer (normally used to mix cake batter) to incorporate the ingredients until they are well blended. Start the hand mixer on low speed before moving to faster speed.









Add more dye or more milk if necessary during this step. If you are unhappy with the color of the paint, add more dye to intensify the color of the paint. Add more milk to mellow out paint that's too intense.
 For a smoother consistency, strain the paint through cheesecloth.
 Store in a cool area.

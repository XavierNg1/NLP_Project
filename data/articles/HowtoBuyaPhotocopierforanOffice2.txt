 The least expensive photocopiers will last several years without needing maintenance, but when they do malfunction, you may not be able to find a repair service.
 This allows you to avoid a large capital expense. Leasing often includes a service contract that will allow for regular preventive maintenance and the ability to have a repair person dispatched quickly in case of malfunction. Leasing also allows you to upgrade your copier as technology and your needs change.

 When you’re outside going somewhere—whether it’s to work, to visit a friend, or for a short shopping trip—plan to use a physically engaging form of transportation, rather than driving yourself in your car. Riding a bicycle will increase your heart rate and help you get some fresh air.If your destination is too far to bike to, consider taking public transportation. Since you’ll still have to walk to and from the bus stop, you’ll get more exercise than if you were to drive your own car.
 Walking is one of the healthiest physical activities you can perform, and it’s also a great way to pass your leisure time. You can always take a walk (of any length) for pleasure.


If you’re planning to visit a local store or park, walk there instead of driving.Even if you’re planning to meet friends at a local bar or restaurant, plan ahead, leave half an hour early, and walk instead of driving.
If you’re out shopping during your leisure time, plan to park far out in the parking lot and walk to the store, rather than parking in a spot near the entrance. This will provide a couple minutes of activity, and give the added benefit of protecting your car from dings or scrapes on the door., Picking up a physical hobby is a great way to stay active during leisure time. This doesn’t have to be physically demanding activity, or one that requires athleticism to begin.


If you live near a lake, rent a canoe and spend half an hour paddling around.
If you prefer to move around more than canoeing allows, grab a bike or a pair of roller skates and ride over to a local park.If you live near a recreation center, spend time daily playing basketball, racquetball, or participating in an indoor sport such as swimming.

 You can find the Settings app on one of your Home screens. It may be in a folder labeled "Utilities.";
, You'll find this at the bottom of the third group of options.
, The switch will move to the left, indicating that it has been turned off. When an app in the list is disabled, it will no longer be able to access your Calendar data.


If an app was pulling your contact data to display in the app (i.e. a daily planner app), this data will no longer appear in the app when you use it. Depending on the app's function, this may cause it to no longer work properly.
 You'll find this in the upper-left corner of the screen. This will return to the previous menu.
 Many apps that request access to your calendar also request access to your reminders.
 This will prevent the apps from accessing your Reminders data.


Like disabling Calendar access, the app will no longer be able to read and display your Reminders data. This could cause the app to stop functioning properly.

 Some neglected dogs will only need a bath and a bit of brushing, but many neglected dogs are severely matted. Severely matted fur often requires sedation in order to clip away the matted coat. This is because these mats are so tight to the skin that it is painful for the dog to have them removed. In addition, the dog needs to keep very still or the skin could accidentally be cut.Talk to your veterinarian if the dog has matted fur and needs to be sedated to remove the mats.
 If the dog is nervous or even a little aggressive, get a closed-end muzzle for the dog. Then, brush or comb the dog to remove any parasites, preferably outdoors. If the vet administered a spot-on treatment like Frontline, don't bathe the dog for at least 48 hours. Follow any other instructions your vet gave you to combat fleas and worms.To remove ticks, collect the following: rubbing alcohol, tweezers, and paper towels. Settle the pup down and rub the alcohol on the ticks, then start plucking those nasty ticks off of him. Be sure to dig the entire head of the tick out as well, because the tick may still survive. The dog may whine or wiggle if you hurt it, so soothe the animal by speaking softly and petting it., Dogs have powerful bacteria in their mouths, but depending on your dog's health or previous living situation, it may need to have its teeth cleaned. In general, vets say dogs should have their teeth cleaned at home weekly.They may also benefit from a professional cleaning now and then. How often your dog should go for a professional cleaning depends on the dog. Ask your vet for their recommendation.Pet stores sell doggie toothbrushes and toothpastes that taste good to dogs. In order to brush your dog's teeth, restrain them (most likely between your legs). Hold their head with your left arm and open their mouth with your left hand. Then brush in a circular motion with you right hand.Give them a treat afterwards. Eventually, they'll learn to love their at-home doggie dental appointments.

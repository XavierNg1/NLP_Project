 The rules about flying with pet birds vary by airline. Some require certain types of bird carriers, while others limit the numbers of birds in the cabin. Before you make your arrangements, research which airline will be the best for transporting your bird or birds. Depending on the airline, your pets may have to travel in the pressurized and climate controlled cargo hold.Loud birds are not allowed in the cabin of any airline.
Birds are not allowed in the cabin on international flights.
If it is stored in the cargo hold, certain airlines require that you cover the birdâ€™s cage in a wire mesh or a heavy cloth.
If your bird is traveling in the cargo hold, you may also be required to cover the bottom of its cage or carrier with newspaper to prevent a mess.
 Making connecting flights can be a stressful event for a human. The experience is even worse for a bird that can be easily overstimulated by the cacophony of an airport terminal. This can be particularly problematic if your connecting flight is in another country and your bird has to go through customs. In order to make things more relaxing for your bird, book a one way flight so that it only has to deal with the anxieties of an airport twice., TSA agents may ask you to remove your bird from its carrier when you pass through security. If your bird gets startled, placing it in a harness or having its wings trimmed will keep it from flying around the airport. This will also keep your bird from hurting itself if it happens to get out of its carrier at any other point in your journey., If your bird has to travel in the cargo hold, you will need to provide it with enough seeds and fresh fruit to sustain it during the trip. The fruit will help feed it and keep it hydrated on a long trip. If the bird is able to travel with you in the cabin, plan ahead and bring enough snacks for your bird.Do not put toys in the cage or carrier with your bird. They could become dangerous projectiles if the plane hits any turbulence.

 Books which have been subjected to water damage, immersion or a spill need to be dried slowly and carefully. An airing cupboard is ideal, but you may use a surface next to a radiator or a sunny window. Open the book to allow the air to circulate and gently turn over a few pages at regular intervals to prevent sticking. Once dry, press beneath several heavy books to flatten pages and restore the appearance.


Don't be tempted to use a hair dryer, oven, or fan. This can easily damage pages and loosen them from the spine.
 If the book is full of tiny holes, or if bits of paper flake off when you move it, it could be infested with book mites or other paper-eating pests. To prevent further damage, seal the book in a freezer bag with the air squeezed out. Place the bag in the freezer for several weeks to kill off insects and eggs.
 Mold usually causes a strong musty smell. Any book with warped binding, wet or stuck-together pages, or obvious water damage is also at risk of mold. Unfortunately, mold damage is extremely difficult to repair without hiring a professional. Store the book in a warm, dry location to minimize further damage.


If you see a furry white or grey mold on the pages, gently wipe it away with a soft cloth.
 In severe cases, you can repair the binding or make a new one. While not difficult with practice, it's best not to try this on rare or valuable books.
 Any librarian or rare book dealer should be able to advise you on more specialized cases. If you have a valuable or antique book, consider hiring a professional archivist to make the repairs.

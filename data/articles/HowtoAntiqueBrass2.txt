 Any type of household vinegar or even table salt in water can be used to antique brass. This can take longer to take effect than the other methods — several hours for vinegar, and up to several days with salt water— but you do not have to handle any dangerous chemicals and probably already have the necessary ingredients in your kitchen.


Prepare the brass first as described above to ensure the antiquing succeeds.
Wear rubber gloves for any method to prevent getting oil on the brass.
 A mix of equal parts table salt and water will oxidize the brass, simply speeding up the natural aging process brass undergoes. Apply it with a small paintbrush over the entire surface and reapply daily until you've achieved the appearance you enjoy., Apply with a brush or simply dip the piece in any type of vinegar. Allow it to dry, then apply an additional coat if you'd like a darker color.


Mix a spoonful of table salt into the vinegar for a greener patina.Heating the brass with a hair dryer or oven to around 450ºF (230ºC) will produce more noticeable results, but you'll need oven mitts or thick gardener gloves to handle it at this temperature., This may not achieve the authentic appearance that ammonia or antiquing solution will, but some people prefer the "gingerbread" appearance that results.In any case, it is certainly safer and less expensive than those methods.


Pour some vinegar into a plastic bucket with an airtight lid.
Place wooden blocks or other objects into the bucket so a stable, flat surface is dry above the level of the vinegar.
Place the brass on top of the objects.
Seal the lid to trap the vinegar fumes and let them alter the brass for several hours or overnight.
 Once the result you want is achieved, which may take several applications, wash the brass in warm water. Dry it gently with a towel or by applying heat.


Once it is dry, you have the option to preserve its color by coating with a brass lacquer or wax.

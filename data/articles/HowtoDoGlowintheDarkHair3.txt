 These paints are truly temporary dyes. You brush them in or use your hands to rub them in where you want them. You can even create streaks with different colors. Keep in mind, though, these colors will only last for a night or so., Another option is to use a neon hairspray. Like the paint, this color change will only last the night. It's very simple to apply. Simply spray into your hair where you want the color. Make sure not to breathe it in as you spray.
 You can also use glow-in-the-dark gel to add a bit of pizzazz to your hair for a night. The bonus of this method is that some gels even work in total darkness, rather than in just black lights. Simply spike it into your hair like you would normal gel.

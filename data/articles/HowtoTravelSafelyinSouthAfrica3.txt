 Ask your hotel or guest house concierge or other trusted people where it is safe to go and to warn you of places to keep away from. Some important things to keep in mind include:


Avoid going anywhere that is isolated, that is known for drug crimes, gang violence, etc. (ask so that you're aware!).
Don't go into the central business areas of main cities at night.Always take taxis at night. , As with most places, it is important to take sensible precautions when using ATMs and credit cards.


Keep your PIN covered whenever using an ATM. Use ATM's that are in well-lit places and not isolated.If people try crowding around you, leave that ATM and find another one. If there is any commotion at the ATM, leave, or suggest that people seek help from the bank - con artists can try any sort of distraction to part you from your money.
Don't let any payment by credit be made out of your sight. If a merchant tries to do this, demand the card back immediately and either find cash or don't proceed with the purchase. If it is a restaurant, go up to the payment counter and insist on seeing the transaction being performed. If you're worried that your card is compromised, contact your card provider immediately.
 Leave the expensive jewellery at home, avoid accessories or bags that are too flashy. Lonely Planet even recommends not wearing watches, no matter how inexpensive.Place all valuables and your passport in the hotel safety deposit box. Even then, place items inside sealed envelopes or lockable containers to prevent staff theft.
Dress down.
Speak quietly. Don't attract unwanted attention by being overly loud or brash.
Avoid looking at your guidebook or map in the open. Duck into a store or cafe to review where you're headed.
Keep bags well-held, never wear a wallet in your back pocket, and avoid carrying too much cash on you. Wear money pouches hidden well under your clothing if you need to carry a lot of cash.
Keep cameras in your shoulder bag rather than around your neck.

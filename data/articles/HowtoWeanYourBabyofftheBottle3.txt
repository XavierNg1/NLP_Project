 When you go cold turkey, you must expect your child to be unhappy about it. She may want her bottle, and she may not take no for an answer. By giving in, you undercut your efforts. It is important for the success of this effort that you remain strong. Don't give in to your child's demands.
 A major, and easy, milestone one can use for the transition to sippy cups is the child's first birthday. This coincides with the transition from breast to cow's milk.It is acceptable to wait a little longer, but make sure to wean your child before eighteen months.

Switch no earlier than six months, as children at that age are too young.
Aim for the child's first birthday, as this is a natural milestone.
 Tell your child that on a certain special day coming up, he will have the opportunity to trade all of his bottles for some fantastic thing he wants. Tell him he gets to take some time to think of something he wants, and if he chooses, he can make the trade.By planting the idea and giving your child time to imagine something he wants, you get him to sell himself on the possibility of giving up the bottle.


Remind him that the day is coming up.
Offer suggestions, such as a really nice cup or a new toy.

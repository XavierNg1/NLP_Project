 Not only will your nails look damaged, you’ll also push bacteria and saliva into your nail beds. This will gather dirt and debris underneath your nails and make them look dirty. Additionally, nail-biting can also lead to infections in your cuticles and the skin around your nails.If you’re tempted to bite your nails, cut them short so that you can’t reach them.;
, Whether you’re digging, scrubbing, or doing dishes, you should wear gloves whenever you can. This will protect your nails from dirt and stop any harsh cleaning soaps from damaging your nails.Sturdy cleaning gloves can be found at most grocery stores. Alternatively, you can buy a box of latex or latex-free gloves for single use jobs.
 Sometimes when you’re working with difficult-to-clean materials such as ink or potting soil you’re not able to wear gloves. In this case, protect the area underneath your nails by scraping your fingernails along a bar of soap.This will push detergent into your nail beds and block any dirt or debris.


If the soap isn’t soft enough to scratch, hold it under running water for a few seconds.
 If you find that your nails get dirtier as the day goes on, remove the dirt whenever you notice it. You can use a toothpick, a pointed nail-cleaner stick, an orange stick, or the flat end of a cuticle-pusher tool.


Make sure you wipe the debris on a tissue and throw it away. Otherwise, you may gross out your companions.
 This option may not be feasible depending on your job or fashion choices. However, if possible, spend some time every week painting your nails. Opaque nail polish will hide any dirt or discoloration underneath your nails.


Maintain your nail polish. If it starts to flake or fade, wipe it off with nail polish remover and start over.

 If it's for a special event such as Christmas or the Fourth of July, the colors will be fairly specific. For a birthday wreath or an anniversary, choose the favorite colors of the person being honored. Or have a rainbow colored wreath, either in rainbow order or higgledy-piggledy.


Another approach is to worry less about the colors and more about the button shapes and textures. Work with what the buttons inspire you to do first and then decide whether the colors are working for you.
Great color themes for Christmas: Red and green, just red or green, all white, silvers and golds, etc.
Color theme for a patriotic event: The colors of your country's flag.
Color theme for spring: Pastels are a great choice.
Color theme for fall: Prefer browns, oranges, reds and golds.;
, Map out the design by arranging the buttons in a circle of the same size as the wreath. To do this, draw around the outside and inside rings of the wreath onto brown or white paper. Remove the wreath, then arrange the buttons as you'd like them. Include embellishments if you're using anything other than buttons.


Note that it tends to be easiest and prettiest if you overlap the buttons as part of your design. This covers up the wreath base and looks more filled out when completed. It also means you don't have to be strict about positioning.
Carefully keep this arrangement alongside you as you glue the buttons into place; this will ensure you keep any pattern you've come up with.
 Following the design (or no design if preferred), start gluing the buttons onto the wreath one by one. Remember to add in any embellishments as you go.
 Add a hanger the back of the wreath and place it on display.

 Don't let him see you crying, and whatever you do, don't beg him to take you back.


Even if it's hard, pretend that you don't care.
When you get back together, you can hug him and tell him how you really felt. Now is not the time.
 Spend time with your best friends. Go to the movies, a concert, or just hang-out at their houses. Do whatever makes you happy.


Your friends will help you cultivate your inner strength.
 This is a tricky one. While you certainly don't want to lead on an innocent guy, nothing will get under your ex's skin like the knowledge that you are already dating again. Bam!

, Make sure you are out and about. Don't hole-up and hide under the covers. Get out there and show the world that you are just fine on your own.
 Be nice to them, but don't flirt: it makes you look bad. Be sweet and polite to them. Word will get back to him that you are looking good.

 Press 'Menu' on your click wheel if you are using the pedometer, or follow steps 1-3.
 In 'Settings', 'Pedometer' will be set to 'Manual' by default. Press the center button to change it to 'Always On' so you won't have to begin a new session each time.
 Use the click wheel to scroll down one option to 'Daily Step Goal'. From there, choose your step goal from the options listed or create your own goal via 'Custom'.
 To do this, scroll down until 'Weight' is selected. If you accidentally set the wrong weight the first time you used Nike+iPod or you have seen an increase/decrease in your weight, change it here. Note that the weight will be displayed in both pounds and kilograms.
 Scroll down until 'Screen Orientation' is selected and press the center button. From there, choose either 'Vertical', 'Right' or 'Left'.

 Let the ice cream sit out on the counter for about 10 minutes.


This step is optional, but allowing the ice cream to sit at room temperature makes it easier to blend. As a result, your shake will be smoother and more evenly flavored.;
, Add the three ingredients to an electric blender and blend on medium speed for about 30 seconds, or until evenly combined and smooth.


Start with 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) mint extract. Blend, and taste with a clean spoon. If you prefer a stronger mint flavor, add another 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) extract. Do not get carried away, though. Mint extract is potent, so a little can go a long way.Any milk or half-and-half will work for this recipe.
 Drop the food coloring into the shake and blend for another 15 seconds or so, just long enough to mix the color in.


As with the mint extract, start with the smaller amount before trying a larger amount. If you do not like how the shake looks with 4 drops of food coloring, slowly add up to 8 drops.
You could use either liquid or gel food coloring. Gel food coloring may have less impact on the texture of the shake.
 Pour into a serving glass and enjoy immediately. If desired, the shake can be topped with whipped cream.

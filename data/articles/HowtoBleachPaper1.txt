 Do not use full-strength bleach, as this risks disintegrating the paper. Instead, dilute the bleach in a ratio of approximately one tenth bleach to nine parts water.;
, Alternatively, use a spray bottle and spray the mixture onto the paper (this will capture more areas of the paper though, which is something you may not want to happen).
 Be aware that bleach will weaken the paper. While this may temporarily brighten the paper, it will also likely have set up the disintegration process, and over time this paper will turn yellow, then begin to fall apart. It's a temporary fix at best.

 While the product is fairly benign when used properly, the salicylic can be dangerous in the hands of a child. Application to facial skin could result in a chemical burn, and ingestion could cause nausea, vomiting, and even problems with the ear., Storage above these temperatures will likely cause the product to lose some effectiveness. The adhesive on the ring will probably slip, and the salicylic acid will not be concentrated directly over the corn.Also ensure the product is stored away from direct sunlight or severe humidity., Similar to heat-based degradation, age-based degradation will limit product efficacy. Aside from the adhesive inadequacy, the foam ring often included for comfort may lose its soft, spongy texture that protects against rubbing and helps alleviate some of the pain associated with corns.

 Thick, dense breads like whole grains and sourdoughs can take longer cooking times. Fluffy, tender breads like challah and brioche can't take as much heat and need shorter cooking times. Choose any bread, like ciabatta, semolina bread, baguette, or rye.Cut the slice thickly if you have a loaf.
 Turn the burner on the stove to low and place 1/2 teaspoon of butter in the pan. Let the butter melt. Make sure to use real butter and not margarine.
 After the butter has melted, place the bread into the pan. Make sure the bread soaks up the butter. Place a lid over the pan and let the bread cook for 2-3 minutes.


After 2-3 minutes, flip the bread over. Make sure the other side of the bread soaks up some of the butter in the pan. Place the lid back on top. Let this side toast for 2-3 minutes.An alternative is to toast the bread in a pan that has no butter in it. Just let the bread brown in the pan and then flip. Butter it after you remove it from the pan., When the bread has browned to your desired level of crisp, take the bread out of the pan. Do not add extra butter after taking it out of the pan.


This method of toasting bread cooks the butter into the bread, giving it a different flavor than if you add the butter after it is toasted. This method ensures there are no uneven chunks of butter on the toast, and helps the toast not to be soggy from too much buttering.
Toasting the bread this way allows for a crisp outside but a fluffy, chewy inside.

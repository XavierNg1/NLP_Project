 If you don't, you won't be able to get into the Nintendo Club website.


Registering on Nintendo Club's websitewill get you 100 points automatically, after completing your survey.;
, Sometimes, a small piece of paper can be found behind the manual included with your game, asking you to register (and subsequently receive stars).
 It will only take a few minutes of your time and no vital information is requested.


Each time you register a product, you should receive 150 stars. All you have to do is sign up and complete a survey about your buying habits and circumstances.
 Now you're starting the process rolling. Get a pen and paper ready.


There, it'll offer you the chance to swap your stars for Wii Points. You must choose the amount you want to change (they are often "out of stock"). If you choose to do so, you will receive a 12-digit code separated by 4 dashes.
Write it down somewhere! You don't want to risk forgetting.
 You already linked it to your Nintendo Club account, right?


This is on your home menu--the same place you create your Miis, get Netflix, etc.
 You'll be using the 12-digit code you received from their website instead of an actual card.
 Make sure it's correct and click "yes" to redeem your points.


Go back to the Wii Shop Channel menu and buy channels or games with your Wii Points!

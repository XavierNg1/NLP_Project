 Make sure that there is an exponential expression on one side of the equation, and a whole number on the other side. If not, you need to rework the equation so that the exponent is alone on one side.

For example, if your are trying to solve 3x−5−2=79{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}-2=79}, you first need to isolate 3x−5{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}} by adding 2 to each side of the equation:3x−5−2=79{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}-2=79}3x−5−2+2=79+2{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}-2+2=79+2}3x−5=81{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}=81}


, You need to determine whether the whole number can be converted to an exponent with the same base as the other exponent.If you can’t convert the whole number in this way, you cannot use this method.

For example, look at the equation 3x−5=81{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}=81}. You need to change 81 to an exponent with a base of 3, so that it matches the other exponential expression in the equation. By factoring out 3, you should see that 3×3×3×3=81{\displaystyle 3\times 3\times 3\times 3=81}, so 34=81{\displaystyle 3^{4}=81}. The new equation then becomes 3x−5=34{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}=3^{4}}.
 Since you converted the whole number, you now have two exponential expressions with the same base. Since the bases are the same, you can ignore them and focus on the exponents.

For example, since 3x−5=34{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}=3^{4}} has two exponents with a base of 3, you can ignore the base and simply look at the equation x−5=4{\displaystyle x-5=4}.
 To do this, you need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. Make sure that whatever you do to one side, you also do to the other side.

For example:x−5=4{\displaystyle x-5=4}x−5+5=4+5{\displaystyle x-5+5=4+5}x=9{\displaystyle x=9}


, You can see if your answer is correct by plugging the solution you found back into the original equation. After simplifying each expression, both sides of the equation should be equal. If they aren’t, you miscalculated and need to try again.

For example, if you found that x=9{\displaystyle x=9}, you would plug in 9{\displaystyle 9} for x{\displaystyle x} in the original equation and simplify:3x−5=81{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}=81}39−5=81{\displaystyle 3^{9-5}=81}34=81{\displaystyle 3^{4}=81}81=81{\displaystyle 81=81}

 You can buy specialized pairs of underwear that contain built-in padding for your bottom. They follow the same principals as push-up bras, but for your backside. They go by many different brand names and are available for purchase online and in stores that sell lingerie.


A silken texture is a good option for this undergarment as it will not cling to, or bunch up with, outer clothing.
 Choose pants with larger pockets in the back. The size of the pockets will create a fuller look. High-rise jean styles often include more obvious pockets, making this cut a particularly good way to create feminine curves., You want your pants or skirts to hug your body without being too tight (to the point of showing blemishes and the like). If you are wearing baggy clothes, the extra fabric will gather around your backside, making it look almost empty in appearance. Instead, look for a fabric and cut that moves with you.

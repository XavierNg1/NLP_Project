 Do this into a paper towel or rag.
 About a quarter-sized amount of dish soap will work. Turn on your faucet and wait for the water to warm up.
 While warm water is running, into your palm, swoosh the brush into the soap. Rinse and repeat until the soap no longer shows any signs of paint. This will require about three goes at least.
 Let it dry thoroughly before using again with oil paint. Lay it down so no water is trapped in the brush head causing loosening of bristles and/or chipped, warped handles.


This is optional, but you can also clean with mineral spirits every few months, for a deeper clean.

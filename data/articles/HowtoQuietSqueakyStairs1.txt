 Expect them to consist of three main parts: treads, risers, and stringers. A tread is the horizontal piece of wood that you actually step on. A riser is the vertical piece of wood rising from the back of each tread. Stringers are the framework that your treads and risers rest on.Expect your staircase to have at least three stringers: one on each side of your staircase, plus one running down its middle.
Very wide stairs may have additional stringers for extra support.;
, Walk up and down the stairs. When a stair squeaks, test the whole tread by stepping along each part of it, from front to back and side to side. Determine exactly where the squeak is originating from. Expect it to be caused by a gap that is beginning to grow between the stairs’ parts at that precise spot. This gap allows the stair to grow loose, so that one part rubs against another and/or the nails or screws holding them together.If you don’t have access to the underside of your stairs, locating the riser by sight is easy, but finding the stringers requires your ear. Gently tap the tread with a hammer. When one area sounds duller than the rest, this indicates a stringer running below.Expect each stringer to be about 1.5 to 2 inches thick (3.8 to 5.1 cm)., If you have access to the underbelly of your stairs, have them find the squeak by walking up and down the stairs. Stand under the stairs so you can see and/or hear when a step moves and squeaks.Save yourself some time instead of running up and down the stairs to repair each squeak as you find them.

 The wrong type or size can be a waste of money. The types available are varied in the materials they are made of and their size.


High impact plastic tool boxes come in a variety of sizes and setups. The most common found - and bought - are 18 x 8 x 9 inches (40.6 x 20 x 20 cm) with a plastic tote tray that sits inside. You can buy toolboxes in many sizes up to multiple-level and some are attached together with hinges with wheels for ease of moving about.
Toolboxes made from sheet metal are often made in first-year shop classes and highly valued by their makers. You can find metal toolboxes that start in the same size range as plastic toolboxes. These go up to tool cabinets with multiple-sized drawers mounted on casters.
Another type is not really a toolbox, but rather a tool bag. This heavy-duty cloth bag has its limits, but is popular for its light weight, multiple pockets and quick access to tools. This type makes a good toolkit to carry in the trunk of a car or behind the seat of a pickup.;

Assemble all of your tools, and then lay them out in the way you want to group them. As an example, put your SAE and metric sockets and wrenches in 2 different groups with special-purpose tools like flare nut wrenches, for high pressure lines, in another.
Some tools need to be stored separately for special purposes, such as woodworking or mechanical tools. A carpenter's toolbox, for example, is designed to carry the saws, squares and chisels that a carpenter or woodworker might use on a job site.
 Now, decide if there are any you transport frequently while others you use only occasionally. Divide these tools into separate groups.

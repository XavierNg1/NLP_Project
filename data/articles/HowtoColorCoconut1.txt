 If you're using the coconut for a meal or dessert, check the recipe for the suggested amount. If there is no amount specified, do a good estimate by guessing.;
,, You only need to add one to two drops of the food dye for it to spread its color quickly through the coconut. Add more food coloring for a darker color only once you know what the first few drops have achieved color-wise.
, Place the bag down on a flat work surface and press and push the coconut inside the bag. This will distribute the color through the coconut. Keep kneading until the color is evenly distributed.
 This can be used immediately or it can be left to use later. To store the colored coconut, place the sealed bag into the refrigerator until needed (check that the the seal is airtight, to keep it from drying out and to prevent bad odors from crossing into the coconut). Use within a few days of creating it.

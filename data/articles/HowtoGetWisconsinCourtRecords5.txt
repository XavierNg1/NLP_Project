 Because historical documents may not be as searchable as newer digital files, it's imperative that you make sure you have as much information as possible about the case, including the names of the parties and where and when the case was heard.


Court records must be held at the court where the case was heard for a specific period of time defined by state statute. After the retention period is over, records are released to the Wisconsin Historical Society.If you need records from a case that was heard in the 1970s or earlier, they probably won't be at the courthouse. If you're unsure about the date when the case was heard, try searching the circuit court records first, then search the historical records if you don't find anything.

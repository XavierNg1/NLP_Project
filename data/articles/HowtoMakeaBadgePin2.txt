 You’ll need a button press. There are small, simple versions that are available for cheap but these often produce a cheap-looking button. If you want to produce a nice final product and you have a lot of buttons to make (>500, maybe), then a press may be a good idea.


You may also want to get a paper cutter designed for buttons, since this can make the process much faster. places that sell button presses often sell the cutters as well. Make sure to buy a cutter which is for the same size as your button machine.
 You will need button casing in the correct size for your machine. Make sure you have the metal or plastic disk, the matching back pin, and the mylar plastic front.
 Print the images on regular printer paper. Make sure they are the right size for your buttons. Cut them as evenly and cleanly as you can.
 The rounded top should be facing up and the disk should be placed in the side which swings and stops on the right (theoretically, the left hole).
 The image should be face up and aligned how you wish it to appear (assuming the holders are in the horizontal position). Cover the image with the clear plastic.
 The pin back goes in the other holder. The pin side should be facing down and the coil should be pointing to the right (and aligned horizontally).
 Turn the holders so that the pieces with the image are under the press. Press down the handle. The pieces should disappear.
 Turn the holders the opposite way so that the pin back is under the press. Press this down.
 You’re done! Enjoy your badge!

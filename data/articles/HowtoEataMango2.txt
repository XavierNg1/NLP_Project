 Cut the mango into halves or thirds while avoiding the large pit. Then, make vertical cuts on the piece you're holding. Be careful not to cut through the skin. Now make horizontal cuts to create a checkered pattern. Grasp the skin on the back of the half and push it forward.


The chunks you cut should come out, making the mango piece look like a flower.
Next, just pull off the mango chunks.
If they don't give, use a knife to slice them off into a bowl or a spoon to scrape them off.
 Place the cubed mango in a bowl, grab a spoon, and enjoy! If you want to save the cubed mango for later, put it in Tupperware, but recognize that it's best enjoyed fresh and will get soggy if you put it away for a while.


Add a touch of lemon juice to the mango for zest.
 Cubed mango can be a fantastic addition to any fruit salad. If you don't want the salad to be overwhelmed by mango juice, drain the mango chunks before adding them to the salad. Here are some suggestions for making a delicious mango salad:Â :

 Consider waiting in your room for 20 minutes or so, then go out and talk to them. They should be more calm at that point.;
, The whole point of being grounded is so that you learn a lesson. Your parents will be a little more lenient with you if you acknowledge that you did something wrong. Admit that you did something wrong (even if it's hard), apologize and accept your punishment.
 If you are grounded from the phone for a week, don't sneak on when your parents are gone. You're not going to learn anything, and your parents might double your grounding if they find out. Also, you will lose their trust, which has longer lasting effects then simply being grounded If you try to talk to them they would even ignore you.
 The last thing you want is to be caught doing something wrong when you're already in the doghouse. If you usually have to be told to take out the trash, do so without being asked. Increased responsibility during punishment pleases many parents.
 While you may be really mad at your mom for unfairly taking away your computer, remember that giving them attitude and talking back is not going to do you any good. They may say provoking comments that make you want to snap, but don't. If they are giving you the silent treatment, accept it and find something else to do.
 If you are used to spending all day online listening to Paramore on Facebook, and your parents have taken away your computer, discover a new hobby, even if only temporarily. Read a book, organize your room, daydream, make a list of things you love/hate, try doing something fun/wacky with your hair. Being grounded doesn't mean you have to be bored.
 If your parents ground you for a week and you absolutely must accept it, then go through it. When the punishment is up, don't run out of the house. This just lets your parents know that they know how to punish you.

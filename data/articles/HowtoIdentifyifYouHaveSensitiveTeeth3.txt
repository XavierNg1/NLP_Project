If you're brushing vigorously, it could lead to increased tooth sensitivity and receding gums., Teeth whitening products often use hydrogen peroxide which wears down the enamel and could penetrate into any existing decay or inner areas of the tooth.Aside from potential pain and sensitivity, whitening does not affect various dental restorations such as crowns or porcelain veneers, which could cause multi-colored teeth, negating any vanity aspects of the procedure.
 Symptoms vary according to the nature, frequency and duration of excessive clenching and grinding. Aside from general sensitivity, grinding can include pain in the teeth, chronic muscular facial pain with tension headaches, flattened tooth surfaces, micro fractures of the tooth enamel, broken or chipped teeth, pain in the jaw joint that cause restricted opening and difficult chewing.If grinding is an old habit, you might usually have an increased development of the masseter and temporal muscles that change the look of your face, making your face seem muscular and always tense.
 Post dental treatment sensitivity can be created by inflammation and very subtle movement within and between teeth. If you recently had a procedure done at the dentist, there is a possibility of sensitivity., Acidic foods and drinks (e.g. tomatoes, pickles, fruits, soda) can wear down enamel if consumed regularly and in abundance.They may also be the culprits behind some acid reflux, which can also erode enamel.

 Lay the slices out on a cutting board, stack a few at a time and cut again lengthwise, so the end result is long square strips.
, Carefully place towel-dried potato strips in oil (if they're wet, the water on the potatoes will make the oil spatter and burn you!) and cook several minutes in the hot oil, turning frequently until they become light golden all over.


If you have a deep fryer, follow instructions for the appliance; put potatoes in the deep fryer basket and fry them until golden brown, then carefully remove the basket from the fryer and put potatoes on plate with a paper towel to absorb the excess oil.
 If you have a stove and two pots but no microwave, start the cheese sauce first. Put about two inches of water in the bottom of the larger pot, place the smaller of the two pots inside of the larger one, and grate the cheese into the smaller pot. Put this pot 'nest' on stove on medium heat. The cheese will melt and can stay warm in the smaller nested pot until the fries are cooked.

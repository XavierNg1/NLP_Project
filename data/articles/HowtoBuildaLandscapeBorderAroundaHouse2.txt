 After the mortar has finished drying, fill the ditch in between the bricks and the house with garden soil. You can use soil that you removed previously or specially purchase garden soil. Regardless of what soil you use or which plants you choose for your border, you should also enrich the soil by digging compost into the top foot (30.5 cm).
 Having too much sitting water near the foundation of your home can cause problems. Water can leak into basements and bottom floors, especially on older homes, and moist soil can also draw insects that could later find their way into your house from your border garden.
 If you want a few flowering shrubs, though, you should make sure that the ones you choose have flowers with hues that will complement one another rather than compete, especially if the flowers will be blooming at the same time.
 Tall plants soften the edge of a home, making smaller homes look larger.
 After you have finished planting, apply a layer of mulch over the area and around the base of your plants. Even though mulch retains moisture, it also helps to prevent it from leaking into the house. Mulch regulates the soil temperature, preventing it from becoming too hot or cold, as well. Moreover, mulch also prevents weeds and grass from poking through the soil.

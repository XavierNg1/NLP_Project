 For sufferers of anxiety attacks, the feelings of worry and dread associated with anxiety can "snowball", becoming so intense that they overwhelm everything else, and leave the sufferer stunned, panicking, and unable to process what is going on. These episodes are often brought on by high-stress events or situations, are extremely unpleasant and bewildering, and can last from a few minutes, to hours or even entire days. Anxiety attack sufferers often experience a "deer-in-the-headlights" feeling of being stunned and unable to decide how to respond to a stressful situation.
 Sufferers of anxiety attacks often experience sharp drops or increases in body temperature (hot or cold flashes), as well as feelings of intense shortness of breath or rapid, erratic heartbeat. , Anxiety attacks are often accompanied by obsessive thoughts, which are intense, and unwanted thoughts associated with a problem, worry, or stressful situation. During an anxiety attack, these thoughts may seem to engulf the sufferer, making it difficult or impossible for them to focus on anything else.While these obsessive thoughts may be associated with a concrete problem in the sufferer's life, they can also be much more abstract. For instance, the obsession may be centered on a disturbing or stressful image or sound which becomes "stuck" in the sufferer's mind, preventing thought of anything else.
 Anxiety attacks are painful, and often debilitating. The physical and emotional strain associated with regular, intense anxiety can also have long-term effects on your health. If you are struggling with anxiety , you should talk with a medical doctor, psychiatrist, or counselor about your symptoms, and possible treatments for anxiety. The simple act of asking for help from others can help alleviate your symptoms, and set you on a path for less-stressed living.

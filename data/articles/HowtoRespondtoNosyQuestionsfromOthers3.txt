 Nosy questions often follow telling environmental cues. If you want to expertly dodge intrusive questions, learn to assess your environment and behave accordingly.For instance, there may be a sudden pause as the person prepares to ask the question. Or, maybe something in the environment, like a crying infant, prompts the question.
When you sense a nosy question coming, get busy to send the message that you no longer have time to chat. Open a book and become engrossed. Or, check emails on your phone.
 If you have certain coworkers, acquaintances, or family members who are overly inquisitive about your personal life, set firm boundaries with them. If you would prefer to not be asked questions of a personal nature, make it your business to never answer them. If you don’t feed them with information, they won’t expect to get it from you., If you want to avoid being blindsided by someone’s poorly timed curiosity, communicate your stance on taboo topics. This is especially important for certain contexts like work, school, social events and community gatherings. Your opinion on taboo subjects can quickly spread like wildfire in such contexts, leaving you picking up the pieces in your personal and professional life.Topics like politics, religion, abortion, or your sex life should be strictly off the table in these contexts. Only share your position on such issues when you feel comfortable with those present. If you have concerns about your opinion being shared, don’t say it in the first place.

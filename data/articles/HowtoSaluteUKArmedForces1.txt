 When an officer salutes another officer in the UK Armed Forces, he is in effect saluting Her Majesty the Queen. So, if a subordinate airman salutes an officer, the officer will return the salute on behalf of the Queen., Officers in the Royal Air Force and the Army both salute the same way. When RAF and Army personnel do a hand salute, they display an open hand. They position their right hand so their fingertips almost touch the band of their hat.The RAF and the Army do not wear white gloves as part of their uniform, so they will salute with their palm facing forward.
 Taking the word “salute” literally, it is a way of offering a salutation or a greeting. In the military, you must show respect by saluting your superiors, and your superiors must reciprocate by saluting you.If you are not sure who is your superior officer based on your rank, you can use this chart here to determine who you should be saluting in the RAF and the Army. In the RAF, a Corporal will always salute an Air Marshal, for example, and in the Army a Private will always salute a Major.

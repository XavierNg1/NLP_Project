 Fruits and vegetables rich in colors like blue, purple, red, orange, yellow, and green often pack the most nutrients and antioxidants.


Among the best sources are berries, spinach, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, watermelon, cherries, broccoli, and red cabbage.;

Try a few grapes and a slice of cantaloupe with breakfast, a kiwi or apple with a sandwich of tomato and avocado for lunch, and a plate of skin-on Russet potatoes and artichoke as sides for dinner.
If you prefer only one fruit or vegetable per meal, make your morning and afternoon snacks carrot sticks, orange slices, sliced red bell pepper, or a small handful of dried plums.

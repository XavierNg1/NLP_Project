On the character select screen before starting a new run, press tab, type in this seed: JTMD EZPF, then select Isaac.
Go left after you start and let the enemies damage you until you have only a half heart of health left.
Go to the room below your starting room and die to the Mulliboom.;

Input this seed: 349W VRFT.
Go to the item room right above you and pick up Pyro, which will give you 99 bombs. These bombs should be enough to help you kill the bosses and enemies of the next two floors.
Once you reach The Caves or its alternate floor, The Catacombs, drop bombs next to yourself until you die.



Input this seed: YR8E YXDV.
The first item room will give you Polyphemus, and if you skip the devil deals that are guaranteed by The Book of Belial, you will get very strong items from Angel rooms.
Once you've worked your way through to the Depths 2 and found the boss room, lower yourself to half a heart and walk in. Mom will always stomp as her first attack.
 This is the final step in unlocking The Lost, which means you cannot use a seed. Luckily Azazel is considered by many the easiest character.


Reset your runs by holding R until you find a good first item, get rid of any black hearts, and avoid picking up items that do damage independently of you like Demon Baby or Daddy Long Legs.
Once you reach the boss fight in Sheol, die to the 2nd stage of the fight where Satan is shooting lasers and tears out of his hands while moving around the room.
 If you did everything right you'll have unlocked The Lost. Enjoy the many grueling hours it will take to get all his unlocks.

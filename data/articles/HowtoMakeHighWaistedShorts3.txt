 High waisted shorts look cute if they're distressed, so you can use pinking shears, a box cutter, or an Exacto knife horizontally across the place where you want the rips to be. You should try to create at least one distressed part on each pant leg, and try not to line them up too evenly.


Don't worry if it doesn't look natural -- once you wash your shorts, they will naturally fray and they will look like they've been distressed for years.
 If you want your shorts to be hemmed instead of looking frayed or cut-off at the end, then you can hem them. This will also help them look more even if you didn't cut them perfectly. Here's how you can easily hem your shorts:


Turn the shorts inside out.
Fold the edges up to your desired length.
Stitch the hem with a needle and thread or on a sewing machine.
 Buy some clothing dye and follow the directions on the package. Pick a fun and funky color like hot pink or lime green. Dyeing works best on lighter-colored shorts.

 You should start by reading the review carefully for constructive feedback, which is feedback that feels thoughtful, detailed, and useful to you as the creator. Go through the review and note any points that feel they may help you improve your work in the future. Ignore any points that simply state “I did not like this” or “This was bad” without providing concrete examples from your work to support these claims.You should also consider any comments in the review that may feel irrelevant. Perhaps the reviewer misses the point or does not seem to understand what you were trying to do in your artwork. Because their comments seem clueless, you may be able to simply say, “Whatever” and brush them off.
 Though it may feel tempting to respond in anger or with a witty retort to the review, not responding may be the best option. Responding to the review with a calm, patient reply may feel good in the moment, but it does not mean the reviewer has to reply or even acknowledge your reply. Not responding to the review can help you move on and focus on other reviews that may be more useful to you and your work.Try to accept the review as one person’s opinion and then move on. You can’t please everybody, especially when you are creating art, which is subjective at best.
You should also keep in mind that any publicity is good publicity, especially in the art world or the publishing world. Though the review may have been bad, it still helps you raise your profile as an artist.
 You should reach out to those closest to you and get emotional support, especially if the review hurt you on a personal level. Though you may try not to take the review personally, this is easier said than done. Lean on your peers and your mentors for support and advice. They will likely remind you that the review is just one of many and that you need to be confident enough in your work to handle reviews from others, positive and negative.

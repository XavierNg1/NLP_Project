 During a mock fight, cats will take turns being on top. In other words, both cats should spend an equal amount of time being on the bottom and top.If your cats are chasing each other, then the same rule applies. They should both be chasing each other instead of one cat chasing the other the entire time.
 Cats that are play fighting will stop and start many times. This enables them to take a break and change positions. On the other hand, cats that are fighting move at a fast pace and do not stop until one of them wins., If you are still unsure if your cats are playing or fighting, observe their behavior afterwards. Cats that are fighting will avoid each other afterwards, or at least one will avoid the other.Cats that have been playing will act friendly toward each other and resume their normal behavior afterwards.

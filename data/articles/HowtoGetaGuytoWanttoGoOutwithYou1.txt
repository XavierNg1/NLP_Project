 Before you start up a conversation, you can convey your attraction without saying a word.Don’t go overboard with actions that seem out of character. Simply improving your posture or opening up your shoulders towards him as he walks by can subtly draw attention to yourself.;
, A classic sign of attraction are fluttering eyes. It is scientifically proven that we blink more when we are excited. Subconsciously, batting your eyelashes will let him know that you are excited at his presence and he may respond in kind., If you are at a bar or together at the lunch room, move towards his direction without invading his personal space. You can be as subtle as leaning an inch closer while chatting. People subconsciously move closer to or lean towards someone or something important., Mimic his style and his sensibilities by observing his style cues and mannerisms. For example, if he dresses more conservatively, ensure that you aren’t wearing low cut tops around him. If he is more of a ball cap and tee guy, observe who his favourite team is and wear their team colors., If you have similar hobbies and interests, make sure he knows. Whether you workout at the same gym or talk about your favorite tv series, sharing interests forms an immediate bond.


Sports and athletics can be a tricky because there may be chance for injury. If you are more athletic than him, you don’t want to make him feel inadequate. Conversely, don’t force yourself to enjoy a sport that he has been playing as a child.
 Utilize the chameleon effect by copying how he moves and the idiosyncratic gestures to show that you're interested. The timing of your movements can also play a role in getting his attention. If he reaches for his drink, wait a few seconds and reach for yours. If you copy him a few beats after he has acted, he will subconsciously think that the two of you are in sync, and thus very similar.Exercise caution as you don’t want to over do it and becoming annoying or come off as a stalker.

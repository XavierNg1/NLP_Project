 Pour the protein powder into a large mixing bowl. Whisk in the baking powder and the salt. If you want to make your pancakes sweeter, add in a little bit of your favorite sugar substitute (ie: Stevia).


You can get protein powder sweetened or unsweetened. Consider getting the sweetened kind for this recipe. This way, you won't have to add extra sweetener to it.
The salt is not absolutely necessary, but it can help cut the sweetness of overly-sweet protein powder.;
, Pat down the dry mixture first, then make a well. Add the eggs, water, and oil into the well. Whisk everything together until just combined. If the mixture is still too thin, whisk in a little bit more protein powder.


You can also use an egg substitute instead.
For something more flavorful, switch out the water for a low carb milk substitute. You can also try sour cream or butter milk as well.
Consider adding in some tasty extras, such as ground cinnamon, fruit, nuts, or pieces of cooked bacon.
 Heat the pan up first. When it's hot enough to make a fleck of water sizzle, add about ¼ tablespoon of butter or oil. Spread the oil or butter around, then wipe most of it off with a paper towel.
 Use a soup ladle to measure out about ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of pancake batter and pour it onto the skillet. Depending on the size of your skillet, you may be able to fit more than one pancake, as long as they do not touch., This will only take 25 to 30 seconds. As soon as you see the bubbles, wait for them to burst, then slide a spatula under the pancake and flip it over.
 This should only take about 25 to 30 seconds. Once the pancake is cooked, slide it off the pan and onto a plate.
 You have enough batter to make 2 large pancakes or 6 small ones. Re-grease the pan if it starts to turn too dry.
 You can eat them as they are, or serve them with your favorite pancake syrup. Yogurt or sugar-free preserves are another tasty option. You can also sprinkle some sugar substitute, such as Stevia, on top.

 Unlace your shoes to expose as much of the white canvas as possible, making it easier to thoroughly clean your sneakers.

You can clean shoelaces separately by letting them soak in a bucket or basin of warm, soapy water, but know that they may never be as bright as they once were. An alternative is to replace your old shoelaces with new ones.
 Use a spot cleaning stain stick on any stained spots you wish to remove. Follow the label instructions when dabbing the stain stick cleaner onto the stain.

Note that no pre-moistening is required when using a stain stick unless the label specifically calls for it. If the label does call for it, follow the instructions provided on the label to determine how much water to use.
While specific instructions can vary, usually, you will rub the moistened tip of the stain stick over the stain on your shoe using a firm, circular motion. Extend the cleanser just outside the edge of the stain to prevent the stain from spreading outward onto clean white material.
 Place your white Converse shoes in the washing machine along with a little standard detergent. Run the machine on a full cycle using cold water.

Do not use a chlorinated bleach or detergent.
If you want to prevent your shoes from banging around in the washing machine too much, wrap them in a mesh or fabric laundry bag before before throwing them into the machine.
 Converse shoes must be allowed to air dry. To speed the process up and help further the whitening effect, place your shoes in a warm, sunny, and dry location to dry.


The dry warmth of the sun can help dry the shoes faster, and the light of the sun actually has a mild bleaching effect.
Do not use a dryer. Machine drying white Converse will result in the shoes losing their shape.

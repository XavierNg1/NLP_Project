 Since honey is so sticky, it helps to add some water to loosen it up and make it easier to apply to your hair. Mix four parts honey and one part water or apple cider vinegar (which acts as a conditioner) in a bowl until thoroughly combined.


If you want a more drastic change, you can add a few capfuls of hydrogen peroxide to the mixture. This reacts with your hair to bleach it several shades lighter. Don't use peroxide if your hair is black or very dark brown, or it may come out orange.
For a reddish-blonde hue, add some henna powder, cinnamon or ground coffee to the mixture.Adding hibiscus petals will add a strawberry blonde hue.;
,, Drape a towel over your shoulders to protect your clothes, then pour the honey mixture over your head in small doses and use your fingers to massage it in. Continue pouring honey onto your hair and working it in until all of your hair is completely covered in honey.


You might want to cover your bathroom floor with a towel or washcloth to protect it from drips, since sticky honey can be annoying to clean up.
If you added a reddening powder to the honey, don't wear clothes or use towels that might stain red.
 Use a shower cap or a few sheets of plastic wrap to cover your hair. Let the honey sit in your hair for at least 2 hours to achieve a lighter look.


If you have long hair that's hard to keep up under the plastic, twist your hair into clips to pin it up while the honey treatment is working, then put the plastic over your clipped up hair.
If you can manage to keep the honey in your hair overnight, you'll get much lighter results. It also acts as as deep conditioning treatment. Put a towel over your pillow and sleep wearing a shower cap.
There's no need to use a blow dryer to apply heat. The honey works well at room temperature.
 Rinse it out with warm water, then shampoo and condition your hair as usual. Pat your hair dry with a towel and either let it air dry or blow it out. Your hair will now be honey-colored.

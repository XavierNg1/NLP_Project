 Begin target training by placing the target in front of your cat’s nose. It should be about 2 inches (5 cm) away from the cat. Your cat should automatically look at the target. It may even move towards the target.You can put a bit of wet cat food on the end of the target to help coax your cat to touch the target., When you cat looks at the target, press the clicker and give the cat a small treat. Your cat will begin to associate the target with the treat. While your cat is eating the treat remove the target from view., Once your cat has finished its treat, present the target again. Place the target directly in front of the cat and close to its face. If the cat does not notice the target after a few seconds, remove it from view and then present it again., This time, wait until your cat touches the target with its nose and then give it a treat. Continue to practice target training by placing the target close to your cat and then giving a treat once they touch it., Once they have gotten the hang of this skill, you can place the target slightly to the left or right of your cat’s face. Similarly, you could position the target slightly above or below your cat’s eyesight. Your cat should move and follow the target.Continue to keep the target close to your cat, but position it so that it is not directly in front of your cat’s face.

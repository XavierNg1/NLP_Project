 Typically, buyers will want a good 10 inches of hair. Be sure that you are able to part with that much hair.


10 inches is the measurement of the ponytail. Don’t hold up a measuring tape and estimate based on the length of your hair. Get someone to measure your ponytail.;
, However, some colors fetch higher prices than others.


Blonde hair is the most highly sought-after, but if you have a particularly unique color, you may also find that you can charge more. Natural highlights are very popular.
 “Virgin” hair refers to hair that has never been treated. This is what most buyers like to see.


You can sell hair that has been colored as well, but hair that is damaged, frizzy, or thin will not sell very well. If you have some damage at the ends, be sure to trim it off.

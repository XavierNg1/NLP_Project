 Individual members of a family often fill certain roles; similarly, dogs like to know their position in a group., Like humans, dogs’ personalities can vary widely among individuals. Some dogs are naturally easy-going, happy, and agreeable. These dogs are often labeled “submissive.” Other dogs are higher maintenance and often experiment to see what they can get away with. These dogs are often thought of as “dominant,” but they may be more accurately thought of as badly behaved and in need of training.Dogs who seem dominant are seeing what behavior they can get away with, not challenging the authority of their owner or pack leader.
 Older theories of dog training often advised an owner to punish or physically dominate a dog to teach him his place in the “pack.” More modern theories advocate reward-based training to reinforce good behavior. In most cases, rewarding good behavior is more effective than punishing bad behavior., Your default position should be one of praising good behavior, not punishing bad behavior. However, if your dog is about to harm himself or another creature and it is happening right now, it may be appropriate to punish the dog.For example, if your dog jumps on your pet cat, you may want to give him a sharp “no!” rebuke accompanied with a loud clap to startle the dog.
Be aware of the limitations of this approach; your dog may learn to only attack the cat when you are not in the room.
Dogs do not understand punishment for behaviors that were performed in the past, even if it has only been a few minutes. Chastisement is only effective in the exact moment of the behavior.

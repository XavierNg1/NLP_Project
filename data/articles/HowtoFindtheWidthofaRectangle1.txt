 The formula is A=(l)(w){\displaystyle A=(l)(w)}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the rectangle, l{\displaystyle l} equals the length of the rectangle, and w{\displaystyle w} equals the width of the rectangle.This method will only work if you are given the area and length of the rectangle.

You might also see the formula written as A=(h)(w){\displaystyle A=(h)(w)}, where h{\displaystyle h} equals the height of the rectangle and is used instead of length.These two terms refer to the same measurement.
;
, Make sure you substitute for the correct variables.

For example, if you are trying to find the width of a rectangle that has an area of 24 square centimeters, and a length of 8 centimeters, your formula will look like this:24=8w{\displaystyle 24=8w}


, To do this, you need to divide each side of the equation by the length.

For example, in the equation 24=8w{\displaystyle 24=8w}, you would divide each side by 8.24=8w{\displaystyle 24=8w}248=8w8{\displaystyle {\frac {24}{8}}={\frac {8w}{8}}}3=w{\displaystyle 3=w}


, Donâ€™t forget to include the unit of measurement.

For example, for a rectangle with an area of 24cm2{\displaystyle 24cm^{2}} and a length of 8cm{\displaystyle 8cm}, the width would be 3cm{\displaystyle 3cm}.

 The more pages it has (and thus weight), the better. However, if all you have are fairly slim books, don’t worry. Just pull several off the shelf, or find a heavy object that can rest on top of the book without sliding off.


This method works best for extremely delicate flowers that may lose their petals in all other methods.
 Use a sheet or two of paper towels or some other material that absorbs moisture. Fold it in half. Make sure that each half will cover the flower’s head.This step isn’t strictly necessary, but it will protect your book from moisture damage and staining, as well as reduce the risk of ink bleeding off the page and staining your flower.
 First, set your flower on one half of the folder that you have made. Fold the other half over so that it lightly covers your flower. Open your book at least halfway through, preferably closer to the end. Place your folder on the open page and close the book over it.
 Set additional books or heavy objects on top of the book with the flower for extra weight. Give your flower roughly a month to dry and press. After that, crack your book open, and you should have a beautifully pressed flower inside!

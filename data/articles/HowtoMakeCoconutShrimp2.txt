, Use your fingers to remove the peel from the shrimp. You can leave the tails on if you'd like, but take off the shells and the legs. Use a knife to cut a slit down the back and the belly, then lift out the veins. Rinse the shrimp to remove the bits of shell.
 Mix the flour and spices in one bowl, the eggs and cream in another bowl, and put the coconut in a third bowl.
 One at a time, dip each shrimp in the flour mixture, the egg mixture, and the coconut mixture. Make sure each shrimp is completely coated in batter before moving to the next one.
 Grease a 9x12 glass or metal baking pan and lay the shrimp on the bottom. Make sure they aren't touching one another, or else they won't cook as evenly.
 Put the baking pan in the oven and cook the shrimp for about 10 minutes, until the top is golden brown. Remove the pan from the oven and flip the shrimp to the other side, then bake for another 10 minutes. The shrimp are ready when the second side is golden brown.









If the shrimp don't seem to be getting brown, you can use the broiler setting on your oven to cook them. Broil for 2 - 3 minutes on each side.
Don't overcook the shrimp, or they won't be as juicy. Be sure to remove them right when they're finished.
 Baked coconut shrimp are a healthy appetizer or main course. Serve them on a bed of mixed greens or with a dipping sauce such as honey mustard.

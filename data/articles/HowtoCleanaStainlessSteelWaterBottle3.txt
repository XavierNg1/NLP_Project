 Many newer stainless steel water bottles have bottoms that can be twisted off. This allows you to better access the bottom and inside of the water bottle, which might be impossible in a stainless steel water bottle that has a narrow neck and mouth., Bacteria can hide in the bevels of water bottles with narrow mouths. A wide-mouthed stainless steel water bottle will limit the curvature of the water bottleâ€™s internal surface, minimizing the surface area that bacteria prefer. Wide-mouthed bottles allow you to more easily see and access the inside of it, making cleaning easier., Not all stainless steel is created equal. There are a number of different stainless steel alloys. Before buying a stainless steel water bottle, check the tag or the bottle itself for verification that the bottle is made from stainless steel with either 18/8 or 304. These are the two food-grade stainless steel ratings.

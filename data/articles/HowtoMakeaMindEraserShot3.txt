 If you want a sweeter drink, consider replacing regular vodka with flavored vodka. Vanilla vodka in particular pairs well with coffee liqueur. You could also consider fruit-flavored vodkas, like lemon or raspberry, but keep in mind these flavors may clash with the liqueur.
 The brain eraser is similar to the mind eraser. It's a layered shot made from equal parts cinnamon schnapps, coffee liqueur, and vodka. It can be a fun festive variation for a holiday party.


Pour your ingredients into a tall shot glass to encourage mixing. Add equal parts of each ingredient.
Pour the schnapps first, as it's sweetest. Then the liqueur. Lastly, add the vodka. Remember to pour slowly to make sure the shot is layered.Drink through a straw, placed at the bottom of the shot glass. You want to experience the layers one at a time.
 Some bartenders have experimented with the mind eraser shot by switching up the ingredients. You can try using rum, molasses, bitters, and lemon juice to make a variation on the mind eraser. You should be able to find these ingredients at a typical liquor store.Add one and a half ounces of rum, which is one shot. Then add 3/4 of an ounce of coffee liquor. Add a fourth ounce of molasses, 2 dashes of bitters, and 3/4 an ounce of lemon juice. Mix the ingredients together thoroughly using a shaker. Shake for about 15 seconds.Top your drink with a splash of soda water. Pour it into a glass and enjoy., Some people enjoy adding coconut water to a mind eraser instead of soda water. This takes away some of the carbonation, but can add a sweeter taste. This is best if you're making the mind eraser with rum.If you enjoy the carbonation, consider making ice cubes out of coconut water. This can preserve the carbonated taste, while adding a bit of coconut flavor.If you're using rum and coconut, adding a dash of nutmeg on top of the drink can be fun. Sprinkle some fresh nutmeg on top of your mind eraser before drinking or serving.

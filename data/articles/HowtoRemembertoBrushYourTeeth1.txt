 Leave out your toothpaste and toothbrush so that it is more apparent to you. Make sure they are somewhere you will see during the times of day you would like to brush your teeth. Keep them in a cup by the sink in the bathroom, for instance. A brightly colored cup might help draw your attention.;
, Put post-its or other notes in places you are likely to see them. Change them routinely so that your eyes don't learn to skip them. Put one note on your bathroom mirror, and another by your bed, on your lamp, or on your kitchen table. Put a note on the back of your front door to remind yourself to brush before leaving the house.


Write something like "brush!" or draw a picture of your toothbrush.
Some toothbrushes have a clock and a timer that you can use to set alarms and measure the brushing time. This might help you to remember to brush as well.
 If you have a pocket agenda, write "brush teeth" into your daily schedule. A to-do list with items you check off could also help. If you have a wall calendar, you can put it there. Any document you are likely to refer to frequently is a good place for a reminder.
 Use an alarm clock, your phone, or your computer to set an alarm for the times of day you would like to brush your teeth. You can look up free alarm systems online. Always brush as soon as your alarm goes off, or it will lose power.
 If you live with someone, brush your teeth when they do. Ask them to brush at the same time as you, or immediately before. Observe when they brush, or have them tell you when they are going to brush their teeth so you can brush after.


Another idea may be to keep the toothbrush on one side of the sink and place the toothpaste parallel to it, but on the other side of the sink so it will draw your attention.
 Ask someone to remind you every night. If you know someone who really looks out for you, such as a parent, partner, or best friend, ask them to remind you to brush your teeth. If they live far from you, they can call you.

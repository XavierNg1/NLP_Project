 Sitting down for an extended period of time can cause extreme pain if you are suffering from a tailbone injury. If possible, avoid situations where you will be required to sit for a long time. If you must sit for work or other activities, be sure to take breaks., Taking a seat on a hard surface can complicate a tailbone injury and cause additional pain. When possible sit on cushioned surfaces like couches and padded chairs. Avoid sitting on furniture that does not have padding in the seating area.If you must sit on a hard surface, alternate sitting between the left and right sides of the buttocks.
Lean forward when sitting on a hard surface which will shift weight away from your tailbone.
 You can purchase a doughnut cushion that has a hole in the middle that prevents your tailbone from making contact with the surface upon which you are sitting. You can use the cushion at work, while driving, and at home to alleviate some of the pain associated with a tailbone injury., If the cause of your tailbone pain is a traumatic injury, such as getting hurt during a contact sport, apply ice to the tailbone area for fifteen to twenty minutes at a time. Repeat this four times per day during the first several days after the injury occurs., A tailbone injury is often accompanied with pain during bowel movements. Eating foods high in fiber like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can soften stools and make bowel movements more comfortable.Try natural over-the-counter stool softeners, such as powders made from psyllium.

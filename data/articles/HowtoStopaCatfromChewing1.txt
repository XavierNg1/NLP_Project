 A compulsion is an irresistible need to perform a certain behavior. In cat’s, the most common compulsive behaviors are wool or fabric sucking/chewing or excessive hair licking/chewing—also called psychogenic alopecia. This most often occurs when a cat is stressed or frustrated by something out of its control.In kittens that are weaned too early, this can become a problem when they become adults. Generally a kitten should not be weaned from its mother before eight weeks of age.Oriental breeds of cats are more likely to develop a compulsive chewing problem. Cats that are experiencing stress—such as moving to a new home or a new baby in the house—are also more at risk to develop a compulsive chewing problem.;
, Not all chewing is the result of a compulsive behavior. Young kittens and some adult cats may just be curious and adventurous enough to start chewing on things they shouldn’t. While it may be cute at first, this can be extremely dangerous if a kitten bites into an electrical cord or pulls a heavy object down on itself.Boredom can also cause a cat to chew., Some chewing starts as the result of a medical condition, such as fleas, allergies, food intolerance, or an unhealed wound.Dental disease or mouth sores may also cause a cat to chew on objects.Even a behavior like chewing on a plant can have an associated medical explanation. Indoor cats especially with few grasses in their diet may simply chew on plants because they’re craving greens., Before any diagnosing the reason behind any chewing behavior, your veterinarian should perform a thorough medical examination, especially on an adult cat that has recently started this behavior. Once your veterinarian has a diagnosis for the chewing behavior, then he or she will help you form a proper treatment plan.

 Women may also experience higher back pain similar to kidney tenderness. These aches may indicate that a chlamydia infection has spread from the cervix to the fallopian tubes.As the chlamydia progresses, your lower abdomen may be tender to gentle pressure.
 If you have a sore throat and have recently engaged in oral sex, you could have contracted chlamydia from your partner in this way, even if he was without symptoms.


Penis-to-mouth transmission of chlamydia is one of the possible means of transmission of this infection.
 Women with chlamydia will often develop a fever and become nauseated, particularly if the infection has already spread to the fallopian tubes.Anything higher than 37.3C or 99F is considered a fever.

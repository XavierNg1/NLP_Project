 Using your substitute is easy. Simply use it in place of one cup of "normal" Bisquick mix. Add the extra ingredients called for in the recipe, including additional oil or fat. Follow the directions for preparation as they are written â€” you shouldn't need to change them to account for the new mix.


The recipe above makes one cup of substitute mix, so it's perfect when just one person is eating. To serve multiple people, just scale the ingredients (multiply each by two, three, etc.) and follow the directions as normal.
A good source of Bisquick recipes is available here., If you're not using the Bisquick substitute right away, you can store it. Be sure to place it in a sealed, airtight container. It should keep well in the same places that Bisquick itself does: closets, pantries, etc. Stored correctly, this mix should last at least a few weeks.
 Stored in the fridge, Bisquick substitute can last up to four months. If you're making it way ahead of time, put it in an airtight container in the fridge to keep it fresh.


If you're using your Bisquick substitute fairly quickly, you shouldn't need to worry about storing the mix in the fridge unless you used butter as the fat in your mix. Butter can eventually go rancid at room temperature, so it's wise in this case to keep your mix in the fridge.

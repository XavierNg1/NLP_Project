 If you’re looking to feel more secure, but aren’t too worried about actual security, a Pit Bull (or American Pit Bull Terrier) may be perfect for you. It’s certainly true that Pit Bulls are among the scariest looking dogs - which can work wonders in keeping maleficent humans at a distance. They are also extremely affectionate, which risks an overly friendly demeanor that is not necessarily ideal for guard dogs.Pit Bulls are also very easy to adopt, as Pit Bulls are often passed over by many people who perceive them to be overly aggressive.
 Given the widespread use of German Shepherds as police and military personnel, it’s well known that this breed takes protection seriously. Often, their bark and reputation is enough to deter strangers from poking their nose where it doesn’t belong.Further, German Shepherds are extremely intelligent and will quickly warm up to those you welcome into your home.
 Doberman Pinschers were bred specifically to protect the person with whom they have the strongest bond. For a single person who wants a dog for protection, they are one of the best options. Their intelligence makes them easy to train, especially for guarding duty.Like any dog trained to guard you, Dobermans will need to be properly socialized with other dogs and people by you or a professional trainer.
While Rottweilers also excel in personal protection roles, they are also larger and can be harder to handle. This makes socialization at a young age very important.

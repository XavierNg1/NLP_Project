 If you’d like to format your message as a list of items or steps, Slack makes it easy. Start by typing the name of your list in the message box (but don’t send it yet).


For example, if you wanted to make a list of supplies necessary for a project, you may title the list “Project Needs.” On this line, you’d type: Project Needs
You create bulleted (•) or numbered lists using this method.
 Now that you typed your list name/heading, use this key combination to open a new line just beneath it. Your first list item will go on this new line., Before typing the first item in the list, type “1.”


To start with a bullet point (•) instead of a number, press Alt+8 (if you’re using a Mac).
If you’re using Windows and want to add a bullet point, hold down Alt and as you type the following key sequence: 0, 1, 4, 9

, See these examples:


1. Masking tape
• Masking tape

, Every time you want to add another line to the list, you’ll press ⇧ Shift+↵ Enter to start the next line.
 Start with “2.” or a “•” and type the name of the next item in the list. Repeat this process until you’ve entered the final item in the list.
 This will send your completed list to the team or message recipient.

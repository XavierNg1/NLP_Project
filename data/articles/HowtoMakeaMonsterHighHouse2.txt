 A shoe box is an ideal size, as long as it is large, such as at least size 13 for one doll.



Measure the box shape. Use this measurement to cut out 2 pieces of fabric slightly smaller than the box shape.
Stitch three sides of these two pieces together but leave open one end.
Stuff the fabric with quilt wadding or similar stuffing.
Stitch the last edge up and you have a mattress for the bed.



Grab any 2 sheets of fabric. Cut them down to fit the bed.
Tuck one piece of fabric over the mattress.
Use the other piece as the top sheet.
 Rest this on top of the bed.


It's a good idea to hem this piece to prevent fraying. If you don't know how, ask for help with this.
 Do the same as for making the mattress, only make the two pieces of fabric a lot smaller, pillow size for the box. Stuff and stitch up, then add to the bed.

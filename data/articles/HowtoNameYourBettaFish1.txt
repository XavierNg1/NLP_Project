 Male betta fish typically have longer fins than females. Fully grown male bettas will have long flowy fins, but female bettas have shorter, less frilly fins.Young male bettas may still have short fins, so only use fin length to determine the sex of full grown bettas.;
, Female betta fish have an egg sac on their bellies. The egg sac looks like a tiny white dot, no bigger than a grain of salt. If your fish has an egg sac, it is most likely a female.
 When a male betta fish sees another male betta fish, he flares up his fins and gills to try and intimidate the other fish. Females are less aggressive and usually won’t flare.Try putting a mirror in front of your betta to get it to flare. Quickly remove the mirror if your fish flares so it doesn’t try to charge at the other “fish”.

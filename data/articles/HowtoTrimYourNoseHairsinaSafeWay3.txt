 Ones with slanted tips and handles might be easiest to use.
 Tweezing nose hairs may be more difficult or tedious than trimming with scissors or a trimmer, and good lighting will aid this process.


Choose the hairs you want to pluck. Remember not to go overboard. Nose hairs are good for your lung health, plus they're painful to remove. Just pluck the ones visible to a person standing a reasonable distance away.



Don't give yourself time to think about it. Drawing it out, for fear of pain, actually makes it hurt worse.
This may be a little painful, so you can put a small ice cube up the nostril for about a minute if you'd like to numb the pain a bit.
Your eyes will water a bit, and your face may go a tinge red.
Be careful. Many doctors advise against tweezing because it can be dangerous, can cause bleeding, or leave small holes or gashes that can be infected easily, Wipe them antiseptic or wash with soap and water.

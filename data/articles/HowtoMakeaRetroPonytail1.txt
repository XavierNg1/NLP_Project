 To start, brush out your hair and use a comb to make a neat side part. You can part your hair on whichever side most flatters your face type. The smaller side of the side part should be about one to two inches (2.5 to 3 centimeters)., Once the side part is in place, use hair clips or hair ties to section off the smaller portion of your hair. Leave your hair sectioned off as you proceed to work with the bigger half of the side part., Use a comb to gently back brush your hair near the crown of your head. To back brush, you brush your hair from the tips to the roots to tease your hair. This adds volume and texture, giving you a retro style reflective of the big hair trends of the '80s. When you're done, spritz on some hairspray to set the style.You may also want to use bobby pins to keep your teased hair in place.
 Turn your brush upside down and use the back of your brush to work the front of your hair over your teased hair. This will make your hair look smother and create a bouffant effect near the front., You can remove the side part from the hair clips. Gather all your hair into a single ponytail. Secure it with a rubber band., Take a curling iron. Curl your ponytail into one single strand. Hold it for a couple of seconds before releasing it. You should be left with a curly pony tail with puffy hair near the front.It's a good idea to mist your hair with hairspray to set your ponytail.

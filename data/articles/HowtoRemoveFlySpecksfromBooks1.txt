 Ensure that it is clean and doesn't have any pencil or marker marks on it, as these may transfer to the book pages.

You can remove marks on the eraser by rubbing it up and down a wooden board, desk or other neutral flat object to remove the marked layers of the eraser. Once clean, it is ready to use.;

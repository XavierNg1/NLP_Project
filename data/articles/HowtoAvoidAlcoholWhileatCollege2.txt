 Not drinking doesn't mean you're not able to have fun. Binge and excessive drinking is never healthy, whatever your age, but partying is good for your soul. The objective of a party is ultimately to socialize and you can do that with a glass of Virgin Mojito or Soda in your hand.



Enjoy the dance floor. Keep your water intake up and you can rock the floor all night long.
Hold a champagne glass or similar with non-alcoholic cider in it, or a tumbler with dark soda in it. This can help you fend off unwanted offers and saves unnecessary explanations to people you hardly know.
 Most people love it when someone else pays them good attention! Although alcohol might help you unwind if you're the shy type, a clear mind allows you to make a great conversation and stay focused on whatever is the subject.
 If you have a house party with your friends, you can hit the kitchen counter and introduce them to the art of making great alcohol-free drinks that look just as cool as an ordinary cocktail. There is an infinite number you can learn to make: try your hand at a Basil Lemon Mojito Mocktail, a Ginger and Fred, a Safe Sex on the Beach, a Virgin Flirtini or a Roy Rodgers.

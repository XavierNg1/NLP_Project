 Children can get lots of physical activity in dancing to music or following sing-alongs and musical children’s videos.


If your child is capable of safe dancing, encourage him or her to dance to the radio or to CDs or DVDs.
 If your child’s chronic illness does not restrict motion, encourage your child to play with other children in regular activities as often as possible.


Playing tag, swinging, and using the slide are all effective workouts for children and can also help them build social skills with other children.
If your child’s illness does not permit rigorous play or much interaction, take your child to the park when it is less crowded and push him or her on the swing, hold your toddler up to “play” at the monkey bars, or walk through the park before having a picnic. Walking can be sufficient exercise for toddlers with restrictive illnesses.
 If your child’s mobility or strength is severely limited, make up your own play-time exercise games that your child can safely perform.


For instance, play pretend symphony conductors by waving arms to music, race to stack cardboard blocks into a building, or play a horizontal “jumping” game with a bedridden toddler to see who can push a pillow the farthest by bending and extending the legs.

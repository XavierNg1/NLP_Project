 In addition to conflict resolution with your dad, work to also tell him how grateful you are for him. If your dad feels appreciated, he is less likely to start fights with you.Say something like “Dad, thanks for always being there for me. And thanks so much for going to all of my games this season. It means a lot.”
You can tell him in person or write him a note.
 Know that your parents aren’t the only ones who can set family time; you can, as well. Suggest that you all have dinner together as a family at least twice per week. Don’t use your cell phone at all during this time. Talk about each other’s day, instead.You might even consider playing a game like Spades or trivia during dinner.
 Ask your dad to go on a walk with you around the neighborhood after dinner. This will give you some quality alone time and a chance to talk. Walk to the park to shoot some hoops or just sit and chat., You might feel that you and your dad are polar opposites, but there is probably something that you're both interested in. You might both enjoy documentaries, video games or cooking. Whatever it is, spend some time doing those things together.

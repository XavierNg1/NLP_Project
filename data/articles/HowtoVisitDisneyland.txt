 Discuss some of your other options if you're unsure. For example, get the same taste of Disney magic with other nearby Disney-themed areas like Disney's California Adventure, a sister theme park, and Downtown Disney, for dining and shopping. Other amusement parks within the vicinity include Universal Studios of Hollywood, Knott's Berry Farm, and Six Flags Magic Mountain. The Southern California landscape isn't without its wealth of rides.;
, Bring plenty of water and sunscreen, wear a hat and comfortable shoes, and bring a warm layer or raincoat in case of bad weather. Bring snacks or even a sack lunch so that you can save some money throughout the day, if you want. Make sure you have enough money for your ticket, parking, food, and any souvenirs you'll want to buy, and bring a backpack or other bag that you can firmly close to carry everything without losing it to the winds while on a roller coaster., Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure have their drawbacks. One of these drawbacks is that in order to visit, you'll either have to park in the "Mickey and Friends" parking structure or ride the ART (Anaheim Resort Transit) tram to the park. The address to the parking structure is 1313 S Disneyland Dr, Anaheim, CA 92802. The cost to park your car at this park will run you about $17 for cars, and even more for different types of vehicles.


Due to the cost, it's often advised to ride the ART tram/trolley to get to the park.
 If you have to park in the structure rather than ride the ART trolley, take the free, park-operated tram to get to the park entrance. The tram ride is about five minutes long, and trams operate from just before the park opens to just after it closes, allowing you to spend as much time as you want in the park.


The tram also offers access to Downtown Disney and its wealth of shopping and dining options.
 Do this online before you arrive at Disneyland to avoid having to wait in a long line before even entering the park. If you haven't purchased tickets online, you can do so at the booths outside the park once you get off the tram.
 Present your ticket to the people monitoring the entrance, and present any backpacks or large bags to be briefly checked by security. You can also pick up a map or list of shows and other attractions at the entrance.


Make sure to retrieve your entrance ticket and keep it safe. You will need it later to obtain fast passes for various rides.

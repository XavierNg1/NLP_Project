 Get some glittery, patterned, or decorative tape at the crafts store. Then, take as much tape as you need for your pencil, and then cut it off at the end. Start wrapping from the eraser end of the pencil, so it's easy to just take off some tape and wrap it back around when you need to sharpen.
 Think of pencil toppers like old school finger puppets. Draw or download a pic of the top half of your favorite cartoon, comic book character, or athlete. Make sure it is big enough so that a pencil top can fit inside like a finger would in a finger puppet. It is paper that you will join with tape so it needs to be about 2 1/2 times the pencils width.


Color it in with another piece of paper underneath, then cut out your coloured puppet shape. Lay them together and cover front and back in tape. Cut the tape, leaving a little boarder around the character as protection. Slip it over the pencil.
 You can use construction paper, wrapping paper, or newspaper with cutouts of characters on them. You can also print out pictures on plain white paper, or draw your own drawings on it. Cut to the size of your book jacket and tape in place, after covering with clear plastic contact paper.


Take black paper, or your favorite color of paper, and cut a rectangle in it. Under that, layer a white sheet of paper and draw eyes on it to look like a ninja face. Boys will love this.
If the girls are into frozen, make Elsa and Anna and then use Olaf or snowflakes for other things that will be easier to draw. Copy what pics you can and cut up cereal boxes or junk mail for others.
If the boys like dinosaurs, remember a green book with one great big eye is easier than the whole animal.

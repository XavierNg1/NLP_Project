 Expect to use keys A-Z/0-9/, the symbols (!$| etc), and Enter. Most commands do not check entry for upper/lowercase, so for the moment don't worry about CAPS (or cApS). Each command (and its parameters) goes on one line. Open a command line window (cmd.exe) to test the commands you want to run. Arrange your windows so you can see them both.;
, To start writing the file, most people start with @echo off as it stops each command being printed as it is processed. It reduces clutter on the user's screen.(This section does some hand-holding. If you want the finished script, jump to the next section.)




  : @echo OFF




, Remember to press enter after each command., Type:




 : echo Welcome TO the Backup Script!




, Good.,




  : echo.
, This code below gives the user a choice. Either they press F, or N, or they press Q or CTRL-Z which cancels the whole script.




 : choice /C:FNQ /N SELECT ull Backup OR ew FILES only. Press OR TO EXIT.
 If the user presses Q the program returns a "3", and goes to section "end". If they press N the program returns a "2", and goes to section "small_backup". If they press F, the program returns a "1", and goes to "full_backup". "Errorlevel" is not a error message as such, just the only way to set output from the CHOICE command.






  : IF errorlevel 3 GOTO END
  : IF errorlevel 2 GOTO small_backup
  : IF errorlevel 1 GOTO full_backup




, Type:




  : :small_backup<br>
  : echo.
  : echo.
  : echo You chose TO backup NEW FILES. Hit ANY KEY TO start OR ctrl-z TO cancel.
pause >nul
xcopy c:\mydirectory d:\mybackup /s/m/e
GOTO END
: :full_backup<br>
: echo.
: echo.
: echo You chose TO backup ALL FILES. Hit ANY KEY TO start OR ctrl-z TO cancel.



pause >nul xcopy c:\mydirectory d:\mybackup /s/e goto end

Â :end
exit

</source>


Create the directories referred to above, and copy a few small test files into the source directory ready for testing. Later you can change those directory names to suit your real <my documents="">.

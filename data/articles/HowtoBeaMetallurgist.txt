Physical metallurgy is the knowledge of the internal structure of metals. This allows people like metallurgical engineers to create new alloys.
Extractive or chemical metallurgy is about the process of separating metals from ores.
Mechanical metallurgy, or metal processing, involves improving molding techniques.
Welding engineers and metallurgical- and quality-control testing supervisors also require a strong knowledge base in metallurgy.



Science courses may include physics and chemistry.
Math courses can include analytical geometry, differential equations, calculus and linear algebra, engineering graphics and trigonometry.
If you're still in high school, join engineering clubs.



A bachelor's degree can be in metallurgy, mining science, materials science or metallurgical engineering.
Some metallurgy programs provide a work-study component or internship, which allows students to apply study in a practical work environment.
Master's degrees are common for those interested in advancement.
Continuing education is a must as the field of metallurgy is constantly changing.
,

These industries hire a large number of metallurgical engineers.

Metallurgists can also take the Civil Service exam for a job with the federal government.
A metallurgical engineer may start as a junior engineer in a company's training program.
 The most well-known associations are the American Society for Materials International; the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration; and the American Foundry Society.


Professional organizations typically require membership dues, but some employers will reimburse for these.

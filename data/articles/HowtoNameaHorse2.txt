 Many horses will receive their barn name from a shortened version of their registered name. Try different ways of shortening your foal’s registered name. Pick something that is easy to say.


For example, 'ABC A Hot Summer Night' might be shortened to Night or Summer.
 Observe his behavior to decide on possible names. Is he a bucking bronco? Does he love carrots? Don't feel limited to typical human names; horses often receive rather unique nicknames such as 007, Chubby, and BB.
 Perhaps you have a favorite movie horse that you’ve always loved (like the Horse of a Different Color in the Wizard of Oz). Run some searches on famous show horses, or horses that have played a part in history.


For instance, the horse Paul Revere rode on his midnight ride was named Brown Beauty. Sampson was the name of the tallest horse ever recorded, and Beau was John Wayne’s horse in the movie True Grit.
 Horses often gain a barn name for themselves - a nickname, for example, could result in a barn name, or a silly thing he does. Try coming up with a name that fits his personality or appearance - "Snuggles" for a friendly horse, or "Blaze" for a horse with a blaze.
 Even though they're meant for humans, you might find an interesting name for your horse there! Baby name books are another option. Most importantly, use your imagination! Don't disregard silly ideas; after all, it's your horse.

,, Tap DSi Ware to get to the games.
 Here are pros and cons of the categories:


Free-The free category will contain the Flipnote Studio and Nintendo DSi Browser. Flipnote Studio is where you can create sketchbooks, while the Nintendo DSi Browser is the internet browser, ran by Opera technology. These would be the perfect first applications to download, since they're always free and won't cost you any points! However, this article is talking about games, so you can save downloading those applications for later.
200-The 200 point category are the most basic of the applications. This article is filled with variety. Not only does it have fun and engaging games, they have practical things too, such as a Photo Clock or my Notebook.
500-The 500 point category is straying away from the practical apps, and more games.
800+-The 800+ category is the category with the funnest and the most exciting games, but cost the most. Since, you only are starting out with 1000 points, it wouldn't be smart to spend them all in one category.
, This is your last chance to change you mind. The screen will tell you the points you are about to spend, and you're ready to go!

, After everything's been downloaded, the game will appear as a package in the DSi Main Menu.
, Scroll to the last app you have in the line and you should see a wrapped package. Tap it to open and and out pops your game!

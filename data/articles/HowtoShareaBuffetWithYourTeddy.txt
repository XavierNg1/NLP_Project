 Before the event, tell your teddy where you are going and what you are going to do.;
, On the way there, remind them about table manners and being polite. Don't nag though.
 When you arrive, take your teddy to meet everyone and politely introduce him. If your teddy is a boy, ask him to shake hands/paws with each guest. Don't forget to thank the host/hostess for the food, if you are not hosting the event.
 Once the food has been prepared, let your teddy choose his own food. Watch him carefully and put back any food he is not allowed. Teddy bears can have allergies, have sensitivities to certain foods or just be on a diet.
 Be careful not to get his fur dirty.
 If your teddy burps, whisper in his ear to say 'pardon me'. Do the same if he passes wind.
 If he does, tell him to put it in the bin instead of eating it.
 If you let him go by himself he might get lost and have an accident.
 Make sure your teddy is not hurt badly, and then return outside.
 Always ask before you do so.

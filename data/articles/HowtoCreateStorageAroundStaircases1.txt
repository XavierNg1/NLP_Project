 Turn individual steps into hidden caches by replacing your staircase’s basic paneling with oversized slide-out drawers. Stair drawers are perfect for when you want to get everyday items out of the way but still keep them close at hand. Use your stair drawers to stash things like shoes, sporting equipment, pet supplies and household tools.Stair drawers have gained popularity as a creative storage solution, and can be installed in homes of almost any size.
Each drawer is the length and width of one step, giving you tons of bonus space that was formerly off-limits.;
, Build into the flat, blank wall lining a small stairwell and use it to mount sturdy shelves of various sizes. Now you’ll have a dedicated place for books, trinkets and family photos that won’t take up any additional room around your home.Have the shelves cut and arranged to your own specifications to create wall storage that matches your needs.
 With little difficulty, you can convert a section of the wall or an unused alcove at the top of the stairs to a convenient built-in cabinet. Integrated cabinets fulfill the same function as shelves, but give you more options in how to store and display your belongings.Have wall cabinets designed to blend in with the area around them.Cabinets can act as all-purpose storage or be based around a specific theme, such as preserving mementos from your wedding.

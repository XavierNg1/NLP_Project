 These lights are brighter than ambient lights, so they're meant to go along pathways. They're also easy to install because they have stakes built in, so you can just push or hammer them into the ground as needed.Lighted paths make it easier to get around outside at night. Solar-powered lights work well to illuminate pathways because you don't need a cord that could trip people up. A good option is solar-powered stake lights, which have a solar panel on each light.You should use more solar-powered lights than you would use if you were using electric lights, as they aren't quite as bright.;
, Deck lights provide ambient lighting and are easy to attach to what you already have in place. They make it easier for people to get around without tripping, much like pathway lights, plus they help people see any obstacles in the way. Just make sure you choose lights that are bright enough to illuminate the area.You could use something decorative and practical, such as a string of lantern lights.
 It's also good to include lights on stairs for safety. It's especially important to illuminate stairs that aren't obvious, such as steps down into your garden. However, adding lights to all stairs is a good idea, to help keep people from tripping and falling.Try using stake lights, mini spotlights, or even rope lights over stairs.

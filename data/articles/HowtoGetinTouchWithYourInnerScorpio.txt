 Scorpios are not happy being told what to do by others and can easily curl up and die under such a regime. They'll cope but they won't thrive and eventually, they'll explode, which isn't good for anyone. Hence, plan where you want to go and try to work or live for yourself or at least get great autonomy in all that you do.;
, Scorpios are good leaders but poor managers, meaning that they are able to provide the inspiration, the guidance, and lead the way, but they expect others to do the work and put in the effort as much as them and dislike taking the time to go over details that they expect others to know. Scorpios despise incompetency in others, which is something that a leader Scorpio should be careful not to show but should shift such a person to somewhere that they're better suited.
 Scorpios are known for restorative powers and incredible regeneration capacity. They can reinvent the wheel even after having been crushed by it. Use this spirit to get you back on the track after losing your way, and keep strong in your self belief. Draw on your stubbornness to win through.
 A Scorpio is only truly happy when they are living their passion; when others tell you that few get this chance, ignore them and strive for what makes you happy.
 A good Scorpio knows how to get out of a scrape with very little to hand. This trait is always worth cultivating.
 Scorpios are deeply loyal, to the point of not caring for large amounts of friends, preferring instead to have a smaller group of deeply trusted and intimate friendships. Cultivate this intimacy and loyalty and you will lead a happy life.

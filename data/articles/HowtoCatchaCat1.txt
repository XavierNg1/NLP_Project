 You might be able to catch your cat simply by beckoning it or calling to it. If it comes near, try picking it up. However, never try to touch an animal that seems fearful or upset, since a scared cat can quickly become violent.If yours reacts negatively when you try to pick it up, leave it alone and try later. Signs that a cat is scared or upset include:Tail held straight up and stiff
Ears folded back
Paw raised, with or without exposed claws
”Striking” with its paw
Low meowing or growling
Hissing or spitting
Hair raised on end
Arched back;
, You might also be able to catch your cat when it least expects it. Avoid staring the cat in the eye or trying to reach for it when you first see it, since these gestures can be perceived as threatening.Instead, sit somewhere quietly and calmly, and wait for your cat to jump in your lap. Then, gently grab it.
 Handling a cat when it does not want to be picked up or is scared can lead to some scratching or biting. If you are trying to catch a cat in a hurry (such as one that has suddenly run outside) just grab any towel or blanket to wrap around the cat once you find it. This will help to calm the feline, and also protect you from harm. If you have time to put on gloves and long sleeves, these can also help protect you., Once you find your cat, grasp it firmly in your hands (but without squeezing it) and pick it up. If you have a blanket or towel, throw it over the cat to slow it down, then grab the cat within the blanket and clutch it securely to your chest.


Grabbing a cat too forcefully or holding it awkwardly will make the situation much worse when you are trying to catch it. If at all possible, place one hand behind its front legs and your other hand under its hindquarters, lifting gently.Never pick your cat up by its neck or by its legs alone.

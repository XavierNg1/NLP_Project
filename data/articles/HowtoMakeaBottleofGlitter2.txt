 The idea behind this bottle is that it can either be a source of calming you by staring at it or it can be used for timing a time-out with a misbehaving toddler. Either way, it's a beautiful object to stare at., This could be a soda bottle, juice bottle or any other good bottle. It doesn't have to be plastic but if it is to be used by toddlers, plastic is safest. Adults may prefer to use glass, just ensure it is clear glass so that you can see the glitter easily., You'll need both glitter glue and ultra fine glitter as these two make for the most interesting mixture once added., Use a funnel to make this easier to do., Add another small container of the ultra fine glitter to complete the glittery look., Screw on tightly. Give the bottle a shake to check that you're happy with the outcome. If not, add more ultra fine glitter until you like the appearance., To use it, simply shake the bottle and watch the swirls that happen. Keep shaking as often as you like, but you should find it a calming experience fairly quickly.

To use for a child in time-out, shake the bottle and have them watch it until it settles. Their time-out is over when the bottle settles completely. Or, if the child knocks the bottle over or shakes it, the time-out doesn't end until the glitter has all come to a standstill.

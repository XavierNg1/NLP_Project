 Reserving time to relax and unwind, without the stress of work or extended family can improve your health and your motivation. Don't forget to schedule time for yourself.
 One of the best ways to be productive is to ensure your work time is not spent trying to juggle vacation plans, present shopping, recipes and schedules. Make a preemptive plan in November to schedule your personal life before your work life, and you may find motivation to work hard while you are at the office, so you won't have to stay late.
 You will sleep better if you don't have dozens of tasks you have to do right before work.
 This is a notorious time-killer at work. However, if you plan to spend an hour every week after or before work doing this, you are less likely to think it should be done at work.
 While holiday visits can be enjoyable, people often stay too long or drink too much. If you set a time limit, you are less likely to overindulge, or get overwhelmed by too much company.
 You may feel overwhelmed by all the cooking or baking that is planned. You can ask someone to bring a dish, eat out or get take out. Look for healthy or exotic options that aren't part of the normal holiday fare.
 Adults and children love to create things. Instead of making too many sweets, use the time to create your decorations.
 If you feel overloaded at work or home, there are usually a few people nearby who would be happy to help. Instead of overloading yourself, ask a friend or family member to cook a dish for Thanksgiving dinner or pick the kids up from school.
 You don't need to be a part of every party or planning committee you are asked to join during the holiday season. Choose carefully according to the things you enjoy and those that help you network.

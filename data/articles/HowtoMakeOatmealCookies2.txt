, Place the butter and the white and brown sugar in a bowl. Use an electric mixer to beat them together until the mixture is light and fluffy.
 Keeping the mixer running, crack in the egg and pour in the vanilla. Keep mixing until the wet batter is totally combined.
 In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, salt, baking soda and oats. Use a spoon or whisk to stir them together until they're completely incorporated.
 Start by adding 1/3 of the dry mixture to the wet mixture, and beat on low or stir with a spoon until the mixtures are combined. Do the same with the next 1/3 of the dry mixture. Add the last 1/3 and mix until the mixtures are combined and no white flour remains visible.


Don't overmix! The cookies will turn out tough. Use a wooden spoon or set your mixer to low when you combine the dry and wet ingredients.
 Dump in the full amount of chocolate chips and use a spoon to gently stir them into the batter., Use a cookie scoop or a spoon to scoop them onto a nonstick baking sheet (or a greased regular baking sheet).

 Put them in the oven and bake for 10 - 12 minutes, until they're golden brown around the edges. Remove them from the oven and allow them to cool.


If your like your cookies extra crispy, you can leave them in a little longer. Just check frequently to make sure they don't burn!

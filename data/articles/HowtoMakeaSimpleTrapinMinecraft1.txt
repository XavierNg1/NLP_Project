To obtain sand blocks, beaches and deserts are the main source for it.
To obtain gunpowder, kill a creeper (don't let it explode), ghast, or find some in chests, usually found in dungeons.;
, You get stone by mining cobblestone and smelting it in a furnace to produce some stone. Craft a stone pressure plate by placing two stone blocks next to each other in the crafting space in your inventory or a crafting table.
, Then when anyone steps on the pressure plate it will explode.
 There are lots of different ways to customize simple traps. Make sure to clean up the mess you might have caused experimenting or else it would seem to obvious what was going to happen to the victim!


Get a block of gravel or sand and put it in between the TNT and pressure plate. Don't have a sign next to the pressure plate reading, "Press for diamonds!!" It's not recommended. Only a noob would fall for that dumb trick.

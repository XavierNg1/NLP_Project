Let the degreaser sit on the stain for approximately 1-3 minutes or for the amount of time recommended in the instructions.
If you have a more ingrained stain, you can leave the degreaser on for a little longer. However, do not let the liquid dry.
For weaker stains, you can dilute the degreaser wit up to five parts water. , Wearing your chemical resistant gloves scrub at the stain vigorously with your brush. Let it sit for another 5-10 minutes. Use your hose or bucket to wash away the degreaser with water. Repeat the steps as necessary. 








Repeat the process as necessary if the stain is still there. Wait a day to see if any more oil has surfaced on the pavement. This can happen with oil stains, and you should repeat the process again if it does.

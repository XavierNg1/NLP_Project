 There are a number of ways to go about this:


Assault or murder an Argonian. This will result in a bounty if witnessed.
Fight one in the Arena.
Find a hostile Argonian in the wild, such as a marauder archer in a dungeon.
The Dark Brotherhood quest The Renegade Shadowscale entails killing an Argonian. If it has already been completed but Scar-Tail is still alive, it's possible to return to Bogwater and stab him there. Also, the Purification quest is a good start.
The Argonian at Peryite's Shrine won't fight back, due to being in the trance.
There is a cave north of Bravil called Veyond Cave which contains several Argonians.
Seed-Neeus, the owner of Northern Goods and Trade in Chorrol, is essential and will not die if attacked.;

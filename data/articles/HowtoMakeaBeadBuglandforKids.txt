Glue four beads together with a hot glue gun to make a butterfly's body. Use paper to make wings and black paint or paper to make eyes and glue them on.
Glue or paint two black eyes onto a green bead to make an aphid. Do the same to a gray bead to make a potato bug.
Use black paint and a toothpick to make little black dots on a red bead and glue/paint on eyes to make a ladybug.
 Glue on legs and googly eyes (or make eyes out of paper).
 Pour cold water over the web to cool it, then carefully peel it off. Glue the spider onto its web (this can also be made with Elmer's glue, but you'll have to wait for it to dry).
 Stick a rock into the glue while it's still hot. Wait for it to harden, then take your "lake" out of the container and place it in the shoe box.
 Fold the leaves in half to carefully cut out a hole in the middle to make them look chewed.

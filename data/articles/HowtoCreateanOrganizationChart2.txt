 Start by creating a visual of your structure, beginning with the largest parts of the organization first, such as the main departments. You could also start with the main managers, if you're using an employee-based chart. The point of this exercise is to establish a visual of what your chart needs to look like and how much information you'll want to include.
 For instance, in a large organization, including every employee is probably not feasible. Even including every sub-department may not be feasible. Make a decision about the amount of detail you're going to include., One way to design an organizational chart is like a family tree. You have the CEO in a box at the top. Underneath that, you have lines coming out to the next major departments or managers, also enclosed in boxes.This design works especially well for a hierarchical company.


On the other hand, a thought-bubble type design might work better in a less hierarchical company. If you have three equal departments with no CEO, you could connect all three departments in the design, with each department spreading out from a middle square or bubble with the name of the company in it.

 Head to Jorrvaskr, the easternmost hall in Whiterun, and talk to Farkas, one of the members of the Companions. Ask him for a job, and he will tell you to that a specific person is causing trouble in a certain place. He’ll tell you that you need to go to that place and intimidate that person to fix the problem.


The person and place you need to go to will be at random, so make sure that you pay attention to what Farkas is saying to get the full details of the quest.;
, Open your map and you’ll see that a new location has been marked with a pointer. Go to that place marked on your map to continue with your quest.
 Once you get to the place marked on your map, roam around the area and look for a non-playable character with an arrow marker on top of his or her head. An arrow marker means that this is the person you are looking for.
 Approach the person and talk to him or her. The non-playable character will speak a short dialogue, and afterwards, a speech menu will appear on the screen.


Select “Intimidate” from the speech menu, and your character will say something intimidating.
 Depending on the character you’ll have to deal with, you might need to intimidate the person more than once. Continue intimidating as necessary until the target person breaks.
 Once you’ve broken the target person, head back to Whiterun and report to Farkas to complete the Hired Muscle mission.

 A sleeveless dress can be worn in the winter with one quick alteration. During the colder months, find a sheer or see through sleeved dress. You can wear this over your sheer dress, providing you warmth as well as a new outfit.For added warmth and style, accessorize with scarves and hats.
 A long, loose dress can be worn under another outfit. Consider slipping on a thin t-shirt or even another very thin dress first. Then, pull your dress over the outfit. This adds dimension and warmth to your outfit., Some dresses are relatively warm and can be worn year round. To switch up your outfit, use your footwear. Wear different shoes based on season to make a dress work for multiple times of the year.For example, for winter you can wear warmer flats, boots, and work shoes with your dress.
During the warmer months, opt for things like sandals, light flats, and flip-flops.
 Many two in one dresses can be worn with and without tights. To switch up your look by season, wear a dress with tights during the winter. During the summer, go for stockings instead of simply go bare-legged under the tights.For example, you can match a red and black striped dress with black tights during the winter. During the summer, switch out the black tights for red stockings.

, Pick some of your more loyal friends to be in your band, and if you don't fill in all the slots (lead guitar, bass guitar, singer, drummer keyboard and rhythm guitars are opt), pick someone you know. Just make sure that they are good at their instrument.

 You're technically not a rockstar, despite your ego, until thousands of people enjoy your songs.

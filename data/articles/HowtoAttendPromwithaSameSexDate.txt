 Some people may be anxious to reveal publicly that they are LGBTQ+, and you do not want your date to be unhappy.


If you have been dating for a long time and your relationship is publicly known, this may still be an issue. Don't assume that just because most people are aware of you, your partner is completely happy with the situation.





;
, Not everyone is accepting, and some people may treat you badly because of your sexuality.


Learn some comebacks so that you can quickly respond to negativity towards you and your date. For example, if someone says something along the lines of 'But you're a girl/guy and so are they!' you could reply with sarcasm, 'Really? I thought that we were both martians!'. Keeping good humour around the negativity will make prejudiced people relax a little around you, as well as warding off any more inconsiderate comments.



'Coming out', or making others aware of your LGBTQ+ status may be a good thing to do before prom so that people who may have been rude or prejudiced otherwise would have time to prepare.
 If someone is being inconsiderate towards you and your date, remove them or yourself from the situation and carry on with your evening. You deserve a good night, and if people are spoiling it, you have the right to ignore them and keep them away from you.
 In countries such as the UK, you can't be denied anything based solely on your sexual orientation. If, for example, a teacher or an organiser tells you that you and your date can't dance together, or can't have a photograph in a romantic context that heterosexual classmates have been allowed, tell them that you know your rights and you know that they can't deny you them just because you are LGBTQ+.
 After the first five minutes, it is likely that no one will care that your date is the same gender orientation as you. If they do, it's their night that they are spoiling, not yours!

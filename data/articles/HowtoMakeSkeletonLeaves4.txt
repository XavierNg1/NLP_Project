 Outline the leaf and/or the center stem with liquid glue, then sprinkle on extra-fine scrapbooking glitter. You can also use tiny, glass seed beads or tiny rhinestones instead. Alternatively, you can draw designs onto the leaves using glitter glue.

Don't use the regular kind of glitter. It will be too chunky for this project.
 Cover your bowl or box with plastic wrap. Mix equal amounts of glue and warm water. Dip the leaves into the glue, then smooth them onto the bowl or box. Let them dry, then lift the leaves off; peel away any plastic wrap stuck to the leaves.Add a sprinkle of extra-fine glitter to the glue for some sparkle.
 You can glue the leaves to cards and scrapbooking paper using a glue stick. You can also paint the back of the leaf with a thin layer of liquid glue, and stick it to the project instead.For a fancier touch, use a shaped hole puncher or a craft blade to use an interesting shape (ie: heart, star, moon, etc) out of the middle of the leaf.You can also use the leaves to make prints instead. Paint the back with watercolor, press them against paper, then peel them away.
 Wipe the glass object with rubbing alcohol first. Paint it with glossy decoupage glue (ie: Mod Podge). Apply a thin layer of decoupage glue onto the back of the leaf, then paint it onto the glass object. Coat the leaf with a final layer of decoupage glue., Thread the leaves right through the joint where the center stem meets the base stem. You can even make several garlands, then hang them from vertically to create a backdrop.

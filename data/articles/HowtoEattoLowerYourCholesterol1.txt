 The first step to lowering your cholesterol through food is to start basing your diet on whole foods and limiting the consumption of processed foods. This means eating foods that have been minimally processed or not processed at all.


Eat whole grains like brown rice or whole wheat pasta, oats and barley.
Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Apples, grapes, strawberries and citrus fruits are rich in soluble fiber called pectin that lowers cholesterol.Try making a smoothie each morning to get the recommended five to seven servings each day.
Stick to lean, unprocessed meats. For example, choose chicken breast over a hot dog.;
, Adopting new food practices means taking some time to plan for meals and then shop for the necessary ingredients. Set aside 30 minutes each week to plan your meals.


Try making a master list of healthy and easy weeknight dinners. When you sit down each week to meal plan, you can draw from this list.
Ask your family to help with meal planning. Let them look over your master list and make suggestions for the week ahead.
 Whenever possible, cook your own meals or eat foods you have previously prepared at home. This will give you control over the ingredients and allow you to make healthy food choices.


Prepare foods ahead of time like chopped raw vegetables, grilled chicken breasts, or brown rice. These can easily be turned into a variety of whole foods-based meals during the week.
Try making rice bowls for an easy weeknight dinner. Top bowls of brown rice with your favorite meats, vegetables, and seasonings. Try brown rice topped with grilled chicken, black beans, veggies and salsa. You can even make the rice and grill the chicken ahead of time.

If you do not already have an account, Uber often offers promotional rides to new users. These offers can be viewed at https://www.uber.com/promo/.
 This button is in the upper left corner and will open the menu.
 You will be taken to the Free Rides page with your personal invite code displayed.
 A window will appear with various sharing options. Among the options for sharing your personal code are text message, email, social media, or copying to the clipboard.
 Selecting an option will generate a preformatted message to send to selected contacts.
 Your contact will receive a message with a sign up link and your invite code to receive a credit to make their first ride free.


Keep in mind the person using your invite code cannot already be an Uber user for the referral to work.
 Once your contact signs up for an account and completes their first ride, you will receive a 20 dollar promotional credit in your “Promotions” menu.

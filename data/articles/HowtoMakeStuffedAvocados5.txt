 Wash 2 avocados and slice them in half lengthwise. Pop out the pits and discard them. Use a large spoon to scoop the avocado halves out of the peels. Place the avocado flesh on a cutting board and dice them into small bites. Set the avocado aside.Keep the empty avocado halves on your work space. You'll fill these with the chicken salad.
 Get out one cooked rotisserie chicken and remove enough meat to make about 2 cups (250 g). Use your fingers or a couple of forks to shred the chicken. Place the chicken in a mixing bowl. Peel one red onion and use a knife to mince a little of the onion. You should get enough minced onion to make 1/4 cup (40 g).Consider chilling the rotisserie chicken before you make the salad. This will help to keep the salad cold.
 Stir 1/3 cup (77 g) of mayonnaise into the mixing bowl with the chicken and onion. You'll also need to stir in 2 tablespoons of Greek yogurt, the juice from one lemon, 1 1/2 teaspoons of Dijon mustard, and kosher salt and ground pepper to taste. Stir in the diced avocado.You could also add in chopped grapes or diced apple for a slightly sweet flavor. You can also add chopped pecans or walnuts for extra crunch.
 Divide the chicken salad filling among the four avocado halves. You can use a spoon or a cookie scoop to fill the avocados. Sprinkle the stuffed avocados with chopped fresh parsley and serve the avocados immediately.Consider serving the stuffed avocados with baked pita chips or a green salad.

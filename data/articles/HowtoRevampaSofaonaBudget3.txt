 Sometimes your sofa may simply need a good cleaning! Additionally, you should always clean your sofa before covering it. You can purchase commercial upholstery cleaning products at most stores, however, you may already have some great products at home. You will also need a vacuum cleaner, and a steam-cleaning vacuum is optional.Baby wipes are ideal for both spot cleaning and wiping down hard surfaces.
White vinegar can help to lift out stains.
Laundry detergent can be mixed with warm water to make an effective cleansing solution. If you don’t have laundry detergent, you can substitute a mild dish soap.
 Use a vacuum to remove dirt, large particles, pet fur, and lint from your sofa. Be sure to remove all pillows and cushions and vacuum underneath. You may want to do several passes to get the couch as clean as possible.You may want to use a bristle brush to help loosen any stuck on particles.
 Using a baby wipe, try to remove any surface stains or dried on substances. Also, be sure to wipe down any hard surfaces, such as legs or wooden frames., Mix 4-6 cups of warm water with ¼ cup laundry detergent and a splash (approximately 1-2 Tbs.) of white vinegar. Then, using a course washcloth or soft-bristle brush, apply small amounts of this detergent mix and scrub your sofa clean. Use the detergent as sparingly as you can, as not to over-saturate the sofa.If you have a steam cleaner, you can use it to suck up dirt and water to create an even deeper clean.
It is always a good idea to do a small “spot test” before applying detergent to your sofa.
If your sofa is leather, avoid using water. Instead, opt for a commercial leather cleaner.
 The final step in cleaning your sofa is simply to allow it to dry. You can use a hair-dryer to accelerate this process, but the best method is really just to leave your sofa alone for 4-6 hours until it is completely dry.If you have a steam cleaner, this will help remove excess moisture and speed up the drying process.

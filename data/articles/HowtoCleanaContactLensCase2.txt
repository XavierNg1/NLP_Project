 Using a clean, lint-free rag or a washed finger, gently rub inside the case wells to dislodge any biofilm that may be stuck to the plastic. To achieve maximum cleanliness, try to cover all interior surfaces of the case and spend at least five seconds rubbing each area., Get out your bottle of multi-purpose contact solution and gently spray into the open case. Continue until you are satisfied that any debris have been removed. Don’t forget to spray solution onto the underside of the lids as well.


Spraying is a critical step in bacteria prevention. One study reported that 70% of contact cases contained bacteria and other contaminants.Make sure to use the multi-purpose solution that your doctor suggested. Using a standard saline solution or wetting solution will not sanitize your case properly., As a general rule, you want to keep your contacts and your contact case away from all types of water. Do not rinse your case out with water. Doing so could potentially expose you to Acanthamoeba keratitis, an eye infection that can lead to blindness., After you’ve completed the rinsing process, set out a clean tissue or a clean lint-free cloth. Place the case and lid caps on the tissue. Place them either facing up or down, depending on your preference. Some argue that face down is better as it protects the case from airborne contaminants, like those commonly found in a bathroom., When your case is completely dry, you can then refill it with fresh contact solution. It is ready to store your contacts at this point.
 Consider carefully where you place your contact case during all phases of use. Cases are more likely to be exposed to bacteria in humid environments. Leaving your case in a bathroom, and near a toilet in particular, may cause it to come into contact with contaminated water droplets. You may want to consider a nightstand as an alternative storage option.

You will need to place baking weights or some other weights on the corner of the cookie sheet to keep the parchment paper from curling while you bake.
If you donâ€™t have baking weights, then scrap the parchment paper and coat the sheet with a bit of butter.
Since this recipe makes 3 dozen cookies, you will have to reuse the same cookie sheet three times unless you have more than one, and all of them fit comfortably in your oven.;
, Use either a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or a handheld mixer.
 When all of the ingredients are well-combined, turn off the mixer. Make sure to turn off the mixer while the blades are still in the dough. This will keep you from spraying dough all over your countertop.

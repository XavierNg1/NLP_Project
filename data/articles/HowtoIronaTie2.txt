 If you want to avoid the iron, hang your tie in the bathroom as you shower. The steam should soften the fibers to help reduce wrinkles., Try rolling up your tie, and then lay it in a clean space with the flat side down for a couple of hours. Then, unroll your tie, and the wrinkles may have released., It may be tempting to loosen your tie, slip it off, and throw it on the dresser while you go relax. Try not to do this because this will cause major wrinkles, kinks, and maybe even permanent damage to your tie. Always undo your tie completely, and then hang it up on a rack, or lay it out flat when you are not wearing it.

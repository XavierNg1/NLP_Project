 In some cases of depression, a doctor may prescribe medication. You and your partner should discuss all treatment options with a medical doctor and/or mental health professional. If you decide medication is appropriate for you, follow all instructions and consult your doctor before you stop taking the medication. Suddenly stopping some medications can be dangerous and may increase the risk of suicide.If your partner is prescribed medication, encourage him or her to take it regularly and avoid stigmatizing the use of prescribed medication. If your partner is made to feel shame regarding the need for medication, s/he will be less likely to comply with treatment.
 Both couple's counseling and individual therapy would be beneficial. Couple's counseling will help you to address issues in the relationship together. Individual therapy would benefit the depressed partner by allowing her or him to focus on healing, without immediate concern for the other, and help the non depressed partner develop healthy coping strategies for dealing with other's depression.

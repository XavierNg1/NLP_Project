 Add the baking soda and hot water into a container and then stir thoroughly, until the baking soda has completely dissolved. Set aside to let it cool.
,,, After you're done mixing, the combination should be somewhat liquid, but thick.
 Make sure the water is cool - you'll be sticking your hands in it, so you don't want to burn yourself.
 If you don't want to get your hands wet, you can use the tool you used to mix the slime.
 You can use the bowl you used for making the glue mixture to store the baking soda solution, if you wish.
 Remove it from the container and have fun stretching it, kneading it, and squishing it. Store in a plastic bag or airtight container when finished.

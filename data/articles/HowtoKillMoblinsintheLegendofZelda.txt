 Unsheathe your sword and have your shield ready by your side. Moblins only have average speed, but having your main character ready for offense is still helpful.
 Moblins are commonly equipped with a bow and arrow, a sword, or a spear. They will attack you once you come in their line of sight. To deflect their attacks, all you need to do is to use your shield. That’s it. Their arrows or sword/spear attacks will fall on your shield, leaving you unharmed.

Moblins don’t use any special type of sword or spear attacks, just hack and slash, so it’s very easy to deflect.
 If you don’t have a shield yet (you can encounter Moblins even at the very start of the game before some of the items you need, like your shield, are given to you), you can avoid their attacks by simply jumping out of their way.

Once you see that the Moblin is about to slash you or shoot an arrow at you, simply sidestep to your left or right side, and you’ll be able to dodge their attacks easily.
 After attacking, Moblins will drop their guards and will need a few seconds to get back to position; this is your time to do a counterattack. Using your sword, hack away at the unguarded Moblin to kill it.

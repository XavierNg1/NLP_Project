 Even if you are a male cosplaying as a male character, adding on a little bit of foundation, eyeshadow, and powder can help take your cosplay to the next level and make it look more professional. It will also help make it more photogenic too.You can save things like contouring and nude or brown-colored lipstick for last, but you should at least have your foundation, eyeshadow, and powder on.
 Use a small, angled brush to do this. Follow your upper lash line, then extend the eyeshadow just past your outer corner. Apply this extension with an angled brush, and match the angle to your lower lash line., Alternatively, you can do this step using black eyeliner pencil instead, and then smudge it with a sponge applicator.If you are playing a younger character, omit this step, as you will be doing your lower lashes a little differently.
 Once again, follow the angle of your lower lash line, and be sure to fill in any gaps. This will help create that single "lash" shape that male anime characters have.
, Starting at the tear duct area, apply black eyeliner to your lower lashes. Use an eyeshadow sponge applicator to help soften the liner at the outer corner. For a younger character, use liquid liner, and omit smudging it.


For a more youthful and stylized look: start at your tear duct, and follow your waterline halfway. Angle the line downward, just below your lashes, and make it connect with your upper liner. Fill in the gaps with more white eyeliner, blending it with the white liner in your waterline., Mascara is typically associated with boys and not girls, but it will help make your eyes appear larger and give them that thick, anime look.

 You will need cornstarch, corn syrup, vinegar and cold water. You will need a saucepan to heat the glue and a spoon to mix it with.
 Mix ingredients together in a small saucepan. Turn the heat up to medium heat and bring the mixture to a full boil.
 While the water is heating up, mix the remaining ¼ to ¾ cup water with 2 tablespoons cornstarch and blend thoroughly.
 When the water is boiling, carefully mix in the cornstarch paste, stirring constantly until the mixture boils.









Cook for a minute at a boil, then remove from heat. Don’t let the mixture boil to long or burn. Stir the mixture with a spoon constantly while it boils.
 When the mixture has cooled, pour into a sealable container, and store it in the refrigerator. This glue will keep for 2 to 4 weeks in the refrigerator.









The glue may work better if you let it stand overnight before using.

 In many states, you can choose a company, called an energy supplier, instead of your utility to supply your power. Just like how you can choose your own cell phone company. Your bills would still come from your utility since the utility owns the power lines to your house, but the actual cost for your power is under your control. There are comparison websites where you can see several options for lower electricity rates per kilowatt hour with multiple energy suppliers and sign up within minutes. Be sure to read the fine print as some contracts have hidden fees or have a rate spike after the end of the contract term. You can research on your utility's website and the internet to find reputable companies to choose from.

 You can use a standard hot water cycle in your washing machine or you can boil the jeans in hot water. The former will allow you to wash your jeans as you shrink them, while the latter will be quicker.









The boiling method is also slightly more flexible. If you only wanted to shrink a portion of your jeans, like the legs or waistband, you could submerge that portion only under the boiling water. Hold it in place using tongs.
If using the washing machine method, add detergent and liquid fabric softener as usual.
Make sure that the water is as hot as possible for either method.
 Throw your jeans into the dryer and dry until they are damp but not soaked. Set the dryer on its highest heat setting.









This is especially important if you used boiling water or if your washing machine did not put your jeans through a spin cycle. Your jeans should still be wet, but not dripping wet.
 Place your damp jeans on the ironing board and iron until the fabric is completely dry.









Use a moderate heat setting.
Note that this may not shrink the jeans as much as some of the other methods described, but it can be effective if you only need a slight adjustment.

 Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms that can live under extreme conditions. Some bacteria have been found in the hot springs in Yellowstone National park where the water is near boiling temperatures and also deep inside the ice in Antarctica., Bacteria require certain nutrients to survive and multiply or some may hibernate until the right conditions arrive. Many bacteria cling to sugars and starches that are found in most organic matter, which is why bacteria are often found in food. Bacteria will multiply or make copies of themselves under the right conditions, so it is important to prevent these conditions when you can.Biofilms on surfaces such as toilets or sinks can also support bacterial growth.

 Which formula you use will depend on which measurement you are given. If you are given the area, set up the area formula. If you are given the perimeter, set up the perimeter formula.

If you do not know the area or the perimeter, or the relationship between the length and the width, you cannot use this method.

The formula for area is A=(l)(w){\displaystyle A=(l)(w)}.

The formula for perimeter is P=2l+2w{\displaystyle P=2l+2w}.

For example, you might know that the area of a rectangle is 24 square centimeters, so you would set up the formula for area of a rectangle.
 Write your expression in terms of what l{\displaystyle l} equals.

The relationship might be given by stating how many times bigger one side is than the other, or how many units more or less it is.

For example, you might know that the length is five centimeters longer than the width. Your expression for the length is then l=w+5{\displaystyle l=w+5}.
 Your formula should now only contain the variable w{\displaystyle w}, which means you can solve for the width.

For example, if you know that area is 24 square centimeters, and that l=w+5{\displaystyle l=w+5}, your formula will look like this:A=(l)(w){\displaystyle A=(l)(w)}24=(w+5)(w){\displaystyle 24=(w+5)(w)}


, Your simplified equation might take on various forms, depending on the relationship between the length and the width, and depending on whether you are working with area or perimeter.Think about setting up an equation that allows you to solve for w{\displaystyle w} in the simplest way.

For example, you can simplify 24=(w+5)(w){\displaystyle 24=(w+5)(w)} to 0=w2+5w−24{\displaystyle 0=w^{2}+5w-24}.
 Again, how you solve for w{\displaystyle w} will depend on your simplified equation. Use the basic rules of algebra and geometry to solve.

You might need to use addition or division to solve, or you might need to factor a quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula to solve.For example, 0=w2+5w−24{\displaystyle 0=w^{2}+5w-24} can be factored as follows:0=w2+5w−24{\displaystyle 0=w^{2}+5w-24}0=(w+8)(w−3){\displaystyle 0=(w+8)(w-3)}You will then have two possible solutions for w{\displaystyle w}:  w=3{\displaystyle w=3} or w=−8{\displaystyle w=-8}. Since a rectangle cannot have a negative width, you can eliminate -8. So your solution is w=3{\displaystyle w=3}.

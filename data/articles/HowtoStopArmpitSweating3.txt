 Axillary hyperhidrosis is the clinical name for excessive sweating, and various treatment options available, with consultation from your general practitioner. It's likely that you'll first be recommended specific aluminum-based topical treatments, but there are a variety of other more aggressive treatments available, if the situation is severe.


In some cases, an oral anticholinergic such as Rubinol will be recommended, which helps to curb sweating, particularly in the underarms.
Talk to your doctor about onabotulinumtoxina injections. This treatment method is minimally invasive, and supposedly effective, offering an average efficacy rate of six-eight months.
 This type of electrotherapy involves, typically, two to four 20-minute sessions per week. Water is used to conduct a small electric current on your skin, which can help to reduce sweating for several weeks or months. While the treatment has mixed results and is somewhat uncomfortable, it's effective in some cases.
 This treatment uses a small endoscopic instrument that is inserted below the armpit to interrupt the sympathetic nerves that cause you to sweat. This treatment is effective, but risky, with side effects that include complications in breathing, nerve damage and/or causing other parts of your body to sweat excessively.
 Theoretically, Botox injections can and have been used to control underarm sweat for up to six months, with limited success reported among some people. This should only be considered if you have a problem with severe underarm sweating as treatments can run from $700, and they can be very painful.


There's no proven medical link between Botox and sweating, and it's not generally recommended to seek this as treatment by the medical community. Still, it's used by some.

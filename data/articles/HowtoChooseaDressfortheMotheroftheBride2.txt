 You should not choose a dress that is the same color, or a very similar color, to the bridesmaids dresses. You want some variation so you will stand apart slightly from the crowd. However, you do not want to draw attention away from the bride. Pick something that fits with the color scheme, but is not too similar to the bridesmaids dresses.For example, if bridesmaids are dressed in a deep purple shade, a lavender dress can be an appropriate option.
If there is another mother of the bride, you may want to consult with her as well.
 A solid colored dress can be appropriate, but you can also opt for patterns. This can be something to set you apart from the wedding party. If bridesmaids dresses are a single color, for example, you can wear a striped or polka dot dress.Make sure to take color into consideration as well when choosing a pattern. Choose colors that match with the wedding party's color scheme.
 The mother of the groom, or the mother of the other bride, will likely be choosing a dress as well. It's a good idea to coordinate outfits. You do not have to wear the same attire, but you may want their dresses to have a few things in common. For example, you could agree to wear dresses with a similar cut, pattern, or style., Length depends heavily on the wedding's general atmosphere and theme. Usually, longer dresses and skirts work best for weddings after noon. For morning weddings, select something shorter.However, keep in mind there are no hard and fast rules. You want something that makes you feel comfortable and matches the wedding's atmosphere. For example, do not feel you have to select a longer dress for a very casual wedding that happens to take place later in the day.

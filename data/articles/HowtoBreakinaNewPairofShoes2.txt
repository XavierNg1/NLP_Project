 Make sure the bags are big enough so that they'll put pressure on the shoe when they expand in the freezer.









When you seal the plastic bag up, remove any air from the inside of the bag. This will make it easier to "mold" the water inside the bag to the contour of your shoe.
This method will involve placing your shoes in the freezer for an extended period of time, during which time they may get wet. Be sure that the shoes you are using with this method aren't irreplaceable or susceptible to water damage.
 Make sure that the seal is tightly locked. You don't want your shoes covered in ice when you remove them from the freezer.
 Your shoes should contain a smaller plastic bag inside the cavity and a larger one protecting it from outside moisture.
 When the water inside the shoe freezes, it expands, putting pressure on the cavity in the shoe and breaking them in. The advantage of using water as opposed to a shoe stretcher is that the water will adjust to the contours of the inside of your shoe perfectly.
 The water filled baggies should now be solid ice.
 You may have to wait a few minutes in order to slide them out easier.
 Once the shoes have warmed up a bit, try walking in them and even running and jogging in them if they are athletic shoes.









Your new shoes should now be broken in and even expanded a little, and a lot more comfortable!

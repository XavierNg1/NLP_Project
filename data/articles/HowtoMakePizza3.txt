Sliced mushrooms of any kind
Sliced red and green bell peppers
Sliced onions
Sliced black olives
Sliced pepperonis
Sausage pieces
Diced ham
Mozzarella cheese

Spinach leaves
Chopped kale
Sliced beets
Roasted garlic
Green olives
Goat cheese
Fresh mozzarella slices

, This type of pizza is beloved by some and hated by others because of its strange but interesting ingredients list. If you're a fan of sweet and salty toppings, Hawaiian pizza can't be beat. Gather these ingredients:

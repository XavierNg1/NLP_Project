, Tell them why you feel so weak, maybe see what they have to say about your situation.
 Understand that you are human; you are not perfect. Anyone you think is perfect isn't. Anyone you know who says they're perfect isn't. Understand that perfection is an opinion, there is no absolute meaning.
 If you feel you lack physical strength then try working out, and if you're old enough then join a gym. Physical activity is a great self confidence booster and has tons of health benefits. Physical activity will reduce stress, allow you to sleep better, and help you feel energized and positive. Likewise, you will be developing a talent/skill that you can be proud of. Remember, physical activity ranges from archery to dodgeball to water polo. Try out all sorts of things to find what suits you best!

, Join a club, meet new people, and develop new interests. This will keep you from having enough time to be depressed about your inferiority complex. If you feel inferior because your not doing well in school, join a tutoring program and get a tutor to help you boost your marks and your self-esteem.
 Don't let good things in life pass you by because you didn't speak up, and remember to think positive, don't focus on your mistakes. You have opinions and they are valuable. If people neglect to acknowledge the value of your opinions they are not worth your worry.
, Stand your ground; your opinion is just as important as theirs.
 Tell someone you care about that you are feeling down and inferior, and they will help you understand your feelings and look at life more optimistically.
 Have fun and be happy. Happiness and company will make you forget about your insecurities and you'll be more confident around the people that understand your situation.

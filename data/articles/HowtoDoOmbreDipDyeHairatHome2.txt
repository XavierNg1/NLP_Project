 This really helps you get even color in each strand.
 Start at the tip and go about 3 inches (7.6Â cm) up. You can use either the applicator brush or your hand, if you want more natural transition you can use your hand, but if you prefer using the brush just use it. Just remember, don't leave a blunt or harsh line!

, After you are done applying the bleach, wrap the strand in foil and FOLD it. Remember, hair needs to breath -- if you crumple the foil, your hair can't breathe and it will damage your hair. When you are done with the bottom section, repeat the process until all your hair is done, leaving your bangs only.
 This step is optional! But if you have long bangs, you can add some highlights that will frame your face by adding some bleach to the tips only. If you have short/medium bangs, you can just leave them since they will blend with the dark roots of the rest of your hair.
 Everyone's hair is different, so make sure you do a strand test to see how long it takes for your hair to lighten. It will usually be in the ballpark of 15 minutes. Always check the time and don't ever forget to check it regularly.

Reel up the slack on your line so that there is a bow in your rod.
When a fish strikes or your wish to bring up your line, take your rod from the holder. Give it a swift jerk upwards to free the line from the release clip.
With a manual system, you will have to crank the cannonball up with one hand while you fight the fish with the other (unless you are with someone else). With a motorized system, you just flip the switch. You can fight the fish with both hands while you wait for the cannonball to reach the surface.

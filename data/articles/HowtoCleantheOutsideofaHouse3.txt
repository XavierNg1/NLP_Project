 Nozzles are typically measured in degrees. The spray is stronger the lower you go in degrees. Choose a low setting if you aren’t familiar with pressure washing. A 40-degree angle is good to start with. You can gradually work down to a 25-degree angle if the 40-degree nozzle isn’t getting the job done., Pressure washing can do damage to a house, especially if the material the house is made of is weak or has weakened. Spray the pressure washer on a small, hidden part of the house. Switch to a garden hose or call in a professional if you see any damage done by the pressure washer., Begin pressure washing by spraying at a downward angle. Spraying at an upward angle can cause water to get trapped in the cracks or seams, which can cause damage to your house later on., Hold the pressure washer steadily as you pressure wash. Move the pressure washer from side-to-side in a sweeping motion. You should still be holding the pressure washer at a downward angle. Continue until you have cleaned all of the outside of the house.Do not stop at one spot when using the pressure washer—always continue moving. Stopping in one place can cause damage.
 Water alone should typically be enough to pressure wash the house, but you will need to wash in a different motion if you’re using a cleaner. Spray from top to bottom if you’re using a cleaner. Rinse off the cleanser with water when you are finished pressure washing.

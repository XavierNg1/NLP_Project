 It will make it easier to make your sauce quickly if you have everything on hand. You will need the following: Butter
8oz sliced mushrooms
1 finely diced shallot
3/4 cup beef stock
Fresh herbs

, Do this in a large skillet big enough that the mushrooms can be spread out in a single layer. Don't do this on too high a heat or the butter will start to brown.
Keep an eye on the melting butter, making sure it coats the bottom of the pan.
When the butter stops foaming it is hot enough to add other ingredients.
 Make sure the mushrooms aren't too crowded in the pan. Saut√© the mushrooms until they are golden and soft.
Take care not to burn the shallots. Their flavor is very delicate.
Turn the heat to medium/high.
Add 3/4 cup of beef stock and simmer rapidly for 5 minutes. This make your sauce thicken.
Simmer at medium to low heat.
Stir the sauce occasionally to keep bits from sticking to the pan.
Watch it carefully to see that it doesn't boil over.
 Stir in 1 tablespoon butter and fresh herbs to your preference. You can add thyme or tarragon as a nice complementary seasoning to your mushrooms. Chives or basil are also good choices.
Stir thoroughly so that the butter and herbs are well mixed into your sauce.
Spoon the sauce over your dish while it is still hot. It will go well with chicken, beef, or even pasta dishes.

 When you want to remove the skin from a chicken breast, place the breast on a clean cutting board so the skin side is facing up. Choose one side of the breast and take hold of the skin to carefully pull it away from the meat.Don’t worry if the skin doesn’t pull off in one piece. Just grab the remaining piece and tug until all of the skin is removed from the breast.
 To skin a chicken thigh, it’s important to start at the joint where the skin is usually most strongly attached. Grab the skin right where it connects to the joint and pull it off in one piece. If you meet any resistance along the way, use a sharp knife to cut the skin free.If you feel like your fingers on slipping on the slick skin, you can use a paper towel to grab it and get better traction. Dipping your fingers in salt can also help, but be sure to pour the salt into a small dish and throw the remainder away after use so you don’t contaminate your salt with bacteria from the raw chicken.
 When you’re removing the skin from a chicken drumstick, you should take hold of the meaty end, not the bone. With a firm grip on the skin, pull down toward the bone until it comes off the end. It should come off in one piece, but if the skin tears, just grab the remainder and pull it off the end.If any small bits of skin get stuck along the bone and you want to remove them, use a small knife to carefully scrape them off.

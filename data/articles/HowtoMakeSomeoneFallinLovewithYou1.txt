Make sure that your personality shines through and he/her knows about your likes and dislikes. Being passionate about something is very attractive and others will take notice.
Be proud of your accomplishments and confident in your abilities. Confidence is something that people admire, so don’t be shy about what you have accomplished., Treat others the way you want to be treated. It may sound cheesy, but it's true. If you want others to treat you with care and respect, you should start treating others this way, too. People are more likely to fall in love with other people who have great personalities, who are polite, and who are kind to others., Let him or her see how far you’ve come. For example, if you are fit and active now, but you used to be a couch potato, tell the person about your transformation.

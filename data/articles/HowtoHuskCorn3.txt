 Peel the tops of the leaves away from the ear’s tip. Stop once you can see the first couple rows of kernels. If they look nice and plump, you’re good to go. However, with this method, bear in mind that:Once you expose the kernels, their sugars will start turning to starch much sooner, which means they’ll lose their freshness that much quicker.
For that very reason, this practice is frowned upon in farmers’ market, since any ears that you discard can’t be re-husked to retain freshness.
 Inspect the husk’s leaves. Pay particular attention towards the ear’s top. Check for any holes that have been created by worms.Holes may be tiny and hard to spot, but the leaves should have begun turning brown around them, which makes spotting them easier.
 Look over both the husk’s outer leaves and the silken tassel poking out from its tip. Favor husks with bright green leaves. Go for tassels that are still brownish in color, as opposed to black.The leaves’ and tassel’s coloring both indicate how moist the corn is. The more moisture it has, the fresher it is.
 If you’re not sure about coloring, feel each ear in your hand. Avoid husks with leaves that feel loose. Favor tassels that still feel sticky, which indicates moisture.Depending on how thick the husk is, you may also be able to feel the shape of the kernels through the leaves. If you can, also feel for any gaps that may indicate missing or shrivelled kernels.

 The major ones include Screenium and iShowU. Others exist that have been made by companies making products for Macs. iShowU is an alternative Screenium, while Screenium can be better than iShowU; it's up to you to take your pick. And also, you need to register it to get out of the demo, although, if you want to, it is possible to use it for free (look at Tips section).;
, iShowU and Screenium requires payment for the screen recorders to get out of the demo, but if you don't want to, you don't have to, but you can record only 30 seconds. After you purchase it, now, enter the registration key, you get from purchasing.
 These include:

Fixed Area - Chooses the area you want to record with.






Fullscreen - Records the whole entire Mac screen.






Mouse Area - Records your mouse cursor, close-up!






Single Window - Choose the window you want to record with, not multiple windows at a time!







, But, you don't have to check them if you want to make your video silent.

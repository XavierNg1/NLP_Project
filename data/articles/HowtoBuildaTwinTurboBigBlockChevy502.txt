 Re-clearance the rotation assembly - extra clearance in the bearings for additional crank flex, and open up the ring gaps for the additional heat of the turbocharger.;
, For an old school 800hp setup - a pair of T04B V1/V2 compressors, P trim turbine with about a 1.2A/R is a good start. For a more modern setup, a pair of GT4094's would be a powerful combo with low RPM spool up.
 A boost referenced FPR is a must. I would use either a Racepumps mechanical pump, Aeromotive, Holley Performance Products or similar. Blow through carb, fuel injection, will both work. CSU makes a nice Blowthrough carb setup.
 Keep the timing low to avoid detonation. Tune it for whatever fuel you will be running most of the time. A wideband 02 monitor is a must.

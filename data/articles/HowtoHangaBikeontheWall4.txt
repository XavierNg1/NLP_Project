 The curvature of an old pair of handlebars makes it perfect for holding onto your bike, and it looks great too. You can usually pick up old drop bars at your local bike coop, off a beat-up bike in a garage sale or resell store, or at a scrap yard.

To prevent the rack from scratching your bike, wrap it in handlebar tape, or another soft material. Duct tape can work in a pinch, and some people have used an old bike tube as well., A bike stem is simply the part that attaches your bars to the bike frame. Quill stems come on older bikes, and are often found with your handlebars. They are made to fit directly into the frame, and resemble a curved, "L" shaped pipe with a clamp on the end to attach to the handlebars.

The handlebars will hold the bike, and the stem will attach the bars to the wall.
 The pipe should match the diameter of your stem so that you can simply slide the stem into the pipe. Threading is the set of grooves at the end, similar to a screw. The flange attaches to your wall. It is a metal disk with holes in it for screws and a large hole in the middle that you can slide your pipe into.

Most stems are fine with a 3/4" diameter steal pipe. It should only be 4-5" long, however.
 One side should have the bike stem firmly packed into the pipe. Take the other end and screw it into the flange to securely attach them.

You may need to readjust the stem so that the handlebars still face up.
 Locate a stud and use and electric drill to attach the wall flange, which should already have your handlebars and stem attached.

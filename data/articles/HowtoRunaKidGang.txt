 Try to start with your city, i.e. Nicholson City Saints. Make a good name, but try not to copy the names of other gangs, and draft different logos that you and your gang members agree on.;
, One of your goals is to have as many members as possible. Try to recruit 11-17 year old members.
 You're going to want to have a quick way to identify other members of your gang once membership has become infectious. Simple yet distinguishable hand gestures will get your gang noticed in your territory.
 Have at least one computer in your house for data. Make wooden tools and weapons for gang play. Wear your gang colors to represent your gang. All members should have a bike, scooter, or a car, and have patrols out on the streets for rival gangs. Use your play weapons to fight other rival youth gangs, but do not kill them. Stay together and fight in a group.
 Find a spot around your city where you'll hang out like the woods, a forest, a car park, a school, or an abandoned building.
 As a gang you need to assign jobs, good or bad, such as stealing, or holding up a store. Be smart when assigning bad jobs. Purchase things like weapons, technology, or protective gear.
 If enemies attack, get together as a group and fight. Use protective gear to protect yourself and any of your members to avoid any damage that hospitalizes you or your members. Use kicks to beat them if they have retreated. Put patrols on the streets and increase your defenses.

 You may skip this step and start with store-bought yogurt for an even easier recipe. But if you'd like a recipe that involves fermentation, you can make an extra-thick "yoghurt cheese" from scratch. To do this, add the following steps to the recipe:


Heat 1 quart (1 liter) milk to exactly 110ºF (43ºC) with the help of a cooking thermometer. Avoid UHT or ultra-pastuerized milk for best results.
Stir in one packet of yoghurt starter culture, available from cooking supply stores and online cheese-making stores. Alternatively, use 2 tbsp (30mL) plain yoghurt with live active cultures.
Instead of draining in the refrigerator as described below, let drain in a yoghurt maker for 12–16 hours. This keeps the yoghurt around 100ºF (38ºC), encouraging bacterial fermentation.;
, Line a colander with at least four layers of cheesecloth, and place the colander over a large saucepan. Spoon as much yoghurt as you like onto the cloth.









You can tie the yoghurt up in the cheesecloth and hang it over a pot instead.
 The liquids in the yoghurt will drain away until you get a soft, cream-cheese like consistency. The longer you let the yoghurt drain, the thicker and more complex the cheese will be.








Optionally, you can occasionally smooth out the "cheese" with a spoon for a creamier texture.
Letting it drain at room temperature will speed up the process, but risks introducing harmful bacteria.
 Once the yoghurt is done draining, transfer it to a ramekin or bowl, using another clean cloth underneath. Cheesecloth will leave a beautiful printed pattern on the cheese, but you may use anything you like. Eat before it spoils, usually within a week or so.









Optionally, stir in salt and herbs for a cracker topping, or sugar for a light dessert.
You may discard the whey or use it as a substitute for milk in baking.

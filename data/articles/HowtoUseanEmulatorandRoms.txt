 There are many websites dedicated solely to storing emulators and ROMs for free download.;
, Don't forget to check it to make sure it doesn't infect your computer with a virus.
 You need to download a ROM for that video game console you wish to emulate. A ROM acts as the video game cartridge for the emulator, which acts as the console.


The Internet is your best friend when searching for the ROMs. Try searching for "(System Name) ROMs".
 Check for viruses on this as well. The ROMs file extension usually resembles the abbreviation of the console (Ex: SuperMarioBros.nes).
 You need to have a program that will decompress them, such as Winzip (Trial Version), or 7-Zip (Free). Sometimes, it is easier to leave the ZIP file compressed, and just place in its own folder. All of the save files should go directly into the created folder, nicely organizing your ROMs.
 If there is no folder automatically set, you will have to set one yourself.


Most Emulators have a (File>Open ROM) option, so do that, and a box will appear to select your game file.

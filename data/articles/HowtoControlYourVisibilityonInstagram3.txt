 You must do this on a phone.
 Tap the outline of a person on the bottom-right corner of the app to do so.
 To do this, tap on the roundish pin-shaped icon in the bar just above your feed of photos. You'll find yourself on your Photo Map, which displays the geographic locations of every photo you've taken that you allowed Instagram to take note of.









The Photo Map function of Instagram is an "opt in" feature, meaning that your photos won't be added to the Photo Map unless you decide to before confirming a photo post.
 This button is located in the top-right corner of your Photo Map.
 You may want to zoom in by tapping the screen with two fingers and moving them apart.

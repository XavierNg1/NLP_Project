 FIFO is an alternate method used to account for inventory costs. To calculate COGS using the FIFO method, first take a physical inventory count at the start date and again at the end date. It is important that these counts be 100% accurate.


It is helpful to have a different part number for each type of material.
 You can refer to the invoices sent by the vendors. The costs may vary even if it is all the same kind of inventory. Be sure to count the ending inventory value for a better understanding of how values are affected. The FIFO method assumes the first goods purchased or produced will be the first goods sold.


For example, imagine you stocked your inventory with 10 widgets at $1 each on Monday and another 10 at $1.50 each on Friday.
Also, assume that your ending inventory showed you sold 15 widgets by Saturday.
 Subtract the quantities sold from your inventory beginning with the earliest date. Then multiply them by the purchase cost.Your COGS would be 10 x $1 = $10 plus 5 x $1.50 = $7.50 for a total of $17.50.
Your COGS is lower under the FIFO reporting method and your profit is higher when inventory costs are rising. In this case your earlier inventory cost less than the inventory acquired later in the week, assuming both are sold to the consumer at the same price.
Use the FIFO method if the cost of your inventory tends to increase over time AND you need to have a strong balance sheet to impress investors or get a bank loan. This is because the value of your remaining inventory will be higher.

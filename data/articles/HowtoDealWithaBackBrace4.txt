 Tell those people you trust about your schedule with the brace and about your intended goals. Talk about not only your actions but your feelings as well. It is not unusual to feel angry or scared when you first start this process.


You might say, “To be honest, I’m really not happy about wearing this brace, so if you hear me getting too negative try to find a way to cheer me up.”

, You are not alone, even if you feel like it initially. Go online and look for a network of people going through a similar experience as yourself. For example, if you are wearing a back brace due to a sports injury, you can find a blog to contribute to. If you are wearing a brace due to scoliosis, you should consider joining a Curvy Girls chapter.
 Before each visit write down a list of your noticeable improvements, your concerns, and any questions that you may have. Get to your most important points first and don’t be afraid to make another appointment if you need more discussion time.


For example, you might ask your doctor if you could see a series of x-rays showing your progress over time. You could also ask for an estimate as to when you can quit wearing your brace., If you feel weighed down emotionally and are struggling with negativity, you may want to make an appointment with a therapist. This will provide you with another space for safe conversation about your fears and hopes related to the bracing process.

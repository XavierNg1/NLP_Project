 Be nice when you converse. Hinata possesses a very kind and gentle attitude. Care about others. If someone gets injured, ask if they are okay, (before looking to see if they actually are okay).;
, When you do talk to someone, stutter a lot. Play with your fingers when you're scared or nervous about something. Act nervous when you talk to your crush.


When you do talk, speak quietly in a high-pitched voice. Hinata is a very quiet girl! She's not loud at all!







,, Hinata has Purple-black hair that is short in Naruto, but is much longer in Naruto Shippuden, which takes place two years later.
,, Hinata may seem weak at first (especially compared to her older cousin, Neji Hyuga) but she can actually be fantastic at fighting. Especially when Naruto's around.


If you have not seen someone for a while show them how strong you have become. If your crush is in trouble stand up for him once in a while! Hinata stood up to Pein, so don't be afraid of anything at this time!







, This gives Hinata an edge over Neji, gymnastics is a great way to loosen up.
 If someone asks you to do something, do it, even if you really don't want to.
 Hinata gets frightened a lot.

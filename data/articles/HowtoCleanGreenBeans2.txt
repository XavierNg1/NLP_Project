 If you are cleaning beans fresh from the garden, the best way to remove dirt is to soak the beans. Fill a bowl or basin with cold water. There should be enough to cover the beans., Place the beans in the bowl, and let them soak for one to two minutes. Use your fingers to rub away dirt. You can also move around the beans with your fingers. Before you drain them, let any dirt or soil settle to the bottom of the bowl., After a minute or two of washing, pour the beans into a colander. The water will drain from the bottom. If you do not have a colander, fold some paper towels, and set the beans on top. They will drain into the towel.


If you are not eating the beans right away, pat them dry with a paper towel. Make sure they are completely dry before storage, as damp vegetables may spoil faster in the fridge., There may still be dirt on your green beans. Fill the bowl with clean water, and rinse them again. Do this until all of the dirt has been removed from the beans.

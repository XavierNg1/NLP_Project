 Tea jars, jam jars, and any other jars are great because the lid is screwed on, and no spider can escape from that unless they've been working out.;
, This will prevent your widow from trying to climb out.
 While trying to catch one, you won't need safety where unless you do something stupid. All you need is a container, and a stick/tongs. use the stick or tongs to nudge it into the container. They are slow spiders that can't jump or fly, it is easy!

, Black widows are shy creatures and would enjoy a place to hide.
 If you have cats, it's best to put the jar in a place where they don't go. The garage is potentially the safest place for the widow; it also makes them feel more comfortable.
 They will eat crickets, and most any other bug you put in there.
 It will agitate her.

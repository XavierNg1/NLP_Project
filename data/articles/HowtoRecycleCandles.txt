 Purchase additional candles at discount dollar stores or yard sales. Separate the candles by color and scent if needed. Use a flat screwdriver or butter knife to cut the wax into small pieces. Scrape wax out of jars or holders with a spoon and remove the wicks. Store the wax chunks in sealed storage bags until you are ready to recycle them.;
, Your local craft store will have the wicks, fragrance, and dyes you may wish to use. Candle holders can include jars, glasses, or even a tin can. You can also use a mold to make wick-less candle disks or decorative candles for the holidays.
 Use pans that are you do not use for general cooking or purchase old pans at discount stores or yard sales. A pan with a spout is perfect for pouring the hot wax into candle holders.
 Allow the pan to warm before adding the wax. Keep the burner on low so the wax does not heat too quickly. Stir occasionally to break up any chunks. This process can take up to 40 minutes.
 Measure the needed wick length so that the wick touches the bottom of the holder and stays straight. Tie the wick string around a pencil to help it stay in place over the center of the candle holder.
 Add fragrances or candle dye to help intensify the color of the candles. Follow manufacturer instructions on both the fragrance and coloring for best results.
 Using a strainer will help remove any remnants of dirt or burnt wick from the wax.
 If you do not have a pan with a spout, use a small ladle. Wear an oven mitt at this point to reduce the risk of being burned from splattering wax.
 Top off candles as needed as the wax settles.

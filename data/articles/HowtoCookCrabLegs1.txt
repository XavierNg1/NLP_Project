 Place the crab legs in the refrigerator the night before and let thaw slowly.


While slow thawing in the refrigerator is recommended, you can also thaw crab legs by placing them under cold, running water for several minutes.
The vast majority of frozen crab legs are pre-cooked. If you prefer uncooked crab legs, your only real option is to buy a live crab.
Cook the crab legs as soon as possible after thawing them. They are only good for about two days in the refrigerator and should not be refrozen.;
, Add in the salt, garlic powder, and dill, and heat the water to boiling over medium-high to high heat.


You could also use a Dutch oven instead of a heavy stockpot.
Instead of garlic powder and dill, you could use up to 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of a generic seafood seasoning blend or any other seasoning you generally enjoy with crab legs.
 Reduce the heat to medium and cook the crab legs for 3 to 6 minutes.


Leave the stockpot uncovered as the crab legs cook.
The crab legs only need to be cooked long enough to heat them. Cooking them too long will ruin their delicate flavor.
The water should be at a steady simmer as the crab legs cook.
 Remove the crab legs with tongs and place them on a serving platter to enjoy immediately.


If desired, you can also serve the crab legs with melted butter.

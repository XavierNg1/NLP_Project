 Do not cross your arms, this sends an uninviting vibe to someone who may want to come up and talk to you. Look open and inviting with a genuine smile.;
, Ask to be introduced, or do it yourself!

, Smile, and if you see a person enter who obviously does not know anyone, walk over to them, and bring them over to the group you are talking to.
 When you're in a conversation with other people and someone new walks up, look at him or her, smile and turn your body so that the group includes the newcomer.
 Avoid discussing obscure interests or work, and stick to conversations everyone can enjoy: Sports, music, festivals, current events, etc. Ask everyone to recommend a favorite restaurant, movie or museum. Keep the conversation light and fun.
 If you have a guest who's not mingling well, invite them to help you check on the punch or even allow them to help you fix the punch.

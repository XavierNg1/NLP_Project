 Raw brown sugar gives the best results. You only need tiny amounts for one treatment. Use your fingers for easy measurement and stirring:


Dip your (clean) middle fingertip in a saucer of honey (or olive oil), up to the first knuckle. Transfer to a bowl, scraping off with a spoon handle.
Dip your pinky finger up to the first knuckle in sugar. Stir into the honey.
 Dip the back of the spoon in your mixture and spread it thoroughly over your lips.
 Rub your lips together until you feel a tingling sensation, or until the exfoliating mixture dissolves. This will remove dead skin cells and stimulate blood flow, leading to clean, vibrant lips.


Add more of the mixture to your lips if it dissolves before you feel a tingle.
 For a faster treatment, when you don't have time to mix honey, simply brush your lips with a toothbrush for about twenty seconds. Keep your toothbrush wet and scrub gently, since lips are delicate. Rub in small, circular motions. You don't need to do this every day, lest you over-exfoliate your lips; a few times a week is fine.

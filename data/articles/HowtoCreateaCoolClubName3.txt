 Once you've come up with your club name, design a logo to go with it. You can even take your logo to a screen printer and have some T-shirts made for your members.
 You can pick a spot on the playground or meet at someone's house. You can even build a fort or a treehouse to create your own special meeting place.
 You can have a president, vice-president and treasurer, or you can make up your own types of officers depending on your club idea.
 If you're starting a babysitting club, for instance, you may need some money to take babysitting classes or to put an ad in your local newspaper.
 To get money, you can charge dues to your members, or you can ask your parents to help. If you want to raise money, think about doing a car wash or some other type of fundraiser, like a bake sale.
 After your first meeting, you can either meet whenever you feel like it, or you can schedule some regular meetings once or twice per week.

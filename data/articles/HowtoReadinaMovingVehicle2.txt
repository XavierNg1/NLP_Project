 Sit down low in your seat. Hold the book to your eye level and begin reading. Keep your line of sight toward the book at the same level as your line of sight out of the window. Looking downward while your side vision registers movement from outside the window causes symptoms of motion sickness. Keep your head up and your lines of vision on an equal plane., Avoid developing motion sickness by blocking the side vision entirely. Use your hand or a window curtain to do this. If you are on a ship, go beneath the deck and move toward the center where you are likely to experience the least amount of movement., Pivot your body so that your back is to the window closest to you. This will stop your eyes from seeing movement in your peripheral vision., Cars don’t have many seating options, but larger vehicles like buses, boats, and planes do. When reading on a boat or plane, find a place to sit where you won’t feel the motion of the vehicle.


On a boat, sit in the lower cabins near the center.
On a plane, sit close to the wings.If you’re on the bus, avoid sitting in the back where you’ll feel more bumps and have less access to fresh air.
 When it is dark outside it is much harder to see out of the windows. If you can’t see out of the window, you are less likely to get motion sickness.Bring a flashlight or book light to only light up the words on the page.

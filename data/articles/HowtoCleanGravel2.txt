 Use tin snips or heavy shears to cut a 2x2 foot section of cloth. The section of hardware cloth will act as a sieve so you can sift your gravel.Hardware cloth is metal or plastic wire mesh that is sold in rolls at your local hardware store.
 Once it is cut, roll or fold two edges of the cloth to make handles. Using your hands, slightly bend the rest of the edges up and inward to mold the cloth into a bowl-like shape. Shape it just enough so that the gravel will stay in the sieve as you sift it., Stabilize the tarp with rocks or another heavy object. Place your sieve on top of the tarp. The tarp will catch the debris as you sift your gravel.The tarp will enable you to easily discard the dirt and debris without too much mess.
 Use a flat-bottomed shovel to place the gravel on the sieve. Shake the sieve to remove dirt and other debris from the gravel. Shake the gravel until all of the dirt and debris are removed.Remove large chunks of dirt and debris with your hands.
 Use a gallon bucket, or another type of container. Only fill the bucket a third of the way with gravel. This way, the bucket will not be too heavy to lift when you transport the gravel.Alternatively, you can use a wheelbarrow to transport the gravel.
 Do this once the bucket is a third of the way full. Place the clean gravel on a tarp or a geotextile fabric while you can clean the rest of it.If you are cleaning the gravel to be placed somewhere in your yard, then transport the gravel there instead.

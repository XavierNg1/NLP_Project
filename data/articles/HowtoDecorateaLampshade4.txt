 You don't have to do this, but it can give your lampshade a while new look. For example, you can paint your lampshade turquoise and stencil some white designs onto it. You could also paint your lampshade white, and stencil some gold designs onto it., Do you want a pattern that covers the lamp completely? Or do you want to stencil on a small design (such as a flower or bird) here and there?, Some stencils have an adhesive back, so they should stick to your lampshade on their own. Other stencils are not adhesive and will move around. To keep that from happening, place your stencil where you want it, then secure it with a piece of painters tap or masking tape on each side of the stencil., The best types of paint to use are fabric paints or acrylic paints., Use a foam brush or a stencil paintbrush, and dab the paint on using a light, tapping motion. Do not apply too much paint at once, or the paint may drip under the stencil. Don't worry if the lampshade's color shows through the stencil; you can always apply a second layer., Sometimes, one layer of paint will give you enough covered. Other times, however, a single layer is not enough. If you still see some of the original color peaking through, apply a second layer, and if necessary, a third.,, Try not to cover up a previously-painted area with your stencil. This might cause the paint to smear if it is not fully dry., Sometimes, the paint does not reach the edges of the design, and you don't notice this until is it too late. If there are any bare patches in your design, take out a thin paintbrush and some extra paint. Carefully fill in those patches using the thin paintbrush., Refer to the label on your paint bottle for specific drying times. Some paints are fully dry and cured in as little as 20 minutes, while others require 2 to 4 hours. Some need more time than that before you can use them without worrying about ruining the finish.

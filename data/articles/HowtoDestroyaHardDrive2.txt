 The fastest, most direct method of destroying the platter is with a hammer. Put it on a surface that can take a beating and is easy to clean up, strap on some goggles and safety gloves, and take out your aggression that’s been pent up ever since George Lucas blasphemed all over what was a perfectly good franchise.


Make sure you’re the only person in the room when you do this; partially so that you don’t hurt anyone by accident with flying bits of glass and metal, and partially so that they don’t become concerned about your sanity levels and have you committed.
Some platters are made out of metal, some are made out of glass and ceramic. The latter will shatter readily. The former will certainly deform, which will make it pretty unusable, but you can also use some of the more exciting methods below if you aren’t convinced.
 Once it’s in pieces, carefully collect them and dispose of them. The parts may be taken anywhere that recycles electronics. Check your local computer/game retailers, department stores, and thrift shops.

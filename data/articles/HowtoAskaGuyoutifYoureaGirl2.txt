 If you don’t want to just obviously ask the guy on a date, you can suggest hanging out instead. Ask the guy about his interests or something fun he’s done recently. Then, you can suggest that the two of you go do something like that during the upcoming weekend.For example, if the guy says he likes baseball, you can say, “We should catch the game this weekend!” or “I haven’t been to the batting cages in forever. We should go on Friday!”

, If you are too nervous to ask him out on a solo date, try inviting him to a group outing. Get a bunch of your friends together and do something fun and low-key where you can talk and engage with him.For example, you can ask him out to dinner, for drinks, or to a movie. You can say, “We’re going to grab dinner tomorrow night. You should come with us!”

, If you are out with friends and see a cute guy, tell the bartender to send him a beer (or a soda, if you’re underage!). This allows him to know you’re interested and puts the ball in his court to make the next move.If he isn’t interested, you haven’t wasted too much time and took a chance. This kind of move can be low stakes and easy, especially if you aren’t good with approaching guys.

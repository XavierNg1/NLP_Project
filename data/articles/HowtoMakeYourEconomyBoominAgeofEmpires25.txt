 As such, you should continue to research new military technologies, upgrade units, and to create more units for a well-equipped army. There are a few things that should be done for your civilization, however:


As with previous ages, keep creating villagers! The ideal civilization contains around 100 villagers. Against hardest AIs and human opponents, do not cease villager creation, as villagers will die from attacks and raids. Allocate villagers according to your resources - if you have, for example, 7000 wood and only 400 food, it would be a good idea to use some lumberjacks and create more farms, as well as reseed in the queue. Wood on land maps generally becomes less important than food and gold in the Imperial Age.
Research Crop Rotation, Two-man Saw, and Gold Shaft Mining. Stone Shaft Mining is optional, but not a necessity, and resources can be better spent on your military. Treadmill Crane is also a useful technology that is found at the university.

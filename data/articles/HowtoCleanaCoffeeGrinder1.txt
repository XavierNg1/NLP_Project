 Buy a package of white rice at your local grocery store, or use rice that you already have on hand. Make sure to use white rice for cleaning purposes. Use ¼ cup (59 ml) to ⅓ cup (79 ml) depending on the size of your grinder.Measure the rice and pour it into the grinder.;
, Plug the grinder in and turn on the power. Turn on the blade and let it grind the rice for at least 30 seconds and up to one minute. This will turn the rice into rice flour.The rice cleans the grinder by soaking up oils and residue left in the grinder by coffee beans.
 Shut the grinder off and unplug it. If your grinder has a detachable hopper, take it off of the base. If not, take the whole grinder to the trash can. Dump the rice flour into the trash can.Even if you use rice flour on a regular basis, don’t use this flour because it is contaminated with old coffee residue.
 Get a paper towel barely damp with warm water. Carefully wipe down the inside of the grinder. Get all of the crevices. Be sure not to cut yourself on the blades as you wipe down the grinder.Rinse the paper towel and wipe the grinder more than once if necessary.
Be careful not to get the grinder soaking wet, as some of the moisture could stay inside it. Get the cloth just wet enough to wipe up the remaining flour.
 Never use your grinder for coffee beans when it is still wet from cleaning. Dry it off with a cloth and allow it to air dry completely before you use it again. It may be helpful to dry the grinder upside down to make sure no moisture settles into it.

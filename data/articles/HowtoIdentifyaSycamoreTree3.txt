 In autumn, the sycamore produces a small, woody ball on a long stem, which is its fruit. The American sycamore produces these as single, pendulum-like growths, while non-native hybrid relatives may have two or three of these hanging from one stalk., Sycamore seeds are arranged in V-shaped pairs that are often nicknamed helicopters because of the way they swirl and spin when they fall from the tree. This allows the tree a larger area of seed dispersal since they can flutter farther away. Look for them in clusters at the end of twigs, or on the ground beneath the tree., Sycamores have both male and female flowers on the same tree, though they grow on different stalks. They have a white stamen and very small, thin petals, which are a light green or yellow.

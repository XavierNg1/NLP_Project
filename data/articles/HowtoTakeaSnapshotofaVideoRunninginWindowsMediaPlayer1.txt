 You can capture the image when the video is playing full screen or when it's windowed. Lower-quality videos may not look very clear when played full-screen.;
, You'll have a much easier time capturing the snapshot if you pause the video on the frame that you want to save.
 This might be labeled slightly differently on your keyboard, but can typically be found above the Insert key. If you're on a laptop, you may have to press the Fn key first.


You won't receive any indication that the snapshot was captured, but it will have been copied to the clipboard.
 You can find this by opening the Start menu or screen and searching for "paint". This is the free image editor that comes installed with Windows.
 Either click "Edit" → "Paste" or press Ctrl + V to paste your screenshot onto the Paint canvas. You'll notice that the screenshot captured your entire screen.


If you paste the image and all you see is black in the Windows Media Player window, click here.
 Click and drag the selection box around the video frame. Click "Edit" → "Copy" or press Ctrl + C to copy the selected area to your clipboard.
 By default, your new Paint document will be exactly the same size as the copied image. Click "Edit" → "Paste" or press Ctrl + V to paste the selection onto the canvas. You now have a screenshot of only the frame from Windows Media Player.
 After pasting the image, click "File" → "Save As" and save your new image to your computer.

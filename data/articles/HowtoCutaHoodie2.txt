 For this project, choose a hoodie that does not zip.
 Smooth it out.
 Start in the center and cut in a circular motion until you have removed the hood entirely.


If you want to hem the edge of the crew neck down, leave 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) of fabric above the hem while you cut.
If you want the edge of the crew neck to be rough and deconstructed, cut as close to the hem as you can.If you want an off-the-shoulder sweatshirt, cut below the hood. Expand the cut approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) wider around the perimeter. You can always cut more, if you want it to slouch further off your shoulder.
 Turn the sweatshirt inside out. Wrap the fabric above the collar hem down.


Pin it in place. Continue pinning until the entire collar is pinned.
, Remove the pins as you sew.


Ensure you keep the back and front of the sweatshirt separate, so that you donâ€™t sew both sides of the crew neck together.
 Try it on. If it is too baggy, you can use the first method to make it fitted.

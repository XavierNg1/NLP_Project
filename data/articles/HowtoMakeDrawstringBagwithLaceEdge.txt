 First, use a compass to draw a circle. Then draw three lines tangent to this circle: two parallel, one on each side of the circle, and the last one on top. Lengthen the lines until they meet.


Extend the two parallel lines a few inches and draw a new horizontal line to connect them. This gives you two patterns, one slightly taller than the other.;
, Using one color or pattern of cloth, cut out two pieces to match the smaller pattern, the one that uses the lines tangent to the circle. Using another color or pattern, cut out two pieces according to the second pattern; these will be taller than the others.

In all, you should have two pairs of identical pieces of cloth.
 They should meet at the square edge, so that when you've finished this step, you will have two identical ovals of fabric.


To decorate the bag, sew lace around the edge of the lower part of each oval.
 Make sure to leave an inch or so at the top that isn't sewn; the drawstring will run through the channel you leave here.,, Thread a braided rope through the channel at the top of the bag and tighten it to close the bag; add one bead at each end of the rope.


Sew two bows on the bag for decoration.

 Do this by tapping on “Apps” in the lower right corner of your home screen, which is its default placement.
 Find S Health by scrolling to the right. Once you find the app, tap on it to open the app.


You should be greeted by an overview screen of your recent activity logs if you’ve used the app before.
 Swipe inward from the left edge of your screen to open the S Health panel, where you will see a number of functions that S Health can deliver.
 Tap on “Heart Rate,” right below “Exercise.” It is the green heart icon.


Place your finger over the heart rate sensor just below the camera at the back of the device, beside the LED flash, and try to remain still to get accurate readings.
The app will display “Measuring” on the screen, which indicates that the app is still doing calculations. The text will change to “Finished” when the readings are done, and you will see a bpm reading on the center of the screen.

 In a sink or bucket, mix about one or two teaspoons (15 to 30 ml) of mild laundry detergent with a quart of lukewarm or cold water. Stir together so that the water is soapy.


A mild detergent, like Ivory Snow or Seventh Generation, is best for cleaning canvas shoes like Keds because they help protect the color. Look for detergents that are labeled as suitable for delicates., Before you put the shoes in the water, remove the laces and any inserts. Soak the shoes. Use a toothbrush, a scrub brush, or a cotton cloth to gently clean around the shoe. Make sure to go around both the canvas and the soles.


If you want, you can clean your laces in this same water. Soak the laces, and use the brush to remove any visible dirt.
 Once the shoes are clean, rinse them with cold, clean water. Do not use the same water that you used to wash them. Run the water over the shoes until there are no longer any soap suds.


After rinsing, you can use a towel to remove excess water. Wrap the towel around the shoes, and gently press to soak up water. Do not wring or squeeze the shoes tightly., Do not put your Keds in the dryer. Instead, let them air dry. Stuff the insides with tissue, paper towels, or newspaper. Keep them in a dry area without direct heat. They may take overnight to dry.You can place your Keds out in the sun to dry, but avoid putting them near direct heat sources, such as a hair dryer or a heat vent. Direct heat can weaken the glue in your shoes.Do not put the laces and inserts back until the shoe is completely dry. If you washed your laces, make sure they are dry as well.

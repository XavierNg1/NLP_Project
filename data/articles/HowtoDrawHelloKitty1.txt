 Make sure you add in guidelines in the center of the oval for the eyes and nose: they are very helpful to draw the facial features. They should cross as seen, so you can use them in the next step when you add those features.






;
, Between and below them, draw another small oval for her nose.
 They can vary in length and flair; the usual style is shown here.
 Draw a large circle and two small circles on each side overlapping the large one. Draw two triangles in each side of the circle with curved sides.
 Draw two ovals for the feet.
 Don't forget two circles for her thumb! Hello Kitty doesn't really have fingers, like a human, or paws, like a cat; her look is unique to her, so try hard to get it right.
 She usually wears a jumper and a shirt. (You can dress her in any kind of clothing youâ€™d like, though!)








, Erase the guidelines and any other unnecessary marks.now your hello kitty's basic sketch is ready!!








, Use primarily shades of pink, with a dot of yellow for her nose and darker eyes/whiskers. You're done!

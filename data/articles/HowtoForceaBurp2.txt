 You can also learn techniques for forcing a burp, or what you might call a burp on demand. First of all, sit up straight in order to maximize your lung capacity.


Relax your lungs. Then, exhale in a normal breathing pattern, until your lungs feel neither full or empty.
 Expand your throat and jaws and then suck air in your mouth. Pull until you feel an air bubble enter your throat. When you have done this, block the front of your mouth with your tongue.


To do this, take your tongue and touch it to the top of your mouth.
Forcing air into the air into your throat can take a little practice. You don't want to inhale so forcefully that you swallow the air, otherwise you will feel more bloated. Try to keep it in your throat.
Release the air slowly by lowering your tongue and parting your lips, letting it escape.
 This is another way to force a burp that some people find easier. Close the airway at the back of your throat, but push out as though you were exhaling. This can put enough extra pressure on your stomach to push an air pocket up your esophagus.
 If the above technique is unsuccessful, try repeating the first steps but swallowing the air in your throat. First, exhale as much air as you can to empty your lungs. Take a deep breath and hold it as long as you can. Exhale, inhale another deep breath, and try to swallow the air.


This may not come naturally. One way trick that might work is to drink a glass of water while holding your breath. Pinch your nose, too, to ensure that you do not exhale any of the air.
 Once you have swallowed enough air, you should feel more pressure building up in your abdomen and esophagus. Open your mouth and allow a resounding belch to escape.


Tighten your abdominal muscles when you feel the burp rising. This should maximize both its force and volume.
Practice your burp on demand. Over time, the procedure will become easier and less uncomfortable.

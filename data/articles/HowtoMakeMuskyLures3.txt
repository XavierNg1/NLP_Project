, Thread the tubing down far enough to cover the looped end of the shaft, the split ring, and the hook shank. The tubing is to keep the hook from fouling on the spinner body during the cast.
 You can use a butane lighter or art torch. Heat the tubing only enough to shrink it, not melt it, then let it cool before continuing.
, The skirt coil should rest on top of the spacer beads, while the skirt itself should hide the beads and just reach the bends of the treble hook. If it doesn't, remove the skirt and add or subtract spacer beads until it does.
, This forward treble hook will help you catch muskies that hit the spinner in the middle.
, If you're using willow leaf, Indiana, or Colorado (teardrop-shaped blades), you'll probably want two blades for more flash and turbulence. If you're using a propeller blade, you'll probably be satisfied with just one; although if you're using a squat style, you may want two.


If you're using a teardrop-shaped blade, thread a clevis through the hole in the blade top and slip the clevis on the shaft, making sure the convex side of the blade is out and the concave side faces the spinner shaft.
If you're using a propeller blade, thread it directly onto the shaft with the blades facing the body and skirt.
You may want to use spacer or decorative beads to put some distance between multiple blades. Don't put so much space between the blades, however, that you prevent them from touching each other, as an accidental slapping of blades can draw fish.
 You'll need pliers for this.


Grab the spinner above the top blade with the pliers. With your free hand, bend the shaft around the tip of the pliers, forming an eye.
Wrap the tag end around the shaft four times, closing the eye. Trim the end with wire cutters and file the cut if necessary.

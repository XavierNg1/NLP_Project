 Place a rack in the middle of the oven and heat your oven to 350 °F (177 °C).
 Use aluminum foil to line a baking sheet and pour your entire bag of chips onto the foil, spreading for an even layer. Using aluminum foils helps with cleanup later. The foil also makes it easier to transfer your cooked nachos onto a separate dish.
 In a small saucepan over low heat, cook refried beans until they are loose enough to spoon onto nachos. Stir occasionally until beans are warm.


Don't let the beans get so hot that they boil, this will cause them to dry out and get crusty.
 Scoop 2 cups of beans onto the layer of chips. Distribute as evenly as possible. Sprinkle 4 tablespoons of diced green chilies on top if you prefer a spicy kick to your nachos.
 Use some shredded cheese or freshly grate it yourself and evenly distribute it over the top of your nachos. Use about 2 cups. The idea is to get all your chips covered in a thin layer of cheese. You can use more or less cheese if you prefer.
 Remove the baking sheet from the oven once your beans are hot and the cheese is melted. Be sure to use an oven mitt when removing the baking sheet. Scoop 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of guacamole on top of the nachos.


Drop another spoonful of salsa or Pico de Gallo on top if you prefer.
 The beans and cheese can get very hot so you may need to let your nachos cool on the counter for a few minutes before eating. Serve warm with a beverage of your choice.

 Because of its Google ownership, you can access it straight from the homepage. Click on the nine small squares and hit the YouTube symbol. Another option is to type in the address onto the address bar.;
, Scroll to the bottom of the page. You will find a bar, with a "Safe Mode" option. This is what you will be working with.
 After clicking "Safe Mode", a drop down menu will show up. You will have the option to set "Safe Mode" on your YouTube account. Click "On", then "Save". Your YouTube channel will now have "Safe Mode" on.
 Use YouTube as you normally would, but now, there is very little inappropriate content. Be aware that "Safe Mode" only applies to the browser you are currently using.

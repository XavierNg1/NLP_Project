 Anna was always seen with two braids on the movie.


If you don't have Anna's hair color, that's fine. There's no need to be a clone. Just copy her hairstyles.
Anna has a small white streak, usually hidden away. You could get an extension for this.;
, Anna wears brightly colored clothes in the movie.


Bright colors such as pink, orange, green and blue are suitable.
 Anna's make-up is fairly natural. Try putting on a little shiny pink gloss on the lips, and pink-coloured blush. Add a cream blusher, not powder. Make sure the lip gloss is darker on the top lip.


Anna has lots of cute freckles across her nose and cheeks. If you don't naturally have freckles, then you could add them using a neutral-brown coloured eye pencil and using it to dot on some freckles.
 Anna's eyes are big and bright blue. If you don't have blue eyes, or if they are the wrong shade, you could use some contacts or just accept that you're not trying to be "exactly" like her.


Anna has very thick lashes. Use black mascara to achieve this appearance yourself. Or, if you want a more natural look, use brown mascara. You might need to use fake eye-lashes.
Anna's eyebrows are thick and neat. They look like they have been neatly plucked, but don't over-pluck. Anna's eyebrows look natural, so don't over-do it. They are just a shade darker than her hair.
In the short film Frozen Fever, which is set on Anna's nineteenth birthday, Anna wears more apparent makeup; her eye makeup consists of a light brownish eyeshadow and darker mascara. She pairs this with her coronation hair updo.

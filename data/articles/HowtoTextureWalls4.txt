 Place 2 complimentary colors of paint in your paint tray. Work in curves going right and left to mix the paint thoroughly on your walls. This method has largely replaced the use of sponges to apply different colors; it is a very efficient method.
 Paint a neutral color of latex paint on your wall. Roll a wood grain tool in a tray of paint, and then roll it vertically down your wall, alternating with both sides of the tool to produce the uneven look of wooden boards.

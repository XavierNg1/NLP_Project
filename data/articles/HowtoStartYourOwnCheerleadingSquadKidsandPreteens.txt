 Think of a team that inspires you from a movie, or just think one up. Sometimes, you can make up team colors, then show what they represent. For example, if your colors are blue gray and white, you can be the bulldogs.;
, If you can, put up flyers around the school/city to let people know about it. Have a set date and time. Some basic requirements that need to be met are:


Are they flexible? Kids should at least be able to do a roundoff and be able to bend easily. Preteens should be able to do that to, with also having to do a few stunts. Not too many, just a few.






Appearance. The kids should be able to have a lot of make up applied and be able to have their hair curled or straightened. The kids should also look pretty presentable and clean







, There should be a captain, co-captain, and a minimum of five other girls/boys. Take a vote. You don't have to have boys, just a suggestion.
 You can either order, or just wear a certain outfit. It should match team colors.
, If you want, and your team is skilled, join a competition.

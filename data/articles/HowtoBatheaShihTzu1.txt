 Given a Shih Tzu's small stature, opt to bathe the dog in a sink. Line the bottom of the sink with a rubber mat or thick towel so the dog doesn't slip. Run the water and test it on your wrist; the water should be lukewarm, not hot., Lay down extra towels on the ground and counter to absorb any water that might splash out of the sink during your dog's bath time. Make sure to have all your supplies by the sink, except for the blow dryer; this way you won't have to interrupt your dog's bath to go get something later. Your bath time tools should include:


good quality dog shampoo and conditionera towel to dry your dog after the bath
treats
brush
hair dryer (kept away from the bathing area)

, Before bathing your Shih Tzu, make sure to brush them to remove mats and tangles that could be worsened in the water.This is best done with the dog on their side; make sure not to tug or pull hair. Use a small comb to brush hair around the eyes carefully., To prevent water from entering your dog's ears, place small cotton wads in each ear. Do this gently and be careful not to hurt the dog if it wriggles around during this process. To make things easier, brace the dog's head and offer them something to bite (like a toy or bone) while you insert the cotton.

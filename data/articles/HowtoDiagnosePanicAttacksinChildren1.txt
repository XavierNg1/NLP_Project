 Children often find it hard to explain the emotional symptoms of a panic attack. Instead, your child may instead describe the physical symptoms that go along with panic attacks. These are the symptoms that they are more likely to understand. These physical symptoms can include:


Trembling or shaking
Chest pain
Feeling dizzy or light headed
Feeling chills or overheated
Nausea
Sweating
Choking sensations
Difficulty breathing;
, Panic attacks are often coupled with psychological issues that affect your child. You child may tell you about feeling as if he or she is going crazy or losing control of him or herself. Your child may also express an irrational fear of dying or losing control.


Your child may not know how to express these feelings in the right way. Make sure you listen to what they are saying so you can determine exactly what his or her symptoms are., Panic attacks are unpredictable, which means they can be brought on by anything. Your child may be triggered by a stressful event, an uncomfortable social situation, or any number of other external stimuli.


Your child may express this as a cause and effect situation, such as "It started when I had to speak in front of class." However, when these situations happen at random in response to all different sorts of activities, your child is likely experiencing panic attacks., Your child may have fearful experiences that are not panic attacks. Since panic attacks are unpredictable, there will be no common trigger to your child's panic. However, if your child has a predictable fear towards a particular stimuli, then your child could have a phobia. A mental health professional, such as a psychologist or a professional licensed counselor, should be able to provide you with a diagnosis.

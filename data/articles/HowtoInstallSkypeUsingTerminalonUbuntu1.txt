 It used to be that Skype had to be installed by manually downloading the binary from Skype’s website, but now you can install it from the Canonical Partners repository. Start by opening a terminal window.;
, If you’re using the 64-bit version of Ubuntu, you’ll need to enable Multiarch so the program will install. At the command prompt:Type: sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386

Press ↵ Enter.
 This repository, which is where Skype (and a lot of other closed-source software) is found, is disabled by default.To enable it from the command line:Type: sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ $(lsb_release -sc) partner"

Press ↵ Enter.
 Ubuntu recommends that Skype only be installed through this repository (rather than downloading the package from Skype’s website).Here’s how:


Type: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install skype

Press ↵ Enter to begin the installation. When the installation is complete, you’ll return to the command line.
 This will launch Skype. Follow the prompts to create your account so you can get started with video chat.

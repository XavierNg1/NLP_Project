 Put about an inch of water in a saucepan. Cook it on the stove over medium-high heat. Heat the water until it is steaming., Place all your ingredients in a heat safe bowl. Place the bowl over the steaming water, making sure that the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water. Use a small spoon or spatula to stir the ingredients. Keep stirring until the ingredients are melted and fully combined. This should take about 5 minutes.


You will know the ingredients are all melted when the mixture is smooth.
 Pour the ingredients into a small, sterilized lip gloss container. Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature. This should take about 1 hour.


You may want to place it in the fridge to help it cool faster.
 Apply with a small brush or your fingertip. Store your lip gloss in your purse. Be aware that the gloss will melt in high temperatures. If this happens, put the container in the fridge to solidify it again.


This recipe makes one container. It will stay good for up to two months.

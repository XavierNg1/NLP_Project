 It's important that your dog has a space that is all their own within your house. If you decide to crate your dog, the crate can become this safe space. If you do not crate your dog, make sure they have a bed in a designated area of the house., It is important that your dog understands what parts of the house are open to dogs, and what parts are off limits. Use child or pet gates to block off areas you do not wish your dog to visit. You can also close doors to rooms that are not part of your four-legged friendâ€™s territory., As a dog owner, you have multiple options when it comes to rules regarding furniture. You can teach your dog to completely stay off the furniture, institute an invitation-only policy, or allow the dog to sprawl out on the couch whenever they feel the urge.If you want your dog to stay off the furniture completely or to enforce an invitation-only policy, try placing a barrier on the furniture to prevent them from getting onto it, like boxes or upside down chairs.

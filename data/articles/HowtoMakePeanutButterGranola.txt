 Begin by preheating the oven to 325°F (176.7°C). Pour the oats into a mixing bowl. Put peanut butter, honey, and brown sugar into a separate bowl., Put the peanut butter mixture into the microwave. Microwave it for about 25 seconds. The mixture should be runny and smooth when it’s ready., Pour the peanut butter over the oats. Use a spatula to toss the mixture together. Combine the mixture until the oats are evenly coated., Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour the mixture over the parchment paper. Spread the mixture until it is evenly layered on the pan., Put the baking pan in the oven. Allow it to bake for 18-20 minutes. Stir the mixture one time halfway through the baking., Take the granola out of the oven once it has turned golden brown. Allow it to cool completely. Eat it immediately, or store it in an airtight container to be eaten later.Homemade granola will usually stay good for about two months.
The granola will not be crunchy if you don’t let it cool off before eating.
 Chocolate chips are a great way to add a bit of sweetness to your granola. Adding one cup (236.6 g) of semi-sweet chocolate chips is recommended. Dark or white chocolate chips would also work well, though., You can use maple syrup instead of honey if you are looking for a vegan alternative. Use 1/4 cup (59 g) of maple syrup. Pour it into the peanut butter mixture as you would the honey., This recipe is already flavorful on its own, but you can choose to add cinnamon if you are looking for extra flavor. Add in ½ teaspoon of cinnamon to the peanut butter, honey, and brown sugar mixture. You can also sprinkle it on top of the granola when it is cooling down after being taken out of the oven., This is a good choice if you have a peanut allergy. Almond butter is a tasty and easy-to-find alternative, but you could use any nut or seed butter. Simply use the nut or seed butter in place of the peanut butter when you combine it with the honey and brown sugar.

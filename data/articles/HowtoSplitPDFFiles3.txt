 The Preview program that comes with all Mac computers can perform a lot of basic tasks without the need for extra software.


If your PDF files aren't set to open in Preview, right-click on the file you want to split and select "Open with" â†’ "Preview".
The process with Preview is a little more time-consuming than using an online tool or Google Chrome, so if you're in a hurry you may want to consider one of those options.
 This will display a list of all the pages that the PDF contains.
 When you drag a page from the Thumbnails frame onto your desktop, it creates a new PDf file containing just that page. Do this for each page that you want to split into a separate file.


For example, if you have an 8-page PDF file and want to create a separate file with just the first four pages, drag each of the first four pages onto your desktop.
 Now that you've separated the pages, you'll want to combine them back into one new PDF file.


When you open the PDF, make sure that the Thumbnail view is enabled.
 Drag each of the single pages from your desktop into the thumbnail frame. You can move them around so that they're in the order that you want.
 The new file will contain all of the single pages that you extracted from the original PDF.

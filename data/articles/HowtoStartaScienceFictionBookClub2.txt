 A group that is too small may not have much to say, but a group that is too large may prevent some people from participating. Usually, groups that range between 5 and 15 people are a good size. Smaller groups will create a more personal atmosphere, but slightly larger groups will allow for a greater exchange of ideas and may be ideal for science fiction book clubs.
 Ask anyone you know who likes science fiction to join your group. You can also bring it up to people who do not like sci-fi and ask them to pass word along to anyone they know who might be interested.
 Put posters up in your local library or create ads on free online classifieds. You can also advertise in science fiction forums online. Even though these forums already offer members the chance to discuss their favorite stories, some members may also be interested in participating in an actual book club, especially if they want to meet with local sci-fi fanatics in person.

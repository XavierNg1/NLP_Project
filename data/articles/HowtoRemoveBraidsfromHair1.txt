 Run your hair under a shower head or a faucet. Remain under the water until your hair is wet.


If you shampooed your hair first, make sure all of the shampoo is rinsed out of your hair.;
, Deep conditioning your braids the day before you remove them will moisturize, soften, and strengthen your natural hair. Squeeze a generous amount of product into your hands and run the deep conditioner down the length of your braids.


As you apply a generous amount of deep conditioner to your braids, donâ€™t forget to coat the edges of your hair., The deep conditioner needs to penetrate through the braid to reach your natural hair. Place the coated braids between the palms of your hands. Quickly twist or roll the braids between your palms to spread the product throughout the braid.


This twisting or rolling motion will ensure that the deep conditioner reaches your natural hair.
 Gather your braids into a twist atop your head and place a shower cap over your head. Allow the product to sit for ten to twenty minutes. Step into a shower or place your head under a faucet and rinse your hair thoroughly.


If you wish, you may sit under a hooded dryer for a deeper condition.

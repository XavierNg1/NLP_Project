 Close the jaws completely. If the needle on the dial doesn't point to zero, rotate the dial with your fingers, until the zero is beneath the needle.You may need to loosen a screw at the top or base of the dial face before you can do this.If so, remember to tighten the screws again after you've made the adjustment.
 Close the larger, flat jaws around an object to measure the outside diameter or width, or insert the smaller, curved jaws into an object and expand to measure the interior diameter or width.
 The scale engraved on your caliper can be read just as you would a regular ruler. Find the value at the inner edge of your caliper's jaws.


The scale should be labeled with a unit, typically cm (centimeters) or in (inches).
Note that the inches scale of a caliper is typically an engineer's scale, with each inch divided into ten parts (0.1) or five parts (0.2). This is different from most rulers, which display sixteenths or eighths of an inch.
 The needle on the dial points to an additional value for more precise measurement. The units should be labeled on the dial face, typically 0.01 or 0.001 cm or in.
 Convert both measurements to the same unit, then add them together. For many applications, you may not need to use the most precise digits.


For example, the fixed scale displays 5.5 and is labeled cm. The needle on the dial points to 9.2 and is labeled 0.001 cm, so this represents 0.0092 cm. Add them together to get a measurement of 5.5092 cm. Unless you are working on a project that requires extreme precision, you can probably round this to 5.51 cm.

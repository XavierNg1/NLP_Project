 Continue heating until all the proteins are burnt black and the oil oozes out. It will take a long time before this happens. At this stage you will observe a lot of pungent smoke.
 Allow the pan to cool to room temperature.
 Squeeze the oil, filter it through a fine cloth or a strainer. Store in a clean, dry glass or ceramic (not metal or plastic) bottle. Use a nylon or synthetic cloth to filter as cotton tends to absorb a lot of oil which would be wasted. If there are any solid particles you see in the oil, filter again to ensure you have only clear, transparent oil. Avoid any exposure to water or dipping anything inside the bottle for a longer life. You can store refrigerated up to three years or at room temperature up to one year. If handled carefully, the oil remains sterile up to 5 years.

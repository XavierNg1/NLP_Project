 If your dog is too fat, it will have trouble moving and experience inflammation of the joints, which limits mobility in mornings. Carrying around a lot of extra pounds is hard on the skeleton and joints. Plus, obesity in dogs (as in people) also leaves them open to a host of other maladies, including diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure.Overweight dogs will suffer from stiffness. But your dog should also not be too skinny.
The ideal dog weight is one in which you can feel the ribs, but they are not poking out. Your dog’s abdomen should appear tucked – not hanging – when viewed from the side., Supplements that improve joint health can help relieve your dog’s morning stiffness. They are available in oral, liquid, and (with a veterinarian prescription) injectable forms. Fish oil – used to improve joint support – is one of the most common doggie supplements. Other popular supplements the provide similar effects include glucosamine and chondroitin, which are often available in one combination supplement. Hyaluronic acid can also help lubricate joints for increased morning mobility.Always follow manufacturer directions when administering supplements. Only give your dog as much as is appropriate based on its age and weight.
 Most dog food manufacturers offer dog foods designed specifically with older dogs in mind. These dog foods might have lower calorie counts per serving, or have increased levels of fiber. But these dog foods are not necessarily what your dog needs. If your dog remains active into its golden years, it might need a regular, higher-calorie dog food.Ask your vet about recommendations regarding its diet.
 Your vet might have specific recommendations about your pet’s diet based on its health history and species. Explain the situation to your vet and let them know what you feed your dog. Ask, “Do you have any recommendations about what I should be feeding my dog to reduce its morning stiffness?”

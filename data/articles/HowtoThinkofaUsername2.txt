 It often helps to think of a unique characteristic about yourself, like your eye color or a particular passion you may have. This does not mean the last four digits of your Social Security Number! Be vague! A good example may be "GreenEyedBiker" if you love to bike and have green eyes.
 If you are creating an account at your school or business, sometimes it is best just to keep it simple by making your username your first initial and your last name. For example, if your name was Jane Smith, you could use "jsmith."To make this name more unique, add your middle initial or a number that bears significance to you.
 A great way to make your username more unique is to add numbers and symbols in the place of more complicated names. For instance, you can jazz up "jsmith" by turning it into "j_smith35." This is also a simple way to get that username you initially wanted but you were told that name has already been taken.

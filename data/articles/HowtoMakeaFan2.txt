 You can leave it square, cut it into a circle, round the bottom and make the top taper for a spade shape, or cut it into a heart.
 The side of the fan that will be hidden should be facing up at you.
 Make sure to keep glue off the part of the stick that will extend out from the piece of cardstock.
 Ensure that a good portion of the stick is extended out from the paper, so you will have a handle to hold.
 This will hide the stick and create a sturdy double-sided fan. Be sure to spread glue onto the back of the handle, as well as around all edges of the fan.
 Once it's dry, you can use your fan or embellish it.

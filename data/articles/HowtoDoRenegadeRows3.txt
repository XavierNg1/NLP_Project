 When performing renegade rows, you have the option of lifting either kettlebells or dumbbells. Since kettlebells are going to move around more than dumbbells do, using them will make the exercise slightly more dynamic and more difficult.If you're switching from dumbbells to kettlebells, you may want to start with a lower weight kettlebell than you were using with dumbbells, so you can make sure you're still using proper form and get used to the change.
 You can add a challenge to the already challenging renegade row by doing a push-up in between each row. Start by rowing with your right arm, lower it completely, do a push-up, then row with your left arm., The further apart your feet are, the easier your renegade rows will be. Increase the difficulty by gradually moving your feet more closely together. Only move your feet closer together when your core is stable and you can do the exercise with perfect form., While it's not necessarily a variation, after incorporating renegade rows into your workouts two or three times a week for a couple weeks, you should regularly increase the weight of the dumbbells that you use.Increasing the weight on a regular basis keeps the exercise challenging to continue building a strong and stable core.
The ideal goal is to continue increasing weight until the dumbbells you are using are equal to your body weight.

 This can be used especially when a word being emphasized may affect the general meaning of a sentence. For example, "You like PCs?" could read "You like PCs?" in reply to someone saying that they prefer PCs, or it could read "You like PCs?" in reply to someone that says they "actually like" them.;
, Something important would be headings, topic sentences, etc. Also, something that they need to remember could be in bold to catch their eye. For example, a webpage could read, "Do not keep in reach of children." (notice how "not" is italicized to emphasize it?). It would catch the attention of the reader and they would remember it better.
 This could be used similar to the way bold text is used to convey something is important, except it would be less of a warning sign and more of a "take note" indicator.
 Be careful to not overuse or the text will seem choppy. For example, if you were talking about sites similar to wikiHow, you could use the phrase "websites like wikiHow...". However, if you were talking about sites in general, including wikiHow, you could put "websites (like wikiHow)..." (alternatively, you could also use "websites, such as wikiHow,...").

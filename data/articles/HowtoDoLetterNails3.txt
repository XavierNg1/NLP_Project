 If you have not already done so, apply a base coat and 1 to 2 coats of your favorite nail color. Let each coat dry before applying another. Don't add a top coat just yet.


This method is great if you want a specific type of font, such as block letters.
 You will be using these letters as a stencil, so the color does not matter. You can use any font you want, but the letters need to be small enough to fit onto your fingernails., If your sheet of paper is small enough, you can even tuck it inside the bag.
 This will give the nail polish something to stick to. You will be peeling this off the plastic bag, so the thicker the top coat layer, the better.
 You can use a striper brush or a very thin, pointed paintbrush. These letters will be going directly onto your nails, so try to be as precise as possible; use the printed letters under the bag as a guide.
 Grip the letters by the top coat, then carefully peel them away from the plastic bag.Carefully trim away any excess top coat with a pair of scissors. Use the tweezers to hold the letters while you cut them.
 It might be a good idea to do this one nail and letter at a time so that the top coat does not dry out too fast. The top coat will "glue" the letter to the nail.
 Paint over the letters again using your striper brush or thin paintbrush to make the letters more opaque. Use the background color (what you painted your nails with) to clean up any uneven edges.
 This will seal your work and make your manicure last longer. Let your nails dry completely before doing anything with them. Be careful with them for the first hour or so. The polish will still be soft, and it can get nicked easily.

 Look for the TextPlus app on your Android phone. It’s the app icon with the green background and the TextPlus logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 Tap the menu button on your Android device to display the menu, and then tap “Buy or Earn Credit” from here. The “Get Credits” screen will appear.
 Your current credit balance on TextPlus is displayed at the top. You can determine here if you have enough credit to make calls. You can check the calling rates by tapping on the “Check TextPlus Rates” at the bottom of the screen.
 You can get additional credits by completing certain offers and watching videos. Swipe down to see the “Earn Credits” section and tap on either “Complete Offers” or “Watch Videos.” A new screen will appear showing you the current available offers or videos. Complete the required task or watch the video to earn the additional credits.
 If you want to purchase your credits instead, you can choose among $1.99, $5.49, $10.99, and $24.99 calling credits. Tap on the one you’d like to buy.
 Follow the on-screen instructions to complete your purchase. Google Play or Google Checkout will process your payment. Once the purchase is completed, you should see your credit balance increase accordingly. You can now make more cheap calls with TextPlus.

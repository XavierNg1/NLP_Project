 You will need a matchbox full of matches, any kind of tape of your choice, and scissors. This particular bomb lets out a faster and louder explosion than the flaming fireball.
 Be careful not to accidentally strike and ignite any of them.
 Use the end of the striking head as the place you should cut. Dispose of the stick ends. In the end, you should have a pile of small, round, match heads.
 Most boxes will have two strip on either lengths of the box. Dispose of the rest of the box.









For this particular fireball, one striking strip is all that is needed.
 its striking surface should be the inside of the loop. Then, tape the ends together.
 Tape the end of the striking surface over the top so the match heads are trapped inside.









Don't shake the structure too much or the match heads might ignite.
You might not be able to fit all the match heads inside the loop. Adjust the striking strip accordingly or save the match heads for later.
 You want to make this into a nearly air-tight ball, but you don't want to overdo the thickness of the tape.
 You can also throw it against the wall or any other safe surface for it to explode.









Have a fire extinguisher or any other fire safety measures at ready in case an accident happens.

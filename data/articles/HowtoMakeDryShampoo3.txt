 Add either ¼ cup of arrowroot powder or ¼ cup of cornstarch and 1-2 teaspoons of unsweetened cocoa powder into a medium sized bowl. Mix these ingredients thoroughly with a spoon.The cocoa powder helps to camouflage the dry shampoo in darker hair colors.
 Add in about 5 drops of your favorite essential oil. Use a spoon to again mix the ingredients until all of them are fully combined.
 Use a funnel to carefully pour the contents of the bowl into a small container. Once the dry shampoo ingredients are added, secure on the top of the container and check for any gaps or openings.


Consider using a container that looks like a salt or pepper shaker, and has a lid with tiny holes in it. This will allow you to gently scatter the dry shampoo onto the roots of your hair.

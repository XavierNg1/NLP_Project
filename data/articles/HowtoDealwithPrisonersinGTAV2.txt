 It is located in the Grand Senora Desert. This random event takes place along the road to the southeast. When you are nearby, you will see a blue dot on your radar after it flashes. If you do not see it, that means the random event is not available yet, and you will need to return at another time or with another character to trigger it.


You must be in a land vehicle, such as a car, truck or motorcycle, in order for this random event to be completed. If you do not arrive in a land vehicle, the prisoner will run away.
 He will ask you for a ride, but when you approach him he will point a gun at you and tell you to exit your vehicle. Do not attempt to drive away, since doing so will cause the event to be incomplete. It will also be incomplete if you let him drive away in your vehicle without killing him.
 This can be done by shooting him from within your vehicle, but if you exit your vehicle to shoot him you will need to kill him before he has a chance to escape. Alternatively, if you donâ€™t mind sacrificing your vehicle, you can let him take your vehicle and kill him by throwing a sticky bomb onto it and detonating it.When the prisoner dies, the event will be complete, and your only reward is the ammo he dropped.

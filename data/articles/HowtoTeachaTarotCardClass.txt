  Do you have techniques or talents that are unique to you? If so, you may want to focus on these to pass on to your students. One example would be if you have a method of teaching the Tarot that will help the student gain insight into the deck on level that would take years if they were to take the traditional path to learning?  If so, build a class on that method.;
,  Make point form notes, then expand them. Don't worry if you have no idea how your ideas are going to work, write all your thoughts as soon as they come to you.  Refine those brainstormed ideas into ones that you think your students would be able (and want) to learn.
  Some options that may work are a single session of 4 hours, a weekend encompassing 2 days, or a weekly class over the course of months.
 You will need to also consider refreshments, breaks (if you plan a longer session), and supplies (will they need their own cards?) Another consideration is cost. How much will you be charging?

,  Once you get it down to a tee, get a friend to play 'student' and teach your class to them. See if you get your message across in the time allotted, without wasting any, and your student seems pleased with what they've learned, and eager for more. Get feedback from your friend.
 Place an ad in the local paper, new age book store, flyers, etc. Too many people wait until the last minute, and that could mean a smaller attendance.
 This will allow you to relax before people start to arrive.

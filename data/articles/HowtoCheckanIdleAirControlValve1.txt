 A common symptom of a faulty idle control valve can be a high idle. Start the engine and look at the tachometer on the dashboard. Most vehicle’s engines will idle at our below one thousand RPMs. If you are familiar with your engine’s normal idle, compare that to its current RPMs.If the vehicle’s engine is idling well above 1,000 RPMs, it’s probably too high.
Vacuum leaks can also cause a high idle.;
, Aside from high idle issues, low idle and even sporadic stalling can both be attributed to a bad idle control valve. Again, start the engine and compare how it is running at a stop to how it normally runs. If the idle is low and inconsistent, it may be due to an issue with your idle control valve.
Low idles could also be caused by vacuum leaks.
 If your engine is idling poorly, try to diagnose any possible vacuum leaks that may be causing it. Visually inspect the vacuum lines in your engine bay for signs of damage such as cracks or overly worn areas.Remove a vacuum line and connect it to a vacuum gauge to measure the level and consistency of the vacuum.
You can also try spraying a soap and water mixture on the lines to look for bubbling at the point of a leak.
 The check engine light in your vehicle is designed to turn on if the Engine Control Unit (ECU) identifies an issues with how the engine is running. Look at your dashboard; if the check engine light is on in conjunction with idle issues, it may be because the idle control valve is malfunctioning.The check engine light looks like a simple drawing of an engine.
A check engine light in conjunction with idle issues can be indicative of a faulty idle control valve.

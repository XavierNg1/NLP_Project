 This method will reverse the discoloration that occurs due to sun exposure, but it does not remove grime. Follow one of the methods above first to get your bricks clean before you attempt this.


You do not need to dry your bricks before following these instructions.
 Sun exposure is an important part of this method, so use a glass or plastic container. Place it in an area with plenty of sun, but keep it away from children and pets, as non-edible materials will be used.


Because the hydrogen peroxide reacts with ultraviolet light, only sunlight or a UV lamp will work.
Do not use this method for parts with stickers and electrical parts.
 Use the standard 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, available in drug stores. You'll need enough to cover your discolored bricks.


Although 3% hydrogen peroxide is safe for skin contact, wear gloves and safety goggles to minimize exposure, and keep away from mouths and hair. Children should have an adult handle this for them.
 Some of your LEGO pieces may float in the hydrogen peroxide. Use any heavy object to weigh down the largest pieces., Stirring the small pieces around with a stick or gloved hand will dislodge the bubbles causing them to float. Try this every hour or so for best results. If you leave pieces floating too long, they can develop a cloudy white marking along the water line.If no bubbles form on the pieces after an hour, the hydrogen peroxide has broken down into mostly water. Dispose of the liquid down the drain and try again with a new bottle.
 This typically takes about four to six hours. This time varies depending on the strength of the sunlight and the age of the hydrogen peroxide. Once done, transfer the bricks to a colander, rinse them, and air dry.

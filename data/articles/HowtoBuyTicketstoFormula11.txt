 This calendar of events is available on the official Internet site of Formula 1. The official Formula 1 Internet site also lists the scheduled times for the Friday free practice sessions, the Saturday free practice and race qualifying sessions, and the Sunday race. There is some variation in race venues from year to year, so be sure to use the current race calendar.;
, The early season races will be more open to all competitors; while in the later races, the competition will increasingly focus on those who still have a chance to be world champion.
 The official Formula 1 Internet calendar will offer track maps for all events. These are not standard ovals, but rather complex courses with turns of varying difficulty and straights of varying lengths. Choose a slower, twisty track or a wide, high-speed track with long straights.
 Be aware that the typical weather expectations for each race venue will differ. For example, it may be hot at the Turkish Grand Prix and rainy at the Belgian Grand Prix.
 The need for passports and visas will vary from country to country, and advice from the appropriate embassy or national travel office should be obtained. Determine any other restrictions that may apply. For example, alcohol is illegal in Muslim countries.

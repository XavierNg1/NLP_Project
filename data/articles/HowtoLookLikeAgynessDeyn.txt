 Agyness is well known for her hair, a cute pixie crop bleached an ash blond. If you really want to go all out to achieve the Agnes look and you're feeling brave, then go for the chop as shown in these images. Spike it up sometimes, try a light forward "faux hawk" (Styling your hair into a Mohawk without actually shaving your head). To get this look, try some hair wax but make sure it's not too sticky, as this will make it harder. Try to avoid clear hair gels for this, as they will give you a wet look, whereas Agnes goes for the bed-head look.;
, Agnes clothing is eclectic. To copy her style, you can't go wrong with such clothing as braces, men's pants, bowler style hats, scarves, glasses, faded t-shirt and leather jackets. Try old style shoes and dresses worn with sneakers. Wear boyish clothes, but always team with something girlie. For instance, team a baggy boy's tee with skinny jeans; it's all about balance.
 Darken your eyebrows a little, even and perhaps especially, if your hair is bleach blond. Wear a little mascara and eyeliner and aim for a paler skin look. On occasions, try brighter lips with plainer clothes. Either a flawless face with a simple slick of liquid eyeliner, or a flawless face with red lipstick and no eye makeup. However, if you prefer wearing a fair amount of eyeshadow, take a look at her catwalk shows or clothes shoots for inspiration.
 If your outfits are looking a little bland after a while, accessorize with interesting objects. Maybe a guitar or an interesting vintage handbag. Also buy some union jack stickers and stick them on your guitar or transfer them onto clothes.

 Preheat the oven to 375° Fahrenheit or 190° degrees Celsius. Spray a 9 x 13 pan with non-stick greasing spray or melted butter.;
, In a large pot, pour 8 US quarts (8,000 ml) of water and have it boil. Sprinkle a pinch of salt. Boil the dry elbows to the amount of time directed on the package, usually taking about 7-10 minutes. The elbows should be slightly tender. Drain the pasta in a colander, but do not rinse.
 In four medium-sized bowls, divide the cheddar cheese into one cup for each bowl. Pour ¼ cup of heavy cream and milk into each of the bowls. Then add ⅛ teaspoon garlic powder and paprika to each of the four bowls. Season each bowl with a desired amount of salt and pepper.
 Split the pasta evenly and add them to each of the four balls. Add 8 drops of a different food coloring gel for each bowl. Use a spoon to combine the colors.
 Add each colored macaroni, one at a time, in the baking tray. Do not dunk all the macaroni at once. Keep the macaroni colors almost resembling a rainbow. Use a wooden spoon to help keep the colors separate.
 In the four Ziploc bags, divide the breadcrumbs by ¼ cup. Add 10 drops of each food gel into all four bags. Close them tightly and shake them so the color can blend in. Set aside.
 Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over each correctly colored section of macaroni. Place the baking tray in the oven. Have the macaroni bake for about 20-25 minutes, until it starts to slightly bubble and the top is golden brown. Remove the macaroni from the oven once fully cooked.
 Have the macaroni and cheese cool for about 5-8 minutes. Slice the macaroni and place it on a serving plate. Serve.

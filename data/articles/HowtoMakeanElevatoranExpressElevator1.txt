 In some elevators, simply pressing your floor and holding it will do the trick. You have to hold the button all the way to your floor., When you get on the elevator, press the "Close Door" button. Often, this button will be two triangles pointing in towards each other. Continue holding the "Close Door" button as you push your floor. In some elevators, this combination will give you an express ride.This combination often works on Otis, Desert, and Dover elevators.
Note that sometimes the "Close Door" button is just a placebo for impatient riders, so this trick may not work.
 In some elevators, you can cancel floors that have already been pressed. Of course, if people see you do so, they will probably not be very happy. Or, they may press their floor button again. The simplest method is to double press the button, which works in Mitsubishi Electric. In other brands, such as Fujitec, pressing it five times works. Another method is to hold the "Open Door" button while pressing the floor button twice., Some people suggest that you can use your foot to keep the door from opening. Simply put your foot on the middle of the elevator door, covering the edges of the door. In theory, the sole of your shoe will keep the door from opening on floors., If you're cozy with your building manager, you may be able to get the secret elevator code from him or her. However, you may need to promise to use it only for good.

Release your shoulders and slowly lift and lower your thighs from the saddle. When the horse has stopped moving, stretch your back forward toward the saddle horn and backward, and be sure to flex your ankles., Speaking in a pleasant, gentle voice has a calming influence on horses. A stern, low tone has been shown to increase a horse’s heart rate and cause distress.Be sure to speak to your horse in a calm, friendly manner to keep the horse's heart rate down and create a safe, pleasant environment.

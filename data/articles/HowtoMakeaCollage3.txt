 Look in your own fabric supplies, in your wardrobe for unwanted clothing, in thrift stores and in craft stores for great sources of fabric. Some examples include:


Leftover scraps from sewing projects
Cut-outs of fabric designs that you love
Cut-outs from beloved pieces of clothing that are past their wearing date (great for memory sakes of children's clothing)
Quilt fabrics/fat quarters
Special fabrics like tulle, organdy, silk, satin, etc.
Thread, wool, yarn, string, ribbons, lace, netting, etc.
Sewing embellishments such as buttons, sequins, sew-on patches, etc.
 Fabrics tend to come in a range of textures and thicknesses, meaning that you'll need to incorporate these differences to best effect in the collage.
 There are some suggestions for backgrounds outlined above but always bear in mind that fabric may stick differently from paper, so not all options will be useful. Do a test glue on the background you'd like to use before proceeding, to make sure that the fabric will stay in place. Some ideas for backgrounds include: other fabric, an unwanted wall-hanging, an item of unwanted clothing, paper or cardboard, an object such as an old stuffed toy needing a facelift or a lampshade, etc.


Use clear drying glue that is suitable for both fabric and the backing you're using.
 For design ideas, see the suggestions outlined in the method above for making a paper collage. Once you have a design in mind, match the appropriately textured and colored fabric pieces accordingly., It's fine to stick one piece on top of another, so be bold.


Keep the textures in mind when creating impressions of items, animals or faces. For example, use wool or fluffed up fabric to create a sheep's body or use yarn to create hair around a face.
Wool, thread or yarn can be wound around in spirals to create flowers, a sun or moon, faces, etc.
Buttons and sequins are great for all sorts of image creation, such as making flowers, eyes on a face or animal shapes.
 Place on display.

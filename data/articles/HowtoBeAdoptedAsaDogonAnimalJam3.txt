 They may have a daughter or son who wants a pet, they might have a house of pets, or they might just want a pet for themselves. I try to go for the adopters who just want a pet for themselves. You are, of course, allowed to have a different opinion.
 Play games like 'fetch' with them and be nice to them. Do normal dog things like eating kibble, sleeping, sipping your water, and playing with dog toys, but don't throw up your kibble all over your bed and toys, then pretend to keep getting sick.
 Your owner will always give you bandages or medicine. But if you keep pretending to be sick, they might send you away, delete you, or give up and leave you sick. Just pretend to heal right away and go back to normal as if nothing happened.

 Almost any shirt lends itself to becoming sleeveless, but there are some common options.


T-shirts
Old blouses
Long-sleeved shirts;
, It is important that the surface is flat so that you cut the shirt evenly.
 This is why the shirt needs to be inside out, so you can see the seam more clearly.Use sharp scissors to cut many strips into the sleeves, cutting straight up to the shoulder seam and stopping.
When you are done, the sleeves should look like fringe hanging from the shirt.
This helps the shirt lose its curve around the shoulder seam so that it lays flatter and allows for a straighter cut.
 Using your scissors, make your way around the seam cutting off each strip carefully, as close to the edge as possible.


Avoid cutting into the shoulder seam, because that will cause fraying and may cause the shirt to unravel later.
Pull the strips tight as you cut, which will help make a clean, straight cut.
 If you do have any straggling threads or uneven edges, you'll want to remove those with the scissors in order to avoid fraying and unraveling later.


Take your scissors carefully along the edge at the shoulder seam, trimming up anything that needs to be cleaned up.
Your shirt is now sleeveless but still has the seams intact in order to help the shirt last longer. When the seams are cut off, the shirt tends to come apart quickly.

 Make a very neat knot. Do this for each rose you're making, then you can decide whether or not to build a bouquet or use the roses individually.


You may have leaf stems underneath the flower, but leave them intact in case you want to join the roses to create a bouquet or you'd like to affix the roses to fabric or d√©cor.

 Lay the trout flat against the cutting board with the backbone facing towards you. Run the blade of your knife all the way along the spine. Set the first fillet aside, then flip the fish over and repeat on the opposite side.Cut using long, smooth strokes with the knife rather than short, jagged ones. This will make the resulting fillets come away cleaner with less wasted meat.
Press down on the fish with your non-cutting hand to help hold it place while you work the first fillet free.
 There will likely be traces of fat and cartilage clinging to either edge of the fillets where they were attached to the belly and backbone. To get rid of these bits, point the tip of the knife downwards against the cutting board and trace along the outline of the extra tissue. Carefully cut away any tissue you find that isn't usable meat.The white fat and cartilage will usually stand out against the darker meat of the trout.
These tissues tend to be tough and chewy, even after cooking, and can ruin the velvety texture of the trout if not properly trimmed.
 Using a pair of tweezers, go through and pluck out each of the tiny pinbones, or the ribs of the trout. Push down gently on the meat around the bones to expose the tip, then get a good grip and tug until the entire bone slides out. If you wait until after you've filleted the trout to extract the bones, they'll no longer be anchored in place and shouldn't give you any trouble.Pull out the pinbones in the direction they run through the fillet (not straight up) to prevent them from breaking accidentally.If you don't have a pair of tweezers on hand, you can also use another thin, pointed tool, such as needle-nosed pliers or the tines of a fork.

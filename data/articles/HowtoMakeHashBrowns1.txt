 Wash the potatoes well in cold water, then peel using a small knife or a vegetable peeler. Russet potatoes, or other potatoes with a high starch content, work best for hash browns.;
, Line a bowl with a clean dishtowel, then shred the potatoes directly into the towel-lined bowl, using a cheese grater.
 You must squeeze out as much moisture as possible from the shredded potatoes. This is the most important step in achieving crispy (rather than mushy) hash browns. To do this, gather the corners of the dishtowel containing the shredded potatoes and twist the neck until you form a tight package. Continue twisting the cloth and squishing the potato in your fist until you've squeezed as much liquid as you can from the potato.


Alternatively, you can try squeezing the moisture from the potatoes using a potato ricer. You do not need to force the potatoes through the ricer, simply use it to press out the moisture.
 Heat a large skillet pan (preferably cast iron) over a medium-high heat. Add the butter to the pan and allow to melt. Once the butter has melted, add the dry, shredded potatoes to the pan and toss to coat with butter. Season with salt and pepper.
 Once the potato has been coated with butter, flatten it using a spatula to maximize contact with the hot pan. It should be no more than 1/2 an inch thick. Cook for 3-4 minutes on the first side, flip, then cook for 2-3 minutes on the other side. The hash brown potatoes are ready when each side is crisp and golden brown.
 Slide the hash brown from the pan, or lift using a large spatula. Cut it into halves or quarters, if necessary. Serve on its own, with hot sauce or ketchup, or alongside bacon and eggs for a top notch breakfast.

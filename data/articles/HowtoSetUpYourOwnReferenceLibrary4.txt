 You should also aim to keep the books in an environment that is not too humid or too dry to discourage mold, fungus and infestation. Use a dehumidifier in the summer and a humidifier in the winter to keep books from molding or drying out.
 As well as an aesthetic problem, dust attracts moisture, mildew and book lice.
 Many of these animals are attracted to dust, glue and paper. They eat through the books, spines and often leave their waste on the pages. If you find an infestation, consult a professional exterminator before they destroy too many books.


If you believe the pest problem only extends to 1 or 2 books, place each 1 in a plastic freezer bag. Remove as much air as possible and seal it well. Leave them in the freezer for a day to kill the insects. Then clean out the book as thoroughly as possible.

 Simply roll the fondant into a ball, small or big, as required. Use the palm of your hands and move the fondant in a circular motion to form the ball.


Balls can be cut in halves and quarters.
To make smaller balls, divide in half again and again and keep rolling.
 There are various simple shapes that you can roll or stretch the ball into:


Teardrop: Roll one end of the ball back and forth until it becomes elongated and thinner than the other end.
Cone: Roll one end of the ball into a V shape.
Sausage: Roll the whole ball on a flat surface, rolling back and forth until both sides are the same and a sausage shape forms.
Tube: Make a sausage and just keep on rolling until the fondant gets skinnier and a tube forms.
Pinch in either end of a cone or sausage to make an interesting shape for working with.

 This move works your legs, shoulders, butt, and abs. Hold your arms out straight in front of you. Jog in place, doing high knees (you touch knees to hands) for 10 seconds. Drop in a 'frog crouch' position. Put legs behind you so you're in a push-up position. Jump straight up, into starting position. Do this 15 times at least. It should be one motion.
 This one's a big abdominal workout! It stretches or hamstrings, too. Lie on your back with hands under butt, elbows bent. Raise your legs up straight above you, like an 'L'. Push feet towards ceiling, raising hips and butt off the floor (use your abs). Lower to start position. Do 15 reps.
 Work your abs more for a strong, flat tummy! Get in a sit-up position, but with the bottoms of your feet pushed together, and your knees pointed out. Put your hands behind your head, and do a crunch. Do 15.
 Go outside. Go running/jogging. Take more walks. Ride your bike around.

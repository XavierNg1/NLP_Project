 This will create the base for your milkshake. You can also use chocolate ice cream instead for a different twist. For an extra special treat, try chocolate ice cream that has chocolate sauce or caramel swirled into it.
 You can use any type of milk you like: non-fat, 2%, or whole. For a thinner milkshake, use up to 1 cup (240 milliliters) of milk. You will be adding a frozen banana to the milkshake, which will thicken it up considerably.
 If you are using vanilla ice cream, you can also try some honey or caramel instead. For the peanut butter, make sure that you are using the smooth, creamy kind and not the chunky kind. It will be easier to blend and give you a smoother treat in the end.
 This will not only give your milkshake an extra burst of flavor, but it will also replace the ice and give the milkshake some extra thickness.
 Keep blending until the banana has completely broken up. There should be no lumps, clumps, streaks, or swirls. If the milkshake is not blending well enough, pause the blender, and use a rubber spatula to scrape any unblended milkshake down the sides of the canister and towards the bottom.
 For an extra special touch, garnish it with a swirl of whipped cream on top and a drizzle of chocolate sauce. Place a thin banana slice on the rim and pop in a straw.

 Most Robloxians use cuss words, but remember that Roblox is for people of the ages 8-22+. There are little kids playing, too, and you don't want to ruin their childhood. There is a filter in place that stops most swear words, and no harm will come to you if you make sure your swear words are filtered in Studio first (an easy way is to make a script that prints your chat messages to the debug console).;
, Don't talk about drugs, sex, gangs, hacking, etc. If you do so, players will find out and report you to Roblox.


Remember that Roblox can read the chat log for proof. If you make games about sex, you will have a 98% chance that your game will be taken down and will be either warned or banned once the Roblox staff receives a complaint from a user about your sexual games and has been reviewed.
 If you tell everyone that you're an admin, they will probably not believe you. If you have read Roblox's safety rules, they say that if anyone claims to say they're the administrator when they aren't, players will have to report them and Roblox will check the bad behavior out. However, it may not apply to anyone with admin scripts used for a specific game.
 Similarly, do not exploit bugs on the website that give you unfair advantages on purpose and claiming you're the game's admin.
 Many players say, "Builderman gave me a hack to give me 9999999 robux, copy and paste this on 8 hats, log in and log out and you'll get the robux". It's not true, though; how could you get robux just for copy, pasting, logging in and out? If you do that, you'll make yourself look like a fool! Don't ask players for their password or they will report you.

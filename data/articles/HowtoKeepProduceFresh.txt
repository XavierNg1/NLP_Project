 The more often you buy produce throughout the week, the better chance you have of purchasing fresh stock.;
, Damaged produce will rapidly decay because once broken leaves and skin are exposed to air, spoilage will occur. If produce in your refrigerator is damaged, consume it sooner than undamaged items.
 Fragile produce such as lettuce should be eaten sooner than heartier items like potatoes.
 Some produce should not be refrigerated until ripened, like nectarines. Other produce needs a climate controlled storage environment as quickly as possible, such as carrots, which should go into the bin as soon as you bring it home from the store.
 Punch several holes in the plastic bags to allow them to breathe.
 Because mushrooms will spoil in humid conditions created by plastic bags, keeping them in a paper bag will absorb excess humidity and reduce spoilage.
 Berries are fragile and will quickly deteriorate when exposed to air. Storing them inside a sealed container will minimize produce spoilage due to excess handling and opening and closing of the refrigerator door., Ideally you'll have 2 climate controlled bins; a low humidity one for hard vegetables and fruit with low water content, and a high humidity one for salad greens, herbs and leafy greens like Swiss chard.
, Do not store them together on the same shelf since onions will cause potatoes to sprout.
 These produce items emit ethylene, an invisible and odorless gas that causes rapid ripening. Store them on the counter top.

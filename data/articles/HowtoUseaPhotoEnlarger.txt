 You may do this by looking through your negative strips.;
,, This piece opens up wide, which then has two square holes. This is where your desired image will be. Put your chosen picture onto the slide, close it and put it back into the enlarger. The slide goes into the front, or side depending on the type of enlarger being used.
 On both sides of the enlarger, there will be knobs. Turn the knobs to lower or heighten the enlarger so as to make the image fit the two black pieces that make your 8x10 spacing on your easel.
 Each enlarger has a lens which have f/stops that you may choose from. By looking at your contact sheet, you can get an idea as to how bright or dark you would like your image to be. Once you have decided, twist the lens to choose an f/stop. Turn the enlarger off. Make sure you choose the correct f/stop. Choosing the wrong one could ruin your image completely and re-exposing will need to take place with a different piece of paper.
 You may leave the amber lights on if you wish. Grab a piece of paper and put it into the easel. Make sure that it fits with your measurements.
 Set your timer. Most images only require seconds worth of exposure, unless they are severely underdeveloped, then they could require up to 30 minutes at times. Once the time is set the enlarger will begin to expose the light through the negative, transferring the image onto the paper.
 Put it in the wash basin. Make sure all the chemicals have been removed. You may use your hands to aid in the wash process. If they are not removed, the photo will eventually turn a purplish color. This has happened on occasion. After washing, try placing them on your bathroom walls if they are made of tile, or you may use any other walls that have tile, and squeegee the water off of them. Hang them to dry. Be careful not to use paper towels to dry them or you will have sticky paper towel pieces on your images.

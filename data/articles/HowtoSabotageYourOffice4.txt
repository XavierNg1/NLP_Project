 Cancelling utility services and suddenly breaking existing contracts will sabotage your office and create confusion.


Disconnect Internet services and other utilities, such as electrical, gas and water service.
Call the phone company and have the office phone numbers changed. Also, consider requesting a different area code, if available. If your office uses cell phones, change all the plans to a very limited number of minutes and remove texting capabilities, or cancel the phone service altogether.
Cancel planned advertising campaigns and contracts, and eagerly agree to pay any related fees.

 To avoid bacterial infection of your beer, every piece of equipment that touches the liquid will need to be thoroughly cleaned. Before brewing, clean each piece of equipment with a specialized brewery cleaner. The most popular product is PBW (which stand for powdered brewery wash), and is available from brewing supply shops like Northern Brewer or More Beer.;
, Cleaning the equipment only helps you to break up grime and residue; sanitizing to kill microbial life is the next important step. Sanitize all of the equipment with a no-rinse brewery sanitizer. StarSan and QuickSan are 2 very popular products for this task.
 The rule when selecting water for brewing beer is: if it tastes good alone, it will taste good in your beer. If you are happy with the taste of your tap water, you can use it for your beer. Otherwise, buy about 6 gallons (22.7Â L) of spring water from the store. Do not use distilled water, which lacks the trace minerals that can smoothen your beer's flavor.
 Because yeast are living organisms, they must be stored in your refrigerator until needed. Before brewing, however, give them a couple hours out on the countertop so that they will be at room temperature when you need them. This "wakes them up" a bit and prevents them from being shocked by a dramatic swing in temperature.

 The more weight the rabbit carries on her body, the more weight she has pressing down on her feet. Sore hocks are rare in wild rabbits, as are obese rabbits. Take care not to overfeed your rabbit and to keep her lean.


The perfect food for rabbits is grass or a good quality green hay. Feed your rabbit hay as the majority of your rabbit's food.
Only give a spoonful of pellets as an extra treat. Be aware that pellets are very calorie heavy, and feeding them as meals instead of treats makes it more likely your rabbit will overeat and become obese.
If your rabbit is already too heavy, start a gradual change over from pellets to hay. Don't make any sudden changes since this could cause your rabbit to starve themself, which can cause health problems.
 Long claws can lead to sore hocks. If the claws of the back legs grow too long and the rabbit then walks on a hard surface, the claws have the effect of raising the toes and lowering the hocks. This then forces more pressure onto the hocks, increasing the abrasive forces and creating sore hocks.This problem is easily sorted by regularly trimming your rabbit's nails. If you do not feel confident doing this, then a groomer or your vet can do this for a small fee. They can also show you what to do.
 Rabbits who donâ€™t move often can get sore hocks. For example, rabbits with arthritis or with other muscular or skeletal problems may be in pain when they move, which makes them more likely to stay in one spot. This kind of behavior can predispose the bunny to sore hocks.If arthritis is the problem, speak to your vet about prescribing a painkilling medication that is safe for rabbits, in order to ease your pet's discomfort and encourage them to move around.

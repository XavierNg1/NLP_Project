 RPM stands for rotations per minute and tracks how fast your tires are rotating. The tachometer, or the meter that reads your car's RPM, is usually found next to your speedometer and has numbers from 0 to 9. Once the needle on this meter is between 2,500 to 3,000, you should begin to upshift.
 Use your foot to depress the clutch pedal while at the same time slowly lifting off the gas. This will free up your stick shift and allow you to slide it into the next gear. During this time your car will go into a neutral state, and you'll notice your engine revving if your foot is pressed too hard on the gas.
 Shift into the next highest gear as you're pushing the clutch down to the floor. If you're in first gear, you will move the stick shift into second gear. This should happen in one fluid motion, so don't hesitate for too long.








Practice shifting while your vehicle is off so that you get used to the pattern of the gears.
 Once you've moved up into the next gear, you can start to slowly lift off the clutch while giving your car more gas. If done correctly, the car should start to accelerate again and the RPM should go back down.








Your car won't stall when shifting higher than first gear because it's already moving.

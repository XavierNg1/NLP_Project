 Use either dried chamomile flowers or 3 to 4 teabags to brew a very strong pot of tea. Allow it to cool once it has brewed. It should not be so hot to the touch it causes pain, as you'll be applying this to your scalp., Stand over the sink and pour the tea over your hair if you'd like to lighten your hair all over. Alternatively, apply the chamomile tea to the strands of your hair you wish to highlight.
 Allow the tea to dry in your hair by sitting out in the sun. There is no precise amount of time to sit, although longer is generally better., Rinse the tea from your hair. Then, wash and condition it with moisturizing products. When your hair is dry, you'll see mild lightening and some highlights.
 You're unlikely to see dramatic results with chamomile tea right away. Chamomile usually gradually lightens your hair over time. You may need to try this method a few days in a row to get your desired results.

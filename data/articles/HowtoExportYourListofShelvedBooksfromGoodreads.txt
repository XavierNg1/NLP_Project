Click the My Books link at the top of the page.
Click the "import/export" link in the left-hand column of page links from the page that comes up.
 This button will be located over on the right hand side of the page underneath the "Export Your Books" title/label.
 As the download begins, the page refreshes and shows an updated button. Once the downloaded file arrives, the "Export Library" button will jump down a line and a new line of the exported datasheet will be displayed.


For large accounts with hundreds to thousands of books, this may take several minutes, but for those that have fewer (about 50-75 shelved books), this should take just a few seconds.
 This link is your downloadable CSV file, which you can view in most spreadsheet programs and some super-simple word processing programs.
 Although the downloaded file location will vary from computer to computer, most often you will find it in your Downloads folder.
 Click the "Open" (or similar) button on the download box that pops up for the downloaded file.
 You may just need the title and author, but there are other columns as well, containing the Goodreads-ID number for the book, ISBN or ASIN number of the book (dependent on format of the book item you shelved), the type of books, number of pages, and some publication data. If you've rated, reviewed, or organized the books, you'll also see some of the text to the review you might have written, your ratings for these books, and the shelves the books have been placed on, as well as date added and date read dates and several other rarely-used pieces of information.

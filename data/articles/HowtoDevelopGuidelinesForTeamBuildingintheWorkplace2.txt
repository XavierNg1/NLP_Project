 Rules might include listening when other team members are talking, contributing during team meetings, speaking honestly and refraining from using belittling or offensive language.


Decide how to increase individual contributions during team discussions. Whether over email, during conference calls or in person, team members must feel that their opinions are important. You might call on individuals to contribute during meetings, or email them ahead of time to ask that they prepare and deliver a team report.
Define all relevant language and terminology. For example, you might agree as a group to use acronyms to increase efficiency in communications. Give team members from different departments a chance to ask questions and gain clarity about unfamiliar expressions and terminology.
Prevent the same 1 or 2 people from dominating team meetings. Set time limits on how long each person speaks, or specifically ask quieter team members to present or lead a discussion.

 Lens sizes are expressed in diameters, which are usually listed on top of the camera lenses. The unit of measure is in millimeters.


Screw-on filters can only fit on lenses with the exact measurements.
 Filter adapters, whether step-down or step-up, can allow filters of a different size to be used on a lens. However, do note that vignetting may occur as the filters may block light at the edges.

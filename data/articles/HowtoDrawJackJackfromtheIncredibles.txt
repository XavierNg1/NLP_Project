 This image shows Jack Jack in what could be viewed as either a sitting or a crawling position. The guidelines are as follows:


A circle for the head
A line for the body
Simple lines for legs and feet
A horseshoe curving around the body line for the arms, ending in small hand lines.;
, The shapes are as follows:


A larger circle to depict the baby's traditionally larger head; pencil in eye level and mouth level guidelines as well
A small neck shape overlapping the head and body
A circle for the body
Two ovals to form each arm with a circle end for the hands then sausage shapes for the fingers, resting on the ground
Circles for the legs and feet.
 This is the time to create the cuteness. Draw large eyes with the eyebrows situated way above, as shown. Draw an open, smiling mouth.


Add ears
Define the roundness of the face
Add a wee nose line
Don't forget that pointed hairstyle!

, Add the hands and shoe-covered feet.
 Erase all of the guidelines.
 Use the suggested colors in the image as guidance. Once colored in, you're all done and you've just drawn one of the cutest animated babies ever!

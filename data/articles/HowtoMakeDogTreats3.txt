, Place the flour, baking soda, peanut butter, oil, egg, honey and peanuts in a large mixing bowl. Use a spoon to mix the ingredients until they are fully incorporated.


If your dog likes vanilla and other sweet flavors, add a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of sugar to the batter and mix well.
If your dog likes carrots, add 1/2 cup of shaved carrots to the mix.
 Use a spoon to scoop the batter into the cake pan, then smooth the surface so the cake cooks evenly.
 Place the pan in the oven and bake the cake for 40 minutes, or until the top is lightly brown.


Check the cake to make sure it's fully cooked by inserting a toothpick into the middle. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is ready. If it comes out coated in batter, bake the cake for another 10 minutes.
When the cake is done, remove it from the oven and allow it to cool.
 When the cake has cooled, invert it onto a plate or doggy dish. Scoop the cottage cheese onto the cake and spread it around with a spoon.


If your dog doesn't like cottage cheese, you can also ice the cake with cream cheese or mashed bananas.
Don't ice the cake with regular cake icing, since it might hurt the dog's stomach.
 Serve the cake whole and let your dog dig right in, or cut it into slices and save some for later. Refrigerate any leftover cake.

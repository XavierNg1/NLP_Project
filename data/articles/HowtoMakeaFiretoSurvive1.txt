Fire has three principle uses in a survival situation:

Cooking
Signaling
Warmth


Wood used for a fire can be broken into the following categories:

Tinder - Dry and fluffy wood shavings, cedar bark, or even dryer lint.
Kindling - Small twigs and splinters of wood.
Fuel wood - Branches smaller than your wrist.
Logs - Not used in any survival scenarios but nice for cabins.

 Let it meet other dogs from a very early point in its life. Doing this allows your dog to become more social and also lets it experience life outside the house.


Take your dog to town now and then so it doesn't become scared of cars, lights, noises, and other people. Also expose them early to other things that can rile up small dogs, such as skateboards and bicycles. The more they see and interact with a variety of life experiences, the more comfortable they should be.
 They can have a 'holier than thou' attitude, which makes it a bit tougher to train them. Be patient, and stay consistent.


In particular Shih Tzus are notorious for having house breaking problems.Use positive reinforcement, not punishment, and stay patient with your dog.
 This breed tends to chew a lot in their early years, but with proper training, you can stop the habit.


Remember that no matter what, your Shih Tzu will bite in the early stages. It's completely normal, but don't let him/her get used to it!

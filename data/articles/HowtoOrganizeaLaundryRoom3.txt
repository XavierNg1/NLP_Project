 If you have a spacious laundry room, consider placing a table large enough for sorting and folding clothes in the room. The table can also double as a workspace for wrapping gifts, completing school projects, or making art.
 If you are crunched for space, consider installing a foldout shelf on the wall or door. You can use the shelf to sort and fold laundry. When you finish sorting and folding the clothes, you can fold the shelf back up against the wall.
 You can transform the tops of your washing machine and dryer into a usable workspace with a butcher block. Put the butcher block directly on the machines and use it to sort and fold laundry., If you do a lot of ironing, you can create a collapsible workspace by hanging an ironing board. Try hanging the board on a wall or on the back of a door. When you are done ironing, fold the board back up against the door or wall.
 Having a trash can set up in your workspace will help you handle lint, used dryer sheets, and other garbage efficiently. Try setting up a trash can near the laundry machines. For example, you can slide the trash can between the wall and the washing machine or dryer.

 Read about every location you plan to visit, focusing on information related to your travel goals. For example, if your goal is to study Spanish for a year in 5 or 6 countries in South America, gather information about the language schools. If you intend to travel and work abroad, investigate work authorizations and tax laws.
 Try to bring along a guidebook for every destination you plan to visit, in case you do not have Internet access or other ways of accessing information while away.
 Friends, relatives and colleagues are sometimes the best sources for travel information. Ask them about any travel risks and the names of their favorite hotels, restaurants and activities.

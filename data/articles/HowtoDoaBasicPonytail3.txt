 Begin by using a rattail comb to create a deep side part. Start the part above your right or left eyebrow, then angle it towards the back-center of your head. Brush your hair away from the side part, then pull it back into a low ponytail.









You can also create a center part instead.
 If you want a more vintage look, suitable for anything 80s, try making a high ponytail on the side of your head. If you have curly or wavy hair, you can make a low ponytail to one side of your head.
 Make a L-shape with both of your hands. Position them at your temples, by your eyebrows. Tuck your thumbs under your hair, then pull your hair back into a mid-high ponytail. Use your hands to smooth down the hair on the top and sides of the ponytail, then tie it off.
 Start with a half-up, half-down ponytail. Tie it off with a clear elastic, or use one that matches your hair color. Next, gather all of your hair into a low ponytail and tie it off with another elastic. Use a hair tie that matches your hair color.
 Take some hair from your part, and braid it into a thin braid, no wider than your finger. Next, gather all of your hair, including the braid, into a mid-height ponytail, and secure it with a hair tie. Wrap a thin strand of hair, around the base of your ponytail to high the hair tie. Secure it with a bobby pin.








If your hair is straight of smooth, secure the end of the thin braid with an elastic. Remove the elastic at the end.You can also wrap the thin braid around the base of the ponytail instead. Remove the elastic (if you used it) before pinning the braid.

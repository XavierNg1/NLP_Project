 Look for the Facebook app on your mobile device. It’s the one with the app icon with the Facebook logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 If you logged out of your previous Facebook session, you will be asked to log in. Enter your registered email address and password into the fields provided, and tap “Log in” to access your account.
 Tap your name on the header toolbar, and you will be brought to your Timeline screen. Your current cover photo is clearly displayed at the top part of the screen.
 Tap your current cover photo, and a short menu will appear. Tap on “Upload Photo,” and your mobile device’s media gallery or camera roll will be brought up.


Tap the folder where the photo you want to be used as your new cover photo is located. Browse through your pictures, and tap the one you want to use to upload it.
 Once it’s uploaded, you can immediately preview your new cover photo. You will be given an option to reposition your photo. Tap and drag the photo to reposition it properly. Since the cover photo is horizontal, you have to ensure that the area covered can fit in the allocated cover photo box.
 This will save the new cover photo you’ve uploaded. It will also be saved under your “Cover photos” album on Facebook.

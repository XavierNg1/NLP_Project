 You may wish to simply monitor your dog’s physical location, for which you don’t need a health monitor. GPS trackers, on the other hand, use a network of global positioning satellites to monitor and store your dog’s literal movements and location.You can get devices that do it all - both health monitoring and GPS tracking - or devices that simply track your dog’s location. Note that the latter can still help you keep track of your dog’s physical activity by noting the distances they travel, etc.
 Many GPS trackers monitor another helpful environmental factor: the ambient air temperature wherever your dog might be. This is important to several reasons. Primarily, you can make sure your dog is never at risk of freezing or overheating.Further, when you simply run to the store and leave your dog in the crate, you can make sure the heat doesn’t cut out at home and put them in danger. You can change the setting on most models to alert you if a certain temperature threshold is broken.
 Another important feature that GPS collars offer is the ability to set “home boundaries” for your dog. If these boundaries are crossed, the corresponding app can alert you on your phone. If you’re taking them out, there’s no issue - but if you let them home with your little brother, you might want to call and make sure Jabba the Mutt didn’t escape again.

 A bow is just as fragile as it looks. Take care in handling your violin.;
, Be careful not to make it too tight or loose, see "Tips" for a method of checking if the tightness is good.
 If your hands are sweaty, wet, or it is just hard to spin the screw, try putting your shirt, or a piece of cloth over it. The process should be much easier.
 This is called the "rosin." Make sure that the surface is rough and grainy so that the grains get into the bow hairs. If it is not, then file it with a nail file or sandpaper.
 You are welcome to do more. Some do more than 20. See the effects of different amounts of rosin in the "Tips" section.
 You have prepared your bow and now it is time to play that wonderful music!

1 3/4 cups of confectioners' sugar
1 3/4 cups of shredded coconut
1 cup of chopped almonds
1/2 cup of sweetened condensed milk
2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips

, Combine these ingredients in a large bowl until they form a sticky mixture.

Use your hands to divide the mixture into 1 inch (2.5Â cm) balls, then place them on a greased cookie sheet and leave to chill in the refrigerator for approximately 20 minutes.
 While the coconut candies are chilling, place the chocolate chips in a microwaveable bowl and microwave on high power for one minute. Stir the chocolate, then continue to microwave for 10 to 20 second intervals until the chocolate is completely melted., Once the coconut candies of hardened, dip them into the melted chocolate, then allow the excess to drip off. Place the chocolate-covered candies on a cookie sheet lined with waxed paper. If you like, you can sprinkle some extra shredded coconut or flaked almonds on top, to decorate. Allow the chocolate to set before devouring!

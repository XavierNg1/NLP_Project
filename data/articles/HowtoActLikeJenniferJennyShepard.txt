 Jenny was a very strong and determined person. She stood up for herself and wouldn't give up.;
, Jenny was stubborn. Don't be stubborn and stupid, just stubborn. Don't let people change your mind.
 Jenny wasn't liked by the other agencies. This was because she wanted to be in the loop about everything. Basically if people don't like you, don't change. She still wanted to be in the loop and didn't seem to care.
 Jenny wasn't girly. She was always up for an argument and wouldn't be bothered about getting muddy or wet.
 Stay in shape. Basically have some way to protect yourself. Maybe just go to a gym, but make sure you are strong as Jenny wasn't a weak girl.
 Jenny didn't make excuses. If she got something wrong, she admitted it. You should too. Don't make excuses or blame others.
 Jenny normally wore a shirt and trousers, occasionally a blazer.
 She wouldn't wear a lot. She always looked natural.
 Jenny did this when going to nice places. People will think just because she isn't girly or because she is an agent, she wouldn't wear things like that. She did and would.
 Of course, you don't want to change who you are - but you can find inspiration in her character traits and style.

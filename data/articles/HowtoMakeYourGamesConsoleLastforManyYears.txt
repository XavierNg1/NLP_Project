 Never leave a disc inside the console when you are not using it, and always put a disc back in its case. Do not play with the discs, otherwise it will get scratched.;
, If you are not going to use your console for a very long time, unplug it and pack it away in its box. Take all discs and/or memory cards and/or controllers or other devices, and put them in appropriate storage places.
 This can harm the contents of the disk and corrupt game saves, and other files that are important.
 This may warp the exterior, and damage delicate internal components. The same goes for extreme cold. Just keep your console at room-temperature.
 You must not drop it, as doing so will damage delicate parts that make the console work properly. Also, do not drop controllers, DVD remotes, or other devices.
 The lens is what reads the discs you insert, and touching it will stop it from reading them properly. The lens is one of the most vital parts that keep the system working properly.
 The console's air intake will 'breathe' your smoke, which will clog up the airflow, causing dust to build up. Without proper ventilation, any electrical appliance will overheat, and will break it. Be sure to wipe the air intake fan every once in a while, to get rid of the dust.
 If you think your console feels too warm, switch it off, and do not play on it again until it is cool again.
 Refer to the console's instruction manual to find out how to clean it.

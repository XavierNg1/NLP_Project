 Reputable providers, such as McAfee, Norton Anti-Virus, AVG, Avast, and Windows Security Essentials provide similar protection but have different views on how to scan for malware. These guidelines use a free product available for download at AVG. Just follow the recommended installation instructions and your computer will be protected.;
, Common malware removal tools are Spybot Search & Destroy, SuperAntiSpyware, Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, and many others that you may find by searching. Again, the example is from Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware.
 Open the Start Menu and navigate to Control Panel. Open System and Security and click Firewall.

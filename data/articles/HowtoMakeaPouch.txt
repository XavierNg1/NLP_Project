 Be sure to choose your size and material wisely.


Avoid choosing a fabric that is to sheer or flimsy, unless you intend to make a sturdier lining.
Avoid using a piece of fabric that is too big, but you can always cut it to size. Avoid using a piece of fabric that is too small.;
,, If your fabric has a "right side" and a "wrong side," make sure that the right sides will end up on the outside of the pouch.
 If you want to, you can include a clasp or closure. At this step, you could also decorate and personalize your pouch.

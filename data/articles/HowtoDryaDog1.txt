 This is the easiest and most enjoyable way for the dog to dry. After getting wet, the natural reaction of many dogs is to shake from side to side with great vigor to release the water. In less than 4 seconds of shaking, dogs can shake up to 70% of the water from their fur., It is best to do this outdoors or in a room that you don't mind gets wet. Be prepared for the dog to shake water all over you, as well. Wear clothes you do not mind getting wet.
 Outdoors in the sunshine may be most enjoyable for the dog.


If you allow the dog to dry outdoors, make sure you provide water and shade for the dog.
Dogs prefer natural odors to man made ones, like those found in shampoo, so a recently bathed dog will likely wish to roll in the dirt or mud.Prevent your dog from getting him/herself dirty and smelly by keeping the dog in a place without mud, dirt, or other smelly/rotting materials until the dog is completely dry. A deck or patio outdoors would work well, or a comfortable indoor room.
If you bring the dog indoors to dry, the dog may roll around on the carpet. That is a natural reaction, so either allow your dog to enjoy that, or put the dog in a room without carpet if you do not wish the dog to roll on the carpet.

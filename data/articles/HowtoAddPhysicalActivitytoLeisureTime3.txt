 A sedentary lifestyle and inadequate physical exercise have been linked to numerous health problems, some potentially fatal, including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. The majority of adults worldwide do not participate in adequate amounts of activity.Activity during leisure time is a great way to combat this statistic and keep your body healthy.
Physical activity doesn’t need to be exercise-based, necessarily. While exercise focuses on repeated strenuous activity with the intent of increasing performance, muscle mass, or skill, physical activity simply needs to involve movement and physical work.
 While some individuals may choose to be physically active to maintain a healthy lifestyle and lower the risks of diseases (such as previously mentioned), others may decide to lose a certain amount of weight, or even decide to participate in a performance-based activity such as a 5k run or a 10k race.To lose weight, you’ll need to focus on cardiovascular exercise in combination with a reduced calorie diet, which will also help improve endurance-based physical activities.
Even if you have no specific endurance- or performance-based goals, you should still aim to be active for at least 30 minutes a day. Even if you spend this time walking or doing another form of low-exertion activity, it will improve your overall health., In addition to helping you lose weight and combat potential threats from disease, physical activity—especially activity done during leisure time which would otherwise be spent in sedentary activities—can both improve your mood and relieve stress.When you perform physical activities, your brain releases chemicals that induce happiness and feelings of relaxation.
Physical activity—and especially forms of exercise—cause nutrients and oxygen to rush to your muscle tissue, increasing your energy throughout the day.

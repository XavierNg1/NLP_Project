 Any container that holds water without leaking will work fine. You can choose to fill it all the way or part way with water.


Don’t use porcelain cups or hard bottles. Water expands as it freezes, so if you use a mug or Nalgene bottle to freeze water in, then it is possible that it will crack the container. A metal cup, ice cube tray, or a plastic disposable water bottle are all good options.
If you boil water before freezing it, the ice will come out crystal clear instead of cloudy.
There are several molds you can find online that will let you freeze ice into different shapes, such as a fish, skull, or even a shot glass.
 The freezer's temperature should be well below 32°F or 0°C.Find a flat spot in your freezer. Place the container on the surface carefully without spilling any water.
 It will take a while for the water to completely freeze. The bigger the container of water, the longer it may take. For example, water in an ice cube tray will freeze faster than an entire bottle full of water.
 Your water should be totally solid. Enjoy your cold ice with a refreshing drink.

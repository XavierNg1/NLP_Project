 When you purchase a computer for your parents, it might not be the first time they have ever used one. If this is the case, you should consider purchasing a computer with hardware, an operating system, and features similar to the computer they are used to working on. Retaining familiarity means they will be more comfortable with the new computer and there will be less of a learning curve.For example, if your parents are used to using Windows on a desktop computer, it might be a good idea to purchase a desktop that operates using Windows.
 Laptops can be a good choice for computer users who want portability in a computer model. Their screen sizes generally range from around 11 inches to 15 inches, which is much smaller than the screen size of most desktops. They also offer less choice in internal components, and can be more difficult to upgrade and repair. For most users, however, these drawbacks are made up in the laptop’s size, portability, and accessibility., A tablet with a keyboard can be a great computer choice for your parents. An iPad, for example, takes minimal time to boot or load apps, is nearly impervious to viruses, and has an operating system that is easy to learn and use. A tablet travels well and will give your parents flexibility in their daily use. It is also an extremely budget-friendly option., If portability isn’t a priority for your parents, you should consider a desktop computer. A desktop setup can be more comfortable and will allow you multiple options including more memory and processing power for your money. Monitors on desktops are also larger, usually starting at 17 inches, which can be an important factor to consider if your parents struggle with eyesight issues.

 Do not waste time collecting items or calling the fire department when you are in danger. Call the fire department from outside (a cellular phone or a neighborâ€™s phone) once you are safely away from danger. Stay upwind and away from the residence to avoid breathing toxic fumes.
 Call emergency medical services.
 The first aid advice found on containers may be out of date or inappropriate. Do not give anything by mouth unless advised to do so by a medical professional.
 Some chemicals may not wash out completely.

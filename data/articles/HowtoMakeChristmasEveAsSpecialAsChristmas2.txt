 Christmas Eve traditions can create a sense of community and comfort in your family.If you feel like your Christmas Eve is lackluster, start some new traditions to give your family something to look forward to. For example:


Let your children choose a present to open before they go to bed.
Collect special ornaments that can only be hung on Christmas Eve.
Let your children loot their stockings before Christmas eve.
 Google has created an app called “Santa Tracker” that allows you to follow Santa’s adventures online or on your phone. He “stops” all over the world to give presents to children, teaching you a little bit about each place. On Christmas Eve, gather your children up and watch Santa’s progress together for a magical holiday experience.You can download this app from the Google Play store or use the browser version online.
 Bundle up your family in warm clothing before leaving your house. Next, collect some flashlights to help you see your way. Walk up and down your block, knocking on the doors and calling, “Christmas carols!” When your neighbor opens the door, begin singing carols for them.Gather a few families together to create a fun group caroling event.
Go caroling after dinner to avoid interrupting your neighbor’s meals.
 Make a batch of reindeer dust in advance from a mix of oatmeal, cereal, rice, and dried fruits. Separate the reindeer dust into several small plastic bags and write each child’s name on them. Next, lead your children into the yard and let them sprinkle the reindeer dust into the grass. This will draw the reindeer (and Santa!) to your home.Many people avoid throwing uncooked rice on their lawn, believing that it’s unsafe for birds to eat. However, this is a myth.

 If a person took the time to meet with you or write you a referral, it is important that you thank them for the time that they took out of their busy schedule. Everyone has a lot of stuff going on in their lives, and the fact that this person set aside time to talk with you is something that deserves thanks.


Similarly, thank them for putting in the effort to either think about your situation so that they could give you advice, or writing you a referral.
 In the meat of the letter, mention the advice that the person gave you, and how you hope to apply that advice to your situation.


Highlight the most valuable thing you learned from your discussion if you wish to do so.
 If their advice applied to a certain situation that you have since remedied, mention this in the letter and outline how their advice helped you to overcome the situation.


You could be vague about the situation, or you could go into detail about how you used their advice. This will depend on the relationship you have with the person.
 If you plan to send a gift along with your letter, make sure to explain it in the letter.


For instance, if the person you met with mentioned a magazine article they had been hoping to read, send along your copy of the magazine with a note about how you hope that they find the article interesting.
However, this is optional and depends on the conversation you had. You do not need to send gifts along with every thank you letter that you write.
 Lastly, mention once again how grateful you are that they took the time to give you advice or write you a referral. Mention again that it meant a lot to you.
 Once you have drafted your thank you letter, proofread it for any errors. Make sure that there are no awkward sentences, or that you have used incorrect grammar.


Ask someone else to proofread your letter if you are concerned about its contents.

 Don't try to 'heroically' rescue someone or venture indoors. Your best bet is to stay outside, where the risk of collapsing structures is diminished. The greatest danger exists directly outside buildings, at exits, and alongside exterior walls.
 These are the main risks of being outdoors when an earthquake or one of its aftershocks is in progress.
 Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires. Proceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped. Avoid roads, bridges, or ramps that might have been damaged by the earthquake., Although it may seem counterintuitive, waiting for help is probably your best bet if you find yourself trapped under immovable debris.


Do not light a match or a lighter. Leaking gas or other flammable chemicals may accidentally light on fire.
Do not move about or kick up dust. Cover your mouth with a handkerchief or piece of clothing.
Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can locate you. Use a whistle if one is available. Shout only as a last resort. Shouting can cause you to inhale dangerous amounts of dust.
 A tsunami happens when an earthquake causes an extreme underwater disturbance, sending powerful waves towards shores and human habitation. If there's just been an earthquake and its epicenter is in the ocean, there's a good chance you'll have to be on the lookout for tsunamis.

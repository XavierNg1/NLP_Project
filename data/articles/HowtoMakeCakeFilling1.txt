 Firstly, gather your ingredients. You will need:


1/2 cup of white vegetable shortening, softened
1 cup of butter, softened
1 tsp of vanilla extract
2 - 4 cups of powdered sugar (if you like it sweet, use 4 cups, and if you prefer it less sweet, use less sugar)
~ 2 tbsp milk;
, Then, add in vanilla and beat well to combine.
 When you finish incorporating all of the sugar, you should use a spatula to give the buttercream a stir.
 Add as much or as little milk until the desired consistency is reached. Also, if you want your frosting to be a certain color or flavor, you should put it in now.
 It may be best to cover the bowl with a damp cloth.

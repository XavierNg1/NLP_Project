 Decide what makeup you need. Have acne? Consider wearing a primer and foundation. Dark circles under your eyes? Concealer is the answer. Want your eyes to pop? Eyeliner and mascara is for you.;
, Good stores to buy makeup are MAC and Sephora. If you want something cheap, check out your local drugstore (Rite Aid, Walmart, etc.)

, Cleaning your face, applying toner, using moisturizer, and a good primer are the most important things you can do, as this will improve your skin without makeup, and minimize what you need to wear to have flawless skin. (They all should be appropriate to your skin tone, of course).
 If your eyeshadow results in a lot of fallout (or dropped eyeshadow under your eyes), it's easiest to do your eyes before your face and lips, as you can just wipe away fallout with a makeup remover wipe. If you will not be wearing eyeshadow, or if your eyeshadow doesn't result in much fallout, you can get away with doing your face makeup first.
 While your face makeup will likely always be the same (primer, foundation, concealer), your eye makeup will likely change from day to day, so decide if you want to focus on your eyes or lips, and then apply your eyeshadow accordingly. If you're playing up your eyes, experiment with fun colors or new techniques, like a cat eye liner shape, or a smokey eye., If you're focusing on them, try a bold color like bright red or a deep color like wine or berry. If you'd like a light makeup look, you could use tinted or untainted balm, or a light gloss. If you want to wear a little more makeup and have some more upkeep, exfoliate your lips either with a wet rag or a lip exfoliator, then apply a balm or primer. After letting this soak in, wipe off any leftover product, and apply your lip liner, either clear, a color matching your natural lip, or an exact match to your lipstick or stain. Then apply your desired lip color, and rock it!

 Buy her a pizza and write something clever, like “I know it’s cheesy, but will you be my valentine?” in the lid. Get her a small stuffed animal, and hang a sign on the animal’s neck with the question “Will you be my valentine?” Send her a box of chocolates or candy hearts with the question on the lid., Make her a homemade valentine’s card. Cut it out of red or pink construction paper. Use your best handwriting to tell her you’d like her to be your valentine. You could also buy a valentine.


Choose a card that reflects your relationship. Pick something romantic if you’re already going out with her or something more laid back if you’re friends.
 Send her flowers or give them to her in person. Attach a little note to the flowers that asks her to be your valentine. Use the card even if you give them to her in person., Surprise her with homemade goodies. Make sure you follow the recipe, especially if you don’t bake regularly. Ask her to be your valentine when you give her the treat.


Joke about it if your creation doesn’t end up tasting great. For example, you can say that you did your best to bring her something sweet, even if it can’t measure up to how great and sweet she is.
 Buy some chocolate kisses. Try to get them in Valentine’s Day pink and red if you can. Glue them to the ground where you know she will be, like her front step or in front of her locker at school. Write her a note saying, “Now that I have kissed the ground that you walk on, will you be my valentine?”You can also glue them to the ground in a line along a path that she commonly walks.

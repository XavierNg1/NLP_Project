 This is where you can see a list of all your apps.


Don't confuse your Apps list with your Home screen. Deleting an app icon from your Home screen will not uninstall the app from your device.
 Browse your Apps list and look for the Bitmoji icon. It looks like a green speech bubble with a winking face in it.
 This will activate the editing mode on your Apps list.
 It looks like a trash bin icon at the top of your screen. You will have to confirm your action in a pop-up window.


Depending on your device and software, the Uninstall tab may be located at a different place on your screen. If you don't see this option when you tap and hold the app icon, you might want to try uninstalling the app from the App Manager on your Settings menu.
 This will uninstall the Bitmoji app from your device.

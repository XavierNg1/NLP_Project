 Get the person’s name and their mailing address. You should mail the letter directly to the person instead of giving it to your tenant.;
, Does the tenant only need a letter stating the dates they rented from you? Or do they need more information? Clarify ahead of time what your tenant needs so that you are sure to include all of the information.


For example, your tenant might need a landlord reference letter, which is different from a proof of residence. With a reference letter, you give your opinion about whether you would rent to the tenant again.Avoid providing information that isn’t requested. For example, don’t include information about the rent in your letter unless your tenant asks you to.
 Some property management companies protect themselves by having tenants sign a release. In the release, the tenant identifies what information they want released and agree not to sue you for releasing it.


Find a release used for employment references and adjust it to fit your circumstances.

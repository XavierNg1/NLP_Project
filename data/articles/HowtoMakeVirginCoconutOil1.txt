 Use a mature, brown coconut, rather than a young green one.;
, Use a coconut scraper, sharp pairing knife or a sturdy metal spoon. *Removing the meat is tricky. A butter knife is much better than a sharp pairing knife. You can slide it in between the meat and the shell and 'pop' pieces off, rather than slip, and cut your hand.Â 

,,, Add a little water to help it blend if necessary.
 Put a coffee filter or cheesecloth over a wide-mouth jar. Pour or spoon a small amount of the coconut mixture onto the cloth. Wrap the cloth around the coconut mixture and squeeze the milk into the jar.


Squeeze hard, to make sure you get every last drop.
Repeat this process until all of the coconut mixture has been used.
 As it sets, the coconut milk and oil will separate and a layer of curd will appear at the top of the jar.


Refrigerate the jar so the curd hardens more quickly if you'd like.
If you'd prefer not to refrigerate it, leave the jar in a cool room.
 The pure virgin coconut oil is left in the jar.

 Parties are not as big of a deal as they’re cracked up to be. A few hours before the party, go for a jog, do some yoga, or find a quiet space to meditate. Any of these will help you to shake off some stress. When you begin to relax, your thoughts will flow more naturally and you will be able to be yourself without your anxious thoughts holding you back.
 Choose a friend you can rely on and stick with for the night. Friends can keep you calm by pulling you out of awkward conversations or jumping into them. They will also make it less uncomfortable if you decide to step back for a while and not talk to anyone else.
 If you feel yourself getting flustered at the party, excuse yourself for a second. Go to the bathroom or step outside into the fresh air and gather your thoughts. Remind yourself that there’s nothing to feel uncomfortable about, it’s just a party.
 Introverts sometimes use alcohol as “liquid courage.” However, getting drunk hides the real you. Worse, you could end up doing something you’ll regret the next day. When you stay sober, you maintain your self-control and actually reduce the risk of social awkwardness.If you don’t drink alcohol, you don’t have to feel left out. You could opt for punch or a soft drink. Ginger ale, if available, can mimic the appearance of white wine or beer. If opaque cups are available, you could drink water from yours. No one has to know your drink is alcohol-free.

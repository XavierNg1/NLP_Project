 Casting an absentee ballot through an online web portal is probably what most people would think of when they think of online voting. Unfortunately, it is also the least available of all types of online ballot access.Currently, only Alaska, Missouri, Arizona, and North Dakota offer access in this way. Alabama tried a pilot program for the 2016 primary election, and has not decided yet whether to implement it on a permanent basis.
Only Alaska offers this option to all voters. In the other states, only military and overseas voters are eligible, as provided by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voter Act (UOCAVA), although additional restrictions may apply based on your own state’s laws.
 If you are eligible, you will need to request the ballot. The exact procedures differ by state, so you will need to check with your state’s Secretary of State’s office.


You can find a listing of links to those offices at http://www.canivote.org/. No matter what, you will need to begin the process by requesting the ballot. In states like Arizona, you might be able to complete the process in one sitting. In other states like Alaska, you might need to request the ballot first, then wait for the state to email you the actual ballot.
 Once you’ve received the ballot, you can login to the web portal and vote. In some states, all you will do is enter a user ID and a password and cast the ballot. In other states, you might save a PDF of the ballot, print out a verification form, scan the completed form, and send them both back to the state via email, fax, or postal mail.

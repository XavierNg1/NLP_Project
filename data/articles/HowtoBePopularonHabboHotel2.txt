 The popular Habbos didn't become popular by sitting quietly in the corner. They went to Public Rooms, chatted about stuff, became friends and kept them. Go to the welcome rooms, look at some "cool" people and try to dress like them.
 That way, you can ask for advice, copy them (don't let them find out) and hang out with them.
, They will *hopefully* respect you back. Maybe act a little bit like other cool habbos. The way they talk, act, move or react. Don't get the wrong idea and follow all the popular people. Just if your friends with one, hang with them!

, Ask them to move some furniture into your room, so they can share houses.

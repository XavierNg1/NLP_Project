 Congestion can shift to one part of the nasal passage when you lie down on your side, worsening the stuffiness.Prop your head up with a couple of pillows if you're lying down, and try to sleep on your back, if possible.
 Stay hydrated to help thin the mucus in your nose.Drink lots of water, juice, sports drinks, or tea throughout the day – at least 8 glasses daily.









A good stuffy nose reliever is hot water, lemon, and honey – and drinking warm beverages can also help soothe a sore throat accompanying your stuffy nose.
 Certain people may experience more congestion when they drink milk. Although it’s not a must and there is no evidence to support the belief that milk causes congestion, you can try avoiding milk, cheese, and other dairy products while you have a stuffy nose.
 Often, stuffy noses are caused by seasonal allergies or allergic reactions to pet dander, dust, and mold. If you don’t want to take allergy medication all the time, try to keep your home and car as clean as possible. Vacuum regularly and change your bedding several times per week – especially your pillow cases.

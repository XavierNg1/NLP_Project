 Start by braiding your hair in an area of your choice. The side of your head may be the easiest area to start with. Make the braid thick if you are using wide beads and use a thin braid if you are using narrow beads., Leave the end of the braid loose. Then, twist the end with your hand so it forms a narrow strand of hair., Use your mouth to wet the twisted end of hair. You can also run the end under running water or use a spray bottle of water to wet it.Wetting the end will make it easier to thread through the bead.
 Take the bead and carefully thread it through the wet, twisted end of hair. Try to get all of your hair into the opening of the bead., Slide the bead up the braid to where youâ€™d like it to sit. Then, tie a clear hair elastic onto your hair. Pull the bead over the hair elastic so it stays in place.

You can then braid the rest of your hair or add more beads as you see fit.

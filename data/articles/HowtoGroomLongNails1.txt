 Long nails can harbor dangerous infections, making meticulous hand-washing a must.Centers of Disease Control and Protection recommend a particular way to wash your hands that is the most effective at killing germs and microbes.Use clean, running water. Apply soap and lather for 20 seconds, making sure to scrub the backsides of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails. Rinse your hands well and dry them on a clean towel.Keeping nails dry is as important as keeping them clean, since moisture can encourage bacteria to grow. Carefully dry your hands on a clean towel every time you get them wet.Carry antibacterial hand sanitizer with you for times when soap and water aren’t available. Make sure the sanitizer is a gel and contains at least 60% alcohol – most commercially available sanitizers meet this criteria.Using a hand sanitizer is not as effective as washing your hands with soap and water, but it will do in a pinch. Don't replace regular hand washing with sanitizer.;
, Nail brushes are available for use during nail care, but you can also try using an old toothbrush to clean underneath your nails with soap and water.After washing, use an orange stick to clean beneath the nail. For stubborn debris, soak a Q-tip or small piece of cotton with nail polish remover (preferably an acetone-free version) and wrap it around the end of the orange stick before swabbing beneath the nail., Not only does it damage the nail bed, but even a minor cut or abrasion can harbor bacteria and fungi.Carefully clip off any hangnails with nail clippers.


Also avoid trimming your cuticles. Instead, use an orange stick to push them back.There are also cuticle-removing products available on the market, which are safe to use for this purpose.
 Use a cotton ball soaked with alcohol to thoroughly wipe off all of your nail tools before and after every use to avoid spreading infection. Make sure all of your tools are sharp and functioning along with being clean.

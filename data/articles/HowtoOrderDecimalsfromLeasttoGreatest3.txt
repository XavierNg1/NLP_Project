 A decimal symbol looks like a dot or period. (In Europe, the decimal symbol looks like a comma.) It separates the number into its whole and fractional parts.The digits to the left of a decimal symbol represent whole numbers. The digits to the right of the decimal symbol represent fractional numbers.

For example, if you have the decimal 12.38, the digits 1 and 2 represent whole numbers (the number 12), and the digits 3 and 8 represent fractional numbers (.38 is less than 1, or a fraction of 1).
 Place value indicates the value of a digit. A digit can have a different value, depending on where it is located in a number.From right to left, the place values are ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten-thousands, hundred-thousands, and millions.For example, In the number 51, the digit 5 is in the tens place. It has a value of 5 tens, or 50. But in the number 50,001, the digit 5 is in the ten-thousands place. It has a value of 5 ten-thousands, or 50,000. 

The smallest place value for whole numbers is the ones place. Once you have 10 ones, you exchange them for 1 ten. Thus, you have a 1 in the tens place, and a 0 in the ones place. Once you have 10 tens, you exchange them for 1 hundred. Thus, you have a 1 in the hundreds place, and a 0 in the tens and ones place. In other words, each new place value you add on increases by a factor of 10.This pattern continues for the higher place values. 

Note that place value gets larger from right-to-left. In a whole number, a digit has more value the farther away it is from the decimal point.
 Just like place value indicates the value of digit in a whole number, it also indicates the value of a digit in a fractional number. From left-to-right from the decimal symbol, the place values are tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten-thousandths, hundred-thousandths, and millionths.For example, in the number 1.5, the digit 5 is in the tenths place. It has the value of 5 tenths, or 510{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{10}}}. But in the number 1.0005, the digit 5 has a value of 5 ten-thousandths, or 510,000{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{10,000}}}.

The largest place value for fractional numbers is the tenths place. You need 10 hundredths to make 1 tenth. You need 10 thousandths to make 1 hundredth. In other words, each new place value you add on decreases by a factor of 10.This pattern continues for the smaller place values.

Note that, similar to place value in whole numbers, place value in fractional numbers gets bigger moving from right-to-left. However, in a fractional number, a digit has less value the farther away it is from the decimal point. It is a common misconception that 1 tenth is less than 1 hundredth, since 1 ten is less than 1 hundred. However, 1 tenth is greater than 1 hundredth. When comparing fractional place value, it can help to think of the digits expressed as fractions:110>1100{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{10}}>{\frac {1}{100}}}.

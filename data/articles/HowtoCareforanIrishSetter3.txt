 Irish Setters have beautiful coats that need regular maintenance. Brush your dog’s fur at least two to three times a week in order to prevent matting, and give it a bath monthly.Start at your dog’s head and work your way down its body. Be careful around sensitive areas, like its belly.
Use a finer comb if you come across tangles or mats. Comb them out thoroughly, but give your dog breaks as needed. Give it a treat or some play time if it gets overwhelmed or uncomfortable.
Consulting a professional groomer or trimming your dog’s fur regularly is optional, and will help keep it looking its best.
 Irish Setters’ nails grow fast, so trimming them regularly using clippers or a grinder will help prevent overgrowth and breaking.Brush your dog’s teeth three times a week, using gauze wrapped around your finger and either toothpaste for dogs or just water. Check its ears weekly for wax and debris buildup, and clean them out using a cotton ball or gauze wrapped around your finger.Choose times when your dog is calm and relaxed to brush teeth and trim nails. Try to develop a routine so it gets used to hygiene care.
Don’t use regular toothpaste when brushing your dog’s teeth, and don’t use water to clean its ears. Never place anything (e.g. a cotton swab) in your dog’s ear canal.
 Flea and tick prevention is particularly important for Irish Setters due to their coats. Check your dog’s skin and coat for ticks, fleas, and other pests after each walk. Be especially thorough if you live in a wooded area.Ask your vet to recommend or prescribe a flea and tick preventative. Use this and other pet medications as directed by your vet.

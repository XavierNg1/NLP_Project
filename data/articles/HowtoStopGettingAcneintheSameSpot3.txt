 If you get acne on your chest, back, or butt, consider wearing clothes that allow your skin to breathe. Tight-fitting clothes can trap moisture and irritate your skin, leading to breakouts. Instead, wear clothes made from natural fibers, such as cotton or silk, which allow airflow and wick away moisture.This is particularly important when it comes to clothes that you sweat in a lot, such as your exercise gear.
If you get acne on your back from wearing a backpack, consider using a handbag or satchel instead.
 Once you finish working out, you should always take off your sweaty exercise clothes and take a shower. This allows your skin to breathe and washes away the oil and sweat that can cause breakouts. If your gym does not have a locker room with showers, make sure that you shower right away when you get home.If you cannot shower immediately, consider using travel wipes that contain salicylic acid.
 Because it leaves pores and follicles susceptible to bacteria, removing body hair, by either shaving or waxing, can lead to breakouts. Instead, you might want to consider laser hair removal, which is less irritating to the skin. If you do have to shave, make sure that you use a shaving cream designed for sensitive skin.This is particularly important if you get acne around your bikini line.
You can also try gentler alternatives, like sugaring and threading.
 Because bacteria can hang out on your clothes and bedding, you should regularly wash all fabrics that come in contact with your skin. Bacteria on pillows can cause your face to break out and unwashed clothes can lead to body acne. Make sure you wash your clothes regularly and your bedding at least every two weeks.If you wear any hats, be sure to wash them regularly to prevent any breakouts on your forehead.

 It’s a major bummer when you use one of these techniques to create beautiful winged eyeliner, only to examine them in the mirror and notice a small flaw. If you don’t want to remove your eyeliner and start over, you can use foundation instead. Using a clean eyeliner brush, crisp up the borders of your winged liner. With this technique, you can conceal any jagged edges or overly thick lines., This step can be tricky for beginners, but done correctly and it can improve your winged eyeliner game immensely. Imagine that you’ve created wings on both sides of your eyes only to discover that one line is a bit thicker than the other, or extends a bit too far out from the eye. Dip a small Q-tip into makeup remover, and carefully erase any extra eyeliner. Once you’ve removed a bit of liner, check again to see if your wings are even.








You can do a quick stroke along the side of your wing to thin out the line, or you can carefully shorten your wing as well.
Once you’ve removed the “wonky” parts of the wing, you may need to grab your eyeliner and perfect it a bit more.
 This is a perfect tip for anyone in a hurry, with no time to sit in front of the mirror drawing and redrawing their winged eyeliner. If you’ve drawn your wings and they’re a bit uneven or shaky, grab an eyeliner brush and smudge them out a bit. Instead of adding more product, you can drag the product you’ve already placed, adjusting the sides to make them even or smoothing jagged skinny lines into thicker wings. You may not get the super skinny wings you were originally going for, but at least they’ll be even!Ariana Grande rocks the thick eyeliner wings, so you can always say that’s what you were going for as well.

 Juice fasts cleanse the body by eliminating food that's hard to digest or toxic and providing the body with nutrients exclusively from fresh-squeezed fruits and vegetables. A juice fast can last anywhere from 2 days to over 2 months, and many report that it leaves the body feeling refreshed and energized.


To complete a juice fast, make your own juice with a juicer. Juicers quickly squeeze the juice (and nutrients) from fruits, vegetables and herbs. Without this machine, juice fasting would require hours of prep work.
Buy spinach, kale, apples, pears, lemons, carrots, ginger, and other watery fruits and vegetables to juice.
Make enough juice in the morning to last you all day long. You should plan on having 6 to 8 glasses of juice per day to keep your hunger at bay.
 Taking a break from eating food for half a day or up to 36 hours helps detoxify your body by creating the right conditions for autophagy, in which cells get rid of damaged molecules, to occur.Intermittent fasting boosts energy in the short-term and may help prevent obesity and neurological diseases.Start by skipping lunch and dinner on a day when you don't have plans that require you to expend a lot of energy. Go to bed hungry and break your fast in the morning with a glass of water and a light breakfast.
Work up to fasting for longer periods of time. As your body grows more used to fasting, your hunger pangs and cravings won't be as strong.

 This method turns a lavender-infused oil into a salve that can be rubbed onto your skin to lessen inflammation and pain.First, you'll need to create the lavender-infused oil as described in another section, or purchase some from a herbalist store.
 You may wish to use a cheap, extra grater rather than one you use regularly, because the wax may be difficult to clean off. Measure the beeswax before you shave it into fragments; you will need approximately 1 part beeswax to 8 parts oil. Use more beeswax for a harder balm, and less for a softer salve.If your beeswax was sold by weight, you can use these approximate weight to volume conversions: 1 ounce of beeswax = 1 fluid ounce = 1/8 cup = 28 grams., Place the beeswax fragments in a pan. Pour the lavender-infused oil over it. Heat over low heat until they have melted together. It may take 15 minutes or more for all the beeswax fragments to melt. Stir occasionally using a wooden spoon or other heat-safe utensil, preferably one you don't mind damaging if wax ends up stuck to it permanently.
 Pour the melted balm into glass or tin containers, making sure they are clean and dry first. Seal with an airtight lid.
 After 10 or 15 minutes in the refrigerator, or 30 minutes in a cool room or cellar, check on the balm or salve to see how hard it is. If it is still liquid, or too hard to scoop up with your fingers, you may need to melt it again. Add more beeswax to make it harder, or more oil to make it softer.
 Boil hot, soapy water in your pot once it's been emptied of balm, then turn off the heat. Let it cool for a couple minutes, then put on rubber gloves so you can scrub the wax from the sides while the water is still quite hot. Place the stirring utensil in the water only after the water is done boiling to avoid damaging it. Scrub the utensil and pot with a hard sponge or scrubbing brush.

 A trip to the store for the extra ingredients is worth the delicious texture of the result. You can follow the same steps as the easy recipe: just blend until smooth, pour into popsicle molds, and freeze. Unlike the easy version, you'll end up with a creamy, fudge-like texture, with no hard ice crystals.¾ cup (180 mL) Nutella
½ cup (120 mL) sweetened condensed milk
½ cup (120 mL) heavy cream
1 cup (240 mL) whole milk
½ tsp (2.5 mL) vanilla extract
pinch of salt

, You think this is just a convenient summer treat? What if your popsicles were the centerpiece of a dessert table? Try out this maelstrom of flavor:Mash or puree 4 large, ripe bananas or 6 medium bananas.
Blend or mix in ½ cup (120 mL) Nutella until smooth and pour into molds. Alternatively, spoon the two ingredients in alternate layers to get a striped popsicle.
Pop the molds in the freezer. While you wait, toast pistachios for 6–8 minutes in a dry pan or in the oven.Freeze nuts until cold, then grind to a powder in a food processor.Roll popsicles in the powder before serving.
 Cream liqueur keeps the smooth dairy texture, while adding a buzz of its own. Bailey's is the most commonly available option, but you can use other Irish cream liqueur brand, or even make your own. Combine these ingredients and freeze in popsicle molds:½ cup (120 mL) Irish cream liqueur
½ cup (120 mL) milk
⅓ cup (80 mL) Nutella

Note— You can increase the amount of liqueur, but the popsicles will take longer to freeze. If you go above 10% alcohol (1⅕ cup / 285 mL of Bailey's), you'll probably need chunks of banana to help it freeze.

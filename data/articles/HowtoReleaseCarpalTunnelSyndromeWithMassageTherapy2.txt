 Hold your arm straight out in front of you, palm up, and bend your hand down so that your fingers point to the floor.Optionally, you can do this kneeling on the floor by placing the palms of your hands on the floor (fingers pointing toward you). Shift your body backward until you feel the stretch.Hold the stretch for at least 30 seconds.
Repeat with the other hand.
 This is almost identical to the previous stretch except you will extend your arm with your palm downward this time. Bend your hand down so that your fingers point to the floor.Hold the stretch for at least 30 seconds.
Repeat with the other hand.
 This is a series of movements during which your fingers reach five positions: straight, hook, fist, tabletop, and straight fist.Start with the straight position by holding your fingers straight up and together.
Bend your fingertips down to lightly touch the palm (if you can).
Move your fingers to a partially closed fist.
Bend your fingers straight forward with your thumb underneath (like forming a birds head).
Finally, form a fully closed fist with your thumb relaxed on the side.
Repeat this series of movements a few times with both hands.

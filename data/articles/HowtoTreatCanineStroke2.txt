 Symptoms and signs of canine stroke will vary from those noted in humans. People suffering from a stroke may have signs of total paralysis on one side of the body that is affected or seen with a drooping face.In dogs, rather than the drooping face, you may notice a tilting or turning head, imbalance that leads to falling or circling, an inability to walk or keep his balance and often times, a loss of vision.
Your veterinarian will perform some specific tests to determine if the symptoms indeed signify a stroke.
 Your veterinarian will first determine your dog's condition by the signs you have related to him or her, along with physically watching your pet's behavior and walk. Tests for a definitive diagnosis involve such tests as an MRI, CT scan and standard X-rays in order to see specific images within the brain.


Your dog may need to be anaesthetized for these and other tests such as a spinal tap that takes a sample of spinal fluid in an effort to check for other issues, concerns and diseases with similar symptoms.
The doctor will be looking for any type of tumor on the brain, bleeding and its source or inflammation and infection.
 Canine strokes occur when the blood supply to the dog's brain is blocked or lessened so that proper function is inhibited. If a blood vessel bursts within the brain, it leads to a hemorrhagic stroke, while an Ischemic stroke is due to a reduced blood supply to the brain.The brain cannot function properly without a constant healthy supply of blood that provides necessary nutrients and ample oxygen throughout the body. When proper blood supply and circulation is compromised, altered bodily function can be evident.

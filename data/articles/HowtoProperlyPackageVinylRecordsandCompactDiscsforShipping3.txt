 With 78’s, the same care, if not more, should be given as in packing LP’s. 10-inch 78 rpm records are made of shellac, which is more brittle than vinyl. In addition, unlike LP’s, most 78’s were not issued with cardboard outer jackets, but only paper sleeves. Therefore, when packing a 78 rpm record, one should follow the steps above in packing an LP, with these exceptions:


The mailer box will be smaller. The length and width of the mailer should both be between 10 ¼ to 10 ½ inches.
 Each disc should be individually separated by a cardboard insert. In my opinion, further cushioning with bubble wrap can only help to prevent against damage.
 Again, a well cushioned and snug fit is of utmost importance!

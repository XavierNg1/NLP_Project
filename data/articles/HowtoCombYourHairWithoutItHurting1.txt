 Never use a brush on wet hair. By using a wide-tooth comb or pick with rounded tips, you’ll be able to comb out your hair much more gently than if you used a fine-tooth comb or a brush. You’ll be able to work any tangles out softly and painlessly. When your hair is wet, it’s much more fragile and vulnerable to damage, so be very gentle., This will help work out any nasty tangles or knots you have, and make the combing process easier. An easier combing process means less pulling at your scalp, and thus less pain. Many products will give you additional benefits, like taming frizz and softening your hair. Find a product that works best for your hair type, and you’ll reduce the pain of combing., In other words, comb a little bit at the tips, moving upwards only when you’ve gotten out any tangles in the previous section.Most people’s natural inclination is to start at the root and just try to comb their way to the bottom. You’ll run into a lot of tangles this way, and risk breaking and tearing your hair. Start from the bottom, and slowly work your way up.

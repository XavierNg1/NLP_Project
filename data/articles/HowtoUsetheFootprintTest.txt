, Can you see the entire silhouette of your foot, or is it more of an outline, with just heels and toes showing?

, There will be a noticeable curve inward, but not by more than 3/4 of an inch at its greatest part. If this is the kind of silhouette your foot makes, then you have normal feet. Otherwise.
 Your footprint will look like a foot-shaped blob. There will be almost no inward curve from your big toe to your heel; there may even be an outward curve. This means that you've got flat feet. If your footprint looks like neither, then.
 Your toe and heel show, but there is little in between. If this is the case, you probably have a high arch foot.


Normal Feet - Stability shoes offer a good blend of cushioning, medial support (to limit excessive inward rolling of the foot, which can cause injury) and durability. To provide stability, they have features that provide a firmer density under the inner edge of your foot. They are usually built on a semi-curved last.
Flat Feet - Motion control shoes are the most rigid, control-oriented running shoes. They're designed to slow down or limit extreme inward rolling of the foot and ankle, which can cause injury. These are heavier but very durable.
High Arched Feet - Cushioned shoes generally have the softest mid-soles and the least added stability. Theyâ€™re usually built semi-curved or curved to encourage foot motion, which is helpful for runners who have rigid, immobile feet.

 Before serving your mimosas, make sure the liquids you're using are cold. Keep your juice and carbonated beverage refrigerated before using it for a mimosa., You should not mix mimosas in large pitchers. It's best to serve your mimosas by pouring the drinks one by one., A light garnish can make a mimosa look attractive and add a splash of flavor. For example, garnish your drinks with fresh mint or a slice of apple, orange, or grapefruit., Continue to top off your mimosas with another splash of your carbonated beverage followed by your juice. You can add ice to keep the drinks cool as well, but keep in mind this may dull the flavor.

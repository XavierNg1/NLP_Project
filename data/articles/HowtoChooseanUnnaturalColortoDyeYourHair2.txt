 You probably had to learn about the color wheel in elementary school. Google a copy of the color wheel to figure out how the wheel can affect your chosen hair color.Complimentary colors fall on opposite ends of the color wheel. If you dye your hair a complimentary color, you may end up with a totally different color than you expected. For example, say you have golden blonde hair. If you try to dye your hair blue, a color found on the opposite side of the color wheel, these colors will combine. You could end up with green hair.
Instead, pick a color that would compliment your hair. If you have undertones you want gone, you'll have to pick a color to neutralize these tones. For example, if you have red undertones, they can be neutralized with an ashy, greenish shade.
 Blonde hair is tricky to dye. It often has a variety of undertones that can affect how a dye will take. Blondes are at a greater risk of ending up with greenish hair during the dyeing process. A professional stylist, who knows how to work the color wheel to bring out the best shade, should be consulted prior to dyeing your hair., Darker hair is also more difficult to dye. Often, you will need to bleach or lighten the hair prior to the dyeing process. This can be tricky to do alone, especially if you don't have any professional training. See a stylist if your hair is naturally dark. He or she can figure out how to lighten your hair appropriately to get the right shade for you., With gray hair, any color you choose will come out very bright. A dark blue dye, for example, can come out bright blue.Therefore, you may want to select a color that's slightly darker than you want prior to dyeing your hair.

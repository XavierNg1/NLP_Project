 In this game, you touch each toe as you say a line about a different little pig. Younger babies will enjoy the sound of the rhyming and the touching of the toes.
Older children, as they begin to understand words and animals, will be able to relate to the words of the rhyme.
This can help you introduce some vocabulary words and body parts to a toddler or older baby (12-15 months).
 Say the first line of the rhyme. It is "This little piggy went to market".
Wiggle her big toe as you say the line.
Laugh and smile after say the line, this might get a reaction from your baby.
 These are as follows: "This little piggy stayed home".
"This little piggy had roast beef."
"This little piggy had none."
As you say each line progress to the next toe and wiggle it.
As you wiggle the toes, this might tickle the baby a little and cause him to laugh.
 You should land on the pinky toe as you say this line.


The last line of the poem is "And this little piggy went wee, wee, wee, wee all the way home!"
As you say the last line wiggle your baby's pinky toe.
Then tickle all the way up to his tummy.

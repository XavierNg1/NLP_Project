 To use it, you must recognize the color codes.;
, Blue means there are no Boos in the room you are in, yellow means there is at least one Boo in the room, and a flashing red means the Boo is right near you. The faster it beeps, the closer you are to the Boo.
 Sometimes Boos will outsmart the Boo Radar and put bombs and Boo replicas in the room. The Boo radar will pick these up through its sensors, and if you fall for these, just avoid them. If you get hit by the bomb, you will lose some HP. The Boo replicas are harmless though.
 You don't need to worry about flashing your light on it, just aim your vacuum at it and suck away!

, It is highly recommended that you save after every Boo.
 If you get all 50 Boos, you win a silver jewel!

 Stand facing one another about 2 feet (0.6 m) apart and gently hold hands.


You can also stand beside your partner shoulder-to-shoulder and do the basic steps in tandem - either while holding one another’s waists and extending your free arms or without touching.And you can integrate the steps into the original style by simply replacing them with the sliding step.
 The leader will step back on his/her right foot as the follower steps back on his/her left. While doing this, let go of your partner’s hand and extend your free arm.


The leader will release and extend his or her right arm, and the follower his or her left.
This creates an open area as both partners step back and come shoulder-to-shoulder.
You also can wrap your arm around your partner’s waist as you meet shoulder-to-shoulder and extend your free arm. Or you can combine the two.
 Each partner will now take the same foot and step back to neutral so they are face-to-face.


Bring your free arm toward your partner while doing this, and hold hands again.
Both partners should move their hips from side to side as they dance.
 Pause briefly when you are again face-to-face. Then step back on your other foot first (the leader’s left and the partner’s right) and repeat.


Continue switching from side to side.
The count will be 1 when you both step back, 2 when you place your opposite foot, 3 when your bring your other foot forward, 4 when you come back together, 5 when you move your other foot back, 6 when you place your opposite foot, 7 when you bring your foot forward, and 8 when you come back together.

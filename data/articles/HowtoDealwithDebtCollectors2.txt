 If you're unfamiliar with the debt, you may be a victim of identity theft. Your credit report will have additional information regarding when and where the account was opened.


Especially if the debt sounds unfamiliar, you can request a free credit report annually from annualcreditreport.com and scan for incorrect data.If you find an error, notify each of the three credit reporting bureaus, as well as the debt collector, that the debt is not yours and you will not be paying it., To be considered legitimate under the FDCPA, you must submit your dispute to the collection agency in writing.The FDCPA requires you to send this written notice within 30 days of receiving the debt collector's notice of the debt.If you have a legitimate dispute, the collector may voluntarily stop any collection activities against you. The debt collector may have been unaware that the debt wasn't collectible until you disputed it., Once you've written your letter and signed it, make copies for your records before mailing it.
 Mail your letter using certified mail, return receipt requested, so you have proof that your letter has been received by the collection agency., Keep all letters the debt collector sends to you, and don't delete any voice messages.


Write down the date and time of each phone call, whether you answered, and whether the debt collector left you a voice mail if you didn't answer.
If you talk to the debt collector on the phone, take notes or write down a summary of the conversation after the phone call is over, when the exchange is still fresh in your mind., Especially if you believe you do not owe the debt or if a debt collector is continuing to harass you in violation of the FDCPA, an attorney may best be able to protect your interests.

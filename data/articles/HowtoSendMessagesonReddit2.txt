 Visit reddit.com and log in to your account. Click the envelope symbol next to your username near the top right corner of the screen.


Alternatively, go straight to reddit.com/message/inbox while you are logged in.
 Once you're in your inbox, the tabs at the top of the screen change. Click the "send a private message" tab to go to the message writing screen. Fill out the "to," "subject," and "message" fields, and click send.


You can also go straight to reddit.com/message/compose.
 Once a conversation has started, you don't need to fill out the form again. Just go to your inbox (the envelope) to see your received messages. Click the grey "reply" link underneath a message to write a reply.
 Whenever you see a username (usually below a submission or comment that user wrote), you can click it to visit the user page. On that page, look for a small "send a private message" link near the top right corner, underneath the karma amounts.

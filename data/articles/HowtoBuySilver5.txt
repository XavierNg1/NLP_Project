 Physical silver, such as coins, bars, bullion, or rounds, have been and are being used both as currencies and in industrial manufacturing. This makes them more versatile that securities that trade silver commodities, although not necessarily more liquid. If you're planning on investing in silver, start off with the precious metal before venturing off into other, more complex forms of ownership.
 In a time of economic uncertainty and slow growth, silver is an excellent hedge. A hedge is a strategy that reduces your risk of losses when the market fluctuates, usually by investing in an offsetting position. Silver is a good hedge against currency depreciation and even inflation. That's because if the value of currency ever plummets, precious metals like silver and gold remain relatively stable, if not increase in value.
 Many buyers of silver and gold approach the investment angle exactly the wrong way around: They buy when they notice the price going up, and they dump when they notice the price going down. Don't be someone who violates the first principle of investing â€” buy low and sell high.


Try to think of things the other way around. Instead of buying when everyone else is fearful and the price of silver is high, buy when everyone else is complacent and the price of silver has dropped or is experiencing a trough.
Take a look at a historical graph of silver prices. Over the past 30 years, in normal economic times, the price of silver flatlines at about $5/ounce.If you can afford to wait until silver hits this low, use this as a benchmark and invest then. When economic times are uncertain and the price of silver goes up, unload your silver for a hefty profit or keep it as a hedge against currency depreciation.
 Of course, if you happen to buy silver when it's bottomed out, then most of the volatility will be good volatility. But even then, expect tortuous price fluctuations and dips and turns as consumer sentiment and monetary policy changes.

 Go through your home and write a list of items that you never use, but that someone else might get a lot of enjoyment out of (e.g. a waffle maker, if you never eat waffles). Ask yourself whether or not you see yourself using the items in the next 3-6 months. If the answer is no, get rid of them by:


giving the items to friends or family who might want them
posting the items for sale online
having a garage sale
bringing the items to a thrift store
donating the items to a local charity

, Unorganized paperwork can create a lot of clutter and make it difficult to find important documents when you need them. Do an initial clean up to sort loose papers into categories (e.g. tax papers, warranties and user manuals, bank statements, etc.) Invest in a small filing cabinet or file folders to keep important documents in, and be sure to recycle unnecessary documents (junk mail, store circulars, etc.) as soon as they are no longer relevant to you. To minimize your paperwork, sign up for online billing with your bank and utility providers., Go through your closet, wardrobe, or dresser and remove everything that no longer fits, is in poor condition, or that you havenâ€™t worn in several months. Sort through clothing, shoes, boots, outerwear, and accessories, and pack up all wearable, extraneous items for a local charity. Throw out worn or damaged items, or put them aside to repurpose (e.g. for household rags, material for craft projects, etc.), There are certain items that are likely to be hanging around your home that should be discarded, both to free up space and to prevent further use. Expired food, condiments, and spices, as well as old makeup are examples of things that should be thrown out immediately to avoid future use. Do a regular cleanup of these items every few months to avoid a build-up of old items.

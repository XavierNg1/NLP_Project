 The main benefit of caffeine use to improve your fitness is the drug’s ability to mobilize fat stores and encourage the use of fat as fuel for your muscles. Glycogen is your muscle’s favorite fuel, not fat, and caffeine postpones access to your glycogen reserves. This means your body may burn fat more quickly and more effectively, and that your workouts may last longer, as glycogen reserves will be depleted less quickly., An occasional, large dose of strong coffee — two to three cups of strongly brewed coffee — taken an hour before a muscle-building workout can diminish the pain you feel.In turn, you may be able to push yourself further during a weightlifting session or other strength-training exercise. This may ultimately lead to greater muscle growth.Caffeine may also help you retain muscle as you age. In this case, steady, moderate caffeine use can contribute to long-term fitness, and even help prevent age-related injuries., Improved circulation helps get oxygen to your muscles, which can improve performance and keep your working longer. A Japanese study found that people who regularly drank coffee experienced increased blood flow of 30% over a period of 75 minutes.Improved circulation means more oxygen being delivered to your muscles.

, Bali is not big, but the geography and style of accommodation can vary widely. Understanding a few things about the geography of Bali is best. Read the descriptions of the areas found on the “Where to Stay” page of Bali Hotel Guide.
 Choosing a hotel that is closer to the beach or center of town will generally be more expensive. Most hotels and villas are within a short walk, bicycle ride or easy taxi ride to the beach. Other areas are smaller so relative popularity, size and amenities will determine a hotels’ price and value.
 Staying in a villa offers the freedom and comfort of home while on vacation. Many luxury villa rentals include staff for cooking and driving, which is a huge perk. In addition, Bali has many charming bungalows that are authentic Balinese or Javanese-style accommodation. There are also many modern city hotels offering convenience and efficiency at a low price to choose from.
 The traffic in Bali can sometimes be hard to maneuver, so choosing a hotel close to the Ngurah Rai Bypass or Sunset Road could make transportation quicker and easier. Find more on the maps section of the Bali Hotel Guide website. Remember however, that the rural areas in Bali are also very pleasant, quiet and conducive to relaxation and enjoyment.

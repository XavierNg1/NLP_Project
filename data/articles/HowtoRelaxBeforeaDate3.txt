 Like anything else in life, you will probably be less stressed out about your date if you feel well prepared for it.One thing you can do, if you are the one planning the evening, is to make sure you have everything planned out well in advance.


For example, if you are going out for dinner, make reservations in advance. Have any travel arrangements taken care of. Buy those movie tickets online, so you don't have to worry about it selling out. All of these mean one less thing you have to worry about.
 Take the time to get yourself extra clean. Nobody wants to worry about body odor during their date. Don't forget the importance of dental hygiene for fresh breath.No matter who you are dating, a little extra effort is always appreciated.
 Dress nicely and appropriately for your date. You want to look your best, but you don't want to overdo it either. You'll look silly wearing a tuxedo to a pizza restaurant.Dressing well can also help boost your feeling self-confidence., Are you worried about what to say on your date? Many people get nervous and don't know what to talk about on first dates, but if you plan some "icebreaker" questions in advance, you'll have some conversation starters ready that will also help you get to know your date better.Think about questions that can get someone to open up and share information about themselves, without getting too personal. You might ask, for example, "What was your favorite book when you were young?" or "What is the strangest thing that's ever happened to you?"Anything that might lead to some laughs is a good idea too.

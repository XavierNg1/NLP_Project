 If you have little or no money on hand and you want to make a real estate investment, borrowing money from family and friends is another option. Be sure to write up an official promissory note with payment due dates, a specific interest rate, and what ownership, if any, the lender will have in the property. If you pay back the loan on time and with interest, these lenders might be willing to lend to you again for future projects.


Consider whether the relationship you have with your lender could be harmed if you were unable to repay the loan. Ask yourself if securing real estate is worth endangering your relationship with someone close to you.
 Find a bank who will allow you to take out a loan for a down payment on top of the mortgage loan you have on your own house. This could be a line of credit or a second mortgage using your home as collateral. Look for a low interest rate that will allow you to purchase the property economically enough that you can still make a profit later on your investment.Make sure you can pay back this loan or you risk losing your own home. You will also have to have a credit score in the high 600s to take out this type of loan.
 Internet micro lending services (also called peer to peer lending) help borrowers find lenders for relatively small loans, usually under $35,000. Research these sites and familiarize yourself with all of the rules and regulations in order to avoid misunderstandings later.Popular micro lending sites include Kiva, Prosper and Lending Club.

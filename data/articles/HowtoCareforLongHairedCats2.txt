 That way, your cat will get any needed vaccines, as well as getting checked for any underlying conditions.

Make sure your cat's eyes are clear and bright, and don't have any goop coming out of them.
Whenever your cat comes indoors, if he is outdoor, run your hands over his fur and check for ticks. If you feel a bump, check it out. If it is in fact a tick, remove it.
Look at the ears. They should be pink with no goo and no odor.
Watch your cat. Make sure he doesn't limp.

If your cat does not pass your home health check, take him to the vet.



If you can, take him on walks.

Buy your cat a variety of toys, such as fishing rod toys, fake mice, and laser pointers.

Play with your cat daily.
 If your cat's teeth weren't brushed as a kitten, your cat may hate it and scratch you. If your cat scratches you or bites you when you try to brush his teeth, give him a FEW tartar control treats a day.

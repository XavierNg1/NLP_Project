, How does the short and long hands look like at each time given?

,

12:00, both arms would be straight in front.






3:00, left arm straight forward, right arm straight right.






6:00, both arms would be over your head pointing towards the other way.






9:00, right arm straight forward, left arm straight left.
 What if someone were to tell you, at every intersection to use a specific clock mimic movement and walk in that path? How would you go straight or turn in regards to the times listed?

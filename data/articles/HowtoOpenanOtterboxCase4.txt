 The Symmetry series is one of Otterbox's simplest cases: a flexible silicone enclosure for your phone. The seal is tight, so you'll have the best luck starting from a corner and pushing the case off the edge. Otterbox recommends starting at the top edge., Wedge the card under an edge of the flexible case. Lever it back and forth to pry the case away from the device enough to grasp it with your finger.
 Once you have a corner off, you can work your way around the edge of the case to remove it. Be careful with the port covers so that they don't get torn.

 You can avoid ingrown hairs by regularly exfoliating and moisturizing your skin in the weeks before and after the waxing session.


Use a body scrub, loofah or washcloth to exfoliate your skin, or make your own exfoliating body scrub using sugar or salt.
Follow up with a lightweight moisturizing lotion -- if your skin feels sensitive after the wax, make sure it is color and fragrance free.
 A good tip to make your waxing session more effective is to sprinkle a little baby powder on your (clean) skin before waxing.


The baby powder soaks up any moisture or oil from the surface of your skin and helps the wax to stick to the hairs better.
 It's important to get the temperature right, as burning yourself with hot wax is no fun at all!


Once you've melted the wax, test the temperature by applying a little to the inside of your wrist. The skin here is very sensitive, so if it feels okay, the wax should be at a safe temperature to apply to the rest of your body.
However, it's important that the wax is not too cold either, otherwise it won't spread properly!

, In order for hair to adhere to the wax and be effectively removed, hair must be at least 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) to 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) in length.


Therefore, you should avoid shaving or using any other hair removal methods in the week or two running up to your waxing session. It may be hard to resist -- but you'll get a much smoother result in the end.
You also need to be wary of hair that's too long -- use a safety scissors to trim long hair to about 1/2 on inch in length for more efficient waxing., Waxing the same area twice can be very painful and even damaging to the already-sensitive skin. So if you notice any hairs that you missed, just use a tweezers to pluck them out instead.

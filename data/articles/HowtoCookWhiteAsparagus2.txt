 Pour 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6) of water into the bottom half of a vegetable steamer. Add the lemon juice to the water, then bring the liquid to a boil over medium-high heat.

You can use any large pot for this as long as you have a steamer basket that can sit inside without touching the bottom of the pot. Avoid using aluminum cookware, however, since aluminum can have a negative chemical reaction to minerals in the asparagus.
Note that the lemon juice should get into the steam and help reduce discoloration as a result.
 Use a vegetable peeler to remove the thick skin from the outside of each asparagus spear. Cut off roughly 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) from the woody stem end of each spear.

The exact amount you should trim will vary depending on the thickness of the spear.
Peel the spears from top to bottom, starting 1-1/2 inches (3.75 cm) from the tip. Lay the spears flat on their sides while peeling them since upright peeling may cause them to snap.
 Place the steamer basket over the boiling water, then arrange the asparagus into an even layer inside the basket. Cover and cook for 20 to 30 minutes.

The exact amount of time will vary depending on the thickness of the asparagus. Check after roughly 20 minutes by piercing the thickest spear with a fork. If you can easily pierce the spear all the way through, the asparagus should be ready.
 Remove the finished white asparagus from the heat and lightly toss it with melted butter for flavor. Serve while it's still hot.

Alternatively, you could serve steamed white asparagus with a traditional hollandaise sauce for something will a little more kick.

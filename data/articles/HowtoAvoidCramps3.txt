 Consider incorporating some of the following foods into your diet:


Foods with high levels of potassium.Some of these foods are, in order from least to greatest potassium level: avocados, potatoes, bananas, broccoli, orange juice, soybeans, apricots, and raisins. You can have these at any time, not just while exercising.
Whole milk. Milk has a large amount of vitamin D, which will reduce your chances of cramping. Have one to two glasses of milk each day to help you prevent cramps. As a bonus, all the calcium in whole milk will also contribute to healthy bone growth.
 Lack of vitamin D can contribute to cramping; luckily, sunshine is chock full of vitamin D. Make sure to apply plenty of sunscreen before spending a day in the sun! Studies have shown that sunscreen application does not significantly diminish the body's absorption of vitamin D from sunlight.If you choose to exercise out in the sun, be extra sure to bring plenty of water.
Depending on your activity, consider bringing a pair of sunglasses to protect your eyes.
 Eating a large meal shortly before exercising can cause you to experience cramps. The amount of time you should wait between eating and working out depends on how much you have eaten. After a large meal, wait an hour or more. After a small meal or snack, give it 15-30 minutes.


If you prefer to perform rigorous exercise first thing in the morning, it is wise to have something small to eat first, such as a piece of fruit or yogurt. Exercising on an empty stomach can cause discomfort for some people.

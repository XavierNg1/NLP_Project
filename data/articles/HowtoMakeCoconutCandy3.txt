 To make this traditional Jamaican treat, you only need a few simple ingredients:


2 brown coconuts
1 cup of fresh ginger, diced
2 cups of golden brown sugar, packed
3 cups of water

, Take your fresh brown coconuts and use a screwdriver to poke holes through the eyes of the nut. Drain the coconut water from the center of the coconuts -- use or discard as you wish!


Use a hammer to crack the coconuts open and use a butter knife to pry the coconut meat from the shell. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the brown outer layer from the meat, then use a knife to dice the coconut.

Tip: You can make it easier to remove the coconut meat from the shell by baking the drained coconut in a 400 degree F oven for 10 minutes. Allow the coconut to become cool to the touch before cracking with the hammer.
 Combine the diced coconut, diced ginger, brown sugar and water in a heavy bottomed-saucepan and place over a medium heat., Stir the mixture continuously with a large spoon until it boils and the sugar starts to caramelize. Keep stirring as the mixture thickens to prevent the sugar from sticking to bottom and sides of the saucepan. Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature -- you want it to reach approximately 295 °F (146 °C)., Once the sugar has caramelized nicely and the mixture becomes very difficult to stir, turn the heat down to the lowest setting. Working quickly, spoon drops of the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with waxed paper, using about two tablespoons of mixture per coconut drop. Allow the drops to cool and harden before eating.

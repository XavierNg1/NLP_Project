 If you’re trying to memorize a paragraph, start by memorizing it one sentence or clause at a time. It’s a lot easier to remember little pieces than it is to memorize chunks. Consider the difference between memorizing 634 - 284 and trying to retain 634284.Try spending a half hour or so copying and reading aloud one sentence, then take a break. During your break, say the sentence to yourself a few times to reinforce it. After your break, move on to the next sentence.
 Write out the quote by hand, and try speaking the words out loud as you copy them. If your quote is more than a few sentences, copy one sentence at a time. If your hand can handle it without cramping up, try to copy the quote at least five times.It might be quicker and easier to type out a quote, but copying it by hand is a better learning and memorization method., After reading a sentence or clause out loud as you copy it, look away or cover the page. See if you can repeat it by heart. If you need a reminder, glance back at the page, then look away and try again.Once you’ve memorized one line, move on to the next and gradually build the quote up one clause at a time.
 Practicing every day is especially helpful if your quote is more than a sentence or two. Try committing one sentence or line to memory one day then, the next day, build on what you've previously mastered.

Practicing a little every day will also help prevent you from getting overwhelmed. If you're too stressed, you might get distracted and have a harder time memorizing your quote.

 This fairly standard phrase is a neutral way to ask someone to be quiet without any insulting connotations. You may, for instance, hear teachers use this to quiet students during study time. "Shizukani" is pronounced "shih-zoo-kah-knee." The first syllable uses the short i sound (as in "pit"), while the last syllable uses the long e sound (as in "tea"). Note that the last syllable here doesn't have the extra-long emphasis used in "yakamashī."


This phrase is written "静かに".
This option is still a little abrupt and forceful to use with strangers, so you'll probably want to opt for the phrase below if you want to be extra-delicate.
 This is one of the most polite ways you can ask someone else to be quiet — for instance, it's perfect for hushing noisy people around you in a movie theater. "Shizukani" is pronounced exactly as in the step above. "Shite" is pronounced "she-tay" (use the long e sound as in tea for the first syllable). "Kudusai is pronounced "koo-dah-sigh." Once again, the u sound is made without moving the lips forward.


This phrase is written "静か に して ください".
Remember the word "kudasai" — it's Japanese for "please," so you'll end up using it a lot if you learn more common Japanese phrases.
 If you ask someone to be quiet politely and they do quiet down, don't forget to say thanks! "Arigatō" is an all-purpose Japanese way to say "thank you." It's pronounced "ah-ree-gah-toe." Use the delicate Japanese r sound made with a flick of your tongue described above. You'll also want to hold the final o sound a little longer than normal (just like you did for the ī in "yakamashī")


This phrase is written "ありがとう".
For "thank you very much," you can say "arigatou gozaimasu." "Gozaimasu" is pronounced "go-zye-moss." Note that the second syllable rhymes with "eye" and the u at the end is not pronounced. This phrase is written "ありがとう ございます".

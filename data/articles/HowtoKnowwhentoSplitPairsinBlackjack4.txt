 The examples in the sections above are hard and fast rules that should rarely (if ever) be broken. For other pairs, the best course of action usually depends on the card the dealer is showing. For example, pairs of twos, threes, and sevens should be split when the dealer shows a relatively low card. If the dealer has an eight or better showing, just take a hit.


Some resources recommend splitting twos and threes (but not sevens) when the dealer shows an eight., If the dealer has a seven or better, just take a hit. Mathematically, you're more likely to beat weak dealer hands if you split your sixes. If the dealer is likely to have a stronger hand, your best bet is to hit and improve your hand — you'll only bust out if you get a 10 or face card.
 If the dealer has a seven, ten, or ace showing, don't hit — instead, stand. Hitting on an 18 is borderline-suicidal. Anything but a two or three will make you bust out.

 You do not want to freeze wet berries. This will cause frost damage, and the berries may stick together. Make sure to gently pat your berries dry with a paper towel prior to storing them in the freezer., In order to keep the berries from sticking together, you should freeze them on a sheet of wax paper. Lay the berries you wish to freeze down on a sheet of wax paper placed over a baking sheet. Make sure the berries do not touch. Only line the sheet with a single layer of berries.How long they take to freeze depends on the amount you're freezing and the strength of your freezer. Check on the raspberries every half hour ago until they're hard and frozen throughout.
 Leave the berries on the wax paper until they're completely frozen. Once they're frozen separately on the sheet of paper, it's safe to transfer them to a zip lock bag. The berries will stay separate in the bag after freezing on the sheet., You can also sweeten the berries before storing them. They can later be used for something like jam. You can sweeten them using a syrup made of water and sugar. Simply mix one part water with one part sugar.Place the berries in a sealable container, such as a mason jar.
Pour in your syrup mixture until there's about half an inch of headspace on the top of the jar.
Seal the jar and place the berries in the freezer.

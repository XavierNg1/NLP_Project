 Keep your hair natural and whimsical. Messy bohemian styles best capture the fairy look.


If you have long hair, wear it down or in braids.
For those who prefer shorter hair, consider a pixie cut or a messy bob. Fairy-like details include piece-y (not perfectly even) bangs and tousled hair.
Adorn your hair with ribbons and flowers. Antique pins and barrettes also make for a nice fairy look.



Even out your complexion with a light-weight tinted moisturizer.
If you are especially fair, apply a rosy blush to your cheeks.
Apply a shimmering powder to your cheekbones.
Use a highlighter pencil under your brow bone.
 Fairy beauty is fresh, glowy and wide-eyed.


Wear lip-gloss or a sheer lipstick. Look for products with shimmer. Avoid matte lipsticks, as these are too heavy. Good color choices include pink, red and wine.
Widen your eyes with mascara and light eye-shadow. Choose a good mascara and use only one coat to avoid heavy, spidery lashes. Look for light, shimmering shadows. Mocha, silver and moss-green are some good color options.
 Fairy fashion is feminine and ethereal, old-fashioned and romantic.


Wear long skirts and flowy dresses. Look for gossamer fabrics and filigree detailing.
Err on the side of demure. In summer, you can show your arms, shoulders and perhaps some décolleté, but avoid hems that are too high (think thigh-high) and plunging necklines.
For your winter wardrobe, check out the winter fashions of 19th-century Russia. The long coats, muffs and round hats capture the romantic fairy look.
Accessorize with headbands and jewelry. Again, antique designs, beads, ribbons and flowers create a romantic and whimsical fairy look.
Fairies are often barefoot, but this is not practical. Flat shoes, sandals and Mary Janes are excellent choices. Low-heeled shoes are acceptable, but exceedingly high, stiletto heels are not compatible with the free and easy fairy look.

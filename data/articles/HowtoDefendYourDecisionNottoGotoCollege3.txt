 Telling your parents you don’t want to go to college can be really scary. Lay out your reasons for not wanting to go and then tell them you’d like their help in making a different plan for your life after high school.


Start the conversation by saying, "Mom and Dad, I wanted to talk to you about my plans for after high school. I know you always really wanted me to go to college, but I'm not sure if that's the right path for me. I was hoping we could talk about my options."

, If you don’t plan on attending college, sit down and write a plan for where you want to be in five years and then ten years. Write down what you want to be doing, where you want to be living, and how much money you want to be making.Your plans can be as detailed or as general as you like - just make sure they have goals that you can strive for. For example, list each year of the next 5 or 10, and then under the year list the things you want to have accomplished each year. They can be large or small.
Your five year plan might include where you want to be in school, when you want a promotion at work, or how much money you want to be able to save each year.
 If a lot of your friends are planning to go off to college, you might feel a little abandoned, or like no one understands what your experience will be like. Look for people in similar situations, or rely on friends who are remaining in the area, to support and spend time with you after the summer is over.

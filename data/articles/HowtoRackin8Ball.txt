 Most pocket billiard tables are marked with a white dot inside a black circle at either end of the table, about halfway between the corner and side pockets. The foot spot is the spot furthest from the end of the table where the players stand during the break shot.;
,, You may use any of the seven solid or seven striped balls. Many players like to use the 1-ball, but the United States Professional Pool players Association (UPA) Official Rulesdo not require it, nor do the rules of the World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA).You do have to place the 1-ball in the apex position when playing either 9-Ballor 10-Ball, however.
 This is done to make it equally likely that either a solid or a striped ball will be knocked into a pocket on the break. If this happens, the breaking player usually elects to shoot at that type of ball and continue playing.
 The balls do not have to be placed in a particular order or pattern of solids and stripes, although most players try to balance the placement of solids and stripes to make it equally likely either kind of ball can be sunk on the break. The usual choice is to place a solid and a stripe side-by-side at the base of the inner triangle of balls (as shown in the figure.)

, This is done to reduce the likelihood of the 8-ball being pocketed on the break, which would result in an automatic win for the player shooting the break when playing under UPA rules, provided the break is otherwise legal., This is commonly done by pushing the triangle slightly forward and pulling it back while using your fingers to push the balls forward against the apex of the triangle. Be sure to return the position of the rack so that the ball at the apex of the triangle rests directly over the foot spot.


If the table has flaws that prevent you from placing the apex ball directly over the foot spot, the UPA’s rules allow you to place it within a dime’s radius (half the width of a dime) of the foot spot.

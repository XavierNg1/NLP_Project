 Department store websites and the official websites of well-known brands are a good place to start. If you buy from smaller stores or individual sellers, opt for sellers that go through PayPal or other secure payment methods.
 Only purchase from individual sellers when a detailed feedback system is available. Sellers with a 100% approval rating may be skewing their results, so you should aim for sellers who have vastly positive reviews and a few “resolved” negatives. Resolved negatives include any problem that was remedied after communication between the buyer and seller.
 When buying brand name items, be aware of the fact that many sellers are out to scam you. Know the peculiarities of a particular brand and look for detailed pictures that can be used to identify a garment as real or fake.
 Your name and address are necessary, but your Social Security number and bank account are not. If a feel skeptical about whether or not a seller is asking for unnecessary personal information, err on the side of safety.
 Websites that start with "https://" are secured, and many Internet browsers also display a closed padlock to indicate encrypted security. These security measures are not necessary while viewing products, but you should avoid websites that have you pay on unsecured pages.
 Before you commit to a purchase, verify whether or not a seller offers returns and refunds. Even a legitimate seller who does not offer returns can be a mistake to buy from, since you may find yourself stuck with an unusable product if it does not fit.

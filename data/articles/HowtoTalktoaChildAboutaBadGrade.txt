 Tell them that without good grades, many people won't be interested in hiring them for a job when they grow up.;
, It's fine to be upset with your child, but calling him/her a "failure" or commenting on his/her "stupidity" will only cause a decrease in self esteem. Degrading remarks can hurt more than you know. Let the child know that they've gotten a bad grade, but that doesn't mean they're bad kids! It just means they have to work a little harder.
 Make sure it is not too extreme however. Taking away phone, TV, or computer privileges is always an option.
 This can encourage the same sort of grades in the future. Verbal praise can sometimes mean more than a purchased reward- remember to consider that! A milkshake from a favorite diner and a "Wow! I'm so proud of you!" will get the job done right.
 If your child is utterly trying his/her best, and yet can only get about a C average, accept this. Some children do not excel in certain areas.

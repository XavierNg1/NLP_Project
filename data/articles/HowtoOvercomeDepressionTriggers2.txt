 You are capable of taking action and overcoming your depression triggers. Accept yourself without self-hate and believe that you are powerful and in control. Your emotions are your own and no one else's. You have the power to transform what you think and how you feel.


Motivation to change alone may not be all you need to overcome depression and those triggers. But it is the starting point to becoming a happier and healthier person.
Choose a mantra to say to yourself, such as "I choose peace" or "I forgive myself" or "Relax, release, ease.", While there are some situations in life that can make anyone feel sad, there are ways to reframe a negative emotion or situation into a positive one. While bad things happen, it is how you cope that is important. It can take time to retrain your brain, so don't give up even if it takes time.Here is an example of a trigger that may lead to depressive thoughts: You exercised at the gym. You thought that you didn't push yourself hard enough. You felt disappointed or not good enough.
Now here is a more positive approach: You exercised at the gym. You thought that you did a good job of going to the gym and that you will continue to work hard to achieve your fitness goals. You felt satisfied and happy.

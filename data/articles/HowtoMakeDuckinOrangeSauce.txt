 Season the duck breasts with salt and pepper and set aside on a tray or plate.;
, In one of the pans, mix the orange juice, stock, wine and orange zest. Bring to the boil and reduce. If you like a sweeter taste add 3 tbsp of sugar now.
 In the other frying pan, cook the duck for 12 minutes, skin-side down. At this point, the duck will be medium cooked. If you prefer well done, leave for longer. Remove the fat and add the soy sauce. Now turn the duck to the other side and let it sit in the pan for 10 minutes on the stove without any heat. Spoon the soy sauce over the duck.
 After this resting period, cut the duck breasts into half, lengthwise. Place the 4 pieces into the frying pan with the reduced orange sauce. Heat gently on low heat till thoroughly warmed. When the sauce is reduced check the consistency.
 Place the breasts on a plate and pour some of the sauce over each one.
 The duck with orange sauce needs to be served as soon as it is cooked. It is very rich and only needs steamed vegetables to complete it. Garnish with a spring of parsley to add to its brown and orange colour.

 You don't want your important intellectual findings to be unclear because you misspelled a few words in your introductory paragraph. Make sure to utilize spell check, and correct any errors that are highlighted. It is also a good idea to make sure that your software is also set to check grammar and style. Use spell check, but do not overly rely on it. Remember, you know what your paper is supposed to say--your computer is not familiar with the points you are making.
 In addition to spelling and grammar, you need to edit for content. Read a draft of your paper, and make sure that your points are all clear and concise. This is also a great time to make sure that your writing flows smoothly., During the editing process, it can be very helpful to read your paper out loud. This can help you catch errors that you might have skimmed over during your first read. Reading out loud can be very helpful in catching any awkward phrases., A second set of eyes is always helpful during the writing process. Recruit a classmate, family member or friend and ask them to look over your paper. Remember, choose someone you trust to be both thorough and honest., Go back one more time and make sure that you have fulfilled all of the requirements. Have you numbered your pages? Used the required font size? All of these things are important. Double-check everything. Then you can breathe easily once you have turned in your paper.

 You’ll need an oversized headscarf for this style., Drape your headscarf over your hair with the pointed end in the back. The folded side should be in the front. You can choose to put it on your forehead, directly on your hairline, or a few inches back to show the color of your hair.
 If you want to make the scarf more secure, you can twist the scarf at the point that it’s crossed.
 Take the two ends of your headscarf one more time and cross them. Throw them over your shoulders.

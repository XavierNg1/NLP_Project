 Many people save all of their passwords in a text document so that they don't have to remember all of them. If you're able to get on their computer, you may be able to find this file.
 There's a good chance that if they did create a document with their passwords that it will be stored in the Documents folder. Search through the folder to see if you can find one.
 This may help you track down a document that has been stored elsewhere on the computer.
 Open up the target's word processor and check the Recent Files list to see if the password document has been opened recently.

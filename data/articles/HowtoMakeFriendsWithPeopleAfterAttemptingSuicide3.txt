 If you have high self-esteem this may help people see you as a more positive person, which may make it easier for you to make friends and meet new people. Having low self-esteem may result in people thinking of you as somewhat hostile. This can result in social avoidance.


Make a list of things you like about yourself. Review this list every day to up your self-esteem.
Love yourself and remind yourself you have people who care about you.
Think of yourself as a survivor rather than a victim. You survived a suicide attempt and are looking to better your life.
 Individuals who have survived suicide attempts sometimes feel trapped in their lives.They may feel controlled by family, teachers, or therapists. Regaining a sense of control can help instill hope and optimism, which can make it easier to connect with others and make new friends., Many people who attempt suicide are left with many different and difficult emotions such as: nervousness, anger, loneliness, shame, sadness, and despair.Sometimes these emotions can lead you to want to avoid other people or limit your social contact. On the other hand, if you are able to cope healthfully with these negative emotions you can increase your ability to positively connect with others.


Engage in positive coping strategies such as: writing in a journal, meditating, practicing mindfulness, playing music, painting, drawing, reading, talking to a family member, or getting therapy. Explore new activities that you may not have thought of yet. Research new activities online or ask your new friend for ideas.
Exercise is a powerful coping technique. Try fun ways to get you moving such as: biking, hiking, rollerblading, skateboarding, swimming, running, dancing, yoga, or aerobics.
Avoid engaging in risky behaviors to cope. Using alcohol or other drugs can increase your risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

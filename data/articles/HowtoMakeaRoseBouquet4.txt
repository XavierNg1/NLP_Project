, Make it waterproof by lining it with tin foil or a sheet of plastic., Old-fashioned, scented roses are a really good addition to a basket bouquet as they are voluminous, soft and suit the basket style. You will need a lot of roses––a medium-sized basket bouquet could fit anywhere from 20 to 50 roses.

Prepare by removing all lower level leaves on each rose stem and cutting the stems at an angle.
 Dip it into a bowl of water to cover it completely. Hold it under the water. It is fully soaked when it doesn't pop up again., If it doesn't fit perfectly, wedge in some cut pieces of foam to keep it firmly tucked in place., Work your way around the foam methodically, starting at one end and ending up at the other end. Leave the handle of the basket free of roses, as you'll want to be able to pick it up and also see it as part of the design.

Depending on how you intend angling the basket when on display, it is best to place slightly taller roses at its back and shorter ones at the front.
 Place against a backdrop such as a wall or cabinet or use as a centerpiece.

It's a good idea to put a mat under the basket to soak up any additional moisture.

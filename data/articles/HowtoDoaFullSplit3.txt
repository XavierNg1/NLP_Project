 This is a yoga pose that is similar to a push-up position with your butt raised up to the sky. Lean against the ground with both palms firmly grounded and your hips lifting up high and back.Pause and rock back and forth on your legs a little bit to loosen up your legs more.
 Keep a steady deep breath and try to step forward on an exhale. You want your right foot to step out between your two hands so that it is planted in between them. Now start leaning into your left knee, which will naturally release the top of your left foot from the ground., The goal is to have your hands by your hips with your fingertips touching the ground. If you don’t feel flexible enough to do this yet, try using blocks to give your hands a higher surface to rest on. Once you have gotten your hands out to your side you can begin the process of slowly sinking the weight down into your hips., As you sink into your hips, flex your foot and let your right heel slowly move forward. Be smooth and breath deeply. As you do this, keep wiggling your left knee backwards to maintain an even weight.
 Don’t force your legs onto the floor. If they don’t fall down naturally while you breathe and sink your hips, just keep your hands propped up on the floor or on the blocks.
 If you try to roll out of the split you might hurt yourself.

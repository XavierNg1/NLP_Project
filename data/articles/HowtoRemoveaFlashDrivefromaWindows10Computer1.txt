 Doing so will invoke a drop-down menu.
 This option is at the bottom of the drop-down menu. It will typically say something like Eject SDHC (E:) with your flash drive's name written after the "Eject" prompt.
 Once this notification displays in the bottom-right side of your computer's screen, your flash drive is ready for removal.
 It should slide out. The next time you plug your flash drive into your computer, all of your files should be as you left them.

 The key to enjoy writing a diary is to write whenever you feel like it. Maybe something bad or great has happened in your life and you want to share it. A great place to share it is your diary. There are no laws or expectations as to how often you have to write in your diary. You can leave a diary for forty years and then return to it after a long diary break. See your diary as freedom.
 Your diary should reflect your personality. You should feel proud to open up your diary. Maybe you want a beautiful, colourful diary, or maybe just a notebook. You can even make your own home-made diary. Your diary can look plain on the outside, but decorated with pictures, drawings and photographs on the inside. Be creative.
 You aren't being judged, and nobody is reading your diary. You are free to write all your secrets, hopes, fears and dreams.
 A diary is a precious escape, where you can share anything and everything you want. You can look back on it in years to come, and review how you've evolved and changed. When everything is jumbled up into a messy knot in your head, by writing it down in a diary, you can undo this knot. So what are you waiting for?

, Your diary is full of your personal and private information. Nobody has the right to stick their nose into your world of secrets, so don't let them have the opportunity. Hide your diary well so that you know that it will never be found by anyone. Maybe you could write a fake diary to give people the wrong idea.
 It's fun and worthwhile.

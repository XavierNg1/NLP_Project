If you pour it in too fast, you will end up cooking the eggs., It is ready when the sides shrink back from the pan, and the center springs back when you press on it., If you used a spring form cake pan, simply open up the pan, and peel the sides away from the cake., For a fancier cake, cut the cake in half, and spread your favorite jam onto one of the halves before putting it back together.

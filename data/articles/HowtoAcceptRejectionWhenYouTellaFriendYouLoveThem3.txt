 Once you feel able to face your friend, arrange to meet up and talk. The two of you need to decide how to move forward with your friendship. If you just ignore it, your friendship may suffer. So, call out the elephant in the room and have the tough conversation.You might say, “So, I still want to be your friend, but I can see I made you uncomfortable. How are we going to move on from this?”
Actively listen to what the other person has to say. Find out exactly how they are feeling and what they are thinking. Brainstorm solutions to reduce any awkwardness or resentments.
 If the two of you are able to resume the friendship and fall back into old patterns, your old feelings may re-emerge. If this happens, don’t try to change their mind, or convince them that they should date you. Your friend made it clear that they weren’t interested in you that way, so respect their choice.You may have to decide if you are able to continue being friends with the person. You may have to go separate ways if you are unable to control your feelings and if they don't go away over time.
 Your friend may feel uncomfortable hanging out with you after you revealed your deeper feelings. In a similar vein, you may still feel humiliated about the rejection. No matter how hard you two work to salvage the friendship, you may find yourselves spending less time together.


Accept that once love enters the picture, things change. Be okay with not spending as much time with the person, if that’s what either of you wants.
Your friendship might not improve until both of your are in fulfilling relationships, so be prepared for it to take a lot of time for things to get better between you.

 When you're repaying a line of credit, it's important to set a timeline for repayment. The following formula will help you figure out how much you will have to pay each month to repay for your credit line balance within a certain number of months or years. The formula is: P=r(PV)1−(1+r)−n{\displaystyle P={\frac {r(PV)}{1-(1+r)^{-n}}}}. In the formula, the variables stand for the following:

P is the monthly payment. This is the result of the equation.

r is the monthly interest rate. This is the annual interest rate divided by 12. The interest rate is also expressed as a decimal in the equation, so 0.5% would be 0.005 (0.5/100=0.005). 

PV is the present value, or the current outstanding balance on your credit line.

n is the number of periods. This is the number of months in which you want to pay off your credit line. So, three years would be entered as -36 (3 years * 12 months/year). 

Note that this value is input as a negative number. This does not refer to a negative number of months, but is simply a mathematical construct., Two of the variables, r and PV, will come from your credit line's billing statement. Keep in mind that your interest rate, r, will have to be entered as a monthly interest rate. The only variable you will have to come up with is your repayment period, n. This can be any number you choose, but keep in mind that a larger value will result in smaller payments and a smaller value will result is larger payments (but less overall interest paid).

For example, imagine you owe $10,000 on a line of credit with an annual interest rate of 6%. You want to pay the balance off within three years. So, your inputs are $10,000 for PV, 0.005 for r (6%/12 and then divided by 100 to get decimal form), and -36 for n. 


, Input your variables into the equation and then solve using the correct order of operations. The equation, completed using the example data, looks like this: P=0.005($10,000)1−(1+0.005)−36{\displaystyle P={\frac {0.005(\$10,000)}{1-(1+0.005)^{-36}}}}

First, solve the addition within parentheses (1+0.005). The example is now: P=0.005($10,000)1−(1.005)−36{\displaystyle P={\frac {0.005(\$10,000)}{1-(1.005)^{-36}}}}

Next, solve the exponent. This is done on a calculator by first entering the lower number (1.005 in this case), pressing the exponent button (usually xy{\displaystyle x^{y}}), and then entering the higher number (-36 here) and pressing enter. The example is now: P=0.005($10,000)1−(0.836){\displaystyle P={\frac {0.005(\$10,000)}{1-(0.836)}}}

Note that the result, 0.836, is a rounded figure. If you do not round, you may get a different result.



Solve the multiplication in the numerator (0.005($10,000)). The example is now: P=$501−(0.836){\displaystyle P={\frac {\$50}{1-(0.836)}}}

Solve the subtraction in the denominator (1-0.836). The example is now: P=$500.164{\displaystyle P={\frac {\$50}{0.164}}}

Finally, solve the division to get your answer. The answer solves to $304.87. So, your monthly payment will have to be $304.87 each month to pay off your $10,000 credit line balance in three years. 


, You can adjust the payment time to find an acceptable monthly payment or time schedule. Keep in mind, again, that a shorter repayment period will expensive as far as payments go but will be overall cheaper in interest paid (because interest has less time to accrue).

If you have additional annual payments or monthly fees, or if your interest rate changes each year, you can use an online calculator to find your required payments.

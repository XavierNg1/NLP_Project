 In the first tab, open up YouTube.com. In the second window, open URL Zamzar (zamzar.com/url). Finally, in the third window, open up Mailinator.com.;
, Make sure that you've found the right video. Listen to it all the way through to guarantee that it doesn't skip, or cut off part of your music at the end.
 Copy and past the video URL into the box on your Zamzar page. Change the format to mp3.
 In order to send you your file, Zamzar requires an email address. To keep your inbox from being flooded with music, I recommend creating a Mailinator account. This program is an alternate email provider that sets up instantly - you don't even have to let them know you're coming! To activate your account, simply stay on the Zamzar page. Type any address into the box under "Step 3", followed by '@mailinator.com'.
 Press the "Covert" button and wait for your file to process. Depending on the size of your piece and how busy the site is, your song may take several minutes to upload, or as little as a few seconds.
 Open up your mailinator tab and log into your new account (no password required). When your email comes, open it up and press the "Download" button. A new window will pop up. Again, press "Download" and select the destination for your file.
 Click and drag your downloaded file into the Music section of iTunes, or into your Library (Windows Media Player). From these two applications, you can sync to your device or burn a mix CD.

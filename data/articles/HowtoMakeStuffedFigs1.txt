 Wash 12 fresh figs. Use a sharp knife to cut off 1/2-inch (1.25 cm) from the top of each fig. You can throw away the trimmed ends. Slice an "X" down into each fig so that you slice three-quarters of the way through the fig. Use your fingertips to gently pull the fig open a little.The figs should be able to sit upright. If they wobble onto their sides, trim a little off of the bottom so they stand up.;
, Measure out Â¼ cup (60 g) of mascarpone cheese into a small bowl. Add 2 teaspoons of honey and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Stir the filling mixture together until the honey and vanilla are incorporated. Scoop 1 teaspoon of the filling into the center of each split fig.For a unique flavor, swap the vanilla extract with rose water or almond extract.
 Arrange the stuffed figs on your serving plate and get out toasted almonds, fresh mint, and an orange. Drizzle the last teaspoon of honey over the figs. Chop the almonds so you have 2 tablespoons and chop the mint, so you have 1 teaspoon. Sprinkle these over the figs and zest a little of the orange. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of orange zest over the figs and serve them.You can also garnishing the figs with chopped pistachios instead of the almonds.

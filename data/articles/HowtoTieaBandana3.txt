 Lay the bandana out flat. Take one of the corner triangles and bring it towards the middle of the bandana. Fold it so that the tip of the triangle reaches approximately 2 inches below the opposite corner of the bandana.
 Pick up the bandana by each end and bring it up to your forehead. Make sure that the flat edge of the bandana sits just above your eyebrows. Move the ends of the bandana around the back of your head, so the back is about level with your ears.
 Tie the bandana with a simple, square knot. Tuck in the overhanging top corner behind the knot. Smooth down the hair on top of your head and make sure the bandana is snug.

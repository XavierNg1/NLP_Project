 To start painting on canvas, first thing you need is an easel. When you are buying an easel, you need to decide what the main function of your easel will be. Also think about where you will do most of your painting. If you paint on the go, you need a small travel easel. If you paint in a small space, you need a compact, medium sized easel. If you have a large studio space, you can invest in a larger, more stable easel.;
, If you are looking for a travel easel, the most important thing to consider is weight and collapsing features. There are many different types. You can buy a lightweight aluminum one with collapsible tripod legs. You can also get one that folds up and fits into a travel case. Try models such as The Jullian Plein Air Easel PA1 or the Daler Rowney St Paulâ€™s Easel.
 If you have very little space, try a table easel. Use these on desks or tables of any size or height. Instead of long legs, they have a sturdy base that sits on any flat surface and don't take up room on the floor. They come in wood or metal and can be either H framed or collapsible. They can hold canvases as large as 35 inches. Most have a notched stand on the back that can shift to fit any angle needs. Try Reeve's Art & Craft Work Station or Windsor & Newton's Eden model.


If you have a little floor space to devote to your easel but not a large studio, there are some compact freestanding easels. They give great stability for small to medium sized canvases and can fold up smaller for easy, out of the way storage. They come in metal and wood. Look for models such as Windsor & Newton's Shannon or Mabefs Inclinable.
 Large studio easels are made for long term use. They are heavy duty and have the capability to hold large canvases. You can also get ones with masts big enough for you to work on the bottom of the canvas at eye level on any size canvas. Try the Best University or Santa Fe II models.

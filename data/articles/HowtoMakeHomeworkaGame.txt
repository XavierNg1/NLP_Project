A good way to organize your list is by subject and in the order your day proceeds. If your first subject is science, mark science as a category and write all your science homework under it. Then do the same for math (or whatever subject you have next), etc.;

Doing the hardest assignments first will make the rest seem easier, while saving them for last only makes them seem even harder when you finally get around to doing them.
Put what you want to do last at the top and what you want to do first at the bottom. It will give you motivation to finish the boring subjects first, and move on to the better, funner ones.
If you have too much homework to stack up in one pile, make two or even three piles, but make sure they don't crowd your workspace.

For example: 'You are an agent of the CTU {(Counter Terrorist Unit) (like Jack Bauer in 24)}. _______ (imaginary name) is a threat to national security. He/she has obtained _______ (nuclear weapons, masses of nerve gas, tear gas, or another WMD- Weapon of mass destruction) and plans on using them in _______ (densely populated city). You must stop him by ______________ (insane scheme with no chance of working that will save the country from this awful villain).'
This is obviously only an example. There are an infinite number of possibilities. You could go back in time to the medieval times and fight an impossible war, struggle to become president/emperor/king in modern times or in history, stave off an alien attack, colonize Mars, be the first to stand on the surface of the Sun or another star, etc, etc, etc.
 When you get to the climax (giving the pep talk to your knights, in the final election, in the spaceship to the sun, etc) stop and dive into your homework. Work as quickly and accurately as possible.
 Fifteen even, if you've got the time to spare, but no longer than that. Do something active for a little while, like jumping jacks or jogging around the house, then settle in back to your work area and take the plot of your game a little farther.
 Reward yourself by finishing the story and giving your game-self riches and prestige. If you wish, next homework session, be it tomorrow or next week, you could continue with this story, giving your character a new challenge to overcome. Or you could start fresh, with a whole new series of untapped adventures waiting.

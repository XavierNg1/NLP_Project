If you are planning on drawing or tie-dying your bag, you want a lighter background (e.g. white, cream, or light blue). Added colors will not show up on a dark background.
Dark colors such as navy or black are better background colors if you are adding things like patches, beads, glitter, or other appliques.;

Before you begin decorating, think about the type of message you want to convey., Make a list of everything you need to complete your project, this will save you time and prevent stress down the road.. Look around your house or apartment for supplies, or make a trip to a craft or fabric store.


Read any instructions carefully before starting any type of DIY or craft project.

 The easiest way to customize a schoolbag is by using fabric pens or sharpies to draw anything from abstract designs to people, animals, or landscapes. Lay your bag on a hard surface and place a piece of cardboard under the fabric to provide a flat surface to draw-on, and prevent colors from soaking through.


Purchase fabric pens or markers from a craft store. These come in different tip sizes, and the ink is designed to adhere to fabric. Regular permanent markers may fade or run overtime.Iron over the decorated area on a medium setting to help the colors to set.Remember you can't undo or erase your drawings. Make a sketch first on a piece of paper, and practice drawing with fabric markers on old jeans or a t-shirt before using them on your schoolbag.

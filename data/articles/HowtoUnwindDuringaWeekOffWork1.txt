 If you have a project hanging over your head during your vacation, you will not be able to relax. Finish major projects before you leave, even if it means working more. You’ll thank yourself later. Leave your team ready to continue in your absence. Before your vacation, spend the previous week making sure everyone else has what they need to do their jobs well. With everyone else able to continue getting the work done, you do not need to worry about it yourself.;
, If you have a plan for getting the work done, you will not feel overwhelmed by it. If your plan doesn’t include working on your vacation, you can reassure yourself that as long as you stick to the plan, it will get done.


Your plan should be specific. Include precisely what work will get done and when you will do it.Part of the stress of leaving work is the uncertainty about work that still needs doing. Your plan will help remove that uncertainty.
 You can set up your e-mail to auto-reply to e-mail you receive. This will let people know when you will be back and when they can expect a reply. This saves you from having to worry about unanswered e-mail.


Specify that you will not be able to check your e-mail for the entire duration of your time off work. This will help give you the freedom from feelings of obligation to check and respond to messages. Setting up the auto-reply message will depend on the e-mail client you use. Regardless, it is a simple process.
 This can be easier said than done. However, one of the most stressful things about a vacation can be thinking about all of the things that need to be done when you return.


Leave behind any physical work (e.g. paperwork), in the office. If you take it with you, you will feel pressured to work on it.
If you're really inclined to bring work home, lock it into your filing cabinet or cupboard at work and give a co-worker the key. Tell them to give the key back to you only when you return to work.

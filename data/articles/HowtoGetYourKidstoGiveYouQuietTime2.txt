 One of the best ways to spend quiet time for children is by practicing their reading skills. Depending on your children’s age, supply appropriate books for them to look at and read during this time period. Colouring books are worth considering for those not comfortable reading alone.


In addition to being a “quiet” activity, reading helps children develop strong vocabulary and offers cognitive stimulation.
If you have sound machines in each zone, children that read aloud are less likely to disturb other’s quiet., Quiet time can be a wonderful opportunity to exercise creativity. Stock each child’s quiet zone with materials that allow them to make art. Talk to each child to determine what medium they enjoy working with best.


For example, your child might enjoy using their quiet time to weave friendship bracelets. Another child might use this time to sculpt with modelling clay or paint watercolor pictures., Good old-fashioned play with dolls, trains, and action figures is healthy for your children. In the digital age, children spend an inordinate amount of time on technological devices. While these devices may be used in your home at other times, restrict quiet time activities to non-electrical toys to stimulate your children’s imaginations., Strategy and analysis are important skills for kids to develop, these are a great way to build these skills. Working on puzzles helps younger children develop fine motor skills through circling with word-find or turning a piece with a physical puzzle. In addition, all children receive enhanced cognitive skills by thinking through problems and devising the right answer.


Supply your children’s quiet zones with crossword puzzles, word search puzzles, and puzzle sets, jigsaws etc that allow them to develop these much-needed skills.

 Heat Capacity of an object can be calculated by dividing the amount of heat energy supplied (E) by the corresponding change in temperature (T). Our equation is: Heat Capacity = E / T.


Example: It takes 2000 Joules of energy to heat a block up 5 degrees Celsius -- what is the heat capacity of the block?
Heat Capacity = E / T
Heat Capacity = 2000 Joules / 5 C
Heat Capacity = 400 Joules per degree Celsius (J/C);
, For example, if I want to know the heat capacity of a block, and I know it took 60 Joules to raise the block from 8 degrees to 20 degrees, I need to know the difference between the two temperatures to get my heat capacity. Since 20 - 8 = 12, the temperature of the block changed by 12 degrees. Therefore:


Heat Capacity = E / T
Heat Capacity of the block = 60 Joules / (20C - 8C)
60 Joules / 12 C
Heat Capacity of the Block = 5 J/C

, A heat capacity of 300 means nothing if you don't know how it was measured. Heat Capacity is measured by energy needed per degree. So if we measure the energy in joules, and the change of temperature in Celsius, our final answer will represent how many Joules we needed per degree Celsius. Thus we would represent our answer as 300 J/C, or 300 Joules per degree celsius.


If you measure heat energy in calories and temperature in Kelvin, your final answer would be 300 C/K.
 When something becomes two degrees colder, it loses the exact same amount of heat as it would gain to become 2 degrees warmers. Thus, if you are asked, "What is the heat capacity of an object if it loses 50 Joules of energy and drops 5 degrees Celsius," you can still use our equation:


Heat Capacity: 50J / 5C
Heat Capacity = 10 J/C

 Pointed-toe flats are a classic look and pointed-toe lace ups are by far the trendiest design. The sharp toe looks sleek and polished, and these versatile shoes can be easily dressed up or down. Many people find them to be a fashionable alternative to heels. Because of their current popularity, you’ll find an extremely wide variety to choose from, as well as a range of price points.Pointed-toe lace ups are slimming for the legs, as opposed to a rounded toe, which can have an opposite effect. If you have muscular legs, go with a pointed-toe style.;
, The way the laces work for these flats can vary widely from brand to brand, so be sure to check out the many different designs. The crisscross laces are one of the most popular varieties. Look for laces that crisscross before you wrap them around the ankles. These look great with jeans and pants, since the crisscross detail adds an additional dimension to your outfit.When wearing this style, be sure to cuff your jeans just slightly above the ankle, which will expose the strappy lacework.
Try to find a pair with a zip closure at the heel, which makes them extremely easy to take off and on., Basic details are great, but definitely try out some of the more complex design features like peekaboo details, unusual lacework, studs, cut out details, tassels and embellished fabrics. The detail work is what makes these shoes so special, so the more the better. Plush materials like velvet, suede, leather, and snakeskin can really set lace up flats apart, as well.


Open toes, cutaway designs and cut out details can make legs appear longer and leaner, which is a bonus.Even when the design looks complex, the shoes typically aren’t hard to wear, so you don’t need to worry about that aspect.

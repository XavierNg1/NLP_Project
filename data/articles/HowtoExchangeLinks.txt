 This is the most important step. If your site is good, you will get links without asking for them. If not, only other low-quality sites will link to you.;
,, (Because their site, like yours if you followed step one, is worth linking to even if you don't get a return link.)

, Include your URL and a brief explanation of your site, their URL that you want the link from, and a meaningful subject line.
 Don't just bury their link among hundreds of others on a links page where nobody but a search engine will ever see it.

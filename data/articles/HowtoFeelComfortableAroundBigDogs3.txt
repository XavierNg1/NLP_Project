 By knowing how to read a dog's body language, you can deal with the dog appropriately. This way, you can avoid any negative interactions, such as a growl or a bite. A dog that indicates that it is shy or not ready to meet you should be left alone and given space.Shy dogs will move away or lean away to create more space. They might also have their head lowered with their tail tucked between their legs.A raised paw, yawning, and a licking of its lips accompanied with a lowered head are also signs that the dog is unsure of you., If the dog does not want to interact with you, never force it to. Forcing the dog to interact with you might cause it to growl or bite you. If the dog is standoffish, then give it space. By giving it space, it will understand that you respect it, and the dog will be more likely to approach you when it is ready., Treats are always a great way to get a dog to like you, and thus, be comfortable around you. This way, you will also be comfortable around the dog.When giving a dog a treat, do not dangle the treat in the air. This can cause the dog to stand on its hind legs or jump up to retrieve the treat. They have less control over the mouths when jumping up to retrieve a treat.Instead, place the treat in the palm of your hand. Make sure your palm is flat. Then, bring the treat close to the dogâ€™s face, i.e., under its mouth or at chest level. Let the dog lick the treat from your hand.

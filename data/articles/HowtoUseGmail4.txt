 This will allow you to view your contacts list. You can either add contacts while at the list or simply send a message to the person. The email will automatically be saved as a contact if you send a message to him/her.
 This will help you sort your contacts by groups of people, whether it's friends, coworkers, or people on your softball team. Click the plus sign with two people, next to the plus sign with one person. A pop up will come up asking you what you'd like to name the group.
 You may add a contact manually by clicking the plus sign with one person behind it. Gmail will ask for information on your contact as soon as you do this.


If necessary, you may edit a contact by selecting one, and clicking the edit button to the right.
Delete one by clicking the "Delete" button with a trash can while the contact is selected.
To delete a group, select the group, and click the "Delete Group" button.

 Even if your period of self-harming is behind you, seeking help can make the recovery and coping process much easier. Speak to your doctor about your options (which may include counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy), and consider whether there might be contributing factors that caused your self-harming behaviour in the first place, like an eating disorder or sexual abuse. Coming to terms with the behaviour and understanding it may change the way you view your scars, and how you wish to cover them., As part of your recovery process, you may wish to hide your self-harm scars with thick, camouflaging makeup. Choose a green-based concealer, which will cover the red undertones of your scars effectively. Dab the makeup over the scar until you are happy with the coverage, then pat the surface of your skin with a powder foundation.For best results, choose a concealer that closely matches your skin tone and avoid any that have brightening properties, which will draw attention to your scars.
 Book a consultation with a reputable tattoo artist to discuss the possibility of tattooing over a scar (or scars) left behind from your self-harming period. Bring a design to the consultation, or have a clear idea of what you want to have as a tattoo before meeting with them. Be sure that you are ready for the commitment of having a tattoo, taking into consideration how you might feel about it in the future.

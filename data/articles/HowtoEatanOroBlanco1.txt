 Use a sharp straight blade knife and cut off a large slice from the top and bottom of the fruit. Once cut, you should be able to see the exposed bare fruit at either end., Then, stand the fruit on a cutting board with one of the flat ends on the board. Begin slicing the fruit from top to bottom moving around the edge of the fruit. With each slice, try to remove the rind, pith, and membrane so that the bare fruit is exposed.Once you have finished cutting around the edge of the fruit, remove any remaining white pith or membrane with your knife.
 Holding the fruit in your hand, slice the fruit along one membrane towards the centre of the fruit. Then, make a similar cut along the adjacent membrane. This will produce small wedges or segments of oro blanco.Continue this process while rotating around the fruit and slicing individual segments.
 Place the segments of fruit into a bowl. You can eat the sliced fruit as is, or try adding the wedges to a citrus salad or fruit cocktail.

 You want to go back to the table with the mindset that the next draft needs to be a more polished form of the previous one, not an extension of it, not a 'fine tuning' of the previous one.
 The next draft should be written to clean up poor sentence structure, get the punctuation worked out, and try to make some of the vague ideas more concrete. If there are any elements that you have neglected to include, now is the time to work them in. Try to make it look like they belong where they end up, not like they were crammed in because they were forgotten until the third draft. Try to make the piece flow from idea to idea smoothly and cleanly.
 The third and final draft should directly follow the previous one, and should fix all the problems with the previous drafts. Get the sentence structure nailed down, and make sure that all the ideas are well stated and well placed within the piece. If anything feels like it needs 'tuning' this is the last opportunity. Get a clearly written and well stated essay on paper that, if handed to someone with only a little knowledge of the subject, could be understood without too many questions. Take care to use easy-to-read penmanship that you won't have to study to determine what you meant. Also, this is the time to adjust awkwardly worded phrasing.
 Read the piece, and look specifically for sentences that don't seem to work well as they are written, for statements that may be more suitable elsewhere within the piece. Using a red ink pen, jot down notes within the margin, clarify statements, correct order-of-words, and try to polish the essay to perfection.
 This is the first typed draft. Try to make it sound thoughtful, have it flow well, and clearly state whatever you have to state., Go over it with a fine-toothed comb, and locate any and every weakness. Correct any problems and type up the final copy, which will be handed in.

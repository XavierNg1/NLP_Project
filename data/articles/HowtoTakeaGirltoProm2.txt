 Girls spend the days before prom pampering themselves and you should do the same. Make an appointment for you and your friends to get your hair cut at your local barber.You might also spring for a straight razor shave if you feel like you need it.
Make your hair appointment for the morning of your prom.
 Plan to spend an hour getting yourself prom appropriate. Take a shower, brush your teeth, comb your hair and put on your tuxedo. Put on your tuxedo in the following order: tuxedo shirt (followed by cufflinks and studs), pants, shoes, vest, cummerbund, bowtie and jacket.If you have additional accessories, like suspenders, don't forget to put those on as well.
Ask your mom or dad to help you tie your bowtie.
Make sure you have everything you need: check for tickets, the corsage, cash and mints.
If you’re going to an after-prom party, you may also want to bring clothes to change into.
 Arrive on time (and in a clean car)! Expect that your date will still be preparing, so take some time to make small talk with her parents. When your date walks in, compliment her, then slip the corsage on her wrist.Make sure you pose for any pictures your date's parents want.
Thank her parents before leaving and make sure you're clear on what time your date is supposed to be back home.
 Pictures will either happen at your date’s house or, if you’re going with a group, at a friend’s house. Be cooperative and smile for all the pictures. And make sure you thank the host before leaving.When posing, place your arm behind the small of your date’s back and let your hand rest on her waist.
Take some goofy pictures too. This is a big milestone, so have fun with it.

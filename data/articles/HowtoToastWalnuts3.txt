 A microwave-safe pie dish works well, but any dish marked safe for microwave use will be adequate. Only add enough walnuts to cover the bottom of the dish in a single layer. Keep the walnuts in halves or quarters to ensure the best possible toast.
 Check the walnuts to make sure that none have burned. Stir them using a heat-resistant spatula to make sure that each nut is getting cooked evenly. If your microwave does not have a rotating tray, turn the dish 180 degrees before continuing.
 Smell them to see if they have finished cooking. If done in the microwave, walnuts will not brown, but the toasted smell should still come through.
 This will not usually be necessary after the first 2 minutes of cooking, but it might prove useful if the halves are especially large.
 Eating them directly out of the microwave could cause you to burn your mouth.

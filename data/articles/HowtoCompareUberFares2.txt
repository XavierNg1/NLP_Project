,, Some types of rides, such as Access rides, will have multiple options available above.
 The estimate is displayed as a range (i.e $27-36). You can expect your fare to generally be within this range, but it may end up more if you encounter bad traffic.
 In many cities you'll see the exact fare you'll be charged and will be able to confirm that you want to order your ride.

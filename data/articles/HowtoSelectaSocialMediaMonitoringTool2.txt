 The following are tools you can use to check how your social media is working.


Google Alerts are the most basic social monitoring tool. By going to Google.com and clicking on the "More" drop down menu, and the "Even More" option, you will find Google Alerts amongst the list of free Google tools. Sign up for alerts by putting in keywords that apply to your business, entering an email and choosing to get the alerts either daily or weekly. You can also enter a specific site, such as "site:yourwebsite.com" followed by your keywords, and the results will be restricted to that site.
Go to Social Mention. This free service allows you to create alerts as well. You can also download a widget that helps you to track analytic data on your website or blog.

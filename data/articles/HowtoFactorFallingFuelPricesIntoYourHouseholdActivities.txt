 All the things that you do when fuel prices skyrocket should continue as your regular habit. This is good for your budget, good for your health, and good for the environment. Most of all, it means you are continuing to shape the habit of less reliance on fuel. So, keep:
Leaving the car at home unless you really need to use it



 


Walking to the local stores, clubs, sports activities etc. that are within walking distance






Preferring public transportation over your own car use






Cycling to and from work, school, studies, activities

, You will know how much extra your fuel cost you during a rise in prices. Try to put that difference into the bank account. Of course, if you were barely making ends meet during a price rise, you will need to focus on bill payments and grocery shopping but try to put aside any savings possible. This will become a form of future-proofing against the next round of fuel price rises.
 Keep on the plan to reduce the amount of cars in your household and trading gas-guzzlers for smaller models, or even for a hybrid. Think long-term rather than about the short-term benefits of a dip in fuel prices.
 This will be the ultimate price-driver as new fuels are barely in testing mode and are totally inadequate at this stage to take the place of oil derived fuels.
 A dip in prices can mean a boost in research money for the future. Encourage friends, family, neighbors and communities to demand wider availability and usage of alternative fuels. It is important not to become complacent and feel seduced by lower fuel prices - we need to be planning now to improve the viability of alternative fuels.

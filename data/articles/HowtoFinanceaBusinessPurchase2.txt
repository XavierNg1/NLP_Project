 The easiest and cheapest way to finance your own business is with your own personal savings. This includes any savings accounts, CDs, investment accounts, or other liquid accounts you hold. By using the money from these accounts to finance your personal, you can avoid having to work with partners, investors, or lenders when running your business. However, it is rare that an individual has enough money in these accounts to purchase a business., Another way to raise money is to sell off valuable assets that you own. Parcels of land, non-essential vehicles, and boats can all be sold to raise this type of money.
 You can borrow against the value of your home using a second mortgage or a home equity line of credit (HELOC). However, this requires having enough equity in your home in the first place. More importantly, it also introduces the risk that, in the event of the business's default, your house may be foreclosed upon by the lender. Consider the risks and try every other options available to you before pursuing this type of financing., While it is possible to roll your IRA or 401(k) savings balances into a business venture without taking a tax hit, doing so is incredibly risky. If your business fails to perform as expected, you could lose all of the money you have saved for retirement. Personal finance experts recommend against using this as a method of business financing.

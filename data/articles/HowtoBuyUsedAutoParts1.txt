 Auto salvage yards often sell used auto parts for relatively low prices; however, in most cases, you will need to bring your own tools and remove the part from the car by yourself.


Consult with your local telephone directory or use the Internet to find auto salvage yards in your area. Examples of common search phrases you can enter into a search engine are "auto salvage yards," "junkyards," and "pick and pull auto.";
, Often, you can buy whole assemblies instead of individual parts; this will save money as well as time, as whole assemblies are usually cheaper than single parts.
 In most cases, auto salvage yards can quote you a price for the car part and inform you whether they have that particular part on hand.


Ask the salvage yard about any additional fees that may apply. Some auto salvage yards will require you to pay an additional fee to enter the salvage yard.
 Some salvage yards may honor returns and refunds on parts within a certain time period; whereas other salvage yards may stipulate that all sales are final.

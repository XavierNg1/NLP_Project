 Bring 10 herbs, 4 tranquilizers, 3 paintballs and a shock trap. You can have 2 shock traps when you are in the quest, and if you have an iron katana with no upgrade, you are good to go. But when it is upgraded you'll be able to kill that monster.;
, Do not place the shock trap yet if you are playing this on Monster Hunter 2; you can capture your monster anyway. Let's go to hunt the Khezu.
 Don't attack yet, because he will do the electric shock defensive course now. Attack it, but if he does the electric shock, get out of his way or you will catch his electricity.


If you are using a katana, that is good because you beat the Khezu with an iron katana. Make sure your katana is full tip always hit the Khezu in 1 side of it's leg now.
Always attack his 1 side leg. If he falls down, attack his head repeatedly. If he gets back up, hit his leg again.
If he is not moving or it's mouth is going blue or colored place the shock trap and attack it. If he doesn't get in the map 3, attack him again, but be be careful; it will give you more damage if you catch the shock now if he goes to map 3. Go there, I am sure the Khezu is sleeping there now.
If you are playing Monster Hunter Fu, place the shock trap and start attacking it and it will be dead for soon. But when you are playing Monster Hunter 2, place the shock trap in it's position. Then, in his paralysis, throw the tranquilizer to it, and it will fall asleep.

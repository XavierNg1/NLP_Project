 This breed is extremely social and friendly. Conversely, they can become miserable and destructive when confined alone to a backyard. Thus, it is important to give your Samoyed lots of attention.Samoyeds love to be around children and are excellent companion dogs.
If possible, install a dog door so that your Samoyed can go out when necessary but enter to share in family activities., As the dog gets older, it can become more stubborn. By establishing house rules while your Samoyed is young and letting him know you are in charge, you will be able to have a smooth relationship. If you don’t want your Samoyed on the bed as an adult, for example, do not allow it as a puppy.
A socialization class for your Samoyed puppy and you can teach you how to relate to each other and have an effective working relationship. You will learn to be a fair and consistent owner and will learn effective voice commands.
Your breeder or veterinarian can recommend a class, or you can look online at Websites such as that for the National Association of Dog Obedience Instructors., Since Samoyeds are pack-oriented, they will look for a leader or assume that role themselves. To establish your authority, do simple things, like be sure to go through a door first when accompanied by your puppy.Or, teach your dog to wait for your signal before he starts to eat.Another way to assert your role as the “alpha” dog is to make your Samoyed move out of your way when he is lying on the floor, rather than you walk around him.
Additionally, you can reinforce your role as the leader by not sharing your bed with your Samoyed.

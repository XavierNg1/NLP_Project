 Cloth purses are very casual fashion items, so colorful fabrics and whimsical patterns are the strongest trends. If you love bold colors and striking contrasts youâ€™ll have a great time shopping for cloth purses this season.
 A cloth purse is mostly a spring/summer fashion accessory, so expect to see warm colors, and light breezy cotton or nylon fabrics. Fresh, summery patterned fabrics with flowers, fruits and ladybugs are always popular.
 Know that the clever and practical reversible cloth purse is also very fashionable. You can literally turn the purse inside out to reveal the alternative fabric pattern, so you have two purses in one.
 A seatbelt bag is an eye-catching, conversation-starting, and very durable and stain-resistant kind of cloth purse. They come in various colors, combinations of colors, and sizes. The interwoven seatbelt material straps from which they are made reflect light differently depending on viewing angle, so they seem to shift from monotone to checkered to the reverse checkered pattern much like a pattern mowed sports field.

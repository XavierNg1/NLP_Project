 There, you can also purchase stamps and envelopes if you don't have any in hand. The letter mailbox is usually located near the PO boxes or next to the mail kiosk.
 In the US, they are blue, have a dome on top and have a USPS logo on the side. You will find them near/at major streets and office buildings.


Only place in a mailbox for a system you've paid the postage for. Don't use a commercial delivery mailbox if you don't have the right mailing label. If you've used regular stamps, use a box for your matching national mailing system.
 If you live near a subdivision that uses street mail boxes instead of individual house mailboxes, place the letter in the "Outgoing Mail" slot.


The outgoing mail slot is usually located on the right side above the package mailbox #2 (Usually identified as "2P").
You do not have to live in that subdivision to use the outgoing mailbox, as all the mail goes to the US post office system.
 Give the letter to a trusted friend and ask them to place it in their mailbox.

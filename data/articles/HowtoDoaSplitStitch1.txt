 Use an embroidery transfer pen to lightly trace the line you plan to embroider onto the fabric.


If you're only practicing the stitch and not following a pattern, you might find it easier to start practicing with straight lines.
Once you feel comfortable working with straight lines, draw some curved lines and shapes. The split stitch and split backstitch are both relatively easy to navigate around curves.
 Place your fabric in an embroidery hoop, centering the line you traced so that it falls in the middle of the hoop.


Place the fabric over the inner ring of the hoop.
Press the outer ring down, over the fabric and the inner ring.
Smooth out all the wrinkles and creases in your fabric.
Tighten the screw on your embroidery hoop. This should secure the fabric in place, making it ready for embroidery work.
 Insert the embroidery floss through the eye of your embroidery needle. Knot the tail end of the floss.


Choose six strand floss when you're starting out with the split stitch and split backstitch. You should be able to separate the floss evenly as you split each stitch, keeping three stitches on both sides of the needle.

 The mushrooms used in the recipe are yellow chanterelles.;
, Place the chopped pieces into a heavy fry pan (no oil).
 This will release the water from the mushrooms. Stir occasionally.
 Sprinkle with salt to help get the liquid out.


Liquid can be added to make soup or gravy.
 When the water has been reduced or removed, add a small amount of oil or butter and continue to cook over medium heat. This is optional but will improve the flavor.
 Cook about 5-10 minutes.
 You'll find that mushrooms cooked in this way are smaller, but of a fine texture and with a most wonderful flavor. They're great to add to pasta, an omelette or to eat any way you like!

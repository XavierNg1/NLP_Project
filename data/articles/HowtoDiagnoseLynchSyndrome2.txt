 If you think you are at risk for Lynch syndrome, you should visit your doctor, who will most likely refer you to see a specialist in genetics called a Medical Geneticist. They are experts in providing genetic testing, counseling, and management of genetic disease like lynch syndrome.


You should see your doctor if you experience any of the physical symptoms, or have a family history of colon or other related cancer.
 Lynch syndrome may be suspected if there is a family history of colon, endometrial, and other cancers, especially if those cancers showed up in younger family members. The diagnosis is determined by doing genetic testing.Your doctor may also ask about relatives with tumors of the stomach, small intestine, brain, kidney, liver, or ovaries, as the gene that is mutated in Lynch syndrome increases the risk for a number of different cancers.
Your doctor will probably ask about cancer in previous generations, especially if you have multigenerational cancer patients in your family.
 If you or a family member have tumors, the doctor can do testing on the tumor to see if you have Lynch syndrome. He can determine if certain proteins are in the tumors which indicate Lynch syndrome.If the tumor test proves positive, you may not have Lynch Syndrome. The mutations may develop just in the tumors or cancer cells. After a positive, your doctor can perform genetic tests to decide for sure if you have Lynch Syndrome.
If anyone in your family has had cancer in the last few years, the hospital may still have a tissue sample your doctor can test.
 Currently there are tests available for a number of the mutations that occur in Lynch syndrome. These tests screen for mutations in the the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and EPCAM genes.You can have your doctor send out your blood for testing, but you can also have your blood tested by a number of different labs.

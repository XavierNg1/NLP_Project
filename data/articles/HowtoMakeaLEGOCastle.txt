 If you do not have a LEGO baseplate, you can use a flat, strong surface, such as a table.;
, Make sure a front wall has an entrance large enough to let in LEGO horses and troops,at least eight or nine bricks high. Also add towers at the corners of each wall.
 also decide if you want a drawbridge, but be prepares to include a moat.
, Some large blue LEGO plates would do.
 A barbican (tower protecting the gate) Or some village buildings would work

, Soldiers, villagers, siege weaponry, trees etc. Be creative!

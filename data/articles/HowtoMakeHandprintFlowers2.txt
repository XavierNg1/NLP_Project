 Trace your or your child’s hand on a piece of plain white paper. Cut the hand out to use as a template. This cut out will not be used in the final project., Place the template on about 25 sheets of tissue paper. You can use one color of tissue or paper or many colors. Because tissue paper is very thin, you should be able to cut out most or all 25 handprints at once. Each handprint flower will use about 15 pieces of tissue paper, so you will need to cut more out later.Use regular scissors to cut out all pieces of tissue paper at once. Dull scissors made for children may not do the job.
 Separate the pieces of tissue paper. Lay about 15 pieces of the cut out handprints on top of each other. The arrangement does not matter because you’re going to roll the tissue paper around floral wire., Take a piece of floral wire and bend it in half. Place the folded piece of wire at the bottom of the tissue paper handprints. Use your fingers to roll the bottom of the handprint around the floral wire as if you were trying to wrap the wire. The fingers should be loose in order to resemble petals., Use floral tape to secure the tissue paper to the wire. Wrap the floral tape around the tissue paper as far down on the paper as possible. It’s okay if it doesn’t look very pretty. The tape won’t show once the flowers are put in a vase., Continue to cut out paper, wrap it around floral wire, and secure the flower with tape. Repeat this process until you have as many flowers as desired. You can use more or less tissue paper for each flower to make some flowers fuller or thinner than others. Put the flowers in a vase when you’re finished.

 Place the middle of the pashmina horizontally flat across the top of your head. Either knot the tails at the nape of your neck or just make an “x” with them. Either way, the tails of the pashmina should drape over your shoulders and fall forward onto your chest. If you’d like to go incognito or vintage, add a pair of sunglasses to your outfit., Fold your scarf up so that the fabric is a bit thicker and not very wide. Wrap the scarf along your hairline above your forehead and let the ends hang down your back. Then tie the scarf in a double-knot at the nape of your neck so that it will not slide off. Leave the ends trailing down your back, or sweep them forward over your shoulder to hang down your front.
 Open your scarf so that it is unfolded completely and the entire scarf is exposed. Wrap it around your back and around your shoulders, so that the ends hang loosely between your arms and your sides. If you want to secure the scarf, tuck the ends back behind you under your armpits and tie it in a double knot or pin it together in the front with a stylish broach., Unfold your pashmina entirely and place the open scarf around your shoulders, keeping one side longer than the other. Drape the longer side across the opposite shoulder so that it will be securely positioned.

 You can find decorative sew-on embellishments at any craft store. Pick a spot on your jeans to sew on a few pretty buttons, pearls, or sequins, or add a scattering all over. Focus on pockets, cuffs, or the fronts of the thighs.








If you wish to add any embellishments to the back of your jeans, take care not to position them in a way that will make sitting uncomfortable. For example, some flat sequins or gems on your back pockets are probably fine, but raised embellishments on the backs of your thighs might create discomfort.
 Most studs can be added to fabric by hand. Just push them through the fabric and fold down the points.If you prefer, you can use a bedazzler to mechanically add studs and gems to your jeans.









Add your studs in a pattern, focus on a pocket, or place them around hems or along seams.
You may wish to mark in the desired placement of your studs with a pencil or marker before you start studding.
 Use a specialized glue like Aleeneâ€™s Jewel-It or Beacon Gem-Tac to glue on gems and rhinestones. This technique works best with flat-backed gems. Use tweezers or a jewel-setting tool to help you grip and place the gems and avoid getting glue on your fingers.

 Prior to the mid-1980s, Artex was strengthened with asbestos. If your home dates back to that decade or earlier, you may need to test the Artex for asbestos before removing it.


Do not attempt to remove Artex that may contain asbestos. Doing so could be dangerous to your health and the health of those around you.
 If testing is necessary, you'll need to hire a professional, certified contractor to perform the test.


The contractor will close off the area and take a sample of the Artex. After testing that sample in a lab, he or she will let you know if it contains asbestos.
If the Artex does contain asbestos, you'll need to speak with a specialist about removal. Do not attempt to remove it yourself.
If the Artex does not contain asbestos, you should be able to safely remove it without professional help.

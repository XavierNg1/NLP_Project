 Sometimes telling the former bully how you felt growing up in high school and/or how you still feel can help you heal old wounds.


Be honest when expressing yourself to the bully. This might be your only chance to tell them exactly what you think. Let them know that what they said and did to you was hurtful and wrong.
If you choose to unburden yourself to the former bully, don’t expect them to care. While you might hope that the former bully will repent and ask forgiveness, they might be totally unreformed. You might hear them say that the events that made such an impact on you were “No big deal” or “A long time ago.”

, Be mature when talking to them. Don’t let your former bully’s bad behavior become a license for you to sink to their level. Don’t hurl insults their way, or criticize the way they dress. It might feel good in the moment, but you’ll be disappointed in yourself later.Control your nonverbal behavior, too.Don’t roll your eyes or make a mean face at the former bully.
 As hard as it may be, you should accept their apology gracefully.Accepting an apology, especially from someone who caused you significant emotional and/or physical pain, shows strength of character.


Do not accept insincere apologies. If the bully laughingly says “Sorry about that one time I broke your jaw and left you in the hospital for two weeks,” let the bully know that what they did was very wrong and that sort of apology isn’t good enough. Say, “I see you’re still the same. Too bad.” Walk away and don’t engage with them further.
 Do what’s right for you. Bid a polite farewell to friends and acquaintances and make your exit.


Hopefully your bully has matured enough not to physically confront you, but be aware that they might be just as immature now as they were back in high school, especially if alcohol is involved. If they try to get physical with you, don’t provoke them. Just get out of there and contact the authorities.

 It could be anything like being an actor or a doctor. Identify it and keep it in your heart.;
, For example, My dream is to be Christine in The Phantom of the Opera, so I am going to take opera lessons. See? I am TAKING ACTION! You can do the same! Like if your dream includes sports, practice, practice, practice! Or if it's being an artist, draw, draw, draw! It's simple!

, Because you don't want to train for years to become a doctor then realize that you really wanted to be a chef. That would not be good. Just imagine doing all the things you love the most. What makes you the happiest. That one that makes you smile most is your dream.
 You never know when a job opportunity could pop up! It could come at the most random of times! And when the time comes, I've got one word for ya... ACCEPT.
 This let's you study/train more and more.  In the end you'll be a pro! Even if you are in your 60's, you're never too old to find your dream.
 Not even your parents. If they try to, firmly, but calmly say "I don't appreciate you not believing in me and my dream. This is my passion and I can't let anyone take it away from me." Then walk away.
 Always try your best! I know it's a cliché but it's true!

 If you plan on having the French braid stop at the top knot, you will need two hair ties. If you want to extend the braid throughout the top knot, you will need three hair ties.
 Gather the hair at the top of your hair, about eye-level and up, and pull it into a clip. Gather the rest of your hair into a low bun, and clip it out of the let. Unclip the hair at the top of your head. This hair will now be going into your French braid., Instead of pulling the strands over each other, you pull them under.








You can braid your hair straight back, or at a slight curve following your hairline., Undo the clip holding the bottom part of your hair. Pull you hair up and into a hair ponytail. Hold your hair with the hand that has the elastics on it. Use your other hand to pull the elastic off your wrist and wrap it around the ponytail. Depending on the thickness of your hair, you will need to wrap the elastic two to three times.









You should make the ponytail even if you plan on extending the braid into the top knot. This will make it easier to form the top knot itself.
 This is not completely necessary, but it can give you a cool look. Divide your ponytail into three sections, then braid them. Tie the end of your braid with another hair tie. If you have very thin hair, you may need to use a smaller hair tie.
 Twist your hair until it starts to coil on itself. Wrap it around the base of your ponytail, then hold it steady with the hand that has the elastic on it. Use your other hand to wrap the last and final elastic around the base of the top knot.
 Tuck the end of your hair under the top knot. Secure the top knot to your hair with hair pins or bobby pins. Be sure to use a color that matches your hair.

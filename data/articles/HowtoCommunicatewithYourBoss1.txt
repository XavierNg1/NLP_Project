 Use this as an opportunity to ask about where your job fits in the larger scheme of the company, how your job performance is going to be measured, and whether your boss expects your job responsibilities to change over time.Agree on your job responsibilities and establish expectations and common objectives. Ask open-ended questions like: “How do you see my job responsibilities shifting over time?” or “How does my role fit in with the larger structure of the company?”;
, Ask your boss whether they prefer you contact them via email, phone, in person, or a mixture of any of the above for everyday conversations or updates. Inquire about whether they would prefer to communicate differently in the case of a work “emergency,” and clarify what would count as such an emergency. This could range from you not being able to meet a deadline to you being sick and not being able to come into the office on a given day.


Perhaps your boss prefers you email them if you have a brief question but set up a meeting if you’d like to discuss a project idea or a larger goal. Whatever the case, be flexible and adapt to their communication style.
 Some supervisors will like a daily update, whereas others will prefer an update at the end of each week or even bi-monthly. Follow your boss’ guidance and update them as they have stated they would prefer.


You could bring this up by asking: “I can update you on a daily, weekly, or bi-monthly basis. What would work best for you?”

, Once you have gotten settled into the routine of your job, it’s wise to ask for feedback every so often. This could take the form of a quick monthly meeting. Your boss may be juggling many responsibilities, but they will likely be willing to take a few minutes out of their busy schedule to inform you on how they view your progress.

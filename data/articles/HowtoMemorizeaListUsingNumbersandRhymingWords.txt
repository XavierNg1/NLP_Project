, The more unusual and strange the objects are, the better it is for you to remember it.
 For instance, pretend that you are trying to memorize the following things: cup, rice, turkey, grass, pencil, sad, computer, guitar, needle, rabbit. Now take each item and associate them with each number item so that you picture in your mind: one is a bun - a cup between 2 buns; two is a shoe - a shoe filled with grains of rice; three is a tree - a turkey sitting on a tree; four is a door - a door covered with grass; five is a hive - a pencil sticking out of a beehive; six bricks - a bunch of sad-faced bricks; seven is heaven - a computer sitting on a mass of clouds in front of the golden gate of heaven; eight is a plate - a guitar sitting on top of a plate; nine a glass of wine - needles in a glass of wine (ouch!); ten is a pen - a rabbit writing something with a pen in his hand.
 For example, (if you follow the example shown in this so far) think of the number three: three is a tree. What is sitting on that tree? Check back to see if you got it right. Does it work? I hope so, it sure does work for me!

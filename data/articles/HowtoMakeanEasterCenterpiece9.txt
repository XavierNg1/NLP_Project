 Make an Easter tree. When making it, choose to either leave it natural (the original wood) or to paint it white or a pastel color that fits with the table setting theme. Attach Easter themed decorations to the tree and place in a sturdy container that will hold up the Easter tree easily. Place in the middle of the table.


Make a deluxe Easter tree centerpiece. Decorate this tree to the nth degree, with bunnies, chicks and eggs. Tie these decorations with ribbon so that they dangle down toward the table, as with a Christmas tree.
Make a minimalist Easter tree centerpiece. Use small branches and keep them natural. Add only a few key decorative objects to the tree.
Long strands of blossom can make a decorative Easter tree centerpiece. Snip long lengths from the tree, add Easter decorations and place in the container.

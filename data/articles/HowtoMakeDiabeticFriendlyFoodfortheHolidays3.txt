 Put the rutabagas, carrots, garlic, herbs and water into a large pot and stir everything around to combine. Then cover the pot with a lid and turn the heat to medium-high.You can use a different herb or spice combination if you prefer. For example, you could try using ½ teaspoon of nutmeg instead of the bay leaf and thyme.You could also use a crockpot for this recipe if you want to prep everything a few hours ahead of time. Put everything in a crock pot and turn it to the high setting. Allow the veggies to cook on high for about 3 hours or until they are tender.
 After the water comes to a boil, turn the heat down to medium-low and allow the veggies to simmer for about 30 minutes or until they are all tender. Keep the lid on while the veggies are cooking., When the veggies are finished cooking, drain the water from the pot using a colander. Then, return the veggies to the pot.Make sure that you keep about ½ cup of the liquid and set it aside.
 Use a potato mashed to mash the veggies. This will also combine the carrots and rutabagas. After the veggies are well mashed, add the reserved liquid and 1 tablespoon of olive oil and stir everything together well.You can also use an immersion blender, food processor, or just a regular blender to make your rutabaga and carrot mash into a puree.However, if you like some texture to your mash, then a potato masher works best.

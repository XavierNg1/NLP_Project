 Exercising efficiently makes you stronger, but also clears your mind. this is a relaxation technique to help any stress or anger you have. However, the stronger your body, the more ignited it will be when you become berserk.;
, Monks call it chi. Berserk called it spiritual animalism. Having something that makes you invoke yourself towards igniting your rage is a key element, but not the main key element to berserking. You have to believe in yourself into making it a power within you a secret ability like a video game character; a power that you can use.
 This depends on many people. Working yourself up into this frenzy is an art and should be practiced if you want to achieve its true power. Think of things that make you angry, people who hurt you, things that annoyed you, things you could never beat a long time ago, such as being alone. Anything that will help trigger this. For some, it's instant for others, it's a build up.
 Entering this rage is one thing, but learning when to shut it off is another thing. This also takes practice and should be practiced more than entering it itself. Try to relax. Extinguish it with breathing or calm images in your mind, letting your body go loose and not tense up.
 Meditating will help you know your surroundings and increase your focus on things. This will help a lot if you are really wanting to focus your power into this.

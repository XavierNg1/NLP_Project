 Outdoor lunges are not only a great way to get some fresh air, but can also prepare you for the real-world conditions you might face. If your lunges are a way to prepare for climbing or cross country, you would benefit from practicing your lunges on terrain that resembles the terrain you will spend most of your time on. Find a semi-empty nature trail or hilly area where you can practice., You could lunge with hand weights or ankle weights. Choose a weight level that is appropriate for your body type and strength level. Start slowly by adding just one pound in each hand or on each ankle, then adding weight slowly to each limb in half-pound increments. When 8 to 12 reps produces a significant strain, youâ€™re at your maximum weighted lunge limit.Free weights, dumbbells, and ankle weights are available at most fitness and sporting goods stores.
 Depending on how deep your lunge was to start with, you might not have much room to deepen your lunge. If you do, though, you can strengthen your butt or improve your range of motion. Just make sure that you do not extend your front knee beyond the tips of your toes. Keep your shin vertical.

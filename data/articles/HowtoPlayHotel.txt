 These will be your hotel rooms. Make sure your family doesn't mind you using them. Once you've found several, make a small bed in each room if there isn't already one, using pillows and/or sleeping bags. Also, provide blankets, towels, treats, and goodies.;
, Create numbers on each key, and hang them on the door. Construct a front desk, and make do not disturb signs

, You could also include your family members, as well as siblings. If you have a pet, use him/her as a door animal.
 Use other rooms, and have room service to have some fun in life. Take turns when it comes to managing the hotel, and avoid creating any messes.
 You can do this by using a piece of paper or a notebook.
 You could also have one of your friends pretend to be the maid, but make sure you don't boss everyone around.
 Basically, this is when your "guests" will have their meals. Ask everyone when they normally have dinner, for example. Then, set the dinner time according to everyone's response.

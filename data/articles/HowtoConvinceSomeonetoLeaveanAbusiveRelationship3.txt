 Reaching the point where your loved one is ready to leave may take longer than you want it to. Let them move at their own pace without pressure. Work on taking care of yourself and being supportive.
 They may be facing many difficult and confusing emotions. Spend time with them, allowing them to vent and work through everything.


If you're unsure, ask "Are you looking for advice, or do you just want to vent?"

, Abuse stirs up many emotions, not all of which may make sense to you or seem "right." You don't have to understand. Many times, when people talk, they just want to feel that you care. Here are some useful, validating phrases to practice:


"That sounds really difficult/frustrating/rough."
"I see."
"I"m so sorry to hear that."
"I'm not surprised to hear that you feel that way, given everything you're going through."

, They may feel that it's their fault, that they're being ridiculous or irrational, or that they deserve to be abused. Remind them that their feelings are normal and it isn't their fault.
 Your loved one is experiencing pain that you cannot understand, and it is belittling to tell them what to do or how to feel. You don't want them to transition from obeying an abuser to obeying youâ€”you want them to gain the autonomy to choose for themselves.


"You need to leave them" or "You should get help" are examples of telling them what to do/feel.
 Your loved one isn't being treated well, and they might forget that they deserve good treatment. You can help by respecting them and their autonomy, and treating them the way they deserve to be treated. Your kindness will gently remind them that they are worth more.
 Even after the relationship is over, abuse leaves long-lasting effects. Continue being there for your loved one and helping them face their scars.

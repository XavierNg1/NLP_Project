 Figure on at least two hours past the time you normally go to sleep.;
, You'll be tired from staying up late, but resist the temptation to sleep in. That will only make it harder come nighttime!

, Do your parents need help cleaning the house? Do you need to take a walk to get away from your excited kids? Do you need anything at the store? Offer to run any errands anyone needs done, do as many household chores as you can, and entertain any small children.
 Exercise will help you sleep later, but if you do it too close to bedtime it will wake you up more.
 That means soda, coffee, cookies, cakes, and sweets.
 It's tempting to sit in the dark and watch Christmas films, and many people believe it helps them to fall asleep. But the truth is they're stimulants. Either may eventually help you relax, but if the tv or computer are on, you'll end up staying awake much longer than you would without them.
 Use calming scents, nothing citrus. Take as long as you like, or at least as long as you can if your family objects.
 You can always change in the morning, right now comfort should be your top priority.
 Though a steamer does have sugar in it, it shouldn't be enough to keep you awake. Don't have hot chocolate or coffee or tea - even decaf.
, If you're a student, textbooks will work great for this as long as you don't count it as actual study time. Fiction is often more fun, but it will stimulate you just like the tv or computer would, and you'll stay up longer.
 After about 15 minutes or when your eyelids start to droop, turn out the light, set the book aside, and lie down. Breathe slowly and deeply, and count backwards from 100, going only one number for each breath.
 It's hard but try your best not to think about Christmas. Remember your favorite vacation, or how much fun you had with friends last week, or simply imagine yourself somewhere you love.

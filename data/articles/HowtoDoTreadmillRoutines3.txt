 Grab 2 to 5 lb. (0.9 to 2.3 kg) hand weights and place them at the front of your treadmill. This routine combines cardio exercise with weight training.
 Focus on tightening your core muscles, such as your back, abs and obliques. Lift your chest up slightly and make sure your earlobes to your hips form a straight line.
 Begin by slowly completing bicep curls for 1 minute. Slowly raise and lower the weight, focusing on form as you walk, and then place the weights on the front of the treadmill and rest for 2 minutes.
 Raise your hands straight above your shoulders with your hands up. Do the exercise for 1 minute and rest for 2 minutes.
 Swing your arms from back to front. Alternate 1 hand swinging forward while the other is swinging back, as if you are exaggerating your natural walking motion.
 Repeat the exercises twice during the exercise routine. Cool down with a 5 minute walk between 2.8 and 4 without weights.


Take advantage of your own treadmill's exercise routines. If you have pre-programmed routines, experiment with hills, intervals, fat-burning and endurance programs. Most are programmed according to resistance levels. You should alternate routines in order to find out what you prefer and to work more muscles.

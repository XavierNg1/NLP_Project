 For example: (Free Nintendo DS emulator) I used Nintendo Ds. Emulators are programs that translate code from a game platform to your computer.;
, Like Nintendogs or Mario Karts or sonic or whatever.
 Go to File>Open> and find your game. The extension might be something like mariokart.gba for Game boy advance and so on.
 You could look in a help file or set the controls yourself.

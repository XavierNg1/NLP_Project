 First trim off the tops. Then clean the roots under running water to remove any dirt. Next, cook them in water in either one of two ways:In the oven: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (191 degrees Celsius). Place the beats in an oven-safe dish. Add about ¼-inch of water. Place the dish in the oven and bake for 35 minutes or until the beets are tender enough for a knife or fork to puncture them without any effort.
On the stovetop: Place the beets in a saucepan. Cover them with water. Bring the water to a boil and then lower to simmer. Cook for 30 minutes or until they are soft enough for your fork or knife to poke through them with zero effort.;
, Transfer the beets to a strainer in the sink or a dry bowl in the fridge. Let them sit until they are cool enough to handle with your bare hands. While they cool, chop your garlic. Once the beets have cooled off, peel off the skins and cut them into small cubes.The size of the cubes doesn’t really matter, but the smaller the cube, the faster it generally takes to blend them.
 Add the beets and garlic to a blender or food processor. Then add the tahini paste, lemon juice, ground cumin, lemon zest, salt, and pepper. Pulse them until they combine into a creamy smooth texture. Take a taste test and add more seasonings if desired., Once it’s made, dig right in if you can't wait and use it as a dip for pita bread, crackers, or vegetables. Otherwise, store in an airtight container, refrigerate, and use within the next three days. If you don’t expect to use it all in that time, store it in the freezer instead.

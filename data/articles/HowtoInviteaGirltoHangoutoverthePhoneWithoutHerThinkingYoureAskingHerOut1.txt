 As a general rule, don’t call when she could be asleep. Avoid the hours of 9pm to 9am. Dates and hook-ups generally occur in the evening, so staying out of that time frame puts your conversation in more of a friend zone., Spend a maximum of ten minutes on the phone. Time is an investment and if you spend too much of it on a new friend they may get the impression that they mean something more to you.It may help to make this first phone call on the way to somewhere else. Then, you could end the call by saying, “Okay, I’ve got to go I just arrived at the gym. See you on Monday.”

, Suggest meeting up for a everyday event at a place that is not exclusive and laidback in atmosphere. You want to go for the opposite of a first date setting, especially for your initial time hanging out.If you want her to come over to your place and hang out, maybe say, "Hey! My girlfriend hates football and I'm about to watch the game, want to hang out? I hate to cheer alone."
If a girl offers to drop everything and free up her schedule, don't accept as this is a potentially romantic gesture on her part. You might respond, “I know that you are super busy and I am too. Let’s just hang out in an off time.”, If you are going to a movie, tell her that you will meet her inside the theatre. This makes it necessary for you each to buy your own ticket. Paying for her or her paying for you creates additional investment in the relationship that you may not want or be ready for.However, if you were already going to order a pizza and she comes over, don't worry if she doesn't chip in.
 Meet up at your hang out location and do not offer to pick her up unless absolutely necessary. Staying platonic comes down to keeping boundaries clearly drawn and maintained.

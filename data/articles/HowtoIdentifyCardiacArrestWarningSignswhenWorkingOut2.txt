 This evaluation is done to identify any conditions that may predispose you to injury or illness and clear you for safe participation in sports. The evaluation will include questions about any symptoms and your family history as well as check for a heart murmur or symptoms of Marfan syndrome (an inherited condition that may lead to heart problems).You should have a PPE before engaging in a sport or exercise. Clearance to participate will depend on the results of the evaluation and may also depend on the type of sport or even the position you play.
Keep in mind sudden cardiac arrest is very rare among young athletes and is more common in middle-age., If someone in your family had early onset heart disease, experienced cardiac arrest, or suffered from another heart condition, you are at greater risk of experiencing cardiac arrest. If you are unsure of your family’s history, ask relatives about your family’s health. For instance, you might ask a family member, “Did anyone in our family have any heart conditions?”Your doctor will ask you about your family history during your appointment regarding your potential cardiac arrest symptoms.
 There are many medical conditions that are closely correlated with cardiac arrest. For instance, if you have diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), or high blood cholesterol, you’re at elevated risk for cardiac arrest.Additionally, if you have had a heart attack or a previous episode of cardiac arrest, you are at elevated risk of experiencing cardiac arrest.
Other heart conditions like cardiomyopathy (a type of inherited heart disease), arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat), and congenital heart defects also increase your odds for cardiac arrest.
 Apart from inherited conditions, lifestyle-related health complications — obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, use of illegal drugs, and drinking excessively (more than one to two drinks per day) — also make you more likely to experience cardiac arrest when working out.

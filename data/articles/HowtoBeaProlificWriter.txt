 Once you establish a daily routine, it's hard to break. It becomes automatic, like your first cup of coffee in the morning. Once you get used to a daily session, it feels wrong to skip it.;
, Some writers call it "shutting off the internal editor." This allows you the freedom to produce page after page of words without evaluating them immediately. You'll have plenty of time for that later. Once you're written enough and time has passed, you'll be a better judge of your work.
 You may be working on a novel or memoir, but if you feel like writing a haiku, go for it. Once you've started pen to paper or fingers to keyboard, your mind may take you on a different road that is productive for your book or other project.
 Like sunlight? Sit by a window. Need company? Write in a coffeehouse. Must have absolute quiet? Turn off the phone and shut the door.
 Word counts are the typical gauge writers use to determine productivity. For you, it might be the number of pages you write per session or the number of lines in your notebook. Choose a way to keep track and chart your progress. In a few weeks, looking back on your output levels will strengthen your resolve to continue.
 Writers are human. You are human. Expect that your schedule will take unproductive turns because of life's curve balls. If you develop a well-established routine, it will be easier to return to it when the ups-and-downs even out.

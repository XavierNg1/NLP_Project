Panic attacks are one-time occurrences of feeling a sudden surge of overwhelming fear and anxiety.
Panic disorder is a series of panic attacks and a constant fear of suffering from future panic attacks.



Physical signs and symptoms include difficulty breathing, dizziness, trembling, heart or chest pain, nausea, sweating, tingling or numbness in toes and fingers, chills or hot flashes, an increased heart rate, headache, abdominal cramping and trouble swallowing.
A panic attack lasts anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes, but rarely lasts longer than an hour.

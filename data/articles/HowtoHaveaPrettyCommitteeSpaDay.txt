 The number should be around 5 people. Even though it's exclusive, others should know about the Spa. Also, you actually need a spa at your house. If you don't, you will need a very large bathroom.;
, So, buy cheap swim suits and hand them out to your cliques. Something simple like black will do.
 If you have money, choose something such as Pantene or Bumble & Bumble. Make sure that they're clean; or you could buy smaller bottles.
 Brands such Philosophy and Dove have great scents that your clique will love. And make sure you have body scrubs!

, In the first chapter of "My Little Phony," the girls (except for Claire) have a hot rock massage. It's easy to prepare, and relaxing!

, The clique members have awesome nails (except for Claire). Get different colours and help each other paint each other's nails. Or, if you have a lot of money like Massie, call in someone to do it for all of you.
 If you don't have it, then oh well.
 Have nice smelling lotion / moisturizer.

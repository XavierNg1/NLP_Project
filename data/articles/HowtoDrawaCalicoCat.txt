 This will be the head.;
, This will be the body. You do not want to make it too big because then the cat will look really fat.
 Make two more vertical lines near the back of the body. These will be the legs. Next these two legs, you want to draw one line near each one of the legs. These are the other legs.
 These are the cat's paws. Draw five lines from the bottom of the paw to the middle and some very, very small curved downward triangles for the claws. If you want the claws out, draw the curved triangles.
 Draw another line a little bit from the other line. Make sure that this line is curved so that its tip will match the tip of the other line. This is the tail.
, Make points at the edges of the circle and in the middle to make the nose.
 Draw small circles inside them. They are the eyes.
 Do not do it at the chin, but a a little bit more than just about above the chin.
 Do not make it very big. Repeat on the other side of the line. You now have the mouth!

,, Make the whiskers quick, light strokes.
 This will be the fur.
 Remember that a calico cat is mostly white. Add orange and black splotches on the cat's body, tail, legs, and every where you don't add fur marks. The eyes can be amber, yellow, blue, or green, but calico cats are most common to having amber eyes. Amber is a yellow brown color.

 You cannot machine wash or hand wash suede slippers by submerging them. If you spill something on the suede, use a clean towel to blot and wipe at the spill.If the suede is waterproof, then you can use a damp towel to wipe at the spill. If not, stick with a dry towel., If the spill can stain the suede and you know the towel treatment alone will not suffice, then use a suede cleaning kit on the exterior.A suede cleaning kit will come with a stain eraser and a small, stiff suede brush with which to work in the eraser.A suede brush, nail file, or soft-textured sandpaper can also remove mud or scuff marks. This will also return the nap texture to the suede.Once the exterior of the slippers is clean, consider applying a suede-safe waterproofing spray to make cleaning them easier in the future., Baby wipes allow you to scrub out the slippers without wetting the suede. This works for both cotton and fleece-lined interiors.Baby wipes are low in moisture and have a mild detergent.Use a couple of them to work the inside of the slippers until you stop seeing the grime staining them.


You can alternatively dampen a washcloth and dab just a drop or two of wool detergent or another mild soap such as baby shampoo on the washcloth before using it to scrub the soft insides of the slippers., Once cleaned out, use a clean, damp washcloth to wipe out the insides. Remove any leftover detergent. Baby wipes are mild enough that this might not be necessary, but it will be if you use the couple drops of wool detergent or baby shampoo., You do not want to apply heat to suede slippers, so youâ€™ll simply have to give them plenty of time to air dry before you wear them again. Wads of newspaper are actually a great way to absorb moisture without using heat, so you can stuff the insides with balled up newspaper to help dry them out more quickly.

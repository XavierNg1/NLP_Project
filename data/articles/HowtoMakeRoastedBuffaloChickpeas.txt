 Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Then line a baking sheet with parchment paper or waxed paper.


Open the can of chickpeas, drain and rinse. Pat chickpeas with a paper towel to dry.
Spread chickpeas across the baking sheet (avoid piling them on top of each other--your baking sheet should be evenly covered).;
, Melt the butter either in a saucepan over low heat on the stove or in the microwave for about 15 to 30 seconds (depending upon your microwave strength).


Pour butter into a small bowl and add hot sauce. Whisk well.
 Pour slowly in order to reach each chickpea. Once youâ€™ve hit all the tops, stir the chickpeas and then re-spread onto baking sheet.


Add more sauce until all chickpeas are sufficiently covered.

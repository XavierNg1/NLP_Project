 When there is no outside agency to supervise and no exams to answer, it is easy to get sidetracked.;
, Apply your parental discretion and come up with a timetable.
 What this means is that once lessons have been taught, the child should be asked to do some part of the course work by himself without your guidance. You will need to make sure that your child sits willingly and finishes his or her work.
, The child should be expected to reach his desk at the appointed time, in proper attire with all the necessary material. It is easy to allow the school to become an extension of play if these ground rules are not laid out and followed. As the teacher, supervisor, principal and janitor rolled into one, you should also approach the study area with a cool professionalism.
 In spite of all the precautions and steps one takes, it is easy for a child to get familiar at homeschool. At such times, it may be difficult to discipline the child and get him to listen to you attentively.
 Allow the child to take a breather and enjoy a break yourself.

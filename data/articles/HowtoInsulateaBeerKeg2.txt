 If you don't want to spend the money on a specialized keg cozy, you can improvise a similar setup. Begin by gathering a few thick towels, blankets, or other warm, thick fabrics. A roll of bubble wrap also works well when wrapped in several layers. Doubly so when wrapped over an ice jacket.
 Wrap the fabrics you've chosen as generously as desired around the outside of the keg. The more fabric you place around the outside of the keg, the longer the beer will remain chilled.
 If the beer keg will not be moved much during use, you can probably simply tuck the fabrics into each other to keep them in place. Otherwise, you can try taping them in place using packing tape or duct tape. Another option is placing the entire wrapped keg into another container, such as a large trash can.

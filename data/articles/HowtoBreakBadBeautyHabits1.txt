 You use your hands every day, touching all sorts of things. Whatever you touch is spread to your face, so be sure that you wash your hands whenever necessary.

, The drying saliva ultimately causes chapped lips. Lip balm and regular water consumption will remedy chapped lips.


To stop your lips from peeling and cracking for good, spread a thick layer of petroleum jelly on your lips every night before you go to bed (Vaseline is a good choice). This is really helpful (especially for those who sleep with the air-conditioning on at night) as petroleum jelly locks in the moisture that's in your lips and keeps your lips from drying out.
You can also exfoliate your lips. Rub fine sugar on your lips in gentle, circular motions once a week. Leave it on for about two minutes, and then wash it off. It's best to do this at night right before you apply the petroleum jelly.

 Pimples are clogged pores filled with bacteria, so touching them will irritate your skin and may scar your face.


Over-the-counter products could work, but the best way to clear pimples without the synthetics is to dab a small amount of tea tree oil over the pimple once every day. This can greatly reduce inflammation; thus, making the pimple less noticeable.
If you habitually sleep in cold temperatures, turn down the temperature a few notches every day, or until you get used to the accruing temperatures. If you still need the cold, remember to slap on body lotion every night and wear socks on your feet every other day before sleeping.

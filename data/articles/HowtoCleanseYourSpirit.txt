 This can be inside, outside, or anywhere that is your happy place. It should speak to you. It can be an elaborate alter or just a small place outside where you can light a candle.;
, Sage is really important. Also, matches to light everything. Bring a blanket to sit on if you are outside.
 Begin to quiet your mind and ask your deity to listen and help cleanse your spirit.
 Where are you carrying tension? Is your heart heavy?

, What is troubling you? What is going on in your life that is hurting your spirit? Examples of this could be negative people, a traumatic experience or just a bunch of stress. Whatever this is, concentrate on the feelings. Really feel these emotions. This can be uncomfortable.
 While you concentrate on these feelings begin to imagine that they are slowly seeping from your head to the egg. Really concentrate and put all of your negative emotions into the egg. Make sure all of them are placed into the egg.
 This is very satisfying.
 Wave it around and really get it into the air. Make sure you get it around your head and heart area. Once you are done, put the sage out.
 Relax your whole body. Start from your tippy toes and concentrate on one body part at a time. Don't forget small body parts like your jaw and your finger tips. Pretend like your body is sinking into the floor in deep relaxation.
 Quiet your mind. Just lay there in your happy place. Pretend that your body is melting into the ground. There is no tension. Your body should feel like butter!

, If you do not believe in a god, that is OK. Ask for a blessing from the divine and for your soul to become less burdened.
 Feel how much lighter you feel.

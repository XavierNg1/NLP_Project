,, Ions of 235U leave trails that curve differently than those of 238U. These ions can be isolated to enrich uranium.


This method was used to process uranium for the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 and was also the enrichment method Iraq used in its nuclear weapons program of 1992. It requires 10 times more energy than gaseous diffusion, making it impractical for large-scale enrichment programs.

 You may use any old school or work tops and skirts, however note that you probably shouldn't use something you need. Try to borrow things rather than buy them. As this is an outfit for one night only, probably, make your maximum spending limit a small amount, $8 / Â£5.;
, Apply fake blood to an old blouse if you want your costume to resemble a school girl who died in a gory way. You could, alternatively, apply a little dirt or dust to imitate a reanimated corpse of a school girl who did not die violently.
 A (short) black, blue or grey skirt would be fine. You can wear a longer skirt if you prefer. Apply blood to your skirt too, it may not show. If you prefer the reanimated corpse look, glue fake worms to your costume.
 White knee high socks (not compulsory) which may be sprayed with blood. Pair this with black school shoes and a school tie for your shirt. The tie does not need to be neat, it is better scruffy and optionally blood sprayed too!

, It will look even cooler if you cut or rip the edges of your clothes. Remember though, October is very chilly (especially in Britain) and if you are going in a neighbourhood of young children, nothing too short or revealing - or scary for that matter too.

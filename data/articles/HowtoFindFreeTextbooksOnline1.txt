 It may sound complicated, but it's really not bad, don't be scared! You can either search on a torrent website or use a search engine that checks multiple torrent websites.;
, Torrent search engines aren't great. If you search for "third edition", a result with the word "3E" might not show up, for example. So search for words that would be in the result. For example, if you're looking for Introduction to Electrodynamics by David Griffiths, search for "Electrodynamics Griffiths". If this gives too many results, add 1-2 keywords at a time to thin out until you find what you need.
 On Google, there is more freedom for different wordings of the same thing. You may be directed to torrent sites you may never thought of, and they could be the only one with your book!

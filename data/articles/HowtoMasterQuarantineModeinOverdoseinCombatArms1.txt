 This is extremely vital, because zombies are faster than humans, if you don't know where you are going, you can easily get infected. Moreover, there are two "safe rooms" when the humans need to survive for another minute (explained later). You need to know those places as well as potential hiding places. Unlike Death Room, the map is very complicated, so you are going to have to play over this map several times in order to get the "feel" of how this mode works.
 Since two of the places are going to be grouped by humans, it is somewhat likely that one of them is going to appear as zombies and then they can infect everyone around him.

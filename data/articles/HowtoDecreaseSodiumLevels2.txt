Opt for versions of these products that are "low sodium or "reduced sodium"., Canned foods like beans and vegetables contain a large amount of sodium. Pour the contents of the can into a strainer to drain the liquid and rinse these canned side dishes before cooking them. Taking the time to wash the vegetables and legumes will cut the salt by up to 40%., If you are shopping for a particular item, read the nutritional information for various brands. Compare sodium levels and opt for the product with the lowest salt content. Make it a habit to do this whenever you are out grocery shopping., If you do not find the low sodium version of your favorite foods palatable, try mixing the salted and unsalted versions to lower the overall sodium content. For instance, purchase a low sodium soup and mix it with the regular, full-salt version. This combination will dilute the salt, and help you ease into a lowed sodium diet more comfortably.

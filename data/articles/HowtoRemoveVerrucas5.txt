 Verrucas are most commonly passed from person to person at the swimming pool, therefore it is important to cover your verruca with a waterproof plaster when you go swimming. Alternatively, you can buy special swim socks at the pharmacy.


You can cover the verruca in nail polish varnish, which creates a seal that prevents you from passing the virus on to other people., Verrucas can spread through the sharing of towels, socks, and shoes, so if you have a verruca, do not share these items with others. At the gym or local pool, you should bring and use your own equipment.
 Similarly to swimming pools, verrucas can easily be passed from person to person in communal showers. You should wear flip-flops when using public showers., The HPV virus that causes warts is incredibly contagious, so you should keep the verruca covered and avoid touching other's warts., The gym is the most common place to get verrucas for adults, but they can be easily prevented using the wipes found near the equipment. Be sure to wipe down anything you use after you're done, and consider getting some lifting gloves if you are worried about spreading verrucas.

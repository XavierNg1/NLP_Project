 For this battery, you’ll need one copper plate and one aluminum plate -- both roughly the size of your hands. You’ll also need two electrical lead wires with alligator clips at both ends, and you’ll need a voltage meter.


You can purchase the metal plates, wires, and voltage meter at a hardware store.
 If you don't have a piece of wood, you can also place the plates on another non-metallic surface — for example, plastic.
 Using the alligator clips, connect the copper sheet to one end of the voltage meter, and the aluminum sheet to the other end of the voltage meter.


If you’re unsure of how to connect items to your specific voltage meter, check its instruction manual.
 When you place your hands on the metal plates, the sweat on your hands should react with the metal plates to produce a reading on the voltage meter.


If the meter doesn’t show a reading, reverse your connections: attach the copper plate to the terminal that the aluminum plate was connected to, and vice versa.
If you still struggle to get a reading, check the connection and wiring. If everything is working well, it could be that the plates are oxidized. To remove oxidization, clean the plates with a pencil eraser or steel wool.

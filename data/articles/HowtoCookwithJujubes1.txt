 Unless you live in an area where jujubes are plentiful, you may have a hard time finding them in your local supermarket. You will have better luck at a farmers' market or a well-stocked health food store. Asian and Indian markets also tend to carry them., There are lots of different varieties of jujubes. In general, however, they will be round or oval-shaped and about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) long. Young jujubes are light green. As they ripen, they will turn yellow. Sometimes, reddish-brown spots may appear on the skin. Once fully ripe, jujubes will be reddish-brown in color, soft, and wrinkly.

If you plan on eating jujubes fresh, buy them just before they turn red, soft, and wrinkly., Jujubes can last a long time, especially once they are dried. Whether you have fresh or dried jujubes, you should store them in the fridge in an airtight container.

 You will need to start introducing the new food gradually. To start, feed the dog a mixture of old food and new food with a ratio of 75% old to 25% new. For example, if your dog needs two cups of kibble, you should feed them one and a half cups of the old food and half a cup of the new food. Continue this for between one and three days.If you are switching the dog from dry to wet food, you can simply stir the wet food into the bowl with the dry food., If three days have passed without problem, you can increase the amount of new food that you feed the dog. Mix equal amounts of the old food and the new food together. For example, if the dog is eating two cups of kibble, mix one cup of the old food and one cup of the new food. This period should last for up to three days., If the dog is still eating the new food without problem, you can start feeding even more of the new food. At this point, the dog should be eating meals that are 75% new food and 25% old food. For example, one and a half cups of new food should be mixed with half a cup of old food. This period should last for up to another three days., If the dog has not experienced any trouble with the new food, you can stop feeding the dog their old food entirely. This typically happens at around day ten of the transition.

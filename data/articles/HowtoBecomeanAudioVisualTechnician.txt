High school audio visual clubs and community access television programs are frequent starting points for a career as an audio visual technician.
Other opportunities include school or community theater productions.



While technical skills are essential in the field, audio visual technicians work with a variety of clients, often under deadline pressure. You may need to work with someone you have never met when you encounter a technical crisis, agenda change or equipment failure during a live event. The ability to do so with equanimity and confidence gives the customers--and your coworkers--an increased sense of security.
You may also need to advise clients unfamiliar with technology on the best equipment for their needs or train clients to use equipment.



A bachelor's degree or an associate degree in communications, broadcast technology or a related field is required by some corporations employing audio visual technicians. Training for entry-level positions is also available through trade schools and professional group certification programs.



Specializing in an area such as projection technology, system design or installation can bring a higher salary and help you to advance to a senior or managerial position.

 If a stain has set, your first course of action should be to try cool water and mild soap. Use blotting and dabbing motions and avoid hard scrubbing.Remember to use as little water as possible when cleaning spills and stains.
 If your first attempt is unsuccessful, try a slightly stronger cleaner. Find an enzyme cleaner in a spray bottle at a nearby home, grocery, or department store. Spray the stained area or, to remove heavy duty odors, the entire pillow.Let the cleaner stand for five minutes after spraying.
Spray the pillow lightly and avoid saturating it.
 You can make a quick vinegar solution if you need to remove a stain right away but don’t have an enzyme cleaner on hand. Mix together one part cool water and one part white distilled vinegar, then transfer the solution to a spray bottle. Add a teaspoon of lemon juice to the solution to help cut the vinegar smell.Spray the pillow lightly with the vinegar solution then let it stand for five minutes.
 After letting the cleaner stand for five minutes, dampen a clean cloth or paper towel with cool water. Use it to blot the affected area and gradually work out the stain.Repeat the spray, let stand, and blot process until you’ve removed the stain.
 If you can’t remove a stain, remember that the pillow will be covered by its case and the stain won’t be visible. Don’t scrub or soak the pillow or use a harsh cleaner. If there’s no bad odor, it’s better to have an invisible stain than a ruined pillow., Give the pillow 12 to 24 hours to air dry completely or use a blow dryer on a cool setting. Replacing the pillowcase while the pillow is still wet could encourage mold growth. Using the pillow while it’s still wet could damage the foam.

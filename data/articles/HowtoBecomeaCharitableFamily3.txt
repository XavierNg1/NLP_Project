 Have open conversations on a regular basis about what giving back means on a local and global level. Consider discussing current events in your community or in the news as a starting point.Children and teens are more likely to give back and see the importance of philanthropy if you spend more time talking about those things around the dinner table.
Work together to find causes make everyone feel better as a family. Some family members may have certain interests in protecting wildlife while others may be interested in supporting the arts. Talk about what each cause does as a family, and work towards understanding each person's perspective on the cause.
 You may get caught up in your busy lives. You may forget that being charitable is about what you do each day. Being charitable isn't just something you do on Saturdays when you help out at the soup kitchen. It's every day.Learn from each other about the basics of helping others. Share a seat with someone on the ride to work or school. Share your lunch with a classmate or co-worker. Open the door for others.
Be thoughtful each day. At the end of a long day, talk as a family about one thing that each person is grateful for. Gratitude helps to foster a charitable family.
 Maybe one of your family members is more compassionate and focused on charitable causes. Learn by their example on how to be generous and respect others.No matter whether you're volunteering at a charity event or in line at the grocery store check-out, watch how people are kind, patient, and understanding of each other. Focus on the good behavior that you see, rather than the negative.
Practice showing kindness to all people. Avoid making it seem like some people are more worthy than others of your time and attention. Learn as a family how to respect people equally. Talk about the importance of honoring each person's dignity and worth as a human being.

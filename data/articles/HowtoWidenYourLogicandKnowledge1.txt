 Ad hominem attacks happen by placing doubt on someone's character or attributes to discredit their arguments. When someone does this, they are undermining someone's case without providing logical evidence as to why. It is important to listen to information and disconnect it from feelings you may have for that person. This will allow you to pull out the facts and stay logical., Emotional appeals are often used in order to get a reader or listener to respond out of sympathy and it can lead someone to act against their better judgement. Be sure to watch out for these types of manipulations and to keep a clear head., It is very common for someone to agree with an idea or opinion merely because it is the popular one. When deciding your own thoughts, views, or opinions on a particular issue, be sure you know why you feel a certain way. Do not just agree to something because everyone else is going along. Always back your opinions up with your own personal logic and research., This is a pragmatic defect in an argument in which the end result ends up being the starting point.

The argument fails to have valid evidence because the foundation for proof does not have real evidence.Here is a common example:


Person A, "Go to bed."
Person B, "Why?"
Person A, "Because I said to go to bed."

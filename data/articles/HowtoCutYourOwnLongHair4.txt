 If you want a longer fringe or bangs, comb out a section from the top of your hair before starting on the larger haircut. If you donâ€™t want bangs, move to the next step.


How you cut your bangs will depend on the style of your pixie cut. For wispy bangs that blend with your pixie cut, cut into your fringe at a 75-degree angle while moving diagonally across your face.
For more blunt bangs, cut straight across from ear to ear, moving across your hair in small sections as you go.
, Put your fingers near the bottom of how long you want your crop to be, and cut there.
, You want to cut a straight, even line as you do so. Take as much off as you want to achieve the desired length.
 Using the previously cut section as a guide, pull a small amount of hair into parallel to the first cut section, and cut accordingly. Continue taking parallel sections, using a small piece of the last cut section as a guide. Refine the edges when you are done so that it is even and balanced.

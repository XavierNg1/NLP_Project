 Opt to upgrade old trash containers to newer versions that don't hold odor if you can. Some communities provide the designated container to residents already. But others the resident of the home has to provide the container on their own. When choosing plastic ones look for ones with smoother interiors and number 5 plastic which lets odor causing juices slide off in case your bags bust inside the can. Metal cans should be made of polished stainless steel or high quality aluminium., If you can't upgrade the can at least consider a better bag. Low quality bags also can mean doubling you bags which is a waste of extra bags. Bad quality bags that break, bust and lose handles are open invitation to flies and other pest. Shop around different brands to find a quality bag.

There are bags with fragrances which can be irritating to some people and don't smell like the real source of the original fragrances. You can always find natural alternatives and make your own.

 The Start menu lets you open programs and shut down or restart your computer. The Start button can be found in the lower-left hand corner of the screen.
 When you click Power, you will see three options: Sleep, Shut Down, and Restart.



You can use the Shift + Restart combination from the Sign In screen if ever you need to reboot from there.
 From the Choose an Option screen, click the Troubleshoot icon then click the Advanced Options icon. Choose “Startup Settings” from the Advanced Options screen.
 At Startup Settings, click/tap the “Restart” button. Your screen will blank out for a few minutes while your device restarts and enters the Startup Settings screen. The Startup Settings screen will present you with options numbered 1–9. Three of these options will activate safe mode:


Press “4” or “F4” if you want to boot in (minimal) safe mode.
Press “5” or “F5” if you want to boot in safe mode with networking enabled.
Press “6” or “F6” if you want to boot in safe mode with the command prompt.
After you press the number representing one of these options, your device reboots in one of the safe mode settings.

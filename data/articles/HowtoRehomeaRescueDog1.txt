 If you are a relaxed person who prefers cuddling up at home with a blanket and a book, think about getting a more relaxed dog. If you are outside a lot enjoying parks, good weather, and plentiful exercise, you may want a dog who is able to keep up.When looking at dogs, pay attention to their energy. An energetic dog will bound up to you, excited to meet you, while a more laid-back dog may hang back.;
, An elderly dog is a good option if you want a quieter, more mature dog. Puppies are fun to watch and playful, but they take a lot of time and energy. On the other hand, you may have fewer bad habits to correct. A dog that's a couple of years old can still be puppyish but maybe not so rambunctious., If you live in an apartment, you may not want a high-energy large dog. They require constant attention, as well as a good deal of exercise that you may not be able to provide in a small apartment. A high-energy dog does well with a large yard to play in., Rescue dogs in particular may have issues with certain people. For instance, a dog that was abused by a man may decide that it doesn't like all men. Other dogs may not like kids. Therefore, it's important to make sure your whole family meets the dog before bringing it home.Let each family member interact with the dog, petting and playing with it. If it snaps or growls, back off. That may not be a good choice for you.
A rescue worker can also help you judge how a dog is interacting with your kids. They should be able to tell if the dog wouldn't be a good fit.
 If a dog has known issues, such as bathroom issues, aggression problems, or a health problem, think long and hard about whether you are really equipped to handle it. Of course, that dog needs a home, but you won't do it any good by taking it home only to return it a week later because you can't keep up.In that same vein, it's a good idea to take your new dog to the vet right away to be checked out. That way, you know what you're in for in terms of health issues.

 Unfortunately you can’t play the game if you don’t have the deck of cards. Phase 10 is made and distributed by Mattel Games, the maker of Uno. You can find the card game online at their website . If you don’t want to order online try checking your local game store.;
, You need between two and six people to play Phase 10. It isn’t a single player game so you will need some friends who want to play with you to join in.
 You will want a big table with seats for everyone. The game can get pretty spread out and you are dealing a whole deck so make sure everyone has enough room. If you don’t have a suitable table you can always play on the floor.

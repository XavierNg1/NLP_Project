 Give people the benefit of the doubt, even people of whom you might have a bad first impression. Everyone is fighting a big fight. Assume they have good reasons for being the way they are, doing what they do, and believing what they believe.
 It's too easy to come up with reasons to dislike someone, to disrespect someone, or to dismiss them. Instead, look for the spark and the warmth in people. Decide to like them, and it'll be much easier to show respect.


Translate a person's quirks into strengths to help change your attitude. Instead of thinking, "That person is mouthy and egotistical" say "That person really speaks her mind. I like that spark."

, Keep a lid on it sometimes. Learn to distinguish between confrontations that need to happen and silly arguments. You'll keep yourself sane and earn the respect of others by learning to keep quiet. Don't get dragged into the muck.
 Don't get mixed up in other peoples' business and create unnecessary enemies. Busybodies make quick enemies, usually because there's not enough going on to keep them occupied. Stay busy and keep your life full of interesting and engaging activities so you don't have the time and energy to worry about what your neighbors are doing, or how your classmates are doing on their homework.


Take up new hobbies and spend less time on Facebook. Getting your stalk on is a good time filler, but it can breed resentments and jealousies where none need be.
 Giving people you don't like the cold shoulder may be the easiest way to avoid confrontations, but it can also be cruel and rude, especially in school or at work where everyone likes to feel included. You don't have to be best friends, but respect people by including them.


Aim for at least one friendly attempt with people you don't especially like. "How are you today?" will at least show that you're trying. You might even change the way you feel.

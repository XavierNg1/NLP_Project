You should see a window pop up.
 Now do you see a spot that says "Home page" and there is a place you can type? That place where you can type is the webpage of your homepage.


Let's say you change your home page into Google. You must type in "www.Google.com". You can't just write in Google.
 It means if you're on Google, you don't have to type in "www.google.com". You can press on "Set to Current page" and that's it!

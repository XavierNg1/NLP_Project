 Just cut or tear the top of the broccoli package to take out the broccoli. It may be easier to cut the package.
 Place the desired portion in a pot with 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of water. Warm it over medium heat just until the water begins to boil. Immediately remove the pot from the burner..


If you're cooking it in a microwave, cook it for 1 - 3 minutes, depending on the strength of your microwave and the amount of broccoli being cooked. Broccoli should be cooked al dente. If it is still partially frozen, cook it for more time in 30-second increments until it's done, and then remove it from the microwave. Place it in a covered microwave-safe dish with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water.
 After you strain the broccoli, you can serve it plain or with seasoning, or incorporate it into another recipe.

 Make sure you are confident and welcoming, making both people feel comfortable with your services. It is important to communicate expectations and goals at the very beginning of your job, so that everyone's voice is being heard. Allow the child and parent to have a discussion with you about the areas in which the child experiences struggles or successes. For example, they may have a fantastic vocabulary, but have difficulty with sentence structure.;
,,, This way, both you and your student know exactly what the teacher is looking for.
 I know this sounds pretty obvious, but some students can often become dependent on their tutor or parent to do their work for them out of fear of making mistakes. Make sure you are gradually doing less and less work for the child. Tutoring/teaching is all about allowing the student to become a life-long learner who can sustain their own independent learning practice.
 If the student started working with you when they were receiving mainly low grades, it is unfair to expect instantly high grades after only a few tutoring sessions. This being said, always make sure your student receives praise for the progress they are making, and allow them to reflect on their own learning practice.
 That comes with the profession. So, if you want to get paid for everything you do, you should probably find yourself an office job in a big soul-destroying company. Teaching/tutoring is about providing help wherever and whenever it is needed; even if you don't always get some sort of financial reward. It's a good idea to share a professional email with your student for editing and feedback purposes. This could even be the parent's email address.

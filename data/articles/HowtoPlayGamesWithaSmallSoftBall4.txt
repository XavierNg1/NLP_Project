, This can be done, by put both their IFS tips together and the same with their thumbs.
(dinner tables in this case)

, Now you have to flick the ball with your fingers/thumbs and try to get it in the "basket".(circle) If the ball flies off in the wrong direction, your friend can move their "basket" if they wish.

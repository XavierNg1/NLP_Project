 If you don’t want to purchase a specially made degreaser or scuff remover, you can try making a homemade cleaner first. Combine equal parts of white vinegar and water. Pour the mixture into a clean spray bottle., Whether a brand name or generic product, you can find magic eraser scrubbing pads at your nearest home goods, home improvement, or department store. They’re the easiest and most effective pad to use when buffing out scuffed or scratched vinyl. Further, they won’t wear away of the vinyl surface like a more abrasive pad would., Spray enough to saturate the scuffed portion of the vinyl panel. Use the magic eraser to wipe it down using long, even strokes. Wipe away residue with a microfiber towel when you're finished.

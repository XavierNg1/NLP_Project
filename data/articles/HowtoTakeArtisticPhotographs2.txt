 Digital zoom actually just crops a part of the image and enlarges it, which can lead to a loss of image quality. Avoid using zoom and instead get close to your subject. Get the camera right into someone’s face if you need to and fill your view finder with your subject., For landscape photos especially, find photos where the subjects are in various depths of the photo. Having a subject in the foreground, the middle ground, and the background makes your photo have more dimension.


Change the angle you are standing so there are multiple layers to your photograph.
Position a subject in the front of the photo, the middle of the photo, and far away in the back of the photo.
A common way to show depth is by photographing the path of a road that trails off into the distance. , When you are looking at your subject in the screen of your camera, imagine a 3x3 grid on the photo. Try to line the main subject of your image along one of the two vertical lines. If your image is a person, try to have their eyes along the top horizontal line of the grid, looking across the frame. Cameras usually have a setting (or phones usually have an app) that creates the 3x3 grid on the screen. , Slow down your shutter speed to capture objects in motion. A longer shutter speed means you can capture the movement and get a “blur” in your photograph. Change your camera to Shutter Priority Mode so it can adjust the exposure and aperture accordingly. Usually the subject moves to get this effect, but you can also move your camera to create a motion blur photograph. , You can try taking photos of your subject from different angles. Taking a photo of your subject from below makes it look more powerful and important. A photo taken from above a subject makes it look weaker and less important. Using different angles can manipulate how a subject appears to the viewer of the image.

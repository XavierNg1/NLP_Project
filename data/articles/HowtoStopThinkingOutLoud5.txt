 Vocalizing your thoughts is one of the best ways to memorize things. Saying the names of things aloud while you read them will help you memorize them. You can use this to help you study for a test or remember your grocery list., Children regularly talk to themselves as they perform new tasks and learn new things. As adults, we continue to do this, but we internalize the voice and no longer talk to ourselves. However, if you talk aloud as you perform a new task, you will be more likely to remember how to do it again in the future.For example, if you are cooking a dish for the first time, you might try saying the steps of the recipe out loud as you cook in order to better remember how to cook the dish in the future.
 If you are stumped by a problem, talking through the problem aloud can help you find the solution. You can either talk it through with someone else or talk to yourself. Talking through a problem works because it forces your mind to focus on the task, instead of drifting off to other thoughts.For example, if you are bogged down on an algebra problem, talk through the steps of the problem out loud in order to find the place where you are getting stuck.

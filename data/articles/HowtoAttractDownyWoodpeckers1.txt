 Downies avoid open spaces and love trees. To attract downy woodpeckers, you must first locate yourself in a wooded area of at least two to three acres. The area should sport deciduous trees, or an equal mix of deciduous and coniferous trees.


Land that has been cleared for agriculture or logging, or land in most urban areas, will not support downy woodpeckers.You will therefore be unable to attract them to these areas.
Rural areas are best for attracting downies, though they might be found in certain suburban areas if there is an adequate population of trees.Deciduous trees that are known to attract woodpeckers include beech, maple, oak, and hickory.;
, Downies primarily eat beetles, ants, spiders, aphids, caterpillars and other bugs.These species thrive in native plants and trees.If you want downies on your property, you should install native plants and trees, rather than non-native shrubs, grasses, and plants.


Botanists at your local arboretum should be able to help you identify species native to your area.
You could also check the University of Texasâ€™ Native Plant Database at https://www.wildflower.org/plants/ for help identifying native species in your area.
The bugs downy woodpeckers like might also be present in non-native trees and foliage, but their populations will probably be smaller.
 If you have a recording of a downy woodpecker call, you could play it if you suspect woodpeckers are nearby. There are many recordings of downy woodpeckers available online. Play these imitation calls through your smartphone or tablet in order to attract downies.

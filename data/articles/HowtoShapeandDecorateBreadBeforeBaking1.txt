 If you are making the dough from scratch follow this basic method: Mix the sugar, water and yeast together and allow to sit for 5 minutes for the yeast to activate. If it doesn't, the yeast may be too old so a fresh sachet should be added to fresh water and sugar. Once the yeast is active, mix with the flour and salt and knead heavily (no need to be gentle) for 5â€“10 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and when the dough is pulled, it is smooth and elastic.


Allow to prove at least one hour in a warm place. Once doubled or tripled in size, deflate the dough; punching or flattening it and then kneading again for a few more minutes to distribute the yeast.
If using a mixing machine, follow the same method. A food processor work fine, but ideally mix the dough by hand and then process in batches so as not to overfill and overload the processor.
If the dough is too wet, add a little more flour. Flour absorbency varies according to variety and time of year.
 For best results, use a pizza stone or line your oven tray with unglazed thick terracotta tiles, preheating the oven to around 220C / 435F before baking.


Keep a close eye on the bread while it bakes as all ovens vary. If it browns too quickly, turn it down, but ideally you want a nice russet brown crust for good flavour.

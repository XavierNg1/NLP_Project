 You can create groups for your family, your business associates, your friends from the gym, etc. That way, you can hide entire categories of contacts from the list without having to remove them completely.


To manage groups, tap the Groups button at the top-left of the Contacts screen.
 When they are checked, they are visible. When they're unchecked, they'll be hidden from your contact list.
 Your contact list will now only display the groups you have chosen.

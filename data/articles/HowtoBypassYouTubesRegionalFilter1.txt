 These are websites that operate servers in multiple countries, allowing you to bypass regional restrictions. Popular sites include:


ProxFree (proxfree.com)
UnblockYouTube (unblockyoutube.co.uk)
Zalmos (zalmos.com);
, Some proxy sites, such as ProxFree, will allow you to select which server you want to connect to. Select a server located in the country that has access to the video. For example, if the video is only available in the United Kingdom, select the UK server.


This may take some trial and error if you don't know where the video originated from. You may have to try different servers until you find one that works for the video you want to watch.
 Enter "youtube.com" into the URL field on the YouTube proxy site. This will load the YouTube page through the proxy site. You'll likely see a bar at the top of the screen for the proxy site you are using. The YouTube page will load in whatever language is native to the server's location.
 You can use the search function in YouTube to find the video, or if you have the video's URL you can just paste it into your proxy site's URL field. If the server you are connected to is able to view the video, you will be able to watch it.
 Remember, you'll need to connect to a location that is able to view the video. Your best bet is to connect to a server in the same location that the video was uploaded from. You may have to try several different servers until you find one that works.


Not all YouTube proxy sites allow to select the server you want to connect to. Search "YouTube proxy" using your favorite search engine to find more YouTube proxy sites.
Avoid logging in to YouTube while using a proxy site, as you'll be sending your login information through the proxy service on its way to YouTube. It could be intercepted by an untrustworthy proxy.
 If the video requires you to login to view the age restricted content, remove the /watch?v= part of the URL and replace it with v/. Load this altered URL in the proxy and you will bypass the age verification system. This will allow you to watch the video you need to watch without having to compromise your login information through the proxy.

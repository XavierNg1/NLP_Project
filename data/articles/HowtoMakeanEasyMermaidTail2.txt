 This technique is great for mermaid parties and easy to make. All you need is beach towels, ribbons, and rubber bands.


Thicker rubber bands will work better for this design.
The ribbon needs to be long enough to fit around your future mermaid’s waist., Place the towel, preferably a beach towel, around the mermaid’s waist. The towel should droop down like a long dress. , Tie a ribbon around the mermaid’s waist. Use the same knot you’d use to tie a shoe. You don’t want to suffocate the mermaid, but make sure it doesn’t slip off., Wrap a rubber band around the last foot of the towel. Leave the rubber band in the center of the towel on your last wrap around. This will produce fins out of the last foot of the towel.

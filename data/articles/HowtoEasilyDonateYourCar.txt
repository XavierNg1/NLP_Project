 Make sure that the charity is registered and licensed. Do not choose an organization that is not registered or unlawfully accepts donated car. In this way, you wonâ€™t become eligible for tax deductions and your donated car may not help poor or needy people (the obvious reason for car donation).;
, If the charity you are donating your car to sells your car, you may get tax deductions up to $500. Some of the charities donate car to the same vendor. But from your tax deductions point of view, it is actually not a good idea. The more complications involved in selling the car, the higher will be its sales price.
 Once you have zeroed down to the organization you want to donate your car, you need to contact them. Most of the credible charities have their website. So, you can either mail them or call and inform them about your wish to donate your old or junk car.
 Request the representative to explain you about the process involved in donating your car. This may include giving the documents related to your car, like your car title, repair information, insurance and so on.
 Once everything is finalized, you can fix a date when the representative of the charity can come and pick your car. When your car is sold, you will receive a receipt that will help in getting lucrative tax deductions.

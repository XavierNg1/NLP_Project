 Combine the cooking wine, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic in a large resealable plastic bag. Add the cod to the marinade bag, seal closed, and turn the bag gently so that the cod is completely coated. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 2 hours.


You could also use a medium glass baking dish to marinate the cod. Whisk the marinade together in the dish and add the cod, turning the fillet in order to coat all sides.
 Add roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) of lukewarm water to a large saucepan with a heavy bottom. Heat the water on the stove using medium-high heat until it reaches a boil.
 Remove the cod from the marinade, allowing the excess marinade to drip off, and place the cod directly into a steamer basket. Discard the marinade.


Do not save the marinade. You should never reuse marinade or use marinade on cooked food if it has come into contact with raw meat or fish.
Make sure that your steamer basket can fit inside the saucepan you used for boiling the water.
 Let the fish cook until it turns opaque and can be easily flaked with a fork.


Do not let the basket sit in the water. The basket should rest above the water so that the fish is only cooked by the steam and not by the boiling water.
Make sure that the lid seals properly so that steam can build up inside the saucepan.
 Divide the cod into serving portions and enjoy as soon as you remove it from the steaming basket.

 A picture can do more than just show your appearance. You can also show off things you like to do. It gives the other person something to ask about, plus it makes you seem like you're active and living life to its fullest.Just showcase whatever you like to do, whether you're making a souffle, playing a board game, or shooting hoops.
 You don't want every photo to be basically the same. Add a little spunk. Use photos taken from different angles or from a bit farther back. Try a shot taken in profile. Changing things up creates visual interest., While you do want a good photo of you by yourself, it can help to include pictures of you with other people. That shows that you're social and have a good group of friends who support you.Include photos with your friends, family, or even your pets.
 Let's face it, most people want to know what you look like before going on a date. That means what your whole body looks like, not just your face. Make sure to include a flattering shot that captures your whole self.

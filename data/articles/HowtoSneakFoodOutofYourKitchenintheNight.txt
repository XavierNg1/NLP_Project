 You don't want to put them in the trashcan (unless it's in your room) because then your parents will notice. If there's already trash in the trashcan, stick the wrappers and bottles under something else.;
, Even if they are dozing off, it will help a lot!

, Roll over to the edge slowly (beds creak a lot) and sit up.Then take an empty glass/bottle to fill with water to have an excuse if they catch you!

, Step softly on the ground starting just below the balls of your feet. It can help to keep your steps in rhythm, because sudden noises are more likely to draw attention. Try counting 1-2-3-4 steadily in your heading, and placing your foot down only on the count of 4. Walk slowly and try not to make the floor creak. Walking close to walls will make less noise, as there will be less strain on the floorboards.
 Stay quiet for a few second and try to feel the ground and listen to everything. It really helps!

, Do it very slowly and use step 5 above to help.
 Don't mess with the wrapper (if you have one) because that will cause sound! If you can, try sneaking out quieter foods, such as candy, granola bars, or cookies, instead of louder foods like chips, crackers, or foods with crinkly wrappers, or you'll be more likely to get caught while you're sneaking out the foods or eating them.
 If you have a large pocket it would work, or stuff it down your shirt or pants!

, Go back to your bedroom.
 But be quiet eating it! You could still get caught if youâ€™re not quiet!

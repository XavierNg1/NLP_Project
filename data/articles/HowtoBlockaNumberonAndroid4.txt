 Options include Mr Number or Truecaller. Mr. Number, for instance, allows you to either forward blocked numbers to voicemail, or pick up and hang up immediately. Truecaller either gives a blocked caller a busy signal or directs them to voicemail, although this is based on your provider, not which options you select.


In Android 4.4 and later versions, apps are unable to block SMS text messages.
 This should be available on a Home screen and should block a number. Select either “HANG UP ON SOMEONE” or “SEND SOMEONE TO VOICEMAIL”, then select the blocking option. You can select from suspected spam, all private/unknown numbers, recent calls, contacts, and other options.
 Go to the “Block” section of the Truecaller app, tap “My Block List”, then tap the add button to add a number.


Alternatively, many antivirus apps that you may already have on your mobile device, such as Avast, offer call blocking functions.

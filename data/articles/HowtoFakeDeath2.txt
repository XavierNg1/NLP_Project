 Some people will view this as going overboard. Before you go through with getting your own obituary published, re-think your reasons and desires for doing so. If this is for a practical joke, it could be over-the-top and funny for that reason. If you are doing this for spite or legal reasons, do not go through with this.


While planning this, contact any family members that may read the obituary and tell them the truth before they begin grieving.
 Obituaries can be as long and detailed as you wish. It is best to keep them brief and too the point. Write in short, but clear sentences. A good start could be:


”O'Neill, Eric B. age 28 of California passed away April 20, 2016. Eric’s greatest joy was caring for his hamster, Button Boy. “
Many newspapers charge by the line and have packaged deals for the amount of lines like four lines for $40 and 40 lines for $400., To successfully publish an obituary, you’ll need to provide to the newspaper a name, address, and phone number for the person paying for the obituary. On top of that information, you’ll need the name and phone number of the mortuary or cremation provider. This record is usually kept confidential unless consent is provided by you.


If in doubt you can coerce the newspaper with a fake name and use a willing friend’s phone number., Once you finish the application, you’re ready to send in the obituary and payment. These days newspapers will accept obituary notices via phone, email, fax, or mail. Look into the requirements of your local newspaper before applying.

 Just place the rice in boiling water and cook it for the amount of time listed on the instructions. Some types of white rice can take just 10 or so minutes to boil, while others can take 30 minutes or more. You can also microwave instant rice in the microwave, but it may not be as tasty.;
, First, wash 2 cups of carrots, 1 medium onion, 1 clove of garlic, one ginger root, and 1 cup of bean sprouts. Then, dice the carrots and onions, and mince just 1 tsp. of fresh ginger. Set these ingredients aside.
 of vegetable oil into a large pan. The pan should be very deep, almost like a wok. Place it over medium heat. Make sure the pan is clear of any trace of water, because the oil crackles and flies everywhere.
 Place the carrots, onion, garlic, bean sprouts, and ginger into the pan. Throw in 1 tsp. of salt and a pinch of black pepper. The vegetables should sweat a bit, but they shouldn't turn brown.
 of cooked chicken into the pan. You can use chicken that you've cooked for another meal the day before, or buy or make cooked chicken especially for the fried rice. Just dice the chicken into thin strips and place it in the pan.
 of sesame oil into the frying pan. You can gradually add the oil when it becomes necessary -- you don't have to throw it in at once.
 Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them together. Then, pour the eggs into the pan.
 Fry the rice and the other ingredients together for 2-3 minutes, just enough time to heat up the rice and mix the ingredients. Keep stirring as you fry the rice. Add 3 tablespoon (44.4Â ml). of soy sauce to the mixture and fry the ingredients together for another 30 seconds. Then, remove the pan from the heat.
 Place the rice in a dish and garnish it with a few sprigs of green onion. Enjoy this dish as a main course.

 Under the File menu, click Export Subtitles.... Then select the four options in the Filters window. Then click Export.
 SubRip is probably the most common subtitle format, so it would be a good idea to save it in that format. Give your subtitle a name, for example: Transformers_2007_720p.srt. Be sure to include the .srt extension in the file name.
 In this article, we will be using VLC. Open the movie file, then right-click the screen, and under the Subtitles menu, click Add Subtitle File.... Then navigate to your subtitle's location and click OK.

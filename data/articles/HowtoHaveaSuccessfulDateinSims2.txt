 Be sure that the two Sims do not have any plans (for example class or work). It's upsetting to forget if one of them has work at 9 pm when you start the date at 7:30 pm and you automatically get the "1 hour" warning for them to leave.;
, Use this time to see what both Sims want to do and accomplish in the date. Look at both of their needs "dice". If one of the Sims wants to make out, select the other Sim and put the action "Make Out" as one of their actions. As soon as this is successfully done, that Sim's dice will re-roll for other activities.
 Avoid having them move on to something else, for example watching TV. Cancel any self actions and have them concentrate on the date. If they are not interested in the date or cancel out your actions, call out the date immediately.
 Every Sim, at one point, wishes to "dine" with another Sim on a date. Have both of them in a restaurant setting before starting the date. Dining consumes a lot of the date time, so it's best to be there rather than trying to call for transportation at the last minute.
 The date meter determine how the date is. It always starts on "okay" and will go up and down depending on your Sims enjoys or dislikes the date. To have a successful date, you'll either need to finish the date as "very good" or "dream date". Achieving a "dream date" will make the Sims remember it as a memory. Their relationship level may also grow or drop on the result of the date.

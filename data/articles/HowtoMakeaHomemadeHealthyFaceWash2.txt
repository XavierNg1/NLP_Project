 Find a clean liquid soap dispenser with a pump to mix the soap in. Add 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of distilled water. That will help prevent bubbling when you add the other ingredients.You can purchase a new liquid soap dispenser at a drugstore or mass merchandise score. If you want to save money, though, you can reuse an old face wash bottle. Just make sure to rinse it with hot water before mixing your face wash in it.
The soap dispenser or bottle that you use should hold at least 8 ounces.
If you don’t have distilled water, you can use boiled water instead.
 Once you’ve poured the water into the soap dispenser, add ⅓ cup (79 ml) of liquid castille soap, ⅓ cup (113 g) of raw honey, and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of nourishing oil, such as jojoba. Shake the container to mix all of the ingredients together and dissolve the honey completely.Castille is an extremely concentrated type of vegetable-based soap. You can find it at most drugstores and mass merchandise stores.
Almond, olive, argan, apricot, or avocado oil would all work in the face wash in place of the jojoba oil.
When you mix water with ingredients that don’t contain preservatives, there is a risk that bacteria may develop. As a result, it’s a good idea to use up this face wash within 6 weeks.
 When you’re ready to use the face wash, splash your face with lukewarm water. Dispense a pump of the cleanser into your hand, and use your fingers to gently massage it over your skin.It’s best not to use a washcloth to remove the face wash from your skin. Dry skin can get irritated easily if you scrub it too roughly.
 After you’ve massaged the face wash into your skin, use lukewarm water to rinse your face thoroughly. Pat your face dry with a clean towel, and apply your usual moisturizer while your skin is still slightly damp to lock in the moisture.

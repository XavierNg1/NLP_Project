 Don't lean in or nod towards the other person. Keep a sound distance between the two of you.
 And that you absolutely mean it.
 State that you're absolutely exhausted and that while you've had a good time, you can't think of anything better than a solid night's sleep in your comfortable PJs. Add in that you've remembered you need to get to work/a lecture early next morning too.
 Do not make conversation, hang about the gate or draw things out. Anything of the sort suggests that the only ending is a kiss. If you'd like to date again, simply say so, then finish with "goodnight".
 Make it a bear hug, big, cuddly and kind, without a hint of leading to a kiss.
 Turn your head so that the kiss lands on your cheek. You could also duck to retrieve an imaginary item or shut the door gently, supposing it was already over for the night.

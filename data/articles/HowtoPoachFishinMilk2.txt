 Turn on the oven to 375 degrees F (190 C). Pour 2 cups (500ml) of whole milk and 1 pinch of salt in a shallow dish. Stir the salt into the milk. Set two skinless fillets of fish, each weighing about 1/3 of a pound (150g) into the baking dish so the milk comes about halfway up the sides of the fish.Ensure that the dish you use is heatproof before you put it in the oven.
 Place the dish with the fish in the oven and bake it for 10 to 15 minutes. Lay a piece of wax paper or parchment paper over the fish so the moisture from the milk doesn't escape. Check the fish with a fork to see if it flakes. If the fish doesn't, add a few minutes to the cooking time and check again.You can bake the fish while they're frozen. Just add about 10 minutes to the cooking time.
Avoid flipping or turning the fish over. It should cook evenly in the oven.
 You can serve the poached fish directly from the oven along with sides of your choice. You can also broil it for a few minutes under high heat before serving. This will give the fish a golden brown color.Simple garnishes for milk poached fish include paprika, parsley, lemon wedges, and butter.

 The best place to work is outside. If you can't work outside, open up a window or turn on a fan. Bleach can get stinky and cause headaches if you don't have enough fresh air.;
, Spread some newspapers, a plastic tablecloth, or some old towels over your work surface. This will help protect it from getting stained.
 If your shoes are dirty, you may not see the effects of the bleach as well. If necessary, wash your shoes in a bucket of soap and water, and let them dry.

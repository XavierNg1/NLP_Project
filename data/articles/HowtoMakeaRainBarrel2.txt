 The hole should be large enough to accommodate the rainwater flowing into it from out of your rain spout. A four to six inch diameter circle is a good place to start, or however large you need to accommodate your skimmer basket.


If the top of your barrel is thinner, you can also just use an exacto-knife.
 You want to make sure that leaves, sticks and other debris, as well as bugs and animals don't get into your barrel.


For this you can secure a screen over the intake hole (or simply cover the entire top of the barrel and put the top back on). Make sure you don't use metal screening that will rust, or anything with gaps big enough to let in mosquitoes.
You can also set a special skimmer basket into the intake. A skimmer basket doesn't block as easily and can be removed to toss out collected debris and make maintenance easier.

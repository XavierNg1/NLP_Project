 One of the main causes of oil turning rancid is exposure to too much oxygen. When you are not using the oil, keep the cap or lid on the container.;
, Even if the oil comes in a clear, glass bottle, consider transferring it to a blue or green one. Sunlight degrades the quality of oil, and a dark-colored bottle will help to keep that from happening. Use a funnel to help guide the oil into the new bottle without spillage.


Brown colored glass is not recommended because it lets in too much light.If you own more than one type of oil, don't forget to label the bottles.
You can reuse dark-colored wine and vinegar bottles.You can buy dark-colored bottles from a cooking equipment store., Plastic tends to leach chemicals over time.When this happens, it will affect the overall taste of the oil.If your oil came in a plastic bottle, consider transferring it to a glass bottle or jar with a tight-fitting lid.
 These metals create a chemical reaction when they come in contact with oil and make it unsafe to use., Some oils come in a large bottle or tin. These are often heavy and difficult to move. You can make use of this oil easier by transferring a small amount of the oil into a dark-colored glass bottle (see above for suggestions).


Pour the oil out from the bottle when you are ready to use it.
When the small bottle becomes empty, refill it with more oil from the larger container. The smaller bottle will be a lot easier to manage than that large, heavy tin or bottle.

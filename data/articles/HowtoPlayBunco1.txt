 Players roll dice and accumulate ‘wins’ (or "buncos".) The person with the most wins or Buncos at the end of the game is the winner., Each round correlates to a number on the die; the first round correlates with the one on the die, round two correlates with the two, etc. If a player rolls the dice and gets three of the number that the round correlates to, the person gets a bunco.



Example: If it is round four and the player rolls the dice and three of them land on four, that player gets a bunco.
 Bunco is played with 12 people because it is divisible by four.If you are playing with more or less than 12 people, make sure that you are playing with enough people so that there are four players at each table.
If you are playing with an odd amount of people, assign a “ghost” to someone. The partner of the “ghost” rolls and keeps score for the “ghost”. Essentially one person on the team with an uneven number gets to roll and keep score twice.
 The head table controls the pace of the game. The game begins with the head table rings the bell. To pick the players who will be at the head table:


Collect all 12 score sheets. Assign someone to draw small stars on four of the card sheets.
Shuffle the sheets. Have each player select a sheet. Those who pick sheets with stars are the players who will begin at the head table.
 There should be four people at each table. A typical Bunco game consists of three tables--one “losing” table, one “middle” table and one head table. The head table is the best, the middle is middle, and the losing table is worst.
 People across from each other are teammates. However, keep in mind that this will change every round.
 This person will play the game, but will also be in charge of keeping track of points for the team he/she is on.
 Each table should have a spiral notebook to write the score in, 3 dice, a score sheet for each player, and a pencil for each of the four people at the table.

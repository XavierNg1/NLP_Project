 You're going to be cutting the stem in half or in fourths and putting each half or quarter into a separate dye basin. Many rose stems need to be fairly short in order to do this, although not all need to be, especially if you can find a tall glass for your dye basin.
 If you want a truly mind-blowing tie-dye experience, cut the rose in fourths. Otherwise, just cut the stem in half. Creating two semi-stems should give you more than enough flower power â€” don't you worry.


You don't have to cut the stem of the roses all the way up to the bottom of the flower. In most cases, cutting the stem up about halfway will be sufficient for the dyeing process.
 Popsicle molds make ideal receptacles for dyes, giving you the opportunity to dye several flowers at once. If you can't find a popsicle mold, consider using two glasses or two vases for each rose.
 Only a little amount is necessary, as long as it submerges the bottom of the rose stem.


Try getting colors that match or interact well together. Red and pink work well, as do green and yellow; blue and purple; yellow and orange; green and blue.
 After about 8 hours, you'll begin to see some very nice coloring in your rose petals. After 24 hours, your rose petals should be almost a completely different color.
 Your roses are ready to present or dry out for posterity!

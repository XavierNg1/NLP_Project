 Inflate a kiddie swimming pool, but instead of filling it with water, fill it with plastic Easter eggs. You can roll around in it for fun, or hide prizes in some of the eggs as part of a scavenger hunt., Fill 10-20 eggs with small toys or objects in pairs of two, such that each item has a matching item in another egg. Lay the eggs out in a grid pattern and play a memory game, where each player gets to open one egg per turn. You will use your memory skills to make matches among the eggs. The player with the most matches at the end wins.
 A classic field-day race involves balancing an egg on a spoon and running from one side of the field to the other. Do a less messy version using plastic Easter eggs. You can time who can cross the field fastest, who can do it without dropping the egg and any other number of challenges., Fill your egg with lentils or beans and secure it shut with a piece of clear tape. Shake your new, handheld maraca to the beat of your favorite song, or make a couple of them and create a whole band.

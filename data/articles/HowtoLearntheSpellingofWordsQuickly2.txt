 People are much better at remembering images than spelling. If you keep making a spelling mistake, come up with a simple visual idea that connects the difficult word with an easy word that has a similar spelling.



Example: The word "gherkin" (meaning pickle) has the same "gh" start as the word "ghost." Think of a ghost holding a gherkin, and you'll train your brain to think "gherkin → ghost → they both start with 'gh'."
Making connections to an unrelated idea is often helpful when you're trying to memorize any information. This technique is called a "donkey bridge."

, If you can't think of a word to connect it to, there's another way to create a visual idea, although it can take some creativity. Write the difficult word in large letters on a piece of paper. Focus on the letter or letters you have trouble with, and draw (or imagine) a picture that looks like those letters. It may help to include the meaning of the word in your image.



Example: If you keep spelling "citadel" (meaning castle) with two "L"s, picture a citadel with a single, tall tree to the right of it. This may remind you that there's only one "l" at the end of the word.
 A mnemonic is a silly phrase that's easy to remember and tells you something about the word. One easy way to make a mnemonic is to write a sentence by turning each letter into a full word. Silly but simple sentences are best.



Example: To remember the spelling of "because," think of "Big Elephants Can't Always Use Small Exits."

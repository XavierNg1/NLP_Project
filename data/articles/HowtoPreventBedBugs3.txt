 Secondhand items are one of the biggest risks for bed bug infestation, so buying new items is always the safest bet. If you choose to buy secondhand furniture and clothing, make sure to carefully inspect the seams and crevices of all secondhand items for small reddish-brown bugs or red spots.Don’t take pieces of furniture or mattresses from the dumpster or trash.
Immediately wash and dry any washable items. Drying on high heat kills the bugs, so run items like pillows through the dryer.
 Don’t let your clothes sit in the washer or the dryer. As soon as your clothes finish drying, take them out and place them in your own container. Don’t put them in the facility carts or on a folding table. Fold your clothes at home to avoid picking up any bugs that may have traveled with other patrons., New clothing can become infected from other shoppers or contact with bed bug-infested parcels during shipping. Pay special attention to the seams of the clothing. Don’t just look for the bugs; remember to check for the tell-tale red spots..


When trying on items, put your own clothes on the hooks in the dressing room rather than the seating area because bugs are most likely to hide there.

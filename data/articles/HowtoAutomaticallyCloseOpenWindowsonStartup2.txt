 There are two main ways to open this window:


Press âŠž Win+R.
Open the Start menu and select "Run".
 This will display a list of all of the programs that run when Windows loads.
 Browse through the list of programs until you find the one you want to disable. Perform a web search using the "Startup Item" name and "Manufacturer" if you are unsure about the program.
 If a program's box is checked, it will load when Windows starts. Uncheck the box for each program that you want to prevent from loading when Windows starts.
 You will be prompted to restart your computer, but you don't have to right away. Your changes will take effect the next time Windows loads., If you disable a program and it keeps coming back, or you've disabled everything and you're still getting pop-ups, you may have a virus infection. Use a reputable antivirus program like Microsoft Security Essentials or Kaspersky, along with a malware removal program like Malwarebytes Antimalware (malwarebytes.org).

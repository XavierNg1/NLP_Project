Non-leap years will be referred to throughout the guide as “normal years.” The Gregorian calendar repeats exactly every 400 years. Note that the Gregorian calendar has been reformed in the past and that this algorithm only applies to the Gregorian calendar in its most recent state. For more information on this reform and its consequences for calculating the day of the week, refer to the “Julian calendar” section of the Wikipedia article entitled “Doomsday rule”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule#Julian_calendar.
In this guide, the notation “C.E.” and “B.C.E.” will be used. “C.E.” means “Common Era” and is equivalent to “A.D.” “B.C.E.” means “Before the Common Era” and is equivalent to “B.C.” For more information refer to the Wikipedia article entitled “Common Era”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era. Think of C.E. years as positive and B.C.E. years as negative (but subtract one from them first). For example, think of 1670 C.E. as 1670, but think of 1540 B.C.E. as -1539. Note that there is no year 0 in the Gregorian calendar, so you must subtract 1 from 1540 before placing a negative sign in front of it. For a more detailed explanation, see the Wikipedia article entitled “Astronomical year numbering”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_year_numbering.
In this guide, the formats mm/dd and mm/dd/yyyy will be used to represent dates in compact form. For example, 8/6 is equivalent to August 6th, 7/24/1670 is equivalent to July 24th, 1670 C.E., 12/6/534 is equivalent to December 6th, 534 C.E., and 10/23/-1889 is equivalent to October 23rd, 1890 B.C.E.
 April, June, September, and November have 30 days. February has 28 days during a normal year and 29 days during a leap year. Leap day, that is, the day that only exists during a leap year, is February 29. There is a useful mnemonic to distinguish between months with 31 days and fewer than 31 days. Hold out your right hand. Tap the knuckle of your index finger and say “January.” Tap the gap/dip/valley between the knuckles of your index and middle fingers and say “February.” You can remember that January has more days than February because your knuckle is taller than the gap. Next tap the knuckle of your middle finger and say “March.” Notice as you continue that all of the months with 31 days are on knuckles, while all of the months with fewer days are in gaps. You’re probably wondering: “What do I do once I get to July?” because July is on the knuckle of your pinky. Just go back to the beginning; tap the knuckle of your index finger again and say “August.” Continue from here to get to the rest of the months.
 Here are some easy-to-remember Doomsdays: 4/4, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12, 5/9, 9/5, 7/11, and 11/7. A mnemonic for the last four Doomsdays in the list is: “9 to 5 job at a 7-11 gas station.” For example, in the year 2000, April 4, June 6, July 11, and November 7 are all Tuesdays. (Important note: this does not mean that April 4, 2001 was also Tuesday. April 4, 2001 was actually a Wednesday.) You can add or subtract 7 from any Doomsday to get another Doomsday. For example, 5/9, 5/16, and 5/23 are all Doomsdays. You don’t have to just add or subtract 7 at a time though; you can use any multiple of 7. For example, 9/5 and 9/26 are both Doomsdays, because 5+7*3 ≡ 26. Another easy-to-remember Doomsday is 3/0. No this is not a typo; 3/0 is simply another way of thinking about the last day of February. Unlike 2/28 or 2/29, 3/0 is always the last day of February, regardless of whether or not it is a leap year. The world can even think of months as having negative days. For example, 8/8 and 8/-6 are both Doomsdays. To convert 8/-6 into a normal date, simply add the number of days in the 7th month (August). Use the knuckle trick from the previous paragraph to determine that there are 31 days in August. So, 8/-6 is the same as 7/25, because -6+31 ≡ 25. We may also think of months as having days greater than 31. For example, 10/10 and 10/34 are both Doomsdays. To convert 10/34 into a normal date, simply subtract the number of days in the 10th month (October). Our knuckles tell us that October has 31 days, so 10/34 is 11/3, because 34-31 ≡ 3. We can even write June days as March days. For example, 6/6 and 6/-64 are Doomsdays. May (month 5) has 31 days, so 6/-64 ≡ 5/-33. April (month 4) has 30 days, so 5/-33 ≡ 4/-3. March (month 3) has 31 days, so 4/-3 ≡ 3/28. Thus, June -64th is equivalent to March 28th, which is a Doomsday. Be careful to account for leap years when using these tricks to determine Doomsdays in January or February. For example, in ANY year, 3/0 and 3/-14 are both Doomsdays, but in a leap year February has 29 days, so 3/-14 ≡ 2/15, while in a normal year February has 28 days, so 3/-14 ≡ 2/14. Thus, February 15th is a Doomsday during leap years, but February 14th is a Doomsday during normal years. You have to be careful when going from March to January as well. Leap year: 3/-42 ≡ 2/-13 ≡ 1/18; normal year: 3/-42 ≡ 2/-14 ≡ 1/17.

Sunday ≡ NONEday ≡ 0
Monday ≡ ONEday ≡ 1
Tuesday ≡ TWO’Sday ≡ 2
Wednesday ≡ THREE’Sday ≡ 3 (lame, I know)
Thursday ≡ FOUR’Sday ≡ 4
Friday ≡ FIVEday ≡ 5
Saturday ≡ SIXAday ≡ 6
Sunday ≡ SE’ENday ≡ 7 (“se’en” as in a contraction for “seven” that sounds like “sun”)
Because there are seven days in a week, you can add or subtract any multiple of 7 at ANY point during ANY part of ANY day-of-the-week calculation. This is why Sunday is both 0 and 7. Monday could be thought of as -6, 8, 71, etc. Throughout the guide you will see (and have been seeing) congruence symbols, ≡, rather than equals signs, =, because 71 does NOT equal 8, but they are equivalent for the purpose of determining the day of the week. While finding a day of the week we are only interested in the remainder when numbers are divided by 7. All of these congruence are thus “modulo 7,” abbreviated “mod 7.” Numbers are congruent modulo 7 if their remainders are the same when they are divided by 7. This is equivalent to the earlier point that you can add or subtract multiples of 7 as you wish. For example, 1 ≠ 8, but 1 ≡ 8 (mod 7). More examples of the way in which modulo behave are -15 ≡ -1 ≡ 6 (mod 7) and 4 ≡ -3 ≡ 7004 (mod 7). The notation “(mod 7)” will be left off throughout the guide, because all congruences are assumed to be modulo 7.
If you know that August 8, 1953 is a Saturday, then you can quickly determine that August 4, 1953 is a Tuesday, because four days before SIXAday is TWO’Sday. That is, 6-4 ≡ 2. Likewise, if you know that 9/5/1776 is a FOUR’Sday, then you can quickly see that 9/7/1776 is a SIXAday, because 7-5 ≡ 2 and 4+2 ≡ 6. Remember that you can add or subtract any multiple of 7 to a Number-day. If you know that 10/10/-2543 is a SIXAday, then you can quickly determine that 10/2/-2543 is a FIVEday, because 2-10 ≡ -8 ≡ -8+7 ≡ -1, and 6+(-1) ≡ 5. Once again, remember to watch out for leap years, like 18,400. If you know that 2/28/18,400 is a ONEday, then you can quickly determine that 3/3/18,400 is a FIVEday, because 2/28/18,400 ≡ 3/-1/18,400 and 3-(-1) ≡ 4 and 1+4 ≡ 5.
 For example, every Doomsday in 2009 is a Saturday, so the Year-day of 2009 is Saturday. The “Century-day” of any given century is the “Year-day” of the first year of the century. The “Century-year” is the first year of any given century. The Year-day of 1900 is Wednesday, so the Century-day of the 1900s (i.e. the 20th century) is Wednesday. Also, 1900 is the Century-year of the 20th century. Note though, that the Century-year of the century that -1362 lies in (i.e. the -1300s or the 14th century B.C.E.) is -1400, NOT -1300, because -1400 comes before -1300. Remember also that -1400 is equivalent to 1401 B.C.E., NOT 1400 B.C.E.
 These Year-days are called “Big Tuesdays” (just to help you remember them). Years that are divisible by 400 are called “Big Tuesday-years,” and centuries that have Century-days that are also Big Tuesdays are called “Big Tuesday-centuries.” Thus, the Year-day of 1600 is a Big Tuesday. The Century-days of the 2000s, the -4400s, and the 96,812,000s are all Big Tuesdays, the 2000s, the -4400s, and 96,812,000s are all Big Tuesday-centuries, and 2000, -4400, and 96,812,000 are all Big Tuesday-years.
 Subtract 100 from the Century-year until you get to a Big Tuesday-year. Count how many times you subtracted 100. If you subtracted 100 once, then the Century-day is Sunday; if twice, then it’s Friday; if thrice, then it’s Wednesday; if four or more times, then you messed up, because one of every four Century-years is a Big Tuesday-year. For example, the Century-day of the 1800s is Friday, because you subtract 100 twice to get 1600, which is a Big Tuesday-year (because it’s divisible by 400). The pattern looks like this: 1600 ≡ TWO’Sday ≡ 2, 1700 ≡ SUNday ≡ 0, 1800 ≡ FIVEday ≡ 5 ≡ -2, 1900 ≡ THREE’Sday ≡ 3 ≡ -4, 2000 ≡ TWO’Sday ≡ 2 ≡ -5, and so on. Note that you can get from one Century-day day to the next by subtracting two from the initial Century-day. This only works when the larger of the two adjacent centuries is not a Big Tuesday-century. That’s fine though, because you already know that the Century-day of every Big Tuesday-century is TWO’Sday.
 The “Dozen-day” of any given year is the Year-day of the Dozen-year. The Dozen-day can be calculated by adding the Century-day to the result of the division by 12. For example, the Dozen-year of 1234 is 1224, because 1224-1200 ≡ 24 ≡ 12*2, and no larger years that are still less than or equal to 1234 yield a positive difference with 1200 that is divisible by 12. Since the Year-day of 1224 is Thursday, the Dozen-day of 1234 is also Thursday. Note that the Dozen-days for 1235, 1226, and 1229 are all Thursdays as well; while the Dozen-days for 1236 and 1238 are not the same (they are, in fact, Fridays). For another example, we can calculate the Dozen-day of -1713. We first need to find the Century-day of the -1700s. Since we must subtract 100 three times from -1700 to arrive at a Big Tuesday-year, the Century-day is THREE’Sday. Next we must find the Dozen-year. Note that the Dozen-year is not -1712, but rather -1716, because -1716-(-1800) = 84 = 12*7. So, the Dozen-day of -1713 is 3+7 ≡ 3 ≡ THREE’Sday (since we can subtract 7 as we please).
 The “Quad-day” of any given year is the Year-day of the Quad-year. For example, the Quad-year of 1620 is 1620; while that of 1643 is 1640. The Quad-days of 1640, 1641, 1642, and 1643 are all Wednesday; while the Quad-day of 1620 is Saturday. We can calculate the Quad-day as follows. If the given year is 1642, then the Dozen-year is 1636, because 1636-1600 ≡ 12*3. The Century-year, 1600, is a Big TWO’Sday. 3+2 ≡ 5, so the Dozen-day of 1642 is FIVEday. Subtract 4 from the Quad-year, 1640, until you get to the Dozen-year. Multiply the number of times you subtracted 4 by -2, and add this result to the Dozen-day to get the Quad-day. In our example, 1640-4*1 ≡ 1636, 1*-2 ≡ -2, and 5+(-2) ≡ 3, so the Quad-day of 1642 is Wednesday (as mentioned previously). Wednesday, is thus also the Year-day of 1640.
 Add the result to the Quad-day to get the Year-day. In our example, 1642-1640 ≡ 2, and 2+THREE’Sday ≡ FIVEday, so the Year-day of 1642 is Friday.
 For example, if the date were 9/5/1642, you would already know that it was a Friday. If the date were 6/20/1642, then you would subtract 7 days twice to discover that 6/20/1642 is the same day of the week as 6/6/1642, which is a known Doomsday. This means that 6/20/1642 is also a Doomsday, and is therefore a Friday.
 We know 4/4/1642 is a Doomsday, so we add 14 days to discover that 4/18/1642 is a Doomsday. Now we know that 4/18/1642 is a FIVEday, so we simply add 2 days to find that 4/20/1642 is a SE’ENday. Don’t forget that the nearest known Doomsday may not be in the same month. For example, 3/29/1642 is closer to 4/4/1642 than to 3/0/1642. Since 4/4/1642 ≡ 4/-3/1642 ≡ 3/28/1642, we know that 3/29/1642 ≡ FIVEday + 1 ≡ SIXAday.

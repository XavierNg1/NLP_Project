If you deleted an app you paid for in the past, you won’t have to pay for it again.
Reinstalling a deleted app will not usually recover your old app preferences and data—just the app itself.
 It's at the bottom of the App Store screen. This launches a list of currently-installed apps that have updates available for download.
 It's at the top of the screen. Now you’ll see a list of every app you’ve ever downloaded (free and paid)., This list only shows apps that you downloaded in the past but are not currently on the phone.
 You may have to scroll down through the list in order to find it, or type its name in the search field.
 The installation process will begin and you won’t be prompted to re-enter any payment details. When the app has installed, an icon will be added to your home screen for quick access.

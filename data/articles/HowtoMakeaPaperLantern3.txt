 For this project, you'll need quite a bit of tissue paper. The tissue paper will cover the entire paper globe lantern in a pattern, so you'll need to acquire enough tissue paper to do this.


You can use all one color tissue paper, or choose to make your lantern multi-colored. Pick whatever color combination you desire, or whatever makes sense for how you intend to use the lantern.
 Use any circle-shaped object (a coffee can lid, a small salad plate, etc.) as a pattern to trace circles on the tissue paper. Depending on the size of your circles, you'll need about 100 tissue paper circles.Trace your circle pattern on your tissue paper, keeping the circles as close together as possible to avoid wasting too much excess tissue paper.


Don't make your circles too big or too small. If they are too big, the lantern won't be very billowy; and if your circles are too small, you'll be making much more work for yourself than necessary. Aim for something the size of a coffee can lid.
 Use scissors to cut out all of your tissue paper circles. Handle the tissue paper carefully because it is very thin and will tear easily.
 Take one of your tissue paper circles and glue it to the bottom of your paper globe lantern. Make sure that you glue it centered directly on the bottom so that your pattern can remain even as you move up the globe.
 Starting at the bottom of the globe, make a ring of tissue paper circles by gluing only the top edge of each tissue paper circle to the paper globe lantern.Make sure that the bottom row of tissue paper circles hangs lower than than the paper globe lamp to give it that flowing, whimsical look.
 Repeat Step 5 until the entire paper globe lantern is covered in tissue paper circles. As you move up with each row, ensure that about one inch of the row below is visible underneath. This will give your final product a layered, patterned look.

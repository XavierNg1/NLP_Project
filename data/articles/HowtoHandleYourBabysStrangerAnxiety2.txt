 Your baby will take cues from you and your behavior. If you act distant or nervous around someone, your baby may interpret your actions and also be fearful of the person.Treat people familiar to you but unfamiliar to your baby warmly. Show your child that you feel comfortable with the person and your baby should feel comfortable, too.


Offer hugs, smiles, and other social behavior so that your baby interprets the person as safe.
 To help your baby adjust, spend time altogether when first introduced.If your child is upset, move your child closer to you and further from the stranger, then try again later. Create a safe and comfortable environment for your child.


Have the person hold something your child is interested in and have your baby move toward the object and the person.
 Have all of your babyâ€™s needs taken care of prior to meeting someone new. Babies tend to be more anxious if they are tired or hungry.Have the diaper changed, baby fed and freshly napped before making big changes.


Your baby should feel happy and be in a good mood for a good transition.
 It can be difficult to see your child cry and be upset with someone new. However, hanging around and waiting for your baby to settle may cause confusion and more upset. Once you have taken the time you need to introduce your baby to the caregiver and help the baby feel comfortable, let your child know you are leaving and then go.

, Air conditioning alarms can be purchased as a more expensive, yet less visible alternative to an air conditioning cage.

Most air conditioning alarms are based on the same pressure-sensitive premise, yet the technology behind the alarm can vary based on the company. Even if you chose not to purchase a full alarm system for your unit, you can buy a fake alarm sticker. Homeowners have been using similar stickers to warn thieves that their home is protected by an alarm system, even if it isnâ€™t.

Install floodlights or motion-sensing outdoor lights near the unit to increase the effectiveness of surveillance cameras.

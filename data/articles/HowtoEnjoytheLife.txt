, If a smile exists on your face, people think you may be in a good mood. A smiling face attracts people and it also gives positive energy to change your current situation. You cannot change a bad incident quickly that happens with you or your family member but a simple smile gives you or your family member lots of hope, which is necessary to handle critical situation.
 Whatever happened previously, forget it. Just think, today you have been born to enjoy life with full confidence. God has chosen you to make you a human being for obtaining happiness.
 Get some comedy movie DVD(s), watch it and laugh loudly at each funny dialogue or scene. It gives you positive direction to move from sadness.
 Keep in touch with those kinds of friends and also try to be like them.
 It can be a reason for your sadness. So, know your limitations.
 It is not possible that each person has each & every thing. Whatever you have, try to adjust with them. If you have lots of money but you are unable to get smile on your face. This money is worthless for you.
 Go slowly and try to enjoy every moment. Don't try to compare yourself with others. Wherever you are, it's the right place for you. Try to see that happiness is looking for you only and keep telling yourself "I have never heard of the word Sadness".

 Hair style can count for a lot. Schools with uniforms tend to have rules regarding length, color and styling but you've generally got plenty of lee-way to be unique.
 It really makes a difference! Try to mix it up, to keep people guessing.
 Layers and bangs are cool too. Go for a mohawk or dreadlocks if you dare! However, mohawks generally aren't allowed. Do whatever you want (within reason).
 Low/side pony-tails, pigtails and French plaits can be cute, too. Just do whatever you like. Buy an assortment of hair accessories to style your hair.
 Ask your stylist what colors they think will suit your skin tone, eyes, etc. You can add highlights or just strips of colour, or you can go for the plunge and dye your whole head. If your school doesn't allow coloring, try natural looking highlights or lowlights.


Add streaks. Try a wash-out first, to make sure it's okay before you try permanent dye. Or try clip-in streaks; they are easy to take out, and you can change the color on a daily basis. Also, they don't damage your hair the way hair-dye often does.

 Allowing the child to make a decision about whether or not they will participate in the funeral, memorial, or scattering of ashes will allow them to approach their loved one’s death in a way that feels comfortable to them.You say to the child, “Bobby, we are going to have a ceremony to honor Uncle Ted. Is there anything special you’d like to do to say goodbye to him?”

, Just because a child did not seem interested in talking about death or cremation in the immediate days and weeks following the passing of a loved one doesn’t mean they won’t have questions in the future.


Try saying, “Amanda, I know it’s been a few months since we scattered Grandpa’s ashes. Do you have any questions I can help you answer?

, It is critical that children feel supported and loved throughout the grieving process. Creating a space for your child to mourn openly and remaining available as time passes will help the child heal.Tell the child you are there to support them in any way they need. Try saying, “Georgie, I’m feeling sad about Grandma’s passing and maybe you are, too. I just want you to know I am here to listen to and support you.”
Try visiting the place where you scattered the deceased’s ashes with the child. Allow the child to talk openly about their feelings, but don’t push them.
 After the cremation process is complete and the loved one has been memorialized, watch your child closely for changes in their mood or behavior. These types of changes may indicate that the child is having a hard time processing the death. Seek the help of a mental health professional if you notice any changes in your child’s mood or behavior.

 Sliced mushrooms absorb more water than whole mushrooms, so it is best to wash your crimini mushrooms before you slice them. If you bought them pre-sliced, check them carefully for signs of dirt. You may not need to wash them as they may have been washed before arriving at the grocery store., Wet a paper towel or a clean kitchen cloth with water, and wring it out. Gently scrub off dirt from the top of the mushroom. Make sure that you clean out the gills or the flesh on the bottom of the cap as well., If you are planning on eating the mushrooms raw, you should avoid using water unless absolutely necessary. Use a pastry brush or a similar tool to gently remove dirt from the surface of the cap.If the dirt is stubborn or crusted on, you can cut it off with a knife.
A clean and dry toothbrush also works well for this purpose.

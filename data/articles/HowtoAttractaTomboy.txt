 Naturally, don't change yourself; just try to see if some of those interests enthuse you and adjust a little.;
, Do this progressively, so as not to freak her out with your sudden interest in her sporting activities.


Ask her about some sports and video games, riding bikes and outdoor activities. Try some things she does and see if you like the game or the sport or activity.
 Most girls love funny guys, even if they are tomboys. Even if it's bad puns, be funny. It's vital.
 It is not really a good idea to compliment a tomboy on her outfit. The chances are that she became a tomboy to avoid the whole girly-girl cutesy thing.
 Girls (and tomboys) don't like guys hitting on them when they have a boyfriend already.
 Do this in a way that isn't that noticeable and more by way of mate-ship. If you persevere and keep it casual but kind, after a time, she will start to find herself liking you.


Show affection. Talk to her as much as possible. Joke around.
 After awhile, if she shows signs that she likes you too then you can turn up the flirting a notch. Don't play too easy though; then she won't feel that she is powerful, and most girls like thinking they have a sense of power over love. Love should be shared, not be a power struggle.


Make physical contact. Hold her hand and look them in the eye and say something funny, then smile. It's often the way that tomboys make friends and it gets easier for you both if the guy puts his hand on her shoulder or just tries to grab her hair.
 If she is the confident tomboy many tomboys are, then she might either ask you out or tell you she likes you. If she doesn't do this, then ask her out.
 For example, a baseball game or a Minecraft night. Most definitely don't ask to go to the mall or a restaurant that requires anything fancy, since tomboys would show up in jeans anyway.

 Stay well rested by sleeping 7-9 hours a night. This may help boost your pheromone levels.Try these techniques to get good shut eye and stay on a healthy sleep schedule:


Set a regular bedtime for yourself.
Exercise regularly (but not within 3 hours of bedtime so it doesn’t keep you up).
Avoid caffeine after 4pm.
Relax before bed with a warm bath or reading.
Don’t nap too much during the day.
Sleep in a cool, dark room.
 Stick to a regular exercise routine that includes weight-lifting. Target large muscle groups and lift heavier weights for fewer repetitions. Aim to do a workout five days a week. This increases your testosterone, which may have a boosting effect on pheromones.


It’s also possible, however, that pheromones increase testosterone, and not the other way around., These two chemicals are considered human pheromones, and it’s possible that eating foods that contain them may boost yours – or at least increase your arousal, which then triggers more chemical signals that may make you more appealing to potential partners. This has not been proven scientifically, but there’s no harm in trying these three foods:Celery
Parsnips
Truffles (the mushroom, not the chocolate)

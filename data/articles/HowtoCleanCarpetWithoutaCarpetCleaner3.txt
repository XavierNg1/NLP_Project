 Vacuuming your carpet is probably the easiest and best way to keep it clean. Invest in a high quality vacuum that is designed for use on carpets. Look for an upright model with a big canister and a beater-bar head. The motor should have enough power to suck up dirt, sand, and debris in the carpet.Look for high quality vacuums online or in stores. If you are shopping in stores, try several models with a salesperson and ask them for recommendations on high quality vacuums in your price range.
 Designate one day a week as vacuum day for the carpets. Do a thorough vacuum of the carpets at least once a week to remove dirt and oil. Often, dirt is the main cause of smells and discoloration that develops on carpets.For example, you may vacuum the carpets every Sunday. Let others in your household know it is vacuum day and do a good clean of the carpeting in your home.
 Try to vacuum any high traffic areas of the carpet once a day, preferably at the end of the day. This will keep these areas clean and maintained, especially if they are walked on often. Areas like the living room, the bedroom, and by any doors in your home are usually walked on a lot in the course of a day.


For example, you may keep a small handheld vacuum on hand to do these areas quickly before going to bed at night.

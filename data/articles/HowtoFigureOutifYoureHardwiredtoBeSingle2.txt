 Take some time to make a list of the reasons why you are part of a couple. Think deeply about your motivations for being in a relationship. Take note if you think you became involved in a relationship because of social pressure from friends, family, or professional relations. This could indicate you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons, and could be better off living the single life., If you are coupled up and happy with your social, financial, and family life the way it is, you may not be hardwired to be single. But if you are involved in a relationship and find yourself wishing you were not part of a couple, then a single life could be a better fit for you., Sometimes people avoid being single and instead become involved in a romantic relationship because they are trying to fill a void in their lives. If you are in a relationship, ask yourself whether you decided to become involved in it to fill an emotional or social void., Making compromises is an important part of a healthy relationship, but should not be excessive. If you are in a relationship and recognize you are compromising important aspects of your life, such as furthering your education or engaging in risky behaviors that endanger your wellbeing, you might be better suited to the single life – at least for right now.You should avoid making decisions in a relationship that compromise your values, goals, or safety.
It is okay, however, to compromise on where to go on vacation or what movie you’ll watch on Friday night.

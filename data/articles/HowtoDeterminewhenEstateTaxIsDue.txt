 You may choose the date of death or the date six months after the date of death. The date six months after the date of death is called the "alternate valuation date”.


If you choose the date of death, all of the assets should be valued as of that date, regardless of the dates of distribution or sale.
Use the following guidelines, if you choose the alternate valuation date, and any asset is distributed or sold during the first six months following the date of death. Assets not sold or distributed during the six months after the date of death, should be valued as of the alternate date and assets sold or distributed within the six months after the date of death, should be valued as of the date of sale or distribution.;
, Do this by adding together all of the assets, including personal property such as financial accounts, household goods, and vehicles, and real property, such as a home, business, or vacation home. When placing a value on any asset, use the following guidelines:


One hundred percent (100%) of an item’s value should be attributed to the estate, if the asset is personal property, which is owned individually.
Fifty percent (50%) of an item’s value should be attributed to the estate if the asset is personal property owned jointly with a spouse, with rights of survivorship.
One hundred percent (100%) of an item’s value should be attributed to the estate if the asset is personal property owned jointly with someone, other than a spouse, with rights of survivorship, unless you can prove the other owner contributed more than half of the value to the account.
Calculate the value of policies owned by the decedent and payable to his or her heirs, and policies payable to the estate, regardless of who owns them. Use IRS form 712, located on the IRS’s website at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f712.pdf.
Determine the fair market value of all real property. Most states require that a licensed appraiser appraise all real property for inheritance tax purposes, so you may already have formal property appraisals. However, even if your state does not require a formal appraisal, it is best to obtain one so that you can be sure that you are reporting accurate information to the IRS.
Determine the value of any property transferred before the decedent’s death, which is subject to federal estate taxes. Consult a certified public accountant, estate tax return preparer, or tax or estate attorney, for information on what property transfers are subject to the tax.
 Allowable deductions used in calculating estate taxes should be listed on IRS Form 706, which can be found on the IRS’s website at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f706_10.pdf, and include:


Debts owed because of the decedent’s death, such as final medical bills, funeral expenses, and attorney, Court, and estate fees, paid by the estate.
Debts owed at the time of death or as of the date of calculation. These debts may include utilities, credit card accounts, loans, mortgages, medical bills and expenses, and any other accounts due or incurred before the date of death or date of calculation.
A charitable deduction for the value of any property that passes from the estate to the United States, any state, a political subdivision of a state, the District of Columbia, or to any qualifying charity for exclusively charitable purposes.
The state death tax deduction. This deduction includes any estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes paid as the result of the decedent's death to any state or the District of Columbia.
 Do this by subtracting the total allowed deductions from the gross value of the estate.


For example, if the gross value of the estate is $500,000 and the total of all allowed deductions if $75,000, subtract $75,000 from $500,000 for a total taxable estate of $425,000.
 The value should include all taxable gifts given by the decedent after 1977. Taxable gift amounts can be determined by reviewing the decedent’s federal gift tax returns or by contacting the IRS.
 If the value of the taxable estate plus the value of the decedent’s lifetime taxable gifts totals $1,500,000 for 2004 – 2005, $2,000,000 for 2006 – 2008, $3,500,000 for 2009, or $5,000,000 for decedents dying in 2010 or later, or more, estate taxes are due.


For example, if a 2010 taxable estate value is $4,500,000 and the lifetime taxable gifts of the decedent total $1,000,000, the sum of the taxable estate and lifetime taxable gifts is $4,500,000 plus $1,000,000 or $5,500,000. Since $5,500,000 is greater than $5,000,000, the amount listed for 2010, estate will be due.

 String a rope between two trees. The length of the rope will equal or exceed the length that your fort can be.;
, Get a hula hoop or a very large embroidery hoop as well as rope. The hoop will be suspended from the center of the rope which is tied between two trees. You'll need 4 pieces of rope to attach at four points on the hoop (as illustrated), which will then meet at one point at the single rope running between the trees.
 Take your sheets and drape them over the rope, hula hoop, or within the embroidery hoop. Use as many as you need to make your fort as big as you want.
 Now your sheets will be hanging. Decide how wide you'd like your fort to be and create anchor points at the bottom to keep the walls apart. Use rocks or camping stakes to spread the fabric.
 Now that you've got your walls set up, you'll want to add doors, floor cushions or anything else to customize your fort to your needs. Enjoy!

 Have one person take off their mount (if they have one). Then stand as close as they can to the invisible screen that blocks them from Ptolemos.;
, Now run (or fly) away from your friend until you cannot see them anymore.
, Port to them by clicking their name in your friends list, and then click Go To Location. But - you need to keep your finger on the W key (on your keyboard). Once you're completely see through but not invisible, that's the time to press the W key.
 Have your friend port to you to fight Ptolemos with you.
 Nobody usually gets it right on the first try. Keep doing it, and it will eventually work. (If it gets patched, there is a method that will work in some dungeons. You need someone to get to the boss then port to them since the real requirement is getting to the end. This only works if you can port to them which will work anywhere until zafar unless you find dungeons that allow ports).

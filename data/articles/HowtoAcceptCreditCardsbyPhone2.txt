 If you will be making a lot of transactions you may want to invest in your own merchant account and credit card processing equipment. Third party credit card processing companies such as Flagship Merchant Services, Credit Card Processing and Cayan Merchant Services will not require you to invest in a merchant account or credit card processing equipment, but you will have to pay a fee for each transaction., If you decide to use your own processing equipment, perform a trial transaction so you will know what information you will need to obtain from your customer. In most cases, you will need the complete 16-digit credit card number, the name as it appears on the credit card, the expiration date and the billing address associated with the credit card number., If you are using your own merchant account and credit card terminal, first gather the necessary information from the client. You will need to enter the customer's billing information to process the sale.


Enter the 16-digit card number manually, using the numerical keypad on your credit card terminal. Press "Enter."
Follow the credit card terminal's prompts to enter the rest of the necessary information including the customer's name and billing address and the card's expiration date.
 Tear off the credit card receipt, file your copy, and put the client's copy with any products you will mail to the client. Write "per client request," on the signature line.

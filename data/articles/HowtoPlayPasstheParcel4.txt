 Wrap many extra layers over it, writing a silly activity for the player to perform on every layer outside the first one, up until the second last.


An activity example: Jump on one foot while clapping your hands over your head and sing the alphabet backwards. That's a good one for older children and adults; don't make the activities too difficult for young children or they'll lose interest.
Make enough layers and activities for at least two per person.
A bag of candies, balloons, plastic toys, etc. makes a good shareable choice.
 Pass the parcel around the circle while singing it, passing it as fast as possible.
 When the song ends, the player holding the parcel removes a layer and does the activity written underneath.
 The shared prize should be shared around by the last person to unwrap.

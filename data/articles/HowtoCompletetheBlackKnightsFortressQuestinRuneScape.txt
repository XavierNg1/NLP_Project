 Sir Amik Varze will send you to spy on the Black Knights' Fortress. Don't get some food because the black knights can offer you some.;
, The fortress is north of the Ice Mountain. Wear your iron chain-mail and your bronze helm, and disguise as the guards. When you are inside, you may wear your normal armor again. Push the wall in front of you.
 You will now be on the 3rd floor, with some boxes that blocks your way to the eastern part of the fortress. There is a ladder heading down to the east of you that you climb down.
 Head down the ladder that is just next to you. This room is safe from any knights. If you would like, recharge your prayer points here.
 You do not need to kill a guard that will chase you, just run and go down the ladder. You will be on the bottom floor again. Run along the corridor.
,, A guard will try to stop you. Go in anyway and run away from the Black Knights and up the ladder to the north.,, This will destroy the witch's plans. The witch will then become angry.

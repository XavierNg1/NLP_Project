 If finances are a concern, then take turns each week.;
, Look online for ideas. Meals don't have to be complicated; they could be as simple as grilled chicken, whole grain pasta, and broccoli.
 If you know what you are going to cook and you have already bought the ingredients, then you will be more inclined to prepare a healthy meal.
 This will not only be a great way to come together, but it will stop you from shoveling your food down.
 A rule of thumb for adults is usually three ounces (90g) of protein, one cup (175g) of vegetables, and half a cup (87.5g) of starch. Bring serving dishes to the table to allow all family members to learn how to serve themselves proportionately. Successful portion control means that you don't have to miss out on your favorite desserts or fried food dishes, you just need to learn how much of it you can eat without it being bad for you.
 This method of eating is essential in helping your family lose weight because it allows the food to begin the digestion process in the mouth. It also fills the body faster so you are more inclined to eat less. If you practice eating in this manner, it will become second nature.
 Water is always the best beverage, but fruit juices and low fat milk are just as important. Consider adding seltzer water to juices for a little fizz.
 Take regular walks, bike rides, and join a gym as a family. Doing so will not only make you fitter, but it will provide another opportunity to bring the family together.
 This includes TV, computer, and video games. Find other ways to be entertained as a family. Go outside and play Frisbee or toss a ball around, or visit a park together.
 Camping is one alternative that includes a lot of activity and, again, brings the family together.

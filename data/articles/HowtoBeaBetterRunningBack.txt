 Straight line speed, acceleration, and lateral agility all are crucial to dodge defenders and get to the end zone, or even just make it to the sidelines and stop the clock. It doesn't matter how big or small you are, if you can't get away from defenders, you'll never reach where your goal.;
, Practice accepting the ball cleanly, gripping it securely and tucking the ball away as surely and quickly as possible. Hold the ball as close to your body as possible and protect it as much as possible. This will give defenders as little chance to knock the ball away as possible. And if you have to catch the ball on a screen pass or if you have to return a punt, learn to catch the ball with both hands.
 It doesn't matter how little you are, even if you are the fastest man on turf, you will still get tackled. You will get gang-tackled by two or three people trying to bring you down. Protecting the ball is more important, but being able to take the hits, lay a strong stiff-arm and shed tackles is just as important. You can also block people better. Bulk up to show a little intimidation.
 It doesn't matter if you are trying to keep your knees from hitting the ground from the first tackle, or if you are trying to stay in bounds, you can avoid some injuries, too.
 You have to read the defense as well as your quarterback. Sometimes, you may even have to break up a supposed outside run and you must run inside (or vice versa).
 The opposing running backs may have better solutions to your mistakes. Imagine what you would do if you were that other back. Situations can't be taught thoroughly. You have to prepare yourself for every eventuality.
 In order to be a good running back you must have good vision, which means you must be able to read your blocks and know which gap you must attack when running the ball, the gap your supposed to run to is not always open so you must be able to redirect and cut back in order to make a play.

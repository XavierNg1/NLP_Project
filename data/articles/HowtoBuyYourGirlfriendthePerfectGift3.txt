 Maybe you don't want a clean house to be the whole gift, but if you live with your girlfriend, showing you care by cleaning the house is a nice gesture. Make sure you think about all the regular chores, from cleaning the bathroom to doing the laundry., You could make her brownies (mixes make brownies very easy), and you customize them by adding chocolate chips, caramels, candy, or raspberry preserves, anything she'd like. Don't forget to take her allergies and likes and dislikes into consideration. Alternatively, if you want to step it up, try making a whole meal. Pick a simple recipe or play to your strengths., If she's like most people, she doesn't always have the time to keep her car in order. Find a way to "borrow" her car. Take it out, and clean it up, inside and out. Just be sure not to throw anything away--that could lead to trouble!

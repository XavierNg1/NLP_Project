 If it gets in close, and you're about to get hit, jump over them. Preferably, use a Cloud in a Bottle for this, as they can jump like you.
 Their AI goes as follows: "Hops in one direction, slides on slopes, floats in water, follows player, damages player." Usually, striking them with a broadsword a few times is enough to eliminate them. The King Slime is exempt to this, as he is a mini-boss.
 They can be used extremely well for all enemies. You can strike from a distance and not be hurt.

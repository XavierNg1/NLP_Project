 This means that if the words were , "She falls like the petal drifting from it's rose," you would gracefully sink to the floor and pretend to be the petal. Fluent is where you pour your heart and feelings out with your movements. Let's just say if you danced fluent to the rose petal line, you would probably feel sad because "she is drifting", so you would show that with a sad, but graceful, drift away from the center.;
, It would get very boring to watch someone do the same movement over, and over, and over again.
 The best places are the ones with a large lengthy mirror on the wall.
, You should listen to it maybe 2-3 time to get the feel of the words, instruments, and the tempo.
 This is a key part in getting better. You don't want to pull a muscle and not be able to practice, so be sure to stretch your arms, legs, neck, and maybe do some push-ups. If you plan on doing tricks, be sure to stretch extra well, so you won't get injured.
 This sometimes is a hard concept for some people to understand. When you dance fluently, like the water in a stream, you let your body pretend you are trapped under the ocean. (Pretend you can still breathe) You would get bored just standing there with nothing to do, so you start to flow. Your limbs are floating, your heart lies on a cloud, your eyes are closed. You outstretch your fingers and open your mind to more fluent movement. You touch the sky with every reach and skim the ocean's sandy floor while the suns rays dance around you. This is how it feels to dance fluent. You move your arms and legs and head so they flow gracefully together.
 To make your dance stand out, you may want to add tricks. There are hundreds of dance tutorials online. Chose a tutorial from an actual known dancer(so you can guarantee it's safe) and follow the teacher. Some examples of tricks are pirouettes, splits, barrel rolls, jumps, and leaps.

 You will find that there are many applications out there that facilitate blocking websites. Selfcontrol is a program specifically designed for MAC OSX, and probably one of the easiest to use. The app provides a blacklist in which you can enter as many sites as you'd like.
 Simply launch it as you would any other app.


A minimalist window will appear with 3 essentials.



Click edit blacklist.
Click the + sign and add any site you wish to block.
Set the timer to the time span during which you want to stay focused and not access your blocked sites.
Click start and wait for the timer to go off.

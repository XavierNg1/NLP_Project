 Moms love home-made presents, so why not put all the effort into it that you can?! Don't forget to mention the fact that it's her birthday, Christmas, or her anniversary in the writing on the card.
 If you don't enjoy making it, what's the point?! You might as well just go out and buy her one that just LOOKS home-made if you're not gonna have fun. (hint - don't buy a card or whatever you're making her!)

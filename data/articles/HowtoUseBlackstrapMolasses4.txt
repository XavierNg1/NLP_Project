 Blackstrap molasses is a good supplement for your garden, as it contains micro and macro nutrients and boosts the moisture and growth in the soil. Use organic, unsulphured blackstrap molasses in your garden for the best results. Add the molasses to the soil in small doses, starting with 1 tablespoon of molasses per gallon of water during feedings. You can then increase the amount of molasses, especially as flowers or plants start to grow. Flowering plants require more potassium, which the molasses can provide.
 You can also add blackstrap molasses to your compost to improve the nutrients in the compost. Start by adding a few tablespoons of molasses into the compost. Then use the compost in your garden.Adding molasses to your compost is a good idea if the soil in your garden is poor or low in nutrients. Compost with molasses can encourage plant growth when added to the soil.
 The sugars in molasses can help repel and kill common garden pests and insects. The molasses will help to encourage the growth of microbes, which will enrich the soil, and reduce the presence of pests. Add 1 teaspoon per gallon of water to your garden to help repel insects.Make sure you dilute the molasses in warm water so it dissolves before you add it to the watering system for your garden.

 Get a glass that has smooth, clear edges. Textured, colored, or patterned glass will impair the results. Fill the glass all the way to the top and try not to spill any of the water.Alternatively, you can put the water in a tub or other container. If you do this, place a mirror in the container and submerge it halfway at a 45 degree angle., The light should shine through the top of the glass and directly hit the surface of the water. The light should shine out the side of the glass, and a rainbow will be visible. The water causes the light to refract much in the same way that a prism does., If you are struggling to see the rainbow, position the glass so that it shines onto a white wall or a white piece of paper. This backdrop will make it easier to see the rainbow. You can use other colors, but this might not be as effective.If you are using a mirror in a tub, place the paper above the mirror to see the light when it refracts.

 Start by dropping into the jewelry retailers in your area. Assess each one’s display – is it neat and orderly? Are the items well-maintained, or do they have dust on them? How wide is the collection and how maintained is the shop in general? Make your decision based on what you find out. Avoid the larger chain jewelry shops that advertise loudly about their discounts. The quality of their stock is generally low in comparison to other shops.


Use caution if you plan to purchase online. Digital images can distort the look of the stones and you can’t hold them in your hands and inspect them closely. Opals are expensive and it’s hard to spend that amount of money without seeing something in person.
 Hold them side by side and note the similarities and differences in color, pattern and clarity. Make sure the opal you buy is absolutely the one you want.
 Turn it over – does it have backing? If so, it’s not a full opal and you need inquire about it. Inspect the opal from both sides to confirm whether it’s natural or man-made – look for layers of other materials. If you want to buy a full opal, it should be 100% opal with no other materials.


Lastly, ask to inspect it under sunlight. This will give you a better view into the stone’s clarity and may reveal flaws that you missed.
 Make sure that it is signed. You’ll need this certificate for insurance purposes and resale value in the future. A certificate also holds the dealer accountable for what you’ve been sold, which is helpful if you end up having problems with the stone.

 To keep the catheter clean, you first need to keep your genital area clean. Make sure to shower daily, using a mild soap and warm water to cleanse your urinary opening. Using the same gentle cleanser, rinse the part of the catheter where it enters your body every day.When rinsing the catheter, make sure to hold it gently against your body. This will ensure you don't put unnecessary tension on the catheter.
 Thoroughly wash your hands before and after handling your drainage bag. Rinse the bag with warm water and cleanse with a gentle soap. Gently dry the bag with a clean towel before you reattach it to your leg.Often times, if self catheterization, a drainage bag is not used. It is done several times per day just as one would need to use the bathroom throughout the day. If a drainage bag is used, this type of catheter would most likely be called an indwelling catheter that uses an inflated balloon filled with syringe to hold the catheter within the bladder and is attached to a drainage bag which will need to be emptied as it is filled throughout the day.
 If you don't keep your catheter clean, you might be exposing yourself to infections of your urinary tract. Make sure to always wash your hands thoroughly before and after touching the catheter. Always make sure to be very thorough when cleaning your genital area.This procedure in general increases the risk for infection. It is always best to urinate naturally whenever possible.
Signs of infection can include foul odor from urine, fever, discharge or confusion. Most often a change in mental status (confusion) is noted in the older population and is a common sign of possible infection.

 Making a popsicle stick catapult requires a few supplies.


7 popsicle sticks
Rubber bands
A bottle cap from a gallon jug (milk jug)
Hot glue gun
Small objects to launch like cotton balls or marshmallows;
, Stack 5 popsicle sticks on top of each other making sure they are neatly stacked. Use a rubber band on each end to secure the sticks on both ends of the stacks.
 Use the remaining two popsicle sticks to make the arm. Stack the two sticks on top of each other and secure them on one end with a rubber band. Make sure the rubber band is wrapped at the very end of the sticks., Pull the ends of the sticks that is not held together by the rubber band apart and insert the 5 stick base perpendicular in between them.


Slide the five sticks between the two that are held together with the rubber until they are about one half inch away from the rubber band holding the sticks of the arm together.
The base becomes the pivot point for the catapult arm.
The two sticks will be separated in a "V" shape. Choose one stick to be the arm of the catapult and the other will rest on the ground with the five stick stack as stable base.
 Wrap a rubberband around the arm and base.
 Use the hot glue gun to attach the bottle cap to the arm of the catapult. Glue the cap to the end of the popsicle stick as a basket to hold your projectile.
 Place a projectile in the bottle cap to be launched. Gently pull back the arm of the catapult while holding the base for stabilization. Let go of the arm and the projectile will launch into the air.


Angle the catapult to shoot in different directions.

 You can use the same cable you use to charge the iPad.
 This program comes pre-installed on all Mac computers.
 A list of all of your images stored on the iPad will be displayed on the right. If your iPad isn't appearing, make sure that it is turned on and unlocked.
 This is where the images from your iPad will be copied to. The default location is your Pictures folder.
 You can have Image Capture automatically delete the images from your iPad after they are safely transferred to your Mac. This can free up a lot of space on the iPad. Open the menu in the bottom-left by clicking the Up arrow, and then check "Delete after import" to delete the pictures from your iPad.
 You can select individual images by holding âŒ˜ Cmd and clicking each one you want. Click "Import" after selecting images. You can also import all of the images at once by clicking "Import All."


You can also simply click and drag images from Image Capture into any folder to instantly transfer them.
 This may take a while if you are transferring a lot of images at once. You'll find the images in the location that you specified in Image Capture.

 A colicky baby wails loudly, and the cries often start without warning and come in waves. You will likely find yourself unable to comfort your baby during these crying fits.;
, Many babies suffering from colic stretch their legs out or pull their feet up under their bodies, as though trying to ease a cramp. They may also clench their fists so tightly that they start to shake.
 If gas is causing your baby's colic, his or her stomach may become slightly enlarged.
 Many colicky babies have notably loud rumbling stomachs.
 If the amount seems especially large during his or her crying fits, there is a good chance your baby is suffering from colic.
 Other conditions, such as a twist in the intestine or a hernia, may create similar symptoms. If your pediatrician rules these conditions out, the doctor may feel more confident in diagnosing your baby with colic.

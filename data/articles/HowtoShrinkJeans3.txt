 Slip on the loose pair of jeans, zippering and buttoning them up as usual.

This is the only method in which you must wear your jeans as you shrink them.
Since you will be shrinking your jeans as you wear them, the jeans will shrink around your legs, create a perfect, snug fit.
You should begin this process on the same day you plan to wear your jeans. If this is not possible, then use this method to shrink your jeans a day or two before you wear them. Do not wash the jeans after shrinking them, though, since doing so could cause the fibers to relax and ease back into their original, loose position.
 Fill the tub with enough hot water to cover your legs and waist completely.

Make the water as hot as you can tolerate. Obviously, you want to avoid burning yourself with water that is too hot to handle, but lukewarm water will not be able to cause the fibers to contract enough for sufficient shrinkage.
Test the temperature of the water with your hand to gauge how hot it is.
 Slowly ease yourself into the hot water while still wearing your jeans. Remain in the bathtub until the water cools to room temperature.

If you made the water sufficiently hot, it should take at least 20 minutes for the water to cool.
Make sure that your jeans are completely submerged under the water. If your legs or part of your waistband remain above water, add more hot water to the bathtub until these exposed portions are submerged, as well.
 Air dry your jeans so that they conform to the shape of your legs.

If possible, sit outside in a sunny location to do this. Make sure to choose a hot day to prevent yourself from getting sick and to help the jean fibers continue to contract.
Sit in a plastic or metal chair. Avoid absorbent surfaces that may soak up the water from your jeans.
You may need to turn yourself as you sit or lie out in the sun. Otherwise, the tops of your legs will dry while the back will remain wet.
It can take several hours for your jeans to dry.

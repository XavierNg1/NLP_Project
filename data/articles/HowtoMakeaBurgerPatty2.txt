 Use your hands to combine the ground beef with 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground pepper until well mixed.


You can add more or less salt and pepper according to your own tastes. If you want to try something different, you could also use a pre-mixed spice blend or another set of spices and herbs that suit your liking. Vary the amount based on how strong you want the flavor to be.
 Pat it down, using your hands, into a 6-inch (15.25-cm) by 8-inch (20.3-cm) rectangle.


If you want to make the sliders more even in thickness, you could press down on the rectangle gently with the bottom of a baking pan or using a rolling pin. Cover the meat with parchment paper before using either option, however, so that the beef does not stick to the bottom of your utensil.
 Use a sharp knife with a smooth blade to cut the rectangular portion of beef into 12 squares, each measuring about 2 inches (5 cm) in width and length.


As a side note, this technique can also be used of you want to the patties to contain a normal amount of ground beef but want them to have a square shape. Simply make sure that the size rectangle you form can be divided into evenly sized perfect squares. For instance, you could form an 8-in by 8-in (20.3-cm by 20.3-cm) square of meat and cut it evenly into four patties that are 4 inches (10 cm) long on each side.
 Refrigerate these patties for roughly 20 minutes before you plan on cooking them. Keep them covered until you pull them out of the refrigerator. Preferably, you should use an airtight plastic bag or plastic wrap.

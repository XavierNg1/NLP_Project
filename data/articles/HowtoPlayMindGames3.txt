 People who are always available leave little room for mystery or deception. Instead of waiting by the phone to engage in conversation, let her think you are busy.


If she is excited to text you in the morning with a flirty greeting, do not send one back until hours later. This will leave her wondering where you are and who you might be with.
The same goes for a phone call. If she calls you, do not answer it. Call her back hours later, or maybe even the next day. Your unavailability will leave her guessing.
 When it is just the two of you hanging out, let the sparks fly. Show her that that you two have great chemistry, and something special may come out of this relationship. Then, we you two come around other people, show some flirtatious attention to other girls. This will surely mess with her mind.Engage in fun conversations with other girls by telling jokes and making them laugh.
 Maybe you two have been spending a lot of great time together, and things seem to be heating up. Throw her off course by not speaking to her for a few days.


If she calls or texts you, asking you to meet up or just chat, simply send her a text that explains you are busy. Be vague, and tell her that you will call her in a few days when you get a chance.
 If your significant other somehow lets you down, or disappoints you, tell her that everything is fine and you understand, but then act upset. This will surely play games with their mindIf your significant other cancels plans with you, say, "Don't worry about it, I totally understand. We can reschedule for another time." Then, when you two speak or hangout next, act very reserved, limit your laughter and smiles, and seem on the sad side. When she asks you if something is wrong, say, "No, everything is fine."

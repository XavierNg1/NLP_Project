 Is it because you forgot your lines? Or because you don't have the guts to be loud enough in front of everyone? Once you find your nervousness, work on overcoming it!;
, Act a little part in front of your parents, and ask for their honest opinion.
 It's all in the face! When you're angry, think about how your little sibling/parent did something super embarrassing. It'll make you actually feel angry, and it will show on your face. Lots of people will notice.
 Try reading your line from the script, then act it out. Keep going line by line until you finish one part.
 If you have a bad singing voice, then try singing at a tone of voice that is best for you. If you have a bad singing voice, try to find out the source. Is your voice hoarse? Then try singing smoothly. Is your voice low? Enhance it!

, If you're part of the chorus, then sing loud and dance well! Memorize the dance moves, and dance big. If its crowded in the bleachers, then keep dancing as big as you can.
 If your character calls for an accent, then make it very cheesy and funny! When there is a joke or a funny part in the musical that's yours, then make it as funny as you can.
 You have to get a stage part to be nervous, right? If you get part of the chorus, no sweat! If your really nervous about being in the chorus, then ask if you can be behind someone.
 Breathing in and out slowly helps.
 If your friends aren't nervous, why should you be?

, If you're scared, don't be! Just chill, and speak into the microphone. The microphone is your friend! BELIEVE IN YOURSELF

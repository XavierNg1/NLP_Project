 Turtles and terrapins tend to have flattened, webbed feet for swimming.Sea turtles are especially adapted for life in the water, with streamlined bodies and long, flipper-like feet.Tortoises, however, have blunt, stumpy feet for walking on land.Their rear legs are elephantine, while their front legs are shovel-like for digging.
 Tortoises, terrapins, and turtles have scaly skin and protective shells. With a few exceptions (like leatherback sea turtles), the shells of turtles are hard and bony.Tortoise shells tend to be rounded and domed, while turtle and terrapin shells are flatter., If you suspect that you are observing a particular species of turtle, terrapin, or tortoise, look for markings on its shell or body that can help you determine this. For instance:


The Diamondback Terrapin may be identified by the diamond-shape pattern on its shell.
The Red-eared Terrapin may be identified by the distinctive red stripe on each side of its head.
The Alligator Snapping Turtle may be identified by the pointed, peaked ridges on its shell.

 It is important to know how to turn off speakerphone during a call without hanging up on the caller on the other end.


Pick up the handset. By picking up the handset, your corded landline phone will automatically switch the call from the built in speaker to the handset earpiece.
Push the speakerphone button. If your landline phone has a headset attached, simply depress the “’Speakerphone’” button on the phone and the call will automatically switch from the speaker to the headset.
 With a cordless phone it is not nearly as intuitive to turn off the speakerphone during a call.


Press the talk button. On a cordless landline phone, such as the Panasonic KX-TGE233B, push the “’Talk’” button on the handset and the audio will automatically be switched from the speaker to the earpiece on the handset.

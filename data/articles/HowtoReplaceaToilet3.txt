 Lift the new toilet and place it so that the anchor bolts go through the holes in the base of the toilet. It will be easier if you remove the new tank first and only put in the base, if the toilet came pre-assembled.
 Rock the bowl back and forth a little and press it firmly downwards, either by pressing with your arms and hands or by sitting on the toilet. This will help seal the new wax ring.
 At the base of the toilet, put in the new washers and nuts. Do not immediately put them on tight though! Place a level across the seat of the toilet and use wood shims underneath the base to make sure the toilet is level. Then, tighten the nuts on each side, alternating between the two sides, tightening just a little at a time to make sure the toilet is kept level. Do not tighten the nuts too much: you don’t want to crack your new toilet!


Make sure you’re being careful at this point not to move the toilet too much, as this will cause the seal on the toilet to break.
 Place the new caps on the anchor bolts. If they are too high, you can trim them down with a hacksaw.
 Next, take the new tank and place it on its side. Insert the tank bolts and washers from the inside of the tank and then put the tank-to-bowl gasket around the hole at the base.
 Take the tank and place it on the main part of the toilet, so that the bolts fit through the appropriate holes. Then add washers and nuts and tighten them, alternating sides as you did with the toilet base. Make sure not to make it too tight.

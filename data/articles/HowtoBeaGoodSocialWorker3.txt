 This is an ongoing process that takes place during interviews with the client. It requires actively listening to your client and being open to verbal and nonverbal information, as well as input from colleagues and other members of the client system. Common areas addressed during assessment include:Motivating factors in seeking your services
Living arrangements, including the safety of the home environment
Vocational history
Cultural values and beliefs
Family composition and potential support offered by family
Barriers to the client’s use of community resources
Client’s coping styles
Client’s perception of the needed changes

, Based on the assessment, work with the client to set achievable goals to address their situation. For a client who is homeless, such overarching goals might include overcoming substance abuse, getting a job, and then acquiring housing., The plan should translate the client’s goals into specific objectives and the steps needed to achieve those objectives. Resources available to help the client should be noted, and a schedule created to measure progress. Such plans often include:Education and coaching in life skills
Individual, couples, and group counseling and psychotherapy
Mediation and conflict resolution
Advocacy on behalf of clients
Resource information and referrals (often including financial, housing, legal, and medical resources)
Planning for the termination of services

, Part of the job of a social worker is to advocate for his or her clients’ access to services, including securing funding, educating the public and lawmakers regarding the need for resources, and addressing service gaps and discrimination that present barriers to clients., To ensure the best outcome for your clients, it will usually be necessary to work closely with other organizations – hospitals, schools, doctors, work training centers, etc. – that provide services that are helpful to your client., Keeping an up-to-date record of each case is important in allowing you to manage your case load, in ensuring that another social worker will be able to easily step in if the case is transferred, in coordinating services for your clients, in arranging for service reimbursement, and in providing support for case work managers in the event of legal review.

 Instead of spreading all your school supplies all around your house, keep it in that one place. Keep a couple of pencils, pens and rubbers in different jars, don't just let them flow all over your desk. If your desk has drawers, you shouldn't just throw random objects into them; mark them. For example, one of them you could use for textbooks, another for old homework, the next for other supplies, and so on.
 This will make everything easier if you're late for class. Using a shelf in your locker will help hold more books and binders too. If you organize your books so that each subject has one spot, just grab the pile. In your backpack, keep all your books and folders in the biggest "room".
 If you're using your laptop to take notes, clean it up once in a while. Make one folder called "School", and in that, name other folders with the subject you'll be using it for. Place all of your documents in their right place.

 For buttons that have already fallen from the thread or truly dangling in place, you will most likely just need to sew it back in place. However, for a button that appears to be wiggling or loose, this method should be sufficient.;
, Be very careful to not rip the button from the thread but be sure you secure it in place first. If you are unsure whether buttoning the shirt will result in the thread’s demise, attempt the nail polish method before buttoning it in place but allow time to dry and take care when buttoning the shirt.
 Make sure you cover all of the thread on the button face with polish but don’t over apply (which could make a mess--even though you are using clear polish).


Allow the polish to dry before adjusting the button or adding any more clothing to your outfit.

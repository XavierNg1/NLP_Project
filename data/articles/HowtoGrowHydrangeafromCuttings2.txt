Use a soil mix that is 1 part potting mix or peat moss to 1 part sand or vermiculite.
Add soil to the pots you want to use and dampen thoroughly. Check to make sure there are no dry areas in the soil.










Cut at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) below a leaf node.
 Cut off leaves below the top leaf pair, being careful to cut above the leaf nodes. Removing these leaves causes the plant to produce more roots.
 Although optional, if you trim the largest leaves to about half of their current size, it can help increase root production.
 You can use either a liquid or powder form of rooting hormone. Hydrangea cuttings will propagate without rooting hormone, but roots will grow more quickly if you use it.
 Push down gently until the cutting is 2 inches (5.1 cm) into the soil.
 It will usually take 2 to 3 weeks for cuttings to root, but it may happen more quickly depending on temperature and humidity.









Place your potted cuttings outdoors if your outside temperature ranges from 60 to 80 degrees F (15.5 to 26.7 degrees C) and you have an area available protected from wind with partial shade.
Keep potted cuttings indoors if you are experiencing hotter or colder temperatures. Make sure the rooting hydrangea cuttings receive partial or filtered sunlight.
Keep soil moist, but do not over water. Soil shouldn't become soggy as over watering can lead to rot.
 If you feel resistance, the cutting has rooted. You can transplant now or allow the cutting to further develop its root system.

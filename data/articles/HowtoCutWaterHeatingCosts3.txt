 If you’re on the market for a new dishwasher or clothes washer, opt for one that is labeled as energy efficient. These machines will immediately reduce your water-heating costs. For instance, replacing a 10-yr old clothes washer can save you well over $100 a year. Similarly, an energy efficient dishwasher will use much less energy overall, reducing not only your water heating costs but your electricity costs as well., EnergyGuide labeling, which will project the expected annual cost of operating the washer, cannot be relied upon entirely. This is in part because smaller dishwashers, such as “compact” options, will be scored as more energy efficient, but will also wash less dishes per load. If you live in a multi-person home, a full capacity dishwasher is likely a better option.Choose an option with a booster heater. This feature heats water as it enters the machine. This is important because high water temperature is better for washing dishes. Ultimately, a booster heater allows you to keep the temperature on your water heater’s tank at an energy efficient level, and still clean your dishes effectively.
Choose an option with different wash cycle options. The ability to choose shorter cycles to wash dishes that require less cleaning will allow you to save water and water heating costs.
 An energy efficient clothes washer will cost about three times less to operate than a traditional washer. Generally, front-loading washing machines will use less water. Opt for a machine that allows you to select water temperatures for each cycle, and use cold water whenever possible. Always use cold water to rinse.Again, smaller models will have better EnergyGuide ratings, though a full-size option is better if it means running less loads.

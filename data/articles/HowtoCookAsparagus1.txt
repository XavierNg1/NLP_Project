 Thin asparagus cook quickly and tend to have a crisp exterior and soft center, while thick asparagus take a bit longer to cook and have a bulkier texture. Either type of asparagus is excellent no matter how you cook it, with the main difference being the final texture. Just be sure to choose asparagus that's fresh, green and firm - not floppy or discolored - when you're picking it out at the market.


Thick asparagus often has a slightly woodier stem, which you may want to peel before cooking. To peel an asparagus, just take a vegetable peeler and lightly stroke it from the middle of the asparagus to the base.
Thin asparagus is a good choice for use in salads or stir fries.;
, Asparagus is grown in sand, so it might have some sandy residue left in the cracks and crevices. Hold it under running water for a few moments. If sand is hiding in the tips, fill a large bowl with cool water, then dunk the asparagus in the water until the sand is removed.
 The base of the asparagus is tough and woody, and not very tasty when it's cooked. The easiest way to figure out how much to take off is to feel it by hand. Hold each asparagus spear with two hands and gently bend it until you feel the spot where it gives, then break the spear. Discard the tough, white end.


If you don't have the time to break each spear, place the bunch of asparagus on a cutting board and chop off about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the bottom of the spears.
If you choose to peel the asparagus, just chop about 1 inch (2.5 cm) off of the ends.

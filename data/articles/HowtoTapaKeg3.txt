You will see a triangle shaped valve on the keg top.



With the lever up (OFF), align the triangular coupler opening with the keg valve.
Push the tap system down on the keg valve.

You do not need to be Schwarzenegger to do this but a little elbow grease helps.


While continuing to push downward. Twist the tap clockwise.

It is important to keep a steady downwards pressure on the tap until it is fully screwed in.


Keep twisting until you can not twist anymore, about 90 degrees

, Pull the handle out, and push it down (ON).



If you see bubbles or foam escaping around the tap it is not seated correctly.

Disengage the pump.
Take it off.
Try again.


If the seating looks good. There are no bubbles around the tap/keg seam, continue on.

 This method is similar to the one above, but instead of using superglue, you will use a spray adhesive such as hairspray or plastic spray (Krylon spray coating). For this method, you will need microscope slides, hairspray or plastic spray (either will work), some toothpicks, a magnifying glass and a cold, snowy day.Microscope slides can easily be purchased online.
A light snowfall on a cold day are the best conditions to preserve a snowflake.
 To avoid melting the snowflake when it comes in contact with the slide and spray, you need to chill them before use. If it’s really cold outside, you can just put the supplies outside for at least 30 minutes.You can also place the slide and the spray in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to one hour.
 Lightly spray one side of the slide with the plastic spray. Spray enough so that there is a thin coat on the slide, about 1-2 seconds of spray. If you add too much, the liquid could melt the snowflake before it dries.If you spray too much on the slide, put that slide aside and try again with a new one.
 With the slide lightly coated, it will be quite sticky. As the snow falls, hold the slide out and catch some snowflakes on it. Put your hand above the slide once you have the flakes that you want so the slide doesn’t get overcrowded.You can use a toothpick to reposition the snowflake on the slide as you’d like., Keep the snowflake slide in a cold location and lightly spray it with another coat of plastic spray. This will seal the snowflake in place. The snowflake itself will melt, but as it melts the shape of the snowflake will be imprinted in the plastic spray.Let the adhesive dry in the cold.
 Once the adhesive has dried you can look at the snowflakes with a magnifying glass to see their detail. Each snowflake will look different and have a different structure. Compare the different snowflake shapes.Your snowflake will now be preserved forever. The slide is delicate so be careful not to break it.

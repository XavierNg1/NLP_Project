 Many paints, including acrylics, will darken when they dry. Acrylics dry quickly, so you can easily test your paint color by painting a small amount on your canvas and allowing it to dry. This should take no longer than 15 minutes, and will allow you to see the ultimate color before you use this shade for your project.If you are unhappy with the dried color, go back to your palette and adjust it by adding more blue or purple accordingly.

 If you have picked your own, let them dry, to strengthen their flavor. Place them in a warm and dark cupboard until dry. Dried bay leaves will keep for ages in the pantry.;
, Bay leaves release their flavor during slow cooking, so the longer the better. Consider adding bay leaves to casseroles, stews, soups, marinades, pasta sauces. Bay leaves also impart a great flavor to white, cream/cheese sauces (for example, béchamel sauce).
 The flavor of bay comes out nicely with steaming. Try with vegetables, fish, seafood, or chicken in a steamer.
 Although bay leaves impart a lovely flavor to the food with which they are cooked, they are not appetizing in themselves. Anyone who has bitten into the forgotten bay leaf will quickly attest to this! Fish it out before serving the dish on plates. This is also why it's important to put the whole bay leaf into the dish, so it can be removed easily later. Don't break it up into small pieces.
 Bay leaves can be used in potpourri, wreaths and other decorations, such as the dried orange and bay leaf hanger pictured here. They provide a "Provençal" touch.

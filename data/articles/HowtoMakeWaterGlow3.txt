 The paint must be a tempera or water-soluble base so that it will mix with the water. You can even purchase glow-in-the-dark craft paint for an added glow.


Similar to highlighters, any neon color of paint will work, but lemon yellow and lime green are the most effective.
 To increase the glow the water will put out, use as much paint as you are able. Several tablespoons can be used for a single cup of water.
 Use a stirring stick or a similar tool — not a kitchen spoon. Make sure that the paint is completely dissolved into your cup of water before proceeding.


Warm or hot water will help to dissolve the paint faster.
If you let the water sit for a long time, the paint may begin to separate. Prepare this glow water for use immediately after stirring.
 Turn off all the lights in the room and run a black light over your glow water. Be careful when handling this type of glowing water — since it contains paint, it can cause major stains in fabric.This mixture is not safe to drink.

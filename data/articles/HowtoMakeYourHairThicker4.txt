 If your hair loss is extreme, try visiting your local pharmacy and getting an over the counter hair treatment cream. When applied on a daily basis, these help to increase hair growth in bald or thinning patches on your head.
 For extreme thinning or balding, consider a hair transplant. This surgical technique targets male pattern baldness by transferring hair from one part of the body to the balding area. Talk to your doctor to determine whether this treatment option is safe and viable for you.
 Just as high tech as it sounds, a laser comb is a relatively new innovation that uses helpful lasers to increase hair growth. These fancy hair combs come at a high price for all the thick, flowing hair they produce, with the set costing about $600. If you’re tired of thin or balding hair, splurge on a laser comb and you’ll have luscious locks in no time.
 Hair extensions are a temporary attachment of hair - real or fake - to your head using either thread or glue. Extensions can be made to look incredibly natural, but range in price from $100-$1,000 per set. They must be replaced every three months to avoid the look of grow-out as well.
 Available at most high-end salons, keratin treatments are specialty treatments that increase hair growth and add thickness and shine to your hair. You can get these once every couple of months, but be prepared to pay; each treatment costs $50 or more. If nothing else though, the keratin will work to greatly increase the health of your current hair, making it look fresh and damage-free.

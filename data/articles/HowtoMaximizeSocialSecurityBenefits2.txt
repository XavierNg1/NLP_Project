 You may claim spousal benefits if your spouse is receiving Social Security or disability benefits. In order to receive spousal benefits, you must be at least 62, but you do not need to qualify for Social Security benefits on your own.You may also be eligible to receive a spousal benefit if you were married but are now divorced. If you were married for 10 years or more, you may be eligible for benefits from a former spouse.In order to qualify for benefits from a divorced spouse, you must be unmarried and at least 62 years of age. If you remarry, you cannot claim benefits from a divorced spouse.The benefit amount that an ex-spouse can claim has no effect on the benefits a current spouse can receive. For example, if a man divorced his first wife and remarried, both the ex-wife and the current wife may be able to claim a spousal benefit without affecting the other person.

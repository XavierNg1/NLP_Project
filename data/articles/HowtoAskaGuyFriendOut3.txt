 Take time to assess the way you feel about your guy friend. Think back to other romantic relationships and see if what you feel for him is the same. Think about how long you have felt that way. Consider how he makes you feel about yourself.Some questions you can ask yourself are:


Do you find him physically attractive?
Do you find yourself thinking about him when he isn’t there?
Are you sad when your time together is up?
Do you want to call him when important things happen?

, When you are transitioning to a relationship with your guy friend, you want to make sure you are doing it for the right reasons. You don’t want to do it only because you are lonely, you are on the rebound from a recent breakup, or because you are just physically attracted to him.


You need to be sure that the change in your relationship is worth shifting your friendship., You need to make sure you are in the right place to start a relationship. If you work 60 hours a week and don’t have time to devote to a relationship, you may not be ready to take the next step. You should also make sure you are over your last relationship, are at a place where you are ready to be in a relationship, and are happy with yourself.


This is so you won’t try to turn your relationship into something that will help change you, fix you, or make you a better person., Before you ask out your guy friend, you need to make sure you are ready to risk losing him. If he says no, you have to deal with any residual awkwardness that may come from it. You also have to be ready to deal with your feelings and move on if he says no. You don’t want to let your feelings get in the way of your friendship.


Even if he says yes, there is no guarantee that your relationship will work.
However, if you think the risk is worth the relationship you two could have, you should take the risk and ask him out.

 You can find the Settings app on one of your Home screens. It may be in a folder labeled "Utilities.";
, On older devices, this will be labeled "Mail, Contacts, Calendars."

,, Your contacts will now appear in the Contacts app with their first names first, followed by their last names.


This will not affect the sorting order, which by default sorts by last name. You can change this by tapping "Sort Order" on the Contacts menu.

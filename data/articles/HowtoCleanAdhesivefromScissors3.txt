 Once youâ€™ve removed the adhesive, it is important to protect and preserve your blades by cleaning and oiling your scissors. Wipe down the blades, handles, and pivot with a piece of clean, soft fabric. The fabric will remove lint, grime, and residue from the cleaning products you used.


The pivot is the point at which the two blades join.
As you wipe down the blades with the cloth, open and close the scissors so you can clean around the pivot., Open your scissors. Place several drops of oil onto the front and back of the pivot, or adjustment, screw. Apply several more drops of oil to the pivot between the blades. Open and close the blades several times until they move smoothly.


If needed, add more drops of oil to the blades.
When oiling your blades, you may use household sewing machine oil or scissor oil. , Once the blades are opening and closing smoothly, retrieve a clean, soft cloth. Carefully run the cloth over the blades to soak up the excess oil.


Wipe your scissors from the base of the handles to the tip of the blades.
If your scissors are susceptible to rust, wipe a minor amount of oil over each blade. Prior to using the blades, remove the oil with a fresh, soft cloth.

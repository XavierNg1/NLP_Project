 Ask yourself these questions for each book:


Have I read it before?
Will I be interested in it still? (If you haven't read it yet)
Will I want to read it again? (If you've read it)

, These things may include trophies, snow globes, and little glass figurines. They have to be sorted. Ask yourself these questions for each extra thing you have:


Does it look nice?
Do I like it?
Will it fit in with my new room? (if redecorating)

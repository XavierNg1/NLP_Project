 Talk to your veterinarian about the medications that your cat is on and if they could be causing the diabetes. Certain medications, such as glucocorticoids, can cause diabetes to develop.The good news is that once the use of the medication that is causing the diabetes is suspended, the condition usually clears up on its own.
 Many people who treat their cat's diabetes naturally are proponents of the use of Chinese herbal formulas or other natural supplements, including a variety of natural herbs. Consult with a veterinarian that is trained in traditional Chinese medicine or in another type of natural medicine in order to get a formula that is right for your cat.Homeopathy, an alternative type of medicine, has also been used to treat diabetes in cats. Trained homeopathic practitioners can treat your cat with homeopathy.
Acupuncture can also be used on a cat with diabetes. Contact a trained veterinary acupuncturist if you would like to use this treatment.
The effectiveness of these alternative veterinary therapies is up for debate. Some argue that they have been proven effective, while others argue that there is more research needed to prove that they can help with diabetes. As with other veterinary procedures, it is best to get a trained professional to implement these treatments.
 Even if you decide to avoid giving your cat traditional medication for its diabetes, you should test its blood sugar regularly to make sure it is improving with you natural treatment. This blood sugar testing can be done by a veterinarian or by you at home, with proper training.Discuss the possibility of home glucose testing with your veterinarian. This can be a very accurate and cost effective way of testing your cat.Testing your cat's blood sugar at home requires you to take a small blood sample, basically a pin prick, and to put it into a blood sugar meter. This is a simple process but you may be met with some resistance from your cat.

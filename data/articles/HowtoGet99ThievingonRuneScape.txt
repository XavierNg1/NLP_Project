 Do what you can do, pickpocket men. This should only take around 10 minutes depending on how fast you are. These shouldn't be a problem at all.;
, Go to south-eastern Varrock and find the Tea Stall. Steal from this to level 25. It takes about 5 seconds to respawn (depending on what world you are on) but to get level 25 it should take about 30-35 minutes.


You could also head to East Ardougne and steal from the cake stall. Keep the cakes so when a guard attacks you, you can heal hp. This should take slightly longer due to the guards.
 From level 25 to 40 you should pickpocket warrior women. Walk just left of the market in East Ardougne to find these guys (girls). You get 24 XP for each pickpocket and you should take about 1 pickpocket every 4 seconds. If you pickpocket about 50 percent of the time of level 25, you will get approx. 15,000 XP per hour (also minus getting stunned)

, You can achieve level 42 in about 20-30 minutes.
 It will take quite a while to get to level 55 but don't get discouraged!

, Complete the "From Tiny Acorns" minequest to get access to the coshing volunteers. You will need to recieve a rubber blackjack from the big volunteer. You will need to right click lure the volunteer, then knock them out. If you are fast, you can loot them upto three times, but more commonly you will be able 2 steals in

, Quickly finish the first 5 rooms by disabling the trap on the wall and immediately looking for the correct door. On the 6 and 7th room, loot everything you can, and then repeat. Bring plenty of food and antipoison however, as you will get poisoned and damaged while doing this. This is the fastest exp in the game, but also very click intensive, so it may not be worth it.
 These are easily afked if you keep clicking, you can also loot very good noted items, along with elite clues and triskellion keys. This is not as fast as pyramid plunder, but it is a lot more relaxing and makes quite a bit more money.

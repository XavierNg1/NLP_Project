 Most physical therapy programs for leg injuries focus first on flexibility. Gentle stretching is the most effective way to increase range of motion.


Increase ankle flexibility by moving your ankle toward you and away from you.
Write the alphabet on the floor with your foot, which incorporates full motion in the foot and ankle.
Lean forward and slowly reach your fingertips to your toes. If you can't reach your toes, just stretch as far as comfortable. Flexibility and range of motion will improve with continued stretching.

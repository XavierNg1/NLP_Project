 You can refer friends, family, and people you're connected with on social media to ride with Uber by sharing your personal referral code. Once your friend signs up for Uber, they’ll get their first ride for free. And once they take that first free ride, you will also get a free Uber ride of the same amount.

The people you refer to Uber cannot already have accounts with Uber. They’ll need to create a new account with your referral code in order for you both to benefit from this program.
The dollar amount of the free ride credit varies by area, but is usually up to $20 toward a ride.
 It’s at the top left corner of the screen.,, Your code will appear beneath “Your Invite Code.”, You can share your code via email, SMS, or with almost any social media app. Once you choose an app, use it to send a message to anyone with whom you’d like to share your code.


The person you refer must click your link or enter your code manually so you both get credit.

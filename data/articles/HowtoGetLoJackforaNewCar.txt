 LoJack's radio signal requires special computer equipment to be tracked; not all police departments have the appropriate equipment. A list of counties within states where LoJack coverage is available is given at http://www.lojack.com/Buy-LoJack-Products/Check-Coverage, and is also available by calling 1-800-456-5225 (1-800-4-LoJack).


The telephone list is usually more current than the website list.;
, The basic LoJack Stolen Vehicle Recovery System is the wireless radio transponder described above, which LoJack's certified technicians install somewhere in your vehicle. For an additional fee, LoJack offers an Early Warning Recovery System that includes a key pass you carry with you when driving and notifies you by phone, cell phone, e-mail, text message, or pager if your car has been moved without your permission. (You choose the methods you want to be contacted by when you register your LoJack.)


LoJack makes it a practice not to disclose where in the car the LoJack unit is installed, not even to the vehicle owner. Although you can witness the installation, your recovery warranty may be voided if you do.
 The LoJack website includes a database of car dealers authorized to sell LoJack. You enter your ZIP code, make of vehicle, and search radius, and the website will provide a list of dealers who can meet your needs, listed from the closest to you to the furthest away. A ZIP code search field is available on most of the website's pages.


Be sure to specify the option "I am buying a new vehicle or piece of equipment" when using the advanced dealer search.
 You can also buy a LoJack system for your car directly from LoJack at https://store.lojack.com/.

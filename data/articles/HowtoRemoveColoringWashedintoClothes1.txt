 It is important that you do not put clothing onto which color has transferred into the dryer. Doing so will set the transferred dye into the fabric. This will create a permanent transfer of color between the items, effectively ruining your clothing., Once you realize that dye from one piece of clothing has transferred on to your white clothing, separate the colored piece of clothing from the white clothing. This will prevent additional dye from transferring on to your white clothes.
 Before you attempt to remove dye that has transferred on to your clothing, you will need to carefully read the clothing labels. The labels will tell you whether it is safe to sue products like bleach, and what temperatures are safe for washing the fabric.

 Pick a new book to read together. Make sure they have not read it before. Show them the cover of the book, and ask the child to tell you what they think it will be about. Ask them to explain why they said those things.

You can ask: “By looking at the cover, what do you think this story is about?”
Follow the question up by asking: “Why do you think that? What clues tell you that?”, After a few pages, stop reading, and ask the child what they think will happen. Encourage them to compare their original prediction with what they know about the story already.You can say, “Is this what you thought would happen? What do you think will happen now?”
Keep encouraging them to pick up on clues, both in the pictures and in the text. You can say, “Can you point to any clues that tell you that?”

, Once you have finished the story, talk about your predictions together. Ask the child if their predictions came true. Invite them to explain why the book ended the way it did.You can say, “Was this what you predicted would happen?”
If they did predict the ending, you might say, “Good job. How did you know?”
If they did not predict the ending, you might say, “Are there any clues that you missed that could have helped you predict the ending?”

, If the child is reading chapter books on their own, you might ask them to write a paragraph or draw a picture every time they read a chapter. Ask them to record what they think might happen in the next chapter. Encourage them to record why they think this will happen.

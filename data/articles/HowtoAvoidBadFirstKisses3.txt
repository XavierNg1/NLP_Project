 Try to demonstrate how you prefer to be kissed. Pay attention to what your partner may be trying to show you about their preferences. Remember, a good first kiss is a team effort., Hands, hair, waist, back, and other areas are parts you might like to touch and have touched while you kiss. Your partner might guide you to touch them in places they’d enjoy. If you’re comfortable doing so, follow their lead., Although this might feel awkward, the moment after is a good time to gauge your partner’s feelings about the kiss. Look at them, and see if they look like they enjoyed it. If you can’t tell from simply looking, you can talk about it. Try starting with:“I really like kissing you.”
“You’re a good kisser.”
“I liked when you…”
“That was nice.”

 In the worst case scenario, you may be tempted to defend an abused dog by yelling and putting the owner in his place, but don't. Not only is this method potentially dangerous and life-threatening, but the owner might view you as an obvious threat and use your own words against you in court. It is always better to report the owner to the police over the phone and let them handle it, rather than confronting the owner directly and risking your life.

If you confront the owner directly, you are far more likely to be in immediate danger than anyone else. Don't consider the possibility, even if you believe the dog's life is at risk.
Also be aware that if you choose to confront the owner directly, you may end up being forced into doing something you didn't expect.
 This is a program designed to help you remove an abused animal from its home and to safety, like a local shelter. Ensure that locals will come to help you get an abused dog to safety; wait for them and be patient. By doing this, you will be using a different approach without actually managing to get in harm's way.

Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to rescue the dog yourself. Not only is it dangerous, but you might end up facing a huge fine for trespassing. Just wait for officials and don't risk it. This is especially true if the owner of the abused dog is a man, a predator, or is otherwise threatening.
After the officials arrive, you can direct them to the abusive owner's house and seek out the abused dog to rescue it. Do not go alone; there's safety in numbers.
Encourage the officials to be as quiet as possible to avoid surprising the dog. Do not go inside the house; this is just plain common sense.
If the police are able to detain the owner, have them come as well. In the unlikely event of the owner noticing your presence, you'll be glad to have the police around.

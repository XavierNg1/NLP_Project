 You can and should brush your retainer every day, just as you brush your teeth. In fact, when you brush your teeth might be the ideal time to also brush your retainer. This will help keep your retainer clean and your breath smelling fresh.Remove your retainer from your mouth.
Rinse it under cool water from the faucet.
Add a pea-sized drop of toothpaste to your toothbrush and gently scrub away the built-up plaque and tartar.
Rinse the retainer thoroughly, then either pop it back in your mouth, let it soak, or place it in your case.
 In addition to brushing your retainer, it's generally a good idea to soak your retainer in some type of safe cleaner.Many orthodontists recommend using mouthwash or denture-cleaning tablets for soaking retainers; however, some orthodontists advise against these cleaning agents, as they contain chemicals like persulfate and alcohol that can damage your retainer and cause problems in your mouth.A safe alternative to harsh cleaning agents is to use baking soda. Simply mix two teaspoons into a small bowl of fresh, cool water and soak your retainer in that mixture.Avoid using vinegar, as it can corrode your wires and affect the plastic.You should also avoid bleach, as it may get absorbed in the porous plastic of your retainer.
 You may not realize it, but your retainer can dry out very easily. It's made to exist in your mouth, which is a consistently wet environment. Whenever you're not wearing it, your retainer should be soaking in water so that the plastic does not become damaged and dried out.Use a small bowl or cup full of water to soak your retainer when you're not wearing it.
Distilled water works best, as there will not be any harsh chemicals or pH imbalances to damage your retainer.
Always use cool or room-temperature water. Hot water can damage the plastic on your retainer, and should always be avoided.

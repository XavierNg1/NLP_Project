 You might want to avoid using your savings, especially if you have earmarked that money for your retirement or your children’s educational expenses. However, you can always pay that money back into your savings account later.


If you use personal savings, then remember not to clear out your savings accounts. Instead, try to leave at least $5,000 in the bank., You can typically withdraw equity by taking out a loan in either a lump sum or as a line of credit. Generally, you can get 75-80% of the home’s value minus your mortgage amount. If your home is worth $300,000, then you might qualify for $240,000. Deduct the $150,000 remaining on your mortgage, and you qualify for a $90,000 home equity loan.Home equity loans are not risk free. For example, the bank could foreclose on your home if you default.
Tapping home equity is usually better in a strong economy with low interest rates.If the economy is tanking, then your home is probably declining in value.
 You can fund a business by setting up a C corporation with a retirement plan. You then roll over money from your retirement account into the corporation’s retirement plan.Because this is legally complicated, you will need to hire someone experienced in this type of transaction. If done properly, you won’t owe a prepayment penalty for rolling over your retirement account.
Consider the risks. If your business fails, then your retirement account has disappeared. You won’t be getting that money back.

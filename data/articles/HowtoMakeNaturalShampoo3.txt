 Unlike other types of soap, Castile soap is natural and free of harmful parabens, sulfates, and silicones, all of which can damage your hair. This soap is gentle enough to be used on hair.


You can use a scented Castile soap or an unscented one. If you choose an unscented one, you can make up your own scent by adding some essential oils.
 Try using an old shampoo bottle, or an old soap dispenser. This shampoo will be thick, so you want to be able to squeeze or squirt the shampoo out.
 Coconut milk is incredible for hair. It helps soften and replenish it, and acts very much like a conditioner. Make sure that you are using the unsweetened kind, as the sweetened coconut milk will have too many additives.


Coconut milk may separate in the can. Give the can a shake before you open it.
 Not only will honey make the shampoo smell nice, but it will also help soften your hair. Olive oil is also a good option.
 Choose your favorite scent, and add it to the bottle. Great scents for shampoos include tea tree, eucalyptus, rosemary, lavender, and rose.
 Keep shaking the bottle until everything is mixed together, and the shampoo is an even color.
 When you are not using the shampoo, remember to store it in the fridge. Use it within a week.

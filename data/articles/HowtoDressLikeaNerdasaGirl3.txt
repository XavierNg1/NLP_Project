 Many people feel nerds look pale, as they spend a lot of time indoors. Therefore, a pale complexion can really help with a nerd costume. Use a makeup brush to apply a heavy amount of light foundation. Choose a fairly pale tone and blend the foundation all over your face until you have an even, pale tone., From here, add eyeshadow. As nerds are often seen as mismatched, choose bright and unusual colors. A bright blue, green, or purple eyeshadow can work for a nerd costume. You can use your fingers or a makeup brush to apply eye shadow for your nerd costume.It's a good idea to apply a lighter shade of eyeshadow, or an eyeshadow primer, before applying your actual eyeshadow. This can make the bright colors show up even more.
If you mess up a bit, don't worry. Makeup that's somewhat smeared may actually help with the nerd look.
 Stores sell eyeliner in a variety of shades. Pick a fun, bright color instead of using black. You want your makeup to look nerdy and somewhat awkward. Eyeliner in shades like purple, pink, and blue works well. Apply a thin line of eyeliner just above your eyelashes, and another line just underneath your bottom lashes. You can also draw a line of eyeliner on your water line, as long as the makeup is safe for use this close to the eyes.It may be a good idea to pick a shade of eyeliner that clashes with your existing eyeshadow. For example, if you did green eyeshadow, go for a purple eyeliner.
 Another notion about nerds is that they're shy and easily embarrassed. If you want to develop a flushed look to help with your nerd costume, add a heavy layer of blush to your cheeks using a makeup brush., Freckles are thought of as somewhat awkward. Use a brown makeup pencil and dot a few freckles on each cheek. How many you want is up to you. Add enough that you feel you look adequately nerdy.

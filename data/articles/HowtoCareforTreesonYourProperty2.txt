 The layer of mulch should be 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) thick. Mulching will reduce competition from grass, reduce weeds, hold moisture, protect the base of your tree from lawn equipment, and help maintain a constant soil temperature.
 Mulching out to the drip line of the tree is ideal, but any mulching is helpful. Of course

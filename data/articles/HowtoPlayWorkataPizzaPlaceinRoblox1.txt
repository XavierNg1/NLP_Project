Remember that two of the questions are rude and immature. If you choose the wrong one, the NPC will respond with an angry and insulting comment, then go to the door, meaning that the NPC has left the restaurant.

 If you choose the correct answer, the NPC will ask for one kind of pizza or a Mountain Dew. Click on the food the NPC ordered on the keypad, on top of the counter.

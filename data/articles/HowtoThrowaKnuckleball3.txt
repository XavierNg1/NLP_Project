 Batters that prefer to hit fastballs over breaking pitches are more likely struggle with the knuckleball. Ask your teammates what they know about the batter or watch them playing other teams.


Batters who are generally impatient and swing a lot are also good targets for the knuckleball., Your knuckleball may become predictable if you use it too often, especially when you’re new to it and still perfecting your technique. Start out using it as a strikeout and change-of-pace pitch.








Use your strikeout pitches when you have a two-strike count except when the count is full.
If you’re using it as an occasional change-of-pace pitch, try to only use it once per inning or less.
 It's harder to throw a knuckleball out of the windup than it is when you're playing catch. After warming up, line up about 30 feet away from your throwing partner and practice mastering the grip and the motion before you combine it all in a pitch.
 Lie down and practice throwing the knuckler upwards instead of out. Practice getting the right grip and release. Throwing the ball vertically will help your muscle memory remember to keep your wrist up as you release.
 Try zero-rotation hot potato with some friends or teammates. For an added challenge, try to get all involved in the game to throw knuckleballs.

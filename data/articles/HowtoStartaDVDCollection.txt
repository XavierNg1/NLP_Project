 You can also search for movies on the Internet using the Internet Movie Database at www.imdb.com. This will help you decide what your favorite movies and television shows are.;
, The more variety of movies and shows, the more options you will have come time to watch. Choose from such genres as comedy, drama, action, etc.
 Instead of variety, perhaps focus on a single uniting theme:


Actor/actress. Pick films that feature a single actor or actress. Include the earliest works you can find and see how their skills developed.
Director, etc. Examples: Clint Eastwood director, Busby Berkeley as choreographer or Ray Harryhausen for stop motion animation.
Author Pick J. K. Rowling or Tom Clancy movies.
Subject matter. Perhaps Godzilla movies or movies shot in North Dakota.
 Start with two or three DVDs. These will be the building blocks of your collection.
 You could purchase a couple of DVDs every payday or one every month. It all depends on what your budget is.
 When it comes to new or used, the only real difference is price.
 No matter if you choose new or used DVDs, there are plenty of places to purchase from.
 Even if you only buy one DVD a month, you will slowly start to build an impressive collection.
 Invite friends over to view your collection.

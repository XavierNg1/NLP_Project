 Look for the app icon either on your phone’s home screen or in the App Drawer. The icon is a green circle with three black lines in it. Tap on it when you find it.
 Once you open the app, you will see two text boxes. Tap on the first box and enter your username. On the second box, enter your password, and then tap on the login button.
 Once you’re signed into your account, look towards the top left side of the app screen for the menu button (that square button with three lines on it). Tap on it to display a menu. Tap on “Settings” found at the bottom of the list, and your Spotify settings will load on your screen.
 Scroll down through the settings until you see the section “Music Quality.”


The first item there is Streaming, and it will have its own drop-down menu beside it. Tap on the menu, and pick among “Normal,” “High” and “Extreme quality.” Select the one that will give you the best quality without lagging.
The next item is Downloaded Music Quality, and it also has a drop-down menu. Tap on it to choose “Normal,” “High” or “Extreme quality. Again, remember to balance it, to choose the sound quality level that doesn’t result in lagging.
Your new settings will be saved automatically.

 Just as with the powder method, the first step is to gently remove the orthotic insert from your shoe. Now it also a good time to wipe it off and make sure it is clean. Then select the gel, cream, or spray you would like to use.
 Distribute a few pumps of regular hand lotion into your hand and rub your hands together. Then, apply this lotion to the underside of the orthotic insert, paying specific attention to the area where the hard plastic of your orthotic connects with your shoe.Avoid petroleum-based products (like Vaseline) as these can damage the material of your orthotic.
If possible, opt for simple lotions free of fragrances and dyes.
 Runners, hikers, and other types of athletes often use anti-chaffing gels to prevent blisters on their feet. You can use this same type of gel to stop your orthotics from squeaking. Simply apply anti-chaffing gel to the underside of the orthotic insert, paying specific attention to the area where the hard plastic of your orthotic connects with your shoe.Anti-chaffing gel is available for purchase from outdoor equipment or sporting goods stores.
 Food-grade silicone is another great option for lubricating the underside of your orthotic inserts and stopping (or preventing) squeaking noises. Spray food-grade silicone into your shoe and on the underside of your insert., Position the orthotic insert back inside your shoe, and put your shoe back on. Walk around for a few minutes. Hopefully you will not hear any noise.

 You will need a SIM card in order to connect to the 4G LTE network. You can order one from the Verizon website, by calling the Customer Service line, or by visiting a Verizon store.
 You can get the IMEI number for most phones by dialing *#06#. You may be prompted for this number during the activation process.
 This is Verizon's Customer Service number, and the customer service rep can activate your phone for you. You may need to give your IMEI number as well as prove that you are the account holder.
 Most customer service reps should be able to activate your phone in just a few moments. Make sure to bring in your SIM card, or let the employee know that you need to purchase a new SIM card.

 Young siblings are often not allowed in the NICU. Call on family and friends whenever possible.


If finances allow, you may want to consider hiring a part time nanny or babysitter to help care for siblings during this time.
If money is tight, consider hiring high school students to care for your children. They often will charge a lower hourly rate than a professional caregiver, especially if they are looking to gain babysitting experience.
 Being able to room in with your baby can help with the bonding process. Oftentimes, parents of NICU babies feel deprived of simple parenting tasks that other parents take for granted, such as nighttime feedings and middle of the night diaper changes. Even if you only get to room in one or two nights per week, it can significantly boost your spirits.
 If you do not live close to the hospital, it may be difficult to visit with your baby as much as youâ€™d like. The long drive home, knowing that they are leaving their baby behind, can be devastating for parents. The NICU staff will be able to provide details about local housing opportunities.

 When your body starts to ache so much it becomes unbearable and your mind is telling you to stop, then it is time to step into the present. Consider the things that you can view as a positive about you:


The scenery around you might be spectacular

The air might be incredibly fresh and bracing






The crowd's presence and cheering might be thrilling






You are free - free to exercise, to push yourself, to be the best






Your body is healthy and is responding to what you are demanding of it; how splendid, amazing, and beautiful is that? Hugely wonderful!





;
, Close your eyes temporarily, breathe deeply, and push on through to the next stage of your race or competition. Take a moment to savor what is around you, what is happening, what is real, rather than repeating over and over to yourself how much things hurt and how this experience is not working for you.
 It's the near present and it is something to savor before you get there. Practice visualization of how what you are experiencing right now is leading to the reward of the finish, an experience so many other people are never going to know and fully understand. Be grateful for the chance to know what it is like to push your body so hard that it hurts and to get a reward of the finality of a race or competition. It is not an experience every human being will have; it is an experience that teaches you endurance, patience, and self-control, all positive emotions.
 Getting into the present can be difficult but it is what separates top athletes from those of us who flounder and give up at the pain point. If at first you don't succeed, try to try again. Learning to love the pain that you are experiencing because the things going on around you are so fulfilling, amazing, supportive, and rewarding is an art that comes with practice.

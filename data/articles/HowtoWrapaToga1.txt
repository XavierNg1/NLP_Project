 Find a full, queen or king-sized flat sheet and fold it in half. If you want a longer toga, fold the sheet only a quarter., With the long side of the sheet behind your back, drape one corner over one of your shoulders. Adjust the draped end until it reaches down to your waist.
 While you hold the draped end with one hand, grab the sheet from behind your back with your other hand. Gather the fabric once itâ€™s pulled to your front-side.
 Holding the gathered, long fabric from your backside, wrap it around your body several times. Wrap the sheet all the way around your back, under one arm and across your chest.
 After you wrap the long end of the sheet around your body several times, toss the final end over the shoulder you started with.
 Fold, pin or bunch the material until it hits your legs where you want. It may take a few passes until you feel it lays right. Make sure you spend some time smoothing the layers and folds.
 Use a safety pin or a decorative brooch to hold the tossed, final piece. You can also tie the ends together.

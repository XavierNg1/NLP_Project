 A few days after whelping, you should register your litter with the American Kennel Club. This will allow you to provide new owners you buy your puppies with a registration application, and establish you as a responsible breeder. You can register your litter online at http://www.akc.org/register/?pre=breeder&activity=litter, or print out a form and mail it in., An integral part of breeding puppies is finding good owners for them by interviewing potential buyers and choosing the right person, or family, to give one of your puppies a good home. Look for people who are knowledgeable about your dogs’ breed, and who have the time and means to provide a dog with the best care possible. An ideal candidate would be someone who is passionate enough about the breed to participate in dog shows, allowing one of your puppies to reach its full, show dog potential. Screen potential owners with questions like:


”Why did you choose this specific breed of dog?”
”Who will be the dog’s primary caretaker?
”How much time can you devote to exercise, obedience training, and feeding a dog?”

, Convincing your puppies’ buyers to register them with the AKC is a step towards ensuring that your litter grow into show dogs. While the AKC funds many initiatives devoted to canine health, safety, and rescue, it also sanctions more than 20,000 competitive dog events each year. Dog shows shows can be a fun, educational experience for pets and owners alike, but a dog must be registered with the AKC to participate.

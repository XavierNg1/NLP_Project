 Cut notches, or curves, 2/3 of the thickness of the wood. The kerfs are located on the inside of the curve you are attempting to fashion. Be careful. If the kerfs are too deep, they may break the wood.









The key to kerfing is even spacing. Space all of your kerfs out as evenly as possible. Try to get the kerfs about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) apart.
Always cut across the grain. The chance that your wood splits is much higher if you cut the kerfs with the grain., This will be the shape of the wood when it is finished.
 Face the front side of the wood with a veneer or laminate. This not only will fix, or set, the bend, it will also hide the any cuts that occurred during the process.









If you want to disguise the kerfing, mix together glue and sawdust (or an appropriate wood filler) and fill the spaces left in the bent wood.

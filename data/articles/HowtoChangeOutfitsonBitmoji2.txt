 If you don’t have Google Chrome, see How to Download and Install Google Chrome. You’ll need it to use the Bitmoji browser extension, which lets you change your Bitmoji’s outfit on a computer.
 If you already have a Bitmoji button (a green icon with a white winking chat bubble) at the top-right area of your browser, you can skip to the next step. Otherwise:


Go to https://www.bitmoji.com.
Scroll down and click Get it on Google Chrome. It’s the large black button at the bottom of the page.
Click Add Extension.
 It’s the green button with a white winking chat bubble at the top-right area of Chrome.
 If you’re already signed in and see a list of your personalized Bitmoji, you can skip to the next step. Otherwise, use one of these two methods to sign in:


Click Log in with Facebook if your Bitmoji is connected to your Facebook account. You’ll be prompted to sign into Facebook if you’re not already signed in.
Enter your Bitmoji username and password if your account is separate from your Facebook account.
 You can choose either Bitmoji or Bitstrips style. Be sure to select the style you already use unless you want to change the way your Bitmoji’s face looks.
 It’s at the top of the list of possible hairstyles. Don’t worry, this won’t actually change your character’s hairstyle—it’ll bring up a list of other features you can edit.
 You’ll need to use the gray scrollbar that is directly to the right of the list of features. This will open the Outfit selection screen.
 You’ll see your Bitmoji avatar preview change as you click through outfit choices.
 This saves your selection. Next time you use Bitmoji in a chat or message, your character will appear in its new clothes.

 Rats usually travel the same routes and areas. If you place you trap in a spot that is in the middle of nowhere, or where a rat has no reason to travel, you won't catch it. If you are not sure where to place the trap, here are some common places to consider:Near your food pantry or garbage.
Any obvious paths, nests, or holes in attic insulationSpots marked with urine, droppings, garbage or footprints., If you do set the trap in an area where people walk through, or animals may roam, practice caution. Use a gate to block off part of the room so that family members or pets can't accidentally set off the trap and get hurt. Just be sure that you don't block the rat off from accessing the trap.
 Rats are nocturnal, which means they will not go in the trap until nighttime. If you don't find any signs of a rat the next morning, give it more time.


If you have not caught a rat after a few nights, try placing the trap in another area.
 When you do find a rat in your trap, be sure to discard it properly. If the rat is dead, put it in a bag, and place it outside in the garbage. You can either use a shovel to scoop it up, or put on gloves to pick it up. Do not touch a rat with your bare hands as they carry many diseases.


If you used a live trap, you will have to drive to a wooded area at least 2 1⁄2 miles (4.0 km) away, and release it., Rats come into a house through small holes and entries that you may not think they could fit through. Be sure to block off even the smallest slits along your trim, holes in the walls, or gaps around your house.Seal all food by putting it in jars or containers. Rats will not want to stay around if there is no food to eat.

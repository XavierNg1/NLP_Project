 The perfect pair of sneakers will look like they were made just to be part of whatever outfit they're worn with. However, since you probably can't have a closet full of sneakers, consider the clothes you have beforehand, so that you can make sure your sneakers match you clothes as much as possible. Once you have an idea of what colors you're looking for, proceed. If you plan on buying tons of new clothes in the near future, skip this step.;
, You've probably already gotten one in mind, such as Skaters. However, if you don't, Converse seem to go with just about anything. If you are open to anything, skip this step.
 If you've got a specific brand in mind (and know your size in that brand), then you would be better off going to that brands web site, since they will have a huge selection, and some (like Converse's Website) even let you design your own shoe. However, if you don't have a brand in mind, you're better off going to a store. Which store depends on what you want. Skaters? Go to your local specialty skate shop, if you have one. Running shoes? Head over to a sports shop such as Sports Authority.
 Fall in love with the first pair you see? That's great, but continue to look around. There may be a pair you like better.
 You're probably going to have to tie them. Make sure they fit well. Walk around the store, even run around it a bit. Check that there is room in the toes. If you are shopping online, skip this step.
 This works best with Skates and Converse, and not so well with Athletics.

 Most schools will have a tutoring center to help students in different subject areas. Schedule an appointment or come in during the time that the biology tutor is available. Tutors are sometimes biology instructors, lab assistants, or students who do exceptionally well in their biology class.
 Be selective when asking classmates to help you out. Ask the students who are doing well in biology as opposed to someone you’re friends with who is also struggling. You can ask for one on one help, or form a study group with several students., There is usually a student in every class who is eager to start a study group. If your biology class doesn’t already have a study group, be the eager learner and start one. You can even create social media pages that keep the group connected and let everyone know when and where meetings will be. Come to each study session with your notes, your book, and any homework problems. Ask questions and try to answer others’ questions., Your biology instructor can be your most valuable resource when you need help. Go to office hours or set up a meeting with your biology instructor. Use this time to ask them about the concepts or applications that you are struggling with in your biology class.It always helps if the instructor sees that you are putting in effort. Attend class every day, take advantage of optional study times, and participate in class discussions.

 Children do not have to feel like it's a burden to tell other children about their gluten sensitivity. Allow them to do so in a fun manner. Have your child invite their friends over and have a party where they serve gluten-free food. This can show other children how gluten-free options can be just as tasty as foods with gluten and allow your child to socialize with others while navigating their gluten sensitivity.If your child's school has Show and Tell, have your child bring gluten-free snacks and explain their sensitivity then.
 Keep the dialogue open when it comes to discussing gluten sensitivity and let your child know they can always come to you with questions. Provide your child with reading material that explains their sensitivity in simple terms so they can talk to other children and adults about the issue.It can be helpful to give your children specific phrases and sentences to use to explain their sensitivity in kid-friendly terms. For example, teach your child to say things like, "I can't eat foods like that because they don't agree with my body."
You can also encourage your child to share what their diet is like instead. For example, "We don't get pizza from that place, because it has gluten, but there's a great gluten-free pizza place we go to instead."

, It's important your child has advocates in their school and extracurricular activities. If your child is gluten free, talk to people like coaches, teachers, and other parents. Make sure these adults understand the condition as well. In the event your child struggles to explain their sensitivity to others, there should always be an adult nearby to step in and clarify.

 Find a level spot, preferably rocky (to avoid a muddy mess), with enough space for a four-person (or larger) tent and a large fire several feet away. It should also be near a clear stream or pond if possible.;
, Leave a 6–12 inch (15.2–30.5 cm) border around the bottom so that the tent will hold its shape better when assembled.
 Set it up the same as you would if it had a bottom. You may need to stack rocks at the corners of the tent to hold the poles in place.
 Find several large igneous rocks. DO NOT use rocks from a river or creek, as they WILL explode and burn your body badly. (see Warnings below)

, Build a large fire several feet from the tent (see Warnings below). Once the fire has built up a lot of hot coals, place several of the rocks in the bed of coals and continue to fuel the fire around them for 30-45 minutes.
 Make sure that nothing hot will touch the side of the tent or the people in it. (See Warnings.) Place a pan of cold water next to the rock ring.
 Use heavy leather work gloves and a pitchfork (or a sturdy camp shovel if no pitchfork is available) to remove the red-hot rocks from the fire pit and place them carefully into the rock-ring inside the tent. It's a good idea to sweep and/or blow on the stones to remove any ash, dust and embers that might go into the lodge and then into your lungs.
 Zip it shut from inside, leaving a small air hole.
 Pour water slowly over hot rocks to create steam. Repeat until the tent is hot and steamy. Enjoy your sweat bath for 15 - 20 minutes.
 (Optional) Exit your sweat bath and jump into a pool of clean, cool water and enjoy the marvelous cleansing effect. This may be the cleanest you'll ever feel in the wilderness, even without soap.

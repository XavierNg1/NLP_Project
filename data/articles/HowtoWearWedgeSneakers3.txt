 In order to balance out the weight and bulk of wedge sneakers, you need to add a little weight and bulk to the upper part of your body while keeping it away from the lower half. Avoid flashy belts or bulky dangle bracelets. Instead, opt for colorful fashion scarves, decorative hats, large earrings, and long strands of necklaces.
 While it is generally a good idea to add decoration to the top half of your body to balance out the appearance of wedge sneakers, you should not get carried away. Wear one or two of pieces at once, but do not wear them all at the same time. This is especially important if you opt for shoes that are bright are patterned, since the shoes themselves can act as an accessory.
 If you do have a pair of wedge sneakers in a color or print, avoid wearing hats or scarves in bold colors or prints that may clash with your shoes. If you have a bold leopard print wedge, for instance, you should opt for a solid color scarf instead of a scarf with bold polka dots.

 Blogger is a free service that comes packaged with every Google account. Blogs published with Blogger will have a Blogspot URL. Blogger allows you to create blogs as well as follow them. The blogs that you follow will appear on your Blogger Reading List.


See this guide for creating a Google account.;
, Following a blog will keep you updated whenever a new post is made. Follow your most favorite blogs, but if you follow too many you may find yourself drowning in updates.
 Many Blogger blogs will include a "Join this site" button. This will be available if the Blogger installed the Followers widget. Click the button to be added to the list of followers. You can choose to follow with your Google+ name, or you can follow anonymously.
 Once you've followed a blog, the newest updates will be displayed at the top of your Blogger Reading List. You can see your Blogger Reading List by logging into Blogger and visiting your main page.


All of the latest posts from all of the blogs will be displayed by default. You can choose to just display a certain blog by clicking the blog in the list to the left of the Reading List.

 Pour oil into a skillet and set the heat to high. Wait until the oil begins to shimmer., Pour the mushrooms onto the hot oil. Stir the mushrooms and toss them occasionally. Cook them for about four minutes, or until they are well-browned.Leave the heat on high unless the oil begins to pop, in which case turn it down a bit so that it doesn’t spatter.
 Reduce the heat to medium-high. Cook the vegetables for about forty-five seconds. Stir constantly, until the ingredients become fragrant., Pour in the soy sauce, chicken stock or water, and lemon juice. Cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until the liquid thickens to a creamy sauce that coats the morels (about a minute)., Remove the pan from heat. Stir in minced herbs of your choosing. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve the mushrooms as soon as they are cool enough to eat.For example, you may want to use minced chives, parsley or chervil.
 Refrigerate the mushrooms no more than two hours after cooking them. Use shallow, airtight containers or sealable plastic bags to store them in the refrigerator for up to three to five days.Freeze cooked morels by placing them on a cookie sheet in the freezer. Once they’re frozen, transfer them to a sealable plastic bag. Reheat morel mushrooms under the broiler in your oven until they’re crisped and heated throughout.If the morels have been refrigerated for over three days, look at them and smell them, and if you notice anything off, don’t eat them.
You can freeze morels as long as you like, but for the best flavor eat them within ten to twelve months.

 There are lots of different brands of hair removal cream, and lots of choices within those brands. When choosing a cream, think about your skin's sensitivity and where you plan on using the product.Some companies even make a waterproof depilatory that can be applied in the shower.


If you are using the cream on your face or bikini area, make sure you choose formula specifically for those areas, as the skin is more sensitive.If you have sensitive skin, look for creams with ingredients like aloe and green tea. You may also want to speak with a doctor or dermatologist before use.Depilatory creams can come in different forms, from aerosols (or sprays), gels, and roll-ons.A roll-on won't be as messy as a cream or gel, but the creams and gels let you control how thick you apply them (and usually the thicker the better).If you are sensitive to smells, try a cream that has added a scent to cover the eggy smell of the cream reacting to your hair. Just remember that additional ingredients can increase the chances of irritation.;
, Consult your doctor before using depilatory creams if:


You have developed rashes, hives, or allergic reactions to skin products in the past.You take a retinol, acne medication, or other medication that increases your skin's sensitivity.You have a skin condition such as eczema, psoriasis, or rosacea., Your hormone levels are always changing, and they cause your skin to change, too. Even if you've never had a reaction to the hair removal cream before, your skin's chemistry may have changed slightly and could cause you to react.Apply a small amount of cream to the area where you plan to remove the hair. Follow the directions, leaving the cream on for the advised amount of time and removing properly.If the tested area does not react in the next 24 hours, it is safe to use the depilatory cream., Don't apply the cream directly to any scars or moles, and if you have a sunburn, rash or cut, wait until you are completely healed before going ahead with the application.There may be tiny cuts on your skin if you have shaved recently--wait a day or two before applying the cream., This will ensure you don't have any lotions or anything on your skin that might interfere with the hair removal cream. Make sure your skin is dry afterwards, as most depilatory creams need to be applied to dry skin.Don't use hot water, as this can dry out your skin and may increase chances of irritation.Soaking in warm water can soften your hair, which may make it easier to break down. This is especially helpful for very coarse hair, like pubic hair.

 Countersink any nails or screws, and fill the holes with wood putty. Allow to dry and sand the entire surface, removing any paint or varnish. Clean thoroughly. This step is important as any imperfections, dents or high spots in the under surface can show through the Formica after installation.;
, Transfer the measurements to the Formica, don eye protection and cut, allowing an extra ï¿½ inch (0.6 cm) all around for trimming.


For small jobs, you can cut the Formica with a utility knife and a metal straightedge. Work from the back and score the line deeply. Cut again, and then hit the shorter end of the Formica against a solid surface to break it off.
For big jobs with lots of cuts, use an electric saw, again working from the back. Use a fine toothed blade to prevent chipping.
 Brush a layer of adhesive on the Formica back and on the substrate where you will be applying the curved Formica. Follow manufacturer's instructions for the proper adhesive and drying times.
, Continue attaching the Formica, pulling it taut and pressing it firmly to the substrate.

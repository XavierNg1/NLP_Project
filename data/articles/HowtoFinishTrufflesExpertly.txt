 If you have done so, the truffles will be in good shape at this point.;
, This will ensure that the coating sticks firmly to the truffle. Suitable coatings for truffles include:


Cocoa powder
Melted chocolate (dark, milk, white)
Chopped nuts
Layered chocolate
Desiccated coconut
Sprinkles
Decorative icing
Coloured sugar crystals
Glazed cherries or peel (a simple single fruit piece at the top of a truffle will appear very effective), or chopped dried fruit pieces
Icing sugar

, Coated truffles should be placed on a baking tray (cookie sheet) covered in baking paper (parchment paper) to set without sticking.


Use a flat bladed knife to slide truffles out of the chocolate dipping tool or fork and onto the tray.
If dipped in chocolate, leave any excess chocolate forming at the base of the truffle; once set, you can easily snap this away from the truffle as part of a final "trim".
 This should be placed in the fridge or a very cool place. Truffles stored in this manner should keep for up to two weeks.
 They can be served in dainty dishes direct on side tables or the main table.

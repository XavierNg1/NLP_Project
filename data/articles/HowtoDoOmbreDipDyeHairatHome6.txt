 Sometimes after bleaching dark hair, you end up with a copper or reddish tone. You need to use cool color to deal with the brassiness. You can try purple shampoo as well. If you have no problem with brassiness or gingery hair, you can just enjoy your new ombre hair!

, So, repeat the process again and make sure to apply the dye thickly so it will effectively cancel out the brassiness and the gingery hair!

, Again, put off shampooing your hair immediately so the color has time to set.

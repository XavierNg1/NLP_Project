To search for a friend in the contacts list, tap “Contacts” in the Phone app, enter your friend’s name in the search field at the top, and tap his/her name in the results.
 After you’ve entered a phone number or selected a friend to call, tap the green call (phone) icon at the bottom of the screen, and then wait for your friend to answer the call.
 As soon as your friend picks up the call, exchange pleasantries and tell him to wait for a few seconds while you call another friend to join the conference call.
 After asking the first friend to hold, tap the Add Call (+) icon on the screen.


Enter the second friend’s number on the number field or select him/her from your contacts list by tapping “Contacts” and tapping his/her name there.

 Once you have the two friends on hold, merge your calls by tapping “Merge calls” on the screen. The button will be in place of the Add Call icon.


Your calls to the two friends will be merged, and you three can now start chatting.
 If you want to add more friends to the conference call, make sure you merge the first two calls before adding a third friend. This is because after calling the first two friends, the Add Call icon will be replaced with the “Merge calls” button.


After merging the next call to a third friend, the “Merge calls” button will again be replaced with an Add Call icon.
Repeat adding friends to the conference call. Depending on your carrier, you can have at most 6 people joining in.

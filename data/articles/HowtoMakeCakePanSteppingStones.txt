 Before using the mosaic cutter, suit up with safety gear.


Place ceramic plates inside an old towel or pillowcase.
Hit plates with a hammer, several times until you’ve created the piece sizes you desire.
Remove plate pieces and repeat until you have enough to integrate into your stepping stones.;
, Place the pan on top of the contact paper and trace around it.


Cut out tracing and remove adhesive backing.
Place contact paper inside cake pan, sticky side facing upward.
 Arrange the pieces in a decorative manner. You want to press the pieces firmly into the sticky contact paper.


Allow enough room between pieces so that the cement seeps in between.
Check the design by removing the decorated contact paper and hold it up to the light. If you like the way it looks, replace the paper, sticky side upward in the cake pan.
 Mix concrete outside and be sure you protect your face with the mask and hands with the gloves.


Follow the directions on the concrete package to mix it to the right consistency.
 Cut a square piece of chicken wire that will hold your stones in place. The wire should be smaller than the stone size but large enough to provide traction.


Put wire aside.
 Fill pan approximately ¾ of the way, using your knife to spread the concrete evenly.


Press concrete down into the pan to ensure a dense stone.
Place chicken wire on top of the concrete, pressing into place.
Top with more cement so it fills the entire pan. Smooth with hands and/or knife.
 Make sure you leave it in a cool, non-humid area to ensure it dries completely.
 Turn pan over and tap the top to loosen the stone. Once the stone has been released, slowly remove the contact paper.


Sand rough edges and then use a wet cloth to smooth and clean the stone.

 It should be on the front cover, as well as the title page of the book. You will need this information to create a proper ASA in-text citation.For our example, let’s say our author’s last name is Brooks.;
, Paraphrasing means to put an idea taken from a source into your own words. ASA citations require that you put the citation information in parentheses. Let’s say that are example paraphrased sentence is:


“Bookshelves are the best for holding books (Brooks.” Note that there is an open parenthesis at the the end of the sentence, followed by the author’s last name.
Do not close the parentheses yet because you are going to add more information.
 It should be on the front or back of the title page. Add this date after the author’s last name, placing a space between the two.Let’s say our book was published in 2003. This means our example would be:


“Bookshelves are the best for holding books (Brooks 2003.” Note that there is a space between the author’s last name and the date, but no comma (commas are sometimes used in other in-text citations).
 While this is not always required, it is generally best to add the page number that you found your quote on. This will both help you refer back to where you found the quote, and will validate your citation.Let’s say you found your example quote on page 27:


“Bookshelves are the best for holding books (Brooks 2003:27).” Note that you separate the year and page number with a colon, but you don’t use spaces between the two numbers.
Also note that the punctuation (in this case a period) is placed outside the parentheses.
 In that case, you include the date and page number right after the name. For instance, you could write:


“Brooks (2003:27) noted that bookshelves are the best for holding books.”

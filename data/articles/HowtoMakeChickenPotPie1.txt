 Place the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and use a whisk to thoroughly combine them.;
, Place the chilled butter cubes and shortening in the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or two forks to work the butter and shortening into the flour until the dough resembles small lentils or peas.


If you have a food processor, you can make this step easier by placing the flour, salt, butter and shortening in the food processor and giving it a few pulses until the dough comes together as described above.
Don't overwork the dough, or the crust will come out too tough. Leaving larger pieces of butter will result in a flaky crust.
 Start with just a tablespoon of ice water. Use a wooden spoon to quickly work it into the dough. Pinch a bit of dough between your fingers. If it holds together, it's ready for the next stage. If it crumbles, add more ice water, mix it in, and test it again.
 Turn the dough onto a floured cutting board or countertop. Use your hands to form it into a flat disc. Wrap the disc in plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator while you prepare the chicken pot pie filling.

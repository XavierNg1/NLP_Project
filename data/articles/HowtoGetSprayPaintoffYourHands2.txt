 A much gentler, albeit more time-consuming, way to release pain from the hands. This method moisturizes instead of stripping the hands of moisture, as acetone does.


To remove spray paint from the hands with hand cream, simply squeeze a generous amount over the area that is painted and cover lightly with your hands. Leave the hand cream on your hands for a minute or two; then wipe it off with a cloth or paper towel. Repeat as necessary.

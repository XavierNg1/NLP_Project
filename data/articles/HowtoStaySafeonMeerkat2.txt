 Locate the app on your iOS device and tap on it. The app logo has a picture of a meerkat on yellow background.
 If you’ve used the app before, you won’t need to log in again. Otherwise, tap the “Log in with Twitter” button on the welcome screen.


All the live videos from the people you follow and from the Meerkat community will be displayed on your screen after signing in. Each of the videos has a preview snapshot and the broadcaster’s name.
 From the list of live videos, tap on the one you’d like to watch now. The selected video will be grabbed and brought to your full screen.


Know that what you’re watching is being broadcasted live. This means that there’s no editing or censorship available.
 If you feel that what you’re watching is inappropriate, you should report it to Meerkat. This will help keep the community safer. Tap the flag icon beside the name of the presenter on the top left corner, and a confirmation message will appear. Tap “Yeah” to report the stream.

 You can launch the game from the Start menu or desktop, if you created a shortcut there during setup.;
, Enter your username and password into the fields provided, and click “Sign in.”


After logging in, NFSW will initiate an update. As soon as NFSW has finished downloading and installing all the required updates from the Internet, a dialog box with a “Play” button will appear.
 Click on the “Play” button, and press “Enter” or any other key to start. This will load and display your NFSW profile details.


Click “Enter World” to enter the NFS World in Free Roam mode.
Free Roam is a mode in the game (and most other modern NFS titles) that allows you to tour the racing world to find races or other drivers.
 To form a group, you must use the Invite Friends feature on NFSW. To begin hit “O” on your keyboard. This will open NFS World’s Social screen.
 This is the Group List icon. If you hover your mouse over the icon, it will say “Group List.”

, Click the “+” button at the bottom of the screen. This will allow you to type the driver name of the friend you want to invite. You can find out your friends’ NFSW driver names by asking them to provide you their NFSW usernames.


Enter in the driver name in the field, and click “Send.” A notification will appear on the Group Chat window (found at the bottom left of the screen) saying that the invite has been sent.
When the friend you requested accepts to enter your group, their driver name will appear under the Group List tab on the Social screen along with your name, and you will thus have created a group!
To add an additional member, repeat Steps 4 to 6.

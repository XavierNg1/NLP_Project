, You can either throw it into a hot coal fire or put it in a self-cleaning oven for the same period of time as you would clean the oven. This will turn all the buildup into ash, and the pan will be like new again. Note: If you use this method - allow the pan to cool completely before touching. It could be hot enough to melt even a potholder. Let it cool first!

, Rub the pan thoroughly with this mixture with a paper towel until you have a clean paper towel. (This leaves a good finish on the pan, protects it, and keeps food from sticking to it.)

, Some people believe that iron pans should never be cleaned any other way, such as with soap and water.

 Differentiating your classroom’s learning structure can be an effective and necessary tool, but you should use clustered learning groups with care. Try not to designate groups that your students will easily identify as advanced, intermediate, and basic, or you might risk discouraging students who need a little more help.Allow the groups to be flexible based on a particular unit, week, or even school day. That way, the possibility of mobility and advancement will encourage students to do their best work.
 The goal should be to assign additional content that’s rich, challenging, and allows students to deeply engage subject matter. If your student finishes their math problems, assigning 20 additional problems as busywork will bore them, and potentially lead to behavioral issues.Instead of assigning, for example, more division problems, have them think of ways they can apply division to real-world situations. Instead of assigning more vocabulary words to look up, have them write a short story that incorporates the words they’ve already defined.
 Assigning rotating classroom maintenance tasks based on alphabetical order or a lottery system is fine. However, you shouldn’t have early finishers clean chalkboards, take out trash, or do other shores. This sort of busywork will just discourage students from doing their best., Try not to be tempted to have your early finishers correct tests and homework or explain the lesson to students having difficulty. Having a student teach a struggling student puts both students in a difficult situation, and potentially harms the self-esteem of the struggling student.Further, instructing a student who’s mastered material to teach others might reinforce their knowledge, but does not adequately challenge them or encourage them to learn more.

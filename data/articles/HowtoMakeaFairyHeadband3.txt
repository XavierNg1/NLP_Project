 Glue in place.



Cut a piece of tulle approximate 20cm x 20cm/8 by 8 inches.
Scrunch the tulle up by pinching the top and bottom centers of the fabric with your fingers and bringing it into the middle. Tie a rubber band around the center to keep the scrunch in place.
Wrap raffia, twine, ribbon, etc. around the rubber band to make it look nice.
 Allow to dry.
 These will sit each side of the bow. When done, glue in place. For details, see How to make tulle roses.


Alternatively, only use tulle roses all the way along the headband and don't use a bow.

 Allow to dry.


Instead of a sequin, you could use a costume pearl, a small button, a rhinestone, etc.

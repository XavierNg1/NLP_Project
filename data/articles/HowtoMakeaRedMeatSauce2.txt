 Add 5 tbsp. of olive oil to a heavy saucepan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add 18 oz. of meat and stir frequently. Before the meat has completely browned, stir in the celery, onions and garlic. Continue to stir until the meat is evenly browned on all sides.
 Add the crushed and peeled tomatoes to the sauce and cook them for about 10 minutes. Then add 8 oz. of red wine, 12 oz. of beef stock, salt, pepper and the bouquet garni to the sauce. Allow the sauce to simmer, stirring occasionally, for a minimum of 2 hours. The red meat sauce, or bolognaise, is complete and ready to serve.

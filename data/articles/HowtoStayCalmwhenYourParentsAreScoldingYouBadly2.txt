 Sometimes parents feel that a good scolding is enough to get their point across. Other times they resort to longer lasting methods such as grounding. If you are being scolded for something that your parents take very seriously, keep in mind that there may be an additional punishment.


For example, if you came home way past your normal curfew, then your parents might ground you for a week and also reduce your curfew to an earlier time.
 Try not to get upset or complain about the consequences that your parents decide on. The angrier you get, the more likely you are to make things worse for yourself.Remember to take deep breaths if you feel like yelling or showing your anger in another way.


If you truly think that the punishment is unfair, then try saying something like, “I understand that you want me to learn from this experience. However, this punishment will cause me to miss out on some of my best friend’s birthday party. Is there any way that we can compromise so that I can still attend?”

, Allowing your parents to discuss better choices with you will help tremendously. If they feel that you have made a bad choice, they will want to stop you from doing it again. The more receptive you are to talking it out and hearing their point of view, the less they feel the need to scold you.Try saying something like, “I want to make sure that this never happens again. What do you suggest that I do to avoid a similar situation?”

 2D is commonly used for the web to create small animations and 3D is used for creating movies.;
, There are many free and paid software s available for creating animations. Adobe Flash is the most commonly used commercial software to create 2D animations. There is a lot of free software that is designed for this purpose like Synfig. Autodesk Maya is a commercial software that is used for creating 3D animations. The free software s for this purpose includes Blender, POV-Ray 3.7.0 etc.. Try an internet search and find a software that suits to your needs.
 Whichever software you choose, there must be many tutorials available based on the software on the web -- at least on their website.
 After learning about the software you are familiar with all its tools and you might have practiced some tutorials also. Using that knowledge design a simple character(because you are just starting!). It can be a stick man, an animal, or just an imaginary character.
 You must have studied it when following step 3. Well, a timeline is like a storyboard in which it contains frames and all the characters movements are drawn onto the frames. A frame which has an object in it is called a key frame. An animation is created by playing a series of drawing one after another at really great speeds like 25 frames per second.
 Draw movements in each frame.
 Set up document properties and export your animation. Choose which format you want your movie to be saved. egÂ : .flv , .avi etc...

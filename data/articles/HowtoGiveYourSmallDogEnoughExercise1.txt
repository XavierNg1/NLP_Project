 Research your dog's breed for specific exercise requirements and talk with the vet for specific recommendations. It's important for your small dog to get exercise, especially to reduce the risk of obesity and joint problems. You'll also need to tailor the types of exercise to your dog's breed.For example, small terriers and toy breeds will thrive with a few 15 minute walks a day along with active games inside or outside the house. Small terriers will enjoy tag and hide-and-go-seek while toy breeds will want to play fetch.;
, While you can get breed-specific exercise requirements, you'll also need to consider your dog's age and activity level. Work closely with your dog's veterinarian to determine the right amount of exercise based on your dog's age.For example, puppies will require more exercise than a senior dog with health conditions regardless of breed.
 Watch your small dog for signs that it needs more exercise. If it needs more activity, your dog may become aggressive or bark because it's bored. For example, your dog might begin tearing up the furniture or barking at every person it sees if it doesn't get enough physical activity. Other signs your dog needs more exercise include:Running through the house
Playing rough (nipping or biting)
Digging, scratching, or chewing on household things
Whining for attention

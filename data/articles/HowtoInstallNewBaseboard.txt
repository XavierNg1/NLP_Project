Pry off the old baseboard carefully with a small pry bar so you can use it to mark and cut the new molding.






Protect the wall as you pry off old molding so it won’t be damaged. Use a piece of scrap wood between the wall and the pry bar.






You may be able to cut off damaged areas of molding and re-use part of the old molding.






Remove any nails that pull through the old molding and are left in the wall.

Using the old molding to make a template for corner cuts and cuts around outlets or other obstructions is ideal.






Make a template out of stiff paper or cardboard for difficult cuts if there is no old molding.






Molding pieces should end at a wall stud. Try to cut pieces so that you join two pieces at a wall stud.






Allow for the depth of both pieces of the molding when butting two pieces together at a corner.






If you have a miter box you can miter the corners (cut at an angle) so they fit together neatly.






Make sure cuts where molding will meet another piece in a line are perfectly straight to avoid gaps between pieces.



Make sure any flooring and wall coverings such as wallpaper or paneling are in place and any painting is done before installing the molding.






Work with one wall at a time. Start at one corner and fit all the pieces in place. Mark the backs of molding pieces if there are several for that wall in the order they will be installed.






While you are fitting the molding, look for studs to nail it into and lightly mark them in the area just above where the molding will sit.






The molding should sit right on top of the flooring.



Use finishing nails about 2”(5.1 cm) in length.






Try to get nails into a stud.






Place the nails about 18” (45.7 cm) apart or at each wall stud.

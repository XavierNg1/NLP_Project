 There are few restrictions on transferring items in the 2007 version of Runescape. Be aware of the following:


Accounts cannot give away any items or gold until the account is 24 hours old, or until the account becomes a paid member. Any items dropped will only be visible to that account. If the avatar is killed, only one of each item in the inventory will drop, including just one coin.Bots or accounts that use automated software may be banned. Anyone trading with them may be banned.
 You'll probably have to use two different computers to do this. You may be able to get away with using two browsers, such as Firefox and Chrome, but this will not always work.


You could get a friend to log on to one of your accounts. This is against the terms of service, and there are no protections to stop your friend stealing the account or items on it.
 As long as both accounts are over 24 hours old (or paid members), you can trade. While controlling one avatar, right click the other and start a trade.

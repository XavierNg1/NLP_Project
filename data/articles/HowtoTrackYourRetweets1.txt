 This site allows you to see where you rank among other Twitter users in terms of how many times your tweets are retweeted.;
, This will simply take you to a page that displays your account name, your rank, and your number of tweets and followers.


Click the “Tweet” icon on this page to send a tweet of your RetweetRank data.
 Under your profile information, click the button that says “Sign in with Twitter”. Enter the appropriate information when prompted and sign in. This will take you to your “Dashboard,” which gives you more advanced information about your tweets and retweets.
 The basic free service on RetweetRank is great for casual Twitter users, but if your account has high traffic, you may want to purchase a premium account. To do this, click on the “Upgrade” or “Pro” buttons on the Dashboard page. This will take you to a page that lists four different services ranging from Basic (free) to Business (pay-per-month). You can learn more about the different information that will be available to you with each type of account by scrolling to the bottom of the page. (You can also get a 14-day free trial of any of the different services.)

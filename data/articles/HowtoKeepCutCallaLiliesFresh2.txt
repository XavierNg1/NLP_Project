 Callas will do best in a cool room that isn’t too light and is away from direct sunlight or other sources of heat, like radiators.


Avoid putting them near a TV or computer, as these areas can get warm with extended use.
Keep them out of drafts.
Keep them away from fruit bowls, as ripening fruit emits gases that will encourage the flower to mature, shortening its lifespan in the vase.
 Aim to replace the water every day or two and keep it topped up. A steady supply of water is essential to the health of your lilies, and should never be neglected.


Mini callas will probably need additional water more often as they should be sitting in less water than regular ones.
 Some people like to keep their vase in the fridge overnight to preserve the life of their flowers – but be warned you need a big fridge for this!


It’s a bad idea to expose calla lilies to a gas called ethylene, which is produced by some foods, so only store your lilies in an empty fridge.
It’s probably best not to put them in a domestic fridge.
 The water in your vase will need a complete changing every day or two. This is to prevent any bacteria in the water from building up and attacking your lilies.

Callas will absorb a lot of water, so keep it topped up.
 Every second or third day, trim another half inch off the bottom of the stems. This is because the cells at the end of the stem will die.


Refreshing the cut helps exposes fresh cells and helps them absorb water.
Replace the water in your vase when you do this.
Remember to replace the flower feed or whatever additive you were putting into the water.

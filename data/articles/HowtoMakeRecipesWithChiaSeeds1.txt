 Using chia seeds with recipes that are grain-based will make the seeds less noticeable. Oatmeal, muesli, and other breakfast grains make ideal bases for a sprinkle of chia seeds.;
, Breads, muffins, granola bars, and other grain-based baked goods are simple receptacles for a few chia seeds.


If added before baking, the seeds develop a toasted flavor and may settle into the batter or dough. If added afterwards, do so while the baked good is still warm to enable the seed to attach itself firmly to the product.
Cobblers and streusels can easily incorporate a small handful of chia seeds with little noticeable impact on flavor, even for sweet dishes.
 Yogurt and ice cream can benefit from the nutty flavor and added texture of chia seeds as a topping.


If you prefer fruit-based jams or syrups with yogurt or ice cream, try stirring chia seeds into the fruit topping to blend them instead of sprinkling the chia seeds as a separate topping.
 Chia seeds can be used like nuts or sunflower seeds in regular salads. They can also be mixed in with salad dressing just prior to serving.

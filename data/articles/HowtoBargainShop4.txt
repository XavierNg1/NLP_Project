 One of the easiest ways to bargain shop for food is to simply make a menu for yourself each week. Then, try to stick to purchasing food items off your menu.


Include ingredients you'll need to make dinner each night. Try to keep it simple, like grilling up some chicken and vegetables.You should also plan for breakfast, lunches, and snacks. This way, you'll avoid the temptation to eat out for your lunch break., Incorporate sales items into your meal planning. If a particular item is on sale that week, consider making a meal with this item. Watch for ads in the local paper and online to see what will be offered for a discount price.


You can also look for substitutes that are on sale. For example, say you're making a soup that requires chicken broth. If vegetable broth is on sale, consider buying that and substituting it for chicken broth. Swap out ingredients for discounted items whenever possible., There are certain items you may be better of buying at dollar stores or drug stores. Milk, for example, is generally cheaper at a drug store or gas station than at a grocery store. Non-food items you may frequently purchase at the grocery store, like toilet paper and paper towels, can be bought for cheap at a dollar store., If a non-perishable item goes on sale, buy it in bulk. If you see cereal is marked way down, for example, stock up on 10 boxes or so while you have the chance. If items will take awhile to expire, it makes sense to buy them in bulk when they're on sale rather than paying full price for a replacement in a week., Many stores offer 10 for $10 sales, but be wary when you see items marked like this. This is often a trick to get you to spend unnecessarily. These sales are often not particularly good deals. If an item is normally 90 cents, a 10 for $10 sale isn't really a steal. When you incorporate sales tax on the original price, you're paying around the same amount.

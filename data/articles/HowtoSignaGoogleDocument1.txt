 Double-click on the document you need to sign. It will be opened in a new window or tab.

 This is your canvas for the drawing that you will insert in your document.
 A list of available lines to be used will appear. Select “Scribble” from here. Scribble will look like your actual signature since it will follow what you draw on your screen.
 Position your cursor on the canvas and start drawing your signature. No need to worry about its size for now. You can resize it later. What’s important is that you draw a signature that resembles your real handwritten signature.
 When you’re done, click the “Save & Close” button on the top right corner of the Drawing window. Your signature will be inserted where you positioned your cursor earlier. Your signature will be inserted as an image.
 The image of your signature may be too big. Click on it and dots will appear on its borders. Click and drag on these dots to adjust and resize your signature.
 Changes will be automatically saved.

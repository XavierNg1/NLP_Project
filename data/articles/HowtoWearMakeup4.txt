 Unless youâ€™re dressing up for a special party, or the Oscars, select a lip colour that naturally enhances your natural lip colour. If you have trouble selecting the right lip colour, pick a sheer tone instead which will allow your natural lip colour to stand out., Lip liner in the exact same colour as your lipstick can be difficult to find. Instead use a lip liner in a natural tone that can blend into any colour of lipstick you choose., Makeup for your lips comes in a variety of types, including lipstick, lip gloss, lip balm, lip stain and more. These various types also have different finishes. In the summer it is best to stick to lip products that leave a matte or sheer finish, rather than really shiny or glossy lip products.Keep the shiny and glossy lip products for summer evenings or special events, or for the winter.

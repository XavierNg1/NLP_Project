 This gives the hair a uniform look and gives the appearance of fullness. Hair should be cut to about 1 inch (2.5Â cm) in length. Or, get a crew cut. Longer styles can actually accentuate thinning hair. Trim hair on a regular basis to keep it from getting too long.
 This style is best for men with thicker hair on the sides and back and thinning hair in front or on top. A textured crop uses uneven layers to blend thinning hair with thicker hair to make thinner spots less noticeable.
 Blow dry hair while using a round brush. This will add volume to your hair.
 This popular choice works well on men with nicely shaped heads.

 The purpose of this is to have a water slide end up in a pool. Fill the pool with 5 inches (12.7 cm) of water to 2 feet (0.6 m). Any more will just end up splashing out when you go down the slide.
, This way the kids can shoot each other with water as they play on the Water Works. It is a good idea to position them so the water will never hit the sitting area or the food and grill.
 Every once in a while you can ring a bell and your kids will excitedly run closer to it to get soaked! This item is just like the big bucket on most water work attractions.
 For safety, consider removing the swings off their hooks so kids don't slip off them. Now enjoy an awesome time at your family water works, yours will truly be the best house on the block!

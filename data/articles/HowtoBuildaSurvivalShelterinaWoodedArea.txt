, It is very easy to get lost in the dark, and being separated from the area you do know can be even more frightening.
 Building your shelter in a ditch is a good way to stay out of the wind, but rain might make you wish you had dealt with a light breeze. It is also dangerous if you are in a region prone to flash-flooding. So keep out of ditches.
 It should be tall enough for you to crouch behind, and wide enough to accommodate your resting body.
 It is your most important survival tool. You will use it for your fire, your shelter and hopefully for making some traps for animals. Get anything you can find.
 As you are left with smaller and smaller sticks, start slanting them across the larger ones to avoid gaps. (Bear in mind that some gaps are okay.) Use enough sticks to make sure there are no holes otherwise, it will be hard to cover these with leaves. Do not forget to leave an entrance and an exit.
 There are two ways of doing this. If you are in the snow, pile snow up around it. Of course, if it hasn't begun to snow yet, you can't do that. Instead, cover your shelter with leaves. First, dry leaves. Then, wet muddy leaves if you can get them. This will keep your shelter insulated, and stop it from falling apart. Lay sticks on top of the leaves so that they don't blow away with the first breeze.
 Almost anything you can find has a potential use in building a shelter. A net may be useful for making a hammock (useful in warm weather) and rope has hundreds of uses.

 Make sure it’s something she enjoys. If she’s an antique buff, take her to a flea market. If she’s an avid outdoors-person, take her on a hike and a picnic. If she loves cultural events, take her to a concert or a play.You might even consider recreating a favorite family outing, like a trip to a baseball game, cabin, or theme park.
 Being a mother can be demanding and stressful. Give your mom the gift of relaxation and self-care by treating her to a massage, facial, manicure, and/or pedicure., If your mom is usually the one to put food on the table, give her a night away from the kitchen. Cook one of her favorite meals, or take her to a restaurant that she’s been meaning to try.
 This option will require some planning and preparation, but it’ll make your mom’s birthday extra-special. Be sure to pick a time, place, and date that works for your mother.


Keep in mind that you should give guests at least a couple week’s notice so that they can get it on their calendars and make any necessary arrangements to get there.
Since it’s your mom’s celebration, keep her in mind as you make the preparations. For instance, you should invite people that she’ll want to see, serve food that she enjoys, and play music that she loves listening to. When in doubt, consult with her about her preferences.
Remember not to leave the post-party dishes and clean-up for your mother!

 Shaving too often will not allow your skin the time it needs to heal sufficiently from previous shaving sessions. Try not to shave more than once every four to five days., Razors should be disposed of after five to seven shaves. This way, you’re always using a sharp blade, and less likely to irritate the skin., Shaving cream helps you get a smoother shave and reduces the likelihood of getting razor burn.
 Shave in short strokes.Don’t apply excess pressure; the weight of the razor should be enough to help you shave with the proper pressure. Always move the blade in the direction the hair is growing. If you pull the razor in the direction the hair is not growing, you might end up pushing hair into your follicles., Allowing your razor burn to be exposed to fresh air can help you get rid of it more quickly. If you must cover the razor burn, wear only loose-fitting clothes to allow your pores to breathe.Wear cotton clothes. Synthetic clothes can irritate razor-burned skin. Wool, similarly, can exacerbate your razor burn. Cotton, on the other hand, is a more breathable material and will accelerate the razor burn healing process.

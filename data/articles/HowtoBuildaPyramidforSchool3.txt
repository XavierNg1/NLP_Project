 This simple pyramid looks like a step-sided pyramid, with individual "stones" visible instead of flat sides. It requires just a few household supplies:


A box of sugar cubes
A piece of cardboard
A ruler
A pencil
Scissors
White school glue
Paintbrush
Sand

, Use your ruler and pencil to draw a square on your cardboard. This will be the base of the pyramid, so make it as small or large as you'd like. An 8-inch by 8-inch (20.3 cm by 20.3 cm) base is a good size for this project. Cut out the square when you're finished.
 Paint a layer of glue around the edge of the cardboard square. Position sugar cubes over the glue so that you have a sugar cube square around the edge of the cardboard.


You can use white icing in place of glue if you don't have glue on hand. Make icing by adding 2 tablespoons (30 g) water to 3 cups (384 g) of confectioners' sugar; stir until smooth.
Hot glue may also be used in place of regular school glue.
 Paint a layer of glue on the inner half of the first square of sugar cubes. Position a second row of sugar cubes on top of the first row of cubes, set slightly back toward the inside of the cardboard square. The second row of cubes will require fewer cubes than the first row.
 With each new step, paint a layer of glue on the inner half of the sugar cube square and create a new, smaller square by layering more sugar cubes on top. Keep adding steps in this manner until the sides of the pyramid have come to a point.
, Use a paintbrush to paint the entire pyramid with a thin layer of glue. Be careful not to damage the pyramid as you go.
 Try to create an even coating of sand over the entire pyramid.

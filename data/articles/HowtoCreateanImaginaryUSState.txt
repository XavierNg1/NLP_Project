 Anything goes! If you want, get a printed map of the United States and draw the state connected to it. Or just draw a map of your imaginary state.;
, Do not choose a state name that already exists or that is offensive, and make sure your state name is G-rated. Other than that, go wild. You can even use country names.


If stuck, use a translator site and translate a common word into any language which uses the same or similar alphabet as English. For example, a word translated into Spanish or Dutch is acceptable, but Chinese isn't.
 All states have nicknames (e.g. The Sunshine State for Florida). Choose a G-rated nickname that reflects what you want your state to be like. It's always in the format "The ______ State". Just fill in the blank.
, Are there mountains? Valleys? Wide prairies? Deep forests?

, Also add whatever other official symbols you want!

, Decide name, age, personality, policies, what part of the state he or she is from, etc.
 Include counties or parishes, as well as cities, towns and geographical features. Also include what it borders, if applicable.
, Rich or poor? Mostly young or mostly elderly? Immigrant or native-born mostly? Attitude toward outsiders? What kind of clothing is "in" there? What sort of house is standard there? Does the state tend to vote Republican or Democrat? Do they have a good school system? You can even make it so that the population was alien immigrants from space. If so, draw what they look like.
,, Include the death toll from these as well as the dates (month and day included) they happened.
 Go wild! Keep the Federal laws in mind as you go, too, since those apply to all states. Also include the punishment for breaking the law. The laws can be "It is forbidden under state law to possess peanuts in a Nut Free zone" to "It is unlawful under state law to buy red vinyl party balloons made by the Yay Toast company in Walmart on a Tuesday".

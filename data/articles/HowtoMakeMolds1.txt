 If you are making a mold for an object with 1 flat side, then you need a 1-part mold. For complex, 3-dimensional shapes, you will need to make a mold in 2 parts.

Add least 1 inch (2.54 cm) to each of your object's measurements before marking cut lines on your box. You'll need the extra space for the mass of the mold.
Out of foam core board, cut 2 walls for the width and 2 walls for the length, keeping in mind the object's height. Cut 1 square (width measurement by length measurement) for the floor piece.
Make a box by gluing the 4 walls together and then to the floor section with super glue. Again, if this isn't airtight, it won't do the job.

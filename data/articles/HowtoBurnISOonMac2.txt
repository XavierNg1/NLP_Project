 This can be found in your Utilities folder.
 The process is easiest if your ISO file is in your current working directory. Type cd /path/to/directory, replacing the /path/to/directory with the actual location of your ISO file.
 Make sure that the disc is large enough to fit the ISO file onto it. Larger ISO files will require a blank DVD or DVD-DL (Dual Layer):


0-700MB - CD-R/
700MB-4.7GB - DVD+/-R
4.7-8.5GB - DVD+/-R DL

, This will begin burning the ISO file to the blank disc, as long as the ISO file is in your current directory.

 If you have an existing compost pile, worm bin, or municipal compost service, adding your spent coffee grounds is easy.


Begin by gathering up the spent grounds as well as the paper filter if you use one. Paper coffee filters are also compostable.
You may want to keep a kitchen compost bucket handy for holding your coffee grounds until you take them to your compost pile. This will keep you from having to make trips to the compost pile each time you brew coffee.;
, Coffee grounds and filters are fully organic and can be placed directly onto a compost pile or buried in a worm bin.
 Coffee grounds are rich in nitrogen, which makes them a "green" composting material. Green materials must be balanced with carbon-rich or "brown" materials. If you begin adding a lot of coffee grounds to your compost pile, make sure to add more paper, dried leaves, or other carbon-rich materials to adjust the nutrient balance.

 You can locate a local pet shop on a map, through the yellow pages or just by asking someone. Check the pet shop out to see if they care for their animals properly and to see if they even sell quail in their shop.


The animals in the pet shop should be active, clean, clear eyed, eating and drinking, and they shouldn't be huddled up.
 If they do sell quail, ask them if they would like to purchase some from you. Negotiate the price if they want to purchase some cheap quails. If they refuse to purchase quail and you really need to get rid of your quail, consider giving them away.


Tell them the breed, age, colour and sex of your quail and consider bringing a picture of your quail along and showing them. This might encourage the pet shop owners to buy your quail.
Depending on the amount of quail they have in stock they might purchase your quail at a higher price or they might purchase your quail at a lower price.
 If you’re going to sell your quail to a pet shop you’ll want to make sure they look clean and looked after properly. You can clean them using water, trim their claws, and clip their wings.


Quail that are cloudy eyes, huddled up, panting, or have wounds on them are most likely poorly. You should get your quail checked out by a veterinarian if they show any of these signs.
 Before you take your quail to the pet shop, make sure they’re in a safe and secure container such as a cardboard box. Place fresh bedding in the box and poke some breathing holes in it. Be sure the quail aren't cramped up in their box so that they stay happy on the trip.

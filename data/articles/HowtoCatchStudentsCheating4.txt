 As a teacher, you will likely be able to recognize the student’s writing style. Watch for changes in writing ability, tone, and overall quality. Trust your instinct when reading student work. If something looks inauthentic, it probably is.


Search online for suspect passages from your student’s paper. Oftentimes, you’ll find the exact same passage in Wikipedia or another website.
 There are several programs that will detect plagiarism in written work by comparing the paper with other papers in the database and on the internet. Ask students to submit papers to online programs such as Turnitin.com or SafeAssign.
 A student’s paper, written excellently and eloquently, might raise your suspicions if that student does not typically perform so well in class. Invite your student to visit your office hours to talk about the paper. If the student wrote the paper, he should be able to talk intelligently about the topic. If he didn’t write it, there will likely be less confident discussion of the subject.You still may not have proof of cheating, however, but the student might recognize that you’re aware of their scheme.


Many students buy papers from “paper mills” or “essay mills,” which are websites and other services which sell essays for a fee. If your student’s paper is phenomenal, he might have purchased the essay from one of these services. It is difficult to prove this, however, so proceed with caution.

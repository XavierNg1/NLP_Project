 It is suggested that you use ingredients that are organic and raw as these are made without the use of harsh chemicals; however, that is not mandatory to get the same results.;
, In a small, sealable container, add one tablespoon of organic sugar., Add one tablespoon of coconut oil to the same sealable container.


If the coconut oil is solid, which often happens in the winter months as it get cooler, place the coconut oil jar into a bowl filled with “warm” water until it becomes a more manageable consistency.
 Mix the two ingredients together until fully blended., Using your fingers, scoop the scrub and apply to face and lips. Rub the scrub lightly into the skin for ultimate exfoliation.


The coconut oil has amazing hydration properties so leaving the scrub sit for 5-10 minutes would be beneficial but not necessary for the exfoliation process.
 This can be done over a sink or in the shower. Be sure to get all of the scrub off your face.


If you plan to use a washcloth, be sure to use a softer one as a rough washcloth post exfoliation could over exfoliate and cause irritated skin.
 Using a towel, pat dry face and leave it free of product until it is entirely dry.,

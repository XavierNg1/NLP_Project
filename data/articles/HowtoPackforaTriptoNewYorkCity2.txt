 The months of September, October, and November are some of the most pleasant months in New York City. The sun shines more often than not, but the air becomes cooler and loses its humidity. By November, nights can dip below freezing, while days remain pretty chilly., This means light, long or quarter-sleeve shirts, button-down shirts, and pants. Dark colors blend in and look good at this time of year.



For women: Combine a warmish dress with sweater-tights, boots, and a cute jacket. You can also try combining skinny pants with dark colored shirts, a tight leather jacket, and a scarf.

For men: Fashionable pants in dark colors (maroon, navy, black etc.) are good. Wear them with cool sweaters or plaid shirts for a good NYC fall look.
 In a city where fashion is a party of its identity, you may consider wearing your most fashionable peacoats or blazers, though you donâ€™t need to bring your absolute warmest jacket.
 On mornings or in the evenings when temperatures dip considerably, scarves and gloves come in handy. You may also consider bringing a hat.

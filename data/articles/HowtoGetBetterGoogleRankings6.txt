 All the social networking sites, like Facebook, Google+, Twitter, to name a few, give you a platform to create business pages classified according to category. You can build a social page for your business in each social media site to gather more customers.
 A directory links your website to other websites for traffic and domain authority, and lists them accordingly based on their categories. It has become critical these days to get quality directories compared to when one used to build thousands of links without any effort. With its sharing and commenting features, social media can help enhance your website traffic effectively, as these prompt the audience to visit your site.
 After creating the page, list all the consistent information, like addresses and contact number, in the correct format using dashes and parenthesis. For example, “Our company was established in the year 1993 (November 30th).” Here the date and month are inscribed in parenthesis just to inform the user but is not included in the flow. This will build a profile for your business and increase the trust percentage on Google when searching for the particular date, leading to improving of ranking.

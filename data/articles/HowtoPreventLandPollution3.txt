Choose recycled paper products such as notebooks, toilet paper, paper towels, etc.
Invest in reusable dinnerware
BYOB. That is, bring your own bag to the grocery store and other shops. Bring your own, reusable shopping bag. Many reusable bags are available at supermarkets and hardware stores, and several fashionable and reusable shopping bags can be found for more style savvy shoppers.
Boycott paper towels. Instead use rags and cloths to clean.



Buy re-manufactured ink and toner cartridges. Each re-manufactured cartridge keeps approximately 2.5 pounds of metal and plastic out of landfills and saves about a half gallon of oil.
Buy rechargeable batteries. Batteries are filled with toxic materials that are terrible for the environment, so go green by buying batteries that you can recharge. There are also special companies that will collect your old batteries and recycle them safely. It takes 1,000 regular batteries to equal the lifespan of one rechargeable battery. When you are discarding your batteries, recycle them.
Purchase rewritable CDs and DVDs so that you can reuse them from project to project, or write to a USB thumb drive or SD card.

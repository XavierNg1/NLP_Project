 Thirty (30) men draw random numbers to determine when they come into the match. Majority of the time, a specific number may be set for a wrestler (normally number 1 or 30). One year, "Cryme Time" traded numbers for the Royal Rumble.;
, The wrestlers who have drawn number 1 and 2 starts the match. Every minute and a half (90 seconds), another wrestler joins the match, until all 30 men have joined/been called. There will always be a 10 second countdown shown on the titantron.
 The last wrestler in the ring wins the match. Wrestlers are to be thrown over the top rope with both feet touching the floor, and witnessed by a referee on the outside. The following methods will not count towards an elimination:


If one foot touches the floor and the other foot sways around.
If a wrestler goes through the ropes and touches the ground.
If a referee doesn't catch the elimination, that wrestler may sneak back in.
If a wrestler goes through the ropes, leaves, and then comes back later on.
 A restart may be branded/approved if the last two wrestlers touched the floor at the exact same time or an official call can not be determined. If approved, both wrestlers then restart back in the ring.

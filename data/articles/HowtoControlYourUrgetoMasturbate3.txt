 Since your bedroom and bed are likely the most frequented areas for masturbation, it is important to control this environment â€“ especially in regards to sleep and what you choose to do in your bedroom.


Do not spend time in bed doing other activities such as reading, watching TV, or using the computer.
Stay in a standing or sitting position the remainder of the time (during the day).
 The urge to urinate can be mistaken by the body as the urge for sex/masturbation. Go to the bathroom before you go to sleep at night and immediately when you wake up in the morning. Even if you feel the slightest urge to urinate, relieve yourself as soon as possible.
 This way, you will fall asleep quickly after lying down in bed and not spend time in bed trying to fall asleep. Drink a glass of milk before bed if necessary to help induce sleep.


Go to bed early and wake up early if you can.Avoid staying up too late in the night; this can lead to boredom and increase the likelihood of masturbation.
If you have trouble sleeping at night and use masturbation as means for relaxation, try deep-breathing instead. Simply breathe deeply and slowly in through your nose and out through your mouth until you fall asleep.
 Besides, most masturbation occurs either in a supine (lying on your back) or prone (lying on your belly) position.
 When you wake up in the morning at the set time, get out of bed as soon as possible and avoid lying in bed awake. Such is a time when masturbation is likely to occur.

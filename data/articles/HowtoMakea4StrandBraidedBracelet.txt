 You can have any number, from 1 to 4. 2 colors is pretty easy to work with, but have fun and be creative. You can use muted tones for an earthier look, or bright colors for a more festive feel. For this example, weâ€™ll use black and blue strands.;
, To fit your wrist when finished, the strands should be slightly longer than the distance from your wrist to your elbow. You need 3 strands of thread for each main strand. Separate them into groups of 3 strands per color, like this:








, Tie all the strands into a knot at one end, and attach it to something secure, such as a monitor or a dresser drawer. You can safety pin it to your jeans, tie it to your toe, or tape it to something, as long as it will stay put while you work.
 Turn the blue strands to the inside, and cross the left strand over the right strand. It should look like this:








, Cross the right black strand over the right of the blue strand, and then cross the left black strand over the right blue strand.
 This is what it should look like close up:








, Cut off the excess string, but leave a little bit on each end so you can tie it on.









If you make it a little larger, it also works as an anklet!

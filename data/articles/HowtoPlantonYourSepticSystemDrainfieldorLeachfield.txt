 Some species of herbaceous plants have minimal root depth and only require a moderate water supply to flourish.


Most drain fields and leach have perforated piping that run anywhere from 6 to 46 inches (15.2 to 116.8Â cm) below the surface and heavy thick roots from the wrong type of flora can greatly inhibit or degrade the systems performance. Always consult an expert of what plants and shrubs might work best for your situation and do a little research before taking the plunge since digging up freshly planted shrubbery is not on the agenda.
Some plant recommendations might be shallow-rooted plants such as flowering perennials and annuals, turf grass, and other short root additions most often will not damage the lines and their root system is usually contained within a few inches of the base stem or trunk. When working with your drain field or leach field, remember to proceed with caution and carefully move the soil as you prepare for the additional shrubbery. Small trees and medium to large shrubs are possibly not the best choice for your drain field being their root systems might wander too deep and therefore interrupt the function of your field through root damage, soil shifting and excessive water absorption.;
, If you do have a requirement in your design to add trees or heavy shrubs to the drain field or leach field system, attempt to place the flora outside of the drain field perimeter thereby allowing the root system to develop and thicken outside of your systems footprint. If you currently have deep rooted shrubs or trees near your drain field, you may want to consider relocating them to another part of your yard or removing them all together.

 To make and distribute effective leaflets, remember who your audience is. A leaflet meant for a child looks differently than one meant for a 75 year old grandma. These groups have different interests and gather in different areas. Refine your message and strategies in order to appeal to your target audience., Smaller leaflets cost less and are less likely to be discarded. Give your audience the information they need without excess they won’t read. The larger the leaflet, the harder it will be for you to distribute. A leaflet that’s difficult for you to handle will also be difficult for readers to read and carry. Stick to powerful words in simple sentences., An effective leaflet typically has an eye-catching image or logo as well as a clear headline. Attractive color schemes draw attention. Bright-colored paper can help, as well as a bold, large-print headline. Snappy mottos or phrases stand out and cause people to remember your leaflet after reading it.For example, a headline that asks, “Need a local gardener?” explains the meaning of the leaflet very clearly.Gather leaflets in your area and study what makes them appealing. Find the design choices that draw your attention.

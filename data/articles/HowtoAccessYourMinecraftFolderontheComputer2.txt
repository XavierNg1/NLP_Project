 This program is called "Run" and it allows you to search things up on your computer. Keep in mind that you don't have to download it, it will be a default program on your computer.


Alternatively, you could drag your mouse to the top right corner of the screen and drag down to open up the panel. Then, click "Search" and type in "Run".

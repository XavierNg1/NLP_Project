 Gather a pencil or pen and a pad of paper. Find a timer—an egg timer, stop watch, or your phone will work—a set it for 5 or 10 minutes Settle into a quiet, distraction-free environment. Set your phone to silent. Avoid using a computer or tablet—they provide you with too many distractions!, Sit in a comfortable position and take a deep breath to center yourself. Start the timer and begin writing. Never approach stream of consciousness writing with an agenda but allow your thoughts to flow naturally from one to another. As the thoughts enter your head, record them on paper. Don’t avoid writing down the mundane thoughts or ignore the odd thoughts—these may have arisen from your subconscious mind. Don’t judge the thoughts or stop to analyze them. Just write. Continue recording your thoughts until the timer buzzes., When the session is complete, read over your thoughts. Reflect upon your words. Identify recurring thoughts or odd phrases. Try to find a link between two disparate ideas. Make note of any potential subconscious thoughts. As you continue to execute this exercise, read over your work from previous sessions. Trace your progress with stream of consciousness writing and assess if your unconscious mind has revealed itself.

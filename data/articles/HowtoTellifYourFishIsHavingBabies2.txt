 Many aquarium fish are egg bearers, including discus fish, bettas, and most gourami species. The females of these species lay hundreds of eggs, usually in prepared nests on the floor, wall, or water surface. If there is a male in the same tank, he may fertilize the eggs after they are laid or by mating with the female beforehand, depending on the species. The eggs will eventually hatch into live fish.


Look for your species name online to find out whether it lays eggs (oviparous species), or gives live birth (viviparous).
The females of some fish species are able to store sperm for months before using it to fertilize eggs, so a new tank with females only can sometimes still reproduce.
 Some egg-laying fish create nesting areas to keep their eggs safe. These may look like small pits or gravel mounds, but they are not always visible. Some gouramis can create elaborate nests made from a mass of bubbles, usually created by the male along the water surface.
 Some females of this species bulge as eggs grow inside of them, but this is typically not a major change and doesn't last long. Once laid, the eggs often look like tiny balls of jelly. These are often scattered to the water, but in some species they end up in a mound on the nesting area, or stuck to the floor or side of the aquarium.


Many egg-laying species also have mating rituals, including most gouramis. These are often energetic displays that can last up to a few hours, ending with the eggs being deposited.
 Caring for young fish, or fry, can be difficult, but even if caught unawares you'll have some time before the eggs hatch. Consult an aquarium store if you are interested in raising the fry yourself, since the process can vary by species. If caught unawares, refer to the section on raising young fish for basic advice, but do not assume the method will work perfectly for every fish species.

 These companies are typically selling low-quality tea at high prices. Although "wu long" and "oolong" are two legitimate spellings of the same word, for chance historical reasons, the spelling "wu long" has come to be associated with weight loss fads. The easiest way to avoid these scam companies is to limit your searches to the spelling "Oolong" and refrain from using the "Wu Long" spelling, but be cautious with either spelling.;
, Avoid tea bags and broken-leaf tea, which tend to be lower in quality. The best oolongs are only available in loose leaf form. With a few exceptions, you are best off buying pure oolongs, rather than flavored oolongs. Although there are some outstanding flavored oolongs out there, flavoring is often a way to mask lower-quality tea. Buying pure tea will also help you to learn more about the different types of oolong.
 Oolong is often classified by region, and the major regions are Taiwan, and then in China, Anxi county and the Wuyi mountains of Fujian province. A few oolongs also originate in other areas of China, and a few oolongs are produced outside of China and Taiwan. Only buy from companies that identify the source of their oolong.
 Oolong tea is roasted to stop its oxidation, and it varies greatly in its level of roast. Roasted teas tend to be darker and have a noticeable roasty aroma. Teas with a lighter roast tend to be more vegetal and floral in aroma. The best sources of oolong often reference the level of roast in describing their teas.
 Less oxidized teas, called "greener" oolongs, such as Bao Zhong or Jade Oolong, are more like green teas, and have light, floral aromas. More oxidized oolongs, often called darker oolongs, resemble black tea more in appearance and qualities, although they are often smoother.
 Experiment to find what you like the most.

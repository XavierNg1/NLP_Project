 With many products this is easy, since the product is inseparable from the packaging (as with lipstick and nail polish). If you don’t have the packaging you won’t be able to return the product., Sephora accepts returns within 60 days of purchase. Even if the product is used, you may return it. That means you can actually use up most of a product and still return it for store credit for the full value of the product.You may only return products purchased online via the mail. You cannot return them to a retail location.
You don’t need a receipt to return something to Sephora. Even if you paid in cash at a retail store, you can still return the item. However, they will scan your ID and save your personal information to prevent fraud and theft.
 You now have store credit to spend on a new product. Even if you actually liked the product you returned, don’t purchase a new one now. The salespeople will question why you returned it in the first place., Sephora keeps a record of what people buy and return. If they notice that you are purchasing and returning products often, they will eventually stop letting you return products.Remember: their return policy is meant to be a part of great customer service, not simply a way to give away free products.

 When you let an employee go, it’s important that you file this change with your state’s Division of Unemployment Insurance quickly and accurately.


This will minimize the risk of anything going wrong if the former employee files for unemployment benefits.
 Any time you hire or rehire an employee, it’s important to complete all necessary paperwork in your state.


This will help minimize the chance of paying unemployment benefits to a person who’s actually ineligible to receive them.
 If you appeal a determination to award unemployment benefits to a former employee, you must participate in the hearing.


If you file an appeal but fail to appear in court, benefits will be awarded to the employee.
 Failure to file and pay all wage reports and taxes may end up increasing your federal unemployment insurance liability.


To avoid this, and to ensure that a former employee’s eligibility for benefits are processed properly, be sure you file and pay your taxes quickly and accurately.

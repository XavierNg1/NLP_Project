 In a large bowl, mix 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of dishwashing liquid, 1 tablespoon of white vinegar, and 2 cups (236 milliliters) of warm water.Stir to combine the three ingredients.









Only use white vinegar for this method. Other vinegars (like apple cider or balsamic vinegar) can cause their own stains.
 Soak a clean rag in the vinegar mixture, then dab it on to the stained part of the carpet. The mixture will seep into the carpet fibers, loosening the stain.









Use a second dry rag to blot up the liquid as you go. Alternate between dabbing on the vinegar solution and drying it up.
 Now, soak a third rag in cold water and press it into to stain to dilute the wine. Alternatively, pour a little water directly onto the stain. Soak up the water by dabbing with your "drying" towel once again.









Repeat as needed. For maximum effectiveness, you may need to run through the steps above several times. Alternatively, you can follow this method with one of the other tricks in this article.

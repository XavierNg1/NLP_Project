 For this method you will need a few extra supplies, but the pipe is easy to make and the result looks more neat.
 Place the knife about half an inch below the stem and slice off the top of the apple. Take the stem out of the apple's top.


Don't cut off the top too close to the stem. The top of the apple will be made into the bowl, and you want it to be sturdy.
You may have to wiggle the stem out to dislodge it. Try not to damage the top of the apple.
 Use a spoon to carve a circular chamber out of the base of the apple. Run the spoon through the flesh around the edge of the apple, so that you create a circle about 1⁄3 inch (0.8 cm) from the edge of the apple. Dig the spoon into the apple to remove the flesh from inside the circle and down to about 1⁄3 inch (0.8 cm) from the base of the apple.


Don't get too close to the sides or the bottom of the apple when you're working with the spoon. The pipe won't be sturdy unless the apple has enough flesh left to hold its structure.
Use a knife to help you break up the flesh in the middle of the circle if it's difficult to remove it with the spoon. Score it a few times with the knife, then dig around the scores with the spoon.
 Hold the base of the apple in your hand. Use the pencil to carefully poke a hold about an inch below the rim of the apple. This will be the carb. Poke a second hole a few inches to the side of the carb to make a mouthpiece.
 Place the lid back on the apple. Fill the hole at the top of the lid (where the stem was) with the material you want to smoke. Hold the apple in your hand and cover the carb with your finger while you place your mouth over the mouthpiece. Use your second hand to light the pipe while you inhale.

 You can select a rap song that is performed at any speed. Sometimes it's best to start out with song that isn't too fast to begin with. Artists like Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent or Biggie have a lot of songs that feature a chill flow which most aspiring rappers can keep up with.
 Read over them several times while you listen to the song. Focus on the lyrics and remembering them perfectly.


Try focusing on the meaning of the lyrics or visualizing the story they tell to help you remember them better., Put the lyrics away and recite them from memory. Try to keep up with the music.
 Recite the lyrics from memory without the help of the music. If you forget the lyrics, start over and try it again. Keep going until you can get through the entire song.
 Rap lyrics should always be recited. Never read the lyrics when performing live or in the studio. Once you can recite rap lyrics from memory, then you can focus on performing the song faster.

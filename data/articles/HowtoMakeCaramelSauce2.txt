 The cream and the butter should be measured out, sitting next to the pan and ready to be added. Making caramel sauce is a fast process; if you are wasting time looking for ingredients when your sugar is burning, you're not going to end up with caramel sauce you'll want to eat.
 Turn heat on high and wait for mixture to start boiling, stirring constantly.


When the mixture comes to a boil, turn the heat down to medium-low, and stop stirring completely.
Allow mixture to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber. It should look like the color of dark beer.
 Mix in the butter into the sauce, then slowly and carefully pour the cream into the caramel, stirring regularly. Careful: the sauce will bubble up furiously!


Scrape the thick parts that settle on the bottom. If lumps develop, put the pan on the heat again, and stir until the lumps dissolve.
 The mixture should be uniform after cooling slightly and stirring.


Strain into a heat-resistant bowl or jar and wait until caramel sauce is cool enough to serve.

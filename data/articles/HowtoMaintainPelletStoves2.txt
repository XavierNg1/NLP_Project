 When starting a new fire and once or twice a week after that, pull out the ash pan. This sits behind the fire chamber and collects ash. Most stoves can remain operational while you do this. Tip the pan over a garbage bag and shake out all the ash. For whatever ash that doesn’t come off the drawer, use an ash vacuum cleaner.Never use your household vacuum cleaner to clean the stove. The ash will damage it.
 The burn pot is the bowl where the burning pellets sit. It has vents that provide airflow to keep the pellets lit. Look for any buildup of ash. If there’s a thick, brown substance or pieces of hardened ash called clinkers, remove them before use. Use an ash vacuum to remove loose ash, then use an ash brush to scrape off the hardened ash before it melts.Melted clinkers block the air vents and cause less efficient heating and more ash buildup.
 Inspect the rest of the stove. If you see any spots where the ash has gotten loose and begun to stick, use the specialized vacuum cleaner and ash tool to keep it clean. This includes using a chimney brush to clean the pipes.
 These are a series of tubes in the firebox that bring in fresh air and bring heat out of the stove. Depending on the stove, these should be freshened anywhere from every day to every month. Scrape off any soot with a wire brush. Be sure to get any clinkers before they melt.If your stove has a specialized cleaning rod tool, use this to scrape the heat exchangers.
 These parts feed pellets to the combustion chamber. Check these for accumulated pellet material. Use the vacuum cleaner then scrape out any excess with a sharp tool such as a screwdriver. Leftover sawdust or other pellet material creates a blockage that starves the stove of fuel.

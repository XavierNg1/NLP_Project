 Highlighting kits are available at most drugstores, but you may be better off going to a beauty store, where you'll find a larger selection. When you're considering what type of kit to buy, there are several factors to take into consideration:



The length of your hair. If you have short or medium hair, the kit you buy should contain a cap, a hook, and a brush. If you have longer hair, you need a kit that has applicators you can use to apply the highlights evenly as far down your hair as you'd like them to go.
The type of highlights you want. If you just want some light highlights, nothing too dramatic, choose a kit that comes with a rubber fingertip applicator that you can use to apply highlights exactly where you want them to go. For more dramatic highlights, you'll need a kit with a brush or long-hair applicators.
The color you want the highlights to be. If you want your highlights to look natural, choose a blond-colored highlight a few shades lighter than your natural color. Auburn highlights are also a great choice, especially if you have dark brown or black hair.;
, Plan to highlight your hair a few days after you last washed it. Using bleach and dye on clean hair can damage it, since the natural oils your scalp produces to protect the hair shaft have been washed away. Your hair should also be dry when you begin highlighting it.
 Set up a work area (preferably your bathroom) in a space with bright lighting and quick access to water. Put on an old t-shirt and have old towels handy in case stray highlighting solution gets on your skin.



You may want to wear a pair of gloves in order to prevent getting highlighting solution on your hands. Some kits come with a pair of plastic gloves for this purpose.
Put away items in your bathroom that might get damaged by the highlighting fluid - it will dye anything it comes into contact with.

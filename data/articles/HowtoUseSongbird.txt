 You can download Songbird for free.;
, Just run the installer you just downloaded. The default options are fine and not very advanced.
 There's usually a new icon in your Desktop or a new folder in "Start"

,, Add-ons are small extensions of Songbird's functions. Some add-ons are installed by default and can be managed with the Add-On Manager (Tools, Add-ons...)

,, The Library Tab holds all of your music. Just press play and start listening. Since Songbird is built upon Mozilla's libraries, its browser is very much like Firefox (try adding a new tab using Ctrl+T).

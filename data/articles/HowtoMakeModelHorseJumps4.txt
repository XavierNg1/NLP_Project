 Here are some suggestions for adding bars:, These can be arranged vertically and diagonally on a structure made from sticks, craft sticks or blocks of wood. If you want to make them very fancy, the ends can be colored with a marker.

Use pipe cleaners. Pipe cleaners are nice and light to use for bars. They can balance very easily off different materials and have the added advantage of being bendable and can be twisted, as needed.
Use ribbons. Ribbons from the scrap basket can be cut to any lengths as wished, and tied or held on as bars on a jump.

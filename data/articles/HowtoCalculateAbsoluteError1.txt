 The formula is Δx=x0−x{\displaystyle \Delta x=x_{0}-x}, where Δx{\displaystyle \Delta x} equals the absolute error (the difference, or change, in the measured and actual value), x0{\displaystyle x_{0}} equals the measured value, and x{\displaystyle x} equals the actual value., The actual value should be given to you. If not, use a standardly accepted value. Substitute this value for x{\displaystyle x}.

For example, you might be measuring the length of a football field. You know that the actual, or accepted length of a professional American football field is 360 feet. So, you would use 360 as the actual value:Δx=x0−360{\displaystyle \Delta x=x_{0}-360}.
 This will be given to you, or you should make the measurement yourself. Substitute this value for x0{\displaystyle x_{0}}.

For example, if you measure the football field and find that it is 357 feet long, you would use 357 as the measured value:Δx=357−360{\displaystyle \Delta x=357-360}.
 Since absolute error is always positive, take the absolute value of this difference, ignoring any negative signs.This will give you the absolute error.

For example, since Δx=357−360=−3{\displaystyle \Delta x=357-360=-3}, the absolute error of your measurement is 3 feet.

 Most falls and injuries occur with new or inexperienced skateboarders.If you have some practice under your belt before talking to your parents about getting your own skateboard, you can point to that experience to justify why you’re ready for your own board.


Start slow when learning how to skateboard. Ask your more experienced skateboarding friends for guidance and advice about how to maneuver and use the board properly.
Use the experience on your friend’s board to practice falling safely.
 Skateboarding really does carry the risk of serious injury to the body, especially the head and arms. Promise to wear all the appropriate safety gear, including a helmet, elbow and knee pads, wrist guards, and appropriate shoes.


Choose a helmet that fits snugly on your head. It should not be too tight or too loose, and sit low on your forehead. The straps should form a “V” around your ears.
Skateboarding is not recommended for children younger than five.
If you’re between the ages of six and ten, you should agree to supervision from a family member or trusted adult.
Agree to accept your parents’ safety instructions.
Promise to avoid doing risky stunts.Don't lie to your parents just to convince them to buy one for you. For example, don't say you will always wear a helmet if you aren't planning to once you get a skateboard. If you do this, your parents will probably just return the skateboard.
 Skating in the street can be dangerous, and skating in certain locations can be illegal.Do not skate in the street or use homemade skate ramps.Only use your board in approved public areas or skateparks.


If your parents only want you skating around the neighborhood, promise them that you will not go anywhere else.

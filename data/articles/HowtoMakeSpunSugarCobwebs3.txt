 With your other hand, hold a fork. You will be dipping the fork into the saucepan as you create the sugar spun cobwebs. It is generally a good idea to hold the fork in your right hand if you are right-handed, or in your left hand if you are left-handed., Gently dip the fork into the saucepan filled with sugar syrup. Make sure the fork touches the bottom of the saucepan before lifting it from the sugar syrup mixture. Gently raise the fork from the sugar syrup mixture.
 Using a circular pattern, quickly fling threads of sugar syrup across the bottom of the bowl your prepared earlier. Be sure you move the fork up, down, and all around to create a cobweb of sugar threads. Repeat and then let the sugar cool on the bowl for three to four minutes.
 Quickly and cautiously ease the cobweb from the bowl. Start at the bottom and use your hands to gently ease the threads from the bowl, shaping them into a sphere as you go. You should end up with a sphere of sugar threads.
 You can now use the sugar spun cobwebs to decorate your cupcakes, pie, or cake. Gently place the cobwebs on top of your treats. Enjoy!

 Home cleaning remedies can be excellent, cheap solutions to many problems. Skunk spray, however, is one of the strongest and most stubborn smells you are likely to encounter. Spending money on a specialized cleaning product is recommended for permanent odor removal, without without any undesirable side effects.


If you are not able to make a trip to the drugstore immediately, trying a different method first may be worth it, since the odor will be easiest to remove if you try as soon as possible. Light, indirect skunk sprays may also be removable with cheaper home remedies.;
, If the dog has red, irritated eyes, it may be suffering from painful skunk spray in the face.Apply cool, clean water to the eyes by pouring from a cup, squirting with a turkey baster, or pouring from a gentle hose without any attachments to the end.
 Be sure to purchase a pet-safe "enzyme based" or "enzymatic" cleaning product for skunk odor removal. Unlike other commercial odor removal products, enzyme cleaners actually break down and permanently remove the odor-causing substances, instead of just masking the smell under a stronger one.


Do not use a skunk odor removal product that does not specifically state it is safe for use on pets.
 Many of these products can be applied as a spray directly on the dog's fur, but check the packaging instructions first. There is usually no need to use water or soap, as the enzymes will remain on the fur while dry and break down the odor over the course of a couple hours.


Avoid spraying the dog's eyes or nose. If the smell is strong in the face, wet a cloth with the cleaning product and gently wipe the cheeks, forehead, and chin.
If the dog has long fur and received a direct hit from the skunk spray, the odor may be trapped deeper in the coat. Use a cloth soaked in the cleaning solution to rub the dog's fur right down to the skin.

 An HDMI cable is a high-definition connector that allows you to hook devices such as computers, consoles, and receivers up to your TV. If you don't have an HDMI cable, you can buy a high-quality one from most technology stores or Amazon for under $20.

If you have an HDTV, it probably has an HDMI input.
Your Mac should have an HDMI port on the right side; if you have a recent model of Mac, it should say "HDMI" next to the port.
 Make sure the cable is facing the right way--e.g., the smaller part of the cable end is on the bottom.

If your Mac doesn't have an HDMI cable, you'll need to purchase an adaptor. In this case, you'll need a "Thunderbolt to HDMI" adaptor to plug into the left side of your Mac.
 Your TV's HDMI slot will look like your computer's., You'll have to set your TV's current channel to an input; if your TV has multiple HDMI outlets, you may have to cycle the TV's input to get the right one to display. Depending on your TV model, you can usually do this by tapping the "Input" button on either the remote control or on the display itself.

For example, if your chosen HDMI port is labeled "HDMI 2", you'll need to press your "Input" button until you see the phrase "HDMI 2" on your TV's screen.
 This may take a few seconds; once the connection solidifies, your Mac's screen should show up on your TV!, If you've never altered your TV's display filter, it may still be on "Dynamic" or "Cinematic" from the store. To achieve the highest-quality picture possible, your TV's display should be set to "Normal" or "Standard" (contingent on your TV model). Consult your TV's manual in order to complete this process.

Your TV may also have a "Computer" setting; if available, this setting is ideal for your purposes here.

Do not use tender cuts of meat such as sirloin, because they may cook away or crumble into the chili.
Keep your choice of meat traditional by using beef or pork as opposed to exotic meats like ostrich or snake.
Do not use meat that contains gristle or large chunks of fat. Leaner cuts of beef will prevent large quantities of grease from forming in your chili.



Do not use one specific spice that will dominate the taste of your chili.
Unless the chili cook-off is a competition for the spiciest chili, do not allow spicy peppers to overpower the taste of the chili.


Remove seeds from tomatoes and peppers before you include them in the chili, because they will float to the top.






Finely mince all your vegetables to prevent them from floating around in the gravy.






Add gravy or seasoning powders to your chili to make it appear thick as opposed to runny.






Add ingredients that will give your chili an appetizing reddish-brown color as opposed to green or yellow, unless the cook-off is for a specific type of chili.



The ingredients of your chili will break apart or your chili will develop a runny or mushy consistency.

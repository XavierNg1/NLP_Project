 Soft light pinks pair nicely with darker tones. Dark tones, such as black, brown, dark grey, and dark wood allow the lightness of pink to stand out. For example, pink upholstery looks great framed by dark wood. You can also position pink furniture on dark tiled floors for an elegant and sophisticated look., Pink also pairs well with metallic tones, such as silver and gold. For example, you could pair pink upholstered dining room chairs with an ornate gold light fixture. This will help brighten the room and the gold and pink tones will complement each other nicely. Similarly, you could use a cooler shade of pink for a living room area rug and pair it with grey furniture and silver light fixtures.


Experiment throughout your home matching different shades or pink with a variety of metallic textures.
 You can also use pink as a neutral tone. For instance, paint your walls a beige color that has pink undertones. You can pull out these undertones by adding pink accent pieces to the room. For example, try pink drapes, pillows, pictures, or floral arrangements. This is a great way to incorporate pink in a subtle and sophisticated manner.Alternatively you could paint your walls a light pink and then pair it with more neutral furniture and accessories. This will allow the pink walls to appear more neutral.

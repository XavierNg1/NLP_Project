 Roast and mash the sweet potatoes. Mix in plain Greek yogurt and/or honey.Add seasonings to taste. Garnish with chopped, fresh veggies, such as scallions. Serve your dip or spread alongside crispy pita chips or flatbread.To make a dip, use one tablespoon of yogurt and 1/4 teaspoon honey for every 1/3 cup of roasted, mashed yams.
For a spread, use 1/4 cup yogurt for every one cup mashed potatoes, and omit the honey.
For instance, try adding a light sprinkle of dried chipotle chile powder and salt.
 Dice and peel the sweet potatoes. Select companion ingredients that go well with yams. Because yams have a thicker consistency than water or broth, the more cubed yams you add, the creamier the soup will be.For creamy soup, yams go well with coconut oil, carrots, ginger, and garlic.For a chunky stew with a base that has a broth consistency, try stew meat and chopped onions, tomato, and bell peppers., Look for a recipe for sweet potato salad. Alternately, use your favorite recipe for regular potato salad. Substitute cubed yams for the cubed potatoes.Some examples of vegetables that compliment sweet potatoes in a salad are green onions, red bell pepper, and kale.

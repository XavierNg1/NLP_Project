 Some people choose not to have a prosthetic limb, but for those who do, tasks and life can become easier as the transition occurs.


The amount of activity that you do and the goals that you set will help your doctor determine what kind of prosthesis is right for you.;
,


He will walk you through the use of your prosthetic limb so you can see how to put the limb on and how it is secured.
Your prosthetist will start you out with a temporary prosthetic limb until your permanent one arrives.



Your temporary prosthesis will have a simpler design than a permanent prosthetic limb. It will have a socket that you put your residual limb into. This will lead into a pipe that supports the limb, followed by an extremity piece that is designed to look like a real hand, foot or other limb.
Continue to wear a shrinker sock on a daily basis.
As your residual limb resizes, wear prosthetic socks to offer additional ply for a better fit.
 This can take anywhere from around 6 to 12 months.


If your prosthetic has a silicon liner, roll the liner on to your residual limb so that the pin is centered over your stump.
 Add additional socks if you need more ply to hold your limb in place.
, Speak to your prosthetist if you experience any of these issues to schedule an adjustment of the limb.


If your prosthetic limb feels heavy to you or feels hard to move, this could signify that it is attached too loosely.
Open sores or blisters that appear on your residual limb can signify that either the limb is on too tightly or too loosely. In the event that this happens, discontinue use of the prosthesis until you can get in to see your prosthetist. Also see a doctor to treat the wounds, if necessary.
Contact your prosthetist if when you walk, your residual limb goes up and down in the socket. You should have a snug fit and not one that is too loose.

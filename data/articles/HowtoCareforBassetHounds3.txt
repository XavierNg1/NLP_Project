 Basset Hounds were bred to have wrinkles because they collect tiny particles and improve the sense of smell. However, they can form buildup and chafing, which can both lead to infection.Clean skin folds two or three times a week with a cloth and warm water, and a dog shampoo if buildup is excessive. Thoroughly dry with a clean cloth.
Basset Hounds’ oily coats give them a particular odor. If their smell bothers you, consider bathing them once every week or two., Basset Hounds are heavy shedders, and loose or dead hair tends to build up in their coats. Brushing with a rubber dog brush at least two or three times a week will keep their coat healthy. In addition, it will cut down on the hair that ends up on your clothes and furniture., Basset Hounds require nail and tooth care standard for most dogs. Brush your dog’s teeth at least three times a week using gauze wrapped around your finger, water and, if desired, dog toothpaste. Trim its nails as needed, typically once every couple weeks.If your dog is still a puppy, you need to start nail trims and toothbrushing early to train them to allow you to do it. Practicing with your puppy when it's young will make it easier to groom your dog when it's an adult.
Don’t use regular toothpaste to brush your dog’s teeth because it may contain ingredients that are harmful to dogs. You can find toothpaste for dogs in the pet supply section of your local department store or at a pet supply store.
Using an electric grinder or hand file instead of clippers reduces the risk of cutting too much nail off, which can cause pain or bleeding.
If you can hear clicking when your dog walks, it’s due for a clipping. Its nails should rest at or just above the floor so the dog doesn’t have to put too much weight on the backs of its paws.

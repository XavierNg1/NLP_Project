 Each month, look over your finances and decide how much you can afford to spend on clothing and accessories.


Shop with cash, not credit, if you have difficulty staying disciplined. Take a pre-determined amount of money with you and leave your credit card at home.
 Opt for versatile pieces that you can use to create multiple outfits.


Invest in a pair of well-fitted denim jeans in a classic cut.
Purchase a few well-tailored shirts, especially shirts that can be layered over tank tops or beneath jackets.
Look for timeless pieces, like the little black dress or a knee-length, A-line skirt.
Buy neutral colors. Think black, gray, white, and shades of brown.
 Keep your hunger for fashion satisfied by permitting yourself to buy a few trendy pieces.


Know current trends. This will help you decide what pieces to invest in.
Look for bright colors and bold patterns to balance out the neutral colors in your wardrobe.



Keep in mind your body's problem areas and look for garments that mask them and balance out your body.
Know your sizes.
Look at a store's sizing chart, when available.
Study yourself in the dressing room's full-length mirror until you have a clear idea of how a particular garment look on you.
Never settle for clothing that looks "okay" on you. If you do not absolutely love the way it fits your body, put it back and try again another day.

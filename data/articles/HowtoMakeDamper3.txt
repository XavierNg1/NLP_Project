 You will need a dutch oven to cook your damper over the fire. You want to make sure the damper does not stick to this oven. Prior to cooking, dust your oven with flour or grease it lightly with butter or a nonstick spray. Then, set your damper on the center of the dutch oven., Once your dutch oven is secure in your campfire, cover the lid. Make sure you have a decent fire going. You should have hot ashes and coals in your grill., It will take the damper about 30 minutes to cook. Just as when cooking it in the oven, it should have a golden brown appearance. The bottom should feel hollow when tapped.,

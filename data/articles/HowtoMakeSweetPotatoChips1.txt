 Pour 3 to 4 cups of canola oil into a wok or deep-fryer. You may need more or less oil, depending on the size of your wok or deep-fryer. Just ensure that you have about 3 inches of oil in the bottom of the fryer. Heat the oil between 360 and 375 degrees F (182 to 190 C).If you don't have a wok or deep-fryer, you can use a wide saucepan to fry the sweet potato chips.
You may want to attach a deep-fry thermometer to the fryer so you can check the temperature as you fry.;
, Scrub one pound of sweet potatoes under cold water and peel them. Take a sharp knife and cut the sweet potatoes into slices that are as thin as paper. It may be easier to use a mandolin and slice them on the thinnest setting. A mandolin will give you more uniform chips.You may want to use organic sweet potatoes since you'll be leaving the skins on the potatoes. Studies on pesticides in potatoes found that pesticides are concentrated in the peel.
 Carefully place a single handful of the sweet potato chips into the hot oil. They should fry quickly and begin to turn brown and curly. Avoid letting the sweet potatoes fry for more than one minute.Avoid frying more than a handful of sweet potatoes at a time. If you add more, the temperature of the oil will drop quickly, so they won't fry properly.
 Use a deep-fry skimmer to scoop out the fried sweet potato chips. Set the cooked chips on a rack that is lined with paper towels and sprinkle them with salt to taste. Continue to fry the rest of the sweet potato chips in batches.When frying more sweet potato chips, ensure that the oil gets back up between 360 and 375 degrees before adding another handful of chips.

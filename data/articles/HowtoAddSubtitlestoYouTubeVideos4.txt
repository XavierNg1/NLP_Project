 Navigate to another uploader’s video.
 This button appears in the video player and will bring up a menu of video options.
 This will redirect you to the subtitle editing interface.


Important note: Not all video uploaders will accept subtitle contributors. If they do not allow them, then the “Add Subtitles or CC” option will not appear and you cannot contribute.,, Playback can be used to listen to the spoken line before entering the subtitles into the text area to the right of the video.
 Subtitles will be placed in the timeline where you paused the video for each entry. Click and drag the bar on either side of a subtitle to change its length.
 Click “Submit for review” and your subtitles will be sent to the video owner for review.
 You will be prompted to answer whether or not the captions are complete. Selecting “No” will allow other contributors to pick up where you left off before the final subtitles are submitted to the video owner. Selecting “Yes” means they will go straight to review. After your selection, press “Submit” to finish your contribution.

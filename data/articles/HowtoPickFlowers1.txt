 This is the best time of day because the flowers are fresh from the night's rest and haven't been exposed to a day of warmth.;
, If you're not able to cut flowers in the morning, the evening is the next best choice, as the flowers won't be wilting under the heat of the sun.
 At this time of the day the flowers will have very little moisture and will not last long when placed in a vase or bouquet.
 If you pick the flowers before this, there is a risk that they will be too immature to open their buds. And if they're picked well into bloom or towards the end of blooming, they'll fade fast on display in just water. Older blooms will drop petals and pollen everywhere, creating a mess in your house.


Blooms that are dusted with pollen are past their prime.
Exceptions to this rule include daffodils and tree blossom; these should be picked when still in bud. The warmth of your house will cause them to open quickly.

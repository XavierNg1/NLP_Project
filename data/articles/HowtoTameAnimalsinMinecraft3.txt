 Using cooked fish will not work, so don't cook it.
 You must always be holding a raw fish while taming, even during the approach.
 Do not run at it. Walk toward it only when it’s facing away from you. When it turns to face you, stop immediately to keep it from sprinting away.


There should be at least a 7x7 open space around the ocelot to prevent it from feeling trapped or scared.
Do not aim your crosshairs yet on the ocelot. When you’re close, remain holding the fish. Do not take a single step, jerk the mouse, or aim at the ocelot with your crosshairs to prevent it from getting frightened.
The ocelot will then approach you cautiously while maintaining it’s gaze directly at you. It will stop a few blocks away from you.
 When it stops, slowly and carefully move your crosshairs toward it and right-click while holding the fish.


The ocelot may emit hearts while eating the fish, but taming will only be successful when it turns into a cat.
An ocelot must come close to you voluntarily in order to be tamed.
When tamed successfully, ocelots turn into one of the 3 breeds of cats that follow you around.

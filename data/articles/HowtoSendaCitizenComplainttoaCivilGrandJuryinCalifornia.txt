 They are generally referred to as the "respondent," and the person making the complaint is the "complainant."

Keep in mind that county grand juries have no authority over state or federal agencies and private citizens, only county and local agencies or officials.Take note of which county the agency of official is located in.;
, The California Grand Jurors' Association maintains a list of websites and mailing addresses for each county's grand jury at: http://cgja.org/local-grand-jury-information.

Remember that grand juries can only investigate agencies and officials within the borders of their own respective counties.For example, the Los Angeles County Grand Jury cannot investigate an agency located in Sacramento County.
If you still can't find any contact information, call the Superior Court's clerk or jury commissioner for the county where the respondent is located for assistance.
 Some county grand juries even have online forms, and most grand juries have a mailing address for you to mail in your complaint.

Some grand juries have complaint forms you can use. Grand juries are not required by law to investigate any citizen complaint they receive, so you should consider using them and follow all directions to avoid your complaint being ignored.
 Follow all directions, if any, and be mindful of the grand jury's limited time. Keep your complaint clear and concise, and use appropriate and respectful language, as the grand jury is a branch of the court.

Include copies of supporting evidence, if applicable, and describe its reason for being included.
Include contact information for any potential follow-ups. Your complaint and personal information are confidential by law.,

Keep in mind that the grand jury will not usually tell you whether or not they are even investigating your complaint, and that the grand jury has a wide discretion in these matters.

 Preheat the oven to 350° Fahrenheit (176° Celsius). Grease and flour two 9 inch round cake pans., In a large bowl whisk the gluten-free flour, sugar, strawberry gelatin, baking powder, salt, and xanthan gum. Whisk until well-combined and the dry ingredients are properly mixed., In a medium-sized bowl whisk the oil, eggs, vanilla extract, and pureed strawberries. Beat until the egg yolks break and the mixture resembles a bright red color., Pour the wet ingredients in with the dry. Using a hand or electric blender, mix on medium speed for about two minutes until the cake batter resembles a bright pink color and is creamy. There should be no more flour streaks., Using a rubber spatula, scrape out the strawberry cake batter and pour it into both cake pans. Scrape the edges of the bowl to remove any excess cake batter off the sides., Place both cake pans in the oven and have the cake bake for about 40 minutes, until it rises and the edges are slightly brown. To test if the cake is done, poke a toothpick in the middle of the cake. If the toothpick comes out dry the cake is ready to be removed from the heat., Flip both cake pans on a wire rack. Leave the cakes to cool for about 10 minutes, until cool enough to handle and frost., Stack both cakes together with frosting to form a bigger strawberry cake. Consider frosting the cake with strawberry frosting, cream cheese frosting, or vanilla frosting. Decorate with sprinkles, extra strawberries, cherries, coconut flakes, and/or fondant flowers., Slice a piece of strawberry cake and lay it on a serving plate. Serve with a glass of milk if desired. Enjoy!

 Start with about 2 cups (473 milliliters) of Epsom salt and pour it into an airtight container. You can use more than 2 cups of salt to make a bigger batch if you plan on bathing with them more than once a week.Epsom salt is available at most pharmacies or in the pain relief section of most stores.
 Choose your oils based on what you want the bath to do for you. Lavender and peppermint work well for stress relief, while citrus is great to give you energy and eucalyptus can provide relief from congestion., If you also want some color in your homemade mix, a standard food-grade food coloring will do the trick. Pour of a few drops in with the Epsom salt and essential oils., Make sure the lid is on tightly, and then shake the container until the salts are evenly covered with the oils and food coloring. When youâ€™re not using the salts, store them in a cool, dark place.

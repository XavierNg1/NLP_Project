 Once you have the right ingredients, making hibiscus iced tea is easy â€” it just takes a long time. Start by putting the hibiscus in a pitcher and pouring in water. Stir briefly to combine.

If you're using caffeinated tea bags, cinnamon sticks, lime wedges, or mint leaves in your tea, add them now as well.
 Cold water takes a long time to absorb flavor from other ingredients, so you'll need to let your tea steep for at least 8 to 12 hours. Keep it cool in the fridge while it slowly picks up the flavor and color of the hibiscus.

Cover the tea with foil or plastic wrap to protect it from drips and crumbs.
 When the tea has gained a satisfying flavor and color, remove it from the fridge. Fill cups with ice and pour the tea through a strainer or paper filter to remove the flowers and whatever other ingredients you added. Your iced tea is now ready to enjoy!

For presentation, you can re-garnish each glass with cinnamon, lime, etc. if you wish.
 You can sweeten iced tea with sugar, honey, etc., but this doesn't work very well because cold water doesn't dissolve solids very quickly. A better idea is to use simple syrup, which can sweeten the tea right away because it is liquid. See our guide to making this sweetener for detailed instructions.

To make simple syrup, just heat equal parts water and sugar in a pan on the stove. Stir well to combine. When the sugar has completely dissolved, you have simple syrup. Continuing to heat the syrup past this point will make it thicker. Eventually, it will turn into caramel, which you probably don't want.
1 cup of simple syrup (made from 1 cup of water and 1 cup of sugar) will make the tea quite sweet. 1/4 or 1/3 cup will give a much more mild sweetness.

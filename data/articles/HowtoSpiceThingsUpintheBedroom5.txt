Example: “I can't stop thinking about last night. ;)”
Example: “Mmm you looked so good leaving the house this morning… I want to do dirty things to you when we get home!”

, If you’re feeling skeptical, opt for an erotic parody of a movie that you both like — at the very least, you’ll end up laughing at how bad it is.


If you feel insecure about yourself, watching a dirty movie may not be a good decision, as you may wind up feeling inferior to the people you see onscreen. This should be a fun experience, not one that leaves you feeling sad!

, Touching your partner in intimate but not overtly sexual ways can help build a physical intimacy between the two of you.


As your partner makes coffee/prepares breakfast, walk up behind him/her, wrap your arms around his/her waist or hips, and gently kiss his/her neck.
While you're out for dinner or drinks, casually caress your partner’s leg, moving your hand up as high as possible without it being creepy. This should give him/her a hint that you’re thinking about getting intimate.Exchanging massages is another great way to build arousal from touch., This is more commonly done by women for their partners, but men can do it too. Find a song that gets you in the mood, create a strip routine that goes with it, set the mood (candles, curtains etc.), and perform for your partner.


The striptease can be as simple or complicated as you want. The key is to be yourself and do something that makes you feel good.
If you’re funny and like to make your partner laugh, incorporate that into the routine; if you’re more of a slow and sultry type, do a slow and sultry routine.
If you can’t dance, practise taking off your clothes in a sexy way without having to do much dancing.

 You should still just have one blank page.
 To do this, go to Insert, footer, and highlight "appellate brief index style" and "appellate brief body style." When this is done, you will notice that both of these page styles have white check marks, meaning they will both have footers now.
 Click the box saying "page break" and below it, choose the style, "appellate brief index style." Also, click "change page number" and fill in "1." This will allow the numbering to begin at page 1, even though it will literally be the second page of the document (due to the cover page).
 Click the box saying "page break" and below it, choose the style "appellate brief body style." Also, click "change page number" and fill in "1."

, Don't trip. Put your cursor in the footer for the index page style (the second page of the entire document now.) Then, go to insert, fields, page numbers. The "i" should appear. You can then center it if you like. Put your cursor in the body page style footer (third page of entire document) and do the same. A "1" should appear.

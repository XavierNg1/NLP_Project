 The fabric in the front should hang down to your ankles. You will not need to do anything else with the front piece. It will just hang gracefully down the front of your lehenga.








Having a long, dupatta piece can help to define your waist, so this may be a flattering look if you carry more weight around your waist., Bring one corner of the back piece of your dupatta to the front and then wrap it around your waist. Bring this piece all the way around to the back again and then, tuck it into the back center of your skirt.
 Go around the waistband and tuck the loose portions of the piece your wrapped around your waist to secure them. This will help to accentuate your waist and keep the dupatta secure.

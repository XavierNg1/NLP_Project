 You'll likely want to store your wood close to where you're burning it for the sake of convenience. A storage shed, covered porch, the side of your house under the eaves, in a barn, or even a lean-to are all excellent spots.


If the location you've chosen for your firewood is somewhat distant from where you'll be burning, you may want to use a wheelbarrow or wood carrier to help transporting it.
Your wood doesn't have to be completely protected from the elements. Exposure to wind, sun, and even a little bit of rain seems to improve drying times.;
, Although a little bit of rain may help your wood dry faster, wood that is already dry can be protected with a tarp. Only cover the top Â¼ of your wood with a tarp to maintain good airflow and prevent decay., Being in direct contact dirt will cause your firewood to decay more quickly than it would otherwise. Dirt is the natural environment of many kinds of wood eating bacteria, fungus, and bugs. To prevent decay, you might:


Lay a tarp or a similar covering between wood and the dirt beneath it.
Place 2x4 boards underneath your wood to separate it from the ground.Layer clean gravel between your wood and the dirt., Some communities or regions may have special regulations for firewood storage. You can easily find out this information by inquiring with your local fire department as to whether or not your storage location is in line with local code.

 From any location on the YouTube website, you should be able to locate your username in the upper right corner of the screen. Use your cursor to click on the down arrow next to your name.


This will open a drop-down box with a variety of options on it.
You will need to be signed into your YouTube account before this option will present itself.
 You can find the "Inbox" link in the middle of the list. Once you click on it, you will be redirected to your YouTube inbox.
 Click directly on the subject of the message, not the date or username of the sender.


Once you do this, the message will open on the same inbox screen. You will see the message sent to you along with two buttons at the bottom of the message: "Reply" and "Delete."
Note, however, that this only works when someone sends you a video or a message. It does not work with notifications of comments made to one of your videos.
 Of the two available options, click on the “Reply” button to be redirected to the message composition screen.
 Click once inside the text box next to the “Message” field and type the body of your message there.


Note that the “To” and “Subject” fields are automatically filled in when you use this method.
 Click on the down arrow next to the box to the right of the "Attach Video" label. From the list that appears, select the video you want to attach by clicking on it once.


You can either attach a video that you uploaded or one that you saved to your favorites.
 You should review the message before you send it to make sure that the content of the body and any video attachment is correct. After this has been done, click on the "Send Message" button at the bottom of the composition page.


This completes the process.

 A dog name Yi Lu, your first sniff teacher, will be listening.;
, There is an arch at the top right, go that way until you reach the arch. Go through it.
 He'll ask you to find "Ring Fragment 1". It's not too far from the tree. (the small tree, not the baobab).
 He will tell you about enemies. Sneak up behind the snake closest to the cliff. Bark using the - button, for Wii.
, Your first herb will be the Yellow Flower. Between two snakes (near Baobab and Cliff) is the Yellow Flower. Get it and give it to Dr. Potan.
 Go back outside and you'll find the victory gang dogs throwing tomatoes at Francis. You bark at them and she wakes up. She'll tell you about their pranks. However, she is too nervous to tell you about the scent of the Blue Flower.
 You'll have to go back there again! Sniff around the broken bridge, and you should find it. Give it to Francis.
 Watch out for the bear and warthog (boar). Go to the bridge in Tree Woods, and go to the left path. You'll find a log. Help Goliath fix the axe.

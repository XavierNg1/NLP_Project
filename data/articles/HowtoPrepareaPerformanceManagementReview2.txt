 Based on the information gathered, use the standard review scale put in place by your company to rate the performance of the employee. Keep in mind that the performance management review is for the entire year; achievements that are almost a year old are as important as those attained last month.
 Dispassionately read the review you have written and be sensitive to the possibility that your own personal feelings may have swayed a fair appraisal. Adjust the review if necessary.
 At the performance management review, the employee should be presented with expectations for the coming year. Keep in mind that these should be long-term goals, if possible. Leave open the possibility that these goals and responsibilities may change during the year, but that changes would be discussed with the employee and noted as modifications on the review form.
 Be prepared to address the changes that should be made to the employee's responsibilities and to discuss performance rewards for the employee, such as pay or position increases. If the employee has areas for improvement, suggest formal or informal methods to help the employee improve his skills or job performance.
 Give the employee at least a 1-week notice for the performance management review. Make sure that the employee understands the nature of the issues to be discussed. Do not reveal details at this time, only mention topics to be reviewed. Reassure the employee that this is a standard performance management review required for all employees.

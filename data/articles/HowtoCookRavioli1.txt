If you aren't cooking your ravioli immediately, place into an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator.

Frozen ravioli should be used within 30-45 days of purchase., If you are storing the pasta in the freezer or refrigerator, take it out immediately before you cook it. Cut fresh or refrigerated ravioli apart with a sharp knife to keep the pieces from sticking together in the pot.


Do not try to thaw frozen ravioli. Put it into the pot while it's still frozen.

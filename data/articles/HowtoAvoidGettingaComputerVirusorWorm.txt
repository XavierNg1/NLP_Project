If the writing is odd or the attachment looks off, do not click it. Verify with the person that they intended to send you the attachment you received.
 Many email applications can automatically load images for convenience, but this can leave you more vulnerable, as images can contain malicious code. You should only download the images in an email from a trusted source.

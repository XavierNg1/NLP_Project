 If hornets frequently congregate your home, a bug spray called cypermethrin can be used. You use this spray by dousing the siding of your home and light fixtures. It does not kill wasps, but does repel them. If a nest is not near your home, cypermethrin can be a good way to keep wasps from bothering you. It is generally not toxic to people or animals, but it can cause indigestion for family pets, so keep it out of reach of dogs and cats. You can find this product at most greenhouses or hardware stores., Insecticides are sprays that works much like honeydew. They do not kill pests on contact but poison the colony when accidentally transported by one or two wasps back to the nest. If you suspect a hornet nest is close by, consider an anti-gel bait.


Spray the insecticide you purchased, following the directions on the container, in areas where you've seen hornets. Areas like house siding, lights, and plants are optimal. With luck, a hornet should land on one of these places and accidentally bring a dosage of the gel back to the nest.Usually, the colony is contaminated within 3 to 5 days. At this point, the hornets will either die off or abandon their current nest. If you do not know where a suspected hornet's nest is, insecticides can be an effective treatment option., Phantom aerosol is a spray that works on impact. If you've located the nest, spraying aerosol around the area should effectively kill the hornets. However, be careful. You may want to contact an exterminator instead as you do not want to risk getting stung. Keep in mind that phantom aerosol should not be used on living plants.

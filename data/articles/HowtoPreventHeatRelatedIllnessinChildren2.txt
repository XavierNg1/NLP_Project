 Remove a child's outer layer or coat when entering heated buildings or on longer car trips. If you are warm with a coat on, your child probably is too.


Remember when the child is strapped into a safety seat and gets hot, the child cannot easily remove his or her jacket.
 Avoid putting babies down with parents or siblings.


The fabric used in adult blankets causes overheating and suffocation more easily and extra bodies provide more heat.
 Resist turning up the heat in a baby's room because a baby or very young child cannot dissipate heat as well as adults.

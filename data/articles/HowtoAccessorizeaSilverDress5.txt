 Clutch handbags are feminine and classy. Select a simple, solid print clutch decorated with a few gemstones or another similar touch of sparkle.



If going for a slightly bolder look, choose a large silver or gunmetal shoulder bag.
A black or dark blue bag may also work, but could appear too casual to match well with your dress.
If you want to include black or color on your bag, it is best to do so by selecting a bag with colored accents instead of a solid color print.

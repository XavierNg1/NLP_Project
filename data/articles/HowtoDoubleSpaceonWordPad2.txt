 Before you begin typing, you can set the entire document to be double spaced so you don’t have to go back and change it later. To do so, first right-click and select Paragraph.
 In the Paragraph window you will see a Spacing section. Use the dropdown menu to select “2.00” for Line Spacing. This will make the document double spaced from your cursor’s position onwards.

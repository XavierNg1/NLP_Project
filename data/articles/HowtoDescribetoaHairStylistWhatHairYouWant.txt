 Is it long or short? Curly or straight? Thick, baby-fine or somewhere in-between?;
, Let the receptionist know that you'll need extra time to discuss how you want your hair. This is true even for walk-in salons.
 Find a hairstyle and/or color you like in a magazine or on the internet. If you are unsure of what you want use Google to search keywords like "popular hairstyles of 2012" or "short hairstyles". Also try searching your favorite celebrity to see different hairdos they've had. Ideally, bring photos of the front, back, and sides of the haircut you want. For pictures of the color you want, make sure the hair is down in the picture(it is hard to see the full color if the model's hair is up).
 Show the stylist where you want your hair to fall, how much you want cut off and how deep of an angle you want any layering (this last one is especially useful if you want a "V-cut" or any other sharp angle in the back).
 Don't cross your legs or slouch because this will cause your haircut to become uneven.
 This way you can watch what the stylist is doing and clarify any confusions before it becomes a mistake.
 This is the last chance he/she will have to correct any differences between what you want and how the cut looks. If there is anything you don't like, TELL HER. They want you to be happy so that you will come back!

, Now you can get fantastic hair every time you visit the salon!

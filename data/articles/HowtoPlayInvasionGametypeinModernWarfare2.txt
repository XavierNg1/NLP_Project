, Put time to unlimited, score to unlimited, this way the game doesn't end during setup. Put lives to unlimited.
 Let the defenders kill the other team ONLY to get kill streaks to defend with (nothing over Pavelow!), after they are done setting up the game begins.



Do NOT attack until the game is set up...

The attackers need to stay where they spawn until the defenders are ready, and should have a class with tactical insertion to not spawn at some random place.
Once the game starts, the attackers attack (duh) the territory and defenders try to defend.



the game ends if... the defenders lose all the territories, attackers all run out of lives, and if all the defenders all run out of lives.

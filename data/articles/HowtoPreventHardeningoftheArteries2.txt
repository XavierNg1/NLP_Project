 The chemicals in cigarettes harm your blood cells. They also raise your blood pressure, impair heart function, and damage arteries, increasing your risk of atherosclerosis. Whether your cigarette smoke intake is primary or second hand, regular or occasional, any amount hurts your heart and can lead to the hardening of arteries as well as to clots in the bloodstream. The best thing for you to do is quit entirely, which immediately reduces and eventually reverses your risk for all types of heart disease and stroke.Look for smoking cessation programs. Find out from local newspapers, churches, online, and by word of mouth where programs exist and seek them out. If you can’t find a convenient program, start your own group by encouraging smokers you know to quit along with you.
 Be aware of what things you usually do when smoking. Some people smoke while drinking coffee or alcohol, after meals or while watching television, or while in the company of certain people. Once you identify your triggers, take steps to change your behavior. If you tend to smoke during your favorite shows, for example, watch them at the gym while you work out or cut your television viewing altogether. Another strategy is to change your drinking habits by switching from coffee to hot tea and/or to avoid smokers.It’s important to ask for support from family and friends, especially from those who smoke. Ask them to avoid smoking in your presence. It’s difficult to quit if you see and smell it around you.
 Your doctor can suggest medically tested cessation aids. Over-the-counter nicotine aids like gums, patches, or lozenges give you small doses of nicotine and reduce cravings while you slowly wean yourself. There are also prescription nasal sprays, inhalants, and medicines like Bupropion and Varenicline that are used to treat the addictive and withdrawal effects of nicotine. Ask your doctor about what is best for you.

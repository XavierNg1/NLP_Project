 Build your own website or post on online pages such as Craigslist.


Specify in your advertisement what types of jobs you can do (home repairs, plumbing, electrical work, yard work, cleaning etc.), what you charge, and when you are available.
Provide multiple ways to contact you. If you can be reached by both phone and email, you might have a better chance at getting work.;
, Speak to nearby friends and neighbors first.


Tell them that you need money and are willing to do light housework and yard work in the area.
Ask them to tell their friends and neighbors too, and recommend your services.
Your neighbors and friends may very well end up being your first customers. Be sure to tell them to spread the word that you do good work when you're finished.
 The main reason someone might consider hiring you over a professional service is that you're a lot less expensive.


Ask for a small amount of money that you can live with, rather than a large sum.
A good way to estimate what to ask for is to set a low hourly rate, say $8 or $10. Also, prorate your work to the nearest half hour. In other words, if you work for 6 hours and 33 minutes, just bill for 6 hours and 30 minutes. That keeps things simple.
 Dress in clean clothes and smile when people answer their doors. Offer a handshake when you introduce yourself. Make eye contact.


Be sure to describe exactly what types of services you offer, whether its small home maintenance, yard work, cleaning etc.
Be willing to do jobs on weekends and evenings.
Return calls and job offers quickly and promptly.
 If you have specialized equipment you can bring, such as a toolbox for house repairs or a rake for leaves and grass, bring it with you.


Heavier items like ladders and lawnmowers can be left at home, but be sure to mention you have access to your own.
Don't accept jobs that you don't have the equipment to complete.

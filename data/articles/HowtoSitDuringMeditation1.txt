 This is perhaps the simplest meditation pose, as it doesn’t involve any bodily stretching or contortion. Find a chair with a straight back, and sit forward in the seat, with the balls of your feet resting firmly on the floor.Sitting in a chair is a good method to strengthen your back muscles, which will prepare you for more difficult unsupported positions.
If you find that it’s strenuous on your back to sit up straight without assistance, place a few pillows between your back and the back of the chair.;
, The wall will support your back and help you maintain a steady posture. You can sit with your legs crossed beneath you or extended out in front of you. Use whichever pose is more comfortable.If you don’t have a conveniently located wall, try sitting with your back against a heavy piece of furniture, such as a large bookcase.
If it’s uncomfortable to sit directly on the ground, use a pillow or folded blanket.
 If sitting in a chair feels too stiff, try kneeling directly on the floor, but with support propped under your knees. In this position, you’re still technically sitting (weight on your buttocks), but the knee support will make the pose easier to hold.To achieve the position, kneel directly on the floor. Then tuck a folded blanket or pillow behind your knees, and then lower your body into a seated position on the folded support.
Consider buying a meditation bench, This is a small wooden bench that allows you to kneel on the floor, then sit back and rest your buttocks on the padded seat of the bench.

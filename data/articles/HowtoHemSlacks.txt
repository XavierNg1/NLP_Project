Put on the same shoes you will wear with those slacks.;
,


You may prefer your slacks a little longer or shorter, but take care that the hem does not drag on the ground when you are standing nor ride up above your ankle when seated.
,


The zipper should be at one side and the middle of the seat should be at the other side.
The leg with the pin in it should be on top.
It can be helpful to pin the 2 sides of the waistband together to help keep the pant legs even while you measure hems.
Smooth the fabric of both legs from the waist to the existing hem.
, This will be your cutting line.


Move the top leg slightly to see where the chalked lines intersect the bottom pant leg.
Make a small chalk mark at the intersecting lines on the bottom leg.



Make sure the fabric is still even at the waist and smoothed out through the leg.



Use short, even cuts with fabric shears.



Fold half of the raw fabric in again, press and pin hem at 3 to 4 inch (7.6 to 10.2 cm) intervals.



Bring the stitch from the top of the fold to the fabric of the adjacent leg. Pick up only 2 to 3 threads from the fabric of the leg.
Keep stitches 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) apart while sewing a hem.
Tie off thread with small, short knots.
 Make sure the hems are even and smooth.

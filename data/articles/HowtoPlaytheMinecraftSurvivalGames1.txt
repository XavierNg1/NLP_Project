 In order to connect to the Survival Games servers, you will need to have a legitimate Minecraft account purchased from Mojang. You will not be able to connect to these servers if you have a hacked account or game. See this guide for detailed instructions on purchasing a Minecraft account.;
, To connect to a Survival Games server, you will need the server's IP address. You can find a list of all the Survival Games servers on the Survival Games website.


Servers are sorted by region. Choose the region that is closest to your location.
Many servers will be full. Find a server that has less than the 24 player maximum.
Copy the server address to your computer's clipboard or write it down. US servers are named "us1.mcsg.in", "us2.mcsg.in", etc. and EU servers are named "eu1.mcsg.in", "eu2.mcsg.in", etc.
 Log into Minecraft and start the game. Click the "Multiplayer" button, and then select "Add Server".
 In the Add Server screen, you can enter anything for the server name. Enter a name that can help you to remember what the server is. In the "Server Address" field, paste or type the address you copied. Click the "Done" button to add the server to your saved list.
 There's a good chance that the server you just added will be full. Keep refreshing your server list until a spot opens up, and then join the server. You will be taken to the lobby.


If the game is underway when you join, you will have to wait until the round is over to play.

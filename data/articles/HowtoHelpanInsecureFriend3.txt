 If your friend is complaining about how they look, do not automatically compliment them and tell them how great they look. Although you are trying to help, your words will not help your friend feel better about their appearance.This approach may backfire and make your friend feel like you do not understand them.


Instead of trying to cheer your friend up, listen to them and acknowledge their feelings.For example, if your friend says, “My hair looks ugly today,” you could say, “Yeah. Bad hair days happen to all of us.” That response is better than telling your friend that their hair looks great.
 Helping an insecure friend can be overwhelming and take a toll on you.If you are a minor, encourage your friend to speak to a counselor, trusted adult, or a parent. If you are an adult, suggest that your friend seek the help of a professional therapist.


It is never too soon to suggest that your friend seek some outside help.
You may say, “Hey, have you ever tried talking to someone about how you feel. I think it could really help you.”Your friend will need to see a counselor if they are engaging in self-harm, abusing drugs or alcohol, has an eating disorder, or seems to be depressed.
 You probably think your friend is wonderful and has no reason to be insecure. However, that does not change how your friend feels. Always acknowledge your friend’s feelings. Let your friend know if you have experienced anything similar.


You may say, “I understand that” or “I know how hard that can be.”
Your job is to support your friend and show them that you understand and accept them.

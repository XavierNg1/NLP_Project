 Gerbils can mate frequently. A female can be in heat every 6 weeks for 4 day periods. If she is with a male partner and not mating you should check for pregnancy. You’ll have to wait about a week to notice any visible body changes. Hold a piece of food or seed above the female’s head after a 2-3 week period to find the bulge in her belly., You’ll observe increases in weight of the female gerbil as she carries her litter. Weight the gerbil in a small pet scale or ask your veterinarian to do it. Either way, re-weight the gerbil every 10 days., The gerbil parents will want more privacy and female will require more nutrition during the pregnancy. Acquire a hideaway from a pet store, and provide extra tissues for bedding to let the gerbils build a nest. You can also put up a cloth or paper as a privacy drape on their cage. Check the food that you are providing for them is balanced for pregnant gerbils. It should have at least 18 percent protein., Birth usually will happen at night and can take a couple of hours. The gerbil will stretch until the baby is about to come out, reach to help it out, and then bite and eat the placenta. The babies will be born hairless, blind, deaf, and helpless. They will depend on their parents for weening for 21-35 days. Try to disturb this process as little as possible for a couple of weeks except for changing food, water, and overly wet bedding.Don’t be surprised to see the two parents mate again right away. The male will then often get expelled from the hideaway for a few days before the female lets him help with the babies.
Cannibalism is a concern with gerbil mothers and their babies. This is rare and usually only occurs with dead babies or if the mother is highly disturbed or sick.

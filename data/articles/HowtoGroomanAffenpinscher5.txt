 In general, dogs only need bathed once every few months. When you do bathe your dog, place it in a basin, laundry tub, or the bath tub. Make sure whatever you decide to use has a slip-resistant bottom so your dog is not sliding around. If it does not already, you can get a slip-resistant mat to put down., Use a hose attachment to wet your dog’s entire coat with warm water. You can also use a bucket to pour water over it if you do not have a hose attachment. Make sure that its entire coat, including the layers closest to the skin are saturated with water.


When wetting your dog’s face, place the sprayer close to the skin so you are spraying just the areas you need to wet, not in its eyes, nose, or ears., Once your dog’s coat is saturated, apply an all-purpose dog shampoo all over its body. Use your hands to work the shampoo into a lather, making sure to get the underlying layers of the coat. When shampooing its head, be careful you don’t get shampoo in its eyes, ears, or nose. It is a good idea to use a tearless shampoo on your dog’s face, just in case., Finally, rinse your dog’s coat using the hose attachment or buckets of water. Work your hands through its coat to help work the shampoo out. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. When rinsing around your dog’s face, hold the sprayer or bucket close to its skin so you can better control where the water is going., Once all the shampoo is rinsed out, use a towel to squeeze as much excess moisture from the coat as possible. Then use a hair dryer to finish drying your dog’s coat. Put the hair dryer on a medium heat setting and hold it at least six inches away from the dog at all times. Brush your dog’s hair in the direction it naturally lays while you blow dry it.

 It may seem obvious, but a common mistake that's often made when connecting to the internet is not making sure the source of the internet is on. Especially if you've just set up a router and/or modem, ensure that it's on and that everything is plugged in properly, and that any lights on it aren't indicating that there are problems. Cords can also be unplugged or slightly pulled out of the wall, rendering the operation futile. Make sure that everything is plugged in properly and is working right before getting started.
 Devices like smartphones, mobile tablets, iPods, handheld gaming systems, and so forth can usually only connect to Wi-Fi services, due to the portable nature of them. Therefore, you won't be able to connect a mobile device to ethernet or to a dial-up network. Ethernet and dial-up connections are limited to computers and non-portable gaming devices (not covered in this article).
 Regardless of what operating system or device you're using, you'll probably need to access your network settings at some point in the process. The process is slightly different for every device, but the general path that you'll need to take to access your network settings is usually the same, depending on the OS. Some common devices or operating systems, and their paths to the settings, are listed below.

 To start, add the tomatoes, sugar, vinegar, water, salt, garlic, and pepper to a 2 to 2 and a half pound sauce pan. Mix everything together until you have an even mixture throughout., Bring all the ingredients to a simmer over medium heat and then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pan and let everything simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes.Remove the lid to stir every few minutes.
 After 10 or 15 minutes have passed, remove the garlic. Then, add the thyme and allow the mixture to simmer covered again. As you did before, stir the mixture every few minutes.Keep simmering your mixtures, stirring in on occasion, until the mixture has thickened into a jam-like consistency.
It should take between 25 and 40 minutes for the mixture to thicken appropriately.
 Cool the jam until it's no longer too hot to touch. Place your jam into sealable airtight containers. You can store your jam in the fridge. It should keep up to a week.

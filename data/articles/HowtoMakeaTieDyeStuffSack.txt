 For the tie dye to work, this sack should be 100% cotton. This will be your stuff sack. It looks pretty boring now, but just wait!;
, This is where you will tie dye your stuff sack. Fill squirt bottles with the colors of dye you wish to use and make sure plenty of rubber bands are available.
 Pick up the sack and dunk it in the bucket. Wring it out a few times until it is mostly dry. Then, lay it out on the table.
 You can roll it up and place several rubber bands along it, almost like stripes on a caterpillar. This will create colorful stripes. You can also twist it up from the middle and wrap rubber bands around the twisted wad, or you can invent your own design. Make sure the rubber bands are good and tight.
 Keep in mind that you don't need to cover the whole section with solid color. In fact, the blotchier, the better.
 Once it is dry, wash it in the washing machine by itself to ensure that the dye is more or less permanent. Make sure the sack is thoroughly dry before you continue.
 The slits should be about 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) tall.
 This is your "threading needle".
 Make sure the thread doesn't come untied!

, Voila! Your sack has a drawstring!

, When you use permanent markers, this will prevent the ink from leaking through.

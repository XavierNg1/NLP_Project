 Wrap twine around the handle of the colander, making sure to wrap the twine tightly to avoid gaps. Secure the twine by tying it and adding a little glue. Repeat the same process on the colander’s other handle.Place sheet moss inside the colander to line it.
Fill the colander with potting soil, then plant ferns and pansies inside.
Attach four lengths of twine to the colander handles, then use the twine to hang the colander in a sunny spot.;
, To complete this project, you will need a pair of old rain boots, a metal grommet, some burlap ribbon and two cylindrical vases. Install a grommet into the back of each boot, using a hammer.Thread a piece of burlap ribbon through both grommets.
Place a 3-inch-wide vase in each boot and fill the vases with flowers.
If the vases seem unstable, pack the bottom of the boots with tissue paper.
Tie the ends of the ribbon into a knot, then hang the display from a nail in your front door.
Grommets can be purchased at any hardware store.
 Take a handkerchief and use sewing scissors to cut out a four-inch square. Place the square pattern side up, then fold three of the corners inward, towards the square’s center.Sew the three sides together to create a pouch that looks like an envelope.
Turn the sachet inside out and press it with an iron.
Sew a button on the flap (this will be strictly decorative).
Pour dried lavender or other dried flowers into the pouch, then sew the flap shut.

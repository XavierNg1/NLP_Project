 After receiving an autograph on a baseball, make sure nothing touches the ink for at least 1 hour.;
, Repeatedly touching, gripping and handling your signed baseball can result in smearing the ink of the autograph, even after it has dried. Oil emitted from your hands onto the baseball can fade the autograph.
 Not only will this prevent you and others from handling the ball too much, it will protect the autograph from ultraviolet rays that can damage both your baseball and it's autograph through over extended exposure.



Display or store your baseballs in a room around 75 degrees F (23.89 C) with about 50% humidity. Any room hotter (like an attic) or with more humidity (like a basement) could affect the signature, making it fade or run. A hot or humid environment also could damage the baseball itself over an extended period of time.
Place your baseballs on display away from as much light as possible. Natural light can fade a signature on a baseball quickly. Also, do not shine a light directly on a baseball as this, too, can fade a signature. Any lights in the room should be indirect, and not shine directly on the baseball.

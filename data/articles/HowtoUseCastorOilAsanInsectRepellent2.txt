 Under normal conditions, you’ll probably have to reapply your repellent after about an hour. Alternately, if insects start buzzing about you, you’ll know it’s time to reapply your castor oil-based insect repellent.Always reapply castor oil-based insect repellent after swimming or exercise.
 Do not apply repellents beneath clothing.Doing so could lead to overexposure or over-absorption of the repellent’s active ingredients.For the same reason, do not use castor oil as an insect repellent on cuts, wounds, or areas of irritated skin.
 Do not spray your insect repellent directly on your face. If you wish to apply an insect repellent to your face, spray a bit onto your hand, then wipe your hand across the area you wish to protect from insects.Additionally, never apply insect repellents to the eyes or mouth.
 Castor oil is a purgative and can cause diarrhea and dehydration. Therefore, children younger than three years old, children who might rub their eyes, children who might lick their skin (where the repellent has been applied), and children who might put their hands in their mouths should not be sprayed with a castor oil-based insect repellent.Use castor oil as an insect repellent sparingly on older children, too. Spray a bit of the insect repellent on your hands, then apply it carefully to your child’s face. Wash your hands afterwards.
Do not apply the insect repellent to your child’s hands, because children often place their hands in their mouths and eyes.

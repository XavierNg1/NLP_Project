 If you aren’t sure that the nonprofit has committed a crime—but you suspect that it is running a scam charity—then you might want to report the charity to the Better Business Bureau (BBB). You can go to the Online Complaint System page.On that page, you can select “charity.”


You will then be asked whether the charity is one that solicits nationally. The reporting process differs depending on whether the charity is national or local.
 If you are reporting a national charity, then you will be asked for the following information:your name and contact information, unless you want to remain anonymous
charity name and contact information
details about your complaint

, You will have to provide more information to report a charity that doesn’t solicit nationally. Instead, you will need to search for the charity’s name by entering its address, URL, phone number, or email address.If the charity hasn’t been listed on BBB yet, then enter its name and other information.
 Depending on where you live, the BBB website might direct you to a local branch of the BBB. At the local website, you can fill out a complaint. You will have to provide similar information as you would provide for a national complaint:your name and contact information

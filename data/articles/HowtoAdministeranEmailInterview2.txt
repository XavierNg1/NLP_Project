 This will provide you with the insight you need to develop strong interview questions. For example, when interviewing a professional athlete, research their sports background to learn the names of other teams they have played for, and about their career highlights.


Use the Internet as a resource when researching a person's background and accomplishments, or consult with your subject's publicist, if applicable.
 Your questions should contain only one inquiry or concept per question to keep the task clear and to the point. For example, for your first question, ask the subject if they enjoy drinking wine, then for the second question, inquire about the subject's favorite type of wine.


Write 1 or 2 general questions to begin the interview, then segue into more specific questions or topics as the interview progresses. For example, begin by asking a pastry chef why they chose baking as a career, then ask them additional questions specifically about the new bakery they are opening in your city.
 Your subject should then answer your interview questions and send them back to you via email prior to the deadline you gave them.
 In most cases, especially if you are submitting the interview questions and answers to your boss or publishing the content to a website, you may need to make certain grammar and punctuation edits. Sometimes, you may need to re-word their answers in a manner that matches the style of your readership or publication.


Review any major editing changes with your subject prior to publishing the interview. For example, if you feel the need to edit a specific quote provided to you by the subject, contact the subject before publication to clarify that you have their permission to edit their quote.
 Your thank you can be in the form of an email or telephone call, along with a final copy of the interview questions and answers.

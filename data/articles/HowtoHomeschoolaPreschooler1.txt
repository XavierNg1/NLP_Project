 Developing a routine for your child is fundamental. Routines instill security, structure, and self-discipline in your child. Create a schedule for your child. The schedule should outline times for waking up, eating, learning, napping, playing, and sleeping. You can also include things you need to accomplish like chores, prepping for meals, and cleaning.You should dedicate at least 30 minutes to each of these activities. For example, 30 minutes for making breakfast, 30 minutes for eating, and 30 minutes for learning. Of course, adjust the schedule to your and your child's needs. It may take longer to prep a meal, for example.
Be sure to schedule times for daily reading. These times can be in the morning when your child first wakes up, or at night before bedtime.;
, Children have short attention spans. Develop short 30-minute sessions that are broken down into 10-minute intervals. For example, if you have a speech and language lesson planned, set aside 10 minutes for practicing the ABC’s, 10 minutes for reading a book, and 10 minutes for naming animals. You can plan two 30-minute sessions per day, i.e., a session for the morning and a session for the afternoon.Depending on your child’s age, these lessons can be shorter or longer. For example, if your child is younger, like 2 or 3, try out 20-minute lesson plans. If your child starts to become frustrated or bored, perhaps ending the lesson early is a good idea.
 When developing your child’s lesson plans and activities, remember that there are resources out there to help you. For example, you can join a homeschool co-op in your local community or online. These co-ops are great for getting feedback and advice from other parents who homeschool their children, especially if you are a first-timer.There are also local homeschool expos you can attend. These expos are usually regional, so plan ahead so you and your child can attend. Expos offer exhibitions, speakers, and workshops for you or your child to attend.

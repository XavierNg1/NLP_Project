 Most interior locking doors made in the last few decades use a special type of doorknob that allows the door to be opened in the event of it being locked by accident. If your interior door handle has a small, round hole in the center, it is this type of handle.
 Hexagonal or “hex” wrenches, also called “Allen wrenches,” are usually available for less than the cost of a fancy coffee at most hardware and home stores. They are small, L-shaped pieces of metal that come in an array of widths both metric and imperial.
 You may have to try one or two different sizes to find the correct one, but it's usually fairly obvious. You want a fairly snug fit, but you shouldn't have to scrape or jam the wrench in. If you push the wrench in straight while turning it back and forth slightly, you should feel it catch on something.
 Once the wrench is fitted into the handle, a simple turn will unlock it. It shouldn't take a lot of force.

 If your paragraph is going to be about Billy wanting chocolate, you shouldn't be talking about flying pigs.;
, Maybe Billy trips over his couch before reaching the chocolate bar! Instead of writing "Billy trips over a couch and falls before reaching the chocolate bar," make the sentence more detailed. For example, "Billy trips over a blue, leather couch before reaching his crunchy chocolate bar." Not only does adding details make your paragraph longer, it will also give the reader(s) a better understanding of your idea.
 Paragraph length depends on the writer. Try not to go over twelve sentences, but exceed at least five. For example, would you prefer "Billy trips over a blue, leather couch before reaching his crunchy chocolate bar, and then gets up finally holding on to the delicious chocolate and then eating it," or, "Billy trips over a blue, leather couch before reaching his crunchy chocolate bar, and then gets up finally holding on to the delicious chocolate and then eating it. Billy can hear the crunch of the almonds in his head. After eating the whole thing, he wished he had bought some more." As you can see, only one - three more sentences can make the paragraph much more detailed and enjoyable.
 Even if you do have a long, detailed paragraph, make sure to use capitalized letters for proper nouns and also at the beginning of a sentence. "billy was planning on going back to the store with his friend molly to get more chocolate bars." Do you see how annoying that was? "Billy was planning on going back to the store with his friend Molly to get more chocolate bars." This is definitely more attractive. Also, remember to use apostrophes. For example, "Billy already had twelve chocolate bars, so he DOESN'T want any more." The sentence should really say, "Billy already had twelve chocolate bars, so he DOESN'T want any more." Also, if it's a first person narrative, you should say ____ and I to being the sentence, or when being used as any subject of a sentence. "Me and Molly...." This beginning of that sentence is incorrect. "Molly and I...." is the correct way.
 If you decided to write a realistic historical fiction about George Washington's life, make sure all of the facts are pure. Writing something with fake facts may get you a bad grade. An unrealistic sentence would be - "George Washington's best friend is Selena Gomez." Doing just the simplest research, one can see that John Beamer was George Washington's best friends and also one of his best campaign supporters."

, For example, "vivid". In a sentence, you want to use unique words, but don't overuse them. "Billy's house was full of vivid colors: a bright blue couch, a glowing yellow lamp, and also a red carpet that contrasted with the wooden floor." â€”That sentence had a variety of different words, but, "Billy's vivid house was full of vivid colors: A vivid blue couch, a bright yellow lamp, and a vivid red rug that contrasted against the wooden floor." becomes repetitive and redundant. Try using a thesaurus.
 For openings, try indicating when, where, and with who the paragraph involves. For example, "It was a cold Saturday night in New York which explains why Billy had his friends over." See how that told a lot of information in one sentence? The ending is a little more basic, and depending on the story type there are many different ways to end it. Biographies can end with possibly the person's funeral or death. A fantasy can typically end in anyway you want, so be creative!

, The title explains most of it. Make sure you put "Potentially meaningless dialogue here." - It's like any other sentence: it needs a capital letter, and must end with something like a period at the end. Make sure you put quotation marks around it. Also, whenever someone speaks, you should normally put a lead-in or lead-out such as "he exclaimed" or "she shouted."

, These are usually optional and describe the order of events. For example, ** FIRST, they went to the park. **THEN they got a snack. **AFTERWARDS they went to the movies. **LASTLY, they went over Brianna's house for a sleepover. Transition words usually include, FIRST, LAST, NEXT, THEN, A(N) HOUR; MINUTE; SECONDS LATER, or even, ON THE WAY FROM/TO ______.

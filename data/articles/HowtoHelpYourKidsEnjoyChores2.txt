 The first step to developing an enjoyable chore routine is to associate chores with positivity. If your child misbehaves, consider withholding a privilege, such as a video game or TV show, instead of adding a task to their list of chores.An exception might be if you have multiple children and one of your kids does something to another. For example, if one child steals from another, have them complete a task normally assigned to the one whose item they stole.
 Creating a chore routine involves structure and consistency. Do your best not to let your child turn on the television or their video game system without first finishing a household task.For instance, when they get home from school, make sure their coat is hung up, shoes are away, and bed is made before they can watch TV.
 Completing tasks with younger children will show them how to do their chores properly and in a timely manner. Doing chores with older children will help you keep in touch with them if they have a busy schedule.For example, have your kindergartner sort laundry with you, preteen wash dishes while you dry them, or teenager tend to the garden with you.
If a younger child understands how to complete a task, theyâ€™ll be less like to dread their chores. Using chores as a bonding experience with an older child can help enrich your relationship with them.
 Setting aside a specific time for everyone to clean up will help everyone feel part of a larger whole. Incorporate something fun into the routine to motivate everyone to finish their tasks.For example, after dinner, have everyone do a tidying task: have one person pick up odds and ends around the house, have another handle the dishes or dishwasher, and have someone else wipe down the table and counters.
Put on music everyone enjoys and make a party out of cleaning time.
After cleaning time, do something fun together, like make sundaes, watch a movie, or play a board game.

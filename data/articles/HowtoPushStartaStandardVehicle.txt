 The driver should also make sure to have his foot pressed all the way down on the clutch. The drivers foot should remain in this position until step 6.;
, (Regularly turning the key here would initiate the starter)


Once the starter has failed to start the vehicle, the driver should shift into a gear.
The car will now need to move by the use of physical force. One can either use gravity (hills) to their advantage or have the car pushed by someone else. Ask a passenger if they are willing to help push.
 Make sure the clutch pedal is pressed down and that it is in the correct gear (2nd gear is recommended). Make sure that it is safe to move the vehicle and take into account any affects gravity will have on the vehicle. Release the hand brake and have the car pushed or let it roll down a hill.
 This is done by releasing the clutch pedal in it's entirety for a second or less and then pressing it back all the way down at a quick speed. If your foot is left off the clutch pedal for over a 2 seconds the car will stop moving and the battery will remain dead.
 This will send mechanical power to the alternator, which will send electricity back to the battery. In other words, simply driving your car will recharge it's battery.
 If it is not left on long enough the battery will still be considered dead once the car is shut off.
 Now that your vehicle is moving, its next destination should be the garage. Make sure to have your cars dead battery checked by a professional.

 To start your conversation, all you need to do is say something like "Hi, how are you?" This gives you an opening statement and a question for your partner to respond to. It gets you past the awkwardness that can develop when each person is waiting for the other to talk and lets you jump right in to the conversation.


Be ready â€” once you start, there's a good chance your partner will ask you a few pleasantries about how you are doing.
 Having one or two questions ready beforehand helps here. This way, you won't need to waste time during your conversation to think about them. Try to pick topics that your partner will be interested in and able to comment on. If it's obvious that they have a certain interest, ask about this. If not, you can simply comment on whatever you're both doing at the moment and ask for input.
 As the conversation progresses, continue commenting on the things that are being talked about during pauses and ask for your partner's input. As you continue the conversation, you learn more about the person you're talking with. This will make it easier over time to have conversations that feel natural and can give you some opening topics next time you talk.
 If you sense awkward silence coming, change the topic or end the conversation. By avoiding the silence in the first place, you are avoiding the common problem of rambling to try to bring the silence to an end. If you do find yourself in this situation, calm down and simply ask them about something "easy" like their family, a movie that's out right now, or the area where they live. These sorts of topics can "rescue" you from awkwardness.


If things do get awkward, remember that you can always simply leave!

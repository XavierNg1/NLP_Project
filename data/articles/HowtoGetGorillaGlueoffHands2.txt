 Wipe with a dry cloth or paper towel as soon as the glue spill occurs. If you catch it within a couple minutes, you may be able to remove all the glue.
 Gorilla glue hardens when in contact with water, so this won't be 100% successful unless you catch the glue immediately. Wash with soap and plenty of water.









Bar soap will provide additional friction, but liquid soap may be more powerful. If using liquid soap, consider dish-washing soap instead of hand soap, unless you have sensitive skin.

 The Sleep/Wake button can be found along the top of the iPad, and is used to turn the screen on and off. The Home button is in the center at the bottom.
 The screen will shut off before the Apple logo appears. Continue to hold both buttons until you see the logo., Once you see the Apple logo, you can release the buttons and wait while your iPad finishes booting up. This may take a minute or two.

 If you're using a single letter, a large wooden letter is a good pick. If making a name or word, a large capital letter with smaller letters is one possibility. Or, keep all the letters the same size.;
, To make the letters look better and to remove the rough side edges, measure a piece of ribbon or braid around the letter edge. Glue in place. Allow to dry before proceeding.


Repeat with any other letters being used.
 Glue the sequins in one of the following ways:


Make a border of large sequins around the edge. Fill in to the middle with small sequins.
Make a letter within a letter; design a smaller letter inside the wooden letter. Glue one color of sequins around this letter outline, then infill the rest of the wooden letter with a different color of sequins.
Glue sequins randomly. Any color, any size, anywhere.
Glue with beads, pearls, buttons or artificial gems.
 If you are using a theme, make sure to keep the theme moving through all of the letters used.
 Use the ribbon or braid to glue a loop hanger at the top back of the wooden letter or letters. Allow to set before hanging.
 There are lots of ways to use the decorated letter:


Place on a closet to denote the owner.
Hang letters in a row as a sign on a door or window, spelling out a word, or even a phrase.
Hang a letter up for a party decoration.
Hang a letter or word up in your desk space.

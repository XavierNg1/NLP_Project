 You need to watch what you eat and start an exercise program. Not only will it improve how you look, it will also ensure that you don't blow up (run out of breath and start wheezing in the middle of the ring), and that in itself will go far.;
, Going to wrestling school will help you learn everything that you possibly need to know to have the skills to get into the ring. Just remember that wrestling shape and weightlifting shape are two totally different things. Just lifting weights isn't going to make you a professional wrestler, so you'll need to go to wrestling school in addition to lifting weights. The greatest cardio you will get as a wrestler is being in the ring.
 The more books you read, the more you'll succeed in the ring. Don't just read it, apply it.
 Eat a diet rich in protein, fruits, and vegetables so you'll look good in your wrestling gear and you'll be a better wrestler too. Avoid foods high in sugar and fat.
 You're not going to get paid much at first but once your skills start improving, you'll start making more money and bringing in the big bucks. The key is to never stop trying to improve.

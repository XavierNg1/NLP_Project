 Squeeze out the juice of half a lemon, then add just a few drops of water. Mix the liquids together and transfer into a small bottle or container to pack in your kit.Pack some cotton swabs so you can write with the ink. You can also use a small paintbrush or a toothpick.
To read your message, hold the paper on which you've written close to a lightbulb. The heat from the bulb will reveal the message.
 The walkie talkie will allow you to call for help or report anything suspicious. You can check in for any updates on your mission and let your partner or home base know where you are.
 You may need to leave a coded message or have to crack someone else's secret code. Cut out two concentric circles (one larger than the other) and place the smaller circle in the center of the larger circle. Use a tack or a brass fastener to hold the small circle in place, but allowing it to turn. If you use a tack, stick a small eraser on the sharp part.Make 26 sections on each circle and write the letters of the alphabet in the sections. Make sure they are written in order.
Match up the letters in the inner and outer circle. To write in code, choose a number (like four), and then turn the inner circle that many spaces (so the "A" on the outer circle matches up with the "E" on the inner circle").
Encrypt the text of your message by locating each letter of on the outer circle, but writing down the corresponding letter on the inner circle. So, to encrypt "HELLO" with Cipher 4, you write "LIPPS."
Make sure you tell the person picking up the code the cipher number!

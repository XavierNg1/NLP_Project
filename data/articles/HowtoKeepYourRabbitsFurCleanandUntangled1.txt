 Spot-cleaning your rabbit is the recommended method for keeping its coat clean. The first thing you’ll need to do is identify any areas of its coat that are dirty. In general, a rabbit’s problem areas are their backside, tail, feet, and belly because these are all places they may be unable to reach easily on their own. Look for dirt, food, and feces stains, as well as wet spots, which are often urine., Once you have identified any soiled spots on your rabbit’s coat, place your rabbit in a position that is both comfortable for them and that makes it easy for you to reach the soiled areas.


Most of the time, you will need to position your rabbit on its back. To do so, either hold your rabbit belly-up in one arm or sit on the floor with your legs outstretched and lay your bunny belly-up on top of your legs. Make sure you are able to hold your rabbit securely in whichever position you choose.
If the soiled area is on your bunny’s back or sides, you can simply lay a towel out on the floor or a large table and sit your rabbit on its feet to clean its fur.Ensure your rabbit’s back is cushioned and its neck and back are supported in whichever position you put it. This will help prevent any injuries., Now that you have your rabbit in a position that lets you easily access the stains on its fur, gently rub the fur and skin with a baby wipe to remove any dirt, food, feces, or urine. After you have targeted all the soiled areas, give your rabbit an all-over wipe-down with a clean wipe.


Look for baby wipes that are fragrance-free, alcohol-free, and hypo-allergenic. In addition, choose one that contains aloe and Vitamin E. These will be gentle on your rabbit’s sensitive skin.

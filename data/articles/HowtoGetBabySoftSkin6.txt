Make an exfoliation serum: 2 tbsp honey, 2 tbsp brown sugar, and half a lemon into a small bowl/container. Mix.
Rub into the skin for five minutes.
For additional softness, wait an extra 10-15 minutes before rinsing with warm water, and patting dry.
 Run yourself a warm bath, add about half a liter of milk, about 3 tablespoon (44Â ml) of honey (this is not enough to make you sticky), and break open a vitamin E capsule into the water.

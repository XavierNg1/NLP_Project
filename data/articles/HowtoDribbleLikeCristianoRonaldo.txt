 To dribble like Cristiano Ronaldo, you need to be very fast. To improve on your speed, do some sprinting every day. More importantly, do stretches before a game or a run. You need stamina, so go for a jog around a field.;
,, Before you get into flicks feints and step overs, train until you can dribble very fast between cones, keeping the ball under tight control and close to you all the time. Perfect the basics before you try to play like Ronaldo.
 This is done by swinging your foot around the ball and doing a body feint in the same time to send the defenders the wrong way.
 This is done by jumping with one foot and in the same time using the inside of your other foot to go the other way. I prefer jumping with my left foot and using the inside of my right foot to go the other way.
 Use your speed and tricks to beat the full-back and whip the ball into the box!

, When you dribble, don't hit the ball 5 meters away from you because you will get tackled and teammates might even think it's a pass. Keep the ball close to you, like if it was glued to your feet! Dribbling around the house will help the moves become second nature.
 If you're too close, the defender can easily swipe the ball away from you. Try to get the ball between the legs of the defender.
 If you're too far away, the defender will not get off-balanced and can still approach you.
 Do them approximately 3 feet away from a defender.

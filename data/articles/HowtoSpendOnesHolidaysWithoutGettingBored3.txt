 If you can't think of things to do, one of your friends probably can. When all else fails, simply try going for picnics or hanging out at a shopping mall with your friends. A sleepover is another great idea.
 If you have nothing you need to do for yourself, you may want to volunteer to help someone else. Ask friends and relatives if they have any projects they need help on, and, if so, offer your services!

, The holidays are a great opportunity to have rare, cherished conversations with family members you haven't seen for a long time. For instance, you might want to visit your grandparents and have a quality talk with them. You might be surprised how funny and insightful some of your very own relatives have become without your noticing.
 Time with a cherished animal friend is underrated, especially if it's with one you haven't seen for a while. Your pet (or pets) probably miss you if you've been gone, so spend a little time walking them, playing with them, etc. A pet's unconditional love can be a great mood-booster if you've become oppressively bored over the holidays.
 If there's no one around that you'd like to spend time with, don't forget that you always have the option of making new friends. You might choose to do this at a social hang-out spot like a club, or, alternatively, at an event like a concert. Don't be afraid to approach and talk to people you meet - new friendships have to start somewhere!


You'll never make new friends from inside your home, so get out there! Getting out of the house is the most crucial, pivotal step in turning a boring holiday into a fun, productive one.
 Having a party is a great way to have fun. You can invite your friends and have a fiesta themed on the weather. If it's sunny, have it beach themed. If it's cold, you and your friends can stay inside and have a nice cup of cocoa.

 On a piece of graph paper, draw a vertical line to represent the position of Jupiter. Make a large dot representing Jupiter on the vertical line you drew, then skip several lines down and make another large dot. Proceed to make Jupiter dots for as many days as you’ll be making observations, and label each area with a date or day of the week.


Once you’ve drawn your Jupiter dots, go to the first one and plot the moons relative to the vertical line. For example, graph the moon that’s closest to Jupiter one line to the left or right of the Jupiter dot, depending on what you observe. Graph the next closest moon two lines away from the dot.
You can number the moons by brightness, or if you’d like, you can cross check them with your Jupiter mobile app and color code them using colored pencils.
 While seven to nine days will give you usable data, making observations for a month more will increase the accuracy of your measurements. Each dot you drew will help you make your graph for that day, so on the second day of your observations, plot the moons relative to the second Jupiter dot.


Be sure to continue to use your labeling or color coding system to keep track of each moon.
If you cannot observe on a certain day, skip the graph for that day.
 Draw a line to connect each moon’s daily positions. When you do this correctly, you trace out a wave pattern, called a sine wave. Now you have a graph of the moon's positions over time. You can even use this pattern to predict the moons' positions over several years!

 Although some mental health conditions require medication for adequate management of symptoms or chemical imbalances, many mental health problems are amenable to non-medical treatments. Even more conditions improve the most with a combination of medical and non-medical mental health therapies.;
, Some health insurance plans offer reimbursement only for specific types of mental health therapies, such as talk therapy sessions, institutionalization, substance abuse rehabilitation treatment, and group therapy.


Your mental health professional may be able to examine your health insurance coverage to find other potentially helpful mental health therapies that are also covered under your insurance, such as massage or acupuncture, or phone-based therapies.
 Some research indicates significant improvements in symptoms for certain mental health conditions with therapies such as art or music therapy, exercise-based therapy, hydrotherapy (water-based therapy or massage), acupuncture or aromatherapy, and herbal remedies.


Work with your mental health professional to build and tailor a mental health therapy plan specific to your wants and needs.

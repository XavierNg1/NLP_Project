 A name containing the date (ex. “Summary for the Week of December 1”) is an easy, efficient option. Be sure to date the report.


If this report will be an email, you can use this as the subject line.
If the report will be a standalone document, place a header with this information on top.
 These include the project/assignment title, the starting and/or ending date, and the names of the people who have worked on it.
 Use a heading such as "Accomplishments," "Completed Tasks," "Completed Action Items," or even simply "Done."


Be sure to specify the reporting period (i.e. week, month, quarter, etc.).
Use active verbs to start the sentences. These include words like completed, defined, solved, designed, organized, improved, fixed, and filed, to name a few examples.
For a brief weekly report, 3 to 6 one-sentence bullet points may be enough.
 A good heading for this new section is "Planned tasks", "Next Steps", or "To Do."


Estimate the amount of time a task will require, if you can do so confidently. Ex. "Document the bracket design change. (Estimated time: 2 days)."
Refer to any schedules you have been given.
Again, 3 to 6 lines should be enough for a brief report.
 This is where you should clarify any need for guidance or help. "Open Issues" or "Issues and Comments" are good headers for this section, which can be a short paragraph or two.


Perhaps you're having trouble reaching a supplier because nobody is in the office this week. Perhaps you have a suggestion on how to improve the way the business is run. These are the kinds of details you’ll want to include in this section.
If you are simply reporting the problem and don't require assistance at this point, say so. Comments such as "We expect to solve this issue within the next 2 days" let supervisors know that they do not need to get involved but should monitor the situation.
If a situation does not get resolved, your supervisor cannot complain that you did not inform him/her earlier.

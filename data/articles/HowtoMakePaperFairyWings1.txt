 Using any kind of paper, draw the shape of your wings. Use two pieces of paper with each wing on a different sheet. Make sure each wing is exactly the same shape and size.


If you want double layered wings, draw the same wing shape out twice, but with one bigger than the other.
For 3D wings, cut multiple layers of wings is descending sizes.
You can also make the wings out of cardboard for sturdier wings.;
, Use a pair of scissors to cut the wings out. Try to cut the edges as smooth as possible. Follow the lines so your wings stay the same size and shape.


If you drew on white paper, color the wings. You can color them before or after you cut them out. Cutting them after you color may make it easier since you can color over the lines and then cut off the excess.
Be creative with the way you draw or decorate them. Draw veins along the wings, glue flowers, or tape sequins to them.
Try covering the paper with glitter, gold or silver paint, or gold trim.If you drew them on cardboard, try painting the cardboard. Just make sure to let the paint dry before building the wings.
 Tape the wings together in the center. On the back of each wing, place straws. The straw acts as the support for your paper wings so they keep their shape and don't tear. Try to have at least 3 straws on each wing. There should be one at the top, one at the bottom, and one at the bottom. Use bendy straws so that you can shape them to your wing.


If your wings have points, each straw should run from the center of the wings towards the points. If your wings are rounded, place straws on the top, bottom, and middle.
If you want 3D wings, tape the layers of wings together. You can leave just the wingtips untaped, or more of the wing to give it a fluttering look. Place the straws on the back of the bottom wing.

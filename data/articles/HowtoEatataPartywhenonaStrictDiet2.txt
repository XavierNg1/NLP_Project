 Water can help make you feel full. If you drink water throughout the night, and before a party, you're less likely to overeat. Have a glass of water on hand at all times. You should also drink a glass of water before leaving for a party.See if the party has things like flavored seltzer water. You can also try adding fruit to a glass of water.
 If you are at a party with buffet-style dining or snack tables, make sure you stand away from the food. If possible, you may even want to stay in another room. People tend to congregate and linger around the food tables at events, so make an effort to step away and keep your back to the table. This way you won't be staring at the food all night, thinking about what you can't eat and maybe talking yourself into having something you shouldn't eat.If it's a sit down dinner, try to excuse yourself before dessert is served to avoid temptation, and instead move around to chat with people at other tables. Or, if this is not an option, simply say you do not wish to be served dessert., Pick the smallest plate offered when filling up at the buffet. If you have less room, you will not be able to fit as much food on your plate. You will not have room for indulgent items that will sabotage your diet.Downsizing your plate has a psychological effect. If you eat off of a smaller plate, you feel like you're eating a lot. This helps you feel full and satisfied quicker.
 Be aware of not only what you're eating, but how you're eating. Tiny sips and bites will force you to eat and drink slower. You will follow your body's cues better and notice when you feel full. Then you can stop eating when you've had enough food, rather than mindlessly snacking.Be sure to chew your food slowly as well and sip water in between bites.
Some people find setting utensils down between bites helps slow their eating.

 Most stores break down and recycle their cardboard boxes, and if you ask to speak to a manager you will probably have a good chance of walking off with as many free boxes as you can carry.


Look specifically for produce boxes. For example, apple crates are sturdy and can help you move heavy or fragile items.;
, Bookstores, liquor stores, restaurants, office supply stores, hardware stores and electronic stores will be happy to give away their boxes after they have unloaded merchandise.


Find out on which days shipments are received. You will have better luck at the end of those days, when trucks have been unloaded and everything unpacked.
 Professional buildings and companies receive shipments too. Boxes that hold reams of paper are especially useful because they have lids.
 The cafeterias might have food boxes and the administrative offices might have supply boxes they would be happy to get rid of.
 People often leave their boxes anywhere that recycling is collected.
 Everyone notices when someone new moves into the neighborhood. They might be able to collect recently used moving boxes for you.

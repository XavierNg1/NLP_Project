 You should also make sure that the device which the capacitor powers is unplugged before your continue. If the appliance is instead hard wired, simply turn the circuit breaker off.;
, In some cases you will see terminal labels that have been printed on the housing or lid of the capacitor. Capacitors which don’t have such labels don’t need them because they are non-polarized.
 You can use needle-nose pliers to make this easier. Use the pliers to terminal connector off the terminal. Make sure you don’t use the pliers to pull on the wire.
 Make sure the metal of the screwdriver is touching the two terminals – this will discharge your capacitor. In case you want to test a dual capacitor, make sure to hold the screwdriver on the “COM” labelled terminal. Then use the screwdriver to independently touch the other terminals.
 Take its two leads and touch them together in order to zero the meter.
 In case your capacitor is polarized, then you have to put the black lead on its negative terminal. In case it is a dual capacitor that you are testing, put the black lead on its “COM” terminal.
 Take a look at the reading of the ohmmeter. If the needle goes to infinite, then retreats a little bit and moves back to infinite again, then the capacitor has passed the test. The capacitor will not pass the test if the needle goes to infinite and then stays there or if the needle doesn’t move at all.

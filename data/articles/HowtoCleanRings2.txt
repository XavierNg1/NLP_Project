 Make sure that the toothpaste contains baking soda and fluoride. The higher the concentration of Tin (II) fluoride, the better it is for metals. Tin (II) fluoride is used to strengthen both metals and tooth enamel. The cheaper the brand of the toothpaste, the better it will work.
 Use a clean toothbrush, and do not use the toothbrush on your teeth afterward. Gently rub the toothpaste into the jewelry as though you were brushing your teeth. If it gets gummy, add more water.


Make sure to clean between any cracks or ridges in your ring. Use the toothbrush like you would use it on your teeth, brushing gently, firmly, and thoroughly.
You should clean your ring every few weeks to months, depending on how often you wear it. Consider dedicating a toothbrush to ring-cleaning, and do not use it for anything else.
 After a little while, rinse the jewelry and watch it shine! You can use oils or anti-oxidizing agents (citric acids, no-ox, tarn-x, etc.) to promote and prolong the shine. If you need heavy-duty cleaning, use denture bonding agents like Fix-O-Dent, which will practically sandblast your jewelry if you brush them lightly into the material.

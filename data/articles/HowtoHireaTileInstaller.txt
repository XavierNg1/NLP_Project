 Larger tile or a project involving laying various sizes of tile in a pattern will be more expensive to install.;
, Call anyone you know who has had tile installed recently and get the name of the contractor if it was a good experience. Ask if you can stop by to look at the workmanship of the installed tile.
 Beware that this list isn't necessarily a referral, but rather a list of tile installers that routinely buy tile from them. However, you can expect these tile installers to have a lot of experience.
 You might ask some preliminary questions to find out if they are suitable for your project, such as the number years in business, the number tile jobs completed a month, and availability to start your project. Ask if the installer has a current project underway that you can stop by to see the quality of the work.
 You should do this even if you have a referral, just to compare pricing. Ask the following questions during this meeting:


How much tile should you order?
How soon can the work be done?
How many days will the project take?
How many workers will be on the project?
Can you get a copy of their insurance certificate?

, The bid should outline the following in as much detail as possible:


The services being provided, which may include removing existing tile, installing underlying material, sealing the grout and disposing of the old tile.
The materials being supplied by the tile installer, such as underlying materials, grout and sealant.
The amount you need to pay upfront. You should never be expected to pay the full amount until the installation is done.
 Ask each reference when the project was started and completed, whether the tile contractor showed up on time, adequately prepped the area, did a high quality installation, and cleaned up at the end of the project.
 Hire a tile installer that has a fair price, has good feedback from references and presents himself in a professional manner.

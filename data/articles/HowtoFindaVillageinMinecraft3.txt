 One of the easiest ways to find villages in your existing game is to switch over to creative mode so that you can fly around until you find one. The process for switching modes varies depending on your version:


PC - Type /gamemode 1 in the chat window to switch your world to creative mode. You'll need to have cheats enabled to do this.
Pocket - You'll need to load your level into an inventory editor app and use the tools to switch modes.
Console - It is not possible to switch between survival and creative modes on the console editions of Minecraft.
 Once you're in creative mode, you can start flying by pressing Jump twice. On your keyboard, press Space twice to start flying. On Pocket, double-tap the jump button.


Hold the jump button while flying to go up, and the crouch button to go down.
Double-tap jump again to stop flying.
 While you're flying, you can move very quickly across the world. Use your new skill to find biomes that support villages: plains, savanna, desert, and taiga (1.10+ only).


You can use this method in combination with the previous one to check multiple locations from the village finder utility much quicker than by exploring for each one on foot.
 Villages can spawn anywhere in the biome, so search the whole area before moving on to a new location.
 Once you've found a suitable village, you can switch your game back to survival mode and continue playing.


PC - Type /gamemode 0 in the chat window to switch back to survival mode.
Pocket - Use the inventory editor tool to switch your world back to survival mode.

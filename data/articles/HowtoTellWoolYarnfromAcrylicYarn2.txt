 Make sure that both pieces of yarn come from the same skein. In this method, you will be "felting" the yarn. If the yarn fuses together easily, it is made from wool. If it does not fuse together easily, it is made from acrylic.
 In order to felt the yarn, you will need to untwist it. Gently roll the yarn back and forth between your fingers until the threads loosen, and pull them apart into two, even groups. For example, if the yarn has 6 threads, separate it into 2 groups of 3 threads. Do this for both pieces of yarn.
 You will be twisting the longer threads together to fuse the yarn together.
 Lay the two pieces of yarn down on the table so that frayed ends are facing each other. Move them towards each other until the long threads overlap and the short threads touch.
 You can do this simply by dipping them in water, or misting them lightly with a spray bottle. You can also lick them.
 As you roll, the long threads may come together. Don't worry if they don't come together easily or at all. This is part of the test!

, If the two pieces have fused together easily, and are difficult to pull apart, the yarn is made from wool. If the two pieces did not fuse together easily, and they come apart, the yarn is acrylic.Felted wool may look dull and feel a little stiff, especially if it was soft and silky to begin with.

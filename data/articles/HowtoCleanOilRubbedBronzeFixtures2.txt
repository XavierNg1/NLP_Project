 Prevent hard water stains from forming by blotting your fixture dry whenever you see drops of water. Allowing water to evaporate on the surface is what leaves mineral deposits behind.Use just a dry cloth or towel to absorb any moisture, without rubbing or buffing.
Do this daily for faucets and other fixtures that are very frequently exposed to water.
 Apply a very thin layer of wax intended for metals to your fixture. Do this to help maintain the shine and protect against water stains.


Look for a high quality wax like Renaissance Wax, or another brand trusted for use on antique furniture.
Apply the wax using a soft cloth, ensuring to the best of your ability that no excess builds up in cracks or other areas of the fixture, leaving a residue.
Do this maintenance rarely, only when it appears your finish is wearing unusually thin from damage or overly abrasive cleaning.
 Use a very small amount of vegetable oil on your fixture every so often. Donâ€™t use so much that it leaves a residue that will come off on your hands.Note that the oils from human hands on frequently-touched areas will naturally add shine and create a lighter coloring on the bronze over time.Do this maintenance only when it appears your finish is losing shine, either from excessive wear or overly abrasive cleaning.

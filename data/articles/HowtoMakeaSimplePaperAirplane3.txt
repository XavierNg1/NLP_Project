 Using an A4, 8.5x11 inch letter size piece of paper, turn the paper vertically. Make a 1-inch fold horizontally along the top of the paper. Repeat this 8 times, folding each time on top of the previous fold, for eight folds. The paper will now be about half the size it was before.









Make sure the folds are lined up exactly on top of one another and tightly folded.
The creases should be sharp and crisp. To achieve a sharp crease, use your thumb or a blunt-edged tool, like a wooden depressor or a butterknife.
 Before you fold, flip the paper over. The folds should not be visible after you flip it over. Now, fold the paper in half along the vertical, matching the edges of the paper exactly. The folds will now be visible.
 Leaving around 1/2 inch to an inch at the bottom, fold over the top of the paper. Repeat this on the other side, making sure the crease is even along the top of the plane.









The folds should be on the bottom of the plane.
The kite plane is capable of great distance and accuracy.

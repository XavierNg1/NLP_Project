 Most social networks, such as Facebook, twitter, Instagram, etc allow you to control who sees your information, photos and posts.


Think about who will be seeing the information you post. If your privacy settings are not controlled, you will be giving information about yourself out to anyone with access to the Internet.;
, Do not accept friendship or network requests from people you do not recognize.


Keep your network manageable. You probably do not need thousands of friends on Facebook and tens of thousands of followers on Twitter.
 Pictures of expensive cars, your enormous home and your pricey vacation getaways will only make you more attractive to scam artists.


Do not post personal information that can be used by others. Never mention your mother's maiden name or date of birth.
 Do not download any apps, take any quizzes or sign up for any coupons that ask for your date of birth, social security number or home address.
 Do not click on any link that is unfamiliar or comes from an unknown source. These could carry viruses or lead scammers to your personal information.
 If you follow a favorite charity's Facebook page or Twitter feed, make your donations through their website, by phone or by mail.
 Use your own computer instead of the computers at libraries and other public places. Your login information can be stolen and used to post false things.
 This will help protect you from getting hacked.
 Do not trust requests for help that come to you over social networks. If the plea for money or assistance comes from a friend, call or text that person to find out if they are really in need of help.
 Many young users are more computer savvy than you are, but they know little about identity theft and digital scams.
 Use a good virus protection plan for your computer as well.
 Do not answer texts or messages from numbers you do not recognize.

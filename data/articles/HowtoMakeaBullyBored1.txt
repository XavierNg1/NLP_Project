 The easiest technique to try if you’re being bullied is to simply Ignore a Bully. It’s no fun for them to pick on someone who ignores them. Avoid replying to any of their insults or threats, and many times you will find that they grow bored of bullying you and will stop doing it.;
, Don’t come down to the bully’s level and retaliate against them. They want to see you lose your cool and fight back physically or verbally. Refusing to retaliate will make your bully bored because they aren’t getting the angry or emotional reaction that they wanted from you., Make eye contact, square your shoulders, and firmly ask the bully to leave you alone. This is especially disengaging for bullies who have counted on you to be a meek, easy target. Showing that you’re strong and unwilling to accepting teasing and taunting might be enough to make the bully tired of bullying you.Even if you feel intimidated or scared, unless you’re in imminent physical danger, assertively standing up to your bully builds confidence, and bullies will quickly grow bored with calm, collected people who don’t respond to their harassment.
 Bullies count on you being submissive to their taunts and harassment. However, if you think about strategic things to say ahead of time to deter the bully, you might make them give up on harassing you.Some examples of good comebacks include “Is that the best you can do?” or “You’re acting like a bully. Please stop.” Laughing and saying their criticisms are ridiculous is also a great way to disengage a bully., Bullies thrive on getting a reaction from the people they harass. Bullying makes them feel powerful and important. However, if you remain calm and avoid crying, yelling, or otherwise engaging your bully, they will eventually get bored of picking on you.

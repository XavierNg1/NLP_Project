You can imagine that the movie is a totally unrelated genre to what is intended by the director and the actors.Imagine that a drama is a comedy or that a rom-com is a horror film. Try to add some flare to make things interesting, for example, Try to imagine Inception as a satirical comedy making fun of Sigmund Freud's popular work on The Interpretation of Dreams.
You can use musical accompaniment to totally re-frame the context of the movie you are watching. For example, try playing intense classical concertos as the backdrop to a child's movie or a terrible attempted comedy (possible candidates for your airwaves available here: ).
Caution: only attempt this method if you are in unhostile territory, watching a bad film by yourself or with a group who also believes the film is bad. Attempting this tactic with a loved one who actually likes the movie in question could produce disastrous consequences. Consider yourself warned.
 Perhaps there are tasteless voiceovers or facial close-ups. Corny one-liners that are either intended to be funny or diabolical but fail miserably. Once you find a consistently n00bish characteristic of the film, you and your cohort can begin to consume alcohol (or lemonade, or RC Cola, or green tea, or a mango-kiwi smoothie) each time that this same type of scenario arises in the film. Depending on the length of the film this game could become fatal and incredibly sloppy. Be careful.

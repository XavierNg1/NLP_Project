 As a rule of thumb, marinate for 7 to 10 minutes max, using olive oil and butter or your favorite store-bought fish marinade as desired. Leave the skin on your salmon fillet, and simply marinate the fish for about 10 minutes—but no more than 15 minutes. After 15 minutes the acids in the marinade break down the salmon, making the salmon very flaky.;
, It's very important to preheat your barbecue to medium-high (300 to 325 degrees F) temperature. Be sure that you're using a non-stick grill, or that you pre-coat grill with a non-stick spray made for grilling.
 Salmon meat is sturdy enough to not fall through the grill rack—but if you prefer, you can wrap the rack in heavy-duty aluminum foil for extra protection. Brush the top of the foil before putting your fish on it.
 Do not overcook salmon. Salmon is best served medium-rare. Your salmon is cooked correctly when it feels firm, but with a little give when you press down on it.

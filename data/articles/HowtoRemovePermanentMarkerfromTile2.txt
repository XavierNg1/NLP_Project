 Do not use gel toothpaste. If possible, choose a toothpaste product that contains baking soda such as Arm & Hammer. Toothpaste is great for removing marks from tile that is textured., Cover the affected area with the toothpaste. Let the toothpaste set for a minute or two. The longer the stain has been on the tile, the longer you will want to let the toothpaste set.For example, if the marker has been on the tile for a 24-hour period, then let the toothpaste set for at least five minutes.
 After the toothpaste has set, begin wiping it off with a sponge. If your tile is textured, then you may want to use a toothbrush or a scrubbing brush to remove traces of the stain from smaller crevices in the tile.Once the stain is removed, clean the affected area with soap and water to remove any residue.

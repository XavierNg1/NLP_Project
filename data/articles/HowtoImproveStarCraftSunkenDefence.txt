 There are many types of mazes and things you can put in each.


A trap, the bulk of your enemy forces will fall here and stay here for a while until finding the hole in your maze and trying to run through.
A maze that will keep your enemy running around so they can be attacked more.;
, Divide your enemy up and attack the one that is farthest in your maze using a concentrated mass of units.
, Block these gaps using cheap units and then test to see that nothing gets through using a ghost/ling.
 If your enemies encounter a wall and have nowhere to go because the opening is too small then they will move backwards. When they get to the last square of where they spawn then a trigger activates and you lose the game. Walling is stupid and will cause a loss.
 This wall works because instead of blocking the enemy and making them stuck and stop moving (where they may start attacking your defence) or turning around, they get deflected off to the sides but will always be trying to go through your defence and thus you should never lose (except to air mobs). If done correctly this is the ultimate defence but in the end you will just be building the same defence over and over again taking away some fun of the map.

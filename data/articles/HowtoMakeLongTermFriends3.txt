 If two of your close friends are fighting, remain neutral. Avoid taking any sides because you may lose their trust. If possible, calm them down and have them both tell their sides of the story. Do your best to work out a good solution that benefits both friends.


If the fight is worse than you can handle, ask your friends to talk to a trusted adult or teacher. They may be able to resolve the situation better than you can.
Avoid getting involved in their fights with other friends. While you may be willing to help, you aren't obligated to solve your friends' problems. Don't push yourself into situations that are bigger than you can handle. Keep your distance until they can resolve it among themselves.
 If they tell you any secrets, keep it to yourself. You do not have the right to tell a person's secrets to others without their permission. This will result in the loss of your friend's trust.

 Assemble all the things you'll need in this designated area. You'll need the following materials:


Toilet roll
Scissors
Wool in your squads colours
Craft glue
Paint in your squads colours
Masking tape

, If your squad has more than one colour, paint one side of the toilet roll one colour and the other side the other colour.


If you're worried about not having straight lines, use a zigzag or wave pattern. This is easier on the eye if your colours aren't exactly even.
Stand the roll on its end off to the side and let it dry.
 If your squad has two colours, cut out at least 12 strands of each colour that measure 15 cm (6 inches) in length. If your wool is thinner, cut more strands.


If you have two colours, make sure you have an even amount of each color. Pair each color up with it's opposite, having at least 12 groups of two.
 Twist and braid the wool pieces to give them volume. If you'd like to use three pieces per plait, you can, but one colour will be more dominant than the other.


Tie a knot at the end of each plait. Put a weight down or a piece of tape on the unknotted end to keep it together.
 If it is, get the craft glue and squeeze a small blob of it on the inside of the top of the toilet roll. Take one of the plaits and stick the top of it into the glue and hold for fifteen to twenty seconds. Now do the same to all of the plaits until you have them drooping over the side of the toilet roll.


If you'd like, you can make twelve more plaits and add them onto the other end of the toilet roll creating a double sided pom pom.
Let it dry by putting to the side and waiting for half and hour.

For extra security (or instead of glue) you can put small pieces of masking tape inside the toilet roll where the plaits are attached.


After half an hour, give it a bit of a shake to see if it is strong and do a mini cheer routine.

 Stress or emotional upset can trigger tachycardia.Because of this, it is important to try to lower your stress levels whenever you begin to feel anxious. One way to do this is by practicing breathing techniques. To do this:


Breathe in for four seconds through your nose. Hold your breath from a moment, and then release the breath through your mouth for another four seconds. Repeat this process five to ten times until you begin to feel calm.
 Another way to lower your stress levels is practice meditation. Meditation involves letting go of stress by releasing your thoughts. To meditate, find a quiet place to sit. Focus your thoughts on something soothing, such as the motion of waves rolling into and off of the sand.


The length of time you spend meditating is up to you based on your personal preferences. Perhaps sitting quietly will help to calm you down, while other people may need to meditate for an hour.
 Another way to fight stress is to engage both your body and mind by practicing yoga. Yoga can help to strengthen your body, while also acting as a form of meditation for your mind.


You can practice yoga at home, or you can sign up for a yoga class at your local gym or meditation center.
 Exercising often can help to improve blood circulation, which in turn can help to combat tachycardia. At the same time, exercising helps to release endorphins, which combat feelings of stress. Talk with your doctor about how often you should exercise, depending on your physical health.


Exercising regularly generally means exercising for 30 minutes, four to five times a week. Try jogging, bicycling, or swimming to get your blood flowing.

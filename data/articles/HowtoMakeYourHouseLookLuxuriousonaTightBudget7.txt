Molding creates a paneled look which draws an eye's attention to certain areas of the room.
Molding keeps the spacing even, symmetrical, and aesthetic.
Wide molding is better than narrow as it dramatically improves your homes appearance.



Molding the top your kitchen cabinets will cause a modish and eye-pleasingÂ also adding an extra level of polish to the kitchen.



This will add appeal to your bland windows.
The heavier the moulding around the windows you add the plainer the curtains should be. Remember simpler is better.

 Add ½ cup (63 g) of all-purpose white flour, 2 tablespoons (15 g) of unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 tablespoons (25 g) of sugar, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of baking powder, and ⅛ teaspoon (1 g) of salt to a small bowl. Whisk them together until they’re fully mixed., Once the dry ingredients are combined, add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of orange flavored olive oil,1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil, and ½ cup (118 ml) plus 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of milk. Blend the liquids in until a thick batter forms.You can find orange flavored olive oil at a variety of health food, gourmet grocery, and natural grocery stores. You can also infuse the olive oil with orange flavor on your own.
If you don’t have orange flavored olive oil, you can use 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of vegetable oil and 2 to 3 drops of orange essence or a pinch of orange zest.
 When the batter is fully mixed, pour it into a microwave-safe mug. Add 1 tablespoon (15 g) of mascarpone to the top, pushing it down with a spoon so it sinks into the batter., After you’ve add the mascarpone, place the mug in the microwave and heat it on high for 1 to 2 minutes. You’ll know the cake is done when the top appears dry and springy.Start by microwaving the mug cake for just a minute. If it’s not done after you heat it, continue heating it in 15 seconds intervals until it’s done.
When the cake is finished, it’s normal for some of the center to be soft and melted.
 When the cake is finished, remove it from the microwave. Add a spoonful of mascarpone cheese to the top as garnish, and serve it while it’s still warm.If you like, you can also drizzle some more of the orange flavored olive oil over the finished cake.

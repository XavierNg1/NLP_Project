 It can be a long process to take your color from black to a natural blonde. Think about what you will be getting into with this process and where you hope to be by the end.


Each session may include a stylist bleaching out the color and toning it to an acceptable shade.
It could be several sessions but the professionals will know how to reduce damage and the proper products to send you home with to continue the process.
There may still be a stage where your hair is orange but in the salon they can fix it with recoloring.
Discuss different options with a trusted stylist

, Removing black hair dye is an expensive process. It is best to shop around at a few different salons to find a group with a good price that you can trust.


Realize that you will get what you pay for so going for the cheapest quote could cost you your lovely hair just as much as home remedies could.
 Work with a professional stylist to gradually grow dye your roots to your natural or desired color. It is a slower process but will cause less damage to your hair overall and it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean your hair will turn orange.

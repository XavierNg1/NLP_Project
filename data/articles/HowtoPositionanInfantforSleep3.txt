 While driving around in the car may lull your child to sleep, it is still important to move the child to their own bed once you get home. Car seats were not designed for children to sleep in them all night long. Being in an upright position could have a negative effect on your baby’s spine.If you do decide to let your child continue to sleep in the car seat for a little longer, stay in the car with your child. If your child were to wake up while you were gone, they may wiggle and accidentally dislodge the car seat.
 Taking the car seat out and placing it on a different surface may lead to the car seat tipping over while you try to get your child out of it.


However, if you do decide to take the car seat out before lifting your child out of it, set the car seat on the floor so that it does not have far to fall if it tips over.
 Gently unbuckle the safety straps and move them out of the way. Place one hand under your child’s head and neck; place the other hand under their bottom. Once your hands are in place, lift your child out and bring them to bed.

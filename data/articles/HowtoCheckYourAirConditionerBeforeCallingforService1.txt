 Is the unit simply not working at all, is it not cooling the air much, or is it simply blowing around warm air?;

Make sure it's plugged in. This may seem obvious, but there are occasions when this is exactly the problem. Whether kids, dogs, or an accidental tap with the vacuum cleaner, the plug could be partially or completely dislodged.
Check the circuit breakers and fuses. Make sure they are in place, turned on, and functioning properly. Circuits, especially with older homes, are easily overloaded if the air conditioner shares a circuit with appliances such as irons, refrigerators, or microwaves.
Check your thermostat (cooling control) and make sure it is set to cool at the current temperature, and working properly. As with plugs, sometimes settings can change by accident.
 This can cause low air flow which allows ice to form, and thus causes low cooling performance.


Repair or replace the blower belt. Allow the ice to melt before restarting the AC unit.
 If they are caked with dust and debris, clean them thoroughly. Make sure you let any ice melt before restarting your unit.
 If you've verified that everything is connected, powered, set up properly, and clean, it may be time to call the service department.

 If you are the Mom-to-be (mtb), or the designated party-planner, make sure Dad-to-be (dtb) can and will attend. If he is not interested (and excited), it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to entice the other guys to show up.;
, Preferably, choose someone who will be excited about the party, will actively participate in planning, and who you know will really encourage male guests to show up and have a great time.
 What are his tastes? Also, what he would definitely NOT like. If he won't like it, the other men probably won't either.
, If purchasing invitations look specifically for couples or co-ed baby shower invitations which feature graphics and text that clearly indicate that couples are invited. If DIY, be sure to clearly indicate that it's a couples shower and that the dtb will be attending. Address the envelopes to both the male and female guests to make it clear who is invited.
, Don't go too crazy with lacy, loopy, flowery decorations, invitations, and gift bags; even if baby's a girl! Keep things simpler than you normally would.
 Keep Mom-to-be's restricted diet in mind, but don't expect the guys to be happy with fresh fruit and punch. Again, dtb's opinion is a big help here!

, Nothing makes some guys catch 'baby shower flu' faster than the threat he'll be caught up in potentially embarrassing games. Instead, have a diaper raffle (every guest brings a bag of diaper bags and gets a raffle ticket), and make sure the prizes are guy-friendly; or other male-appropriate activities. You may have to clarify with the men ahead of time that there won't be games, to help raise their comfort-level. Dtb can be very helpful with this.
 Instead, provide a place for hasty retreat where the guys can hang, and avoid feeling uncomfortable.

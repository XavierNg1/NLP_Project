 While basic vitamin C serum will last for up to two weeks, you should make a fresh batch of the moisturizing vitamin C serum every three days.If you want the serum to last longer, then you can store your vitamin C serum in the refrigerator for up to a week.


Even though the serum will be somewhat protected from light in a dark glass bottle, you can also wrap the bottle in tin foil to make sure that no light can get to the serum at all., Before using the serum for the first time, you may want to test it on a small patch of your skin to make sure that it is not too acidic. Place a small amount on the inside of your wrist and wait a few hours to see if you have any reaction to it.


Do not use the serum if you notice any redness or a rash after using it.
If you notice any burning or tingling, then you may want to add a little more water to the serum to reduce the acidity.
 Use your vitamin C serum twice daily after washing your face and moisturizing. If you used oil to make your serum, then the serum can take the place of your normal moisturizer.


If you notice any tingling, burning, redness, or other reaction to the serum, wash it off right away and do not use it again.

 Unlike their old-fashioned counterparts, modern-day gangsters wear baggy, casual clothes that come in various colors.


Find a pair of baggy jeans in either blue or black.
Buy an oversized t-shirt or a plain white "wife-beater" shirt.
Wear an oversized hoodie or puffy jacket.
 Gangsters are notorious for their tattoos. You can draw on fake tattoos using a pen, or apply temporary stick-on tattoos.


Many gang members get tattoos of the faces of loved ones who have passed away on their upper arms.
Draw tattoos on your face, neck, and/or chest.
 Find long silver or gold chains with dollar signs, crosses, or other symbols on them. Try wearing multiple chains of different lengths and colors.
 Either tie a bandana around your head or wrap it around your neck and tie it in the back. Beanies can be worn in any color, but should not have any designs or logos on them.

 If iTunes opens, you can close it. You will be using a different program to access the files on your iOS device.


Unless you have a jailbroken iOS device, which can be quite a hassle, you'll need to connect your iOS device to your computer first in order to copy map files onto it.;
, You can find map files from various sites online, or you can receive them from your friends. Maps for Minecraft PE are different than maps for the PC version, so make sure you are downloading the correct files. Some of the more popular map resources online include:


Planet Minecraft Projects
Minecraft Forum (Maps section)
Minecraft Maps

, If the map is a ZIP file, you can just double-click it to open it. If the file is a RAR file, you can download and use 7-Zip, one of the most popular free utilities that can open ZIP and RAR files. Click the Extract button and you will be asked for a location to extract to. Place the extracted folder somewhere you can easily find it.
 You will need a program that will allow you to access the contents of your iOS disk without going through iTunes. One of the more popular options is iFunBox, which is available for free.
 In iFunBox, click the Managing App Data tab. Browse the list for your Minecraft PE app. Open the following folders:



Documents → games → com.mojang → minecraftWorlds


, Place the downloaded and extracted map folder into the “minecraftWorlds” folder in iFunBox. You can click and drag the folder into the iFunBox window to quickly copy it. Once the folder has copied, you can disconnect your iPhone or iPad.
 Start Minecraft PE on your device. You will see your new map in your Worlds list. You can select it to begin playing it just like any other saved game.

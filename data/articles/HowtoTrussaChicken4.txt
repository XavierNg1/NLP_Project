 Center the twine at the front of the chicken so it aligns with the neck opening. If the neck bone is still there, tuck it under the neck to hold it in place.
 The twine ends should go over the wings, holding them flat against the chicken's body, and into the crevices formed where the the thighs meet the breasts. Pull the ends taught on either side.
 The twine ends should run through the cracks where the thighs meet the breast around to the ends of the breasts. Tie them together at the front of the breast, just above the back opening of the chicken.
 Cross the legs tightly against the chicken's breast. Loop the strings around the ends of the legs once more and tie a tight knot.
 Use the scissors to cut off the excess length of twine after you've made the knot to prevent the twine from burning during cooking.

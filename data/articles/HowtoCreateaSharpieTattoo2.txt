 Take your sharpie, and draw your tattoo directly onto your skin. You can use multiple colors of sharpie if you like, but keep in mind that whatever you draw will be the ‘permanent’ version. It may be easier to have a friend help with this part, to make sure that your drawing is just right. Wait for the sharpie to dry completely.
 Pour a generous amount of baby powder into your hand, and thoroughly coat the sharpie drawing with the powder. Rub it into the drawing; it shouldn’t bleed or smear. Wipe off any excess powder that doesn’t stick to your skin.
 Hold a can of hairspray 12–16 inches (30.5–40.6 cm) away from your tattoo, and spray over the entire thing. Make sure to thoroughly coat the tattoo and baby powder, although be careful not to get it all over the place. Wait for the hairspray to dry.
 Use a tissue to carefully wipe away any extra baby powder or hairspray around the tattoo. When the hairspray is dry, the tattoo should be ‘permanent’ and won’t smear when rubbed with a tissue. This method should make the tattoo last for up to a month.

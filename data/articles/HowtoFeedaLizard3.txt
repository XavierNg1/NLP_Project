 When caring for leopard geckos, you should feed them meal worms, wax worms, crickets, and roaches. These all make good food, however, most geckos' diets consist largely of crickets with other insects given occasionally.Make sure to refrigerate the mealworms, as they turn into beetles if left at room temperature.
 Place as much of the food in the tank as your gecko can eat in 15 minutes. Don't leave crickets hopping around all day, as they will feed on your gecko if left in the lizard's tank too long.The number of insects that your gecko will be able to eat in 15 minutes will vary, depending on your lizard's size, age, and appetite. Over time, as you get to know your lizard, you will learn how many insects to feed it.
 To give your lizard more nutrition, it is important to feed the crickets a lot before they are fed to your lizard. This is called "gut-loading" and is done by feeding your crickets nutritious foods, such as oats, fruit, and vegetables.When you feed crickets highly-nutritious foods, that nutrition is passed on to your lizard. On the other hand, when you feed your lizard crickets that have malnutrition, your lizard will not get enough nutrition.
 Once a week sprinkle the insects you are feeding to your lizard with calcium and vitamin D powder. This is very important to ensure bone health, as well as general health. If your gecko is not given calcium and vitamin D powder, it could get a painful metabolic bone disease.To coat the crickets, put them in a plastic bag with the supplement powder. Shake it up gently until the insects are completely covered. They should be totally white when sufficiently coated.

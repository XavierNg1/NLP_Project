 If you’re on an online dating site, you know that people you might be interested in can become unavailable really quickly. So if a guy you’re interested in asks you out, respond as quickly as possible.


You can say something like in your message back like “Thanks so much for messaging me. I’d love to go out!”

, For the same reason that you don’t want to wait too long to respond to the date request, you don’t want to wait too long to go out, either – he might get snapped up by someone else. When you message him to accept the date, make a suggestion for a date and time for it.For example, you can say something like “Thanks for asking me out – I’d love to go out! How’s Friday night at 8?”

, The whole point of a date is to get to know someone better. It can be tempting, once you’ve been asked out, to ask him a bunch of questions. Save it for the date – where it’s easier to read body language and get a sense of what kind of guy he is.Unless you've established that you both love phone conversations, refrain from calling him before the first date except to discuss meeting logistics. You can do this through the dating app or website where you met., Because accepting an online dating request means going out with someone you’ve never actually met, choose a public place to meet. This ensures there are people around during your date should anything go wrong.

 Loosen the radiator cap to release any pressure still left, and then re-tighten.

Many newer cars have the cap on the coolant reservoir instead of the radiator itself, but, on certain cars, there may be no radiator cap at all. In this case, emit the pressure by loosening the thermostat cap.;
, Elevating the car on ramps may help the process., The heater inlet hose usually runs between the firewall and the top of the radiator. This may be done using a clamp and a couple of screws., Attach a coupler to the flushing tee to prevent backwash.

The black part should attach to the tee and the yellow part should attach to a garden hose. On cars with no radiator cap (or reservoir cap), flush by disconnecting the upper radiator hose.
 A cleaning solution may have also been provided in the antifreeze flush kit.,, Some leakage of water and diluted antifreeze will come out of the tee., Replace your radiator cap and run your car for 10 minutes after it reaches its running temperature., Add more as needed.

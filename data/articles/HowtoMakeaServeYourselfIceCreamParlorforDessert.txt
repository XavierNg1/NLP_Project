 A kitchen bench-top or table are ideal places.;
, These are best placed in a row so that everyone can choose their favorites as they walk along. Good choices include:


M&Ms, Smarties, candy covered chocolate button style candies
Rainbow sprinkles/100s and 1000s
Chocolate dots/drops/pieces
Flake bars
Jelly beans or other jelly candies
Chocolate sprinkles
Cocoa powder/chocolate powder.
 Slice bananas and strawberries. Place into separate bowls for serving. If you are leaving the bananas out for a time, it's a good idea to sprinkle with lemon juice, to prevent browning.
 For example, blueberries, raspberries and loganberries.
 Pour into separate jugs or bowls, to allow for easy addition.
 Add a spoon if it helps with serving.
 Include aprons if you're worried about a mess, and definitely have napkins (serviettes).


If using cones as well as––or in place of––bowls, place these out on the table too.
 Include scoops for ease of obtaining.


If there is a break between second helpings, consider returning it to the freezer in between servings to stop it from melting.



A fun variant can be to have kids or teens as the servers who prepare what everyone else asks for, as well as their own sundaes.

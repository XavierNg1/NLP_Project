 Tap “Settings” on your iPhone or iPad home screen to launch the Settings menu.
 Tap the “Enable Restrictions” button to enable restrictions on your device.
 To protect the restrictions you’ll be setting, you have to lock them via a passcode. A “Set Passcode” screen will appear. Enter a four-digit passcode by tapping on the number pad. Re-enter it to confirm. This same passcode will be needed to make future changes to your restrictions. Make this something difficult for others to guess.
 There are some apps that have in-app purchases, meaning that you can pay for additional features or functionality right from the app. If you want to prevent others from buying these extras or add-ons, tap the toggle button for “In-App Purchases” to disable it. Nobody can make any in-app purchase anymore without your passcode. This way, you can prevent unnecessary purchases of added features, especially when you have your credit card info stored with your Apple account.

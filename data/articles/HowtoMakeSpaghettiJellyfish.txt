, For "taller" jellyfish, make bigger pieces. It's best to make marks in one as a guide before fully cutting it, align it with a row of hot dogs, and cut it down the cutting board.
 To make jellyfish, do not go all the way through the hot dog piece.
 Always follow the directions on the pasta as far as the timing goes to achieve al dente. The hot dogs only need a few minutes of boiling, however, you still need to cook the pasta inside the hot dog.

 Instead of mascara, take a bit of lip balm (flavoured works best) on your index finger and thumb and run it through your eyelashes. This will darken and lengthen your eyelashes, and over time, it will increase their actual length. You can use petroleum jelly instead of lip balm.;
, This will create a shiny, shimmery effect. You can also make the eyes themselves look bigger and brighter by wearing circle contact lenses.


Do not use fragrant or colored lotion, only plain lotion suitable for sensitive skin. Discontinue if it causes any problems. Do not get in your eyes.
 Instead of eyeshadow, you can apply baby powder to your lids. Most baby powders are white, so if you think white eye shadow will look good on you, then you can give it a shot! Subtly apply it, and it will look like eyeshadow.


The powder's effect may start through fade throughout the day.
 Lip balm works just as well as most lip glosses and will leave your lips moisturized. Make sure you don't apply too much though, as it can cause acne or irritation on the skin surrounding your lips. (If you are allowed to wear a bit of lip gloss, apply it over a thin coat of lip balm. This will cause it to stay shiny for longer)

, Instead of having to use a concealer to hide skin irritation, ask your dermatologist or a pharmacist at a local drugstore about different medications or cleansers that will help keep your skin clear. Make sure that the kind of cleanser you use is for your skin type (oily, dry, sensitive), keep a consistent skin care routine, and remember to moisturize every night

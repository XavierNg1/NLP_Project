 MS Paint 6.1 and higher no longer has this feature on the top toolbar.The Invert Colors tool is useful if you want to simply swap around the existing colors on a logo or image, rather than replace the entire color.
 If you want to invert the colors in the entire image, click on the image as a whole. But if you want to only invert the colors in part of the image, only click on the part of the image you’d like to invert.
 Scroll down to the “Invert Color” option (not “Invert Selection”).


Click on it. The section of the image you selected should now be inverted.
You can also use the shortcut Ctrl-Shift-I.

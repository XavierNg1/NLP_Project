 The best type of leaves to work with have a waxy, glossy surface, like magnolia or gardenia leaves., You will need ½ to ¾ cups (70 to 105 grams) of washing soda and 4 cups (950 milliliters) of water. Give the solution a gentle stir to combine it.Do not use baking soda; it is not the same thing.Washing soda is also called "sodium carbonate." You can find it in the laundry section of grocery stores and supermarkets., Bring the water to a boil over medium to medium-high heat first, then reduce it to a simmer. Cook the leaves until they turn soft. This will take about 90 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the type of leaf you are using.The water will evaporate as you simmer it. Add more water to the pot as needed so that the leaves don't dry out., Put on a pair of plastic or rubber gloves first. Next, use a pair of tongs or a spatula to remove the leaves from the water.If the leaves are pulpy and gloopy, soak them in a tub filled with water; this will make cleaning them easier later on.
 Hold the leaves by the stem with tweezers, and use a paintbrush or a soft toothbrush to gently brush the pulp away. Turn the leaf over, and scrape the other side clean too.It would be even better if you work while the leaves are under water.Be very gentle during this step; the leaves will be fragile., The leaves will be very delicate at this stage, so be gentle with them. Fill a tub with water, and soak the leaves in the water. You can gently swish them about, but only if you are careful. Change the water and repeat the step, if necessary.

Do not rinse the leaves under running away; the force of the stream will damage them.
 If you want the leaves to dry flat, you will need to place them between two paper towels and heavy books. The paper towels will help absorb the excess moisture while the books will help make the leaves dry flat. If you don't do this, the leaves may warp and curl, which is fine if that's the look you are going for.

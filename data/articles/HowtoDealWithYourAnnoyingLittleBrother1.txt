 Take a second to breathe so that you can think about the problem with your brain rather than your emotions.


One great breathing exercise to help you calm down is called the "Four Square" method. Inhale in for four counts, hold it for four counts, exhale for four counts, rest for four counts, then take two normal breaths. . Repeat this as many times as you need to until you feel calm.
If your emotions are running high, chances are you will only add to the conflict.;
, If you need to, find some privacy and distance from your brother. Go to another room to think about the problem. .


Get some fresh air. Being outside and around nature is a great way to cool off.. Check in with your parents and go for a walk outside or in your backyard.
 Take twenty minutes to do something you love. Listen to a song you loveor read a chapter in a book. If you get your mind off the problem for a bit you'll be able to see things more clearly when you come back.
 Grab a notebook and write about the problem for just twenty minutes. Put all your stresses and frustrations on the page. This will help you move toward clarity and positivity more quickly .
 Younger children usually start fights with their siblings out of fear or jealousy. . Often they are just seeking attention.. Try to be sympathetic with your brother and think about what might be causing him to act the way he is.


Understanding the root of the problem can help you see it more clearly. Your brother is not trying to annoy or hurt you. Children do not know how to deal with their feelings so they often lash out.

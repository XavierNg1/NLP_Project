 The commutative property of addition states that changing the orders of the numbers doesnâ€™t affect the sum of the equation. Do the addition as follows:


a + b = c (where both a and b are positive numbers the sum c is also positive)
For example: 2 + 2 = 4;
, Do the addition as follows:


-a + -b = -c (where both a and b are negative, you get the absolute value of the numbers then you proceed to add, and use the negative sign for the sum)
For example: -2+ (-2)=-4

, Do the addition as follows:


a + (-b) = c (when your terms are of different signs, determine the larger number's value, then get the absolute value of both terms and subtract the lesser value from the larger value. Use the sign of the larger number for the answer.)
For example: 5 + (-1) = 4

, Do the addition as follows:


-a +b = c (get the absolute value of the numbers and again, proceed to subtract the lesser value from the larger value and assume the sign of the larger value)
For example: -5 + 2 = -3

, The sum of any number when added to zero, is the number itself.


An example of the additive identity is: a + 0 = a
Mathematically, the additive identity looks like: 2 + 0 = 2 or 6 + 0 = 6

, When adding the additive inverse of a number, the sum is equal to zero.


The additive inverse is when a number is added to the negative equivalent of itself.
For example: a + (-b) = 0, where b is equal to a
Mathematically, the additive inverse looks like: 5 + -5 = 0

, The order in which you add numbers does not affect their sum.


For example: (5+3) +1 = 9 has the same sum as 5+ (3+1) = 9

 Having your schedule written down is one of the best ways to ensure that you’ll keep on track. If you have easy access to your schedule, you will get in the habit of checking it regularly. Figure out which method works best for you. Then you can access your schedule when you need a reminder about what’s next on the list.


Some people prefer writing it down in a daily planner. Others like to keep track on a laptop or tablet. There are lots of useful scheduling apps for mobile phones.If you use a computer or phone to record your schedule, you can set reminders to prompt you when important tasks are coming up.
 As you start to figure out your daily schedule, break up your day into half-hour segments.These chunks of time are manageable amounts in which to accomplish certain tasks. Then you don’t need to plan your schedule down to the minute.
 You will have obligations throughout the day that need to be accomplished at specific times. For example, you need to drop off your children at school at 8:00 a.m. You need to pick them up at 3:00 p.m. Fit these types of activities into your schedule first. , After you have your obligations worked into your schedule, look for pockets of time that do not require specific activities. These are considered “flex” time. Now look at your long-term goals and start to fit activities into your schedule that will help you accomplish your goals.


The flex time can also be used for unforeseen obligations or other activities that come up last-minute.
 As you start to adjust to using a schedule, you should consult the schedule frequently. This will help remind you of your planned activities. This will also keep you on track so that you don’t spend too much time doing one activity or task.
 As you start working through your schedule every day, you can assess how it’s working for you. Make adjustments based on how much time you’re spending on different tasks.


Be sure to include your long-term goals so that you are sure to achieve them.

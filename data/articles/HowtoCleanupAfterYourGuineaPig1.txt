 If your guinea pig had an accident during floor time, it is best to wait until they are back in their cage before cleaning it up. If the mess is a bad one, cut floor time short. Put them back in the cage so that their shavings can catch any further droppings.;
, If you have a plastic scoop or spoon handy, you can scoop up any poop pellets. Normally, guinea pig droppings will be small, solid droppings, and it will be easy to pick them up. If you do not have a scoop, you can use a paper towel to pick them up. Do not touch droppings with your bare hands.
 If your guinea pig pees on a carpet, get a paper towel, and fold it over to create a thick pad. Press the towel to the carpet spot in order to soak it up. Don't try to rub it away; this causes the urine to soak deeper into the carpet.
 Once the droppings and urine have been removed, you should use a pet-safe disinfectant. You can use conventional antibacterial sprays so long as you wait a day before reintroducing your guinea pig to the area.


You can also use a solution made of equal parts white vinegar and water.
You can mix eight ounces of hydrogen peroxide with a teaspoon of dish detergent as well. Test it on a small spot of your carpet to make sure that it won't damage it., If the accident occurred on carpet, you can use baking soda to remove the stench. Sprinkle a handful of baking soda over the spot, and let it sit for fifteen to twenty minutes. Vacuum it afterwards. The smell should be gone., Before you let your guinea pig back into this area, make sure that the disinfectant has completely dried. This will prevent them from being exposed to chemicals. You may want to wait up to a full day before letting them back in the area.

 A spiral bracelet will require four pieces of hemp. Measure your wrist, and then cut two pieces of hemp that are 3x the length of your wrist. Make the other two pieces of hemp 5x the length of your wrist.
 Lay all four pieces of hemp out on a table so that the two long pieces are on the outside while the two shorter pieces are in the middle. Tie a knot on one end, keeping them in this fashion. Leave a bit of extra string on the end to use to secure the bracelet to your wrist when you are finished.
 Take the long piece on the right and fold the end over the center two pieces, forming a “D” shape.
 Take the long piece on the left, cross it over the tail of the piece from the right, and then bring it through the loop that was formed. This should create a knot around the two center strings. You will only be using the long, outer two pieces of hemp to do the knot-tying.
 Working from the right side only, continue making a loop, crossing the left string over and then under and through the loop. After a few knots you will begin to notice a spiral in your bracelet; twist it back to keep it in line as you work.
 When enough knots have been tied to create a spiral long enough to wrap around your wrist, tie a knot at the end and cut the excess pieces off. You can attach clasps to secure the bracelet to your wrist or simply tie a knot with the loose strands.

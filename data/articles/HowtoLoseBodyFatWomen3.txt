 Good foods you may want to consider adding or substituting into your diet are as follow:


Good protein sources include skinless chicken breast, ground turkey, bison, egg whites, Greek yogurt, and tofu.
Good fat sources include almonds, peanuts, flax seeds, chia seeds, fish, egg yolks, and olive oil.
Good carbohydrate sources include unprocessed carbohydrates such as sweet potatoes, brown rice, fruit, oatmeal, bran, wheat germ, Bulgarian wheat, beans, and vegetables.
 Highly processed foods include bread, pastries, pasta, fast food, and frozen prepared meals. The reason for avoiding processed food is threefold:


First, processed food is usually high in calories and low in nutrients.
Second, processed carbohydrates usually have high glycemic indexes, which means they cause insulin spikes that can promote weight gain - not what you want when trying to lose body fat.
Third, processed food usually does not contain much fiber, which can leave you feeling hungry.
 It helps to diet with the people you live with. It is easier to eat clean if you are not surrounded by temptation and bad influences. Try to enlist family and roommates to join your diet.
 Do yourself a favor and throw out any junk food in your house. It is easier to stay on your diet if tempting junk food is not in easy reach.
 Go to the store and stock up on the food you need for your diet, lean proteins, vegetables and complex carbohydrates.
 Spread your calories out throughout the day. Consider eating 5-6 small meals a day instead of just three. Also make sure to eat breakfast when you first wake up.
 Drink water with and between meals. This will help you feel fuller while dieting.
 The only way to make this diet work is to follow it. The only way you know you are following this diet, is if you record everything you eat or drink. This includes recording accurate portion sizes.


Do not estimate portion sizes, use measuring cups/spoons, or better yet weight everything.

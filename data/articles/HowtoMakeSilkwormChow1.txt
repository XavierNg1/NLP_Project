 Before you begin making your chow, you'll want to gather all the materials you'll need. The main ingredients are dried mulberry leaves, soy flour, and maize or cornmeal.Weigh out 29 ounces (822.15 grams) of mulberry leaves.
Weigh 28 ounces (793.8 grams) of soy flour.
Measure 6.1 ounces (172.935 grams) of maize/corn meal.
Do not mix the ingredients yet. You'll need to prepare the mulberry leaves first.;
, While you can feed your silkworms fresh mulberry leaves, you will need to dry and grind your leaves if you want to make chow. Make sure the leaves are completely dry before proceeding with the recipe.You can dry out your leaves in an oven or with a dehydrator.
Check that the leaves are completely dry. Any residual moisture can cause mold or bacteria to grow in the chow.
The dried leaves should be brittle and flaky to the touch.
 Once the leaves are completely dry, you'll need to grind them down into a fine powder. This powder will become the main ingredient in your powdered silkworm chow.Break the brittle leaves into small pieces.Feed the pieces of dried leaves into a coffee grinder, herb grinder, or food processor.
If there are any chunky pieces after grinding, scoop them into a fine mesh strainer and press the chunks through the mesh with the back side of a spoon.
 Once you've ground the mulberry leaves into a fine powder, you can combine them with the soy flour and corn meal. This will give you a powdered silkworm chow similar to what you would buy in stores or through an online retailer.


When you're ready to feed the chow to your silkworms, you can follow the standard powdered chow preparation instructions as you would for store-bought powder.

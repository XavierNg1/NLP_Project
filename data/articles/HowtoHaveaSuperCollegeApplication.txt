 This doesn't necessarily mean that you have to take all Honors/AP/Community College classes, but taking those show the college that you like a challenge and you want learn at a faster rate;
, Colleges, especially elite colleges (Harvard, a Service Academy, Yale) aren't going to just accept you because you only have a 4.0GPA. They want to see your character and your willingness to become involved and help others. Joining clubs that are involved in school( Sports, Debate, Dance, Glee, Honor Society, you name it), or outside of school(Scouts, Church, Community Service, Part-Time Job) shows that you are willing to do other things than academics and you are a well-rounded person.
 Don't just join activities, lead them! Being the leader shows colleges that you can take charge of something and make it do great things. This will also show that you can work with other people to get things done. Running for Club Officer, Class Officer, ASB Officer, Sport Team Captain are all great examples.
 Make sure that you get practice on these test through practice tests or books/programs that help you prepare for them. Also, take these test multiple times to get the best score. When looking at colleges, know what their scores are so you can aim for them.
 When colleges look at applications, they want to see what makes you more special than the other 100 applications they receive.
 Don't drink, do drugs, smoke, or be lazy. Make good life choices everyday, and doing the other steps will be easy. If you do drugs or drinks, you are setting yourself up for eventual academic failure. Colleges want good, solid people.

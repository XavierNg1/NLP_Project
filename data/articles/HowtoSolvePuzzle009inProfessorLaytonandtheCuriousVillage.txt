You're given an image of a dog made out of matches.
The dog was hit by a car.
You need to move two matches to show how the dog was left after he was ran over.;
, This would give you the idea that before the dog was hit, he was standing on all four legs.
 If a dog was ran over, his legs would be straight out.
 Put them on the top, to show that he is lying flat out.

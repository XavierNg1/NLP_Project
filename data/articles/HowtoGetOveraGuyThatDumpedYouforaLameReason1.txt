 Devaluing yourself as a result of the guy's breakup excuse is allowing the negative voices in your head to get the upper hand. He has used an excuse to try to get out of a relationship that he no longer wants to pursue, for his own reasons, not because you are less of a person or unworthy.;
, When you start telling yourself "If only I had..." this is a warning to stop. Nobody can reinvent the past and going over many different scenarios of how things could have been different if only you had made certain changes, spoken differently, being someone else, whatever, is unhelpful at best and destructive at worst.
 It's okay to cry and feel down temporarily. Everyone needs to let emotions through. However, don't let it drag on incessantly; life goes on, change is inevitable and Mr. Right might not see you for those swollen eyelids.


Cry indoors, away from prying eyes. If you cry in public, you will feel like you're making a fool out of yourself. If you feel like you're about to burst out in tears in the classroom or in front of his friends or siblings, quickly pop out to the bathroom, cry a little, then wash your face and get back to it.

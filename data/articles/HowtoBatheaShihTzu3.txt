 Shut off the faucet and wrap your dog in a towel. Pat the dog gently until their coat is semi-dry (i.e. not dripping). Avoid rubbing them dry, which can cause split ends., Use a blow dryer on the low heat or cool setting to dry your Shih Tzu after their bath. Have the dog lie on their side and dry their coat in layers.Use your free hand to work through hair as you blow dry.
 Once your dog is dry, brush or comb through their coat again to ensure that there are no tangles.If you encounter knots, don't tug and pull; if you combed before the bath, it should be easier to comb now. Pet and praise your dog for behaving during the bathing process.

 Launch Candy Crush and click on a level to start a game. Click the “Play” button to proceed.


A Bomb Cooler can only be in play if you have bombs on the board.;
, Work on clearing out the bombs on board. Take note of the numbers on the bombs. These represent the number of moves left before they explode.
 If you want to increase the numbers of moves left on the bombs, you can use a Bomb Cooler. This booster can be accessed from the upper-right corner of the game. Its icon is a bomb with a “+5” text on it. Click on this booster to activate it.


All the bombs on board will increase its number of moves by five.
It is advisable to use this if you think you can beat the level but have limited moves remaining because of an exploding bomb. Use only when it makes sense.
 If you run out of Bomb Coolers, you can use some Gold Bars to buy some.


Gold Bars is the currency used within the game on Facebook.
Gold Bars can only be replenished with real money.
 After using a Bomb Cooler, you can resume your game from where you left off.


It is suggested you clear out the bombs with the lowest number of moves available first, to last longer in the game.

 Each button does an action that helps the players. Here's what each button does:


Blue buttons have not been pressed. Pressing them will create a pathway for the players.
Red buttons have already been pressed. Pressing them will do nothing.
Green buttons, the most important buttons, have not been pressed. Pressing them will open the end point.
Black buttons only appear in the map Power Required. A blue button must be pressed first.
 Pressing lots of buttons will unlock a bonus stage!

, Failing to get there in time will result in you drowning. But, remember, the green button must be pressed first!

, Each stage has a different format, providing a different challenge every time.
 If the light is green, the correct combination was entered. Also, don't try to interfere with other player's work, it just makes it harder for all players.
 Although the bonus stage does not give any extra rewards, it's a gift from the game for not being selfish.
 Aesthetics make you look cooler, change sounds, and change textures. Gear provides a certain boost. Here's what they do:


Flood Shard lets you press buttons from farther away.
Dash gives you a temporary speed boost, but makes you slower when it is over.
Weak Gravity Coil lets you jump higher, but, unlike the regular Gravity Coil (from other servers) it doesn't have the hovering effect.

 A lot of bracelets and bangles are a must have and adds a bit of a twist to the look. Long necklaces and natural beads or shells are nice too. Earrings aren't that great, however dangling earrings have been making an appearance lately. Rings are also good, but again they have to be over-sized and natural colours.
, Over-sized obviously, which must include;


Phone
iPod
Keys,
Over-sized sunglasses
Purse
Bottle of vitamin water

, Belts are rarely worn, but if so, waist belts or hip belts of brown and black colours only and only ever used as a fashion statement.

 Get at least 1 yard (0.9Â m) for each page depending on what shape of calender you are making. You could make a smaller one too if you don't want to spend so much to make a bigger calendar. Also, you will need a sharpie marker, a sewing machine or sewing needle.;
, Have fun with this! You can choose anything from hearts to stars. And choose from the size of a normal size or smaller or bigger. If you make a smaller one you will not have to buy as much fabric.
 You will need this because you need two sheets for each page.
 After doing this you basically made your first month. Do this with all the other months.
 To do this you will need to cut out a top from the fabric that can fit over the top off all your sheets put together. This will hold it all together.
 If you didn't know you need to do the same to the top that you did to all the sheets by sewing two tops together right sides in. Then turning it right side out.
 you still should have 10 sheets not sewn in yet.
 Do this with all the other sheets.
 You can do this by hand sewing through the top and going under to attach the two or you could just leave it unsewn. It's not like it's going to come undone or anything!

, It's time to decorate and put your months in! Get out all your decoration supplies.
 This one is called January. It will have 31 days on it.
 You can use paint or anything you want.
 But, you are probably wondering how to write things on it! Well you can just write it on with marker or you can take small pieces of white eraser board or white plastic that you can write on with dry erase markers. Just put a piece of velcro on all the spots you will be putting this.

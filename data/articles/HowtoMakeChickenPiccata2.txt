 Deglazing is when cool liquid hits a hot pan, which loosens up all the flavorful burned bits on the pan's bottom to start a simple pan sauce or gravy. After the wine hits the pan, use a whisk or spatula to scrape up all the bits on the bottom of the pan, mixing them in. Note, however, that you do not have to use white wine if you don't desire:


You can also use 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice along with 2/3's cup chicken broth.
 The lemon is the essential flavor in this dish, and you need to add it at some point. You can either add it to the wine as a subtle flavor, or use it to deglaze the pan along with some chicken broth for a more intense kick.
 Let everything cook on medium-low for a few minutes, letting the flavors meld. Now is the time to add salt and pepper as well, seasoning and tasting regularly to ensure it is coming out well.
 Whisk it in so that it is all melted before moving on -- it shouldn't take long.
 This is especially important if you're using bigger chicken breasts that may not have cooked all the way through the first time (though you should avoid this at all costs when possible). You can slice the thickest breast open to make sure it is completely cooked, if worried.


If you're planning on serving the chicken later, don't add it to the sauce yet. It should be simmered to stay hot and meld flavors right before serving, as the chicken will get soggy if left in for too long.
Alternatively, simply pour the sauce over the chicken if you want a crunchier coating.
 A few fresh capers, a squeeze of lemon, and a dash of freshly chopped parsley would all be welcome guests on the plate as well. Top with some shaved Parmesan or Romano and you have an Italian dish worth sharing.

 Shampoo and condition your hair before you get started. You may also want to comb it with a wide-toothed comb while it is still wet to ensure that it is tangle free.


Try combing your hair in the shower while you still have conditioner in it.
 Your hair will hold the curls better if you apply some mousse or gel before you get started. Make sure that you use enough to cover your stands.


Try using a special curling hair product, such as curling mousse. This may result in better curls.
 The more braids you make, the tighter curl you will get. Plan on having at least two braids, one on each side of your head.


For a tighter curl, try doing four braids. Note that this will only leave the bottom portion of your hair curly; the hair at the top of your head will still be mostly straight.
 Again, the more braids you put in, the tighter curl you will get. One or two braids will cause thicker waves, and five or six braids will cause smaller curls.
 Part your hair down the middle, then divide each side into two sections. Secure each section with a hair tie, so that you end up with four mini ponytails. Take the hair from the bottom left section and twist it into a rope. Keep twisting it until it curls in on itself and forms a bun. Secure the bun with another hair tie or some bobby pins. Repeat this for the bottom right, and the two top sections.


You can also use a sock bun or two to create more wave-like curls.
 This could take several hours. If you are in a hurry, you can use a blow dryer on a low or medium heat setting. You will get the best curls, however, if you let your hair dry overnight.
 When you take out the braids or buns, your curls may be very tight. You can fluff them up by running your fingers through them. Avoid brushing them, or you will cause them to frizz.

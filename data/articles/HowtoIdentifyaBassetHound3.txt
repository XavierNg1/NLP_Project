 Basset Hounds are notorious for being pleasant and laid back. While some act regal from time to time, most would make a better jester. Whatever their personality, they are reliably peaceful, and are quicker than many breeds to wag their tails. That said, they also have a stubborn streak when it comes to training.In particular, these dogs are less keen to “come back” than many others. If you take a Basset Hound outside, make sure they are in a fenced in area or on a leash at all times.
 From the perspective of a dog owner (prospective or otherwise), Basset Hounds have a few characteristics you may be looking for. They are a strong, good-sized breed of dog that can keep up on jogs and like to exercise, despite their appearance.They are one of the most friendly breeds, and get along with people, other dogs, and even cats. If these are traits you’re looking for, a Basset Hound may be right for you.
 Every breed of dog has some characteristics that are not ideal. If you’re considering getting a Basset Hound, make sure none of their classic characteristics are too prevalent for you to put up with. Foremost, anticipate an independent, slow-to-listen attitude that will prolong training, including housebreaking. Expect plenty of slobbering and drooling, not to mention audible snoring and a good deal of shedding.
You’ll hear a fair amount of baying and howling, especially when the dog is bored.
Finally, be aware that you’ll smell them - both the odor of their coats and their gassy digestion is well renowned.

 You can use a Q-tip or a cotton ball to apply your chosen essential oil directly on the infected ingrown hair, but if you have sensitive skin, you may need to dilute the oil with a "carrier oil" like coconut oil (especially with oils like tea tree, which can be particularly harsh on the skin). You can leave the essential oil on or rinse it off with warm water after at least 30 minutes. Find a homeopath to assist you in choosing which oil will be best for you. Some essential oils to try include:Tea tree oil
Eucalyptus
Peppermint oil
Orange oil
Garlic oil
Clove oil
Lime oil
Rosemary oil
Geranium oil
Lemon oil

, Mix ½ teaspoon of baking soda or sea salt with 1–2 tablespoons (14.8–29.6 ml) of olive oil, which has antibacterial properties of its own. Use a Q-tip or cotton ball to apply the mixture to the infected ingrown hair.


Use the tip of one or two fingers to gently rub in the exfoliating mixture using circular motions. First rub in using three to five clockwise motions and then reverse, using three to five counterclockwise motions. Rinse off with warm water and pat dry. Wash your hands and put the towel in with the laundry to prevent spreading the infection. Repeat twice a day.
Remember to be very gentle and to use gentle, circular motions to dislodge the hair. Scars can form after particularly vigorous exfoliation because exfoliation can irritate and damage already sensitive skin.
Also keep in mind that infections take time to heal. If the ingrown hair appears to be getting better, continue treatment until it is resolved. If it is not improving, see your medical provider.
 Use a cotton swab to apply the honey onto the infected ingrown hair and allow it to remain for five to 10 minutes. Rinse off with warm water and pat dry — wash your hands and put the towel in with the laundry to prevent spreading the infection. Repeat twice a day.


Don't use this remedy if you are sensitive to honey.

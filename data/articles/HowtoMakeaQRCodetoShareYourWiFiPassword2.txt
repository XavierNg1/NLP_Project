While the website says this option is only available for Android phones, it is actually usable by other phone platforms, too. On Android with certain QR scanner apps, the phone can connect directly to the WiFi network upon scanning. On other phones, you'll have to copy and paste the password into your WiFi settings menu, but it's still an easy option!

, Put the name of your network in the SSID field, enter the password carefully, and specify the network type (WEP, WPA/WPA2, or non-encrypted) from the drop-down box.


If you want the QR code to be a color other than black, you can also select a different color at this stage from the "Foreground Colour" menu.
 You may want to double-check the network name and password before you download it!


Alternatively, you can select "Print" straight from QRStuff.com, but it will print a template with the QR code repeated several times on one page. If you only need one print-out, download it first and print it from your computer.

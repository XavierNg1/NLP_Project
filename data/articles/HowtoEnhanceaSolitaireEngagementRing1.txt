 In a halo setting, the center solitaire is surrounded with a collection of pave or micro pave gemstones or diamonds. The surrounding gemstones or diamonds create a halo effect for the center stone and flash with light to create a dazzling effect.;
, You can choose diamond (white or color) or other gemstones to be fixed at the center, depending on your budget and preferences. The cut of the stone can be the classic round or princess if desired; however, the modern-style cuts like emerald, asscher or cushion offers an extra dazzling touch.
 You can choose contrasting or complementary halo stones. For example, blue sapphires or rubies surrounding a white diamond will create a contrasting effect while diamonds bordering a solitaire diamond in the ring can create a complementary effect.
 Since this is a quest to add more and more bling to your solitaire engagement ring, you can double or even triple the number of halos if you'd like. Each “circle” surrounding the center will make the ring go bigger and bigger and will amplify the dazzle of the ring.

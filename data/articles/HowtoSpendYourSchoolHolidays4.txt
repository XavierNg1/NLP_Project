 Whether you are just helping clean up a local park or traveling across an ocean to build houses, volunteering can be an amazing experience. You can learn a lot about the world and what you can do to make it better. It will look pretty impressive on your college applications and resume as well.All you have to do is call or email a local organization you'd like to help and ask what you can do.
 Getting experience in your field is a valuable way to spend your time away from school. You will get to learn skills that are important to your future employment and make contacts in your field. It’s never too early to start building up your resume.


It's best to start looking to line up an internship before your summer starts, especially if you are hoping to get a better position or a paid internship. There are always opportunities out there though. Just check web classifieds and job posting sites to see the possibilities.
 Making money is a great way to have a productive holiday. Whether it is summer break or winter break, most employers are going to need some extra seasonal help. If you aren’t old enough to get a job yet, don’t let that stop you. You can make some extra money by doing yard work around the neighborhood.
 If you found a bunch of stuff you don't want while cleaning your room, you can sell it in a garage sale. The extra money will come in handy once school starts back up and you have less time for work.


If you have nice stuff that just isn't your style, you can make a little more cash by selling them through consignment shops or online auction houses.

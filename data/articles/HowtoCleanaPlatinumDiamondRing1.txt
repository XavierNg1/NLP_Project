 Fill a bowl of water about 3/4 full with warm water. Add a few drops of a gentle dish soap such as Dawn. Soak the jewelry for at least a 30 minutes for a good result.The dish soap will make the ring slippery, so if there is a sink you are using, make sure that the drain is plugged.;
, If you have sensitive skin, you may want to wear gloves. Use a clean, soft-bristled toothbrush to be used only for cleaning your jewelry. Wet the toothbrush in the solution. Clean the ring over the bowl, using gentle circular motions.Pay special attention to places that are hard to reach, like the inside of the setting and undersides of the diamonds.
 Allow the ring to air dry. Alternatively, you can use a soft, dry lint-free cloth to remove moisture from the ring. If you’re in a hurry, you can blow-dry it.If you’re allowing the ring to air dry, place it somewhere safe on a dry lint-free cloth. Don’t put it somewhere it can be easily knocked down, like on the edge of a counter. Don’t set it near a sink with an unplugged drain.

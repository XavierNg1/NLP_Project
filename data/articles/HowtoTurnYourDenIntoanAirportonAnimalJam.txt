 Something like a small house den for the airport and another small house den for the airplane.;
, For the airport, put in a rectangular coffee table, tree stump chair, and computer for the flight booking manager. That is where you will set up the day someone will get on the plane.
 Put in couches, bookshelves, toys, and plushies. This is where people will wait for their plane to arrive back.
 Add lots of mats and bamboo fences for the seats, a bamboo fence, tree stump chair, and sink for the bathroom, and a duck pillow for where the pilot will sit and guide the plane.
 Say, "Airport at my den! Come and go to where you please!" Once enough people are there, go back to your den. You should already have a janitor, pilot, and flight booking manager.

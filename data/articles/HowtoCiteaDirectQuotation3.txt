 Use this method if you are quoting fewer than 40 words within your text.
 Then place the page number that you are referencing, preceded by “p.” in parentheses after the quotation, and before punctuation that is not part of the quotation.


If the author’s name is not mentioned in an introductory phrase, include the author’s last name, the year of publication and the page number in parentheses after the quotation.

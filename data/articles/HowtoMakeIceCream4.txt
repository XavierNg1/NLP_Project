 For the ice cream, you’ll need a stainless steel 9-inch by 5-inch by 3-inch (23-cm by 13-cm by 8 cm) loaf pan. Place it in the freezer, and allow it to chill for at least an hour., Add a 14-ounce (396 g) can of sweetened condensed milk, 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of pure vanilla extract, and a pinch of fine salt to a medium bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they’re fully blended, and then set the mixture aside., Pour 2 cups (473 ml) of cold heavy cream into the bowl of a stand mixer. Use medium-high speed to whip the cream until stiff peaks form, which should take about 5 minutes.For the best results, chill the stand mixer bowl in your refrigerator for 15 to 20 minutes.
You can use an electric hand mixer or whip the cream by hand if you prefer.
 After you’ve whipped the cream, spoon about half of it into the bowl with the condensed milk mixture. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the whipped cream into the mixture until it is just incorporated.Be careful not to overmix the mixture or you’ll take some of the air out of the cream.
 Once you’ve lightened the condensed milk mixture with some of the whipped cream, spoon it into the bowl with the rest of the whipped cream. Fold the two together until they’re well blended., Use the rubber spatula to help transfer all of the ice cream mixture into the chilled pan. Cover it with a pieces of plastic wrap, making sure that it’s airtight., Place the pan in the freezer, and allow it to freeze until it reaches the consistency of soft-serve, which should take approximately 2 hours. If you’d like to add any cookies, nuts, candy, or other mix-ins, stir them in until they’re incorporated., Cover the pan once more, and return it to the freezer. Let the ice cream freeze for another 3 hours, or until it is solid and able to be scooped.

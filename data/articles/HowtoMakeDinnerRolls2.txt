 In 1/2 cup of warm water, dissolve your yeast -- right in the glass measuring cup. Set aside while you move onto creating the dough.
 A stand mixer is best -- that thing is literally going to be your bread and butter. Without it, you'll be mixing till the cows come home. Which is, for the record, a long ways away.
 Add the milk and yeast mixture, still stirring. Make sure it's all evenly and thoroughly combined.
 Change to the dough hook and knead for 2-3 minutes only -- just until no longer tacky, adding a tablespoon or two of flour, if needed to sop up any extra moisture. Stick your finger in it -- if there's a bit of stick and a bit of residue, you're in the bread zone.
 It needs time to rise and the yeast to take action. When the time is up, place it on a floured surface and knead it a couple of times, then let it rest for 3 more minutes.


Plastic wrap works well, though you can also throw a towel over it if you're in a pinch.
 They should be divided into 24 equal pieces and the pieces should be touching. Don't worry -- they'll get bigger!


You can grease or spray the pan, too, for the record.
 This is the second round of rising the dough needs to go through to reach the appropriate size. Leave it on the counter or on the stove while you go about your day.
 When they're finished, take them out of the oven and brush a thing layer of butter on the tops of the rolls to give them that perfectly done, golden sheen. And then serve!

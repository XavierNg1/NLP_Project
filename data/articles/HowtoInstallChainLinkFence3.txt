 Post holes should be dug 3 times the width and one-third the length of the post, with an extra 4 inches (10.2 cm) for gravel. Slope the sides so that the hole is wider at the bottom than at the top.
 Tamp down the gravel to provide a compact foundation for the posts and concrete.
 Mark the side of the post at ground level using a marker or chalk. The height above the line should equal the height of the fence mesh, plus 2 inches (5.1 cm).
 Using a carpenter's level or plumb line, position the post until its plumb.
 Using clamps and pieces lumber angled into the ground, brace the post in its plumb position.
 Pour or shovel concrete around the post. Smooth the surface with a trowel or small piece of wood, sloping away from the post to direct water elsewhere.
 Allow time for the concrete to set, according to manufacturer's recommendations.

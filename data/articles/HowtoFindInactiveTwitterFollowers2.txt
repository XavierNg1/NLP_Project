 You can open the app by tapping on the icon that has a blue box and the trademark white Twitter bird, which can be found on your deviceâ€™s home screen or app drawer.
 Enter your Twitter handle in the second box and then your password into the second box. Tap the login button to load your profile.
 Tap the 3-dot icon at the top right side of the screen to open the app menu. Tap your profile picture at the top of the menu to load your profile page.
 A page will load displaying all your followers.
 Once you find someone, tap their name to access their profile.
 Now look through their profile to see if they are really inactive. You can tell a couple of different ways. First, look and see if they posted anything recently. You should also make sure they are retweeting and following new people. Seeing this is a sure sign of activity. If they did not, it might be time to unfollow them.
 Tapping the box will help you unfollow the inactive follower.

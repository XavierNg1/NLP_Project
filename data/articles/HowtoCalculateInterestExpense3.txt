 If you borrowed money to operate a business, interest expense should be posted to your accounting records. This applies to both simple interest and compound interest calculations.
 The accrual method recognizes revenue when it is earned and expenses when they are incurred. This accounting method matches revenue with expenses. It is a better indicator of company profit than the cash method of accounting. The cash method recognizes revenue when cash is received. Expenses are posted when cash is paid.Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires most businesses to use the accrual method of accounting. Companies of all sizes can benefit from conforming with GAAP.
 Assume, for example, that you need to post $100 of interest for the month of December. Also assume that you will pay the December interest on January 15th of the following year.

 On the last day of the month (December 31st), you would post one month of interest as interest expense.

 Your accounting entry on 12/31 is to debit (increase) interest expense $100 and to credit (increase) interest payable $100.

 On January 15th, when interest is paid, you would debit (reduce) interest payable $100 and credit (reduce) cash $100.

 The cash method would require you to post the interest expense when cash is paid (January 15th). The $100 of interest expense should be posted in December, since that is the time period when the interest was incurred.

 Interest expense is posted to the income statement with other expenses. The income statement formula is (revenue less expenses equals net income).

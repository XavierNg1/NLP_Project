 Before you can apply to be certified as a master parachute rigger, you must have been rigging parachutes for at least 3 years and have packed 100 parachutes of 2 different rating types.
 An inspector from the FAA will review your evidence of packing experience and additional qualifications to determine your eligibility to take the 2 or 3 tests that are required for master parachute rigger certification.
 At the end of this process, you will receive an Airman's Authorization for Written Test or be allowed to take the both the oral test and the practical test.
, These tests usually require advance arrangements and may be administered by an FAA inspector or a DPRE. Both tests include sections on packing parachutes and maintaining parachutes.

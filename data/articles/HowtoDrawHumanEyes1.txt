 Make sure you have a Number 2 pencil and a good notebook. When you are drawing you must remember to draw lightly, just in case you have to erase.;
, When you are drawing the upper part of the eye, you must arc it.
 Do what you did for step two but make it upside down.
 Draw a circle, lightly, inside what you drew. It doesn't have to be perfect. Just make sure the top of the circle touches the top arc, and the lower part of the circle touches the lower arc.
 This mini circle does NOT touch the bigger circle at all. Make sure you make it dark.
 Drawing the lashes does take some practice. But, all it is, is shading. But this shading you have nothing telling you what to shade. You must decide how long the lashes are, how dark they are...and so on.

Although entry requirements will be different depending on the school or university you attend, you'll probably need 5 GCSEs (General Certificate of Secondary Education) of Grade C and above. This should include English literature or language and a science subject.If you're taking a degree program, you'll probably need to have at least 2 A-Level qualifications.;
, Once you've completed any pre-registration programs, you'll need to decide on your specialty. You can choose any nursing specialty (such as adult, child, learning disability or mental health) to become a registered nurse. If you have any previous medical experience, talk with the admissions office about whether any credits will apply towards your program.


Most nursing programs take about 3 years to complete.

 Standing water can damage the underlying adhesive that secures the rubber to your floor. Be diligent about wiping up any spills or standing water right away to keep your rubber crack-free and in good condition.
 Vacuuming your rubber floor every other day will help minimize surface dirt and keep your floor looking bright and new. Less grit on your floors means fewer surface scratches. Mop with soap and water as directed once a week.


Creating a calendar reminder can help you remember to clean your floor regularly.
 Rubber floors harden over time, which actually makes them more resistant to dirt and wear as they age. To extend the life of your rubber floor, try to take particularly diligent care of it during the first 6-12 months by vacuuming and mopping as scheduled.

 You can simply lay the patch over the hole, then iron it flat with enough heat that the patch binds to the fabric. Make sure to reinforce an iron-on patch with stitching around the edges. Trim the square corners to a rounded shape before ironing them onto the garment. Both the stitching and the corner trimming will increase the useful life of the patch.Iron-on patches are suitable for heavier fabrics such as denim and canvas. However, they may distort the shape of thinner fabrics.
 If the hole is in a visible part of the garment, prepare the self patch from the inside. If this isn't possible, purchase fabric as close in color to the garment as possible in a fabric with the same properties.Alternately, pick a patch that stands out. For some, patched clothing is a stylistic choice.
 First, trim the frayed threads and treat the hole's edges with seam sealant. Make two patches: one with any fabric for the bottom, and one with the matching/self fabric for the top patch.Treat the edges of the bottom patch with seam sealant. Then, turn a small amount of fabric at the edge of your top patch, and iron this folded edge in place.


Use the free embroidery settings on your sewing machine. Place the bottom patch underneath the hole, and run the lines of stitching very close together to completely catch all edges of the hole onto the bottom patch.
Sew the bottom patch into place. Stitch back and forth, and up and down, creating a "fabric" of stitching across the hole or tear. Sew in straight stitch all around the edges of the bottom patch to keep the hole reinforced.
Cover with the top patch. Place the folded-edge side down onto the fabric so it completely covers all the machine stitching. Hand-sew with matching thread (applique style) onto the top of the garment. Work the thread around it several times for strength. If you prefer a "rustic" look, you can also embroider with blanket stitch around this patch.

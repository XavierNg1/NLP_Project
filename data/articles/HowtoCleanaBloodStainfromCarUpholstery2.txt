 Mix 1 tablespoon of liquid dish washing detergent with 2 cups of cold water in a large bowl to make a detergent solution., Soak a clean, white cloth with your dish detergent/cold water solution and apply it to the affected area.
 A normal sized scrub brush might cause you to scrub too vigorously, pushing the stain deeper into the fabric. Using a toothbrush will keep you from brushing too hard, which might cause the stain to spread or permanently set into your upholstery.
 With a clean, wet cloth, rinse the solution using dabbing motions. For stubborn stains, re-apply your solution and scrub it again with your toothbrush. When you have finished scrubbing, you should rinse the area again with a clean, wet cloth.
 This time, using a cloth wet with cold water, rinse the remaining solution out of your upholstery. Rinse thoroughly with dabbing motions.
 Use a cloth towel to dry the area, pull out the excess moisture by blotting the towel to it until most of the moisture is removed.

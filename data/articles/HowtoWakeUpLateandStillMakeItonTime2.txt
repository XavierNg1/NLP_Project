 When a person first wakes up, they experience what’s known as sleep inertia,which interferes with a person’s ability to do basic tasks efficiently.You should allot extra time to basic things like getting dressed and brushing your teeth, as these tasks take longer to complete than if you were completely awake and alert. Make sure to constantly have an eye on a clock so that you can determine if you are running late on a certain task.


Break the morning into small, identifiable tasks. You should set a time restriction for each thing you have to do in the morning when you wake up. Limit your time on the other things you need to do.
 If you choose your outfit the night before it will eliminate extra time spent searching for something to wear. If you work in a professional environment make sure that your clothes are pressed and ready to be worn the night before.


Remember to put things like your car keys or bus pass in the same place every night so you don't waste time looking for them.
If you need to bring things with you to your appointment like paperwork or notes, make sure that you organize them the night before.
 Distractions make us less efficient and effective at tasks.Even simple things like having a television on or answering text messages could make us take longer to do certain things. Eliminate all distractions to maximize your time.


Even if having the television on in the background is a habit, refrain from doing it if you are late. You don’t want anything to be able to divert your attention from getting to where you need to go.

 Unless the puppy came from a pet store, it will rarely urinate where it sleeps. Getting your corgi accustomed to the crate is the best way to care for your corgi when you can’t be with it.


Do not leave young corgis in a crate for more than two hours., If the crate is too large, a puppy might go the bathroom at one end and sleep in the other. This is not only a pain to clean, but unsanitary for the dog.If you want a big crate for the dog to grow into, buy a divider to limit the space it can use when it is small.
 To keep your corgi comfortable, fold a thick blanket or purchase a dog pillow for the bottom of your crate. Use one you can clean in the washing machine following an accident., This may be difficult to do if the dog is complaining, but it takes some time for a corgi to get used to its crate. Give your dog time – if you remove it when it whines, you will have a hard time coaxing it back in.


In time, your dog will become accustomed to its new home.
 Provide positive reinforcement to your dog, so it associates its crate with comfort and love.
 Cooped up, your corgi has likely been holding back from peeing or pooping since you put it in the crate. Take you dog out for a walk so it gets fresh air and the chance to relieve itself.

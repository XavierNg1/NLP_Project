 Enter the Boss Room of these levels by unlocking it using the Boss Keys you acquired while playing through the dungeons. Gohma can be found in the Boss Rooms of the following levels:


The Legend of Zelda (first version) – Guards the Boss Room of the “Dragon Labyrinth” (level 6 dungeon).
Link’s Awakening – Guards the Boss Room of the “Catfish’s Maw” (level 5 dungeon).
Ocarina of Time – Can be found inside the Great Deku Tree (level 1).
Oracle of Seasons – Guards the Boss Room of the “Dancing Dragon Dungeon” (level 4 dungeon).
Four Swords – Guards the Mini Boss Room of various dungeons.
Twilight Princess – Guards the Boss Room of the Temple of Time level.;
, Once you get inside the Boss Room, Gohma will start attacking you using its two front limbs. To dodge this attack, simply run around the Boss Room and you’ll easily evade Gohma’s claws.
 After three or more consecutive claw or leg attacks, Gohma will then blow a pillar of fire at you. This fire breath will last around 3 seconds and will follow you wherever you go, so just keep running around the room (like what you’ve been doing in step 2) until the fire breath stops.
 After attacking you with its fire breath, Gohma will pause for at least three seconds, letting its guard down. Quickly turn around and shoot at the spider’s singular eye using your bow and arrow.


After damaging its eye, Gohma will resume attacking you again. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you get the chance to shoot its eye again. Keep doing this for at least five times or more until you defeat the monster.

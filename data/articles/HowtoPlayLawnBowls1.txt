 The patch should be relatively flat and each side must measure between 37 and 44 yards (34 and 40 meters). This bowling green should also be divided into six equal sections, called rinks.;
, The ditch defines the end of the green. Surround the outside of the ditch with a bank. The bank should be about 9 inches (23Â cm) (230 mm) higher than the level of the bowling green.
 A pin should be placed at the center of each rink, and each pin should be numbered according to the rink number. The numbering system goes from one through six. Note that these pins are not the target. They merely exist to set the boundary of the rink.

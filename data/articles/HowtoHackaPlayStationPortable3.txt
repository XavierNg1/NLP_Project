 Scroll to the Game menu. Find the icon for “PRO Update” and select it with the X button. The screen will go black and a few options will be listed. Press X to install the firmware. After a moment, you will get a Completed message. Press X again to start to firmware.
 For PSP 1XXX and 2XXX, you will need to launch the “CIPL Flasher,” found in the Game menu. This will change the IPL (Initial Program Loader), which will set your custom firmware to launch when the system boots.
 For PSP 3XXX and PSP Go, you will need to run Fast Recovery after each boot, because the IPL cannot be flashed on these systems. Running Fast Recovery will load your custom firmware after booting.
 After flashing the IPL, your PSP is hacked and ready to go. You can delete the CIPL Flasher and PRO Update files. Be sure to keep Fast Recovery if running 3XXX or PSP Go.

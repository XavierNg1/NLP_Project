 You are more likely to meet new people if you go to places where there are a lot of people. Look for public events in your area that you are interested in going to. This will help you get involved in as well as meet people in your area.Try starting out with small events or visit places that you are already familiar with to help yourself feel more comfortable.
Try to find an art gallery opening, a lecture, a music recital, or a book reading in your town and talk to new people there.
 Another way to meet new people is to volunteer.Find a cause in your area that interests you or a kind of volunteer work that you're interested in doing. This will help you meet to new people who care about the same things you do. Try to talk to the other people who are also volunteering so you can make friends.


This has the added benefit of helping others as well helping you meet people.
 When you have a psychotic disorder, you may want to join a support group for people with your disorder. This will put you with a group of people who understand what you are going through and can help you get through hard times. You might also make some good friends in your support group.


Ask your therapist about support groups in your area for people with psychotic disorder.
 A good place to make new friends is at work.You see your coworkers every day and work closely with them on projects or on tasks. If you want to turn some of your working relationships into friendships, then reach out.


Try asking a coworker if he or she would be interested in getting coffee or seeing a movie with you. You can say something like, “Hey Chris, what are you up to this Saturday? I was think about checking out that new café on 5th street. Want to go get a cup of coffee with me?”

, Walking your dog can also be a good way to meet new friends.When your dog stops to play with another dog, try to talk to the other dog owners and get to know them. In these situations, the dogs act as a buffer for the interactions and provide you an ally if you feel uncomfortable.


Try starting a conversation with someone who has a dog by saying something like, “Cute dog! What breed is she?”

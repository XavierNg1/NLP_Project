 You might want to use a normal-sized flowerpot for one plant or you can even establish several cuttings in the same pot, planted apart from each other. Seedling tubes are also a good idea for many plants.
 Get a plastic (polythene bag) and place gravel at the base of the bag. The pot will be placed in here after you have made the cutting. Fill the pot with suitable soil - sand and peat for drainage make an ideal combination for many plants. Finally, the pot must be able to drain well (the water will go onto the gravel, rather than pooling in the plastic bag).
 Cut it off just below a leaf or joint (node).
 Once you have cut the plant piece, strip or cut off any leaves on the lower half. You can strip or cut off as high as two-thirds if necessary. If the bark looks like it will tear, use scissors. You can also make a small incision to the lower end of the stem to encourage root growth from this "wound".
 Use a skewer, pencil, or similar long object to create a hole for the cutting to sit in. Do not use the cutting itself to push in a hole or you will damage it. The idea is to gently drop the cutting into the hole and carefully in-fill with dirt.
 Make sure the pot is sitting snugly on the gravel.
 This makes it easy to undo for watering and to place back on again.

 This should break the mouth's grip on the nipple, as well as interfere with feeding. It might feel natural to pull away from pain, but gently inserting a finger into the baby’s mouth will be more comfortable for you. Your baby will learn that their feeding gets interrupted when they bite.
 When removing your baby from your breast, hug them closer in towards your breast rather than pulling them off of you. The baby will briefly not be able to breathe with their face against the breast, forcing them to release your nipple without injury to either of you., This is a negative feedback system, telling your baby that if they bite, they don’t get to nurse.Try nursing again in a few minutes.


Notice that if you stop feeding and your baby doesn’t cry or seems disinterested after a few minutes, they may not need to feed more. This might indicate that they were biting out of boredom or because they were full.
 Do your best to remain calm, and not to cry out or yell at your baby when they bite you. This may scare them away from nursing for a while, or cause them to bite even more out of fear or anxiety. It’s also possible that your baby will enjoy your strong reaction, and it may drive them to bite again out of amusement., While a younger baby might not catch on to this hint, they will eventually understand its meaning, especially if you stop nursing for a few minutes afterward.Consistently tell your baby “no” when they bite and do not let them nurse if they are biting, and eventually they will learn the command and will stop biting without you discontinuing the feeding.

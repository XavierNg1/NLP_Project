 Mattresses wear down over time and provide less support as they deteriorate. Replacing your mattress when necessary is particularly important if you already have back problems.Replacing a mattress as recommended can reduce back pain and improve sleep quality by approximately 50 percent., Even the best mattress is no substitute to proper sleeping posture. Use a head pillow that doesnâ€™t elevate your neck and head too much. Your ears, shoulders, and hips should form a straight line, whether you sleep on your side or on your back., If you sleep on your back, place a pillow under the backs of your knees to elevate them slightly. If you sleep on your side, place a pillow between your knees.If you experience lower back pain, you can purchase an adjustable lumbar support pillow or use a small rolled towel. Place it under your lower spine and sleep on your back., Sleeping on your stomach worsens existing back problems, twists the neck, and causes sway back. If possible, vary your positions between sleeping on your back and on each side to avoid putting too much pressure on your joints and vertebrae.The best sleeping position depends on your specific back problems. For example, sleeping on your side can help relieve degenerative or herniated disks, depending on where they're located on your spine. Sleeping on your back with your knees elevated with several pillows can ease other conditions, like hip and sacroiliac pain.
Ask your doctor or spine specialist to recommend the best sleeping posture for your specific back problems.

 Set your large piece of scrap paper, like a place mat, in front of you. Place your cardstock in the middle of the scrap paper. Lay out your cardstock so the surface you want to emboss on is faced upward.
 Look at the stamp to make sure the surface of the stamp is completely covered with the embossing solution from the pad. Firmly press the stamp onto the desired spot on the cardstock.Find a happy medium with the amount of ink you use to cover the surface of the stamp. Too much ink can make the design appear blurred once stamped onto the paper.To ensure a crisp image, carefully lift the stamp straight up. Clean the stamp by wiping any leftover embossing solution off with a damp rag.
 When pressing the stamp against the paper, make sure that level pressure is applied firmly to the stampâ€™s back to ensure an even application. Follow the stamping up with embossing powder., Lift the card so any embossing powder that did not adhere to the stamped area can fall to the paper below.


You may need to lightly tap the card. Return this unused powder to its container to be used again. Sit your card back down.
Use your paint brush to dust off any embossing granules that remain on the card outside the stamped design.
 Plug in your heat gun and hold it a couple inches away from the card. Move it around above the powdered area. The heat will begin to transform the powder into a raised, shiny coating.Pay attention not to get the heat too close to the card or hold it in one place too long as it can scorch the card and ruin the embossing.
Be careful not to burn yourself with the heat gun or with the finished embossed design. Allow it to cool for at least 30 seconds before touching it.

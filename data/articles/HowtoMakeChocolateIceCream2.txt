 You can use either chocolate syrup or cocoa powder. Chocolate syrup will give you a much sweeter ice cream than cocoa powder.
 This will take about 3 minutes.You can do it with an electric mixer or in a food processor fitted with whisks. You can also do it by hand with a whisk, although it will take much longer.
 Measure out a scoop of the whipped cream, and add it to the condensed milk. Gently stir the two together. This will "lighten" the condensed milk, and make it easier to mix later on.
 It will look a little lumpy at first, but just keep folding. Stop when there are just a few lumps left. You don't want to over-mix your ice cream, or the whipped cream will "deflate" and turn flat.
 This is not completely necessary for the recipe, but it will give your ice cream a little extra crunch., The best type of container to use would be an 8-inch (20.32 centimeters) baking loaf tin, but you can use a plastic container as well. Use a rubber spatula to smooth the mixture down, or gently shake the container side to side.









The shallower the container, the better; the ice cream will freezer faster in a shallow container.
 To prevent ice crystals from forming on top of the ice cream, press a sheet of wax paper over the surface of the ice cream.The ice cream should be frozen in about 6 hours., If the ice cream is too hard to scoop, let it sit on the counter for 5 minutes. Store any leftovers in the freezer; they will last for up to two weeks.

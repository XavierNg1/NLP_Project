 If you’re sitting in class or work all day, you may be fine with your everyday primer. However, if you’re headed to a packed party or to an outdoor lunch, your makeup may slide off your face by the end! Use a sweat-resistant primer to make sure it stays put. These primers are meant to resist water and sweat, and will help your makeup stay in place despite the conditions., If you don’t wear much or any eyeshadow, you are absolutely fine applying your normal makeup primer to your entire face. However, if you spend a good deal of time on an elaborate smoky eye, you may want to invest in an eye-specific primer. These will prevent your eyeshadows from creasing or fading, helping your eyelid artwork last all day and night., If you want your skin to look beautiful, you need to protect it from the sun. A makeup primer with SPF is great year-round, but especially during the summer months. The higher the SPF the better! For added protection on really sunny days, skip the primer and use sunscreen underneath your makeup.

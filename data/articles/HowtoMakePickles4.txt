 Here's what you'll need to make garlic dill pickles:


3 lbs. kirby cucumbers
1½ cups apple cider vinegar
1½ cups filtered water
2 tbsp. pickling salt
8 peeled garlic cloves
4 tsp. dill seed
2 tsp. black peppercorns
1 tsp. red chili flakes

, kirby cucumbers. Cut them into spears. Remove the blossom end. , Combine 1½ cups apple cider vinegar, 1½ cups filtered water, and 2 tablespoon (29.6 ml). pickling salt in a saucepan. Bring this mixture to a boil.
 dill seed, 2 tsp. black peppercorns, and 1 tsp. red chili flakes between two quart jars. If you don't have two quart jars, you can use four pint jars instead.
 You should pack them in as tightly as you can without crushing them.
 Leave just 1/4 inch of space above the surface of the brine and the rim of the jar. You can gently tap the jars to remove any air bubbles. Air bubbles can damage the pickling process.
 Place the lids on the jars, but don't screw them on too tightly -- the mixture needs to breathe a bit.
 Wait at least 10-15 minutes for the jars to cool down.
 You should let the pickles sit in the refrigerator for at least a week for best results.
 Serve the pickles as a side to any meal, or enjoy them as a snack at any time.

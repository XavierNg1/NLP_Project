 Find the Drop Shield andÂ rocket launcher.;
, Aim for the heads. Shoot until you run out of ammo.
 Fight until they start to swarm you. Retreat to the tower with the machine gun turrets.
 Once they start to converge on you, detach them and open fire.
 Once the Energy Sword Elites arrive, obliterate them with the rocket launcher. Grab the Energy Sword and go straight back to the tower.
 You will survive until you are ready to just give up out of boredom.

 Under the ☰ dropdown menu, choose "Help" and then "Restart with Add-ons Disabled."

, Once the window entitled "Firefox Safe Mode" appears, select "Start in Safe Mode." This will temporarily turn off things like add-ons, extensions, themes, etc. in order to troubleshoot Firefox and when you restart Firefox in normal mode, these things will be returned.

 Place a pillow between your knees. Lay your top arm across your side and thigh. Bring your bottom arm (the arm on which you are lying) straight out from your shoulder and wrap it around your pillow, with your palm facing you.


You can sleep on either your left or right side.
 This will help you keep your lower back curved properly. For additional support, roll a small towel and place it beneath your lower back. Rest your head and neck on a pillow.


Lying on your back and lying on your side when sleeping are equally good positions for avoiding back pain.
 Normally, you should avoid sleeping on your stomach, since it can be hard on your back; however, you can make it easier on your back by putting a pillow beneath your pelvis and lower part of your abdomen. If you can use a pillow without straining your back, do so. Otherwise, sleep without a pillow under your head.

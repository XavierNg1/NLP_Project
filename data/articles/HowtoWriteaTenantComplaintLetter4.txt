 If there are general improvements that need to be made to a rental building to make it more habitable, consider holding a tenants’ meeting to discuss the matter. At the meeting you should discuss the need for large-scale repairs, such as replacing all of the windows or a continually out of service elevator, and vote on the most important repairs needed in the building. By having a consensus, the tenants are in a much stronger bargaining position than if one tenant requested improvements.
 Once the demands have been agreed upon, one tenant should draft a petition that outlines the requests for specific improvements and contains signature pages for tenants to add their names and apartment numbers.


The petition should be posted in a common area to maximize tenants reviewing and signing the document.
The petition can also be circulated at tenants’ meetings or other gatherings.
A person could also go door-to-door soliciting support from other tenants in the building.
 Once you have gathered a significant number of signatures, you should draft a letter to the landlord requesting the improvements. You should attach the petition and signatures of the tenants to the letter. In addition, the letter should include:


A polite request for the landlord to make the improvements and/or repairs.
A specific date by which the landlord should respond to the request.
An explanation of why the tenants believe the repairs are necessary.
If this is the first request for improvements, it may not be in the tenants’ best interest to threaten repercussions if the landlord fails to act. However, the letter should be firmly worded so that the landlord takes the request seriously.
The letter should be sent via certified mail and a copy should be maintained by the tenants association or by the person spearheading the petition.You can view a sample petition letter at: http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/sample-group-petition-landlord-repairs-property-improvements.html.

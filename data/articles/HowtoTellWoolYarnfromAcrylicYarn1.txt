 It sounds obvious, but this will be the most reliable and accurate way to find out. The label will tell you what the yarn is made out of: wool, acrylic, cotton, and so forth.;
, Wool yarn tends to be much softer than acrylic yarn. Acrylic yarn tends to feel a little coarse. This is easier if you have another yarn that you know is wool or acrylic to use as comparison.


The touch test is not very reliable. Many acrylic yarns can feel soft and silky. A soft and silky texture can also indicate silk or rayon, instead of wool.
 Acrylic yarn may feel rough, but it won't look hairy. Wool yarn may have some longer fibers sticking out of it. Keep in mind that acrylic-wool blends may also have some hairy fibers. Yarn made from other natural fibers may also have a hairy look to it.
 If you can't find what the yarn is made out of on the label, look at the price; it may be a good indicator of whether or not the yarn is real wool. Acrylic yarn tends cost much less than wool yarn. Keep in mind, however, that some factors may increase the price of acrylic yarn, such as thickness, added sequins or tinsel, or blended fibers.

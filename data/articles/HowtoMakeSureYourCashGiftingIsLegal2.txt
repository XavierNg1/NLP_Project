 If you receive a cash gift, your requirements are only to file for taxes it if it is above the $14,000 per person limit. You will still have to report it so it falls under the “annual exclusion” for gifts.When you receive cash gifts, you have to file it under an “annual exclusion”. This “annual exclusion” states that the amount of money you received can be used immediately.
Even if you will not be using the full amount of the cash gift immediately, it can be filed as an immediate use. The IRS just wants to verify that your cash gift is not an investment or payment for goods or services, which are both taxable.
 For the most part, donors are required to pay taxes if they do not meet the "annual exclusion" requirements. However, you can arrange to pay the taxes instead.In many cases, the donors will pay the taxes of the gift. If they pay you more than $14,000 per person, then taxes will be due.
You can arrange to pay the taxes instead of them if you desire. If your parents are giving you money for a house down payment, you may want to pay the taxes on it rather than having them pay taxes on their gift to you. Be sure to talk to tax accountants first before making such arrangements.
 If you receive a cash gift from a relative, there can be no stipulations on that gift. Once it is gifted, it belongs to you permanently.In the case of cash gifts for house down payments, your family can set this up as a loan if they wish to have legal recourse in the future. You can usually get banks to set up loan paperwork between individuals for a fee.
Family members that want their money back or some form of payment after a cash gift have no legal recourse. In order to be considered a gift, the amount can have no requirements on its use.

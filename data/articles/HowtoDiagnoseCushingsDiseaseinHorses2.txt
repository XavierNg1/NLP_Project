 Horses with Cushing’s might experience one of several strange and counterintuitive weight-related scenarios. They might lose weight if they continue to eat the same amount of food they always have. Alternately, your horse might start eating significantly more than it used to, but fail to gain weight. Finally, a horse with Cushing’s might gain weight, but eat even less than it did before.Keep an eye out for changes in your horse’s weight and the way your horse eats in order to get a diagnosis before your horse gets worse.
 Laminitis (also known as founder) is the inflammation of the tissue within the hoof wall. The condition is very painful and will cause the horse to be unwilling to walk or move. Your horse might lie down and be reluctant to rise. When it does walk, it will do so extremely carefully and may place the heel of its hoof down first (rather than its toes) in an attempt to spare itself from pain., Your horse might be depressed and lethargic if it has Cushing’s disease. You might notice that it only wants to sit in one spot all day, and acts less playful than it used to. These behavioral changes might just be a sign of old age, but they could also indicate that your horse has Cushing’s., A consequence and related symptom of this high water consumption is that your horse will urinate frequently and in high volumes. Horses with Cushing’s disease drink and urinate in slightly different amounts, but if you notice your horse begin to drink anywhere from two to five times the amount of water it normally drinks, you should definitely suspect it has Cushing’s.Most horses drink about 20 to 30 liters (5 to 8 US gal) of water each day.
Horses with Cushing’s might drink up to 80 liters (21.1 US gal) each day.
Instead of letting your horse drink out of a trough, hang buckets of water in their stall. Keep track of how often you have to refill the buckets each day so that you can accurately measure how much they drink.

 Build some sort of fort. It doesn't have to be particularly elaborate, but it should either conceal you or offer defense from the opposing team. It should be sturdy and easy to defend.;
, Divide into two (or more) teams. If you can't decide who will be on which team, use Rock, Paper, Scissors to decide.
 Give the people on your team certain jobs. The person who has the best plans might be elected the commanding officer, while the person who is the best at sneaking around can be used as a scout or lookout.
 Water balloons and water guns make good weapons. Pine cones and sticks will also work, as well as Nerf guns, hula hoops, or just about anything imaginative. Be careful to choose a weapon which doesn't have the possibility of severely injuring other players. Keep the weapons distracting but safe.
 Put bandages, plaster, and candy in these to be used as "medicine". This will make the game more realistic

, The game ends when one side captures the other side's fort or one side surrenders.

 If you can't do a good and tucked back tuck on the trampoline, or better yet, on the ground, you should just close this and go look for how to do one.;
, If you haven't performed one of these, do a backdrop and kind of pull your feet over to land on your feet. When you do the backdrop, bend your knees a little so it's easier to pull them over.
 Do a back tuck, land, and convert it into a backdrop pull-over. Do that, but don't land after your back tuck so it will be like doing a complete back tuck to your back and then pulling your feet over. Work on this a lot before you think about a double back. make sure you find this skill easy before you think about a double back as well. Also it will help a LOT if you do your back tuck really high and quick so you are kinda just sitting in the air before you land on your back.
 After you can do this, pull your tuck really tight in and keep going without landing on your back. On your second back flip, keep your knees tucked as tightly as possible. If you do not, you WILL land on your neck. In fact, at first, don't even try to land on your feet at all. If you succeed at a double back and land on your knees or butt, it won't hurt nearly as bad as your back or neck. Have a professional spotter there at all times.

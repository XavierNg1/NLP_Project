 When you get dust, hair, or another small foreign body stuck in your eye, your body’s natural response is to blink. Blinking rapidly may help move the debris, and allow any tears that may form to clear it out. The more you blink and get yourself to tear up, the better chance you have of removing the particle.


To blink, rapidly open and close your eye.
Although you may feel silly, the tears will naturally wash out the debris.
If you cannot focus enough to get yourself to fake cry, then you can also try yawning to produce tears.;
, If you’re attempting to remove something stuck beneath your eyelid, close the affected eye and gently pinch the skin of your upper eyelid. Pull the upper eyelid down slightly over the lower one. Roll your affected eye around in its socket. With luck, this motion will loosen and dislodge something in your eye., It is often instinctual to rub your eye when something has gotten into it, but this can actually be quite dangerous. If you rub your eye, the trapped particle might be pushed beneath your eyelid or scratch your cornea, known as corneal abrasion.If this occurs, you could suffer permanent eye damage, along with a lot of pain. Therefore, do not apply pressure or rub your eyes when removing something from your eye.

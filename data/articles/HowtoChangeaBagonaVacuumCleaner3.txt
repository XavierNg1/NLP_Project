 Most handheld vacuums have a small, reusable bag or plastic chamber used to store any dirt and debris that has collected. Remove the plastic surrounding the chamber or bag to access the collected dirt and miscellaneous items.Because handheld vacuums are small, removing the tray or bag is usually a small enough task that it can be done over a kitchen trash.
 Dump the bag’s contents into the trash, making sure everything has left the bag or chamber. Small vacuums are far more prone to malfunction, so making sure both the bag (or chamber) and filter are clean is pivotal in getting the most out of your vacuum., Run the bag or bin under warm water, using your fingers to tease out any stubborn dirt or debris. Leaving dirt behind could affect the efficiency of your handheld vacuum, so make sure you are thorough in cleaning your device.

Some models allow you to place the bag and filter into the washer and dryer. Check your owner’s manual for more information.
 Always allow your bags and filters to dry before placing them bag into the chamber of your device. Placing a wet bag or filter into your handheld vacuum could result in an electrical short and subsequent electrocution.

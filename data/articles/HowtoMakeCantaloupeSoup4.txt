 Using a knife, remove the skin from the cantaloupe and dice the cantaloupe into cubes. Remove any seeds that the cantaloupe may have., Place the chopped cantaloupe in a blender and add in the vanilla yogurt. Blend on high speed for about two minutes until the two are properly combined., Pour the mango juice or chopped mango into the blended cantaloupe. Combine in the ginger and honey. Blend again on high speed for about a minute, until the soup is slightly creamy and resembles a bright orange color., Using a rubber spatula, scrape the cantaloupe soup out and place it in a large bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or aluminum foil., Place the bowl in the fridge to chill for about two to three hours. This helps the soup become cold and helps it firm slightly., Scoop the cantaloupe soup in a serving bowl. Garnish with mint leaves, if desired. Enjoy!

 Use a bit of make up and wear good clothes. Smile a lot. If you look good, people will be happy around you. Don't wear too much makeup. If you use a dress that is too long you might trip. Do your hair every day, even if it is just brushing it. Wear some jewelry. remember, you are not a fashion model, so don't act too much like one.;
, Help people out and smile at them. If you make an effort, people will like you. If people are mean to you, shake it off! Say "I don't care if I *insert something here* and walk away. It will make people respect you and make you look more powerful.
 You gotta know how to take on the dance floor! Practice makes perfect. Learn slow song dances and fast song dances. Take your phone and play some music on it and practice at home! Wear your dress so you know how it feels when you are dancing in it. If you don't, you probably wouldn't be used to it on the day of prom.
 Don't pull any ridiculous poses. Be you, and you is you. You matter! Everyone does. Don't try to act like someone else, people won't like you that much. They will think you are kind of silly.
 You want everyone to know you at the prom. Help with the food, music, or you could even put up decorations! The possibilities are endless.
 You want to be the one everyone loves- this includes guys. If you have a boyfriend, though, don't flirt.
 Don't turn into someone else or befriend and anyone in this process. Stay you, the one who people want to vote for.
 You have to be respected; the ones who slack are just called losers.
 Hand out fliers, hats and badges, hang out with everyone, be nice, give out cupcakes. Or just stick to a simple "Hi! You are a nice person! Would you mind to vote for me?"

 Have you noticed a heaviness in your body which gets triggered by some event that is peculiar and painful to you? A dark heavy cloud or entity of emotions that takes you over and makes your thinking extremely negative.That's pain body. Pain body is one of the powerful things that ego can identify with.Emotions are a reflection of mind in body, so when pain-body gets activated, it becomes a 'loop' system. This means ego enhances the pain body through negative thoughts and pain body enhances negative thinking through negative emotions. Every time you recognize this dysfunctional alliance between ego and pain-body, it loses energy and looks for another opportunity to come out, when you are less conscious.Just be aware of it and don't resist it. Don't let the 'pain body' come up and turn into thinking."If you don't mind being unhappy then what would happen to the unhappiness?" Eckhart Tolle. Read How to Stay Rooted in Being for more depth.

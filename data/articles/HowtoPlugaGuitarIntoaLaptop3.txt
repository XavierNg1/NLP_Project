 For the best results, bypass the analog connection entirely and connect your guitar digitally to your computer. You can connect your guitar digitally to your computer through a pre-amp with a USB or Firewire outport. Before you purchase a pre-amp with one of these out ports, check to see if the guitar accessories you already own will work. These accessories may include amp-modelers, pedals, drum machines, and direct boxes., Place your standard guitar cable into your guitar. Plug the opposite end of the guitar cable into the pre-amp’s input port. Insert a USB, Firewire, or Optical cable into your pre-amp’s USB or Firewire out port. Plug the other end of this cable into your laptop’s USB or Firewire in port., When your guitar is properly connected, you will be able to assess the strength and quality of your guitar’s signal. Listen to the instrument through your computer’s speakers, a set of external speakers, or a pair of headphones. If you’re using external speakers or headphones, insert their respective cables into your laptop’s audio-out port. Play a few chords on your guitar to test the signal.This method will produce the crispest and clearest recordings.You may need to download and/or open recording software in order to hear your instrument.
If your guitar’s sound is not coming through, make sure the instrument’s volume is turned all the way up. Open your computer’s sound settings and double check that your volume is not muted and that the correct port or device is selected (audio-in, audio-out, headphone, microphone, etc.). For specific instructions, consult your computer or device’s manual.

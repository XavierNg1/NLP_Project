 Figure out what instrumentation you want; guitar, piano, bass, percussion? And how, roughly speaking, do you want to mix it? Write it down.;
, This will be the foundation of your song. Piano or guitar are usually good choices.
 This is usually the best way to get the best audio quality. You will have to do some trial and error.
 (See part 2 for importing your audio files). Make sure as you continue to build your song that you are listening to (on headphones) what you've already recorded so that the finished product is IN TIME or SYNC with itself. You do not want the percussion playing faster than the guitar, for instance.
 Your camera will come with its own software for importing videos. Once the files are on your computer, import them into Adobe Premiere Elements.
 This file should be named as name.prel (similar to Word documents, which are name.docx).
 Timeline, not Sceneline, is the only viewing option you should use for these instructions.
 It isn't needed. Keep the audio alone.
 There is a lot of space in Adobe Premiere Elements, so utilize the lines listed as "soundtrack," "narration," "audio 1," etc.
 Adobe Premiere Elements allows you to play with volume and equalizer. If you make adjustments on a file while it is not in playback, the adjustment will be uniform throughout the entire file. If you make adjustments on a file while it is in playback, the adjustments will be saved in real time. Be careful.
 Did you cough on one of the files? Screw up a guitar lick? No worries! Just cut out the undesired audio clip or mute it. Do this after initial mixing so your volume and EQ levels are consistent. Otherwise, if you split your file first, you will need to make the adjustments twice, for each half.
 Adobe Premiere Elements offers several audio file formats for rendering, including MP3 and AAC.
 Open the song file in Windows Media Player or iTunes (or another similar program) and burn the song to disc.

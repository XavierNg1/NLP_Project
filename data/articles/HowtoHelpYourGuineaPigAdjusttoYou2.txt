 Increase as they get more used to you. After a little while, put your guinea pig in a guinea pig-proof space, where he/she can run harmlessly.
 To soothe your guinea pig, I recommend singing or speaking in a soft voice. They will eventually grow to trust you, and you will be able to do more with them.
 Guinea pigs are fragile creatures, and they do not forget easily. Eventually, they will trust you and be easier to train and love.

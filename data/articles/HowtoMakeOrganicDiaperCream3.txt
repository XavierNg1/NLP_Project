Shea butter: Shea butter contains vitamins for the skin and can help create a creamy, water resistant base for your diaper cream.Fermented Cod Liver Oil: This ingredient provides fat-soluble vitamins to help your baby’s skin and immune system, but your baby’s skin will only absorb what is needed.

¼ cup Shea butter
¼ cup coconut oil
1 tablespoon beeswax pellets
2 tablespoons fermented cod liver oil
2 tablespoons zinc oxide powder
1 tablespoon bentonite clay

, To begin making the cream, melt the shea butter, coconut oil, and beeswax in the microwave or in a double boiler on low heat. Once it is melted or very close to melted, add the fermented cod liver oil and continue to heat gently until everything is melted and combined.


Add the zinc oxide and bentonite clay and stir until combined. Freeze for 5 to 10 minutes to cool and solidify.

 To begin your basic Dot Plot, draw a line long enough to hold all of your data.;
, Labeling your plot will need to be done on the bottom, under the line you drew. Choosing whether to use Numbers or Words will depend on what your data consists of.


Numbers should be used when your problem looks like this: "How long does it take you to eat breakfast?"
Words should be used when your problem looks like this: "We asked Jack, Anna, and Flickety to guess how many wikiHowian friends they have. Anna said 100, Jack said 101, and Flickety said 102. So instead of numbers at the bottom, you'd use the names of the wikiHow Admins listed in the problem instead.
 After labeling and or numbering your Dot Plot, you now must place the data onto the table.


For Example: If your dot plot problem says something such as this: "Krystle was asked how many cookies she gave Adelaide from 5pm to 10pm. She said she gave her 2 cookies at 5pm, 4 cookies at 6pm, 1 cookie at 7pm, 6 cookies' at 8pm, 5 cookies at 9pm, and 1 cookie at 10pm." then your Dot Plot should look just like the one in the picture above.
 Referring to the image within the step above, each dot was placed on the corresponding time of day representing 1 cookie per dot:



Adelaide received 6 cookies at 8pm, therefore eight dots have been placed onto the Dot Plot above "8pm".
In this example, 1 dot is equivalent to 1 cookie. As for most dot plots, the dots will more than likely be equal to 1 of something (x = 1).

 Instead of hanging just one streamer, you can add color to the space by hanging two streamers at the same time. Select two different colored streamers., Set the one streamer on top of the other so their ends meet and tape the ends together. Roll out each streamer to the desired length and cut.
 Staple each end of the layered streamers. If you don't have a stapler, you can tape the two streamers together., Attach one end of the layered streamers to a surface. As you walk to the other attachment point, rotate the streamers so they twist. Attach the other end to a surface.

In order to see both colors, you must twist the streamers.

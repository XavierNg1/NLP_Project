 Smaller plants can be measured with a ruler, while taller plants may require a measuring tape, yard stick, or meter stick. Make sure that the ruler begins at zero on the bottom.

If you are measuring a plant in a pot, the ruler should begin at ground level.;
, You will want to measure the plant from its base to its highest point. Write this down in a chart with both the date and the height recorded. Repeat every two to three days., You can see the average daily growth rate by taking the change in size and dividing it by the amount of time it has been growing.

The equation for the growth rate formula is (S2âˆ’S1)T{\displaystyle {\frac {(S2-S1)}{T}}}where S1=first measurement, S2=second measurement, and T equals the number of days between each.This is an extremely general figure. Plant growth rate is extremely fluid and can be subject to major variations day by day. Currently, there is no way to accurately predict exact daily growth rate without the use of sophisticated laboratory equipment.

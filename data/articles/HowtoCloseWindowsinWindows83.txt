 This will work for windows in desktop mode as well as for Windows 8 apps. This is a useful shortcut for frozen programs that aren't responding to clicking the "X".
 This will open a list of all your running processes, and is the easiest way to close any non responsive programs. By default, the Task Manager will open displaying the Processes tab, which shows all of your open apps and running processes.


Select the app or process that you want to force close. Frozen apps will say "Not responding".
Click the End task button. Task Manager will attempt to force the program to close.
If you are still having difficulty closing a program, click here.

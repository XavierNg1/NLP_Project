 Business letter sign-offs should be formal, familiar, and appropriate for the situation. Unless you are in a field that values creativity and originality above traditional business decorum, it's best to play it on the safe side when your letter is formal in nature. Always follow the sign-off with your signature. Consider the following options:


Sincerely,
Best wishes,
Warm wishes,
Thank you,
Respectfully yours,

, For letters that are more casual in nature, the closing helps maintain goodwill and keep correspondence flowing smoothly. If you're writing to an acquaintance, casual friend or a classmate, you might close with a friendly goodbye, like these:


Cheers,
Take care,
Til next time,
Later,
Peace,
Warmly,

, If you're writing to a close friend or family member, consider a more personal closing, like:


XO,
Yours,
Hugs,
Kisses,
Til soon,
Write soon,
Love,

, If you're writing to a lover, ending words can be even more intimate. A genuine, personable closing helps the letter sound like it came from you, not a store-bought greeting card. The right phrase might even improve your relationship. Follow the sign-off with your initials or signature. Consider these:


Love always,
Yours forever,
Affectionately yours,
Longing to see you,
Patiently yours,
Your darling,

 Through pictures we know that Ryan uses liquid eyeliner for the lightning-bolt design. However, this was obvious seeing as it is a ‘’fiddly design, and a pencil would be much too thick. Also, liquid tends to give a more solid color.;
,, All I can really tell you is: for tricky, delicate designs, use liquid eyeliner (ones with a longer brush are better for flexibility etc. ). For the eyeshadow parts, you can use a little brush or a cotton-wool ball, anything that spreads evenly with ease. For the mask-esque designs, you can use liquid or pencil, it doesn’t really matter. For the mask part, outline the shape you’d like with tape, and fill in with eyeshadow. Then, tear off the tape, and you will have a nice, even line.
 Is it eyeliner? Liquid or pencil? Is it eyeshadow? Do I have a color similar to that? What can I use to spread it evenly? These are all questions you should ask yourself.
 They include stripes, bats flying over a red background, birds in a sunset, and spikes. Come up with your own designs, too!

 Many shoes are only squeaky when wet. Sometimes, this is just the sound made by rubber soles on linoleum, hard wood, or other slick floor materials. Other shoes swell up or develop structural issues when wet that cause squeaking, and these can be treated using the other methods on this page. Either way, the drying methods in this section will teach you to dry your shoes quickly and effectively, without causing damage to the shoe.
 If you shoes have removable insoles, take them out and dry them separately to speed up the process.
 Bunch up the dry paper and fit it into the shoe. Press the first piece all the way into the toe for maximum absorbency.
 A "shoe tree" is a branched object inserted into the shoe instead of newspaper, meant to maintain the shoe's shape while it dries. A shoe tree made of cedar is especially effective, since the wood will wick moisture out of the shoe., Rest the shoe on its side or prop it against a wall so the sole of the shoe is exposed to the air while drying. Dry in a warm room, but not next to any heat sources.

, You want to choose a document that already contains vector images that you want to rasterize.
 If you want to rasterize more than 1 object, press the "Control" button as you click on objects that you want to select.
 The latter is called "Raster Effects." You will use 2 separate methods to accomplish these options.

Select the Color Mode that you would like to use. Choose RGB or CMYK. This may depend upon your printer or display preference. This specifies which wavelengths of light will be reflected. CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) inks are very common in digital art and printing, where RGB (Red, Green, Blue) are commonly used in files received from scanners.
If you are printing a document and you do not know what Color Mode your printer prefers, it is best to check with them before rasterizing your images or document.
Choose the resolution. The resolution determines the number of pixels per inch. Choose "Use Document Raster Effects Resolution to use global resolution settings."
Choose your background. Select a white background if you would like Illustrator to fill in the background on the object. Choose "transparent" if you do not want the vector image to be on a background.
Deselect the "Anti-Alias" option. This will keep the crisp lines of your object instead of blurring them when they are rasterized.

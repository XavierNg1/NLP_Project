 Staring makes it obvious that you're checking a girl out. Instead of keeping your eyes on her, pretend like you're looking around the room naturally. As you're moving your head and eyes around, sneak looks at the girl that you want to check out.For instance if you notice her at a sporting event, you can pretend to watch the game but steal looks at her instead.
If you share the same lunch period you can act like you're looking around the cafeteria or looking at your friends, when you're really checking her out.;
, Sunglasses will hide where you're looking and enable you to check out a girl without her thinking that you're looking directly at her. If you want to use sunglasses, make sure that you get ones with dark or reflective lenses so that she can't see your eyes., If you're far enough away from the girl, she won't be able to see your eyes or where you're looking. If you don't want her to notice you, wait for her to walk at least five feet (1.5 m) away before turning to look at her.

Don't follow the girl around, just check her out when she's around you.
Don't do this repeatedly or she and her friends may think you're creepy.
 Instead of looking directly in the girl's direction, you can use your side vision, or your peripheral vision, to check them out. You can practice this in your room by keeping your head straight and trying to look at things on the side of you. Instead of turning your head or facing the girl, look at her from the side., There's no reason why you need to stare at someone. Instead, just take a quick glance, check her out, and then look at something else. If you check her out for too long, it could come off as creepy and isn't a habit you want to get into.

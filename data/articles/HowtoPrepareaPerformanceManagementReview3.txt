 Encourage the employee to provide feedback throughout the process. Be open to explanations given by the employee. It should not become a practice to change a written performance mark, but do so if the employee presents reasons that you find compelling.
 These goals and responsibilities should be discussed through an interactive conversation with the employee. Be sure that the employee understands and commits to the new goals and responsibilities.
 Take this opportunity to thank the employee for her good performance. Mention performance rewards that may be forthcoming, if applicable.
 Tell the employee what formal or informal steps need to be taken to improve performance. Make sure that the employee understands what is required, and understands that the plans are not a punishment for poor performance, but a chance to improve skills and abilities.
 Present the employee with pay adjustments or other considerations, if applicable. Have the employee sign the review.

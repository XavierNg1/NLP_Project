 Vinegar is a dilute solution of acetic acid. The solution is primarily water, with anywhere between 3% and 7% acetic acid. The acetic acid is a necessary ingredient in forming sodium acetate. Pour 500 mL (roughly 2 cups) of vinegar into a pan.Always wear safety goggles and gloves when handling acids and bases like vinegar and baking soda.;
, Baking soda is the common name for sodium bicarbonate. This ingredient will provide the sodium needed to form sodium acetate. Slowly sprinkle about 35 grams (7 teaspoons) of baking soda for each 500 mL (2 cups) of vinegar., As you sprinkle the baking soda into the vinegar, you will see the solution start to bubble. This is due to the formation of carbon dioxide gas during the reaction. Use a stir rod or a spoon to keep the reaction stirred, and prevent it from bubbling out of the container.The reaction of vinegar with baking soda is as follows: NaHCO3 + CH3COOH ---> CH3COONa + CO2 + H2O

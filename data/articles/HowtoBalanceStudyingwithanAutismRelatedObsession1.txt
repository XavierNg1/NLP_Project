 Special interests help you develop skills, achieve mastery in a field, and balance your mental health. They may even turn into an excellent career. You should never feel guilty for taking time to do the things you love.


To maintain balance, set aside plenty of time for your passions each day.;
, It's difficult for you to concentrate if you've been doing math problems for two hours straight. Schedule breaks into your study sessions (whether they're 5 minutes or half an hour) so that you can take time to rebalance your brain.
 Exhaustion, lack of focus, and broken concentration are your body's signals that it needs a break. Take five minutes to get up, get yourself a drink, or just walk around the room a little.
 These will hurt your physical and mental health, as well as harming your performance. You may find yourself making simple mistakes out of sheer exhaustion. Make sure that you take time to breathe, and get at least seven hours of sleep before a big test.
 Switch between taking notes, writing flashcards, illustrating your notes, and getting friends to quiz you. Using a variety of strategies will help to keep you from getting bored.

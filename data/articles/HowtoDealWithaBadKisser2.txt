 It’s important not to stop at “they’re a bad kisser” if you’re hoping to solve the problem. Think of specific things your partner is doing that might bother you, so you can fix them. There are a few things that can go wrong in a kiss.Too much teeth. Teeth banging together can definitely be a turn-off.
Too much saliva. The last thing you want to say about a kiss is it’s slobbery.
Bad breath.
Too much or too little tongue.
 You might need to do this because you’re just not ready for that kind of contact, or your partner’s hands are less than gentle. Simply grab the hand(s) and redirect them towards a spot you’re comfortable with.For instance, you can take your partner’s hand to your waist, or maybe up to your face.


After redirecting their hands you can let them know you enjoy being caressed there.
 Bumping teeth usually happens because the two of you are very eager.There’s nothing wrong with that! But unless bumping teeth is a turn on for you, you might want to slow down just a tad. If your partner doesn’t take the hint, you can take your partner’s head in your hands and gently tell them to slow down.
 Too much saliva can happen when there’s too much tongue action and not enough lip movement. Try focusing on kissing their lips gently, toning things down a bit.If they follow your lead, you should be dealing with much less slobber.


If they don’t follow your lead, try pulling away a bit. Usually that’s enough of a sign to slow things down.
 Keep in mind that the amount of tongue that is acceptable in a kiss is very subjective. If your partner’s tongue isn’t doing too much, you’ll have to take the lead. Make sure your tongue has the first move; they’ll follow along.If the problem is their tongue going too wild, you have a couple of options. The first is to pull away noticeably.
They’ll either understand and slow down, or follow and keep their intensity.
If they do the latter, you can stop, and gently tell them to slow down.

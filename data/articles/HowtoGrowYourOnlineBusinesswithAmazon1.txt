 One of the easiest ways to grow your business using Amazon is to create an Amazon account as an individual seller. Sign up for an account on Amazon.com and start selling your products through your Amazon account. This is ideal if you have a small number of items to sell as a merchant and are looking to build your business slowly.As an individual seller, you will need to pay $0.99 per item that sells on Amazon.
Keep in mind that as an individual seller you will actually be competing with Amazon for customers. You also may not get the sales proceeds right away through Amazon.com as an individual seller.;
, This option is available through Amazon.com for a monthly fee and is ideal for online businesses with a fairly large amount of product. As a “pro merchant” on Amazon, you will also need to pay Amazon a referral fee that is a percentage or a fixed amount of each sale. But you will get access to selling and administrative tools on the site that can help grow your business.The one potential downside of the “pro merchant” option on Amazon is that if you have a large inventory as an online business, you will need to devote some time to the upkeep and maintenance of your account on Amazon, as you will have to do it yourself.
 This is a good option if you are looking for an ecommerce platform to help you get a webstore off the ground. Having an online store through Amazon can make it easy for you to set up the store and market your products to Amazon customers.To set up the online store through Amazon, you will need to pay a $24 monthly fee and two percent of your sales.
If you are already a “pro merchant” on Amazon, you can use the webstore services for free.

 Completing the square is another way to find the vertex of a quadratic equation. For this method, when you get to the end, you'll be able to find your x and y coordinates right away, instead of plugging the x coordinate back in to the original equation. Let's say you're working with the following quadratic equation: x2 + 4x + 1 = 0., In this case, the coefficient of the x 2 term is 1, so you can skip this step. Dividing each term by 1 would not change anything. Dividing each term by 0, however, will change everything.
 The constant term is the term without a coefficient. In this case, it is "1." Move 1 to the other side of the equation by subtracting 1 from both sides. Here's how you do it:x2 + 4x + 1 = 0
x2 + 4x + 1 -1 = 0 - 1
x2 + 4x = - 1

, To do this, simply find (b/2)2 and add the result to both sides of the equation. Plug in "4" for b, since "4x" is the b-term of this equation.


(4/2)2 = 22 = 4. Now, add 4 to both sides of the equation to get the following:

x2 + 4x + 4 = -1 + 4
x2 + 4x + 4 = 3



, Now you will see that x2 + 4x + 4 is a perfect square. It can be rewritten as (x + 2)2 = 3

, You can find your x coordinate by simply setting (x + 2) 2 equal to zero. So when (x + 2) 2 = 0, what would x have to be? The variable x would have to be -2 to balance out the +2, so your x coordinate is -2. Your y-coordinate is simply the constant term on the other side of the equation. So, y = 3. You can also do a shortcut and just take the opposite sign of the number in parentheses to get the x-coordinate. So the vertex of the equation x 2 + 4x + 1 = (-2, 3)

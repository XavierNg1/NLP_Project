 Lemon is a classic natural lightening agent for hair. While it’s natural, it can still dry out your hair so it’s important to dilute it. Combine 1 part lemon juice with 1 part water to reduce its acidity, and pour it into a spray bottle.For the best results, use fresh, organic lemon juice. Bottled juice can work, but make sure that it’s 100% real juice.
If your hair is extremely dry, you can substitute coconut oil or conditioner for the water to minimize damage.
You can also dilute the lemon juice with more water if you’re concerned about damage.;
, After you’ve mixed up the lemon juice solution, spritz it all over your hair. You can also use your fingers to gently work it into your hair to ensure that the locks are evenly coated., Once your hair is coated with the lemon juice solution, you’ll want to sit out in the sun. The heat will help the citric acid in the lemons lighten your hair, so remain outside until your hair is almost completely air dried.To avoid damage, don’t sit outside in the sun for more than an hour and a half.
If you’re concerned about damaging your hair, you can also apply the lemon mixture to your hair at the start of your shower as a rinse. When your shower is over, wash it from your hair and follow up with conditioner. Repeat the process regularly to gradually lighten your hair.
 When your hair has mostly dried, take a shower and rinse the lemon juice out with your usual shampoo. Condition the hair to ensure that it’s properly hydrated, and allow it to air dry.For more intense lightening, you can leave the lemon juice solution in your hair overnight and wash it out in the morning.

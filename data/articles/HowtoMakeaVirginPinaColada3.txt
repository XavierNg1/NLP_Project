 Keep pulsing until it's completely smooth and creamy.
 You can use strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, or a combination of all three! Blend the berries with the creamy base to create a colorful drink.
 Use clear glasses so you can appreciate the pretty color of your fruity pi√±a colada.
 Enjoy your drink with a straw.

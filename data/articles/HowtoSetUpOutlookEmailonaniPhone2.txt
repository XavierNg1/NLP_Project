 Open iTunes on your iPhone and enter “Microsoft Outlook” on the search bar at the top of screen. Tap “Enter” on your keyboard, and the Outlook for iOS application page should turn up.


Tap the “Install” button you see on the application page, and Outlook will be automatically downloaded and installed on your device.
Outlook iOS is only available for iPhones and other Apple mobile devices that have iOS version 8 or above, but it’s free to download.
 Tap “Settings” (app with a gear icon) from the home screen of your iPhone to open the device’s settings menu.
 Scroll down the Settings menu and tap the “Mail, Contacts, and Calendar” item from the list of available options you see on the screen.
 Inside, tap “Add Account” and select “Outlook” from the available types of accounts you could use to start setting up your Outlook email on your iPhone.
 Type in your full Outlook email address (in example: “johndoe@outlook.com”), the password of your account, and press “Next.” Your iPhone will then try to access your Outlook email and synchronize its data.
 It will take only a few seconds to sync your Outlook email with your iPhone. Once the sync is complete, tap the “Save” button that will appear on the screen to save everything you’ve done. Your Outlook email is now set up with your iPhone.
 Tap its app icon (white envelope with a letter “o” on it) from the home screen of your iPhone to launch the application. Once you open the app, you should be able to see all the email messages that are currently saved on your Outlook account, ready for you to access.

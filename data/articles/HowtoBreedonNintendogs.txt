 The color doesn't matter.


Have the female dog wear a rose and the male dog a lucky collar.;
, You can do this by one of the following:


Letting them play with toys they both like (football, etc.);
Letting them cuddle.
,, When you brush her, you should see kicking.


Do not bathe the dogs. Only brush to check for kicking.
Do not take walks or enter into competitions.
 You will not be warned when the female is pregnant or has had the puppy. In a week you should have a puppy.


If you're really lucky, you may only need to wait for 4 days before the female dog gives birth.

 Since its neck vertebrae and other joints are stiff or fused, a cat suffering from vitamin A toxicity has trouble moving. It might struggle walking, have trouble reaching its food and water, or become aggressive when touched or moved.It might also sit in a strange, kangaroo-like pose with its forelimbs outstretched.;
, Reduced self-grooming often results when a cat suffers from mobility issues. Look for signs such as an unkempt or messy coat, matting, and lots of loose, dead hair in the coat. Its feet might also be stained from the litter box, and it might constantly have food on its muzzle., While decreased mobility is the most noticeable symptom of vitamin A toxicity, it can also lead to weight loss and poor appetite. Too much vitamin A causes metabolic changes that cause weight loss, and your cat might have difficulty accessing its food bowl.In kittens, vitamin A toxicity can prevent normal growth and weight gain.
 In addition to weight loss or problems gaining weight, vitamin A toxicity in kittens also causes dental issues. Look for loose teeth, abnormally formed teeth, and gingivitis.Dental issues don’t occur when adult cats eat too much vitamin A.
 Symptoms associated with vitamin A toxicity can also occur in a number of other disorders, so only a vet can make an accurate diagnosis. The vet will ask you about your cat’s diet, the types of treats you offer, and if it has any related symptoms. They’ll administer an x-ray or ultrasound to check for abnormal bone growth and joint fusion.The vet will also order blood work to test its vitamin A levels and rule out other conditions. In addition, vitamin A toxicity can lead to kidney and liver issues, so the vet will likely check these organs’ functions.

 Peel and slice the banana. Rinse the strawberries, cut off the stems, and cut them into quarters or halves (to make blending easier). Rinse the blueberries.


For a thicker smoothie, you can use frozen bananas instead.
 If you don't have a blender, use a food processor fitted with metal blades instead.
 If you'd like your smoothie to be sweet, add in the honey. If you don't have any agave nectar, you can use another sweetener, such as honey, stevia, or sugar.
 If you are using frozen bananas, then you can use less ice or skip it entirely.
 From time to time, you may have to pause the blender, open it up, and push the ingredients down the sides with a spatula. Keep pulsing and mixing until there are no lumps or chunks left.
 You can serve it as it is, or garnish it with a few banana slices, a sliced strawberry, or a few blueberries.

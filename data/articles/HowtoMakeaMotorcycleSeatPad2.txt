Switch off the electric knife and plunge it into the cut you made to the back of the outline. This is the extended line that touches where the seat's hump slopes upward.
Turn the knife sideways so the serrated blade is horizontal and facing forward.
Power on the electric knife and cut while gliding the knife forward until you reach the front line. This will excise the 2 sections of foam out of the seat.

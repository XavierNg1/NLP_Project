 With the napkin flat, face-down in front of you, fold it in half diagonally and shift the open edge so that it is away from you (triangle points up)., Fold both the right and left corners, one at a time, so that they meet at the center corner. Your napkin should now look like a square or diamond.
 Make sure to keep the orientation of the napkin the same, with the open points at the top.
 Fold the top point down to meet the bottom point.
 Fold the napkin along the center seam. This will form the final pyramid. This is often placed on a dinner plate and is a common restaurant napkin style.

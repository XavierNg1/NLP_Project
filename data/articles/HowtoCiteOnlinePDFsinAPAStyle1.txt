 Place this at the end of the sentence you want to cite. If the article doesn’t have an author, use a shortened form of the title. For example:


“Water levels are at an all-time low in North Texas (Jean.”;
, For example:


“Water levels are at an all-time low in North Texas (Jean, 2006.”

, Notice that there is a comma between each piece of information. Close the parenthesis after the page number. For example:


“Water levels are at an all-time low in North Texas (Jean, 2006, 36).”

 These decorations give the impression that you're into accessories and jewelry.;
, You don't want a bunch of junk thrown at the bottom of your locker, do you? Victoria's Secret PINK stores aren't messy, so your locker shouldn't be.
 If you don't have a PINK hoodie, just hang up a pink jacket. This shows you really do love PINK products, not just the style.
 If you can't afford PINK lotions/your parents won't let you buy them, skip this step. As stated above, it will show you're in love with pink and PINK.
 PINK is glamorous, and nothing says glamour like a mirror! I would suggest a vanity; one that looks like a dry erase board then opens to a mirror.
 Keep pictures of your stuffed animals too. This shows you're fun, slightly goofy, and can laugh at yourself (especially if you put up a pic of you making a hilarious face).
 Unless you already have a backpack/bag you really want to keep using. Or, just skip a backpack altogether and just bring a purse with your pencils and keep the rest in your locker.
 Put PINK quotes on them like "LOVE PINK" or "Study Less Party More" or "VIVA PINK" you get a lot more quotes off their hoodies at www.victoriassecret.com. Tape them in your locker and on your binders. Remember: glitter is your best friend!

, Buy pink folders, notebooks, and pens. Also, buy a pink binder. If it is too pink for you, just buy some red, like 2 pink folders, 1 red folder, 2 red notebooks, 1 pink notebook, 1 pink pen, 1 red pen, and 1 purple pen. Decorate your pencils with heart stickers.
 then, sprinkle the top with silver, black, gold, or pink glitter. Wait for it to dry then glue a magnet on the back. Tah-dah!

 This is the easiest newspaper hat design of all. , You can either fold the paper or not. If you fold there will be a crease in your hat and won’t have that perfect conical shape.
 A single piece of tape at the edge of the cone will suffice, but you can choose to take the entire part where the two edges meet.
 After taping the edges together, you’ll have a triangle piece left over. Cut it off.



Try adding tassels, string, or lace at the top of the hat to give it a truly princess feel. If you'd rather turn it into a witch or wizard hat just cut a piece of cardboard into a circle. Cut a smaller circle out of the bottom and slide over the cone hat. Cut to size. Or if you want to build a birthday cone hat, add cotton balls to the top. Color in the sides with bright colors .Make a trim out of construction paper. Cut a long strip that can reach around the base of the hat. Make small cuts all along the side to add texture. Then paste to the base.

 Getting used to being Internet-free means being resourceful. You’ll want to make sure that you have maps to help find your way to your vacation spot and then around the vacation spot once you’re there. If you prefer something smaller than a paper map, you can also check out an offline GPS app that will work for you without needing Internet access.Print maps ahead of time. If you’re printing them from the Internet, you can often print both long views and close ups to help you avoid getting lost.
Buy paper maps. They can come in handy if you need to detour while you’re traveling if roads are closed or traffic is bad.
Many cities and states provide maps for tourist on request. Request them for areas you'll be visiting. Your hotel or resort may also have helpful paper maps on-hand as well.;
, If you plan on splitting up, don't lose touch. With a little preparation, you can stay connected for emergencies, changes in your plan, or just to share something great you saw.

Buy walkie-talkies. Be warned: while some might say that they provide service up to thirty miles, that might only be in ideal conditions. They aren’t recommended for an emergency.
Use offline chat apps.This option is handy if you travel with teens that wander off on their own.
Pick specific meeting times and places. Make sure the entire party is aware of where and when, and that they understand that meeting up is mandatory.
 Even on vacation, emails pile up from work, friends, and family. Don’t let yourself focus on what you’re missing.

Set up an away message that includes your return date and an alternate contact.
Let the emails stack up. You can deal with them later.
Send letters and postcards. Instant communication lets us get lazy and sloppy. Brighten the day of a friend or family member with some good old-fashioned snail mail.
If you must, give in. Don’t let your Internet break do more harm than good.

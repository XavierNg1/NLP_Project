 This recipe calls for plain rice that has already been cooked. To get this, just follow the recipe above, ignoring the vegetables and curry. In other words:


Add two cups of rice and four cups of water to a pot. Bring to a boil.
Cook until the surface of the rice appears dry and steam holes form. Reduce the heat to low.
Cover the pan and let simmer for 15 minutes.
Remove from heat, uncover, and let sit for five minutes before serving.
 Add the oil to a large, sturdy nonstick pan. Warm over medium-high heat for several minutes until shimmering.
 Crack an egg into a small bowl and beat with a fork until the yolk and white are combined. Pour the beaten egg into the hot pan. Swirl the pan to prevent sticking. When the egg solidifies, transfer it to a separate plate and set aside.
 Add the scallions and seasoning together to the pan and stir to combine. You can add an extra dash of oil here to prevent sticking if desired. Season with black pepper to taste. Cook until softened (about five minutes).


If you don't have scallions, substitute a white or yellow onion.
 Stir to mix with the ingredients in the pan. Spread in a single layer and let cook for about three minutes, stirring once.
 Transfer the egg back into the pan. Stir to break up the egg and combine it with the other ingredients. Season with salt to taste.
 Stirring in a small amount of sesame oil in the last minute of cooking gives the rice more of a "fried" quality. Add no more than a teaspoon or two over the rice and stir to combine. Let cook for 30 seconds to a minute and remove from heat. Spoon onto serving plates. Serve hot.

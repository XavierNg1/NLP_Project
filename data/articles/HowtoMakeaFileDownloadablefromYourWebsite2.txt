 If you use WordPress to manage and publish your website, you can use the built-in tools to add a download link to any of your pages. Log into your WordPress dashboard using the admin account.
 You can put the link in the middle of an existing paragraph or create a new line for it.
 You'll find this above the posting tools at the top of the page.
 You can upload a variety of different files, but WordPress may limit the size based on your account type.It may take a little while to upload files, as most connections are slower uploading than downloading.
 You can enter a description underneath the file in the Add Media window. This will be the text that displays as the download link.
 This will insert the download link at the location of your cursor. Note that this will link to an attachment page and not the actual file. This is a limitation of the WordPress software.

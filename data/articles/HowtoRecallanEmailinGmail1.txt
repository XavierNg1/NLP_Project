 You can enable a feature called "Undo Send" which will allow you to delay messages for a few seconds, giving you a chance to recall it if you'd like. You'll need to be signed into the Gmail website to enable it.;
, You'll find this button in the upper-right corner.
 You'll find this about halfway down the page.


This feature used to be a part of Gmail Labs, but has since been integrated into the general Gmail settings.
 Use the drop-down menu underneath the checkbox to select between 5, 10, 20, and 30 seconds. This is how long your messages will wait before they are sent.
 This will apply your new Undo Send feature settings.
 Once you've enabled the Undo Send feature, you can test it out by sending a message.
 You'll see this pop-up at the top of your Gmail screen. The "Undo" link will be available for as long as you set the delay.


These settings will apply to Inbox by Gmail as well. When you send a message in Inbox, you'll see the Undo button appear in the lower-left corner of the page after sending.

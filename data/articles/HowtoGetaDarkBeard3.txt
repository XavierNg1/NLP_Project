 If you are unable to grow a beard, or you can only grow a very patchy beard, you may want to consider a facial hair transplant. In this procedure, hair will be removed from either the back or side of your head and then transplanted to your face. This is an expensive procedure that costs around $7,000 (USD) and takes two to five hours to complete.After about two weeks the transplanted hair will fall out and then regrow three months later.
 You can also darken your hair with a natural remedy, such as black walnuts. Take 7-8 dark walnuts, crush them and then mix them with 7-8 cups of water. Cook the walnuts in water for about an hour and a half. Then let the mixture cool before straining the walnuts. Dip your beard into the walnuts and let the hair sit for anywhere from 5-20 minutes depending on the color you want to achieve.Walnuts can also dye your skin and clothes, so be careful when working with this mixture. Wear gloves and old clothing that you don't mind staining.
 In order to darken your beard with cocoa paste, you will need to combine cocoa powder and water until you get a thick paste. Apply the paste to your beard and let sit for 15 minutes.The longer you leave the powder on your hair, the darker your hair will be. Once you are finished, rinse your hair in water., Using a dark eye shadow or eye liner, you can pencil in patchy sections of your beard to make it look fuller. This will help to cover up any patches that may be present, giving you the look of a darker and fuller beard.

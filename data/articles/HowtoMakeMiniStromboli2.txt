 Pour 2 tablespoons of the olive oil into a skillet and heat it over medium. Dice up 3/4 cup (130 g) of red pepper, 3/4 cup (130 g) of green pepper, and 3/4 cup (115 g) of onion. Add this to the skillet along with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and saute the vegetables for 10 to 15 minutes.Stir the vegetables frequently to prevent them from sticking to the skillet. The vegetables will become soft once they're finished sauteeing.
 Turn the oven on to 375 degrees F (190 C). Transfer the sauteed vegetables to a large mixing bowl and stir in 1/4 cup (56 g) of the marinara sauce. Add 24 cooked mini-meatballs or pepperoni slices and stir the mixture well.You could use any meat instead of the mini-meatballs. For example, you could use cooked ground beef, chorizo, or Italian sausage.
 Lay a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet and set one pound (467 g) of refrigerated pizza dough on it. Divide the dough into 8 pieces and roll each one into an oval shape about 5-inches (12 cm) in size.You can use homemade or purchased pizza dough.
 Divide 1 1/2 cups (170 g) of shredded mozzarella among each of the ovals. Try to put the cheese in the center. Spread a little of the filling mixture onto the center of each oval as well.You can use a cookie scoop to easily portion the filling among the mini-Stromboli.
 To seal a mini-Stromboli, fold both sides of one dough oval up towards the center and pinch them together. Turn the mini-Stromboli over, so the seam side faces down, and set it on your prepared baking sheet. Do this for each of the remaining dough circles.It's important to get a good seal, so the filling won't leak out as the mini-Stromboli bake.
 Cut two to three slits on the top of each dough circle and sprinkle the mini-Stromboli with 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning. Put the baking sheet in the oven and cook the mini-Stromboli for 20 minutes. They should become golden brown.Serve the mini-Stromboli with the remaining 1 3/4 cup (395 g) of marinara sauce.

 A modest amount of social media stalking is pretty standard when you start dating someone, just keep it from getting creepy. You can secretly look at every photo of them for the last four years without scaring them off, but try to avoid making it obvious you're watching their every move. Limit your comments and likes to one or two a week. You should have better things to do, even if you don't have better things to do.
 Desperate people often look to push the relationship too fast. Don't bring up topics like marriage or even make too many references to future dates early in the relationship. Desperate daters are often asking for continual status updates on the relationship and trying to push for more commitment in various ways. Just let things happen and if you are right for each other, it will work out in time., Just because you start dating someone, don't put aside your friends to spend all your time with him. Anyone that drops all their friends for a new date, will come off as very desperate. You can't make yourself too available and you don't want to come off as clingy. Staying true to yourself and your friends will set up healthy boundaries and expectations for a happy relationship.
 By holding on too tightly, you can drive a love interest away. If the guy is right for you and the relationship is going well, he will stick around. If it isn't meant to be, no amount of clinging is going to make it happen. Most of the time, it isn't even the guy you're clinging to, it's the idea of needing a relationship.

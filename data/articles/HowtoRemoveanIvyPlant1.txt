 If you’re working on uncovering a large area of land, you will likely require the help of 2-3 people in the process. You each will need pruning shears or a hacksaw to cut through the largest vines and roots.;
, Ivy grows outwards and can quickly spread to cover a large portion of the ground, easily growing over other plants and objects. A large area completely covered in ivy, typically in a shaded section of land, is called an ivy desert. The first step is to find the edges of this area, and making note of any large plants the ivy covers in the interior of the section.
 Use a pair of pruning shears and work your way around the ivy desert, cutting through the thickest branches and roots. If the area you are working with is quite large, cut through it in smaller sections so that you don’t have to work with so much space at once.
 Stand shoulder-to-shoulder next to your volunteer helpers, and begin to roll the ivy as if it were a giant mat into a log shape. Continue rolling until the entire area of ground has been exposed, and all the ivy is contained within the roll. Depending on the size of the land you’re working on, you may have to create several logs of ivy to carry out.
 Ivy can still re-root itself in the ground even when it has been cut off, so remove the ivy logs you’ve just rolled from the premises. You can dispose of these in a safe place later, after you’ve made sure the ground is ivy-free.
 As aforementioned, it doesn’t take much ivy to start another huge patch. Before heading off in confidence with your ivy logs, be sure to take a few minutes to review the weeded area. Pick up any remaining ivy, and cut/pull out the roots if they are visible.
 A layer of mulch will discourage new ivy from taking hold. To make the vine's comeback even less likely, plant less invasive shade-loving plants such as hostas.

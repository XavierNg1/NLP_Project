 A great way to turn a bad day around is a high intensity workout. Hit the gym and catch a spinning or kickboxing class. Take a short (or long!) run on a local trail. Play flag football with your kids. A little bit of sweat goes a long way and can turn your tears into something positive., A little dancing never hurt anyone. In fact, it just might be the fix for your no good, very bad day. Close your office door, put on your headphones, and bust a move. If your office isn’t conducive to impromptu dance parties, crank up the volume in your kitchen while you’re cooking dinner. Before long you’ll be smiling and that bad day will be moonwalking out the back door., Sometimes yoga is the best way to turn a bad day around. Whether it’s a YouTube video in your living room or a Bikram studio class where you sweat out the day’s frustrations, try using yoga as an antidote to those less than perfect days. You just might want to make a habit of it., The act of massage can have a profound effect on your mood. On a bad day you may notice that your skin is hotter than normal or you are sweating more than usual. A massage can activate and release hidden stores of energy increasing feelings of well-being and alertness in addition to improving circulation and relaxing muscles.

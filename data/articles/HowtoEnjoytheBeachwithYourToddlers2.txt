 Talking a walk along the beach with your toddlers and examining shells and other wildlife can be an enjoyable and educational activity for your toddlers.
 With shovels, spoons, or your hands, you can build and mold sandcastles alongside your toddlers.
 With the use of an object such as a stick or shovel, your toddlers can write their names, or draw shapes and pictures in dry or wet sand.
 Digging holes is often a manageable task for toddlers, and can be made deep enough for your toddlers to sit or stand in, or deep enough for you to be buried by your toddlers.
 In calm waters, you can place masks and snorkels on your toddlers and take them swimming to search for coral reef, wildlife, shells, and other ocean wildlife.
 Playing catch with a beach ball or with other beach-related catching toys can be a fun activity for your toddlers and other family members.

 You can relieve your itchy throat by gargling warm salt water. You may create your own salt water solution by mixing ¼ to ½ of teaspoon of salt to 1 cup of warm water.Gargling every two to three hours should give you some relief to your scratchy throat. Do not use table salt, as it has added iodine and other additives.To gargle the saltwater solution, sip the solution and hold it in your mouth. Then, open your mouth and swish the saltwater solution around in your mouth. Push air from the back of your throat so the saltwater starts to vibrate and gargle around your mouth and throat.
Try not to swallow any of the saltwater, as it can make you sick. Spit out the saltwater after you have gargled it for a few minutes.
 You can prepare your own nasal saline using either distilled or boiled (and then cooled) water.

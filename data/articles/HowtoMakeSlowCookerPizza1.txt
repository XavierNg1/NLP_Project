 Turn a 6 quart (5.7 liter) slow cooker on to HIGH. Keep it on HIGH for 20 minutes, so it preheats. Spray the inside of the slow cooker with cooking spray and get out 8 ounces (225 g) of pizza dough. Roll the dough until it's about the shape of the slow cooker.If your slow cooker is smaller, you can decrease the amount of dough in order to get a thin pizza crust.;
, Carefully transfer the rolled pizza dough to the slow cooker and press it into the bottom of the pan. You'll need to spread and tuck the dough, so a crust forms along the edges. Turn the slow cooker on to HIGH and cook the crust for 1 hour with the lid off.Cooking the dough before adding the toppings helps the crust cook and become a little crisp.
 Take 8 ounces (200 g) of sliced mozzarella cheese and lay the slices on the cooked crust. They should overlap each other and the cover the crust. If you want to add meat, you can lay 8 ounces (230 g) of thinly sliced pepperoni over the cheese slices. Spread 1/2 cup (115 g) of pizza sauce over the toppings and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of grated Parmesan on top.You could use any cooked meat instead of the pepperoni or use your favorite sliced vegetables.
 Turn the slow cooker on to HIGH and leave the lid off. Cook the pizza for 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours. The top of the pizza should appear cooked and the crust should be dark brown. Use a large spatula to carefully lift the whole pizza out of the slow cooker. Slice the pizza and garnish it with:6 fresh basil leaves, sliced into strips
1 pinch of crushed red pepper

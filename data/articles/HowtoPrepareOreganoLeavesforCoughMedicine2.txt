 To make a natural cough syrup, you need garlic, oregano, and honey. You need ½ cup of honey, 2 cloves of garlic, and 2 sprigs of fresh oregano.You can measure out about one teaspoon to one tablespoon of oregano instead.


Garlic, honey, and oregano are antimicrobials that help naturally fight colds and coughs.
You can also add ½ cup of onion and one lemon if you want.
 Boil the garlic cloves and the oregano with about ½ cup of water. Boil for about five minutes., Let the boiling mixture cool for a few minutes, then pour into a cup with the honey. Mix together. Now, it is ready to drink.
 An alternate way to make this cough syrup is to let it set overnight. In a jar, put the oregano at the bottom, then the garlic, then lemon and onion. Pour the honey and water over the ingredients, making sure the water covers all the ingredients completely. Put the lid on the jar so it is airtight, and let it steep overnight. Strain the liquid the next morning and only drink the liquid.Store in your refrigerator for a week.
This makes an even stronger cough syrup because the garlic and onion (if you add onion) are stronger and have more medicinal properties if they aren’t cooked.

 Add the butter to a large, heavy-bottomed skillet and heat it over medium-high heat until the butter melts.


If using oil instead of butter, you should still give the oil a few minutes to warm up before adding anything else to the skillet. The oil should become notably glossy and easier to spread around the bottom of the pan once it is ready, but it should not begin to smoke.;
, Add the buckwheat and toast, stirring frequently, until the grains are coated and slightly deeper in color. This should take about 2 to 3 minutes.


You need to stir the buckwheat constantly as it cooks. Otherwise, the grains can start to burn pretty quickly.
 Slowly pour the liquid into the pan and bring it to a boil. If using water, add salt, as well.


The liquid you choose should be determined based on how you plan to serve the buckwheat. If using it for breakfast, stick with plain water. If using it as a side for lunch or dinner, consider using broth, instead.
 Reduce heat to medium-low or low and cover. Cook until the liquid is absorbed.The buckwheat will not be completely dry. It should look moist and sticky, but any remaining moisture should cling thickly to the buckwheat instead of laying in a puddle at the bottom of the pan.
 Remove the buckwheat from the heat and let it stand for 5 minutes before serving.


This method produces a creamy buckwheat that can be used as cereal or grits.

 In this medical procedure, a saline solution or detergent is inserted into the vein, causing it to become irritated and collapse. Once the vein has collapsed, it is no longer visible under the skin.You can expect one injection per inch of spider vein. The procedure is quick and usually quite painless - the prick of the needle is the only thing you feel.


The side effects include redness, stinging, swelling, and bruising. These usually go away quickly and shouldn't prevent you from doing your normal activities.
The best time to get sclerotherapy is during the winter, when your veins are most visible and easiest to protect. Skin tanned by the summer sun makes spider veins more difficult to see and remove.
The procedure permanently removes existing spider veins, but new ones can develop over time. Additional treatments may be required to keep your legs free of spider veins.You can expect to pay between $300 and $1,000, depending on how many spider veins you have and whether both legs need the treatment.;
, If you are sensitive to needles or allergic to the saline solution used in sclerotherapy, you may want to have a surface laser treatment instead. Strong bursts of light are sent through the skin to the veins, which fade and disappear afterward.


Laser treatment is often painful due to the high temperature of the laser. After treatment, which usually lasts about 20 minutes, a cooling agent is applied to the skin to ease the pain.
Side effects can include redness and swelling, discoloration of the skin, and in extreme cases, scars or burns.
People with certain skin colors and conditions should not use laser treatment, since it can permanently discolor the skin. Ask your doctor whether you're a good candidate for the treatment.

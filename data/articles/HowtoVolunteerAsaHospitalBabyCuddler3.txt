 Once you have been accepted as a volunteer, you will likely need to complete some form of training program. This could include watching health and safety videos as well as learning about the policies and procedures of the hospital environment. Baby cuddlers may need to complete additional training concerning bedside manner and how to handle infants.Take your training seriously. Pay attention, take notes, and ask questions if you need clarification.
 If you are mainly interested in working as a baby cuddler, you should speak with the volunteer coordinator. Ask if there are any openings available in the NICU for volunteer baby cuddlers. Alternatively, you could let your supervisor know that you are interested in the baby cuddling program.
 Baby cuddling is a highly sought after volunteer position in hospitals. As a result, many of these positions are filled. Ask if you can have your name added to the waiting list so that if a position opens up in the future, you will be considered.


Continue to volunteer in other areas of the hospital in order to demonstrate your enthusiasm.

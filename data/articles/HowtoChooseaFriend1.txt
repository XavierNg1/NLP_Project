 Friendships are built on commonalities. People who share a similar interest or experience are more likely to engage with each other and genuinely find one another interesting. To find these people, you have to go out and do things in the community that you enjoy. The other people doing those things are great potential friends. Check your local newspaper and any other local event resources to find out about events in your area. You might even sign up for a mailing list to receive info about an organizationâ€™s events. For example, you might:Volunteer for a cause that you are passionate about.

, Not every co-worker will become a lifelong friend, but there is something to be said about the shared lifestyles of people who work together. On average, you are spending forty or more hours per week doing work in the same field. This gives you a lot of material for conversation. Invite a co-worker to lunch or an evening event to connect with them beyond the workplace. You could also participate in company sponsored events like parties or fundraisers.Having friends in your work field can also boost your chances of moving up in your field.
Be careful about which of your colleagues you befriend to avoid conflicts of interest. For example, it might not be a good idea to befriend someone you supervise because this may result in other employees accusing you of favoritism.

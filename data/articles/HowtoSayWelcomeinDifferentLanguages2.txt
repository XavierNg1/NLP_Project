 This language is partially based in English, so the pronunciation should be easy. The W sounds slightly like a V, almost a hybrid of W & V.


"Vale-come

, Tricky for English speakers, you will have an easier time if you think about it as three separate words that you run together. The first and last sections rhyme.


"Ahh-lehn wa Sa-lehn", It sounds just like it looks. The second syllable rhymes with the English "foam."


"Sha-loam."

, Again, this is a tricky one if you don't break it down into smaller parts. You can also use the more general phrase, "Buyurun," ("Booh-Rohn"), to say hello and welcome all at the same time."Hosh-gel-dinn-iz"

, This is the singular form, meaning it is how you welcome only one person. For plural, you would say "karibuni."

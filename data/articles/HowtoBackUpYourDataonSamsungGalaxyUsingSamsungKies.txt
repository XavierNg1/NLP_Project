 To know your Android’s device OS, from your Samsung Galaxy phone or tablet’s home screen, tap on “Apps” and select “Settings.” Afterwards, click on “About Device” and take a look at the number right below the Android version label to know which Kies software you need.;
, On your computer browser, type http://www.samsung.com/us/kies/ on the search bar and hit Enter.
 Once the Samsung Kies site is up, you will see that there are two versions available for the Kies software, i.e., Kies 2.6 and Kies 3.


Click on the Download tab for Kies 2.6 if you have a Samsung Galaxy device released before September 2013.
Download Kies 3 for Android devices with 4.3 OS and the later versions.
 Once prompted, install Kies into your computer, and click on “Open/Run” when it’s done installing.
 Use a USB cable. Once you connect your devices, Kies will identify your device’s name/model. Click on the Back Up/Restore tab found at the top section of your device summary.
 You can either select items individually or simply choose “Select all” to have a backup of all your data without spending too much time perusing.
 The backup process begins immediately after.


Do not at any point of the process unplug the USB cable from either your computer or Samsung Galaxy device.
The length of time for the process to be completed depends on the amount of data being backed up.
 Do so when the system indicates that the backup is done.


From here on, you can restore backed-up data to your Samsung Galaxy device as needed using the Kies software.

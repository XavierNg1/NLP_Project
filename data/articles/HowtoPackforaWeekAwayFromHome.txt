 If its for 5 days, pack for six just in case. Always have a "just-in-case" outfit.;
, Pack for the amount of days you will be staying plus one. Remember swimsuits (if it applies), pajamas, and jackets (if it applies).
 Or will you be at a hotel where not everything is provided? Doing laundry can be time consuming and expensive and usually, only upscale hotels offer a Laundry Service. This service may be great, but it's expensive!,, Do you use creams or cleansers that you will need? Bring a toothbrush and sample sized tube of paste. If you don't have a toothbrush holder use a baggy. Pack nothing over 100ml in your hand luggage - decant all larger toiletries into 100ml bottles, or the security at the airport will take them.
 Pack clothes that all coordinate with each other. Don't forget under clothes and pajamas! (You may want to have some extra underclothes, so pack for as many days that you are staying plus at least two - it never hurts to be safe.) A good thing to do is pack four pairs of shorts/skirts and 9 tee-shirts or vest tops and matching flip-flops. Also, remember to pack those all too important bathing suits if this guest has a pool. Remember to pack beach towels, sunscreen, and other pool things.


Shoes: Try to pack so that you have outfits that match the shoes you wear to the location, and if not try to only pack one other pair, it really saves space. Is there a pool or beach? You probably only need to pack one pair of flip-flops.
, Remember your cell phone and its charger. This is especially important if you are very far from home--you don't want to be out of touch. Same with your laptop if you're bringing it. Remember its connections and its cord that goes to the wall for charging. As well with an iPod or mp3 player--make sure you have the USB cord and charger for it.
 These include magazines, music and books.
, It's not fun if you forget the DS, iPods, or even phones. You can also bring books

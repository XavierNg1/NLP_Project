 To keep your website compliant and accessible to users who are color-blind, use an additional method other than color to convey important information.For example, you might use blue to indicate words in black text are links to other pages. However, to make your website 508 compliant, you also must use something other than color to show those words are links, such as underlining the word as well.
In addition, all color must include sufficient contrast, and all information must be conveyed both with and without color.;
, If you use style sheets to separate the visual style and display from the content of the text itself, the text should remain visible if the style sheets are turned off.While the text elements may not be as visually appealing with the style sheets turned off, they should still be legible. If the document is confusing or has missing information when the style sheets are turned off, your website doesn't meet Section 508's standards.Although you usually can make a PDF file accessible to assistive technology such as screen readers, you also might want to include an accessible HTML version of the document just in case. You also must provide an accessible HTML version of any PowerPoint files you include on your website.The Department of Health and Human Services has checklists available for making most common document types accessible, including PDF files, Word documents, and Excel spreadsheets.These checklists can be found online at http://www.hhs.gov/web/section-508/making-files-accessible/checklist/index.html.
 Every frame must have a title that describes the frame's purpose and content., If your website has forms that can be filled out online, people using assistive technology must be able to access information contained within them, such as field elements and directions.Any scripting of the form elements can't interfere with assistive technologies or keyboard shortcuts.Form elements such as "<textarea>" or "<input>" also must have descriptive labels.

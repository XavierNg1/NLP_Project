 Unless you have light, stain repellent carpet already, it may look dingy or dark. Consider replacing the carpet with light colored laminate flooring.


Laminate flooring looks like hardwood flooring but is much less expensive. Many people even install it themselves.
 If you canâ€™t replace dark hard wood or carpet, find some cheap indoor-outdoor or artificial turf floor covering, a large jute or sea grass rug. You can also opt for other textures or a light stain repellant rug.

 After you give your pitch, make sure to follow up with the potential sponsor. Companies receive many potential marketing opportunities every day, and it is easy for your proposal to slip through the cracks. Be persistent enough to stay on their radar, but not so pushy that they want to get rid of you.Ask the sponsors things like “Is anything about our pitch that you found appealing?” and “Are there are any ways that we can sweeten the pot?”

, Once you secure a partnership, do not leave company representatives alone at an event. Have a plan in place and assign staff to attend to their needs. Sponsors who have a good time and meet their business goals will sponsor your event again.


If the sponsors have a booth or physical location at the event, make sure that it is fully serviced by your staff.
 From the sponsor’s point of view, find out what worked well and what you can improve. This will help you strengthen your relationship with the sponsor and help ensure that they come back next year. Send a note thanking sponsors for their participation, and invite them to attend next year's event. This can be done through a face-to-face meeting, an email or phone call.

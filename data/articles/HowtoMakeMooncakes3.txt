 After your mooncakes have dried and cooled off on a wire cooling rack, you should put them in an airtight container. Wait to eat your mooncakes for one or two days. They should be soft and also look shiny on the outside., Mooncakes go especially well with tea. Try a vanilla tea with a little bit of spice for your traditional mooncake., Mooncakes are a sweet and decadent food, so you should eat them as a dessert. You can even cut them up into halves or smaller slices if they are too rich for eating in one sitting.
 It is common for mooncakes, even homemade ones, to be packaged in little boxes as gifts. Find some little boxes at a craft store or online, and put your mooncakes into boxes for your friends and family.

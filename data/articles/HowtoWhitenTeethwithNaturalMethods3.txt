This is a slower method that will probably take a few weeks to show significant results.
 You can also add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. Baking soda will help this mixture whiten your teeth better. This is optional, however, and you can just use the strawberry paste if you want., Be sure to use a different toothbrush from the one you regularly brush your teeth with.

Allow the mixture to sit on your teeth for five minutes., Have a glass of water handy and rinse the mixture off your teeth.
 You will probably have to brush more thoroughly than usual, since the strawberry remains may take some scrubbing to get off fully.If you don't floss regularly, you should do so after using this treatment. Strawberries have very small seeds that can get caught between your teeth.

 If your infant is fussy, try to calm them before measuring their pulse. Because their heart rate increases when they are upset, you will not get an accurate measurement. It is important that you get a resting heart rate in order to get an accurate measurement.
 Begin by placing your infant on their back in their crib or another flat surface that they cannot roll off. You will need both of your hands to measure your child’s pulse, so you cannot be holding them. Because their heart rate increases while in a vertical position, placing an infant on their back also helps you get a more accurate pulse.
 Hold your baby’s arm out to its side and place your pointer and middle fingers in the bend of the arm on the inside of the elbow. Press firmly but gently and count the pulse rate for one minute. Repeat the process and compare your findings.Because it is difficult to get to a baby’s carotid artery, it is recommended that you measure the brachial pulse in their arm.

 For the side to side move, just drop your left hip to raise your right hip, and then drop your right hip to raise your left. Start slowly until you perfect this motion, and then speed up until you're shimmying your hips. For the back and forth move, just move your hips back and forth, using the center of your pelvis to make the movement look graceful.


Keep your arm lifted at a ninety degree angle and move your fingers to add balance and grace to your movements.
To move side to side, first lift your right foot and lift your heel until only your toes are touching the ground. Use this movement to pop up your right hip for two counts, and then let it fall lower than normal for two counts. Repeat this movement with your left leg and hip and then alternate until you can shimmy rapidly.
Use your knees to help generate momentum and movement, not your hips.
To master the hip movement, try to mentally divide your torso vertically down the center. This will help you learn to move one side of your hip up and down without affecting the movement of the other hip.
 Try 'drawing' little circles in the air with your one side. As you get the hang of it, try 8's, arcs, and swirls. Don't forget your other side. One side will always be easier, or stronger, depending on whether you are left or right handed. Keep your arms lifted, a slight smile on your face, and your fingers moving as you master these techniques.
 You don't have to belly dance using the same motion all the time. Once you master a few techniques, you can switch things up. Do the left hip circle, the right hip circle, two right hip circles followed by two left, or move your hips back and forth and then transition into moving them from side to side. Remember to continue using your stomach to pull your hips in different directions.

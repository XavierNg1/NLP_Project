 A topographical map is similar to a planimetric map, but it shows the heights of objects above (and below) a chosen reference height, usually assumed to be sea level.
 This will serve as the basis for a topographical map.
 A contour line connects areas of equal height. Make sure that they are well spaced (e.g. every ten metres). Contour lines may not cross over each other. The closer they are together, the steeper the ground is. The only time contour lines are allowed to touch is at a cliff edge, where the height changes very rapidly.
 Don't label every one, you'll be there forever. Usually, only every five or ten lines are labelled.
 Label these dots with the height of the hills.


The picture shows the process of plotting contour lines.

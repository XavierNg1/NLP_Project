 Copic pens come in a variety of colors and nib sizes, just as the markers do. Pens allow for very precise, thin lines when drawing, and sketch markers allow for slightly thicker, but still precise lines.The beginner artist can always draw in pencil first, then go over the lines with a Copic pen or sketch marker when satisfied with the initial sketch.
Alternatively, you can use a rubber stamp to create the outline of a design, then color in the image using Copic markers.
 You can use either end of the Copic marker when coloring. Move the marker in small circles over the area you want to fill in order to cut down on visible lines and streaks.Experiment with using either end of the pen to find out which one works for you when coloring.
 When adding dimension, be sure to pick a color one or two shades darker than the base color, but still in the same color family.


If you don’t know where shading would look best, start with the outer edges of the design., In the space where the darker and lighter shades intersect, color the area with the lighter shade of marker, using circular motions.Copic markers work extremely well for blending, but you must blend while the colors are still relatively wet in order to create a seamless color transition.
 Try using different colors in different areas, practicing blending in each section. Allow the paper to dry completely before touching, framing, or handling in any way.


If you plan on using colored pencils to add depth to an image, apply them as the last layer. The Copic marker’s alcohol-based ink can’t absorb into the paper through layers of pencil.

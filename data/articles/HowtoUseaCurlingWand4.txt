 Before doing tight curls, apply a leave-in conditioner from the roots to the tips. This will help you mold your curls, encouraging them to stay tight., Apply a styling hair gel to your hair, working it in from the roots to the tips. As you apply your gel, scrunch up the ends of your hair using your hands. This should result in your hair taking on a curly appearance.
 Take a blow dryer and gently blow dry the tips of your hair, messing them slightly with your fingers as you go. This will encourage further curling, creating the appearance of small, tight curls.
 Take a round brush and wrap it around the roots of your bangs. Then, pull the brush through your hair. As you pull the brush through, place your blow dryer just below your bangs. This will create a slight curved shape. Brush your bangs to either side, creating a part in the middle of your bangs.








Keep in mind, if you have smaller bangs, this particular look may not work for you. Longer side bangs tend to work better here.
 Wrap your bangs around the curling wand, starting at the root. Hold your bangs for a few seconds and then release them. You should notice a slight curl forming.
 Examine the tips of your hair. If you notice any of your ends lack the nice, tight curl you want, wrap the ends around the curling wand. Hold for a few seconds and then release your hair. This should create tighter, firmer curls. Add curls throughout the tips of your hair to create a nice, tight look.
 Take some hairspray and mist it gently over your hair. This will set your look for the day, keeping your tightly wound curls intact.

 The key to using positive reinforcement is to provide something positive any time the dog achieves the proper behavior. Every time your dog uses the potty spot, you can praise them with kind words. It is crucial for praise to come immediately after the dog goes potty.You might say:


"Good job going potty!"
"Good dog!"
"Good pee!";
, Beyond just kind words, you can positively reinforce good potty behavior by providing a treat any time your dog uses the potty spot correctly. Select a food-based treat that your dog enjoys and that is suitable for their size.Dog treats can be purchased at:


Pet stores
Grocery stores
Through your vet
Online

, Another way to reward your dog for appropriate potty behavior and provide positive reinforcement is to touch your dog lovingly as a form of praise. Make strong eye contact with your dog as your pet them or give them a big hug.You might:


Scratch the dog's head
Pet the dog's back
Pat them lightly

, In order for these rewards to function properly as positive reinforcement, you must time them correctly. Keep some dog treats in your pocket when you take them outside. As soon as they have finished going potty, reward your dog with a combination of:


Treats
Kind words
Physical affection

, In order for your dog's appropriate potty behavior to become an ingrained habit, you have to continually reinforce it. Even after your dog appears to be fully potty-trained, continue to provide praise, loving pats, and sometimes even food treats to keep them motivated and further reinforce good behavior.

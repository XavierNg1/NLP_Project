 Use normal  rounding rules to round up or down. Doing this will make it easier to calculate the percent discount of the number.For example, if the original price of a shirt is $47.89, round the price up to $50.00


, To mentally calculate 10% of a price, think of the price written as dollars and cents with a decimal point. Then, move the decimal point one place to the left. This will show you the number that is equal to 10%.For example, to calculate 10% of $50, think $50=$50.00=$5.00{\displaystyle \$50=\$50.00=\$5.00}. So, 5 is 10% of 50.
 To figure out the number of tens, divide by the percentage by 10 using normal division rules. Don’t worry about fives in the percentage for now.

For example, if a shirt is 35% off, you would need to know how many tens are in 35. Since 35÷10=3.5{\displaystyle 35\div 10=3.5}, there are 3 tens in 35.
 The factor is determined by the number of tens in the percent off. Since you determined what 10% of the price is, find a larger percent by multiplying by the number of tens.

For example, if you found that 10% of $50 is 5, to find out how much 30% of 50 is, you would multiply $5 by 3, since there are 3 tens in 30: 5×3=15{\displaystyle 5\times 3=15}. So, 30% of $50 is $15.
 You will need to do this step if the percent off discount ends in a 5 rather than a 0 (for example, 35% or 55% off). It is easy to calculate 5% by simply dividing 10% of the original price by 2, since 5% is half of 10%.

For example, if 10% of $50 is $5, then 5% of $50 is $2.50, since $2.50 is half of $5.
 This will give you the total estimated discount of the item.

For example, if a shirt is 35% off, you first found 30% of the original price was $15. Then you found that 5% of the original price was $2.50. So adding the values of 30% and 5%, you get $15+$2.50=$17.50{\displaystyle \$15+\$2.50=\$17.50}. So, the estimated discount of the shirt is $17.50.
 This will give you an estimate of the sale price of the item.

For example, if the rounded price of a shirt is $50, and you found the 35% discount to be $17.50, you would calculate $50−$17.50=$32.50{\displaystyle \$50-\$17.50=\$32.50}. So, a $47.89 shirt that is 35% off is about $32.50 on sale.

 You can immediately start using your spouse’s last name after marriage. All you need is to send copies of your marriage certificate to any organization that has a record on you. Your records should be updated free of charge.This applies to both men and women, including those in same-sex marriages.
 If you’re a couple combining names, or if you want to use your maiden name as your middle name, you’ll need to change your name using a deed poll.This is a document you can draw up that states you are abandoning your previous name and using your new name at all times.


You can pay someone £15-35 to draft the document for you.
You can also make your own deed poll by using the sample deed poll available here: https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/make-an-adult-deed-poll.
Have two people witness you sign the document.
 Some organizations, such as banks, will only accept your deed poll if it is enrolled. You can enroll it for £36 at the Royal Courts of Justice. Send your forms to the Queen’s Bench Division, Enforcement Section, Room E15, The Royal Courts of Justice, Strand, London WC2A 2LL., You need to tell people you do business with your new name.

 Do not wear the same pair of socks two days in a row. Socks absorb a lot of sweat and moisture, which is a breeding ground for bacteria that leads to fungus. Sweaty socks also tend to produce a strong odor., When washing your socks, add a liquid disinfectant during the rinse cycle on your washing machine. You can buy a disinfectant online or at a local department store. The package should tell you how much to use.If you're washing pantyhose, soak your pantyhose in a disinfectant before putting them in the washing machine.
 The less moisture your feet are exposed to, the better. Less moisture reduces your risk for developing a fungal infection. When purchasing socks, look for socks that are sweat absorbing to keep moisture minimal.This is especially important for socks you wear during athletic activities.
 Use a disinfectant spray or powder to kill bacteria in your shoes. These sprays or powders are sprinkled on your feet and inside your shoes. This helps kill bacteria and fungus, keeping your feet clean and odor free., If you end up showering in public somewhere like the gym, make sure to put on a pair of flip-flops in the shower. These will protect your feet from any lingering bacteria on the shower floor.

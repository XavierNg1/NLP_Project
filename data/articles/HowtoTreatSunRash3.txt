 The easiest and simplest way to prevent a sun rash is to expose your skin to the sun slowly. The most common areas are the legs, arms, and chest, so take your time in the spring wearing these uncovered.Try exposing one area at a time instead of them all at once. Also try to limit the amount of time you spend in the sun at first to about 10 minutes.


For example, wear a short sleeve shirt with a high collar and long pants to begin with. You can also try shorts with a long sleeve shirt and a high neck. As long as only one new area is uncovered, you can help prevent sun rash., When you are in the sun, put sunscreen on the areas that are exposed to the sun. Make sure you look for a high SPF that protects against UVA and UVB rays, since both can cause sun rash.


Reapply the sunscreen about once every two hours., There are certain times of the day that are considered peak hours for sun exposure and strength. If you are prone to sun rash or want to avoid getting one, try to avoid being in the sun between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. The sun is strongest during these times and you run a higher risk exposure., If you know you are prone to sun rash, you can protect yourself by wearing clothing or items that cover your skin completely. If you are going outside, even it is not hot, wear a light jacket or long sleeve shirt to cover your arms. Wear high-necked shirts to protect your chest and long pants to protect your legs.


Your face is also at risk, so wear a wide brimmed hat or headscarf to protect your skin.

 It is often easiest to shave in the shower or during a bath. Water will soften the skin while the warmth will prevent goosebumps, which can get cut while shaving., Commercially produced shaving gel, lotion or foam can help soften the skin and make a smoother shave possible. Soap, shampoo, or conditioner may be adequate substitutes.


Cover the entire area with a generous amount of lubricant.
If necessary, soap or gel can be reapplied partway through the shaving process.
 When the skin is taut, it is easier to get a smooth shave and prevent cuts.
 Hold the razor in your other hand and start by shaving in the direction of hair growth. If your skin is sensitive, shaving against the grain can result in razor burn. If sensitivity is not an issue, shave both up and down, as underarm hair may grow in many different directions.Avoid pressing the razor too firmly against your skin, as this can result in razor burn.
 For the smoothest shave it is best to remove foam and cut hair strands.


Do not attempt to dislodge hair or otherwise clean the razor with your fingers. You will cut them.
 It may take some practice to use your non-dominant hand to shave, but over time this will become easier.
 Rinse under both arms to remove any remaining foam or loose hair. The skin is likely to be sensitive, so consider using a gentle moisturizer after you dry off.


Deodorants may sting if applied immediately after shaving.
Consider shaving at night to allow the skin to rest and heal before applying any products.
If irritation or inflammation persists consult a dermatologist or try a different process.

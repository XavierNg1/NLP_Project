 You are solving the problem 4 x 3. This is really another way to say "3 groups of four."


You can think of this as repeated addition, where the number four will be repeated 3 times. But you are adding the number the amount of times you want to multiply it by.;
, Knowing that each of the four groups have three objects, add 4 three times. 4 + 4 + 4 = 12


You can also find 4 groups of 3 instead. This will give you the same answer. Just add up the numbers in the problem 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 and you will get 12, the same answer.

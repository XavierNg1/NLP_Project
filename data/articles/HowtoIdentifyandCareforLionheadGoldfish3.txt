 What this means is that they will eat both meats, and plants. They are not picky eaters, and will eat flake foods, live meat, or frozen meat, however, if you are to feed them meat, it is best for the food to be deceased, as again, Lionheads are pretty slow. Lionheads should be fed around two to three times a day. Lionheads love:


Flake Food
Live food such as worms, shrimp, algae, and other fish
Plants and Vegetables

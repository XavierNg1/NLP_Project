 You can keep your eyes open for the USPS logo at places you frequently shop.


Stamps are usually sold at:

ATMS
banks
big box stores
gas stations
grocery stores
office supply stores
pharmacies



, If you're having trouble locating a retail location that sells stamps, get online and search the USPS's site for a list of nearby locations.


Go to usps.com and click on the "Quick Tools" heading. Select "Find USPS Locations" and select "Approved Postal Providers" under the Location Types heading. Enter your geographic information and search.
 Once you've found a location that sells stamps, you will usually buy them at the check-out or customer service.


Keep in mind that there are no laws governing the resale price of postage stamps. Merchants can sell stamps to customers at a profit, so pay attention to the price you are being charged if you buy your stamps this way.

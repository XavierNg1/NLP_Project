 Woks come in a two bottom styles -- round- and flat-bottomed. Round woks are traditionally used in Chinese cooking, but they don’t work as well on Western stoves. They won’t work at all on electric ranges, and they’re difficult to cook with on a gas range too. Instead, opt for a flat-bottomed wok.If you happen to have a professional style range, such as a Viking or Wolf, you can use a traditional round-bottomed wok with a wok ring to steady it. While most consumer ranges don’t get hot enough for use with a wok ring, a professional model does.
You don’t want your wok to be too flat because it will be difficult to flip the food correctly. Choose one that has a 4- to 5-inch flattened bottom with sloping sides that flare out.;
, While woks come in a variety of sizes, a 12- to 14-inch style is usually the best option for home cooks. If you buy a wok that’s larger, it’s usually too difficult to maneuver in a small kitchen. However, you don’t want to get one that’s too small either because the pan can become too crowded so your food doesn’t cook evenly.A 12- to 14-inch wok is ideal because it provides plenty of space for your ingredients to heat evenly, as well as enough room for flipping and moving the food around when you’re stir frying.
 Woks typically come three materials: stainless steel, cast iron, and carbon steel. Avoid stainless steel options because they are very heavy, require a long time to heat and cool, and often have food stick to them. Cast iron is better, but it can be fragile and take a long time to heat. Carbon steel is the best option for a wok because it heats evenly, is durable, and doesn’t cost as much as other materials.When you’re purchasing a carbon steel wok, opt for one that is at least 14-gauge and 2-mm thick.
Don’t purchase a wok with a non-stick coating. Those types of coating aren’t designed to be used at high heat, but stir frying in a wok requires high temperatures. A carbon steel wok will become naturally non-stick over time.

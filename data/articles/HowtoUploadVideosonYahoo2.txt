 Locate the app on your mobile device. The app icon carries the Flickr logo. Tap on it.
 Tap the gear button on the top right corner to access the Preferences window.
 Do this by tapping the “Auto-Uploadr” option from the Preferences menu. The “Auto-Upload” screen will display a list of Auto-Uploadr settings.
 The mobile app is quite limited in terms of uploading. The only way to upload your photos and videos to Flickr using the app is to allow it to automatically upload everything. Tap the toggle button for the “Auto Upload” option to turn it on. Once enabled, all your photos and videos from the past, present, and future stored on your mobile media gallery will be uploaded to Flickr. This is a hassle-free way to backup your memories directly to Flickr.

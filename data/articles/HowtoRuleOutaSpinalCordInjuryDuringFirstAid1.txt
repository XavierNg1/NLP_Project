 If you haven’t done so already, call for help. Report concise details about the injury, the victim’s relevant information, and your exact location. In the meantime, provide first aid care as needed, taking care not to move the victim. Keep the head, neck, and back still and in alignment.;
, Spine protection and immobilization does not take priority over life-saving care.Life-saving procedures include CPR or stopping a bleeding wound. You should, however, modify the CPR technique if you suspect the victim may have injured their spine, or does not have a pulse.


Do not open the airway by tilting the head. Instead, use your fingers to gently lift the jaw forward.
Proceed with chest compressions if the person has no pulse.
 Remove the injured person from the accident scene in a safe manner. Have them lay down on a flat surface, if they aren’t already. Use a backboard, wooden door, or similar object to keep the back and neck straight when removing someone from water. Encourage them to keep calm and stay still.
 Once you’ve completed any necessary life-saving procedures, your immediate response must include immobilizing and protecting the spine. Roll up towels and place them on either side of the neck, or hold the victim’s head and neck in place. The ideal position for the patient is to lay flat on the back in a neutral position.If they can easily move their neck and spine into a neutral position, have them do so.
If there is pain or any resistance, you should abandon efforts to align their neck or back.
If they are unconscious but their spine is not in a neutral position, it’s best to wait for emergency personal to decide whether or not to make a manual adjustment.

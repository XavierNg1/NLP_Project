 If you're opting to use real mulberry leaves, you'll need a steady source to ensure that they're fresh. Some experts advise that the mulberry leaves should be fresh and moist to ensure a healthy batch of silkworms.Make sure the leaves are free of pesticides, as these toxins could kill your silkworms., Using fresh mulberry leaves is easier than making your own chow, but you can't just toss some leaves into your silkworm habitat. The leaves you serve should be sized appropriately for the silkworms you're raising.Young silkworms can only eat young leaves. Older leaves are too tough for young silkworms to eat.
Newly hatched silkworms should only be fed tiny new growth mulberry leaves measuring approximately 0.5 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 centimeters) long.Older silkworms can safely eat larger, older leaves.
 Your silkworms will readily eat the leaves you give them. Over time, though, they may stop eating for extended periods. This is normal; silkworms molt three or four times during their growing period, and they typically stop eating or moving just before a molt.

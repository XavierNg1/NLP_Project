 Although the methodology sounds a little strange, boiling the pumpkin seeds first lends them a full flavor. (And you don't even have to worry about waterlogged seeds.)








, For every half cup of pumpkin seeds you're roasting, use 2 cup of water and 1 teaspoon of salt.
 The best way to do this is by hand, although you can also use an old (cleaned) comb. Use the comb to separate the pumpkin seeds from the fibrous, fleshy parts.
 Remove and drain in a colander.
, Small seeds will be brown and crispy after 5 to 7 minutes, medium seeds will take around 10-15 minutes, and large seeds could take as long as 20 minutes to cook. Allow to cool before eating.

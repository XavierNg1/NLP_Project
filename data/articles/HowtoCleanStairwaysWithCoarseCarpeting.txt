 Using your broom, sweep horizontally across the top stair. Make sure to get any visible debris all to one side of the stair. To get this done right, you may need to press down hard while sweeping across.;
, The debris doesn't have to land on the next stair, just make sure that you are sweeping it down toward the landing.
 Repeat steps 1 & 2 on this step

, Make sure that you don't lose any of your debris on the way down.
 Sweep the debris you have collected on the landing into the middle of the landing. Make sure to carefully scour the edges of the landing with your broom. Don't leave the landing looking as bad as the staircase that you just swept!

, Toss it into the nearest trash can. Try to get as much as you can with this process. Any left over pieces of small debris (such as sand , dirt, shavings, etc.) can be vacuumed later.
 Many staircases have twists, turns, and extensions that require multiple landings. Make sure to treat each set of stairs up to each landing separately.
 Using your vacuum, vacuum each stair. This makes sure that you get all the lint and dust that the broom may have left behind.

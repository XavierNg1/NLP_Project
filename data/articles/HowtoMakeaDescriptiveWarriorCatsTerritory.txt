 What do the Clan cats look like? What is the Clan called? What do they hunt? You want to make sure that they all fit together.;
, You should have all of these questions answered:


Where do your cats hunt?
Where do apprentices train?
Where are all the herbs found?
Where have battles been fought?
Are there any dangerous areas?
Where is bedding found?
Where do they hunt? (include great hunting spots, lesser hunting spots, and places where prey is slightly scarce)

, This isn't difficult. Prey usually stays near food. You can say prey is there because there are fruits, nuts, berries, herbs, etc. You can say badgers are attracted to the nice dens, that snakes stay in the rocks, that there is quicksand, or that the rocks are slippery and a cat could fall.
 Once you have the drawing, look at it. Figure out where you might decide to make your camp if you lived there.


Pick somewhere that isn't too near a river, a dangerous area, or somewhere prey is abundant. If they stayed near water, there would be floods. If they stayed near a dangerous area, kits would sneak out and get hurt less than a fox-length out of camp. If they were too close to prey, the prey would be scared away.
 You should add a leader's den, a medicine den, a warriors' den, an apprentices' den, and elders' den, and a nursery.

 Measure 1/2 cup (107 g) of xylitol into a small saucepan. Add 1 teaspoon of agave nectar and stir the mixture well.If you're looking for another natural sweetener, you could use honey or maple syrup instead of the agave nectar.
 Turn the heat on to medium and stir the mixture constantly. Cook the xylitol caramel until it turns golden. This should take about 5 minutes. Let the caramel cool before you use it.Avoid letting the caramel get very dark since the xylitol can burn easily.
 Since the xylitol caramel will be very thin, you may want to thicken it up if you'll be dipping something into it or you just want a thicker sauce. To thicken the caramel, put it in the freezer for several minutes.Store leftover caramel sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

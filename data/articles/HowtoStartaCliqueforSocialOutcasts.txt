 Don't just walk up to someone and say, "Hey, you seem like just the loser I'm looking for. Wanna join my group?" Be NICE. Approach them, strike up a conversation, then maybe ask if they want to join your group.;
, Maybe ask them all to sit with you at lunch or ask them to come to a certain place at a certain time (For example, meet in the library at 10 o'clock or something along these lines).
 When or if you do, don't treat it as a sign of authority (unless that is what you wish). It may burn bridges between you and your fellow friends.


The Alpha is the overall "leader." He/she usually is the most outspoken, and is usually not afraid to speak his/her mind.
The Beta is the Alphas right-hand man (or woman). It is the Betas responsibility to keep everyone in check, including the Alpha. He/she may be put in charge of a task like organizing get-togethers.
There may be a few "Gammas" in your clique, who may serve as insiders to the group. They may survey the other groups, as well as other people, and report it. They don't necessarily have to be outcasts, either. Just a few extra buddies to show that you're not just a bunch of ominous people hanging around secretively.
 Text, Call, or Study together periodically. However, you do not have to meet up outside of school at all. Sometimes, people like their in-school and out-of-school lives kept separate.

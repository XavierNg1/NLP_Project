 Another good way of making a bomb bag is to wrap baking soda inside paper towel and place it in a sandwich bag of vinegar. The baking soda gradually mixes with the vinegar, working in a similar way as using two bags, though easier to activate. To begin, place ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of vinegar and ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of warm water inside a snack sized bag., To make the small pack of baking soda, place one tablespoon (14.78 ml) of baking soda in the middle of a 6 by 6 inch (15.24 by 15.24 cm) square of paper towel. Then fold the sides of the paper towel in to make a sort of parcel that holds the baking soda.The satchel of baking soda doesn’t have to be completely foolproof, but it should be able to sit without the sides folding down and the baking soda pouring out.
 Once you make the parcel of baking soda, place it carefully inside the sandwich bag, making sure that no baking soda falls out of the satchel before you have time to seal the bag., After you place the satchel inside the sandwich bag, immediately seal the zip on the sandwich bag. Then give the bag a shake until you see the satchel coming undone and the baking soda pouring out., Once you see that the satchel has unfolded and the baking soda is mixing with the vinegar, toss the bag down somewhere outside or on an easily cleanable surface. Watch the bag expand and then explode like a bomb.

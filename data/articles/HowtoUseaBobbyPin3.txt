 If you do not have any bobby pins, you can buy a pack in any drugstore; look for them in the hair accessories aisle. However, salon professionals recommend premium bobby pins, which are more expensive but hold hair more securely., You can put the ponytail at any height; this is based on your preference and the length of your hair.


Use a comb or brush to help smooth your hair as you pull it back into the ponytail.
 Avoid using hair ties with metal fasteners, as those will get caught in your hair and damage it.


Wrap the hair tie enough times to hold the ponytail securely but not so tightly that it might break your hair. About three times should do the trick.
 You can flip it over the top of your head, if your hair is long enough, or you can hold it up with one hand.


Hold the ponytail upward against the back of your head so that you can reach its underside.
, Insert it at a slight downward angle, and push the bobby pin down until it touches your scalp.Do this gently so that you do not scratch yourself.
 Grab the ponytail and squeeze it tighter, like you would when you are securing the ponytail on your head.Grab the hair on the sides of the ponytail and pull out to the sides. This pushes the elastic hair tie closer to your scalp, tightening the ponytail.
You can also grab the top and bottom of the ponytail and pull them gently up and down, respectively, to give your ponytail more volume.

 Click its program icon from your computer’s desktop or program list to launch and open an Internet Explorer browser.
 Go to Google Toolbar’s website, and click the “Download” button to go to its installation page.


Click on “Accept and Install” and the toolbar will be automatically installed on your Internet Explorer.
 Visit a page that’s written in a language you cannot understand. Try searching for foreign websites on Google, or if you already have one in mind, open it on Internet Explorer.
 As soon as the website loads, Google Toolbar will tell you that the web page is in another language and will ask if you want to translate it. Click the “Translate” button on the top right corner of the browser window to convert the language to IE’s set language.


For example, if your Internet Explorer’s browser language is set to “English,” it will translate the page to the English language.
 Once the page has been translated, put a checkmark on the option “Always Translate” found on the top right corner of the browser window along the Google Toolbar to activate Google Translate for that page. Every time you visit that web page, its contents will be automatically translated.

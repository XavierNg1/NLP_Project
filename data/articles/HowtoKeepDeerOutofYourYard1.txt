 Human hair can repel deer, so get some from your local barber or hairdresser (it should be free of charge).;
, The scent of multiple humans from the hair will deter the deer.
 Hang the sock or stocking in your vegetable garden with the same effect. Make it thickest at row ends and around outside rows of the vegetable patch or garden bed.


Make sure the sock or stocking has an attractive and pleasant appearance; not only do you want to keep the deer away, but you also want to make your garden appear classy and beautiful! A ratty, old sock or a stocking with a disgusting color will bring down your garden's appearance and possibly make your neighbors believe you have a bad taste in style.

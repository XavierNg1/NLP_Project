 Having these staples is great, but in order to stand out and really look like a popular person, you need to add something extra to your outfits. Throwing in a pop of unexpected color or adding a great purse to your outfit are an easy way to do this. Get ideas of how to personalize your outfits by looking around at the popular kids and seeing how they do it, and then make it your own., When putting your personality into your outfit, try to do so with a piece that people can ask you about. An interesting piece of jewelry, or a fun scarf are good conversational pieces. Anything that will create questions from people will work. Be prepared to have a conversation about it; don’t simply thank them and move on. Act as approachable as you look.
 Being popular means you have friends. The easiest way to do that—regardless of the clothes you’re wearing—is by wearing a big smile. This makes people feel comfortable around you and makes them want to be your friend.

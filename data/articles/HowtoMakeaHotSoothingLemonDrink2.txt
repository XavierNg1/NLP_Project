 Use a knife to cut the root into several manageable pieces. Remove the skin by scraping the root with the edge of a spoon. Discard the skin. Scratch the peeled ginger rapidly across the tines of a fork. This will shred the root's flesh into small bits., Add the grated ginger. Freshly grated ginger is warming and can help loosen and expel mucus and chest congestion.


Ginger may also reduce swelling, improve circulation and provide antibacterial properties.
 Cover it until it comes to a boil. Remove the saucepan from heat. Allow the ginger to steep in the hot water for 10 to 15 minutes.
 While youâ€™re waiting for the water to boil, prepare the lemon juice. Slice the lemons in half, then squeeze each lemon half over a clean bowl. Squeeze until the fruit stops yielding juice.


Check your bowl for lemon seeds and discard any that may have fallen in.
Set the freshly squeezed lemon juice aside for now.
 After the grated ginger has steeped in the hot water for 15 minutes it will need to be removed. Hold a mesh strainer over a large bowl or pitcher. Carefully pour the hot water through the strainer.


The water will go into the bowl and the grated ginger pieces will be caught in the strainer.
Discard the grated ginger bits after straining them out.
 Pour your freshly squeezed lemon juice into the bowl or pitcher of hot ginger water. Stir gently to combine the ingredients. You will have six to eight servings. Pour one serving into a mug and serve immediately. Sip on the remaining mixture throughout the day, warming it up in the microwave if necessary.


Add a spoonful of honey (or to taste) to your mug, if you like. Honey will coat and soothe a sore throat.
If you have any leftovers, put the liquid in an airtight container and place it in the refrigerator. The beverage will be good for up to three days.

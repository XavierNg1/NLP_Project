 Depending on the device, you'll do this in one of a few different ways:



Phone or tablet - Connect your device using the USB charging cable.

Flash drive - Plug the flash drive into a USB port.

Camera SD card - Insert the SD card into your PC's card reader.

CD or DVD - Insert the disk into the CD tray.
 To do so, simply click Yes or Allow in the pop-up window that occurs. This will usually only happen if it's your first time connecting the external device.


Your device may also need to download drivers before you can continue.
 Doing so will open a window with device options.


Skip this step if you're using Windows 7.
 It appears near the top of the window.
 It's at the bottom of the window.


On Windows 7, you'll instead click Next.
 You'll see this button at the bottom of the window. Your selected photos will begin copying into your computer's "Pictures" folder.


You can also check the "Delete imported items..." box to remove your imported items from the external device after importing.

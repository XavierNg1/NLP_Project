 Shake a few ounces of the baking soda into a Tupperware container or quart-sized Ziploc bag.









Make sure that the container you choose has a lid or some other means of closing and sealing.
Baking soda is often touted for its ability to absorb and trap stubborn smells so that they can be dealt with without the need for deep-cleaning., Slip the insoles into the baking soda so that they’re completely submerged. It may help to position them upside down so that the entire upper surface will stay in constant contact with the powder. The more surface area the baking soda covers, the better it will work.








The insoles should be mostly dry before you apply the baking soda.
If you’re unable to find a suitable container, set the insoles out and sprinkle the baking soda directly over the top., Seal the container and find an out of the way place to store it. By the time you wake up the following morning, the baking soda should have locked in the strongest odors.For best results, the baking soda should be allowed to do its thing for at least 6-8 hours.
Baking soda is one of the simplest solutions for persistent odors, as it doesn’t require any scrubbing, wiping or washing., Open the container and dispose of the baking soda. Shake the remaining powder off of the insoles and let them sit out in the open for a few minutes before putting them back in your shoes. Afterwards, you should no longer be able to notice any unwanted smells.








Baking soda treatments can be used as often as you need to keep your insoles from stinking up your shoes.

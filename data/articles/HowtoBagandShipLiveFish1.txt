 Place the fish in a separate tank with the proper temperature and very clean water. It's best you not feed the fish for about two days. Check for any signs of disease, since you don't want to sell your customer diseased fish.;
, When shipping fish, it is best to do it via overnight shipping. This usually more expensive, but the fish has best chances of arriving alive with this method.
 Fill the rest of the bag up with fresh air, or oxygen.


Triple, or quadruple bag the fish (put the bags inside each other).
Tightly rubber band the bags closed. Attach a clip just in case also.



Place the bagged fish in the styrofoam box. This will help insulate the water inside, and keep it a the right temperature. Line the inside of the styrofoam box with newspaper, so the bag doesn't shake too much.
Use heat/cold packs wrapped in newspaper depending on the climate and type of fish. For example, if they're tropical fish add heat packs to the box.
Tightly seal the styrofoam box shut, and place into a cardboard box. Tightly seal the cardboard box too.
 Contact the buyer and make sure that they will be ready to receive the fish when it gets there. Consider shipping the fish via air with a reputable airline. There are several that are skilled in shipping what they call "Live Tropical Fish".


Add labels to the outside of the box, like "fragile", or "live fish", or "this side up".

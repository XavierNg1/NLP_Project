 After you’ve drafted your essay, walk away from it for a while. This could be for a few hours or a few days. Once you come back to it, it can be easier to see where it needs editing, what you can keep, and what just doesn’t work.For example, write your admissions essay on a Saturday morning and then don't look at it again until Sunday or Monday night. After writing it, you'll have a better idea of what you actually wanted to say. It will be obvious after some time away where you're saying what you mean and what areas need work.
 Once you've drafted your essay, you should reread and edit it more than once. Read your essay first to make sure that it says exactly what you want it to say. Then read it again for spelling and grammar errors.You can also ask someone else to proofread your essay for you. Asking a teacher, parent, or older sibling is probably the best way to go, since they might be more familiar with what's expected from college admissions essays., Make sure that your essay does not exceed the maximum word and page length. This might mean cutting out whole sentences or it might mean using less words to say the same thing. If you have trouble with this, ask a friend to check your writing for unnecessary words.For example, instead of saying "I want to tell you about the process I went through to decide to become a doctor," you could say, "I want to share how I decided to become a doctor."

, Don’t use the same words over and over in your essay. Most word processing software has a “thesaurus” function. If you find you’re repeating the same words, use it.Make sure you're replacing your original vocabulary with words that mean the same thing. Different words have different connotations, and not every suggestion from the thesaurus will have the exact meaning you’re looking for.

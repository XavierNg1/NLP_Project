 To find a partner or a fianc√©(e), get one of your teddy bears or if you don't have a suitable one, you could invite a friend over and use one of their teddy bears. Make sure the two get on well together, you wouldn't marry someone you don't like!;
, Decide if you want a more casual (less fancy) or formal (fancier) wedding. For a location, you could use your bedroom or the garden. Hang up streamers and decorate the area. Also hang up a banner that says their names on it.
 You can write your own vows or find some on the internet or in books. Just make sure that the vows are meaningful if you decide to make your own.
 Use pretend wedding cake (or a small real one) and other various munchies. If it's a formal wedding, use fancier cake and munchies. If it's more casual, all that really matters is that it's tasty and arranged in a pretty manner., If you have a female teddy and you want her to wear a dress, you could sew a dress (see related articles for more articles on making dresses), or you could find another teddy who has a dress and use that. Just make sure you give the dress back after you are finished. Another thing you could do, is buy a dress from Build a Bear. Or if the wedding is more casual, less fancy things will do. Do the same for the boy, getting him a suit for a formal wedding or a different outfit for a casual wedding. By the way, you can also have a wedding for two girls or two boys - love is for everyone!

, You can find other teddies and soft toys for flower girl, ring bearer, maid/matron of honor, brides maids, best man, grooms men and the Justice of the Peace. And don't forget to invite friends and families!

, Hand out some invitations to you and your friend's teddies.
 You can even have them start a family!

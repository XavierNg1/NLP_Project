 Potato curry can be complemented by many different types of spices, proteins, and vegetables. Try adding one cup of fresh cooked peas in the saucepan, and mix with the potatoes and spices.
 Chop two cups of fresh spinach, and add it to the potato curry as it is cooking on the stove. Mix the spinach in well with the other ingredients., Cook about 4 oz. of chicken in a separate pan until it is fully cooked. Cut the chicken into small pieces, and add it in with the other ingredients as they are cooking on the stove., After you add the potatoes, mix in 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt and 2 tbsps of sour cream for a thick, creamy mixture. This is just a starting base. You can add more or less depending on how thick or creamy you want your dish.,

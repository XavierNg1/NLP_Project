 Lettering is often an afterthought when novice artists are drawing comics. Lettering can give the action that last needed impact, or deflate the whole situation if done incorrectly. Speech bubbles and sound effects are artwork and should be given due attention. Think about where your focal points are in each panel and place bubbles accordingly.


Lettering advances the story and should follow the same zigzag method to facilitate an easy to follow flow for the reader.
 Instead of drawing a word bubble with lettering and an exclamation point, use colorful block lettering in a burst balloon. A burst balloon has jagged edges and creates a sense of urgency.


Think about the onomatopoeia of your sound effects. If you’re writing “BLAM” to show a gunshot, consider what those letters should look like. Are the big, bold and colored in to create a loud, ringing sound? Or are they hollow block letters that sound more like a quick cracking noise.
Place your sound effects somewhere that draw the eye to the next panel.
 Use a point of focus in your background that show depth. Action, or speed lines are a very effective way to create motion and action in a scene. Instead of drawing a detailed background, sometimes action lines drawing to a single point in the background can create the proper feeling of movement.If a character is running at you, draw lines like the iris of an eye around the character to make it look like that character is moving forward.
If a character is moving left or right, draw speed lines trailing your character.
Another way to draw action is to draw spit or debris flying. If someone is getting punched, draw trails of spit flying away.

 Building a farm in Minecraft can be pretty easy sometimes, but it's always nice to make them organized! Make sure when you surround it with fences, they are the same type and have a space to walk through if you plan on putting animals., If you plan on adding animals, try making a separateÂ area for each type of animal. For example, try putting Sheep in one area and Pigs in another. Try to make them next to each other but still separated by fences., You don't want to think you're getting Wheat when you're actually getting Pumpkin!, When you do, try not to make it some weird-looking puddle. Instead, try making it a line of water by your fence.,

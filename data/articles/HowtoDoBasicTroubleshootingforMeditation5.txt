 Practicing daily mindfulness really does help dramatically in meditation as you see that what you experience with your eyes shut, is much the same as with your eyes open in your daily life. The more you observe during the day, the more you can observe in meditation.


However, accept that no one practices it perfectly from the beginning. It is just like being an athlete, no one becomes a champion without lots of training and practice.
 Relax, the world is not going to end if you miss something or feel tired. There are reasons why kindness and compassion are central to Buddhism.
 This is a very deep and complex subject and it's proportional to your depth of examination and application as to the depth of insight you will reach. Cursory examination will result in virtually nothing deeper even if you do it all the time because you aren't probing into anything in order to see deeper.


The whole aim of looking at these things is to see everything as it happens without your interference or judging, so it happens on it's own. That way you can see what really happens and can act to make the best quality experience.

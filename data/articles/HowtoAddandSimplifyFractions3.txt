 You want to  factor the numerator into all of its prime factors. Remember that a prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself. Rewrite the fraction showing this prime factorization in the numerator.

For example, if simplifying the fraction 2490{\displaystyle {\frac {24}{90}}}, you would calculate that 24=2×2×2×3{\displaystyle 24=2\times 2\times 2\times 3}. So, rewrite the fraction as 2×2×2×390{\displaystyle {\frac {2\times 2\times 2\times 3}{90}}}


, You also want to factor the denominator into its prime factors. Rewrite the fraction showing its prime factorization in the denominator.For example, if simplifying the fraction 2490{\displaystyle {\frac {24}{90}}}, you would calculate that 90=2×3×3×5{\displaystyle 90=2\times 3\times 3\times 5}. So, rewrite the fraction as 2×2×2×32×3×3×5{\displaystyle {\frac {2\times 2\times 2\times 3}{2\times 3\times 3\times 5}}}.
 Remember that when a factor is common to the top and bottom of a fraction, it cancels to 11{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{1}}}. This means you can eliminate these factors, since any number multiplied by 1 is itself.For example, you can cancel out a 2 and a 3 in the numerator and denominator: 2×2×2×32×3×3×5{\displaystyle {\frac {{\cancel {2\times }}2\times 2{\cancel {\times 3}}}{{\cancel {2\times }}{\cancel {3\times }}3\times 5}}}. 


, You want to simplify the fraction so that it only includes the factors that did not cancel. If more than one factor remains in either the numerator or denominator, you need to multiply them together to get a single integer. The result will be your simplified fraction.

For example:2×2×2×32×3×3×5{\displaystyle {\frac {{\cancel {2\times }}2\times 2{\cancel {\times 3}}}{{\cancel {2\times }}{\cancel {3\times }}3\times 5}}}2×23×5{\displaystyle {\frac {2\times 2}{3\times 5}}} 415{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{15}}}So, the fraction 2490{\displaystyle {\frac {24}{90}}} simplifies to 415{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{15}}}.

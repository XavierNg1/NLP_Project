 If you still have new file corruption, data corruption, new CRC errors, additional SMART CRC errors, etc, possibly your hard drive is failing and needs to be replaced. One way to determine if this is the case is that sometimes when hard drive is failing, it makes different noises than usual. Sound for normal hard drive operation, is sort of like soft, gentle finely grained sound somewhat similar to stepping on very fine gravel with padded shoes. If you hear more sudden, sharp, raspy, pinging, or louder grating type sounds, and it is not normal pattern for your hard drive, it is possible it may be failing. When hard drives are failing, they don't always make these unusual types of sounds, but sometimes they do.

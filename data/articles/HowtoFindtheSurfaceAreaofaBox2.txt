 This only works with right cylinders, meaning they are not slanted. The proper formula is SurfaceArea=2B+hC{\displaystyle SurfaceArea=2B+hC}  For example, if the area of the base is 3, the height is 5, an the circumference is 6, what is the surface area? Answer = 36 units squared.


B is the area of the base.


h is the height of the cylinder.


C is the circumference of the base., The base is the circular end of the cylinder. It can be found with the formula Area=pi∗r2{\displaystyle Area=pi*r^{2}} R is the radius of the circle. Pi is the constant, rounded to 3.14 for simple problems. You can also leave it as "pi" if you do not have a calculator.


Example: The radius of the base in a cylinder is 2. What is the area of the base?


pi∗(2)2{\displaystyle pi*(2)^{2}}

B = 4pi{\displaystyle 4pi}


, The circumference is the distance around the edge of the circle. It is found with the formula Circumference=2∗r∗pi{\displaystyle Circumference=2*r*pi} Continuing the previous example:


2∗pi∗(2){\displaystyle 2*pi*(2)}

C = 4pi{\displaystyle 4pi}


, The height of a cylinder is just another way to figure out how long it is. It is the straight line between the center of the two bases.


Example: In the same cylinder, with radius 2 inches, the height is 5 inches.


h=5{\displaystyle h=5}


, Once you've got your base area, circumference, and height, all you need to do is plug the numbers into your formula to get the right answer.


SurfaceArea=2B+hC{\displaystyle SurfaceArea=2B+hC}


SurfaceArea=2(4pi)+(5)(4pi){\displaystyle SurfaceArea=2(4pi)+(5)(4pi)}


SurfaceArea=8pi+20pi{\displaystyle SurfaceArea=8pi+20pi}


SurfaceArea=28pi{\displaystyle SurfaceArea=28pi}


, All problems of surface area need units to give them scale. Is the area in inches, or feet, for example. The units always match the units given to you in the problem. If no units are given, you should just write the phrase "units squared," or "units2{\displaystyle units^{2}}"

In the example, the units were given as inches. So the final answer would be 28pi{\displaystyle 28pi} inches2{\displaystyle inches^{2}}

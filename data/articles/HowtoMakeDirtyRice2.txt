 Place the rice in a fine mesh colander and rinse well under cool, running water.


Typically, the water draining off the rice will look cloudy initially. Wait until that water runs clear before you stop rinsing the rice.
 Place the butter in a large skillet and set it over medium-high heat. Allow the butter to completely melt before continuing to the next step.Turn the pan as the butter melts so that it can coat the entire bottom.
 Add the garlic and onion to the melted butter. Cook, stirring frequently, for 2 or 3 minutes.


Allow both ingredients to become aromatic. The garlic should deepen in color and the onion should start looking translucent, but do not allow either ingredient to begin burning.
 Add the ground sausage, chopped chicken livers, chopped celery, and chopped bell pepper to the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking until the sausage and livers are well-browned.


During this time, the celery and bell pepper should also become notably tender.
Stir the contents of the skillet frequently to prevent them from burning and to help meld the flavors together.
 Dump the rinsed rice into the rice cooker. Pour the skillet mixture on top, followed by the parsley, Cajun seasoning, salt, black pepper, and chicken stock. Mix until evenly combined.
 Cover the rice cooker and switch the machine to the "standard rice" or "white rice setting." Cook until the device alarms.Open the lid and stir the contents once the timer alarms. If the rice still seems hard, add as much as an additional 1/2 cup (125 ml) of stock or broth, cover, and cook in 10-minute intervals until done.
You should cook the mixture on the "white rice" setting even if you choose to use brown rice. If you do use brown rice, do not open the lid when the device alarms. Instead, allow it to sit on the "warm" setting for another 15 minutes before checking the contents and proceeding as needed.
 Dirty rice is best enjoyed warm, so serve it as soon as the dish has finished cooking.

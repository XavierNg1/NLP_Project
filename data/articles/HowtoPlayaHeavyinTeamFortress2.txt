 Heavies are armed with an outstanding 300 health. Add the Medic's 150 health boost and Heavies hold the highest amount of health possible, 450. Aside from the health, they also boast the slowest speed possible but also holds a dangerous 200 bullet Minigun, a 6/32 medium ranged Shotgun and their own powerful Fists that can dent metal.;
, A heavy medic combo is devastatingly strong, and and an ubercharged heavy can take down groups of enemies and destroy entire mini bases made by engineers. Your medic will keep you from dying, and will provide another target for your enemies to shoot at.
 Pick up enemies' dropped weapons to keep your ammo up. The Heavy's standard mini gun carries 200 ammo, but you can go through 12 ammo in 1 second. This stacks up, so make sure to pick up some ammo boxes.
 Heavies may have 300HP, but those points get used up pretty fast when up against several enemies. A enemy heavy firing at you will do more damage than your medic can heal, so make sure to retreat once in a while.
 It takes a second, and prepares you for the opposition, but it makes you slower than you already are being the slowest class.
, Instead learn how to anticipate enemy attacks (listening to footsteps, enemy weapon sounds and projectile trajectories) and how to jump-spin (simple - just jump in any direction and hit the right mouse button the moment you jump). This will allow you to maximize your limited mobility and allow you to deliver unpleasant surprises to opponents by jumping around corners and opening fire (your mini-gun's loud spinning sound is a sure give-away of an approaching heavy otherwise, and will attract immediate rockets/sticky bombs etc from even average players).

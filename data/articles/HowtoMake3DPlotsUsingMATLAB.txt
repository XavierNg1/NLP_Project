 In the default layout this should appear automatically as the biggest window displayed.;
, Afterwards, select layout and then "Default".



This is typically done in the form of x=and y=Remember to use the dot operator when multiplying or dividing vectors and matrices. Otherwise errors will occur.
 In order to accomplish this, two commands must be used.


The first is the mesh function. By using this, the result will be a wireframe mesh graph.
The other is the surf function. When using surf, the result will be a 3-D surface plot.







The command will be formatted as follows: =meshgrid(x,y).
In the workspace window you will see that the variables xx and yy have been defined.



Use the relationship you know exists between x and y. This is likely to be a function or formula.
e.g., zz=xx.^2-yy.^2


,

From the z components in the matrix "zz", the surf command will create a 3-D shaded surface.
This is the point in which you will relate xx, yy, and zz together.
The actual command line will be in the format of surf(xx,yy,zz) .
, There is a toolbar at the top of the window where the new plot has appeared. This toolbar contains many options and features that can be used to manipulate your 3-D plot.

Some of these options include:

Inserting a label for the x, y, or z axis
Inserting a legend to help readers
Rotating the plot in it's 3-D space
Inserting a light source to show the effects of shadows

, This is done by using the command line shading interp.

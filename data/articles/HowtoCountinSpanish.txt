 Before you can count to higher numbers, you need to learn the Spanish words for zero through nine. These words will form the base or root of many larger numbers.


The Spanish words for 0 through 9 are:0: cero (say-roh)
1: uno (oo-noh)
2: dos (dohs)
3: tres (trehs)
4: cuatro (kwaht-roh)
5: cinco (sink-oh)
6: seis (says)
7: siete (see-yet-ay)
8: ocho (ohch-oh)
9: nueve (noo-ay-veh)


Note that cero stands alone and does not form the base for any other larger number.
Also note that you should only use uno when talking about the number itself. When describing the number of objects, use un for masculine nouns (e.g. "un chico") and una for feminine nouns (e.g. "una chica).
;
, Some of these numbers are derived from their ones' group counterparts, while others are a combination of the term for "ten" and the corresponding one's group term.


The word for 10 is: diez (dee-ays)
The terms for 11 through 15 are derived from their ones' group counterparts:

11: once (ohn-say)
12: doce (doh-say)
13: trece (tray-say)
14: catorce (kah-tor-say)
15: quince (keen-say)


The words for 16 through 19 are combinations of diez (10) and the corresponding ones' place term. Change the z in diez to a c, and link it to the ones' value with the letter i, as follows:

16: dieciséis (dee-ay-see-says)
17: diecisiete (dee-ay-see-see-yet-ay)
18: dieciocho (dee-ay-see-ohch-oh)
19: diecinueve (dee-ay-see-noo-ay-veh)



, The numbers in the 20s group are all formed from linking the term for 20 with the corresponding ones' group word.


The word for 20 is: viente (vee-ehn-tay)
When forming 21 through 29, drop the ending e and change it to an i," as follows:

21: veintiuno (vee-ehn-tee-oo-noh)
22: veintidós (vee-ehn-tee-dohs)
23: veintitrés (vee-ehn-tee-trehs)
24: veinticuatro (vee-ehn-tee-kwaht-roh)
25: veinticinco (vee-ehn-tee-sink-oh)
26: veintiséis (vee-ehn-tee-says)
27: veintisiete (vee-ehn-tee-see-yet-ay)
28: veintiocho (vee-ehn-tee-ohch-oh)
29: veintinueve (vee-ehn-tee-noo-ay-veh)



, The tens' group terms are all derived from the ones' group terms, with some variations. You'll need to know these basic words before you can construct any number from 31 through 99.


The tens' place words for 30 through 90 are:30: treinta (treh-een-tah)
40: cuarenta (kwar-en-tah)
50: cincuenta (sink-kwen-tah)
60: sesenta (seh-sehn-tah)
70: setenta (seh-tehn-tah)
80: ochenta (ohch-ehn-tah)
90: noventa (noh-vehn-tah)



, Unlike the 20s group, you will not alter the root tens' place term when forming numbers from 31 through 99. Instead, you'll separate the tens' group term and the appropriate ones' group term with the Spanish word for “and” — y.Examples of this rule in action include:

31: treinta y uno
42: cuarenta y dos
53: cincuenta y tres
64: sesenta y cuatro
75: setenta y cinco
86: ochenta y seis
97: noventa y siete



, You'll obviously need to know this word when counting from 100 through 199, but you'll also need to use it when forming even larger numbers within the hundreds' group since it forms the base for all other numbers within this group.The Spanish word for 100 is: cien (see-ehn)
Note that you'll only use cien when saying “100” exactly. When using this number to form the base of other numbers, you'll add -to to the end of the root, creating ciento.
 To form the remaining hundreds' place numbers, you'll need to add the corresponding singles' number (or an abbreviated form) to the front of cientos.


The Spanish words for the remaining hundreds' group are:

200: doscientos (dohs-see-ehn-tohs)
300: trescientos (tray-see-ehn-tohs)
400: cuatrocientos (kwat-roh-see-ehn-tohs)
500: quinientos (keen-ee-ehn-tohs)
600: seiscientos (says-see-ehn-tohs)
700: setecientos (seh-teh-see-ehn-tohs)
800: ochocientos (ohch-oh-see-ehn-tohs)
900: novecientos (noh-veh-see-ehn-tohs)


Also note that the terms for 500, 700, and 900 are slightly irregular in form, but the basic rule still applies.
 When you need to say or write a number that falls between the even hundreds' group values, simply follow the appropriate hundreds' group term with the number you need. You do not need to insert y (“and”) in between the hundreds' and tens' place values.


Examples of this principle include:

103: ciento tres
530: quinientos treienta
872: ochocientos setenta y dos



, You'll need to memorize and use this word when counting through all of the thousands' group numbers, from 1000 through 9999.The Spanish term for 1000 is: un mil (oon meel)
For all numbers from 1000 through 1099, you'll need to keep the "un" before "mil."

For example, 1072 would be: un mil setenta y dos


For all numbers from 1100 through 1999, however, you can drop the '"un" before "mil."

For example, 1272 would be: mil doscientos setenta y dos



, To count through the remaining thousands' group, you'll simply need to place the appropriate singles' value term in from of the Spanish term for 1000, mil.


Note that this applies to both thousands, ten-thousands, and hundred-thousands.
The Spanish words for the remaining thousands' group are:

2000: dos mil
3000: tres mil
4000: cuatro mil
5000: cinco mil
6000: seis mil
7000: siete mil
8000: ocho mil
9000: nueve mil


Examples of the Spanish words for the tens-thousands and hundred-thousands group would include:

10000: diez mil
34000: treinta y cuatro mil
800000: ochocientos mil



, When counting numbers between thousands, ten-thousands, or hundred-thousands place settings, write the appropriate thousands' group term followed by the appropriate term for the smaller portion of the number. No irregularities should apply.


Examples would include:

34872: treinta y cuatro mil ochocientos setenta y dos
800103: ochocientos mil ciento tres



, The main words for 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 will form the base words for other numbers in the millions' and billions' group.


The Spanish terms are:

1,000,000: un millón (oon mee-yohn)
1,000,000,000: mil millones (meel mee-yohn-ays)



, All the rules you've learned so far are applicable to numbers within the millions' and billions' groups. You should continue to follow them without exception.


For larger numbers within these groups, precede the term for "million" or "billion" with the appropriate singles' value.
For numbers that fall within the major millions' and billions' place values, write the number as it usually is without any linking term.
Examples include:

4,800,103: cuatro millones ochocientos mil ciento tres
78,800,103: setenta y ocho mil millones ochocientos mil ciento tres

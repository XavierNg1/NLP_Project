 Depending on the cardboard scraps you have, here are some suggested preparation methods (in each case, try to make the resulting circles evenly sized):


If you're using cardboard cut from cardboard tubes/rolls, cut the card pieces down to similar size to form even, shorter circular shapes.
If you're using cardboard strips, cut to even size and roll into circular shapes. Glue or staple into place. Allow to dry before using.
If you're using corrugated cardboard, roll into circles in a spiral fashion (as pictured above). Glue or staple into place and allow to dry before using.
If you're using old cards (for example, Christmas cards), cut the cards into even strips and roll into circular shapes. Glue or staple into place and allow to dry before use.;
, Take the different circles made from the cardboard scraps in the first step and create a wreath circle on a flat surface. Shift the circles around until you're satisfied with the design you've created.
 Taking care to keep the overall shape, glue each circle together until the entire wreath forms. Let dry.
 Tie a bow from ribbon and glue to the top of the string where it has been knotted, to cover the knot.
 Done.

 To celebrate National Cat Day, spoil your cat with fun toys to play with. Visit a pet store and buy toys like puzzle feeders, which you can place treats in for you pet to work out, and which come in a variety of shapes and colors. You can also try to make your own cat toys with household objects such as string, aluminum foil, cardboard boxes, or paper towel rolls., For a fun diversion, give your cat catnip, a herb that causes a moderate "high" in many cats. Purchase catnip at a local pet store in dried, pellet, plant, or spray form. Try inserting a small amount of dried catnip into refillable cat toys, or making your own catnip spray to apply to areas like your cat's bed or scratching post., Cuddling your cat can be a great bonding experience, but it shouldn't be pushed or forced. Be gentle and avoid touching its tail, which cats are often sensitive about. Focus on petting your cat's back and under its chin, and give your cat space if it gives you signs that it has had enough (e.g. swatting away your hand or distancing itself from you).

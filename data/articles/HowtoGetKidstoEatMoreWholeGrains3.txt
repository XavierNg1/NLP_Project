 Unfortunately, food labels can sometimes be deceiving. Foods are often deceitfully labeled as "whole wheat" or "whole grain." Before purchasing a product, scan the ingredients label carefully to make sure it's genuinely whole grain.Often, foods are brown in color and labeled with terms like "multi-grain" or "enriched." Such products may not actually be whole grain. You may find whole grain is not listed close to the top of the ingredients list.
Truly whole grain products will include ingredients with the word "whole" as the first ingredients on the label. You should look for things like whole wheat flour, whole grain corn, and whole grain rice near the top of the ingredients list.
 Each product you buy contains a nutrition label outlining the amount of things like fat, sugar, vitamins, and so on in a product. When selecting whole grain products, pick the items with the lowest content of sugar and sodium. These are healthier than products higher in sugar or salt., One of the reasons whole grains are important to your diet is they help you get fiber. Fiber is necessary to your health and well-being. Select whole grain and whole wheat products that contain plenty of fiber.Any whole grain product you purchase should contain at least 3 grams of fiber per serving.
More is usually better with fiber, however. A product with 5 grams of fiber or more is an excellent source of fiber.
 Whole grain products, like breads and bagels, are often stored in bags. Before bringing a whole grain product home, examine the bag to make sure there are no cracks or tears. This could result in a product that's stale, moldy, or otherwise contaminated.

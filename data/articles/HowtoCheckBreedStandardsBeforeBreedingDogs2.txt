 Breed standards cover just about every aspect of the dog. Breed standards dictate the weight and height of a dog, the shape of the body, temperament, gait, and the coloring.The breed standards vary from breed to breed. Some breed standards include information about the shape of the ears or skull, or even the bite of the dog’s teeth.Breed standards also list characteristics or flaws that will make the dogs disqualified.
 If you have never bred dogs before, you should ask an expert in the breed to help you. The expert can help you fully understand the breed standards and make an informed, unbiased assessment of your dog.You may start by talking to the breeder you got your dog from. You may also look for someone in your area through the breed’s parent organization.
 Before you breed your dog, you need to get it checked out by a vet. This can help you determine if your dog is up to breeding standards before you breed. The vet should conduct various tests to check the status of your dog’s health. Your dog should also have genetic testing done prior to breeding.These tests ensure that your dog has no genetic defects or other health problems that they can pass down to the puppies. Breeding dogs with health problems or genetic defects is irresponsible.

 You will likely need a screwdriver for this step.
 If your skis have a divot going vertically down the underside of them you can use a butter knife to remove any goo.
 Doing this also slowly sands the ski and (if you apply some elbow grease) will make them take on a bit of a sheen.


After you finish scrubbing the skis you can sand them with fine sandpaper if desired.
 For a more natural look use a oil such as linseed oil. If you want a heavier and more protective coating use a varnish or other wood finish.

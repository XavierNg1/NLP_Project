 You can do this according to personal preference or the types of recipes you plan on making. For instance, if you plan to use the kale for smoothies and only need a cup of kale for each one, portion the kale into one-cup (67 g) bunches.


At this point, you can also chop the kale into smaller pieces if you know thatâ€™s how you'll be using the leaves when you thaw them.
 Pack your portioned kale bunches tightly into sealable heavy-duty freezer bags. Press out as much air as possible, and then seal the bags most of the way. To remove the rest of the air, insert a straw into the opening and suck out the air. Then, remove the straw and quickly seal the bag the rest of the way.Air and moisture are two major contributors to freezer burn. Freezing dry kale and removing all the air from the bag will protect the kale from freezer burn.
You can also use a kitchen vacuum sealer if you have one, and this will do a great job of removing the air.
 With a marker, write on each bag the quantity of kale contained within and the date of freezing.This will help you keep track of how old the kale is, tell you when you need to use it by, and remind you what portion size is within each bag.


Labeling is important, because although you know right now how much kale is in each bag, you may forget in 10 months when you go to use it!

, Place the bagged and labeled kale into the freezer for storage. With the blanching, shocking, and proper storage, your kale should keep for up to 12 months.To use the kale, remove the needed portions from the freezer and use them immediately in recipes, or allow them to thaw for an hour before chopping.

 You can perform this action from any computer that you can log into iTunes on.


This method is the only way to deauthorize computers that you no longer have access to.
You can only perform this method once every 12 months., This will be visible in the top-left corner of the iTunes window. If you’re not signed in, this will be a “Sign In” button. Click it to sign in. Once you click your Apple ID, you will be taken to your account settings page.
 Click the “Deauthorize All”. Every computer that was authorized to play your content will be deauthorized., If you want to use the iTunes-protected songs or applications, you will now need to manually re-authorize each computer one by one. Open iTunes on the computer that you want to authorize, click the Store menu, and select “Authorize This Computer”.

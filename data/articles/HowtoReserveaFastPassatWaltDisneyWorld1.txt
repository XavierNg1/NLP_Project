 You can only select three FastPasses to start with, and they have to be in the same park and on the same day. Some parks also have a tiered system, so know ahead of time what you want to use your FastPass options on.


You initially get three FastPass selections in one theme park. If you want more, you'll need to switch into a different Disney Parks theme park to obtain others that day.(Apparently, an attempt by Disney to get you to buy the Park Hopper option onto your theme park tickets). Your choices will reset after the parks completely close off to guests that night, so the next day will start fresh. After you have used your first three fast passes you can book one more in any other park. Once you have used your fourth FastPass you can get another and so on, but this is based on availability.;
, Guests staying in Disney hotels can book FastPasses up to 60 days in advance. However, Non-hotel guests cannot book any of these selections until they get to the kiosk in the park. (Non-hotel guests however can read about how the tier systems work and which rides are paired on which pairs ahead of time on the Walt Disney World system website.)

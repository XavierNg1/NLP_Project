 Welcome your emotions and learn to recognize and accept them. If you try to repress your feelings, you won't control them. They'll control you.Get into the habit of writing through your feelings in a journal. You can analyze what is leading to what feeling, and you can also make a log to keep track of triggers.Suppressing your feelings can give you health problems like sleep deficiency, chronic pain, and heart disease., If you have insecurities, painful memories, or angry responses that come to you frequently, it might help to give them a name. For instance, if you always feel angry when someone cuts you off in traffic, name that feeling "The Got-Cut-Off-In-Traffic-Feeling."When the feeling or thought is triggered, greet it by name. "Oh, it's the got-cut-off-in-traffic-feeling again."
This will help you take some distance and prevent the bad thought from taking over.
 Forgive those who have wronged you. Forgiveness can lead to empathy and compassion for those who have betrayed you. It will make you calm and in control.If you want, contact people you are still in touch with and let them know that you have let go of your anger.
Forgiveness doesn't mean that you condone bad actsâ€”it just means that you release the power they had over you.
 To learn to master your emotions, get a good therapist. Talk through how you feel on a weekly or bimonthly basis. Therapy will help you recognize your emotional patterns, and learn to respond wisely.If you have anger issues, consider taking anger management classes or joining an anger management group.

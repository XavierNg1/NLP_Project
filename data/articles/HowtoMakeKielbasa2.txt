 Place the sausage casings in a bowl of warm water while the meat mixture is freezing. This softens them to make them easier to stuff without ripping.
 Set up the meat grinder in a large, clean work area. Place a clean chilled bowl next to the grinder to catch the ground meat as it comes out of the machine.
 Remove the meat mixture from the freezer. The meat pieces should be frozen on the outside, but still slightly soft in the middle. Feed the mixture into the grinder and grind to a fine texture. When all the meat has been ground, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the freezer. Clean the meat grinder and your work surface, and put the grinder away for later use.


While you are grinding the meat, pay attention to its temperature. If it seems to be warming up, halt the process and return it to the freezer for 15 - 20 minutes before continuing.
Keep your hands cold while you are working with the meat. Run them under cold water when they start to get too warm.
 Remove the meat from the freezer and add 1/2 cup of ice water to the bowl. Use your hands to mix the water with the meat for a little over a minute. This helps the meat bind, which results in a better texture. When you're finished, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the freezer while you get the stuffing equipment ready.

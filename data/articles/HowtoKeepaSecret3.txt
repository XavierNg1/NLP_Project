 If you bring up the topic of the secret in a conversation with someone, you will likely be tempted to tell the secret. You may (consciously or subconsciously) bring up a related topic hoping that you will have the opportunity to tell the secret. Being aware of this can help keep you from doing it subconsciously.
 If you are talking to someone who mentions something related to the secret, you may need to change the topic of conversation.


Continuing to talk about something that reminds you of the secret will put it in the front of your mind and may tempt you to tell.
Try to change the subject casually so that the person does not notice that you are avoiding telling her something.
If necessary, find a reason to leave. Sometimes removing yourself from the conversation is the only way to keep quiet.
 If someone suspects that you know a secret, try to be vague if she asks you about it directly.


You may be able to pretend you don’t know by asking questions about the secret.
 You may need to lie about knowing the secret. If you do lie, be sure you remember what you told the person so you don’t get “caught” in the lie. It’s better to just lie and say you don’t know (even though you do) than to make up an elaborate detailed lie.
 If someone keeps pressing you for information, tell them “I cannot talk to you about this at this time.” Even though you’re admitting that you know something, you are not telling the secret.


If the person is persistent, politely tell them to stop asking you.

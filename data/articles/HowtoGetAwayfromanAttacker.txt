 Periodically look around at everything which is going on. If anyone seems threatening, find safety immediately! Remember, being "aware" doesn't mean glancing behind you while you are walking to your car. It means noticing everyone, everything they could do to you, and everything you could use to defend yourself.;
, Attackers usually choose their targets carefully. Never appear weak or threatened. Keep your head erect, and shoulders back. This might help prevent an attack in the first place.
 Never feel it's impossible that you will ever be attacked. In other words, stay prepared. In being prepared, it will to keep you safe.
 Find the key that you need before approaching your vehicle, Plus, look around, making sure that nothing looks suspicious, like someone watching you.
 But, watch for vehicles that may be passing, and turn to make sure that nobody is behind you. Before you get into your car, quickly check your back-seat out, even though your door was locked.
 Let us say that someone comes up behind you and grabs you. What should you do?


A lot will depend on how tight a grip that the person has on you. If the attacker is behind you, one move would be to slightly bend your arms, bring both arms back, letting your elbows slam in to the attacker's rib cage as hard as you can--don't hesitate!







, If you are weaker than the person attacking you, don't try to stand and fight; the idea is to get out of the situation that you are in. Don't slow down. Once you are free, run.
 They are prepared for your resistance more than anything else. Cooperate until you know for certain that you can get away or attack and be successful, if you have already been kidnapped. If you have not been captured, the best option is to run.
 Manners don't matter when your life is on the line.

 You'll have been working, and you'll deserve it. Every day, buy flowers from Tom Nook's shop. Talk to Tortimer and receive flowers from him. Soon you'll have enough flowers.
 Do this carefully and take your time until it's the way you want. Pick weeds, clovers, items or designs if needed. Also dig things from the ground.
 Go over to your house and water wilting flowers. The next day they should be back to normal. Repeat this step every day. If you accidentally walk on one and kill it, get some more flowers.
 On the Monday it ends, check your letterbox (mailbox). There should be a letter from Tortimer with a present attached. Read the letter and take out the present. The present is a flower trophy. It's special and it's better to earn it, though you can buy it from the catalogue and sell it at the Flea Market. You can read the bulletin board and it will say you won.

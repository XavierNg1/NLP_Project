 Use a hand pump or blow up your balloons manually. Do not use helium because your garland will float in the air., Make the length of yarn a couple of feet longer than how long you want your garland to be. Youâ€™ll also want to cut 4 inches (10.1 cm) pieces of yarn for each balloon you intend to hang. If you run out of these small strips of yarn, cut them as you go., Use a standard knot and tie the 4 inch (10.1 cm) pieces of yarn to the knot on the balloon. Make sure there is close to equal thread on each side of the knot., A square knot is a basic knot that uses two pieces of string. Use the small 4 inch (10.1 cm) pieces of yarn that you tied to the knots on the balloons and tie them to the long strand of yarn that you cut out before., Continue to tie your balloons along the long piece of yarn. Vary the sizes and design of the balloons to make your garland more interesting. Bunch your balloons together and remember to use smaller balloons to add variance to your garland.

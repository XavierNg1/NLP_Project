 Remember to include everything above while aiming for 2-3 pages maximum. This is where being very concise and to the point is important.


If possible, let the letter sit for a few days after you've finished writing it. Come back with a fresh pair of eyes and start revising.
Perhaps ask someone else edit your letter. Ask for honest and constructive criticism, and be prepared to accept it gracefully.
Cut the chaff. Is there anything in your letter that is not absolutely necessary, or doesn't tie well to the other parts? If you can't revise it so that it fits, cut it. Remember that whoever reads your letter has a lot of SoPs to get through, and only has time for the information that matters.
 Be aware that some schools may ask you to submit your letter electronically. If that's the case, convert your letter to a PDF before sending.

 To be a popular girl, you can't be overwhelmed with all the girls asking you questions. You must be able to to answer quickly and snappily, clearly and well. Give off an aura of being in control and always sound like an authority on the relevant subject.
 Be classy, pleasant and smile frequently. Have a bubbly, peppy and outgoing persona. Avoid using words that everyone else overuses––have an excellent grasp of the finer words in the English language.
 You have to have at least one preppy activity. Choose from horseback riding, polo, tennis, squash, track and field or lacrosse. You can also do ballet, jazz, lyrical, tap, cheerleading, basketball, softball, soccer, or volleyball. As long as you do one preppy activity, you can do one non preppy activity.


Join lots of school clubs.
Run for school president or for other officers.
 Get good grades and make good choices. Try to get A's, or a B+ average at the least. The studies come before any extracurriculars.


Speak a language. Consider taking French at school and learning Italian, German, or Spanish in your free time. Learning any other language is good too. Latin helps as well. Take Chinese and ace it.
 Exercise daily. Preppy girls are never unfit. Eat healthily. Drink herbal tea and have plenty of water.
 Decorate the room as you'd like it to be but ensure that it is up-to-date and hip, as well as a cool place to hang out in.

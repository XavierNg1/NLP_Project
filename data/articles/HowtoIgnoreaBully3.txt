 You are worthwhile. Bullies often act out as a way to cope with their own insecurities and stressors. Being bullied often has little to do with you. Focus your time and energy on positive things rather than dwelling on the negative. Consider these ways to cope: Try martial arts. Martial arts is often more about self-confidence than about learning how to fight. Karate, judo, and other forms of martial arts can help you redirect that negative energy.
Join a club or team. Get involved as part of a team. Being part of team can help you feel included rather than excluded. Consider trying out for a sports team, joining an outdoors club, or being part of language club.
Let out your creative side. Find ways to calm your stress. Put your photographs in an art show. Draw. Paint. Sculpt. Make or build something.
 Remember, you don't have to bear this alone. Avoid isolating yourself, as this will likely make you feel worse. Seek guidance from friends and family that you trust.Talk openly about what you're feeling. They care about you.
Family or friends that you trust may have gone through bullying too. Get their support and advice about ways to deal with the situation. They may be able to offer you advice you hadn't considered.
Spend more time with friends and family. It will likely be better to surround yourself with people that care about you even if you're not feeling your best.
 Remember to speak up and get help. If you don't know what to do or feel as if it isn't working, get help. These people may be able to help stop the bullying or provide guidance about what to do next:A teacher
A guidance counselor
A parent, grandparent, or relative
A mentor through a community group
A supervisor or leader at your place of work
The police, if there was a serious injury

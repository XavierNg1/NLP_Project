 When you first start out, concentration will help you do these exercises more effectively. But once you get used to them, you can do several sets in the office, in the car, or at home without others knowing you are performing them., Start out in a comfortable position that helps you maintain good posture, such as sitting upright in a chair or lying on your back. Give yourself a moment to get comfortable before you begin., Contract your pelvic muscles for 3 seconds, then release them for 3 seconds. Repeat this exercise 10 times. Do some Kegels every day, and increase the number of sets you do each day as you grow stronger.Do 1 set for the first few days, then do 2 or 3 sets for the next few days.
After several weeks of doing Kegels, start holding your contractions for 10 seconds each time. Rest for 10 seconds in between. Work up to 3 sets per day, or 3 sets in a row each day.
 Once you can successfully contract your pelvic floor, try doing some quick contractions. Instead of tightening and holding, contract the muscles and release them 10 times in a row. Rest after you have done 10 fast contractions.In the beginning, it will be hard to contract and relax on a rhythm. Pay attention to the contracting strongly and quickly. After a week or 2, it should become easier.
Work up to 3 sets of 10 contractions each day, then, begin doing 3 sets in a row.

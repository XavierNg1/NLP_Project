 StoryCorps is especially interested in recording stories from people with certain valuable perspectives and experiences. StoryCorps' programs and initiatives seek out members of specific populations for their stories.


Examples include the September 11th Initiative (for people whose lives were touched by the day's events), the Griot Initiative (for African Americans), the National Teachers Initiative (for public school teachers), StoryCorps Historias (for Latin Americans), and more.
 For $3,500-$6,000, StoryCorps will travel to your location and record up to six 40-minute sessions per day. These interviews follow the standard StoryCorps interview model. This door-to-door service makes a good choice for corporate events, special gatherings, and more.For booking information, contact customservices@storycorps.org.
 StoryCorps encourages and supports the creation of personal story archives. With the downloadable StoryCorps app, it's easy to use any smartphone or tablet as a microphone to record interviews in the comfort of your own home. The app is available for free from the Google Play Store and iTunes App Store. See our article on using the app for more information.


Stories you record with the app won't be added to the main StoryCorps archive. However, starting your own archive is easy. Visit storycorps.me to get started

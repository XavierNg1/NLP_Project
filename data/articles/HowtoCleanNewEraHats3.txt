 New Era kits are sold with all the basic supplies you'll need to keep your hat looking clean and new. The kits typically retail for about the price of the hat, making them somewhat pricy, but include cleaning spray, shaping spray, a cleaning brush, and a pump-mold that you can use to maintain the shape of the hat when you're not wearing it.The value of these kits is pretty debatable. If you have a big collection of hats you want to keep looking new, it might be worth it, but if you've just got a few, it's probably fine to just use the basic cleaning methods described above.
 The pump-mold can be altered to shape the size of the hat you're wearing. You can set the mold by placing your hat on top of it, and inflating it to the size you want to keep the hat. Squeeze the pressure-ball to inflate the pump. Once you get it to the right size, it'll work on all your hats.
 After you remove the hat, place the hat on the pump-mold and spritz it with a gentle mist of cleaning spray, then gently comb the brim and cap of the hat with the cleaning brush to keep it looking nice.
 After you clean the hat, apply shaping spray while the hat sits. 2-3 pumps of shaping spray is usually enough. This will allow the hat to stay firmly molded and looking fresh for as long as possible.









The cap freshener spray is available for much less money, if you want to opt for the most important part of the package. You can usually get it for abut ten bucks, or try an off-brand cap-cleaning spray for regular up-keep of your caps.

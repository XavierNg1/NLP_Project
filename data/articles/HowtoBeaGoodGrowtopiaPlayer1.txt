 You can do that by typing in a new world name where no one has entered before. You'll see nothing but dirt, lava, rock, and cave background when you make a new one. There will also be no locks so everything can be broken by anyone.
 To mine, select the fist (it's in you're inventory) then tap or click on the block you want to break. You don't have to mine everything in the world. What matters is that you get the seeds of the resources found in the world. It's best to get as much rock seeds as you can because rocks don't drop lots of seeds., You need to splice or mix your seeds to make something new. The reason why is because you need to earn a world lock or any lock you can get. (World lock is the best you can get.) Some good worlds to find recipes are WIKI, RECIPE, and INFO. You may skip this step if you want to try to sell you're seeds as they are but not many people buy those because they can be found in new worlds., You'll be needing lots of those. To mass produce, simply follow the recipe you got and harvest the trees. Then, break your item to get their seeds and plant it again! If the number of seeds you get is decreasing then you could just keep splicing without mining or choose a different recipe., Before you sell, you always have to know the price or people could trick you into selling it for a cheaper price. You can check the price in the Growtopia wiki or BUYMASS. You have to make sure the price is not out of date. You could get fooled., Some good trade worlds are BUYMASS and BUYFARMABLE.   It may be hard because some people don't like new players and call them "noobs". You'll be able to sell it at some point. If you think no one will buy what you made, then switch to another recipe or try other trade worlds., Even though they probably won't remember you, still be polite. Remember that you're talking to a real person and not the game.

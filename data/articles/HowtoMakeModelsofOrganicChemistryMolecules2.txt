 You'll need clay for this. Do it by rolling pieces of clay into balls.
 Make sure they are deep enough for sticks to fit snugly inside, but not too deep.Note that this does not accurately represent the actual geometry of each element's bonding. It only represents how each bonds to another.


For a carbon atom, poke 4 holes each at 90 degrees to each other.
For hydrogen, just poke 1 hole.
For oxygen, poke 2 holes on either side of the ball.
For nitrogen, poke 3 holes each at 120 degrees to each other.
, For bonds, use short wooden sticks such as toothpicks or used matches. Place each stick into an atom and use them to connect your atoms together to make molecules. The image represents a molecule of ethane.

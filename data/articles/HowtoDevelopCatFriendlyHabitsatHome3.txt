 Cats like to feed and drink separately. Therefore, place your cat’s food and water bowls in separate areas of the house.For example, you can place its food bowl in the laundry room and its water bowl in the kitchen.
 Placing multiple water bowls in different locations in your home will encourage your cat to drink more water., Avoid plastic and metal bowls. Plastic bowls give off odors that may deter your cat from eating. On the other hand, the noise created by your cat’s collar clinking against a metal bowl may also deter it from eating., Ideally, each cat should have its own litter box plus one more. Place the litter boxes in secluded corners in your kitchen, bathroom, and/or laundry room. Additionally, make sure to place your cat’s litter box away from its food and water bowls, as well as windows and high-traffic areas in your house.For example, If you have one cat, then place two litter boxes in separate areas of the house. If you have two cats, then place three litter boxes throughout the house.
Make sure to check its litter box at least once, if not twice, a day to remove waste and refill it with fresh litter.
 The scratching posts should be tall enough to allow your cat to fully stretch while scratching. Also use horizontal and vertical scratching posts. This way, your cat will use these instead of your furniture to strengthen its nails and sharpen its claws.If you lack space in your house for scratching posts, then install scratching panels onto your walls for your cat.

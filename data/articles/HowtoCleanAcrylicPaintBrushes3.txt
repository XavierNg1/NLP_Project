 There are several habits that you can get into during painting that make cleaning your brush easier and can protect the bristles from hardening or getting damaged. One of the most important things to remember is to not let paint dry on the bristles.


If you are using multiple brushes when painting and are taking long breaks between each brush, remember to dip the brushes in water occasionally to keep them moist.
Dipping the brushes in water and swirling them around to remove excess paint ensures that the paint won’t dry on the bristles., If you are using multiple brushes, you may be tempted to just leave the brush in water. However, resting your brushes in the water can spread out the bristles and bend them out of shape. The best way to store your brushes while painting is to lay them horizontally on a rag or sheet of paper towel., When you are painting, you may be tempted to dip the bristles of the brush completely in the paint so that the entire head of the brush is submerged. However, doing this will get paint around the ferrule of the brush, making it extremely difficult to clean and eventually damaging and splaying its bristles.Instead of dipping the brush in the paint up to the ferrule, try to dip only up to ¾ of the brush’s bristles in the paint.

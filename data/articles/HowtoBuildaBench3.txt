 Take a single 2x10 and cut two equally sized pieces to the desired height of your bench using a circular saw or a jigsaw.
 Attach a 2x2 cut to 8' length to each side piece. This 2x2 should be attached 1 ½” from the top of the side pieces. Attach these with appropriately long wood screws, 2 for each bar, with the screws at least 1 ½” from the ends of the 2x2.
 Using two 8’ 1x4s, attach the sides of the bench to each other. The top edge of the 1x4 will be flush with the top of the side pieces. Drill dowel holes into both ends of the 2x2s and the matching location on the 1x4s. Use dowels to attach these and then use wood screws, passing from the outside of the bench sides and into the 1x4s, two screws for each end of the 1x4 boards.
 Drop in two 8’ 2x4s. There should be space to have a gap between them. Use long wood screws, going through the side boards and into the seat boards, 6 screws across each side.
 Paint or stain the bench, as needed.

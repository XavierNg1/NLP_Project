 Be prepared to give a little information about your business, even if it's just one or two quick lines. Follow everyone else's lead-see where they put their business cards, if they hand out literature, or give demonstrations or speeches about their business. Joining a smaller club or group will help you gain some confidence and hone the way you promote your company. You can brand out to larger functions once you get comfortable.


Be friendly. Smile at people and introduce yourself, telling each person what you do. You don't have to get into detail at the get-go, but everyone should know what business you represent.;
, You can volunteer with a networking group, a non-profit organization or a community center. Talk about your business with anyone you come into contact with. Break the ice by asking about the other person's interests; explore his needs and see if you can meet them. By volunteering, you will be exposed to quite a few people who might be able to use your services or send business your way.


You can create a rapport with others by joking around as appropriate. This helps lighten the mood.
 Email or call people that you didn't get a chance to meet. You can also get a book listing local businesses from the Chamber of Commerce; consider emailing some of the businesses in this book to see if you can help them in any way, or vice versa.
 Networking doesn't have to be done face-to-face. Sign up for social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, create a profile that gives plenty of relevant information about your business and start finding others who might be able to use your services. A simple keyword search on these sites can help you locate others with similar interests.


Request a meeting with people you have gotten to know online. Perhaps having lunch together will help you explore more opportunities and build a closer business relationship.
 You never know who can help you down the road.

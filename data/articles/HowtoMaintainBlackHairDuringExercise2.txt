 Dry shampoo can be a good option to keep your hair clean and less sweaty after a workout. Apply dry shampoo to the roots of your hair before you head to the gym so your hair is protected. You can get dry shampoo at your local beauty supply store or online.Make sure you hold the dry shampoo canister upside down and shake it for 30 seconds. Then, spray the dry shampoo on your roots about 6 to 10 inches from your hair.
Do not spray the dry shampoo on your scalp or in one spot only. Move the canister around as you spray so the product is evenly dispersed.
Finish by brushing your hair from root to ends to make sure your natural hair oils and the product have mixed together.
 You can also try spraying your hair with a natural oil after you are done exercising to reduce frizz and make your hair smell fresh. Natural oils can also help to add a little more bounce and rejuvenation to your hair.You can try spraying your scalp with a homemade treatment of olive oil, argan oil, or shea butter. You can also buy oil spray for your hair at a beauty supply store or online.

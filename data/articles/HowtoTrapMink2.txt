 The submersion technique is used to humanely drown the mink and prevent the trapper from dispatching the animal. This is the most common way to kill minks in your trap sets. This technique prevents the mink from resurfacing when it tries to escape from the trap.
 A foothold trap makes it unlikely that the mink will escape. Since the foothold trap gives the mink a limited amount of freedom to move, it is ideal for the submersion technique., Place the trap in the appropriate location based on which set you are using.
 Make sure there are no obstacles that would prevent the lock from sliding freely down the wire. Sliding locks prevent the mink from heading back to the bank. Once the mink realizes that it cannot go any further up the bank, it will head towards the deep water. The lock will follow the mink and prevent it from surfacing.
 Make sure the anchor is deep enough to fully submerge the mink. Use a heavy object such as a rock or a stake as an anchor. Embed the anchor into the stream or riverbed so that it is secure and stable. You want it to be heavy enough to prevent the mink from moving the anchor and freeing itself.On average, the stake needs to be 12 to 18 inches underwater.
 Make sure the wire is wrapped tightly around the anchor so it doesn't unravel when the trap is sprung.
 Place the sliding lock onto the wire. Make sure the sliding lock faces the correct direction. You want the lock to slide down the wire towards the deep water.
 Drive the stake into the bank near your set. Make sure the slide wire is tight.

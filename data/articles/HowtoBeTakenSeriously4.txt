 If you really want people to start taking you seriously, first of all you have to act serious. Make sure that you are truly willing to work at it and do your best. Don't constantly joke around and slack off. Instead, act like a responsible adult. Keep a stern face and get to business!


Don't make too many jokes about yourself or use a lot of self deprecating humor. This will make people less inclined to think that you're serious.
 When you talk to someone, say their name, look them in the eye, and make sure they know you are talking to them and you want them to listen. Try to put all your attention into what you are saying or doing so they know that this is important.
 When you make a decision - stick with it. When you decide to do something - do it. When you decide to say something - say it! Give it your all and once you start, make sure to follow through with your action to keep it strong. Be happy with who you are and what you do. If people start pushing your buttons and finding little ways to get you to give in to a decision, they won't always take what you say seriously.
 This of course means accepting responsibility if you do something wrong (instead of blaming it on everyone else), but it also means that you should seek out responsibility. Take on more work, without expectation of reward. Try to find ways to do things better, more efficiently, or find problems that no one else has noticed. This will show your boss and your coworkers that you mean business.

 Unfortunately, grass-fed and organic meats are often more expensive than other meats. If you're on a budget, keep your eye out for a sale at your local supermarket.Be on the lookout in the local paper for sales. You should also check receipts for coupons and save any coupons for meat you receive when checking out.
Keep in mind that organic meats will always be higher in price, even when at discounted prices.
If there's a big sale, stock up on organic meats now and freeze them for use later on.
 In addition to saving you some money, buying directly from a farmer has other benefits. You are able to ask questions about how the animals were raised and whether things like antibiotics were used directly.If you have a local farmer's market, make this your source of organic meat.
You can also look into local farms. Many local farms are willing to sell meat directly to the consumer. If you have a relationship with a local farmer, they may give you a discount.
 You may not always be able to find organic meat in your price range. Strive for alternatives in these situations.If you hunt, or know someone who does, wild game can be a good option.
If health is an issue, you can opt for lean meats or organ meats, which may be more nutrient dense.
If you want to buy organic grass-fed meat for ethical reasons, try making vegetarian meals if you can't find ethically ranged meat.

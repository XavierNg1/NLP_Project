 You should always, always cook insects for at least 5 minutes at high heat to ensure it is safe to eat. Boiling, which evenly cooks the entirety of the insect, is your safest bet., Rinsing the water after 2-3 minutes, then re-boiling once or twice more, will get rid of poor tasting impurities.
 After boiling, preheat the oven and coat the worms lightly in some oil. Add a dash of salt and your favorite spices (pepper, garlic powder, etc.), and toss together so the worms are well coated. Then roast for a few minutes.


When the come out, hit them with a dash of lime, lemon, or soy sauce and heat hot.
 The flavor is mild and the worms are an excellent protein source. Treat them like any other protein source and you'll be surprised how versatile they are.
 To deep fry a worm, boil them and let them cool like normal. Then whip up an egg in a cup (like you were about to make scrambled eggs) Add some salt and pepper, then dunk the worms in the egg wash. Once they're wet, roll them in some basic flour and then fry in 375-degree oil.


After flour, roll again in breadcrumbs for an even crunchier fry.

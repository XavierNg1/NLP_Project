 Fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water and place a glass, heat-safe bowl on top. Make sure that the bottom of the bowl is not touching the surface of the water.;
, Stir the shea butter occasionally to help it melt evenly. Unlike coconut oil, shea butter does not clog pores, making it ideal for sensitive skin or acne-prone skin., You can use just one type of oil, or you can use a combination of two different kinds. Consider using any of the following oils:Apricot seed
Avocado
Jojoba
Sweet almond

, Take the bowl off of the saucepan, cover it with a sheet of plastic wrap, and place it into the fridge. Take it out when the mixture starts to harden and turn translucent, about 10 to 15 minutes. Don't let it harden completely., Choose 2 to 3 different types of essential oil, and add them to the bowl. You need 10 to 15 drops total, so play around with the different proportions. For example, you could have 5 drops of lavender essential oil, 3 drops of carrot seed oil, and 3 drops of Clary sage. Consider any of the following oils listed below:Carrot seed
Clary sage
Frankincense
Lavender
Myrrh
Rosemary

, The cream is ready once it turns thick and creamyâ€”like whipped cream. You can do this using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer. If you don't have a mixer, you can use a food processor fitted with whisk attachments.
 Avoid using plastic, as it tends to leach chemicals overtime. The essential oils in the cream may also degrade the plastic overtime. Use the cream within 6 to 12 months.

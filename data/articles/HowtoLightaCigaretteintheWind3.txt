 Put your unlit cigarette between your lips. Press the end of the lit cigarette up against the end of your unlit cigarette. Without inhaling, take short, rapid puffs from your cigarette as if you are blowing kisses with your lips, or making short sucking motions on a straw.


Try to keep the two cigarette ends flush up against each other so that you ignite the full tip of your cigarette.
Once your cigarette starts smoking, you can take a couple of deep inhales to get your cigarette fully lit on its own.
 If you have an empty paper cup from a beverage, poke a hole in one side of it, for instance with a pen. You can put your cigarette partway through the hole, and light it from inside the cup. That way the cup is protecting all sides of the cigarette from the wind. Make sure that you donâ€™t actually touch the flame to the cup, since paper is flammable.Activate the lighter with your pointer finger instead of your thumb, so that you can point the lighter downwards into the cup without burning yourself.Make a tear or cut in the side of the cup that reaches down to the hole you made so that you can retrieve your cigarette. You can try to pull your cigarette back out through the hole but do so carefully, as glowing ashes may be knocked loose.
 You can purchase lighter cases online that are equipped with windshields. You can also find pocket ashtrays and lighter cases with built-in electric coils to light cigarettes with. That way the wind will not affect the functionality of the heat source.

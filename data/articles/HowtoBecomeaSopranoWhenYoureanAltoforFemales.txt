 Listen carefully as you speak during the course of the first day. When we don't pay good attention to how we use our speaking voices, we usually default to our lower registers. To increase your range upwards, add a "lilt" to you speaking style, or you might mimic the voice of a person younger than yourself, or you could even pretend to yourself that you're in a very happy, giddy mood. Use whatever works to get yourself to speak in overall higher tones.;
, If you know how to do vocal exercises, start creeping up the scale a little every day. However, if you usually just sing regular songs, pick a song that is just a little uncomfortably high for you, and limit yourself to singing it gently and softly about 3 times per day. Remember that voices are made of muscle, and it will take time to teach your muscles a new trick.
 Try not to lose your lower notes completely, but don't practice them too much, as that will strain your already hard-working new muscles.
 That's the lowest voiced sopranos, and a good place to start.

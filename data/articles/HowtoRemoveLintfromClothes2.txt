 They look like an ordinary hairbrush, except that instead of bristles, they have a fuzzy pad instead. The pad feels similar to the soft side of Velcro. Simply rub the lint brush in a single direction across the fabric. Start from the top of the garment, and work your way downward. If there is any lint leftover when you reach the bottom hem, you can pull it off using a lint roller or a piece of tape.
 The dryer sheet will also get rid of static, which attracts lint in the first place.
 Put on a rubber glove, like the one you would use to wash dishes. Run your hand downward across the fabric towards the hem. The lint and pet hairs will stick to the glove. As you continue to rub the fabric down, the lint and pet hairs will gather in one place. You can wipe them off using the glove, or you can pick them off with a piece of tape or a lint roller.
 Stick your hand into a nylon sock or a pair of pantyhose, like you are putting on a glove. Make sure that your fingers are touching the toe part. Run your hand lightly across the fabric. The lint will stick to the nylon and pantyhose.
 If you take your clothes out of the washer and see that there is lint on them, put them back in and wash them again. Do not use detergent for this second wash. After the cycle is done, take the clothes out, and shake them out to loosen any leftover lint. Dry the clothes in the dryer as you normally would.

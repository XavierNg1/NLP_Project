 A healthy appearance is very attractive,so by looking fresh, you’ll look your best. Do your normal hygienic routine like brushing your teeth or taking a shower before taking your photo.


Exfoliate and moisturize your face and body to give you a nice smooth glow. Take the extra step to floss. This removes plaque and will give you a brighter smile.;
, Style your hair in a way that best frames your face or use quality make up to highlight your features. Think about what you do to look great on a first date or to an important interview and do exactly that. If you love your look, you’ll be more comfortable in front of the camera.


If you have the money and time, go to a stylist and have them give you a make over before you take your picture. Ask them to teach you how to do it home, so if you want to take more pictures you can do it yourself.
 Wear something that flatters your figure and makes you stand out in a crowd. Bold colors will put the focus on you, whether your background be a clear sky or a busy street. Use an accessory to make you dazzle, but does not draw attention away from your face.


Make sure there are no unsightly stains or tears in inappropriate places.

 To do this, go to http://www.animaljam.com/signin and select the 'Create An Animal'. Enter in your username, birth date, email address, age, password, gender, and don't forget to agree to the terms and conditions. Then make your account. You will see a bunny named Peck. Follow her and do what she says. Your username will appear to be "new jammer" because AJHQ is reviewing it.;
, Busy ones are great, but you may not get a spot in Jamaa Township (Animal Jam's main area) and may be sent to another area because Jamaa Township is full. Jamaa Township is where people trade and host fashion shows, hotels, restaurants, salons, parties, etc. Try and host some!

, Explore Jamaa Township (where you will probably end up) and go to Jam Mart Clothing to buy clothes. There are also several shops around Jamaa that sell clothes. Check the shops every Monday for a rare item! Don't buy too much as you will need a bit of money for the next step.

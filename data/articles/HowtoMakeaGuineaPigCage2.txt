 A guinea pig run is a more specialized structure for outdoor exercise, letting your animal roam about without the risk of it getting lost or escaping. It is basically a large mesh cage without a bottom, which you can place directly on the grass. Runs can be fairly large – four feet on each side and one foot in height are fairly typical dimensions. You can build yours as a separate structure, but it is also possible to incorporate it into an existing hutch. In fact, the structure will be a lot like the hutch in its design. In its most basic form the run is a wooden frame with wire mesh sides. Sketch out a blueprint and all of your planned measurements before getting started., As with the hutch, you will need wood, screws, wire mesh, wood staples, a drill, and a saw. However, runs are designed to be lightweight, at least those that are portable, so that the wood will ideally be lighter and rather less solid than that used in the hutch.Like hutches, guinea pig runs can be found online or at some pet stores for between $50 and $100. Instructions will walk you through the assembly process.
 As with the hutch, again, start by measuring and cutting the frame. The run is slightly more simple in that you really only need to construct a simple frame. There does not need to be a roof, floor, or even a door. Measure the wood per your blueprint specifications, double check the measurements, and make your cuts. Then, with the drill, drill your attachment holes and assemble the pieces., Cut the wire mesh once you have finished the frame. The mesh will need to cover each side of the run frame, at the least, and be secured with wood staples. You can also put mesh over the top of the run, though this is not strictly necessary. Guinea pigs like to jump (called “popcorning”), but there should be little danger of them escaping if you have made the run at least one foot high.

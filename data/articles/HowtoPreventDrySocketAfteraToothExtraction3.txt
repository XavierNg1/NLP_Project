 However, if you feel increased pain two days after the surgery in addition to other dry socket symptoms, your socket is probably dry. Usually, a dry socket heals itself after five days and the pain disappears. All you have to do is maintain good hygiene and avoid getting food stuck in the extraction site. Look for these issues to determine if you might have a dry socket:


Exposed bone. Look into your mouth at the surgical wound. If you don't see a scab, and you do see exposed bone, you have a dry socket.
Bad breath. A bad smell coming from your mouth could be an indication that the wound isn't healing properly.
 A dry socket must be treated by your dentist or surgeon to make sure it properly heals.The dentist will dress the wound with a salve and gauze to promote cell generation in the area. You may be given an extra painkiller prescription to deal with the increased pain, which can radiate from your mouth up to your ears.


Carefully follow the dentist's instructions for caring for a dry socket. Don't smoke, eat chewy foods, or otherwise exacerbate the situation.
You may be asked to return every day to have your dressing changed.
Eventually new tissue will form over the socket, covering the bone and the exposed wound which contains nerves and vessels. It may take a month or longer to fully heal.

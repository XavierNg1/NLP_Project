 You should do this approximately 1 or 2 days before the actual day of transplanting in order to let the fertilizer do its work.;
, You should use enough potting soil to reach approximately 2 inches (5.1Â cm) below the rim of the pot.
 Make sure that there are absolutely no dry soil areas in your destination pot.
, Grab the base of the plant with a flat hand, make sure to cover as much of the topsoil as possible. Flip the pot upside down and carefully pull the plant out with the soil. Don't move too quickly or else you may damage the roots in the process.
 Use a little bit of extra soil to fill in any holes and make sure that none of the roots are exposed. Lightly water the pot with the water-fertilizer mixture from before.
 It will take a day or 2 for the plant to adjust to its new soil environment, and only then should you bring it back into a full-light environment.

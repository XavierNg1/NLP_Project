 You can buy gas cartridges that produce carbon monoxide and other lethal gasses.









Locate all of a burrow's entrances. Block off all but the main one using a rock or a chunk of sod.
Light the cartridge, following manufacturer's instructions, and throw it into the burrow's main entrance. Block off the main entrance to the burrow to prevent the groundhogs from escaping.










The repellent will give the plants a bitter taste that woodchucks dislike.
Continue to spray the plants as they grow and after it rains.

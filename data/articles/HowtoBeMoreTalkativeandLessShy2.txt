 Build up your skills by having small interactions with people. Taking small steps will increase your confidence in your abilities. Because the interactions are small, it is not a big deal if they end up being awkward.Smile at a person on the street.
Start a conversation with a cashier, waitress, salesperson, delivery person, or the mailman.
Give someone a genuine compliment.
Ask someone an informal question. If you were in a checkout line, you may say, "Have you been really busy today?"

, Stay up-to-date on current events such news, sports, entertainment, and television. This will allow you to participate in any conversation that you find yourself in. You do not need in-depth knowledge about all topics, just enough to be able to comment and give an opinion.Choose a few news or popular culture websites that you can skim daily to stay up-to-date.
You can also read the newspaper or watch the news once a day to keep up.
 When someone else is speaking, they will give clues about other topics you can discuss. If you listen, you can identify different ways to move the conversation forward.For example, if someone says, "Yesterday, I went out to eat with Michael." Based on that sentence, you could ask about the restaurant, other activities for the day, and Michael.
You could also connect any of those answers to your personal experiences. You could discuss any restaurants that you have been to or any new ones that you would like to try.
 Make good eye contact and stand up straight. Speak confidently: project your voice so that the person can hear you, don't speak too quickly, and speak with a friendly, outgoing tone. These small tips can help others better understand you, but it also can help you feel more accomplished and heard socially.
 Being a good conversationalist is a skill that can be developed. The more you practice, the better you will get. You will be less nervous in social situations, and being talkative will feel more natural.

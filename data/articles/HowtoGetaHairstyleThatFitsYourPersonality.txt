 Try on a uniform or casual outfit of the type that you'd wear, and cover the collar with a towel if you're using a pomade, streaking dye or gel.;
, Hair can be a useful canvas uncut but if you want it shorter or longer you might want to try a cut a few months in advance of the actual school opening date to see how you like it.
 Clean hair (But not too clean, maybe washed yesterday evening is good) is an obvious necessity, and any other basic styling products (Gel, mousse, hair lotion or conditioner) are good, plus any accessories you might choose to wear.
 Pull back long hair if you want it styled like that, or dampen a hairbrush and run it through your hair to tame frizzes. A straight part is good for clear skin but it draws attention to your nose and lips, which might not be good on a day where you have a massive zit, for instance. Choose your part according to your face shape, and you can find more about that elsewhere.
 Long, straight hair may need extra maintenance or more shower time, and short hair is, though less work, often a hassle if you want to dress up.
 Dye jobs should be done at a salon, and curling irons ought to be used with care- if at all.
 Your hair says a lot about you, for good or for ill. Long, straight black hair on a normally pale, fair person may give people the impression that you're Goth or depressed, but bottle blonde waves on a small, normal-looking girl looks totally fake. African-American girls can style their hair the same way, with no problems, but very light colored, straight hair may send a message that you're trying to look too preppy. Short haircuts like a bob are often perceived as little-girly, but shorter, more masculine cuts may make people think of you as a tomboy, and that you don't like to comb all your hair!

, Remember- 10 minutes or less is good for hairstyling, if you're taking more- you'll be late for school, work or wherever you're headed.

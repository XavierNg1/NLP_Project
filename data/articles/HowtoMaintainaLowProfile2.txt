 All social media networks have privacy controls. When you adjust these settings, you have control over who has access to your information (e.g. profile, pictures, posts, data). Sites regularly change their privacy policies so stay up-to-date.Facebook allows your friends to share information about you. Be sure to go into your privacy settings and set limits.
The default for privacy settings is completely open and accessible profiles.
 Only be friends with people that you actually know. Reject any requests from complete strangers. You should also go through your friend list every few months to see who you are sharing your information with.


The more friends you have, the more people will know about you and what you are doing.
 Remember that anything that you post is public information and is permanent. Even if you delete a post or a picture, they can still be found. If you do not want the information revealed on a billboard, it is best not to post.


Remember that employers often check social media during the hiring process.
Never share personal details or your current location.
 Use different usernames and logins for each of your accounts. This way it will be harder to track your online activity. You can also use an avatar or some other picture instead of using your actual picture for an online profile.You can also block your IP address so that you cannot be tracked when you are using the internet.

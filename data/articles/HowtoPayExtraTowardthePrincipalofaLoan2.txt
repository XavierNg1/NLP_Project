 If you're unsure you want to renegotiate the terms of your payment plan, you can simply work on increasing your monthly payments each month. Each month when you write your checks for the loan, increase the amount you're paying by one twelfth. While it might not seem like a lot, you are slowly chipping away at the principal of the loan., Many people are nervous about committing to a payment plan with strict, set amounts. One way simple way to pay extra towards the principal of a loan is to simply pay more each month when you can. If you have extra money one month, put it towards your loan. If you're low on funds the next month, just pay the regular amount., Some people enjoy the flexibility of simply paying more, but it comes with certain drawbacks. Understand the pros and cons when considering a flexible payment plan.


You have to take initiative on your own if you're simply paying more. When you agree to a new payment system, you're essentially to pay more. However, going at it alone means you have to take personal responsibility. If you're not great at financing and budgeting on your own, you might want to reconsider simply paying more.
The main plus side on a flexible payment plan is that you're under no obligation to make higher payments if you can't afford to do so. If you're financial situation is somewhat unstable, this might be a good idea.
Keep in mind that, for most payment plans, paying extra one month does not mean you will not owe your regular payment the next month.

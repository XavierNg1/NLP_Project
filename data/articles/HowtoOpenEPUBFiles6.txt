 You can convert your EPUB file to several different file types, including PDF (which can be read on virtually any device). If you want the EPUB file to be readable on any device without having to install extra software (in most cases), convert it to a PDF.


If you have several EPUB files, you may want to move them all to the same folder to make it simple to convert multiple files.

 If you only need to convert one file, you can use a reputable EPUB conversion site like EPUB Converter. You can access a conversion site on both mobile and desktop devices.

There are many options for converting an EPUB file to another format. Be careful when trying alternatives, as not all sites are trustworthy.

 Always treat a gun as though it were loaded, even if you know it isn't.
 This will usually be on the right side of the gun, where the barrel meets the stock.


Unlike a pump-action shotgun, a break action has no magazine tube to load several shells at a time into. Instead, the gun breaks open to allow you to load a shell directly into the chamber of your barrel (or barrels). This means your gun needs to be reloaded after every shot, or every two shots if you have a double-barreled shotgun.
, Be careful: these may be hot if the gun was recently fired. Try not to let your hand touch the metal of the barrel.
 The business-end of the shell should slide into the barrel.
 Your gun is now loaded and ready to fire.

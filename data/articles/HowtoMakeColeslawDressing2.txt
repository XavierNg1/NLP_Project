 Whisk together the low-fat yogurt, Dijon mustard, water, low-fat mayonnaise, and lemon juice in a large bowl until well combined.


The coloring should be even throughout, with no visible streaks of mustard.
The consistency should also be even.
 Taste test the dressing using a clean spoon. If it tastes bland, you could add salt and pepper according to your own preferences.


You could also add about 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) dill seeds as well, for additional dimension.
This recipe has a lot of liquid ingredients, so you should proceed with caution when adjusting the amounts to avoid creating a runny dressing.
 Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve.


Fold your coleslaw mix into the dressing, thoroughly coating all the vegetables with dressing.

 Instead of letting a failure get you down for weeks, think about what you learned from it. Remind yourself that no one is successful all the time, and setbacks are a necessary part of making progress in life.Maintain a positive mindset by developing a list of affirmations to repeat whenever you start to doubt yourself. These might include sayings like "I can do anything I put my mind to" or "Everyone was once a beginner."

, Wallowing in negative emotions will only make it harder for you to move past a setback. Even if a setback was completely your fault, don’t dwell on it or beat yourself up. Instead, make a plan for how you’ll do better next time. Then move on.For instance, if you failed a difficult college class, you might resolve to improve your study habits and then re-take the class.
Another method for self-forgiveness is talking about it. Many times when you feel guilty about something, you keep the misdeed to yourself, where it only grows larger and more negative in your head. Tell someone you trust what you did and be willing to receive their support., The best way to get over a setback is to start making progress again. Think of some small, actionable steps you can take to get back on track. Then put them into practice.For instance, if you lost your job, you could start moving forward again by making a list of other jobs you want to apply for.

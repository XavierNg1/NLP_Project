 Losing weight is the prime way to thinner hands, and the healthiest way to lose weight is through exercise. The CDC recommends adults get roughly 150 minutes of aerobic activity and strength train at least twice a week.If you’re already exercising that much, try to up your routine.


Contrary to popular belief, hand exercises will not lead to slimmer hands. First, “spot training” where a person targets a certain area of their body for exercise and weight loss is largely a myth. Second, even if exercising certain muscles for weight loss were possible, your fingers don’t have any! The muscles controlling your fingers reside in your palms and forearms.;
, The other safe, effective method of weight loss is through eating well. Eat fresh fruits and vegetables, especially green leafy ones like lettuce and kale. Lean meats, such as chicken breast and a variety of fish, are also an important part of a healthy diet. Just be sure to watch those calories and avoid large amounts of processed sugar by steering clear of simple carbohydrates and candy. Don’t skip meals, as this has the potential to cause major health problems., “Chubby” hands may actually be swollen ones. Swelling can be caused by water retention, which may be due to mild dehydration.Sometimes that type of hand swelling can be caused by drinking too much water, causing an imbalance of electrolytes in your body.If your hands swell after exercising for at least an hour, try drinking a sports drink instead of water.
If proper hydration doesn’t improve swollen hands or if it is accompanied by vomiting and confusion, see a doctor. Swelling in the hands and other extremities can be a sign of serious medical problems., Eating too much salt can cause fluid retention, making your hands swell. Avoid foods like salted peanuts, potato chips, processed meats, and soy sauce. If you’re having trouble cutting those out of your diet, buy low sodium versions available at most supermarkets.

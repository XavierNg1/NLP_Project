 If you're using used candlesticks, give them a quick clean. Wooden ones can be wiped down with a damp cloth, while metallic ones can be washed fully in dishwater with gentle detergent. Allow to dry completely before proceeding.;
, Place a square of brown paper/flat paper bag or a paper bowl directly under the spot you're going to be working on, to catch loose glitter for reuse. A lot of glitter will fall off when making this project and it's worth rescuing.
 Paint a small section of glue at the base of the first candlestick. This prevents the glue from drying before you can get glitter onto it.


Sections of about 2.5-5cm/1-2 inches are about enough to cover in one go.
 If you are, move on to the next step. If not, apply a new coat of glue or Mod Podge and add more glitter. Allow to dry before moving on.
 Cover completely. As with the previous step, check that you're happy with the amount of glitter applied. Let dry before moving to the next step.
 Sprinkle the glitter over the painted section to cover completely. Add another layer of glue/Mod Podge and glitter each time, if needed.
 However, do not place any glitter or Mod Podge on the dish part/upper side where the candle sits––no need to tempt flammability. Instead, finish up underneath the holder lip. Let dry at least 24 hours before using.
 This will seal the glitter in place.

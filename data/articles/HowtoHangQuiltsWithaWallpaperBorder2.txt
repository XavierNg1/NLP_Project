 You may need to make the pieces shorter or longer depending on the size of your quilt, however.
 Place the corner of the strip 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) down and 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) over.
 Even though the self-adhesive Velcro should stay on the quilt by itself, a quick stitch will give it extra support.
 The strips should be on the inside of the wallpaper frame, about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) in and 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) down to match the location of the strips on the quilt.
 The Velcro pieces should be evenly aligned, and the quilt should fit perfectly inside the wallpaper border.

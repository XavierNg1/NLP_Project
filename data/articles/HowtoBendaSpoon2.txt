 This technique can look good on camera, but you won’t fool a live audience, particularly not up close. It could conceivably work live if done at a distance, but as there is no simple way to produce an unbroken spoon, it would be difficult to end well., If you have a hacksaw you can use it to cut the bowl of the spoon off the handle. If not, manually bending the spoon back and forth a few times should do the trick just as well. Sand down any sharp edges when you are done.
 You hand should be positioned almost like you are making the hand signal for “okay,” but with your middle, ring, and little fingers relaxed instead of extended. Grip the two parts of the spoon in such a way that it creates the illusion you are holding a whole spoon., Both sides of the spoon will droop downward, creating the illusion that it is bending. Make sure not to loosen your grip so much that you drop part of the spoon.

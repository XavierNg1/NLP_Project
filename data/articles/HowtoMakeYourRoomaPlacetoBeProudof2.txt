 Usually the most unorganized place in the room is the closet. Take everything out, try it on if you're not sure it will fit, and put everything away in an organized fashion. Donate anything that doesn't fit or you don't wear anymore.
 All the shelves, drawers, everything. Take everything out, throw out old papers, donate or sell old books. Then put everything back. Make sure you know what's in each drawer, if you want you could label them.
 If you don't have one, you can skip this part. Do the same thing you did for the closet- take everything out, try on as necessary, and put everything away.
 Just organize them in a way that makes sense to you-everybody has a different way that works for them.

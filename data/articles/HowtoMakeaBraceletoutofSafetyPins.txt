 Decide how large you want the safety pins to be––obviously, the larger the pins, the larger the bracelet size. Small to medium size safety pins work best; whatever you choose, they must all be of the same size. Approximately 85 safety pins are needed to complete this project but you might need to add or remove a few depending on your wrist size––experiment as you go.









As well as the safety pins, select seed beads that are of a size suitable to fit inside the pin space. The colors are up to you––they could be all one color, a variation of the same hue or a rainbow of colors, depending on the final look you're after.;
, Open each pin and place a row of seed beads onto each safety pin. Make sure each pin has enough beads on it before closing.
 Use pliers to press down on the head of the safety pin to hold the pin firmly closed.
 Squeeze the metal where you locked the pins in place.
 Once they're all decorated and closed tightly, you can move on to threading.
 These holes will be used for threading up the pins.
 Two lines will be used, one at the top and below, with the pins threaded onto the elastic lines like the rungs of a ladder.
 To begin, thread the top line through the head of the first pin and the bottom line and through the circle hole. With the second pin, thread the top line through the circle hole and the bottom line and through the head of the pin.
 Make sure when you add the safety pins that all the beads are visible on the same side.
 When the last safety pin has been added, tie the two ends of the top line of sheering elastic together so that all the pins sit closely together. Then tie off the bottom line in a similar way. Make sure the knots are tight and stable.
 Stretch the elastic gently and slip over your hand and onto your wrist. The fit should be comfortable.

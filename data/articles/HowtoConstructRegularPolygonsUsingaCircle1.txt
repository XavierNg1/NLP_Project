 This will be the center line of your circle (dividing it into hemispheres).;
,,,,, Since a circle has 360°, divide 360° by n, the number of vertices (or sides) to get α.


α=360°/n
α is the measured angle between lines drawn from the center of the circle to adjacent vertices.
For a dodecagon, n=12. A dodecagon has 12 sides and 12 vertices, so 360° divided by 12 comes out to be 30° and α=30°.
 Using the protractor, mark all the multiples of the angle α calculated above.
 For a dodecagon there should be 12 marks and 12 sides because it has 12 vertices. Don’t overlap the line segments.


If your points are outside of the circle, then simply mark another point along the radial line from the center onto the circle for each point and then join them.
 If they are, you can rub out the circumscribed circle.

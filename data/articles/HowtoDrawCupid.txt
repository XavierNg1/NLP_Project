 Cupid is a fairly rotund character, so try to make your head as circular as possible.;
, This will serve as the body.
 Each should end with a circle for the hand (follow the illustration to make the position for the sketched hands).
 Finish these with horizontal ovals (again, follow the illustration).


At this point everything should still be in circles and ovals--be patient, soon your cupid will begin to take shape.
 Outline the face to make it chubby and add big eyes, a small nose, and a smiling mouth. Draw short hair curling around the edges of his face.
 Draw a chubby body over the sketch. Add a bow in the left hand and a heart-shaped arrow in the right hand. Make a small wing with pointy feathers on the back.
 Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. This will make your drawing look better and more professional.
 Try to use light, Valentine-y colors; look at the illustration for reference.


Use light colors.

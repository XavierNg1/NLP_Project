 Bohemian style maxi skirts, in white, brown, or patterned, work especially well when matched with a clean, non-distressed denim shirt. Since these skirts tend to by loose-flowing, they generally work best with fitted denim shirts or loose denim shirts that are belted around the waist to create form.
 Girly floral skirts or lace skirts are another way to play off the casual, boyish look of denim to create a surprisingly feminine look. You can either wear these textures and prints on loose-flowing maxi skirts, or you could wear them as tighter-fitting mini skirts and knee-length skirts. You could even try a ruffled skirt, if it flatters your body shape. To create a more noticeable feminine edge, leave a light-wash button denim shirt open and wear a soft white or plain pastel beneath it.
 For a fall, winter, or early spring look, match a pencil skirt made from heavy material with a denim shirt, leggings, and fashion boots. If the shirt is loose, tuck it in to create more form; otherwise, you can leave it hanging out. The skirt can look casual, like a cargo khaki skirt, or it can be a little dressier, like a wool or twill skirt. For a chic twist, throw a colored or patterned blazer over your shirt or tie a fashion scarf around your neck.
 In this instance, you want your footwear to match the style of your skirt rather than the style of the denim. If you have on a loose Bohemian skirt, flats or sandals may work best. For more fitted skirt styles, though, you might want to try fashion boots or closed-toe heels. If you are trying to play up your feminine side, a strappy kitten heel might give your look the boost it needs.

 “WP” stands for Waypoint. The “WP” button is at the bottom left corner of your screen, and it has a symbol of a flag. When you tap the “WP” button, the “Add Waypoint” page will open where you will be required to enter a WP comment. A WP comment is a statement you write to show that you were in a certain place, like saying “I was here!” When you tap the “WP” button, a text box will appear on the top of your page. Type in the WP comment you want here.
 The add photo icon is on the bottom left side of the application. Tap the icon to add photos of the location you passed through. This is the best way to share or blog your location to friends and family.
 Tap the active map icon at the bottom left corner of the screen of your iPhone. An Active Map page will open showing you the map of your current location.


You can change view modes (Satellite, Hybrid, Map) in Active Map by selecting the option at the top right corner of the screen.
 Adding a waypoint to track where you are (or have been) is the best way to track your progress. Click the flag WP icon on the left side of your screen and add the location where you took your run in the box. Continue adding locations until the end point of your run. When you’re done, tap “Save.”


The app will then provide the direction and distance the you have run by picking the start point to the end point.

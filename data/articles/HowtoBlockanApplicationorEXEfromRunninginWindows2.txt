 If you are not using a Professional version of Windows, you can block applications from running using the registry hack technique. Please remember that a serious problem can occur if you do it incorrectly, so it is always advisable to back up your data prior to applying a registry hack.
 You can type Win+R combination on your keyboard to open regedit.exe and then type in the key given below:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer

, Do this in the right pane on the screen with the value being set at 1.
 Do this on the left pane, under the Explorer key.


In case these keys do not exist, all you will have to do is right-click and create the keys that you want.
 Do this on the right pane, just below the DisallowRun key.


Continuing in numerical order (so 1 will be followed by 2 and then 3 and so forth).
For example, if you want to block applications like Firefox and iTunes from running, you would need to add the keys like this:
1 Firefox.exe
2 itunes.exe

, The change will be in immediate effect when you try to run the application.


You will see a popup that is likely to say “This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect in this computer. Please contact your system administrator.”

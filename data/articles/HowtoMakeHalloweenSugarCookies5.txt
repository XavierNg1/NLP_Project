 Grease a cookie tray with non-stick greasing spray., In a large bowl cream the butter and sugar with an electric or hand blender until the mixture is light and fluffy., Blend until well-combined and there are no more egg streaks., Blend on low speed for about two minutes until the cookie dough starts to form.

If the cookie dough is too dry, add 1-2 tablespoons of milk.
 Using your hands, roll the cookie dough into a large ball or roll it into two medium-sized balls. Place the cookie dough in a separate bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Place it in the fridge to chill for about an hour., Remove the cookie dough from the fridge. Flatten the cookie dough ball by pressing your hands on it. Use a rolling pin to roll it out into a large rectangular shape., Gently press the cookie cutter on the dough to cut each cookie., Leave a two inch space between each cookie to avoid them from binding together when they bake., Place the cookie tray in the oven. Have the cookies bake for about 8-10 minutes, until the edges are golden brown., Remove the cookie tray from the oven. Lay the cookies on a wire rack by removing them with a spatula. Have the cookies cool for about ten minutes., Using a butter knife, spread black frosting over the sugar cookies. Smooth out the frosting by gently smothering the butter knife around. Cut a small piece of grey fondant and form it into a line to make the 'mouth'. Pipe two triangles near the mouth to make the 'teeth'. Pipe the eyes near the top with the white frosting. Make the 'wings' more realistic by rolling small pieces of the grey fondant and adding it on the wings., Enjoy!

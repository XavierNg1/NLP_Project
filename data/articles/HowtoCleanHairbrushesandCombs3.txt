 When cleaning the bristles of your brushes, go slowly and make gentle motions. Cleaning the bristles too aggressively could result in them bending or breaking during the cleaning process.
 Brushes that have cushioning below the handles should not be wet for long periods. Avoid soaking these brushes to disinfect them and stick to only giving them a mild rub down with a mild cleaner and water., Brushes with wooden handles or frames should never be soaked. Wood is very susceptible to water damage and soaking a wooden brush can easily ruin it. Stick to washing these brushes with a toothbrush and cleaner.

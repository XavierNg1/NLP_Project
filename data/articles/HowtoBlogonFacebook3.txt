 Several developers have designed apps that will allow your blog entries to post automatically to Facebook at the time of their publication.


Go to the search bar at the top of your open Facebook session.
Type in keywords such as "blog feed" or "link to blog" to locate a number of different apps related to blogging and Facebook. Examples of apps you can use are "Social RSS," "RSS Graffiti," and "NetworkedBlogs."

, When adding a third-party app to your Facebook profile, you must review the terms and conditions set in place by the developer of that particular app.


Click on "Go to App" to the right of any app you want integrated with your Facebook profile.
Read the "About this App" or "Request for Permission" sections. In most cases, you will be presented with a list of information the app will have access to from your personal profile once the app has been officially added to your profile.
Click on the "Allow" button to finish adding the app to your Facebook profile.
 Depending on the app you add, you may be prompted for information about your blog so Facebook can update your friends with links to your published blog content.


Enter the web address for your blog and other information as requested by the app. You will then have your blog content posted to Facebook automatically whenever you write new content.

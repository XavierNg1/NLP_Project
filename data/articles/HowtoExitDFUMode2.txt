 Since iTunes must be open and your phone must be connected to your computer in order for your phone to be in DFU mode, you simply need to click the iTunes window to bring it to the foreground in order to begin.
 It's on the right side of the iTunes window. If your iPhone is in DFU mode, you shouldn't be able to access any of your music or apps--you'll simply have the iPhone window open., Doing so will erase all data on your iPhone and install the latest version of iOS. This process will take several minutes.
 Once it finishes updating, you'll have the option to restore your most recent backup, which will restore your contacts, messages, photos, and any other data present in the backup.

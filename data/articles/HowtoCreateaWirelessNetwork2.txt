,, If your operating system does not recognise the wireless adapter, get drivers from any discs that came with the adapter. Or, failing that, download them from the Internet.
 In Windows XP, either right click on the .inf file and click install, or enter Device Manager and Update Drivers on the Unknown Device.


Once Windows XP recognizes your wireless device it should appear in Network Connections and offer you a choice of routers to connect to within range.

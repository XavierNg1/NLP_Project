 If you are not sure about whether you really want to stop, you probably won't. But, if you genuinely feel and think you are ready, then go to step 2.;
, For example, if you want to quit smoking, your list might be: i. I will smell better, ii. I will have more money, iii. I will feel more energetic and healthy, iv. I will know I have overcome something that was harming me, v. My mood will get better. etc. If you want to stop gambling, your list may be: i. I will have more money. ii. I will stop feeling guilty after losing money. iii. My relationships with my friends and family will improve. iv. I will feel powerful for overcoming this affliction.
 For example, if you want to quit smoking so that you will NOT smell bad, rewrite your list to say "I want to quit smoking so that I will smell fresh and clean". Or if you said you want to quit drinking because you DON'T LIKE feeling depressed and hung over all the time, rewrite this to say that you will feel much more energetic, peaceful, and healthy. Write your reasons for giving up the addiction in how you will feel, not how you won't feel.
 Take a few deep breaths and relax. Listen to the sounds around you and let yourself feel however you feel for a few moments. Don't be too hard on yourself. Begin to visualize a "peaceful place". This is a nice, calm, peaceful place such as on the beach or on a warm calm hillside with the winds in your face and the soft ocean sounds all around. Pick the spot that is right for you. Just keep visualizing that peaceful place, and really allow yourself to go into it fully. Use all your senses to go into it as deeply as you can. You may feel the soft sand under your legs, or the warm smell of the fresh air outside. The soft sun rays may warm your skin and make you feel safe and secure. Go deeply into your peaceful place.
 I am feeling peaceful and relaxed, and I smell fresh and good. Here I am in this peaceful place, free from my addiction to cigarettes, and I am happy because I have so much more money to spend on my family and my future. Here I am, in this peaceful place, and I am enjoying all the energy and balance since quitting smoking." And so on down your list. "Here I am in my peaceful place, and I am free of my dependency on ____________ (insert addiction), and I am feeling so good because ____________________ (insert item from your list)."

, You can do this many times, if you like. Perhaps every evening before bed.

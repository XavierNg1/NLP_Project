 If you only need to correct a few cells, you can fix them one at a time. Edit each cell to start with an apostrophe ('), then type the number exactly as it should appear. The apostrophe tells Excel to store this cell as text, meaning it cannot be used for formulas.

 Click the Data tab on your ribbon menu, then look in the External Data Sources section. Click the icon labeled Text or From Text., Select the text file in the "Choose a File" window. Follow the onscreen instructions to complete Steps 1 and 2.
 In Step 3 of the Text Import Wizard, you should see a preview of your spreadsheet. Click on a column to select it, then select an option to set the format for that column. Specifically, to keep leading and trailing zeros in columns containing phone numbers and similar data, select those columns and choose Text. You can now complete the import and load your spreadsheet with the zeros, as intended.

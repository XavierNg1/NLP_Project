 Glue the three matchboxes one on the top of the other. To do this:


Take matchbox 1 and glue it on the top.
Place matchbox 2 on the top of matchbox 1. Glue the top of matchbox 2.
Place matchbox 3 on the top of matchbox 2.
Make sure that all the sides match up evenly. Wait for a few minutes to let the glue dry.;
, Using a measuring tape, measure around the stacked boxes and cut the decorative paper as per the measurements taken (use a ruler and pencil to mark on the paper). Spread glue all over the matchboxes, except for the front part, then stick the decorative paper on it. Leave to dry.


You can also do this step using rough assumptions if you do not have a flexible measuring tape.
 Take the drawers out and punch a small hole in the center of each drawer. This will be where the handles are placed. Use the paper fastener, or even split pins, as the pulling handle of the drawers. Fasten the split ends behind the inner side of the drawer.
 Slide the drawers back. As you do so, make sure that they are facing the right way up.
 Your little matchbox drawer set is now ready.

 Prepare a shallow baking dish by lining it with aluminum foil.


You will not be dehydrating the chicken in the oven. You should, however, cook the chicken for a brief time in the oven before you dehydrate it in order to kill any bacteria living inside. The heat provided by the dehydrator is insufficient for this task.;
, Use a sharp kitchen knife to slice the chicken into strips that are 1⁄8 to 1⁄4 inch (0.3 to 0.6 cm) (3.175 to 6.35 mm) thick.


The thinner the strips are, the more jerky you will have and the less time it will take to dry the meat.
 Toss the soy sauce, lemon juice, garlic powder, black pepper, and ginger in a 1 gallon (4 L) resealable plastic bag.


After adding the seasonings to the bag, zip it closed and toss the bag gently to mix the marinade together.
 Add the chicken strips to the bag in let them sit for 20 minutes to absorb the flavor.


Seal the bag and gently toss the chicken in the marinade so that all of the meat is well coated.
Place the meat in the refrigerator as it sits in the marinade.
 After pulling the chicken out of the marinade, place the strips on your prepared baking sheet and cook in your preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes.


Check the internal temperature using a meat thermometer. As soon as the chicken reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (75 degrees Celsius), immediately remove it from the oven.
 Preheat the dehydrator to 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius).


The dehydrator will need about 10 minutes to preheat, so this should be done as you pre-roast the chicken.
 As soon as the chicken is ready to remove from the oven, arrange the strips in single layers on dehydrator trays.


Place the trays in the dehydrator once done.
 Check the chicken jerky after the first 5 hours. It should be completely dry when done.


If it is not completely dry by that point, continue cooking up to an additional 2 hours, checking the jerky every 30 minutes.

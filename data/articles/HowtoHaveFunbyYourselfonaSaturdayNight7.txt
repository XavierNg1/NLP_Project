 If you have a bike and good path for cycling, go out for a bike ride. Cycling is a great form of exercise because you burn a lot of calories without as much high impact as running. Cycle around your area to get some exercise, and time your laps if you want to compete with yourself. Bike riding will depend a lot on the weather, so don't go out if it's too wet or cold and be careful on busy streets, as cars often don't see cyclists., Whether you have a treadmill or the weather is nice, get a little jogging in. Jogging will give you more energy for your activities later, and burn off some calories from any unhealthy food you may have eaten over the weekend. Make sure you have a good pair of running shoes and some comfortable workout clothes. Don't take it too fast if you don't run often, and make sure to stretch before and after you jog., If the weather allows, go for a swim. Whether you have access to a pool, a lake or the ocean, swimming is a great way to get some exercise. Swimming is even easier on your body than cycling or running, because it's even lower-impact than other cardio exercise. Grab a swimsuit and do some laps: time your laps for competitive fun., Weight lifting is great for your body, and helps you look good too. Keep in mind that one night of lifting weights won't do much for your physique. You'll have to keep it up and continue lifting weights several types a week. However, quiet Saturday nights are a great time to start. Go to a nearby gym or invest in a weight set for your house, then learn the basics. The types of exercises you need to do will depend on your goals, so talk to a trainer or consult weightlifting books for more information that's tailored to you.

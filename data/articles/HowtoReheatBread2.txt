 This will help it heat evenly and protect it from getting burned during the reheating process.
 Use the smallest possible pot that will still comfortably hold the bread. Put the lid on the pot.
 The low heat will gently warm the bread. Allow it to warm for about five minutes, then remove the bread and check to see if it has been thoroughly heated. If not, replace it in the pan and warm it for another few minutes.


An alternative method is to wrap the bread and steam it in a steamer pan above simmering water. Wrap it well so the steam doesn't get through and make the bread go soft. This method won't really revive a crisp crust, but it's suitable for hard, dry, day-old bread.

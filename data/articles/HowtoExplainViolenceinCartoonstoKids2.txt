 Don't lecture...start a dialogue. Critical thinking helps children develop skepticism when it comes to violence. Here's some questions you might ask:


That's interesting. If someone chased me with a frying pan, I'd call the police. What would you do?
These people seem to solve their problems with martial arts. Is that something you see at school?
Do you think falling off a cliff would hurt you? Why doesn't it for the Coyote?

, Understanding how media is not reality helps children realize it's make-believe.

Make a flip-book. Cartoons are based on this technological effect, not little people in a TV. It is also an excellent art and science project!
Visit a TV studio. Many communities have a local TV studio, such as a community cable studio, high school or college TV station. Seeing the equipment, people, and techniques that go into making a TV show helps build understanding.
 It is very easy to use aggression as a way of getting what you want but that it is something every person, including yourself, has to learn to overcome. It is very, very rare that one has to resort to physical violence to solve a situation.

Verbal violence is also not acceptable, including bullying language or concepts. This also means put-downs, name-calling, threats and so on. While more subtle, these are surprisingly common in cartoons.

 Being a hard worker will definitely get your further in the world of golf and you never know what professional golfer may hear your name.;
, No professional golfer will ever hire a caddy who has no experience or does not know anything about the sport. It is important to understand not only every aspect of the game, including rules and scoring, but also how the clubhouse operates.
 Express interest in working as a caddy to any available golfer. Granted, it's a long shot but many caddies got started this way.
 Most states host not only amateur events but also at least one professional event each year. Get involved in these events as often as possible regardless of what your job might be.
 Stay away from conflict with golfers and club staff as much as possible. Having a bad reputation in the golf world is the quickest way to ruin your chances in the professional sector.
 Give them to anyone you know in the golf world and leave a stack in every clubhouse you enter. These cards should have your name, what you are seeking, and a contact number and email. Even if you think one person at the golf course does not need it, she may know who can fulfill your dream.
 Nobody gets into professional caddying on the first try. You will be rejected many times before being accepted, but it's very important you take each rejection as a step toward your ultimate goal. You never know when you will get the call and all your dreams will come true.

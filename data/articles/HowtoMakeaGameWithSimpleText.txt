 Your plot will only need a problem at this point. Decide what starts your hero off. Will it be a lost cat? A martian invasion? Be creative.;
, Now that you have your problem, you will want to brainstorm ideas on how to make the player win or lose. This may take some time, but don't erase anything.
 Take a sharpie and cross out anything in your flow chart that you don't want.
 This will be your finished game, or you can make a script and use a series of hyperlinks on a website to make it an online game.
 Tell people about it, and play it.

 Many shopping cart accidents occur because the child is left alone in the cart when the parent steps away to grab something off a shelf. Even turning your back and taking one step away puts your child at risk. Stay with your child at all times while they are in a shopping cart.You should keep your child in your sight at all times. Even if you are standing right next to them, turning so you cannot see your child can put them at risk.
If you need to grab something, move your cart with you so you can stay close to your child and keep an eye on them.
 If you have an older child, donâ€™t let them push the cart when you have a younger child inside. This is unsafe. The older child may run into something, or the cart may tip over with the younger child inside.Always make sure an adult is pushing the cart when there is a child inside.
 If you cannot leave your child at home, consider shopping with another adult who can watch the child. They can stay with the shopping cart or push the child in a stroller while you control the cart.

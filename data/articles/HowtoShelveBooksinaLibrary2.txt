, As with the Dewey Decimal System, the more numbers and letters contained in a call number, the more specific the classification is—and the easier it is to find or shelve the book. The LC call number “PS3537 A426 C3 1951,” identifies the “Catcher in the Rye,” by J. D. Salinger, which was published in 1951 (the last four numbers in the call number.)

 Wash a bunch of kale under cold water until all the grit and dirt is completely washed away. Lay the kale leaves on top of each other on a cutting board. Hold the kale in place while you cut the kale into 1/4 inch strips.If the kale was very dirty, you can wash and rinse the kale again after you've cut it.
 Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat and add a few tablespoons of olive oil. Once the oil shimmers, add 1 sliced onion. Saute the onion for 3 to 4 minutes and stir in 2 or 3 cloves of minced garlic. Let the aromatic mixture cook another minute.For a little spice, consider stirring in a pinch of red chili pepper flakes.
 Add the cut kale to the mixture in your saucepan and add enough chicken or vegetable stock to cover the kale by about 1/2 an inch. You'll probably need about 3 cups of stock. Bring the kale to a simmer and cover the pan. Let the kale continue to cook for 30 minutes or until it's tender.You can add extra stock or water if you'd like to serve a little of the aromatic liquid with the kale.
Taste the boiled kale and add salt and pepper to taste.
 Boiled kale goes well with a hearty bread or toast. Try rubbing a little garlic on a piece of rustic toast. Top the toast with a fried egg and place some of the boiled kale on top.You could also sprinkle toasted breadcrumbs on top of the boiled kale, if you're short on time and need a quick serving idea.

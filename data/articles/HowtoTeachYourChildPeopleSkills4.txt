 People communicate both verbally and with their body language. If you want to teach your child people skills, you should focus on communicating through body language. For example, body movements, facial expressions, tone of voice, and volume are all important aspects of communication. Help your child pick up on nonverbal cues:Ask them questions about the show or movie they are watching. You could say “what is the main character feeling right now?”
They may respond stating that the character is scared. You could then ask “how do you know they are scared?” If your child struggles to answer this question, help them identify some body language features.
You could say “does the character look scared because they are shaking and their eyes are wide open?”

, You can also have your child practice their own body language and mannerisms as a way to teach them people skills. Body language is so important to the way we communicate and learning how to communicate through body language is an essential social skill. Role play some simple social situations with your child.For example, try teaching them how to enter a room. Begin by entering slouched over and staring at the floor. Then enter with your shoulders back, chin up, and smiling. Ask your child "which one is friendlier?" Then have them try and mimic your actions.
You can try this out with a number of different scenarios.
 Eye contact is an extremely important aspect of communication and is a fundamental people skill. By looking someone in the eye when communicating, you demonstrate appreciation and respect.

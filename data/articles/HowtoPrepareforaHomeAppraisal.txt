 Although appraisers are not home inspectors, they will be looking at the quality and condition of your home. Fix as many of the small issues as possible before the appraiser arrived. Make your beds and clean up. Most appraisers take photos of all rooms.;
, Have this list ready for the appraiser when they arrive. This will save time and allow the appraiser to visually look and see what items will actually affect your home's value.
, Not only will the appraiser be photographing the exterior (and most likely the interior as well) but they will also need to measure the exterior of the home.
 This includes plats or surveys, blueprints, homeowners declarations or condo covenants, recent home inspection or appraisal reports, etc.

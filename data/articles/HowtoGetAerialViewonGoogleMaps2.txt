 Look for the Google Maps app on your mobile device and tap on it.
 You can use the location button on the lower right corner to set the map to your current location or you can use the search box on the upper right corner to find another place on the map.


Finding your current location—Tap on the compass button on the lower right corner of the page. The map will adjust based on your current location. Your current location will be identified by a blue dot on the map.
Finding another location—Use the search box and type in the location you want. A shortlist of possible results will drop down. Tap on the location you want, and the map will automatically draw to the location you’ve set.
 It’s located inside the search box. The button has three horizontal lines on it.
 Tap “Satellite” from the menu, and the current map view will transform to an aerial view, showing you a bird’s-eye view of the current map or location.


You can zoom in or zoom out by tapping the + or - signs, respectively. Move around the map dragging your fingers around the screen.

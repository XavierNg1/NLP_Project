Any variety of hardwood chips can be used for adding smoke flavor to food cooked on a gas grill. Some of the most popular are hickory, oak, cherry and mesquite. Other items like olive pita and pecan shells can also be used. Wood chips can usually be bought wherever grills are sold.



 


Soak about a cup of chips in water for an hour. Although soaking isn't required to make the smoke, the chips will last much longer once they are smoking.

Drain the chips and place them in a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, about 18 inches (45.7 cm) square. Wrap the chips in the foil, sealing it tightly. Poke some holes in the top of the pouch using a knife or fork to allow the smoke to escape.


Place the pouch in the cold grill on top of the flavor bars or lava rocks under the grill grate. The pouch should be placed in the back corner of the grill so it is not directly underneath where food would be placed.






Preheat the grill to high, as you would any time you are preparing to grill.






Once you can see significant smoke coming from the pouch, add the food to the grill and cook according to your recipe.

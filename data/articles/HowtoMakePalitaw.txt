 Mix until the three ingredients are well combined. The ingredients should begin to form a dough as you combine them.If the dough seems too sticky, sprinkle with rice flour and keep kneading. If the dough seems too dry, add a few drops of water and keep kneading. Continue to adjust the dough with flour or water until you have a cohesive dough., The dough should feel smooth and dry to the touch, not sticky or wet. Then, divide the large ball of dough into small ping-pong ball sized balls. Flatten each ball into a patty., Put the dough patties into the boiling water one at a time to cook them. When the patties are cooked, they will float up to the top of the water., As soon as the patties float to the top, use a slotted spoon to remove them and place them on a plate.Allow the patties to cool down a little bit before handling them., Once the rice patties have cooled down enough to handle, coat them in the coconut mixture one at a time. Make sure that you get the coconut mixture on both sides of the patties. Press on the patties a little bit to help the mixture stick. Set each patty on a plate after you have coated it with the mixture.
 Arrange the patties on a serving plate. Set a pair of tongs near the plate to make it easier for your guests to pick up their Palitaw.

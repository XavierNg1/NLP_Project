 Lipstick isn't just for your lips. You can use it to change the color of your eyebrows. Use a small brush to apply it to your eyebrows, following the direction of the hair., Pick a bright, matte lip pencil. Because it is soft and bright, you'll get a fairly good color. Apply from the middle outward, working it into the hair as you would an eyebrow pencil. You can leave it as is, or you can brush some matte eyeshadow over the pencil with a stiff angled brush., If your eyebrows need filling in, add a little eyeshadow in the color you're going for, focusing on the skin. Brush the colored mascara onto your eyebrows, being careful not to go outside the lines.If you want, you can start with a lighter color on the inner edge of your eyebrow and change to a darker color halfway through. Just be sure to blend the two colors together in the middle so you don't get a stark line between the two.

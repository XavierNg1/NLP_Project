When most people think of Karate, they think of Tae Kwon Do, but in reality, there are so many more styles. In fact, the proper term for "Karate" is Martial Arts. Karate is actually its own style of Martial Arts along with Bando, Kenpo, Mauy Thai, Shotokan, Aikido, etc. Each style is unique in its own way. For example, people who train in Muay Thai and Bando are taught to be very aggressive, while people in Aikido learn to flow with their opponents movements in order to get them into pressure point holds.
 Choosing a school is very important, and it may also be very difficult. The first thing you're going to need to do is find the style that you'd like to train in.
 Another factor to think about when trying to choose a school is the instructor, or Sensei. Is he a guy who actually wants to train you, or just wants your money? A good way to tell is if he makes you work hard or not. Every time you leave class you should be sweating profusely! If not, then you may have a bad instructor on your hands.

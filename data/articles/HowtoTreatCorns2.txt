 Corns are generally caused by ill-fitting shoes. Purchase a new pair of shoes. Measure your feet at the store to determine if you have been purchasing shoes of the right of size. Typically, corns are a sign that your footwear is too tight.If corns are developing on the front of your toe, it is probably because the shoes are not long enough, whereas if it is developing between toes, it is because they are not wide enough. If you are getting them on the back of your foot near the heel, it is probably because the shoes are too loose.High heels can also cause corns. Refrain from wearing these if you have an issue with corns.
 It is possible that your shoes suddenly arenâ€™t fitting because you have allowed your nails to get too long. When the shoe becomes too tight on your foot, friction is created which in turn can lead to the growth of a corn., Wedges fit around or between toes to prevent them from rubbing together. This will limit friction, slowing the development of corns. Place the wedge on the affected area and walk normally., Orthotic shoe inserts or moleskin will hold the foot in a comfortable position and prevent it from rubbing on the shoe. Insert the pads where you are feeling discomfort.

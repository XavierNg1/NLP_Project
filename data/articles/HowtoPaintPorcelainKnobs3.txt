 Make sure you have a paintbrush available for each color if you don't want the paint to dry while you are cleaning your brush when you switch colors.


Choose soft, natural fiber paintbrushes when using porcelain craft paints. Examples include red sable or squirrel hair quill brushes.
 Use your paintbrushes or porcelain craft paint in the marker form to apply the paint to the knob.


Allow your work to dry after you finish with 1 color if you are worried about having different colors bleeding together and mixing while you paint. Resume painting with the next color once the first color has dried.
 Double check your particular brand of porcelain craft paint to make sure this is the correct firing temperature for your paint.
 The sides will keep the knobs from falling off the pan and onto the floor of your oven.
, Allow the knobs to cool completely before touching them. After firing, the design should be durable and dishwasher safe and will not require a varnish.

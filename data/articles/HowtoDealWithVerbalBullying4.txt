 Always have your friends around you. It's much more intimidating to a bully to deal with the group than with an individual. Of course, it isn't always possible to be with your friends, so don't be surprised if the bully works out just those moments when you are alone and tries to make the most of them. In this case, resort to some of the methods suggested in the previous section, or seek help, as discussed next.
 It can be helpful to talk to a family member or close friend, as they will give you reassurance that you're a great person (you are anyway but it's nice to have someone tell you face-to-face). Even if they are not in a position to solve the problem, they can help you cope.
 Tell a teacher, school guidance counselor, trusted adult, parent, human resources officer, trusted friend, etc., if the bullying continues. You could ask if it's possible to be kept anonymous but in order to deal with this properly, a little courage will go a long way. Remember that the bully has problems that need tending too, it's not just about needing to protect yourself.


At school, ask your principal for help. He/she will most likely call whoever bullied you and confront them.

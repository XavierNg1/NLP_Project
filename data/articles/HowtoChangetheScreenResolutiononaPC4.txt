 It's at the bottom of the menu. This will open the "Display Properties" window.


If "Display Properties" doesn't open to the "Settings" tab, click it at the top of the window.
 It's near the bottom of the "Display Settings" window. Dragging the slider to the left will decrease your screen resolution, while dragging it to the right will increase the resolution.


Raising your resolution will make things smaller, while lowering the resolution will make things larger. If you are having difficulty seeing things on your computer, try lowering your resolution. If you want the clearest picture possible, raise the resolution to the size recommended for your display.
 It's at the bottom of the window. After doing so, your screen will change resolution, and a confirmation box will appear.
 Doing this will save your resolution settings.


If you don't like the new resolution settings, wait for a few seconds; the screen will revert to the old settings.
 Your new resolution will be saved.

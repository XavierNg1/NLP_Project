 Spending time outside your home is a great way to run into your neighbors. It also gives the impression that you’re enjoying the neighborhood and that you’re open to meeting others who live there.


Take a walk. This might sound simple, but you would be amazed at how many people you can meet by just going for a walk. Evenings between 5pm and 6pm when many people are returning from work is a great time to meet your neighbors. Wave a quick hello or walk over and introduce yourself.
Read a book on your deck or porch, or relax out on a lawn chair or blanket in your front yard. If you're working on a watercolor or a crossword puzzle, you could take that outside, too.
Wash your car out in your driveway. Take advantage of sunny days and instead of driving to a car wash, sparkle up your vehicle yourself. It creates opportunity to speak with your neighbors and introduce yourself.
Do some gardening. You might find that there are other gardening enthusiasts right down the street. Share tips or ask gardening questions for an easy way to get a conversation going.;
, A small get-together to celebrate a housewarming is a perfect time to throw a party for yourself. If you’re still working on unpacking and decorating the inside of your home, a casual backyard picnic or barbecue is a great way to get to know your new neighbors.


Make sure to invite close neighbors and those that you might see on a regular basis.
You may want to introduce your family and friends to your new neighbors. Consider extending an invitation to relatives or close friends who may be frequently visiting your new home.
 If you happen to see one of your new neighbors in a neighborhood store or restaurant, go over and say hello. If you bank at the same financial institution or pick up your mail at the same post office, these are great opportunities to connect with your neighbors. You’d be surprised how much a simple hello and introduction can be appreciated.

 The Bhramari pranayama, often called "the bee breath," focuses on a smooth nasal inhalation and a steady, vocal exhalation through the nostrils.Breathe in slowly and deeply through both nostrils., As you exhale, you should train your throat to make a soft, elongated hum of the letter "e." This should produce the characteristic buzzing sound associated with "the bee breath."Exhale slowly through both nostrils.Start out with a soft, silent "eee" buzz, and gradually increase the volume as you become more comfortable with this breathing routine. Do not strain your throat. The buzzing should feel somewhat natural., Once you've sufficiently practiced the bee breath, you can add some variety to your technique. This can help give you a deeper sense of calm as you perfect the Bhramari pranayama.

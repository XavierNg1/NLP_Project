 Countering is when a player sneaks in from the corner of the court and very quickly moves toward the neutral zone to attack an opposing player. It’s a risky move, and it can only be performed by a single (and brave) countering player. If you’re countering, be speedy and go for the element of surprise.Reserve countering for when you’ve only got a single ball on your side.Countering is a good move to break out after there’s been an elimination. Players might be distracted, and this is the time to strike!, Because counters are all about speed, they’re hard to dodge. You may not be able to jump fast or high enough straight up into the air to get away from this ball. Do a back dive or side-jump to avoid these tough throws.Be extremely careful when you do a back dive. These dangerous moves could injure you, especially if you hit your head on the ground. Try and absorb the fall on the fleshy part of your bottom, and keep your head and neck up off the floor.
 This tricky move is called the “butterfly and the bee.” Throw one ball up in the air to confuse your opponents. While their attention is on that ball, throw a second ball straight at them., Dodgeball can be a fun and even quirky game. If you’re in a league that allows cartwheels and coordinated jumps, do them! You’ll have fun with these slightly weird strategies, and they’ll confuse your opponents.Time a group jump or a cartwheel by using a codeword.
Make sure that these moves don’t get you eliminated. Only do them if you’re sure you can dodge balls while you’re distracting the other team with your unexpected skills.
 This is called a drop-catch. Hold the ball you’ve got in front of you, inviting the other team to target you. Drop the ball, and catch a ball that’s been thrown at you.Only do this if it looks like you’ll be able to catch one of the incoming balls. Otherwise, continue dodging the balls, or keep hold of the ball you’ve got to block them.

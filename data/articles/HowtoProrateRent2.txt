 This is the most appropriate option when dealing with a year long lease. Multiply the monthly rent amount by 12 in order to get the total yearly rent amount.


Monthly rent is the amount of rent charged every month that the tenant will occupy the apartment, condo or house a full month.
For example, a tenant might pay $900 per month. $900 x 12 = $10,800 in rent per year.
 Divide the total yearly rent amount by 365 (the number of days in the year) in order to get the daily prorated rent amount.


For example, if your yearly rent amount is 10,800$, 10,8000/365=29.5$ in rent per day.
For yearly rent, it does not matter which month you are currently in.
 Multiply the daily prorated rent amount by the number of occupancy days remaining in the month to get the prorated rent amount.Number of occupancy days is how many days you will be renting the apartment before the first day of the next month begins.For example, if you moved in on September 20, your number of occupancy days is 11 (just like hotels book rooms, you include the day you move in). 11 days x 29.5$/day = 324.50$ total.
ANSWER = x # of days youâ€™re staying

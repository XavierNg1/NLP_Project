 The latest variations on the Windows software have changed the way you get to the Command Prompt. To start, access the Shut Down menu (this may be done by pointing your mouse to the bottom left side of the screen for Windows 8, or pressing the Start tab for 8.1 and 10) and holding ⇧ Shift while you press the Restart button. Instead of fully restarting you computer, it will bring up a option screen. , Once you've held down ⇧ Shift and pressed restart, you'll need to go through a couple of blue screens to get to the new OS's version of the Command Prompt. Click the Troubleshoot button, then access Advanced Options in the following screen. From there, there should be a Startup Settings button. From there, you'll be able to tweak your computer to let you access Command Prompt next time you reboot. , Once you arrive at the Startup Settings, you'll be able to choose a few options on what you're looking to make the computer do the next time it restarts. Set your choices if you have any preferences, then press the Restart button that's offered in the bottom-right of the screen.
 Pressing your F6 key after commanding the computer to restart will bring you straight to the Command Prompt. From there, you can input your commands and run your diagnostics, the same as with earlier PC operating systems.
 Alternatively (and arguably more simply) you can hold the Windows key and press X for a menu to access Command Prompt. This is provided your computer's desktop is working fine however; given that paying a visit to the Command Prompt is usually a result of something being wrong with the computer's basic functionality, this convenience may not be available to you when you want it.

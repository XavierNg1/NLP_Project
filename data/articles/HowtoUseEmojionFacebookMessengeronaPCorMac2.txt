 This is Facebook’s official Messenger app, and it runs right in your web browser.


If you’re not already signed in, click Continue as <your name> or log in with your Facebook username and password.
If you’re using a Messenger app that wasn’t made by Facebook (such as the downloadable Messenger for Desktop), double-click its icon to access Messenger.
 The list of recent conversations runs down the left side of the screen. You can also find a conversation by typing a person’s name into the Search box at Messenger’s top-right corner.
 If you want to include text in in addition to emoji, you can type it into the box at the bottom of the screen.
 It’s the gray smiling face at the bottom of the chat (the fourth icon from the left).
 Use the scrollbar at the right side of the emoji list to see more options, and the category buttons (smiley face, bear, hamburger, etc.) to sort by category.


You can insert as many emoji as you’d like.
 Your message with emoji will now appear in the conversation.

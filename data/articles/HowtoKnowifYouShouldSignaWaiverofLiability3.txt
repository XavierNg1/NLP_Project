 Your state law determines whether a waiver is valid.Accordingly, you will need to research your state’s law on when a court will enforce a waiver of liability.


In North Carolina, for example, a waiver is generally enforceable. However, it will not be enforced if the company intentionally injured you or consciously disregarded a danger.
North Carolina also will not enforce a waiver if you signed it because of fraud or coercion.Other states are more hostile to waivers of liability than North Carolina. Louisiana, Montana, and Virginia all refuse to enforce waivers of liability.It may be difficult to find out the status of your state law. Court opinions are not easy to find. You can search the Internet for summaries of your state’s law. Alternately, you could meet with a lawyer, who can inform you of the current status of your law.
 If your child signed a waiver of liability, then he or she can generally cancel the waiver because minors cannot contract. In most states, someone younger than 18 is a minor who cannot form a valid contract.


In most states, parents also can’t waive their child’s negligence claim. Accordingly, even if an adult signs the waiver, the minor can cancel it anyway., Only a lawyer can advise you properly about whether you can sue someone if you signed a waiver. State law often changes, and you want the most up-to-date information.


You shouldn’t assume that because you signed a waiver you’ll never be able to get money from the company that injured you.A skilled attorney can make the case that your injury falls outside the coverage of the waiver.

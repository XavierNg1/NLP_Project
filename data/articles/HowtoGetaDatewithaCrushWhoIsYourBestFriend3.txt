 Let your friend know that you truly value the friendship but that you also have romantic feelings for them and would like to be more than friends.
 Pressuring them into giving you an answer or starting a relationship right away might make them uncomfortable. Show that you respect them as a friend by giving them time to think.
 If your friend does not want to pursue a romantic relationship, respect their choice and do not pressure them further. If you want to remain friends, let them know how important it is to you to maintain a platonic friendship.

 A wide, flat baking dish has the right shape. Use a spoon to scoop all of the rice into the dish and spread it evenly.









Use a nonstick dish if you have one available, since rice tends to stick to the bottom of the pan.
If you don't have a nonstick dish, oil the bottom of a glass or metal baking dish.
 Use the back of a wooden spoon to press the rice flat into the dish. You could also use a spatula or a piece of oiled waxed paper.
 Use a knife to score the rice diagonally in one direction, then score it again diagonally in the other direction. This creates the classic diamond shape that Sri Lankans use to serve milk rice.
 After the rice has cooled a stiffened a bit, use the knife to cut it into diamond shapes. Lift the rice from the pan using a spatula and place it on a plate for serving.









You can make the dish taste more milky by drizzling the top with more coconut milk after scoring it.
Milk rice is traditionally served with curry.

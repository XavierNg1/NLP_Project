 The documentation provided when you bought the printer may have information on how to clear a jam. Follow any instructions that are provided.;
, Some laser printer models will provide diagnostic information during a paper jam, such as where to look for the problem, or how to pull the paper out. Follow any instructions that show up on the printer or computer screen.
 Laser printers have fusers that provide heat, so if the paper jam is near the fuser, let the printer cool off before you touch anything.
 Pull open any door and slide any tray that moves to give you the best view of where the jam has occurred.
 With the doors open, you should be able to see the paper and where it is jammed. Look around the inside of the entire printer to make sure there are not other sheets stuck, or small strips or scraps of paper that might have torn off. Common locations of paper jams in laser printer include paper input and output trays, the fuser, the toner cartridge, and any other place that paper comes into contact with a roller.


Grab the handle on the toner cartridge and gently pull it out to give you a look at any paper that may be stuck around it. Replace the toner cartridge after you have cleared the paper, or ensured that no paper is stuck inside of it.
 Gently hold on to the paper and pull it out of the laser printer.


Try to pull the paper in the direction that it normally feeds. Pulling it backwards can damage the laser printer's function.
Remove all of the paper and scraps. Do not leave anything behind that can cause additional jamming.
 Most laser printer models will reset themselves automatically, and you will be able to re-print what you had started.

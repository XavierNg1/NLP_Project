 Donâ€™t settle on simple tongue twisters for kids. Look for the longest, most difficult tongue twisters you can find. Select a number of tongue twisters that focus on different letters of the alphabet.


Try out something like this: "I'm not the pheasant plucker, I'm the pheasant plucker's mate, And I'm only plucking pheasants 'cause the pheasant plucker's late. I'm not the pheasant plucker, I'm the pheasant plucker's son, And I'm only plucking pheasants till the pheasant pluckers come.";
, Focus on the enunciation of the words. Pronounce each syllable clearly and as quickly as you can. This will help loosen up the muscles in your tongue so you can speak at a faster rate.
 This exercise will improve your breathing so you can use better technique when rapping. It can also help improve your lung capacity. This is important to being able to rap fast because it teaches you to say more words with each breath.


If you can't say the tongue twister in a single breath, try some additional breathing exercises to get you there.
Hissing is a good beginning breathing exercise.Breathe in to the count of 4. Breathe out, hissing, to the count of 4. Then, breathe in for 6, and hiss out for 10. Breathe in for 6, out for 12. Breathe in for 2, out for 12. Breathe in for 4, out for 16. Breathe in for 2, out for 16. Breathe in for 4, out for 20. Breathe in for 1, out for 20.
 When you accidentally mess up, start over until you get it perfectly. You want to get it right the first time and every time. When rappers perform live, they only get one shot at getting it right. Mistakes are bound to happen, so don't beat yourself up over it. Just keep working to minimize their frequency.
 Try this exercise for 5 to 10 minutes a day to practice your technique and build speed. If you want you can time yourself to see how much faster you are getting over time.

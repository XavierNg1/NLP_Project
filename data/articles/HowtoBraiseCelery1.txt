 Start with eight stalks of celery. Thoroughly scrub the celery, running it under water to clean it. Cut off the brown ends, and peel off the extra chewy part on the outside of the celery if you prefer. Chop the celery into 1-inch pieces.Onions and celery make a nice addition to this dish, but you'll need to cook them a little before adding the celery.;
, Place a medium-sized skillet over medium heat. Let the butter melt in it. Add the celery into the pan. Sprinkle on a dash of salt and pepper. Leave the celery uncovered, cooking it about 5 minutes and stirring it occasionally., After the celery starts to cook a bit, pour the broth in. Beef broth is best, but chicken or vegetable broth would also work. Mix it in with the celery. Put the lid on the skillet, and reduce the heat. Let the celery cook for another 5 minutes., Take the lid off. Let the liquid reduce down. You don't want celery soup. Rather, the liquid should thicken a bit and coat the celery. You'll only need to cook it for approximately another 5 minutes.For a bit of freshness, add a tablespoon of finely chopped fresh parsley before reducing the liquid.

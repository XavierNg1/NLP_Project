 Both in and outside of school, children can learn to sing. One-on-one lessons with an instructor can help to teach them how to obey instructions from strangers other than their parents, lessons in pre-school may promote socialization with children their own age, and parent-child classes can strengthen familial bonds. Any music class will help promote math, memorization, motor and social skills, as well as patience among many other things., Although parents might think that toddlers are too young to start learning to play a musical instrument, if your child shows an interest, why not indulge it? Instruments like the piano, xylophone, bells, or the recorder are not too difficult to learn to play even for young children. Some places will even allow children to try multiple different kinds of instruments until they find one they especially like.
 If you have a particular faith you believe strongly in, chances are you will want your children to participate too. Many parents will find it a challenge to get their young kids to sit through a lengthy service which requires them to stay still, pay attention, and be silent. There are however other options: some religious institutions offer special classes and camps specifically designed for children that incorporate song and dance. This allows them to express their energy and learn more about your chosen faith in an environment more suited to them.

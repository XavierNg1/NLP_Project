Use bare bulbs or a simple glass covering over your bulbs.Alternately, antique hanging light fixtures might work, or light fixtures that resemble a candelabra with candle-style bulbs.;
, Instead of the traditional wide, rectangular, across-the-wall mirror that you find in most modern bathrooms, choose a round hanging mirror.Alternately, use boxy mirrors with a square or rectangular shape instead of round hanging mirrors.
 Tubs, not showers, are the preferred bathing technology in the farmhouse style bathroom.A simple white tub elevated on four legs (known as a clawfoot tub) is the best option.Avoid installing a plastic shell-style tub. They are inappropriate for a farmhouse style bathroom.
 A small glass vase of lilacs will look great on a shelf in your farmhouse style bathroom.Alternately, place a tin or copper bucket with wild flowers or ferns on your counter.You might also like white flowers like daisies to match your white décor.
Avoid bold colors like bright red or orange.
Stick to a single color or species when selecting foliage for your farmhouse style bathroom.
 Imagery will help emphasize your bathroom’s farmhouse theme. Pictures of farm animals like chickens, cows, or horses are good options, as are scenes depicting crops and fields. Choose art that evokes farm life to put the finishing touch on your farmhouse style bathroom.You might also choose to incorporate antique signs that gesture toward small-town life of a previous era.

 Place the petals you pick into a container or colder, as you will have to wash them once you get them home.


Make sure you use a container that is sturdy enough that it will protect your petals from getting squished.
 If you have not already done so, place your rose petals in a colander or strainer. Rinse your rose petals under a gentle stream of water.


Doing this will help to remove the petals of dirt, pollen, and bugs.
 Place your petals on a paper towel so that they are not overlapping. Spacing the petals out will promote airflow so that the petals can dry more quickly and will not get stuck together.


Press the petals lightly with another paper towel. However, be careful not to crush or bruise the petals.
 If youâ€™re planning to use the petals immediately in your cooking or to create rose water, you can use your petals now. If you would like to preserve them, dry them in a safe place, or use a dehydrator to dry them in three hours.


You can tell that petals are dry when they are no longer soft to the touch.

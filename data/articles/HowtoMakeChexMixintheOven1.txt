 Obviously, this is a no-brainer, but remember: Chex offers more than one variety of cereal. For the most variety, go with equal portions of different types of Chex. Or, go with your gut and load it with more of your favorite (and even omit the others entirely). Chex offers more varieties than these, but Chex mixes usually use a combination of: Corn
Rice
Wheat;
, For a traditional Chex mix, go with pretzels, mixed nuts, and garlic-flavored bagel chips.But this is your own mix, so feel free to experiment. Try mixing things up by either partially or totally replacing the pretzels, nuts, and bagel chips (or even the Chex) with other dry or salty snacks, like:

Other cereals, such as Cheerios or WheatiesCheesy crackers, like Cheeze-Its or GoldfishOther types of chips, such as potato or rye, When it’s time to bake, you’re going to combine your dry ingredients with melted butter and Worcestershire sauce.If you like things spicy, though, consider adding a tablespoon of either:

Sriracha sauce
Hot sauce
Adobo sauce

, To mimic original Chex mix, stick to seasoned salt, garlic powder, and onion powder.However, feel free to tinker in order to please your own tastes. Consider seasoning your butter/sauce mixture with other ingredients like:Rosemary
Black pepper
Sugar

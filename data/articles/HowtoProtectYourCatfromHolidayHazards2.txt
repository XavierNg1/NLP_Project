 Your cat may be tempted to climb your Christmas tree if you have one up. If you have a cat, consider anchoring your Christmas tree so it will not fall over and hurt you, your cat, or a visitor.


To do this, wrap fishing line around the top of the tree and tie it to a sturdy structure., If your house has a real Christmas tree, make sure you keep your cat from drinking from the water bowl underneath it. This water could be filled with harmful chemicals, fertilizers, and bacteria that were drained through the tree.


When you are home, make sure you keep your cat away from the tree water.
If you aren't home, find a way to keep your cat away from the water, such as putting a small gate around the tree or keeping your cat in a different room., During the holiday season, you may have tinsel or foil icicles around your house. Since cats love to play with shiny things, these decorations may be a disaster waiting to happen. If you cat gets a hold of these things and swallows it, the tinsel can pleat up your cat's bowel and then shred her insides. This will cause your cat to be very sick and she may need to have life-saving surgery.


This is also true for ribbons on gifts as well., Hanging glass ornaments or table decorations can be very dangerous for your cat. These decorations can easily be grabbed or batted by your cat, which can cause them to shatter. The shattered pieces can cause her to cut herself and cause major injury.


If your cat eats any of these shattered pieces, she may also sustain internal injuries.

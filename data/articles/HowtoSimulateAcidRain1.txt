 This experiment simulates the emission of harmful gases into the environment that combine with water in the sky to lower the pH and cause acid rain. To perform this simulation, you will need an eyedropper, distilled water, a glass jar with a lid, bromothymol blue, a small clear container, and matches that have a high sulfur content.Bromothymol blue is a solution that changes color when pH drops and can be purchased online.
The small container can be glass or plastic as long as it is clear.
Adult supervision is recommended while using the matches.;
, Pour about 10 mL of distilled water into the small clear container. The exact amount of water doesn’t matter, but 10 mL is a good amount for this experiment. Use the eyedropper to gradually add the bromothymol blue to the distilled water until the solutions turns a light blue.10 mL is about equal to two teaspoons.When bromothymol blue comes into contact with an acid, the color of the solution turns yellow.
 Light several matches and then drop them in a glass jar while still lit. Place the lid on to collect the gases. Wait until the matches burn out.With the lid on the jar you have trapped the carbon dioxide and sulfur gases produced by the matches. These gases are the same gases that get trapped in our atmosphere.
Have adult supervision during this step

, Open the jar containing the matches and pour the entire container of bromothymol blue solution into the jar. Put the lid back on the jar as quickly as possible to keep all of the gases in the jar.Shake the jar to mix the gases from the matches with the bromothymol blue solution.
 Because bromothymol blue turns yellow when acid is introduced to it, you should observe that the solution has turned yellow. This experiment is a model of how gases can dissolve in water to decrease the pH of the water, making it more acidic.If the water doesn’t turn yellow, you may need to burn more matches to trap more gas.
Alternatively, you can use less water and try again.

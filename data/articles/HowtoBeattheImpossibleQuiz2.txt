 Some of the questions require extreme precision and timing with your cursor or touch screen. If you're on a laptop, plug in a mouse instead of relying on your mouse pad.
 The game lets you earn "Skips" which can be used to skip some questions if you get stuck, but don't be tempted! It is impossible to beat the game unless you have all seven "Skips" unused on question 110 (the last question).
 A list of numbers is written on the screen on question 50. Write these numbers down, and be prepared to type them in on question 108.

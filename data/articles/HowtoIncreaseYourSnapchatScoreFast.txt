 Your Snapchat score increases by one point for every snap you send if you snap at least once a day.If you don't use Snapchat for a few days, your score will go up by several points the first time you send a snap when you return.;
, In addition to gaining points from sending snaps, you'll also get one point for every photo or video snap you open.


To open snaps, swipe right on the camera screen and tap a red or purple square to the left of a person's name.
 Sending a "text" message through Snapchat doesn't actually net you any Snapchat points, nor does opening text messages.


You can avoid sending chat messages by double-tapping a chat message from a friend and then tapping the circular "Capture" button at the bottom of the screen to respond with a photo.
 For each person you select when sending a snap, you'll receive one point (e.g., selecting ten friends will result in ten more points).


After taking a snap and tapping the white "Send" arrow, you can tap friends' names to select them. Each person you select will receive your snap when you tap the "Send" arrow again.
The more people to whom you send snaps, the more often you'll receive snaps that you can open back.
 Since you gain an additional one point per snap that you post to your story, sending every snap that you send to other people to your story as well is a good strategy for increasing the amount of overall points you earn.

 onto the floor, put that and everything else into a big pile.;
, Use a broom to sweep items in a big pile to clean up through., Clean all the surfaces with a moist rag. Dry wood furniture immediately. wash the windows by using a mixture of hot water and soap, then (carefully) a window cleaner. Be careful not to leave streaks!

, don't start cleaning just yet. focus on what you want to throw away, such as empty cups and plates. after you're done, don't put the bag away in case you find something else you want to throw out.
 For example, if you see a book on the floor, go around the area and pick up all the books. then put them away. then move on to the next category of items. This will save you time so you don't have to dash here - there - everywhere!


If you find something that belongs in a different room, get a box and put it all in there so you don't waste time.
 Either sweep the floor, vacuum (for wood floors) or vacuum first, then spray carpet cleaner on the carpet.
 If you see something messy, clean that. Now is the time to untangle your jewelry, dust your light bulbs, and wipe your computer screen. If you see any stray items, put them where they go or make a place for them.
, go around the house and put that away.

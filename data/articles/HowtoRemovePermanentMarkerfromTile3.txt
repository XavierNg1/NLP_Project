 You can purchase dry erase markers from your local pharmacy, arts and crafts store, or discounted retailer. Make sure to purchase a black dry erase marker as opposed to a colored one.Remember to test a small, hidden area first before using it on larger, affected areas.
 Instead of tracing the entire stain, start by tracing a small part of the stain first. This method works best on smooth tile. For textured tile, the toothpaste or all-purpose solution may be more effective., Or you may use a rag or cloth to wipe off the traced sections. If the stain isnâ€™t completely removed the first time, then re-trace the remaining spots with the dry erase marker. Wipe until the stain is removed.Use warm water and soap to clean the affected area after the stain is removed.

 You are going to give away candy to people in order to get their votes. It will give you an easy way to talk to them and tell them about how awesome you are. Plus you are giving them candy, so you are already pretty awesome. Now, when they think of you, they think of candy, and they think of awesomeness.




Go to the grocery store and buy some big bulk packs of individually-wrapped candy (like they have at Halloween). (Everyone likes chocolate. Hershey's Chocolate, Milky Way, 3 Musketeers and Twix are best bets.)

Then go to Office Depot or Walmart and pick up lots of printable mailing label stickers (the cheaper the better, you are going to need hundreds of them, depending on the amount of people in your class. White ones are fine.)

Go home and print out labels that say "VOTE ______ for Orchestra Vice-President" and include a catchy slogan/tagline for yourself that you come up with like "The People's Choice" or something like that.
Attach those labels to each piece of candy.
Before class each day leading up to the election, you and your helpers from Step 1 will start giving away candy to people in orchestra. Before you give them the candy, get them to promise you their vote. Give them a good reason to do so (one of your keys from question 3 in Step 1)

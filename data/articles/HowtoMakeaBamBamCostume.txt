 Felt from a bolt at the craft store works great for this project because it doesn’t fray. You can also dig in your closet for an old orange or brown t-shirt or sweatshirt., Buy a half-inch width of elastic that will cover this width.
 Add two inches (5cm) to the measurement for the waistband.
 Then, measure the length and cut it to the knee measurement you just took. You should have an orange rectangle that will serve as a skirt.
 Place the elastic across the top and fold the top edge down over the elastic. Pin it in place, leaving about a quarter of an inch (0.6cm) below the pin for the seam.
 You can also sew by hand if you don’t have a sewing machine.
 Turn it inside out. Sew through both layers for an easy hem.
 Cut up about three inches to make triangles. The bottom hem of the skirt should be zigzagged all the way around, to follow the Flintstones famous fashions.
 Cut a long four-inch (10cm) section with your fabric scissors. Attach it with pins to the front right-hand side of the skirt and the back left-hand side.
 Adjust and pin accordingly. Sew the strap inside the waistband of the skirt.
 You will need about 30 2-inch (5cm) triangles for the skirt and 10 for the cap.
, A stuffed, white dog toy is ideal, but you can also use a lightweight dog bone. Glue it onto the front of the strap on the skirt.
 A white mop head can also work for this purpose. Set the new mop head on the wearer’s head and then trim around the ears.
 A hunter’s cap works well, or you can look for a small beanie. Glue the remaining triangles onto the cap with fabric glue.
 Spray paint it brown. Have your child hold it. You can create a plush version out of extra fabric and stuffing if you are afraid of damage.

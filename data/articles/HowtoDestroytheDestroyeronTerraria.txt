 He is a boss similar to EoW, since they both share the Worm AI. However he is much, much longer, and a little thicker. Each unit of his body has a red flashing light, which eventually detaches and becomes a Probe, which fires lasers at you. Once defeated, he drops Souls of Might.
 You could try a Dao of Pow (flail weapons are good for these types of boss), a Hallowed Helmet (don't even try to get it--it's hard, but I'll write an article on it later), and Mythril Boots and Chestplate. You will also need a good amount of greater healing potions, which can be crafted from a bottle of water, some Pixie Dust, and some Crystal Shards., You need to make a Mechanical Worm, which is crafted from 6 rotten chunks, 5 iron bars, 5 copper bars, and 7 Souls of Night. He can only be spawned at night., He spawns off screen, so be ready and waiting. Unlike the EoW, Destroyer likes to get underground and zip up at you at an almost straight vertical angle. From then on, just attack him and his Probes until he dies. If your health gets low, drink a GHP (Greater Healing Potion). If your health gets really low and the cool-down for healing potions isn't up yet, then teleport home to the nurse and heal up.

Be careful if you do, because he might kill a few of your NPCs.
 Once he's dead, he drops Souls of Might, which can be used to craft Excalibur, Megashark, and other useful items..

 In order to maintain your flute, you need to be familiar with its parts. There are three joints:


the headjoint: the piece that creates the majority of the sound

the body: the piece where most of the keys are, and

the footjoint: the short end piece with a few important keys;
, You must always be careful when doing any activity where you are not playing, such as holding or walking with your flute in hand, or even setting it on a chair.

When placing your flute on a chair, disassemble it so that it doesn't roll off. Carefully set the pieces down, and make sure nobody sits on it!
When holding your flute, you should not hold the keys or the rod down. This could damage the keys. You want to hold it in an area where you are not touching any keys.
Be extra careful when walking with your flute in hand, especially in tight quarters, as flutes are long.
 Part of caring for a flute is cleaning it. After each time you play, you need to clean out your flute. If you don't, it can cause the keys to fill with dirt and grime, and can even cause keys to fall off. You can use a cleaning rod with a clean fabric, or you can buy a fluffy rod from music stores (it's basically a plastic stick with "fluff" on it to properly clean a flute). Use a different cloth to polish the outside to keep it shiny. Always remember to be gentle with your flute (don't hold the keys!)., Dirty, sticky keys make your flute harder to play. One thing a lot of flute players do not use, or even know about, is powder papers. They can be bought at music stores, and are used to clean the keys so that they don't become sticky. All you have to do is press the key over the paper gently a few times on each key, and you should be fine.

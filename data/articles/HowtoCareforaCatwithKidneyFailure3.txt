 Cats with failing kidneys tend to have high blood pressure (also known as hypertension). This problem places them at greater risk of throwing blood clots and having strokes. In addition, hypertension can cause fluid to accumulate between the retina and the back of the eye, causing retinal detachment and sudden blindness.
 Because hypertension is such an issue, you should make sure that your veterinarian checks your cat’s blood pressure regularly.


If your cat's blood pressure is slightly high, an ACE inhibitor may reduce it by as much as 10%.
If the hypertension is more severe, your veterinarian may recommend an antihypertensive medication, such as amlodipine. The average dose is 0.625-1.25 mg once per day – this is about an eighth of a 5 mg tablet.
 Because cats with failing kidneys have weaker urine, they are more prone to urinary infections. Lower-grade infections may produce no symptoms, but they still need to be treated because bacteria can travel from the bladder into the kidney, contributing to renal damage.


Your veterinarian should perform a urine culture at least twice a year in order to identify infections. He or she may prescribe antibiotics if the culture turns up positive.

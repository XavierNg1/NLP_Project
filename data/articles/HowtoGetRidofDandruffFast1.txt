 Dry shampoo can clean and moisturize your scalp when applied before you go out. It can be found in drugstores or online and comes in spray and powder form. To apply, spray your hair a few times or sprinkle a little on top of your scalp. Comb in the spray or powder, which will help comb out any dandruff flakes. Rinse your comb after each stroke.Talcum powder can be used instead, but it can make dark or black hair look grey, white, or dotted.;
, Find the region of your scalp with the most dandruff, and comb your hair so it covers this area. Hairstyling products may help you achieve this task, but fluffing up your hair into a tousled look can work as a quick improvement.Covering up the dandruff is not actually treating anything, and you should keep in mind that this is only a quick visual fix. The best way to get rid of dandruff is to actually use treatment methods that will affect the underlying causes.
 Select a shirt, dress, or other top with a white, grey, or metallic appearance. This will make white or yellow dandruff flakes much less noticeable.Textured or patterned clothing may help hide the dandruff as well.
 Any cap, hat, or scarf can be used to hide the dandruff on your scalp. As long as it's on, it will also minimize the number of dandruff flakes that fall onto your clothing. Plus, people will not be able to see any flakes that are stuck to your hair.
 Pocket a mini-lint roller before you head outside. Any time you see dandruff flakes on your clothing, make a trip to the bathroom and use the lint roller to pick them up off the fabric.

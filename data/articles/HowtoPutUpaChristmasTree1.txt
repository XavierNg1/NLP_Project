 A visit to your local Christmas tree farm is a good way to begin.;
, Remove any dead needles by shaking it outside before putting it up.
 Check the ceiling height and the necessary width, and place the tree away from heat sources.


Also consider how pets and children might get at it, how it might fall over (or what it might fall onto), and if it proves an obstacle.
Do not put it too close to the fireplace.
 Tighten the screws and make sure it's sturdy. The screws don't need to screw into the tree, but they must not move.
 It will be a thirsty tree to begin with.


Have water touching the base of the tree at all time. If there's not, a layer of sap will form. If that happens, you'll need to make another cut, as the tree can't drink through the sap layer.
 Place a tree bag around the base of your tree. This not only catches the needles and makes for super easy clean up when you're done with it, but you can just remove all the decorations, then grab the bag, give it a tug, and the tree is bagged and ready to go.
 For the first week or so, a 7-foot tree could go through about 2 quarts of water a day. Make sure it doesn't run out of water. If you take good care of this tree, it could last for over a month.

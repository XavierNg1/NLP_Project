 Place 4 cups of sugar, 1 cup of corn syrup, 1 cup of water, and 1/4 tsp. of salt into the saucepan and stir the ingredients together until the sugar is melted. Use a pastry brush to wipe down the sides of the pan to keep sugar crystals from forming.;
, Then, pour the hot liquid into a shallow and heatproof container. Then, add the extract and food coloring that you're using and stir the ingredients well. Though this recipe calls for raspberry extract and pink food coloring, you can use any extract or food coloring you want.
 You can also spread it on the floor so it will catch any bits of falling sugar that may go over the table.
 Dip the decapitated whisk into the sugar syrup. Hold it over the pot and allow the sugar to drip back into the container for just a second. Hold it about one foot (30 cm) above the parchment and swing it back and forth so that very thin strands of sugar begin to fall on the paper. Keep going a few more times until you've got a nice looking nest of spun sugar. Know that it won't look like the machine cotton candy you're used to.
 You should do this right away, or the sugar will get brittle and would bend around the sticks.
 This is a dish best enjoyed immediately, but you can also seal it in air-tight containers to keep the moisture away from the cotton candy.

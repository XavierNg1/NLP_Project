 If you choose rice, use raw, uncooked rice. If you choose gravel, choose a size in between sand and pea gravel. You’ll want the gravel/rice to reach all the nooks, crannies, and corners of the bottle.This method is great for irregularly-shaped bottles, as the gravel/rice will reach areas that may otherwise be hard to clean.
Ensure your gravel doesn’t have sharp edges that can scratch the inside of the bottle. If you are concerned about scratches, use rice instead.;
, Any kind of dish soap will work, and you don’t need a lot to get your bottle clean. The soap helps to remove residue from previous beverages as well as dust or dirt.If your bottle isn’t very dirty, you can omit the rice/gravel and simply use the dish soap.
 Fill the rest of the bottle, nearly the top, with water. Hot water works best for removing sticky residue., Be sure to cover the opening of the bottle with your finger or hand so the solution doesn’t spill out. Vigorously shake in every direction; back and forth as well as sideways. Swirl and rotate the soap, water, and gravel/rice around., Dump out the gravel/rice, soap, and water mixture and inspect for any missed pieces of gravel/rice. Repeat the process as needed.Don’t rinse gravel down the drain; be sure to strain it out or pour the contents of the bottle into a bucket or bowl.
 Fill the bottle with clean water and dump it out. Repeat several times. Rinse the mouth of the bottle, paying special attention to the threads, if applicable, and the outside as well. You want to be sure to remove all the gravel/rice and any traces of soap.If you are going to drink from the bottle, wash with an antibacterial soap, or use one or two drops of bleach, and rinse well before refilling.
 Air-drying is likely the easiest way to do this. Begin by setting the bottle upside down on a towel. Prop it up if need be to prevent the bottle from falling and breaking. After a few hours, turn the bottle right-side-up on the towel and allow it to fully dry.

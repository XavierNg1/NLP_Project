 The hot flashes during the menopause are generally caused by the hormones changing in the body and mainly estrogen. Thankfully, there are foods that you can eat to improve these levels of the hormone and balance them out including kidney beans, fresh vegetables and fruits, spices such as cinnamon and sage and even hops. Not only that but chick peas, lentils and garlic can also help to improve these hormone levels and reduce the frequency and intensity of the hot flashes themselves. There were recently a few clinical studies undertaken examining the effects of sage on menopausal women and those that regularly ate sage in their diet showed less hot flashes with the intensity of them reduced at the same time.;
, Most health stores will be able to help you out at this time of life and there are a few vitamins and minerals that you can take to ensure that your menopause is as easy and as pain free as it can be. One of the best that you can take for hot flashes is called evening primrose oil and has proved to be a massive hit for menopausal women over recent years. Not only does evening primrose oil contain essential fatty acids, but it has many other ingredients, as such, to ensure that menopausal symptoms are reduced.
 St. John’s Wort and Vitamin E are also great for hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms. OF course, you can find Vitamin E in many food sources such as rice and nuts as well as egg yolks and this vitamin not only helps with things such as vaginal dryness but also promotes healthy levels of hormone in the body to reduce hot flashes. St. John’s Wort should only really be taken under medical supervision and advice as it can play havoc with other types and kinds of medication that may be taken but it can help to reduce both anxiety and mental issues such as depression, both of which can cause hot flashes during the menopause.

 Use a towel you will not use on the rest of the vehicle. Using a tire towel on the car could result in scratching the clear coat or paint with dirt it picked up on the tire.Dry the sidewalls of the tire completely before moving on.
The treaded portion of the tire is not easy to see or to clean, so focus primarily on the sidewall as it is the most visible.
 Read the ingredient labels when choosing a tire dressing and pick one that does not contain silicone. Choose a water based tire dressing that will not provide as brilliant an immediate shine, but will require less upkeep to maintain. In nearly all applications you should apply the tire dressing evenly in thin coats using the supplied sponge by simply wiping it on as though you are painting the sidewall.You can apply multiple coats of water based tire dressing to achieve the same shine possible from silicone based ones.
Follow the directions on the label for the specific brand of your choice.
Allow tire dressing to dry before driving the vehicle.
 Instead of tire dressing, you may also choose to apply a tire coating that creates a glossy protective layer over the rubber of your tire. Some tire coating is fairly permanent, protecting the rubber for months in even extreme weather. Apply tire coating with the supplied sponge in a thin layer over the entire sidewall.You do not need to apply much tire coating to have a significant effect on the darkness and shine of the tire.
Follow the directions provided with the tire coating you choose carefully for best results.
 Depending on the brand of tire coating you choose, it may take up to an hour for it to dry. Once it has, use the supplied buffing pad or a microfiber towel to buff the tire coating off. Once buffed, the tire will look like a new tire.Buff the tire coating off in a circular motion.
Some tire coating can be buffed immediately after application while others may need to dry completely beforehand. Read the directions on your to be sure.

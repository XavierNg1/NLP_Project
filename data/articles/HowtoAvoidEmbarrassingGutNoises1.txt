 In the short-term, one of the best things you can do to stop the gut-grumbling is to have a small snack. Sometimes, you gut will make noises because you are hungry.


It may seem odd, but your gut is actually most active when it's empty! Food in your system slows the normal movement of your gut, which can cut down on the symphony of gurgles.Avoid going into a meeting, an exam, or a big date on an empty stomach. This may cut down on embarrassing noises.;
, Clean water can also help cut down on the gurgling, if you drink it in moderation.Pair your snack with a small glass of water for best results.


Ideally, the water should be filtered, distilled, boiled, or otherwise purified. Some tap water contains chlorine and/or bacteria that can irritate a sensitive gut.
 On the flip side, don't drink too much water, or any other liquid. This also can produce gurgling sounds as the water moves through your system.This can be especially problematic if you have to be very active. A stomach full of water can make some pretty noisy sounds if you have to move around much.

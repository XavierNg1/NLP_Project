 Cut off the top of the carton. Discard (or recycle) the top.
 Make sure that it is thoroughly dry before using it., The tall sides of the carton will keep it safe and provide plenty of space for your brush to drip the paint down., The benefit of this method is that you only need to carry a small amount at a time rather than lugging about a heavy can of paint and risking knocking over the lot. The milk or juice container is light enough to hold in one hand and paint with the other, which is great when you're standing up a ladder!

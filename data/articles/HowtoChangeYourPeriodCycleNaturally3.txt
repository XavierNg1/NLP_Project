 Try sleeping in total darkness for all but three nights of your cycle. During those three nights, have a light on in the adjoining room to mimic moonlight. According to some, these three nights of light then trigger ovulation, allowing your body to get onto a regular menstrual cycle. Some women have found this to be very effective, but there is no research other than personal stories to support it., It is theorized that the pheromones their bodies release can affect your cycle and trigger your body to menstruate earlier or later. Groups of women living together for months at a time may overlap on their cycles if their cycles last for a similar number of days.Scientific studies have partially debunked this claim, but many women still swear by it., These are hormones that are made to be molecularly identical to the hormones made in a woman's body, though they are instead synthesized from soy and yams.They are often taken to treat menopausal symptoms, but may also help with things like PMS, fibroids, and regulating your period. Talk to your doctor about options for FDA-approved bioidentical drugs and the potential side effects.

Be aware that over-the-counter plant-derived progesterone creams and yam extract creams do not work the same, as they either have too little of the hormone to be effective or cannot be synthesized by the body and converted into progesterone.
Products that are not FDA-approved are not regulated, meaning there is no way to verify that they actually contain what they claim on the bottle.
More research still needs to be done on bioidentical drugs and the long-term risks.
 Stress disrupts the hormonal activity that initiates and sustains your menstrual cycle. Identify the source of the stress and from there you can reduce stress.

 You only visit them for a total of a few minutes each day, it's hard to keep it neat and clean.
 Though you may not have tons of time, take a few minutes during the first week to put up some pictures, neat magnets, or a funky shelf.
 They come fairly cheap (three to five at most department stores), and most can be stacked on top of one another. This frees up a bit of space. Most lockers have a shelf in them already, or if you have a half locker, these are a must have to keep your locker organized.


Luckily, some school have Prep Days, Orientation, or Open House where they let you go to your locker to put up shelves and mirrors so that on the first day of school, you just put away your backpack and binders and go try to find your first class. If they don't come to school early or stay after school. (If your school allows it, you don't want to get in trouble.)

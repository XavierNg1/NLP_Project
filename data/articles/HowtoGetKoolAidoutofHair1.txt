 Even if you wash your hair once every day, it could still take several weeks or even months to get the Kool-Aid out. Try washing your hair a couple of times each day instead. If you wash your hair more frequently, though, you should use normal shampoos or moisturizing formulas to prevent your hair from drying out too much.;
, If you only wash your hair once every day or less, try a clarifying shampoo. These shampoos are formulated to strip your hair of foreign build-up, including hair dyes like Kool-Aid. It will not remove the Kool-Aid immediately, but a clarifying shampoo will help fade it faster. Most importantly, the majority of clarifying shampoos are approved for daily use.
 Anti-dandruff shampoos are similar to clarifying shampoos in the way that they strip the hair of chemicals and possible irritants. To increase the effectiveness of an anti-dandruff shampoo against Kool-Aid, mix it with a little baking soda and apply it to wet hair. You may need to do this several times, but it should help to fade the dye much faster than normal shampoo.
 Laundry detergent and dish soap can both remove hair dye, including Kool-Aid, but they also have the potential to severely dry out and damage hair, so they should be used sparingly. If you use a laundry detergent, select a mild, dye-free formula that does not use any bleach and only apply a small amount. When using dish soap, select a mild, fragrance-free and dye-free formula and only use three to four drops. Thoroughly rinse either soap out of your hair immediately.

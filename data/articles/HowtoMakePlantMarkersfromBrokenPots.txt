 This will help you to gain an idea of how many markers to make. Typically you’ll need a bit of space so you can surround the planted greenery with the pot, however you could trim a potted plant in a smaller garden using a smaller size.;
, A tape measure is handy but even eyeballing the area to determine the pot size will work well too.
 Since each plant may take up a different amount of space, you'll want to customize the marker for each plant’s size.
 Make sure it's written clearly so that you can read the name.


Consider using a stencil to create uniformity. This takes more effort but might be best for a showpiece area of your garden, such as an herb garden or a special vegetable plot.
Allow time for the writing on the pot piece to dry before adding it to the plant area.
 Try a few positions before deciding where it sits best (don’t embed the pot deeply into the soil until you are sure you like the location). Done!

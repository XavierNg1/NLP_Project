You could also use nail polish remover. Acetone-based removers are especially effective, but acetone is a harsh, abrasive cleaner, so you should not use this if you have sensitive skin or if you are getting paint off your face or neck.
You could use a cotton rag, too, but disposable cotton pads are preferred.
If you have makeup wipes, these can be used in place of the liquid remover and cotton.
Makeup remover is designed to lift out stubborn dyes and oils from your skin, so it can be effective against spray paint.
 Thoroughly rub the cotton pad with the makeup remover on it over the skin covered by spray paint. Use firm pressure, but do not rub your skin raw.









Most of the paint should lift up and into the cotton pad directly. You can rinse your skin when done, but any paint that will come off will likely come off into the cotton.
 If some of the paint has still stubbornly stuck onto your skin, you could try another method or repeat this one a few more times. After a few disposable cotton pads soaked in makeup remover, most if not all of the spray paint should wipe away.

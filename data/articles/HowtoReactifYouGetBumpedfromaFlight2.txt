 The gate agent is usually the person who will re-book your flight and offer you compensation if you qualify for it. You may also be redirected to a customer service counter to receive your compensation and to re-book your flight.You can also call the airlineâ€™s 1-800 number. However, be aware that it may take awhile for you to re-book your flight and receive compensation if you do this.
 This is usually done automatically when your flight is re-booked. However, make sure to confirm the new flight with the gate agent. Also make sure your itinerary is updated if you are taking a later flight.If there is another seat on a similar flight, make sure it is a confirmed seat as opposed to a standby seat. If it is a standby seat, you may end up stranded.
Inquire about how your checked-in luggage will be handled or transferred.
 If you qualify for compensation, make sure to ask for it in the form of a check or cash as opposed to a voucher or a free flight. While it may be tempting to accept vouchers and free flights, they are often subjected to restrictions and limitations.The amount of compensation you receive depends on the length of the delay, the amount you paid for the ticket, and the person that makes the alternative travel arrangements.
Be aware that being bumped due to safety-related balance or weight concerns, or because the airline switched to a smaller plane, will disqualify you from compensation.
 Passengers who have a long layover or who have to spend the night due to a flight change are entitled to hotel and transportation vouchers. Even if you will only be stuck at the airport for a few hours, make sure to ask what type of vouchers you qualify for like food vouchers.

 If you want to keep the dog away from the trash can, keep it away from the dog. Put it under the sink where a dog can't get at it, or in a side room or closet that you can keep closed. If you have a very small dog, put the can up higher on a stool. If your dog is large, put the can in an alternative location, such as:


Coat closet.
Washing room.
Front room or mud room.
Garage.
Outside.
 If you have a really big dog, it's sometimes necessary to fix the garbage can to the wall so the can can't be knocked over. Use a sturdy metal can and fix it to a beam in a fixture or a wall in an appropriate location.


Sometimes, it's helpful to do this in an out-of-the-way location, since it looks kind of weird to have an unmovable garbage can in the middle of your kitchen.
Put it in a closet adjacent to your kitchen.
 A smelly garbage can with lots of food in it is going to tempt even well-trained dogs. Take your garbage out as soon as the can gets full, instead of letting the can sit and stuffing the trash down.


Consider taking things such as meat wrappers, leftovers and other pieces of garbage with very attractive scents immediately to the garbage bin outside, instead of putting them in the kitchen trash can.
 Some bigger dogs are just good at getting into trash cans, even if the dogs are well-trained and even if you take good care of your garbage. If you fear that your dog might consume something that will harm it, dispose of those materials properly.


Batteries, paint, oils and other nasty substances should always be taken directly to collection points. Read this article to find out more about getting rid of toxic substances.

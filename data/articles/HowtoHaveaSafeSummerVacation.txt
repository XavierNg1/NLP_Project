 It is a good idea to keep a kit in each car that you drive, and of course on for the home, possibly even one on each level of the house! Make sure that you have bandages, gauze tape, hydrogen peroxide or iodine, burn cream or spray, calamine lotion, and tweezers in your kit. This should come in handy for any minor scrapes, burns, rashes or splinters that could happen at any time!;
, The sun is stronger than ever, and every day that you are outside should be a day that you apply sun block. The minimum protection level should be 15 SPF, and better yet use 50 SPF if you are at the pool or beach. Try to limit your time in the sun, too. If you are at a picnic or a pool party, try to get into the shade for some of the time and drink lots of water or lemonade.
 This is very important. Hot weather will cause dehydration, and that is a trip to the emergency room if it gets out of hand. Try to drink at least eight glasses of water a day. Water is always a better choice than sugary drinks that have a lot of sodium and calories

, Just because it is summer does not mean that you should try skydiving or cliff jumping. If you are not already involved in these types of activities, it's recommended to trying them. Stick to what you know, and you have a better chance of not getting hurt this summer.
 If you are familiar with a place and have done research, you have a better chance of not ending up in the wrong part of a town that you don't know.
 Keep your children and belongings close at hand to avoid any unpleasant endings to an otherwise fun occasion. Always have a safe place to meet if you get separated from your group.
 The neighbor does not need to go in your house unless they are watching an animal or bringing in your mail. Call and check up during the vacation if you feel the need.

 Use sharp pruners to make a nice, even cut. Leave 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of stem attached to each gourd. Leaving this bit of stem is important because it helps with the evaporation of water. The skin of the gourd is hard and non-porous, so the porous stem is necessary to let moisture escape from the gourd.


If you have gourds that are considered immature (it is fleshy and bright green) and are concerned that the first frost will kill them, cut them from the vine and use them as temporary decorations. You generally will not be able to dry these gourds. You can also leave them on the vine--occasionally they will be hardened by the frost rather than killed., Doing this removes bacteria and helps prevent rotting.


You can also soak them for 20 minutes in a solution of one part household bleach and nine parts warm water.
 This will get rid of any residual soap or bleach.
 The gourds can dry in a cold location, but keep in mind that repetitive freezing and thawing can often damage the seeds inside the gourds. In turn, damage to the seeds will make it so that the seeds cannot be replanted.You can also dry gourds in a garage, barn or inside of the house, but they will get the best air circulation if you allow them to dry outside. It may take several months for the gourds to dry fully. Keep in mind that large quantities of drying gourds give off an unpleasant odor. If you dry them inside your home, it will take some time to get rid of the smell.
 The surface should be a structure like a wood pallet. Elevating the platform allows for increased air circulation--the air will be able to circulate around them from every direction.
 Depending on the size of the gourd, it could take from six weeks to a whole year to dry fully., Use the dull side of a butter knife to scrape the mould off. You can also wash mould off with a rag. If a gourd becomes soft, you will have to throw it out.
 Turn the gourds over once every 1 to 2 weeks to expose the bottom to air.

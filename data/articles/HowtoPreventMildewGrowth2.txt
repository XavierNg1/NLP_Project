 Air flow will help deter mildew by preventing locations from becoming stale and musty.


Allow natural wind breezes to enter the room or area and use a fan.
 The added heat will aid in reducing moisture.


Use a heater for a short period (only long enough to allow for drying damp or wet areas) and then air the area out with a fan.
Leave a 100-watt bulb burning in a small area to add heat.
 Mildew thrives in warm and damp places.


Cool down the air to keep the moisture out of it once the dampness is dried with heat.

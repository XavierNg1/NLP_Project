 The goal is to raise the signatures above the level of your table so that they are easier to glue. You can also use a wooden block or other thick, sturdy material if a textbook is not available. Place your signatures so that ¼ of an inch overhangs the spine of the textbook underneath; be careful not to bump the signatures so that they fall out of line.
 To keep the pages from moving around, add several more textbooks or other heavy, flat items on top of your signatures. This will also help to provide a sturdy spine for the glue. Again, be careful not to move the pieces around too much or bump them out of alignment.
 Use PVA (PVAC)glue to stick your pages together. Using other glues such as regular white school glue, hot glue, super glue, or rubber cement won’t allow your pages much flexibility and will crack over time. Use a regular paintbrush to apply a coat of the glue to the entire spine, being careful not to get any on either the front or back pages. Wait 15 minutes, and then add another coat of glue. You will need to add 5 layers of glue total, with a period of waiting in between each.
 This is a flexible fabric-like tape used for binding books that goes on both the top and the bottom of the spine. It adds extra reinforcement, and prevents the back of the spine from being pulled away from the signatures. Cut a small piece (shorter than ½ inch) and attach it to the top and bottom of your signatures near the spine.

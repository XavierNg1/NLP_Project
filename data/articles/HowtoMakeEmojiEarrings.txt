 For this project you will need a pack of emoji stickers, scissors, a sewing needle, a file folder, and two matching stud earrings (with backs).;
, Then, rip a piece of the file folder off. When you've done this, stick your emoji stickers on the piece of the file folder.
 Carefully cut around all the details of the sticker, and be sure not to cut the sticker itself. Leave a little space at the top of your sticker where the earring will go.
 Do this with both emoji stickers.
 They should fit inside and be stopped by the gem or bead at the end of the stud earring. Insert into your ear, fasten with the earring back and then you're done!

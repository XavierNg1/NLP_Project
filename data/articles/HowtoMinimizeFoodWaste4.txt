 Knowing how to arrange your refrigerator will help your groceries last longer because the various areas in the fridge are different temperatures and some groceries need to be colder than others. This practice will also minimize food waste. Dairy products should be stored at the top of the refrigerator, where it is coolest.
Store meat and fish on the shelf or shelves in the middle tier(s).
Place cheese and cold cuts in the first drawer below the bottom shelf.
Store produce and fruit in the bottom drawer or a bottom drawer that is humidity-controlled, if applicable.
Store eggs and butter in a compartment protected by a cover in the door of the refrigerator. This prevents them from getting too cold.
Place sauces and dressings in the middle compartments of the refrigerator door.
 Certain vegetables do best outside of the refrigerator and some should be refrigerated immediately after purchasing.Store garlic in an area that is dry and well-ventilated.
Keep onions and potatoes separated, as they cause each other to spoil faster.
Store sweet potatoes in a place that shields them from heat and light.
Most other vegetables should be refrigerated.
 Most fruit needs to ripen or soften at room temperature before refrigerating, and certain fruits should be stored in the refrigerator immediately after purchasing. Still others can be stored at room temperature without fear of spoiling too quickly.Bananas, honeydew melons, kiwi fruit, mangos, nectarines, pineapples, etc. need to ripen at room temperature before refrigeration, or else they can lose flavor.
Most berries need to be refrigerated immediately after purchasing. Leaving them at room temperature will increase the rate of decay.
Apples, many citrus fruits, and watermelon can be stored at room temperature. However, they will generally last longer if refrigerated.

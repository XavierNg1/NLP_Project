 Failure to maintain good oral hygiene is a primary cause of tonsil stones. Brushing your teeth in the morning, before bedtime, and after every meal is the foundation of healthy oral hygiene and first step in preventing tonsil stones. This will help eliminate food particles and bacteria that can collect in your tonsils’ nooks and crannies.Remember to brush your tongue as well, since it can harbor easy to miss bacteria, mucus, and food residue.;
, Flossing daily can help prevent tonsil stones by eliminating tartar and plaque buildup. Tonsil stones are similar in composition and structure to the biofilm that forms between your teeth, and both can cause prolonged bad breath.So, if you’re trying to prevent tonsil stones in order to deal with bad breath, it’s important to eliminate that same bio-matter where it forms elsewhere in your mouth.
 Mouthwashes that contain alcohol can lead to dry mouth, which increases the risk for bacteria buildup and tonsil stones. Go with a brand that is alcohol free, and use it at least once a day. Alternatively, gargle with a salt and warm water rinse.Gargling with saltwater can also help ease any discomfort caused by tonsillitis, or infection of the tonsils, which can accompany tonsil stones., If you notice tonsil stones forming, remove them in order to keep from becoming sources of further discomfort, bad breath, or infection. Wet both ends of a cotton swab, and gently massage your tonsils to free up the stones. Gargle afterwards to remove any leftover particles.If you have a low-pressure oral water irrigator, you can use it weekly to wash away any particles that might get caught in your tonsils’ folds.

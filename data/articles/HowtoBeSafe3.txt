 Never use obvious passwords like "password" or "12345"." Password crackers can get past these types of common passwords quickly and effectively, making them as useless as having no password at all. Choose secure passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and special symbols for the best password.
 Always log out of any website that requires you to log in. This includes email sites, social networking, and other sites you wouldn't want messed with. This is especially true on public computers, but it's a good idea to do it on your personal computer as well, to be safe.
 Never give out identifiable information such as your full name, address, phone number, email, or credit card number anywhere on the Internet, whether in a chat room or on Twitter or Facebook.


Control your privacy settings so that absolutely nothing that you post is public to anyone who you've haven't approved. Going to the effort to restrict everything so that can keep prying eyes away from your posts and pictures is worth it to feel safe.
If a stranger asks for personal information, tell them, "There are some things best left unsaid on the Internet."

, Before you sign up to any site, read the terms and conditions, and read all of the fine print to make sure that you're not agreeing to any terms you're not aware of. It may be tedious, but it's worth the extra measure of safety.

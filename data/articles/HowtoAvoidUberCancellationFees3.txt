 If you believe you've been charged a fee unfairly, the easiest way to dispute the fee is to do so directly through the Uber app. Open the Uber app an then hit the menu item. From there, click "I had an issue with my fare." When the next menu opens, click, "I was charged a cancellation fee." You will then be prompted to provide the details of how you were charged the fee.Usually, you can get your money back if a driver issue caused a cancellation. For example, if a driver was very late and didn't return your calls, you may have been forced to cancel the ride after five minutes. In this case, Uber may refund you the money as the driver was to blame for the issue.
Remember, Uber does reserve the right to charge fees if you cancelled the ride after five minutes or made your driver wait an unreasonable time. Under these circumstances, Uber may not refund you.
 If you receive a receipt e-mail from Uber for a cancellation fee, you can reply directly to that e-mail to dispute the fee. You can simply hit "reply" and explain why you feel you were charged unfairly. This can be easier as it requires less steps that disputing your fee via the app., If you click on the help tab of the Uber website, you can dispute a fee there. You will have to sign into the app and then follow the prompts from there. Eventually, you should be able to send Uber a message explaining the issue and requesting your money back.

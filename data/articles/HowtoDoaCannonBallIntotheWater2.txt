, (Don't do this if you're on a diving board). If you're too close to the water when you jump, you won't get enough power, and you'll make a smaller splash. On the other hand, if you are like 10 steps away from the water's edge, all your power is going to be wasted in running to the pool, not in jumping in.
 If you have to stop in the middle of your dive for air, you will decrease the splash.
 You'll only have to run for about half a second.
 However, if you want a huge splash, you've got to do more than just jump randomly. You've got to put pressure into your legs. Think to yourself while you're jumping, "force those legs into the water!" Use all the power your body can muster up. Use that power to force your body down into the water.


Pretend your legs are weights, and your body hurts and aches every second those weights are attached to your body. Those weights are heavy, and they practically force you to put pressure on your body. Sum this up as "pressure, force and power".
 Staying underwater impresses whoever is judging the contest because they'll think that you dove so hard that you got so deep into the water that it takes you a minute to swim back up to the surface. Unless, of course, there are judges underwater, in which case, go up as fast as possible.
 When you do get up to the surface, act like you're tired and worn out from the big jump, but also very proud of your work. This always impresses others observing.

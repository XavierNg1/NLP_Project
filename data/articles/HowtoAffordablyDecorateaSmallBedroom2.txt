 The lighting in a bedroom can make a huge difference in how small or large it feels and whether or not it comes off as "polished." To create a relaxing, comfortable bedroom in which you actually want to spend downtime, try making these changes:


Use minimal window coverings. Avoid having blinds, which block out too much light and make a room feel closed-in even when they're open. Go for breezy, light curtains in a neutral color instead. Hanging them a few inches above the top of the window can make the windows look bigger and increase the perceived scale of the room.Choose a bright table or floor lamp. Overhead lights seem to spotlight the flaws in a room, making it feel cramped and uncomfortable. It's worth buying a floor lamp or side table lamp bright enough to light the whole room instead.
 Light, natural hues like white, cream, pale yellow, pale blue, or another neutral shade will help make the room look bigger and brighter. Choose a color that doesn't contrast too much with the shade of your floor. Paint the ceiling white as well.


If you love bold colors, consider painting the walls a neutral color and using a bolder trim. You could also paint just one wall in a bold color (or paper it with a brightly patterned wallpaper) and paint the other walls a lighter color.
Consider adding color and interest by making a stenciled border around the perimeter of the room. You may not even need wall art if you go this route.
 You might be attracted to a duvet cover with a bright floral pattern, but in a small bedroom it will draw the eye and stick out from its surroundings. A better approach would be to get a bed covering in a more neutral hue and add throw pillows in bright contrasting colors for a decorative touch.


You could also add some color by choosing sheets with a fun pattern and making your bed so that the sheets are folded over the top of your neutral-colored comforter.
Choose linens that aren't too frilly or bulky, since these take up more space.

, See How to make salt dough for details.


Color some of the salt dough yellow or brown, for the nest.






Color the remaining salt dough the color that you'd like the eggs to be. If you want more than one color of egg, divide the salt dough up and dye each portion a different color.
 These will be turned into the nest.
, Using the colored dough pieces, roll the salt dough into egg shapes. Try to keep each one small and evenly shaped. They should all be of the same or similar size.
 Adhere to the base of the nest.
 Once dried, the nest can be placed into a display.


If liked, attach a small twig to one side of the nest and stick a model robin to it. If you cannot find a model robin, fashion one from an image stuck to cardboard and glue this upright to the twig.

 Taping your foot to treat plantar fasciitis can reduce the pain associated with plantar fasciitis. It helps support your foot when you engage in physical activity to reduce strain.It can also help minimize stress and inflammation.


Keeping your foot stretched helps your foot loosen and heal in an elongated position so it doesnâ€™t shorten during the night. The main goal in taping your foot is to keep the foot flexed, with the toes pointing or pulled toward your head, until you feel a stretch in the bottom of your foot. Make sure you only feel a gentle stretch in your foot.
 You may start seeing symptoms when you feel pain under your heel or in the arch of your foot. This often occurs when you stand up in the morning or after resting your feet for an extended period of time.After some time walking, the pain decreases.


Pain may be felt after long periods of standing, physical activity, running, or sitting. Many times, the pain is felt while exercising.
The pain is usually described as stabbing, but it can also be described as aching or burning., The plantar fascia bears all our weight and has been described as a sort of bowstring supporting the arch of the foot. Anything that causes increased strain on this area of the foot can cause plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis may occur when the plantar fascia tightens, shortens, or becomes inflamed.Causes include:Obesity
Footwear that does not support the arch adequately or fits improperly
Overload because of physical activity, such as running, jumping, or jogging
Arthritis
Diabetes
Existing foot problems, such as flat feet or high arches
Abnormal gait and way of walking
Overtraining

 Not for the fame, but because you have a true, and strong passion for music! It's going to take a lot of hard work. Don't just do it for money or to show off.;
, It does not matter how naturally talented or terrible you might be; lessons will teach you a lot and help you improve your voice.
 If you choose the wrong band mates that can lead to serious issues down the road.
, (2) If there are any business near by that have open mic nights, go for that. (3) If your lucky and live in a bigger city you can just perform on the street, or maybe a concert venue.
 This might not really work as well if you live in a smaller town. Become friends with people at concert venues, you might end up opening for another 'bigger' band, and could make even more connections.
 You can even use a program called Garage-band on a MAC.
 Tell friends and family members, make fliers for upcoming gigs, make a Myspace, a Facebook, a twitter, a live journal, and a YouTube account anything that can reach a lot of people upload your music and attempt to add as many people as possible!

, Don't get discouraged if/when you are rejected, keep trying! And remember record labels DO NOT want to hear something that's already been done, be original.
 Keep playing shows (tour if possible), promoting yourself, sending out demos, and making your fan base grow! Labels like to see that you are taking the initiative.
 Fight for your creative vision because if you don't, well that's just not good..

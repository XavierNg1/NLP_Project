 The main way most people go wrong with their kitchens is in not choosing a theme. They have a vision here and a vision there (or they pick up knickknacks as they find them) and conflate them together into one hodgepodge of a kitchen. Pick a theme and you've tackled 80% of the battle.


It's important that your kitchen decorating be cohesive and make the room look pulled together. Accomplish this by deciding on one theme for your kitchen and choosing decorations that match it. Some home improvement stores have entire sets of kitchen decorations based on themes like country living, French or art deco styles.
 If you love sleek, shiny things, a super modern kitchen may be your style. Think in harsh angles and blacks, whites, and popping, bright colors. Most metallic, stainless steel, and geometric art pieces would adorn this kitchen. Glass, too!

, A common (but still classy) theme to choose is a sea theme. Whether you live on the ocean or want to bring the ocean to you, this theme is cozy and inviting.


Line your shelves with seashells, sailor's gear, and scenes from the beach. Work in elements of tan, cream, and blues. What a great excuse to make a DIY project with rope, netting, and items from the beach!

, If you are fond of dark, warm colors, an earthy, natural, woodsy theme may be more up your alley. Think of dark cabinets, wooden dishware, bowls of potpourri, cherry reds, rich mahoganies, and dark oranges.
 If an outright themed design is too much for your sensibilities, just go for a color. Hues can line up a kitchen, too! Blue stools, blue dishes, blue cabinet pulls -- everything will be brought together regardless of your items' designs. Just make sure you don't get sick of it!


This theme is a bit dangerous. Too much of one tone can be overkill. However, if you do not have the authority to revamp your kitchen (if renting), incorporating color as your theme may be the best way to go.

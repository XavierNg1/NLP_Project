 Brown suits should be paired with either brown or burgundy shoes. However, the particular shade of the shoes is important. There needs to be a distinct contrast between the color of your shoes and the color of your suit.In general, look for a shade of brown or deep red that is darker than the color of your suit.
Avoid pairing black shoes with a brown suit.
 This is one of the most well-known rules in suit fashion. It’s hard to beat a pair of rich mahogany wing-tips with a belt made from matching leather. Slight variations are acceptable, but wearing shoes and a belt of significantly different colors risks looking youthful or sloppy., If you’re planning to wear a pocket square with a brown suit, use it to compliment your tie, but don’t match it exactly. A well-chosen pocket square can make an outfit, especially if you’re able to complement colors from several other items.For instance, if you’re wearing a deep red tie on a white shirt, try a yellow pocket square to make your suit pop and provide contrast to the color of your tie.

 If so, you may already have the first three lines done! Let's say your haiku is:






ever ascending
the mountain road disappears
into pallid clouds





, For our example, note that in many cultures, especially Asian cultures, white can symbolise death (already hinted at by the word "pallid"). Let's work with that and add the closing couplet:






I think of you as blossoms
too soon tossed on winding roads





, The poem has gone from a picture of mountain roads (note how the road links the first and second parts, though in your poem the link can certainly be a subtle one) to an expression of loss for which there is no exact word. However, the shift may not always be so obvious.

 Make an appointment with your general practitioner or an endocrinologist. They will likely run a series of blood tests to determine if you are GH deficient. Sometimes low GH levels can be connected with other conditions as well, such as Turner Syndrome. Your doctor can also discuss possible safe treatment and care options with you., GH injections are available by prescription if you are diagnosed by a doctor. They are given via a pen-like device and are relatively pain free. The injections are usually given around bedtime and are usually successful at boosting the production of GH overnight. Injections may be combined with oral supplements as part of a larger GH therapy program.Be aware that GH injections provided outside of a doctorâ€™s prescription are illegal and highly dangerous., You can also take supplements as part of a broader hormonal therapy program. You will want to discuss this with your doctor and they can either write you a prescription or direct you toward certain brands. Some amino acid supplements, such as arginine, come in an oral form. You may need to take a higher dose in order to see results, so make sure to consult with a doctor for safety.For example, a sample dosage of arginine could be between five to nine grams after each work-out session., There is no one pill that is an immediate HGH cure-all. The same goes for any creams advertised as an instant GH boost. Creams are considered only minimally effective at boosting GH. When in doubt, talk with your doctor about any treatments and verify that they are medically sound before proceeding.

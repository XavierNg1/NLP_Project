 You’ll want to wash your bag in cool to cold water. Set your washing machine’s water temperature to the coolest setting it has. This prevents any stains from setting while your bag is washed., You can use the detergent you normally use for clothes for cleaning your nylon bag. This could be powdered detergent, liquid detergent, or detergent pods. You should use about half of the normal amount of detergent you would use when washing a small load of laundry., You don’t need to set the washer to a gentle cycle for nylon bags. Use the same settings you would use for your more durable clothing – jeans or t-shirts., Nylon is pretty water-resistant, and the spin cycle of your washing machine should wick most of the extra moisture off. If the bag has fabric – not nylon – straps, those will need to air dry.

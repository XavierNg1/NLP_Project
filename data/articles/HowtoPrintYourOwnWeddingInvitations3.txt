 Traditional invitations include several enclosures (often called an invitation suite), including a wedding invitation, reception invitation and response card. Traditional invitations are printed on high quality paper and are ideal for formal weddings.
 Casual invitations may not include as many enclosures, and may direct guests to a website for additional information about the wedding. Casual invitations are ideal for a themed wedding or a less formal event. Casual invitations may feature embellishments and distinct paper designs.

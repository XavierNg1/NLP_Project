 When your teen notices any signs or symptoms of an oncoming attack, they should tell someone that a flare-up is about to happen, or let people around them know what is going on. Advise them to sit down and take slow, steady breaths.Symptoms of an oncoming attack are a cough, breathlessness, wheezing, tightening of the chest, difficulty speaking or eating, and increased or rapid breathing.
For example, if they are at school, tell them to let their friends, teachers, coaches and/or school nurse know what is going on. Make sure the school nurse has your child's action plan on record and an extra rescue inhaler.
 Have them revert immediately to their action plan. Remind them to remain calm and follow the action planâ€™s protocol.To help your teen act swiftly in a situation, do practice runs at home. Practice for each asthma zone, i.e., the green, yellow, and red zones. Practicing at home will help your teen feel confident that they can control and prevent a full attack even if they do not have their action plan with them.
 If they can figure out what triggered the attack, then encourage them to remove the trigger, or remove themselves from the area. Remind them to not ignore a flare-up in hopes that it will go away on its own. It needs to be dealt with promptly in order to prevent an emergency situation.Advise them to call an ambulance (911) if they don't have their inhaler or medication with them, if their symptoms do not improve after 10 puffs, if they feel worse despite using their inhaler, or if they are worried at any point.If the ambulance takes longer than 15 minutes, then have them repeat step two.

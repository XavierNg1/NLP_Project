 If you can't find someone in person, try looking online. There are many communities online where people from all over the world gather to learn Japanese.;
, Try to engage in actually speaking the language if possible. If you are doing this online, there are several voice chat programs out there that will help you communicate freely over the internet. You should ask other people online which programs will work best for them.
 You should pay close attention to the differences between the language when spoken by different genders. Some words and phrases may be different.
, One of the keys to learning a language is learning what mistakes can be made so that you don't make them in the future.
 Learn about Japanese popular culture- singers, books, anything. Studio Ghibli movies such as Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away are good. This is where a little knowledge of Japanese culture goes a long way. Of course, cultural differences are fine, but they may end up a monologue if the conversation partner isn't really interested.
 There are a lot of stock and predictable questions- be ready not only to answer, but to elaborate. This will not improve speaking skills, but it will facilitate ease of conversation.
, Shadowing is a technique where you listen to someone speaking the target language and then repeat what they said aloud as clearly as you can. Don't worry about repeating things perfectly, just try to repeat as much as you can as quickly and clearly as you can.

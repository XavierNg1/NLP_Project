 If you want to apply in-store but don't know where the nearest location is, you can find out online. Simply go to the Best Buy website and navigate your cursor to the upper right-hand corner of the web page. Click on the Store Locator tab and enter your ZIP code or city and state to find locations near you., The in-store application will ask for the same information as the online application. You'll need to provide your name and address, contact information, and basic financial information for the store to determine whether you will qualify for a credit card.


The in-store application may take a bit longer, as the store will have to cross-check your paper application with online credit reports and confirm your identity. Otherwise, the two applications will be essentially the same. It's mostly a matter of preference between applying online or in store.
 As part of the application, you'll be asked to choose which type of card you are interested in. Just as with the online application, both the My Best Buy credit card (store card) and the Best Buy Visa card offer the same in-store rewards., If you are approved for a Best Buy credit card, it will be sent through the mail. Just like the online application process, a card offered after an in-store application will most likely arrive within seven to 14 days of the application's approval.

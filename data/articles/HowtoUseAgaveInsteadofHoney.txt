While honey has a unique taste and imparts its flavor to the food that is being sweetened, agave has a subtler flavor and lends little or no taste to a dish or beverage.
Agave tastes sweeter than honey because of higher fructose content.
Honey is not recommended for children under the age of 1 due to the presence of a few botulism spores. Agave may be consumed by people of all ages.

Agave is great for adding body fat because of the high fructose content.
, Since agave browns more quickly than honey, you don't want the food to pick up a burnt taste or turn an unappetizing color.
, Honey will solidify in cold liquids, while agave will not. Agave can also be used to sweeten iced tea by drizzling the desired amount into the beverage and stirring.;
,, Experiment until the desired sweetness is reached. If honey is called for in a cold salad recipe, start by replacing half the recommended amount with agave and add as needed.

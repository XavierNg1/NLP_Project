 Every boss is different. Ask your boss if he or she prefers to keep in touch through face-to-face meetings, email, text, phone, or maybe Skype., If you have a quick question can you just walk into your bossâ€™s office and ask or do you need to make an appointment? The communication protocol is specific to your boss. Ask your boss, his or her secretary, or a co-worker if your communication relationship is supposed to be formal or informal.


Always be respectful and professional even if you have an informal communication relationship with your boss.
 Find out if your boss wants updates multiple times throughout the day, at a certain time each day, once a week, or through scheduled meetings., Right away, you and your boss need to discuss your job specifications and what is expected of you. It is when this information is unclear or unspoken that conflict and disappointment arise.

 Look for growers and manufacturers of honey that state it is raw or un-pasteurized. Keep in mind that many online merchants will state that their honey is 100 percent natural, which may mean that it has actually been heated up to temperatures of 120 degrees F (48.8 C). For completely raw honey, check labels carefully, and make sure there is a money back guarantee in case you are dissatisfied. Shop for websites that are as close to your region as possible.

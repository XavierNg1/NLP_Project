 Place it in a small plastic heat-resistant bowl. Place the bowl into a saucepan partially filled with water. Place the saucepan on the stove and heat gently. Stir the chocolate regularly with a wooden spoon. Remove from the heat once melted.
 You can do this in one of two ways:

Place chunks of banana into the bowl in which you have melted the chocolate. Gently stir the mixture until all the banana pieces are coated. Scoop the banana chunks out onto a grease proof-paper lined plate (or chopping board) while the chocolate is still warm. Use a wooden spoon to separate the banana chunks to prevent them sticking together as the chocolate cools.
Lay the bananas out on a lined plate, board or rack. Use a spoon to drizzle or pour the melted chocolate over the bananas. Make sure that banana is completely covered with chocolate.
 Add the nuts immediately after putting the chocolate covered chunks onto the plate, or after covering the banana in molten chocolate. If the chocolate begins to cool, it will start to set and the crushed nuts won't stick as well to it.,, Plate them and serve.

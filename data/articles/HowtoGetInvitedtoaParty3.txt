 The kind of party being thrown will dictate the things that need to be available for the party to be a success! A dance party isn't much of a dance party without music, a wine tasting party could benefit from an intriguing vintage, and almost every large party needs ice at some point.


By anticipating needs, you can prove to the host that you'd be a welcome addition to the party crew., There are cost effective ways of doing this, like making a dish to pass, or bringing suitable beverages. Think carefully about what you can bring to make the party even better, or bring a specific gift for the host that takes her tastes into consideration. For example, you might:


Bring seasonal gifts, like a plastic pumpkin of Halloween candy, eggnog, winter themed treats, or cold drinks in the summer.
Give a mixology set as a present for when the party gets started, but only if age appropriate.
A dish to pass or snacks to contribute., Now that you've figured out a worthwhile contribution, bring it up to the party host or organizers. For instance, if you have a delicious recipe for chocolate chip cookies, you can simply say something like:"Emily, I heard about your party. Sound super fun! If you need any dessert, I make killer chocolate chip cookies - my grandmother's recipe. Everybody love them!"
"So what are your plans for the weekend? Oh, a party? Well, if you need dessert, I have the best recipe for homemade chocolate chip cookies.", If your offer matches the needs of the party or the tastes of the host, you'll almost certainly be invited! This scenario has the added benefit of not only getting you legitimately invited to the party, but you'll also be appreciated for your contribution to it!


There's always a possibility, whether due to your associations or the hosts perceptions, that you might be denied. Getting angry in this situation rarely does anything positive for your reputation. Be polite and have fun on your own.

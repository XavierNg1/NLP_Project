Most freshly sprouted weeds can be hand-pulled.
Tough weeds, such as Dandelions, will require your weeding tool or any long, narrow garden tool you have on hand.
If you don’t dig out the entire Dandelion root, it will quickly grow back, so dig deep and get it all out at once.
 Even weeds with an annual life-cycle can produce thousands of seeds in one season. The wind will scatter the seeds all over your property and create countless hours of work for you.


If you don’t have time to dig out a weed that is on the brink of going to seed, at least pull the top of it off and dispose of it.
For Dandelion and other wispy, delicate seeds, use one hand to slip a paper bag over the top of the seed head and snap the plant stem with your other hand, keeping the seed head inside the bag so the wind doesn’t scatter the seeds.

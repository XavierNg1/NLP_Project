 Bookshelves can be found anywhere in Skyrim even under dungeons and underground dwellings, but you can easily find one inside houses. Look for a bookshelf that doesn’t have any book placed in it.;
, Approach the bookshelf and press the interaction button on your controller or keyboard as prompted on the game screen. The Bookshelf menu will open on the left side of your screen, showing both the books on the bookshelf (upper portion of the menu) and the ones in your inventory (lower part). Since there are no books on the shelf, the former should show no item.
 After selecting the book you want to duplicate, press the “Store” button on your controller, and the book will be placed inside the bookshelf. You’ll see that the book has been physically stored there.


Place the book on the shelf, but DO NOT exit the Bookshelf menu; otherwise, the trick won’t work.
 Without exiting the Bookshelf menu, quickly press the “Take” button several times while you’re taking the book and placing it back into your inventory (you need to quickly press the “Take” button multiple times to make this method work).
 Once you’ve removed the book from the shelf (still without leaving the Bookshelf menu), scroll down the menu and check your book inventory. You should now have two copies of the book you’ve just placed and took out of the shelf.

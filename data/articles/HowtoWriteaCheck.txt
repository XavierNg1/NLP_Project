 There will be a blank space next to or above the word "Date." Remember that a check is a legal document, and the date written here should always be the day that you sign the bottom of the check.
 Write the name of the person or company you're sending the check to next to the line that says "Pay to the Order of." If it's a company and you're not sure exactly what it's called, make sure you get that information right before you write the check. You can also just pay the check to "Cash," but be careful, because that means that anyone can cash it.

If it's to an individual, include both their first and last names. If they are a 'Jr.' or a 'Sr.' you should include this as well.
If the check is going to an organization, write out its full name. Do not use acronyms unless explicitly given permission.
 Write the exact amount, using dollars and cents. If the check is for twenty dollars, write "20.00."
, Make sure you also express the amount of cents if there are cents, or write "even" at the end of the amount so that another person doesn't add more money to the amount. If you've written a check for $20.00, write either "Twenty dollars and 0/100 cents," "Twenty dollars even," or just "Twenty" with a line running all the way from the right of the word to the end of the line.
 Your check will be invalid if it is not personally signed.
 Though this part of the check is optional, it can be helpful to write a note to yourself or the recipient to remember what the check is for. You can write "For May rent" if you're sending a rent check. Also, many companies or landlords require that you provide some other information in the memo section; some companies require you to write your ID number in the "Memo" section, and if you're writing a rent check for your apartment, you should write the apartment # right in the memo section.

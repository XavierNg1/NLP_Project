 Prepare a 9-inch by 13-inch (23-cm by 33-cm) baking pan by coating it with nonstick cooking spray.;
,, Add them slowly and carefully with minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Toss the tomatoes gently so that they are thoroughly coated in the olive oil and seasonings.
, Cook the tomatoes in the preheated oven for 60 minutes.The tomatoes should be tender but still able to hold their form.
Do not cover the baking pan as you roast the tomatoes.
 Pull the tomatoes out of the oven and fold the chopped basil and oregano into the mix. Return to the oven for another 30 minutes.


If using dried herbs instead of fresh, use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) dried basil and 1/3 tsp (1.67 ml) dried oregano., After removing the tomatoes from the oven, puree the contents of the baking pan using a food mill. The food mill will break the tomatoes down into a sauce while also filtering out seeds and skins.


A food processor is the next best option if you do not have a food mill. If you do not have a food processor, use a blender or hand-held immersion blender, instead.
If all else fails, mash up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon until it looks like tomato puree.
, It doesn't matter if it is too hot, just leave it a little less on the stove.
 If the sauce is too thin, heat it in a small saucepan over medium heat until it reduces down.This could take 30 minutes or longer depending on how thin the sauce is.
Plum tomatoes tend to be sweet instead of bitter, but if the sauce is not sweet enough for your preference, sugar can be added at this stage. Stir the sugar into the sauce and heat for 5 minutes or more, until well incorporated.
Stir the sauce periodically with a wooden spoon to prevent it from burning on the stove.

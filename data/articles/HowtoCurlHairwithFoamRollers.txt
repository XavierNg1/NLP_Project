 Do this around bedtime so that there will be plenty of time overnight for the wrapped tresses to dry completely.






You know what works or your hair the best, so use whatever conditioner, oil, cream, and other products for your hair, as needed.;
, If necessary, use a detangling spray before combing or brushing out any tangles.






Comb your hair with a wide tooth comb only, so as not to break the hair or split the ends.
 You want it damp enough to style, yet not so wet that it canâ€™t dry out and hold its curls.
 Prep them with a quarter-size spritz of setting lotion or mousse. Place the product on your fingertips and run it through the length of the bangs. Position a roller under the bangs, about two inches from the tips. This should give you enough hair to wind around once and catch in the roller. Continue wrapping till it touches the scalp. Get as tight a wrap as possible to prevent hair from loosening while you sleep.
 Keep them separated with claw clips.
 Try to make even rows, using large foam rollers. Section the hair roughly the width of the roller; the amount depends on how many curls you want. Prep with more setting lotion or mousse, making sure you coat the entire length of hair for each roller.






For ringlets, position rollers vertically as you wind the hair inward. For fuller, softer curls, position the rollers horizontally.
 Switch to medium or small rollers as you get closer to your neck.
 These come from the impression in the hair left by the plastic clasp or closure on the foam roller. To keep this from happening, gently reposition the clasp from the top of the curl to the bottom after the roller has been fastened. Anchor the closure with either an aluminum duckbill clip or a bobby pin.
 For a carefree, tousled look, lightly run your fingers through your hair, just enough to loosen the curls. If you must use a hairbrush, just touch up the ends of each curl.

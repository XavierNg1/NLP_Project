 Don't assume that an expensive hotel won't be infested; bedbug infestations are found around the world in big cities and small towns.


Strip your bed down to the mattress and look for reddish bug droppings on the mattress as well as along the headboard and around baseboards.
Pack clothing in protective plastic bags and leave them there when in a hotel. Since bedbugs can infest closets and walls, you're better off not unpacking.
 Know which vaccinations are required or recommended for the countries you are visiting.


Call your local health department at least 2 months in advance of your journey to allow ample time for vaccination protocols.
 Avoid raw meats and fish in foreign countries with questionable sanitation practices.
 Copies will be helpful in case a natural disaster strikes your hotel or thieves steal your luggage.


Ask contacts in your home city to hold extra copies should you lose all of yours.
 Know what climatologists expect in your destination. If a damaging weather event is imminent, ask locals where to go for safety.

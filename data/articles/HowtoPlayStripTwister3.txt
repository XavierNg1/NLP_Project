 Naked Twister generally works best if you’re playing solely with a significant other. Instead of gradually taking off your clothing throughout the game, start naked and up the ante by distracting each other with physical affection.Try licking, nuzzling, kissing or tickling your opponent to get them to relinquish their spot on the board.Make the game more romantic by turning down the lights and adding some candles. Just make sure not to knock the candles over in the heat of the moment.
 In Drunk Twister, the game remains the same, but each player must take a shot each time they slip on the mat, but don’t fall. The game continues until everyone has fallen, or everyone has drunk so much that they can’t go on.Use small shot glasses for drinks, otherwise the game may take a dangerous turn.
You can choose to increase the number of shots a player has to take for each slip. For example, after the first slip, they might take one shot, after the second, two and so on.
 Take Naked Twister one step further by rubbing your opponent down with baby oil before beginning the game. Play Naked Twister as you normally would, but expect to spend most of the time slipping and sliding across the board.In keeping with the theme, the loser of Oily Twister must give the winner a full-body massage.

 If you feel you don't know where to begin revising, go through your previous work and text books about the subject. Skim through them and look for the areas in which you would feel least happy about popping up in your exam. Take a note of these because those are the ones you should revise for first!;
, Then you can download the syllabi from their websites to revise from.
 You will only end up going on Facebook or Youtube. If there are websites you want to revise from, print off the pages you need. Do not work in a busy environment, this will distract you and you won't concentrate on the page you are reading. Study groups are a dangerous area; only form one of these if you are sure you won't end up chatting about the weekend gossip, however they can be very helpful if you don't understand an answer to something. Ask a friend about something you don't understand, as they may be able to explain it to you in a way you do understand. Work in a clear space, believe it or not, this helps you relax. In a cluttered space with unnecessary items everywhere, it's easy to feel cramped and unable to work, so clean your area before you settle down to work.
 It is best to do this by e-mail. Organize a study group if you can handle it..or just ask one friend who is in the same boat as you, that's what friends are for.

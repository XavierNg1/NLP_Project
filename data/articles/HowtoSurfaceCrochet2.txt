 Use a slip knot to tie the yarn onto the crochet hook.
 Slide the hook into the first stitch you plan to work with for your design.


More specifically, insert the hook through the back horizontal bar of the stitch you're working over.
If you're familiar with standard single crochet, this back horizontal bar will be treated as the top portion of the stitch you'd usually work with.
 Yarn over the tip of the hook from back to front while the hook is still behind the overall piece. Pull the hook and this yarn-over back to the front of the piece, creating a loop in the process.


There should be two loops on your hook after this step.
 Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook again, working from back to front.
 Grab the previous yarn-over with the hooked tip and carefully pull it through both loops on the hook.


This completes one surface single crochet.
Note that there should be one loop left on your hook when you complete the stitch.
 Work as many single surface crochet stitches as needed to complete the desired surface pattern.


You will essentially be working a row of standard single crochet. Instead of inserting the hook through the next stitch in the row, though, you'll be inserting the hook through the next stitch of the piece you're decorating.
 When you reach the end of the pattern, cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Grab this tail with your crochet hook and pull it through the final loop on your hook.


This should get rid of the last loop on your hook and tie off your project.
Note that you should also weave in the loose tail end to hide it and help prevent the stitches from unraveling.

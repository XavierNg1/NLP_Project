 The name you choose should clearly identity the main topic of your group. For example, if you are starting a group for people who enjoy hiking in your area, give your group a name such as "Las Vegas Hiking Group."

, The description should accurately describe the types of topics, discussions, and events that can be found within the posts for this group. For example, if the group is for a local softball team, explain in the description that all discussions and events in the group will be related to sporting events and team practices.
 By default, Google Groups will assign a group email address based on your group description. Members who join the group will receive and reply to posts using this email address.


Modify the name of the group email address if you do not agree with the default email address provided.

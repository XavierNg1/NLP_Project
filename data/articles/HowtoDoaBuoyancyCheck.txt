,, Don't breathe out, don't kick fins, don't use arms.



If properly weighted you should end floating with water at eye level. When you breathe out you should then sink.
If you sink while still holding breath you are then over-weighted.
If end with water around chin, mouth or nose - you might be under-weighted.

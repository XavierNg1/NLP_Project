 Vigorous guitar playing may make you sweat, and occasionally, you may end up playing your guitar without washing your hands. Salt deteriorates metal strings and makes nylon strings dirty.To help your strings last longer, wipe them with a soft, lint-free cloth after each playing session to keep them clean.


You can buy a special flannel cloth at a music store that is specifically designed for cleaning instrument strings. To clean the strings, gently wrap one string at a time in your fingers through the cloth,and wipe down its length, rubbing as you go.
If you don’t have a string-cleaning cloth, a clean cotton T-shirt works just fine, too. Pick a portion of the shirt without any lint or screen-prints to wipe your strings down, so you don’t scratch your guitar., If your strings are very dirty or corroded, it can be helpful to deep clean them with a special, alcohol-based string-cleaning formula such as Big Bends or Ernie Ball. Many brands have products incorporated into disposable wipes and are specifically formulated not to damage the wood of your instrument.Clean your strings with the alcohol-based wipe much as you would with your soft cloth. Grip the string through the cloth between your fingers, and wipe down the length of each string one at a time, rubbing gently to remove dirt.
 Specially designed tools, such as The String Cleaner from ToneGear, can give your strings 360 degrees of cleaning. These tools sandwich all of your strings between two microfiber pads, which you sweep up and down the length of the strings.


Because it can be difficult to get large fingers under your strings, these tools can help clean the underside of your strings more thoroughly than using a cloth alone.

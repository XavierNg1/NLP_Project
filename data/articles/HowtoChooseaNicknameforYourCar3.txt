 Take all of the names that you're considering for your car and write them down on a piece of paper or type them into a word document. Narrow down the names that you don't like by crossing them out. Come back to the list at a later date and continue to narrow down the names until you only have a couple of options left. This should help you come up with the perfect name of your car., Once you've narrowed down your choices or chosen a name, run it by your close family and friends to see what their reaction is. Take their suggestions into consideration. If there is a name that is wildly popular among many of your friends and family, you can assume that the name is a good one., Don't feel rushed to name your car. Instead, take your time and think about the narrowed down choices that you wrote on your list. Once you decide on a name, stick with it. Constantly changing the name of your car will confuse people and defeats the purpose of naming your car in the first place.

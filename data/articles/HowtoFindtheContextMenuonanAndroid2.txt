 Open the App Drawer located at the bottom right of the main screen. Scroll through the app list and choose the app you wish to open. Tap to open.
 Since many people do not have phones with physical buttons on them, there are alternatives like the 3 dots icon. In the upper right, or sometimes left-hand side of an app, there will be 3 vertically rising dots, or sometimes vertically rising bars. Tap the icon to open the context menu.

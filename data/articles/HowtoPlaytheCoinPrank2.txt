 Use a penny or another coin that is higher in value like a quarter, dime, or half dollar. The larger the value of the coin, the more people will be inclined to pick it up. You’ll also need a long fishing wire. Fishing wire is good for this prank because it is difficult to see.


You can also use a fake coin, as long as it resembles a real coin.
You should use about three to five feet of fishing wire. The key is to find a close enough place to hide while performing the trick. You could also use a longer strand, but you shouldn't use more than ten feet of fishing wire.
 Use a dab of superglue to attach one end of the fishing wire to the coin. You could also tie the fishing wire onto the coin, but this might come loose easily. Test each method before taking it out into public.
 Go to a public setting like a park or somewhere you’ll be able to hide easily. Plant the coin in the middle of a walkway while nobody is around. Go hide somewhere unassuming, but in a place you can easily see the coin.


Make sure you have a grip of the fishing wire and its slack so you can easily pull the string to trick someone.
 Wait until a curious stranger comes to pick up your prepared coin. Once they bend over and start to reach for the coin, give the wire a tug. If they begin to chase after the coin, tug the coin again. Keep the prank going for as long as they fall for it.


You can reveal yourself if they haven’t discovered you yet.

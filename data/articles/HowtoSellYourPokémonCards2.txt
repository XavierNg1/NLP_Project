Sort your Pok√©mon out into piles of each type, eg.: Pikachu, Ratatta.
Sort Trainer out into each type, eg.: Switch, Potion.
Sort Energy out into piles of each eg.: Lightning, Grass.
 Write the number of cards on a Post-It, and stick one on each pile.
 To do so, search websites that have pricing guides for your cards. You can also search eBay for the current trading value of your cards.
 The columns should include: card name, quantity, individual value and total value (quantity multiplied times the individual value). You may want to do this in Excel or a similar spreadsheet program.
 Do this by getting a total at the bottom of your quantity and total cost columns.
 You can do this by packaging the whole set, selling individual cards, or putting them in packs of ten. Alternatively, you can sell them to people in your area. Check with your younger brother's/sister's friends because your "junk" can become their "special treasure."'

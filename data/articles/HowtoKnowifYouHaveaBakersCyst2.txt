 While early stage bakerâ€™s cysts might cause pain when you use your knee a lot or when you move in a certain way, as the cyst gets worse you will be able to feel the pain whenever you move, regardless of how small the movement its.The pain will become more intense and may take on a burning sensation right where the cyst is located.
 When too much pressure gets put on the cyst at the knee joint, the cyst can actually tear. The fluid from the cyst will drain into the surrounding area, and the cyst will actually split open so that you might be able to see liquid leaking down the back side of your knee.
 The longer you wait to take care of the cyst, the less you will be able to move your knee. This inability to move well is both because of the pain you will feel when you move, and the inflammation that will actually keep you from bending your knee. Signs that you should consider getting treatment for your cyst include:


Being unable to fully bend your knee.
Being unable to fully extend (or straighten) your knee.
Feeling pain while trying to bend and extend your knee.
 Sometimes a baker's cyst might become enlarged and actually spread down into your calf muscle. If this happens, your calf might develop a red, rash-like appearance. Your leg might also feel warm (which is known as erythema) and your lower leg could become swollen (which is called distal edema). The swelling is caused by the enlarged cyst pressing on the veins of your leg.


If you are aware of other medical conditions, this enlarged cyst is similar to the condition called deep vein thrombosis.
 On rare occasions, an enlarged cyst can break open, leaking fluid into your calf muscle. Signs that this has happened include severe pain, warmth, and tenderness in your calf. Your calf might also develop red or blueish spots where blood has leaked into the surrounding tissue. If you see any of these symptoms, go to a hospital immediately.

 Normally, brake fluid is brown. If the fluid looks dark or black, it may need to be replaced but further testing is needed.
 As brake fluid ages, its corrosion inhibitors break down. Test strips check the presence of copper in the brake fluid; the higher the level, the more worn out the inhibitors are. One such test strip is Phoenix Systems' "Brake Strip Brake Fluid Test Strip"








, Brake fluid is hygroscopic, which means that over time, it absorbs moisture from its surroundings. Moisture dilutes and weakens the effectiveness of brake fluid, which leads to braking systems components to corrode. In 18 months, brake fluid can have up to 3 percent water, which can lower its boiling point from 40 to 50 percent.
 New DOT 3 specification brake fluid is to have a dry boiling point of 401 degrees Fahrenheit (205 degrees Celsius) and a wet boiling point of 284 degrees (140 degrees Celsius), while DOT 4 fluid is to boil at 446 degrees (230 degrees Celsius) dry and 311 degrees (155 degrees Celsius) wet. The lower the point at which the brake fluid boils, the less effective it is.









Your mechanic should have both an optical refractometer and electronic brake fluid tester to perform these tests for you as part of an automotive checkup.

 This declaration can be about the work itself, or a conclusion you've come to about the theme or significance of the piece. A declaration has the benefit of sounding authoritative and should grab the reader's attention. Some examples of good declarative first sentences:


"There is such a thing as too much beauty in a film, as Terrance Malick's The Tree of Life illustrates."

, Your thesis will be an analysis and presentation of the artistic work you are reviewing. Broadly speaking, you can endorse or reject an artistic work, or choose to avoid giving a general verdict and instead focus on painting a picture. Because many film review readers, however, expect a verdict of the film you are reviewing, it's best to at least mention that in the introduction if you do plan on offering one.
 Many readers of serious artistic review expect critics to put the piece(s) of art being written into a literary or filmic context. What does this mean? This means talking about what other books or movies influenced it, whether it firmly owes to one artistic movement, or whether it has any political aspirations, for example. Many readers appreciate this fitting into a framework to at least begin to happen in the introduction.

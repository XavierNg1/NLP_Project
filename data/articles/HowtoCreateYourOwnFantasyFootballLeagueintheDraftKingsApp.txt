 This home screen is the first screen you see when you first open the DraftKings app. Once you create a contest, select which football league you want your fantasy league to draw its players from – either the NFL or the CFB. Once you do this, pick the date and the start time of the specific games you want.
 Public leagues are open to anyone who wants to join the football contests you’ll create. Private leagues, on the other hand, are invitation-only contests. DraftKings lets you invite other players to private contests through email, the DraftKings friends list, or through other leagues.

All entry fees will be refunded if the league’s slots are not filled up. If you create a 50-man league, those 50 spots have to be filled up. Otherwise the league will not run and all entry fees will be returned to those who joined., Leagues can vary in size anywhere between three and a hundred people at a time. You can increase the size of the league in increments of one up to 20 (e.g. 3, 4, 5, 6… 18, 19 and then 20). After 20, the league sizes will increase in increments of five up to 40 (e.g. 20, 25, 30, 35 and then 40). You will then have the option to increase the size to 50, 75 and finally 100., You can create a free league that costs no money to join. You can also pick one of the following entry fees: $1.00, $2.00, $5.00. $10.00, $20.00, $50.00, $109.00, $215.00, $530.00, $1060.00, $5300.00 and finally $10600.00., You can select between Winner Takes All, 50/50, and Top 2, 3 and 5 Players.

Winner Take All is where the highest-scoring player takes the entire prize pool.
50/50 will divide the league into two by score – the top half and the bottom half. The top half will receive double the entry fees they paid as a reward (i.e. a winning player will receive $40 if he paid a $20 entry fee and was able to score well enough to place on the upper half of the league).
The Top 2, 3 and 5 Player prize structures will award the prize pool to the top 2, 3 and 5 highest-scoring players. For example, setting a Top 5 prize for a 100-man league with a $1,000 prize pool means that the five highest-scoring players will each receive $200, which is the $1,000 prize pool divided by five.
 This is pretty straightforward. Just give your fantasy league a name of your choosing, and tap in a message. The message is optional though, and you can skip it if you want to., Once you create a league, you will be reserved a spot in the league you just created. You will then be directed to a screen where you can create a lineup from scratch or import one if you’ve already created a lineup in advance.

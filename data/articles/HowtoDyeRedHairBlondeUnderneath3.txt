 Once you have finished rinsing, use a purple shampoo. Only use the purple shampoo on the bottom portion of your hair. This shampoo will remove any red or yellow from your hair. Leave it on for about five minutes and then rise it out until the water runs clear.Use the purple shampoo once a week to keep yellow tones out of your hair. Leave it on between two and five minutes.
 Put conditioner on your hair again when you have rinsed the purple shampoo out of it. Leave the deep conditioner on for at least five minutes. Deep condition your hair at least once a week to keep it soft.You can also choose to use a leave-in conditioner.
 Your roots will begin to grow out after a few weeks. If you donâ€™t want to keep the blonde underneath, you can dye all of your hair. If you do, you will need to dye your roots. Go through the same process to dye your hair (using the developer and dye), but only apply the color to your roots.

 To make these delicious coconut candy squares, you will need:


1 1/2 cups of shredded coconut
2 cups of white sugar
1/2 cup of light corn syrup
1/2 cup of water
2 tablespoons of butter
1/4 teaspoon of salt
1/8 teaspoon of baking soda;
, Before you begin, line a 9x13" cake tray with aluminum foil and spray the foil with a non-stick cooking spray. Set it aside while you prepare the candy mixture., Place the saucepan over a medium heat and stir continuously until the sugar dissolves.
 Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature of the mixture -- you want it to reach 240 °F (116 °C)., Once the mixture reaches 240 °F (116 °C), add the butter and stir until it's melted and combined. Allow the mixture to continue boiling (without stirring) until it reaches 260 °F (127 °C)., Once the mixture reaches 260 °F (127 °C), remove the saucepan from the heat and add in the shredded coconut, baking soda and salt, stirring well to combine. The mixture may foam a little at this point.
 Use a spatula to smooth the mixture into an even layer, then leave to set for several hours at room temperature. Once set, cut into small squares and enjoy!

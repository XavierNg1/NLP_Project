 The bucket may be placed anywhere, so long as the top of the bucket is below the bottom of the tank. If the tank is very large, additional tubing and coupling(s) may be required. Cut off any excess tubing, if desired., Begin by placing the vacuum end (the larger opening) of your tube inside your aquarium. You will want to keep the end of the siphon tube several inches above the gravel. Take the opposite end of your siphon tube, and point it toward your bucket.If the siphon you are starting has a “gravel vacuum” attached to it, you can rest the open end on top of the aquarium gravel.
 Place the vacuum opening (the larger tube opening) into the fish tank, so that water displaces the air in the tube. Then, slowly lower the remaining length of tubing into the tank. (Water should continue to displace the air from the entire length of the tubing.) If done correctly, there will be very little air left in the tubing.
 Grab the discharge opening (the other, more narrow end of the flexible tube). With the vacuum opening still submerged, seal the discharge opening by pressing a finger over it. Do not break the seal., Lift the end of the tube with the discharge opening up and out of the tank. Lower it down into your bucket, maintaining the seal. Make sure the vacuum end is still against the tank bottom, and remove your finger from the discharge end of the tube. Water will begin to flow from the tank into the bucket.
 Keep the discharge end directed into the bucket, while you gently move the vacuum end around the tank bottom. It may be useful to have a second person on hand to help you.
 When you have removed enough water, you can stop the water flow by raising the discharge end to a point slightly higher than the aquarium.









You will need to flood the vacuum and tube again if additional siphoning needs to be performed.

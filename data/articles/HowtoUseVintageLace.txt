 Although your great-grandmother might have though that lace, lace doilies and lace-edged handkerchiefs, cloths etc. were too good to use in her day, she has left you with an amazing legacy of well-preserved reminders of the past. Consider the ways in which you can incorporate the lace pieces into your craft projects. For example:


Sew as feature pieces on quilts and hangings
Make a larger tablecloth from many smaller doilies and lace pieces
Embellish your clothing with old lace for a special look
Use in scrapping projects - add to cards or scrapbooks; it can also look fabulous as part of the cover of a scrapbook wedding album.;
, You might be able to insert it into the dress, or make accessories using it.
 After knitting a great tea cosy, dress it up with a flourish of old lace.
 Doilies, lace pieces and handkerchiefs edged with lace can make wonderful clothing items. Just add imagination and turn your doll or teddy into an heirloom.
 If it is really beautiful, turn it into a conversation piece and have it framed. If you know its origin and date, have a small plaque added to the frame as a family heirloom reminder.
 If you have a very romantic bedroom, this can be a very elegant use for vintage lace.

 System Preferences is the icon that appears as a white lightswitch with an apple on it in OS X 10.3 and earlier, and as a silver gear icon in OS X 10.4 and later.
 If you haven't installed any third-party panes, this button is the last icon, located at the lower right portion of System Preferences.
 Finished!

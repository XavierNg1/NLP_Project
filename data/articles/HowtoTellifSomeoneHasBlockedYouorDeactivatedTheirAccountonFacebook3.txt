 This method uses the ability to report spam or abuse on Facebook's messaging service to determine whether or not you've been blocked in a roundabout way. To begin, access your inbox and find an old conversation you've had with your friend. If you don't have any conversations with this friend, you won't be able to report your conversation, so you're better off with another method.


Though you're unlikely to create any serious repercussions for your friend by reporting him or her for spam (especially if s/he has done nothing wrong), doing so is rather disingenuous and could create further tensions with a person who's deliberately blocked you, so use this method with caution.
You'll want to use one-on-one conversations with the friend you suspect of blocking you, rather than group conversations that the user was a part of, for this method.
 When you're viewing your old conversation, click the "Actions" tab at the top of the window. Select "Report Spam or Abuse". Select the third option in the pop-up window, "Report conversation participant(s) for harassing..." and click the Okay button.


Again, it bears mentioning that reporting someone can easily be perceived as aggressive or petty, so avoid using this method for people with who you have a valued relationship.
 After you report this person, a confirmation window will pop up displaying his or her name, picture, and the words "Blocked" or "Report".


If you see "Blocked" next to your friend's name, you've been blocked.
If you see "Report" next to your friend's name, your friend has probably deleted his or her profile.
Again, note that with this method, you run the risk, however small, of opening your friend's account up to disciplinary action from Facebook, so use it only as a last resort.

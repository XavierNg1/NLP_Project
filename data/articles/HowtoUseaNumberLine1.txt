 This will be the base of your number line.


You can draw this in pen or marker, if you want to use your number line over and over again.;
, This will make it look like a train track.


You can also make these in pen so you can use the number line for more than one problem.
 Start with zero above the first hashmark on the left.


At each hashmark, write the next number up. For example, above the hash mark next to zero, write 1.
You can write these in pen as well, so you can re-use the number line over and over again.
 Remember, doing math problems with numbers over 20 will make this method too hard.


Now your number line should read from 0 to 20, going from left to right.

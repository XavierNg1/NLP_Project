 Stir it into the mixture so that it gets coated in oil and bits of squid. Use a wooden spoon to incorporate the rice into the onions, peppers and squid. Cook until the rice begins to smell toasty and fragrant.
 Add three cups of the stock, the red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to loosen the frying onions and peppers and stir the mixture together. Turn up the heat to bring it to a boil, then reduce it to a simmer and let the paella cook.


Do not stir the rice and other ingredients after you pour in the broth.






As the rice cooks and absorbs the broth, slowly add more broth 1/2 cup at a time. Continue adding broth until the rice is completely cooked.

 Your Furby may think this is funny at first and giggle or laugh. Don't worry, it will eventually turn evil.
 Again, your Furby may think that this is funny. It will soon change its mind, however.
 It will have evil, slanted eyes with girly lashes.


Your Furby may cry and act sick while you are flipping it. Don't take pity on it. Keep flipping it.
The app version will have a nunchucks, and the words: BAM! Pow!, If you'd like to turn your Furby nice again, try give it lots of hugs. You can also try petting it a lot. Some people find that pulling its tail often also changes its personality.

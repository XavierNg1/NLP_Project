 Slugs feed off of plants. You can give them leftover fruits and vegetables from your kitchen. You can also give them fresh fruits and vegetables, as long as you rinse them in distilled water first. It's important to remove pesticides before feeding plants to your slugs.If possible, opt for organic fruits that do not make use of pesticides.
In general, feed your slugs more vegetables than fruits. Slugs can die from consuming too much sugar, even natural sugar from fruits.
 Slugs also feed off of plants they find outside. Add things like old leaves, grass, and other plants you find outside. Slugs feed on decaying plant matter, so if you have a plant that's dying you can feed it to your slug., Slugs may not eat everything you leave for them. Uneaten food, especially fruit, can attract fruit flies. Fruit flies can threaten a slug's heath, so remove uneaten food at the end of each day. This will minimize exposure to bugs and keep your slugs safe., Slugs do not need a separate water dish, just a moist environment. You should therefore spray the enclosure with a water bottle each day. You should use filtered water, as tap water can be harmful for slugs. It's important to keep a slug's environment moist so they can absorb the water they need.

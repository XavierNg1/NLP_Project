 Ratios are sometimes expressed using a colon (1:2{\displaystyle 1:2}) or the word “to” (1 to 2{\displaystyle {\text{1 to 2}}}). If your ratios are set up this way, turn them into fractions. Use a variable, such as x{\displaystyle x}, to stand for the missing number

For example, if you are baking cookies, and you need 6 cups of flour for every 4 batches of cookies, how many cups of flour do you need to make 20 batches of cookies? The first ratio is 64{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{4}}}. The second ratio is x20{\displaystyle {\frac {x}{20}}}, since you are trying to find out how many cups of flour you need to make 20 batches of cookies. So your proportion will be set up like this: 64=x20{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{4}}={\frac {x}{20}}}.
 Place this product to the right of the equation.

For example, 6×20=120{\displaystyle 6\times 20=120}:64=x20120{\displaystyle {\frac {\cancel {6}}{4}}={\frac {x}{\cancel {20}}}120}


, Place this product to the left of the equation.

For example, 4×x=4x{\displaystyle 4\times x=4x}:4x64=x20120{\displaystyle 4x{\frac {\cancel {6}}{\cancel {4}}}={\frac {\cancel {x}}{\cancel {20}}}120}


, This will give you the missing number in your second ratio. The two ratios are now in proportion.For example:4x=120{\displaystyle 4x=120}4x4=1204{\displaystyle {\frac {4x}{4}}={\frac {120}{4}}}x=30{\displaystyle x=30}.So, if you need 6 cups of flour for 4 batches of cookies, you will need 30 cups of flour for 20 batches of cookies. Thus, 64{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{4}}} and 3020{\displaystyle {\frac {30}{20}}} are ratios in proportion.

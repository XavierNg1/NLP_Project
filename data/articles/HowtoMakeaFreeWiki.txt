 The best way to find a free wiki that meets your needs is to go to Wiki Matrix.;
, Come up with a name and topic and get your website going. Remember, if you are using a wiki farm your wiki won't come with a domain name.
 You can do this by visiting Wiki Index or searching for the wiki in Google.
 After you create a account it will say create wiki, click that and it will let you pick a format and the title of your wiki.
, Make sure it doesn't look like other wikis out there.


Choose a color scheme. Sites like Wikia allow you to customize the color for most parts of your wiki.
Come up with a logo.
 Make sure it at least has information about the topic and purpose of your wiki as well as some photos and links to a few articles. In addition, you should list ways in which people can contribute to the wiki such as writing articles, copyediting, categorizing, adding photos etc.
 It's no fun editing a wiki by yourself. Tell people in your social networks -- both online and offline. You can also contact bloggers who write content about your topic to see if they'd be interested in contributing.
 The best thing to do is find freely licensed photos and articles to seed the wiki so that people have something to edit once they get there. Wikimedia Commons, Flickr and Morgue File are good sources for freely licensed photos.

 After washing your hair, lean forward and flip all your hair over your head. Now your hair will dry away from your neck, instead of hanging flat against your skin.
 Still leaning forward, blow dry from above, pointing at at the underside of your hair. At the same time, brush from the other side using a round brush. Brush from the roots to the tip, gently pulling your hair in a curve as you move the brush opposite the blow dryer.


You can brush dry hair the same way, without the blow dryer.
 Instead of blow drying, towel-dry or air-dry until your hair is slightly damp. Then "scrunch" your hair by cupping a small amount of volumizing mousse onto a section of your hair ends. Lift this section up to your scalp, gently squeezing and "crumpling." Repeat with each section of hair and let air dry into a wavy texture.
 Teasing or playing with the hair at the nape of your neck can encourage it to dry in a stiffer volume. For a more pronounced effect (although one that can damage brittle hair), back comb by brushing the "wrong way," from the tips to the roots. Do this with small sections of hair at a time, especially the top layers of hair at the top and sides of your head, so it stands up with a much larger profile.
 Spray your scalp and roots with hairspray to retain the volume longer. If your hair is short, volumizing gel or mousse will work instead.

 Whether you live in an apartment building or you live in a house, the chances are that one of your neighbors is already paying for Internet services. Since tapping into your neighbor's WiFi without their consent is illegal, you should ask them if you can use it.Some neighbors will let you use their Internet service for free; otherwise, a common arrangement is that you two split the bill -- which isn't exactly free, but it is cheaper than paying alone!
You can also barter with your neighbors for access to their Internet: for instance, you cut their grass, clean their car, etc.;
, Oftentimes, if you live in an apartment building, the building will offer free wireless Internet access for its residents in select areas. This, of course, is only helpful if you live in an apartment building.
 If you live in the city, chances are a building in your proximity offers free wireless Internet access for its residents or guests, and sometimes this network will require no username or password to access.


As you may not be the intended user for a neighboring building's wireless Internet, if you are caught there may be legal ramifications., Most locations nationwide are eligible to receive "free" dial-up Internet service through providers like NetZero and Juno. You can find out if you're in such a location by searching All-Free-ISP.com. The only catch is that these services put ads on your browser while you access the Internet., If you are already paying for Internet on your phone and are looking to access it through your computer, many services offer a tethering feature for free, which would allow you to use your phone's Internet service on your computer by connecting them through Bluetooth or WiFi. Call your service provider and ask if this is the case.


If you're already paying for it, then it isn't free -- but it is an economical use of your money!

 This basic sauce is the trick to adding flour to a stew to thicken it without creating lumps. Mix equal amounts of butter and flour together in a separate pan. Heat the roux to thicken into a smooth paste-like sauce.









Add the roux bit by bit to the stew, stirring constantly. Doing this gradually is as important as making the roux with care, to avoid creating lumps. The stew will soon thicken and the flavor will be enhanced rather than changed.

Vegetable oil can be substituted for the butter if preferred.
 Mix a tablespoon of cornflour or cornstarch per cup of stew liquid with enough water to make a paste. Stir thoroughly until a smooth paste forms. Add gradually, stirring constantly, until the stew thickens up enough. Make sure that each addition is fully integrated, if you add too much the sauce will turn into a paste.









Arrowroot can be substituted for cornflour or cornstarch. It has a more neutral flavor than cornstarch and can be used at varying temperatures without losing its ability to thicken foods. It tolerates acidic ingredients better than cornstarch and it can be cooked for a longer length of time.

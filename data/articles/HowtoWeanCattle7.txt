 Weaning an orphan calf that you have raised and nurtured for the past few months can be and emotional strain on both you and the calf. The calf will complain a fair bit during the weaning process but you must be diligent and stubborn.


Bottle calves should be weaned by the time they are around 3 to 4 months of age.
 These two methods include reducing the quantity of milk the calf gets per day, or diluting the milk solution gradually to the point where he's drinking only water.


Reducing the quantity of milk can be a bit more stressful on the calf because he'd not getting the same amount of milk that he had before the weaning process started. Cutting back a few pounds per day is a good way to start.
Diluting the milk is more towards the natural way a cow would wean her calf. This is because by the time the calf has reached a certain age (i.e., 3 months), the milk quality that the cow produces decreases over time. Diluting the milk formula an eighth (1/8) at a time until the "milk" is 100% water is a good way to go.
 The calf should already be eating hay and/or grain and/or grass by the time the weaning process has started.


Also ensure that the hand-reared calf is on good pasture that is clean and leafy, if there is pasture available.

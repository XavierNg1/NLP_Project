 Set up a safe space behind a safety gate, under a table, or in a bedroom. Or leave your dog’s crate open so it can use the crate as a safe space. Make sure your dog can get to the space easily and quickly by removing any furniture or other barriers to its movement.Consider putting your dog in the space before children visit your home.
 Stand near your dog’s safe space and give it a verbal cue to move into the space, like “go to your spot.” Next, show your dog a treat and throw it into the space. Praise your dog when it moves into the space to eat the treat. Practice this sequence again a few times. Gradually train your dog to move into the space without the treat. Reward your dog with praise and occasionally give it treats to reinforce this behavior., Tell children who visit your home to ignore your dog. Your dog will feel more secure without any pressure to interact or react to children. Don’t allow children near this safe space. Be sure to supervise children in your home and keep them away from your dog’s safe zone.Don’t let children crowd your dog anywhere in your home.

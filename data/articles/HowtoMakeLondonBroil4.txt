 Your grill should be hot before you place any meat on it. Using a nonstick spray will make it easier when you have to flip your London Broil.
 Set your grill to medium heat. You should cook your London Broil 4 inches above your coals. You know when one side of your meat is ready because of the dark caramelization that should form on each side.


Don't move or flip your London Broil more than once, or it could cook unevenly and become tough.
 Move the London Broil to a separate plate and allow it to rest so it retains its juices and finishes cooking. Do not put your London Broil on the same plate that you used to hold the raw meat or you may get sick from cross contamination.

 Do not attempt to rock out while zooming down the Autobahn at top speeds. Intense jamming can be very distracting and endanger the lives of others if done incorrectly.


Remove all uncovered liquids from the rocking out area. Hot coffee on your lap is not a good look on anyone.
Only rock out when stuck in a traffic jam, on the open road, or at a stop light. Driving should be your first priority, rocking out your second. True, this makes for less than ideal rocking out conditions, but sometimes it just has to do.
 If a song comes on the radio and you find yourself squealing, let your inner rocker come alive.


If you're in a residential area, roll up your windows. Babies are trying to sleep! If you run into the cops, you could be charged with disturbing the peace.

If you're on the open road, roll 'em down and feel that breeze in your hair. Feel it? That's the freedom to rock out. Be grateful. Not everybody lives a life of such rocking privilege.
 Just because you're in a car does not mean your skills should be compromised.


Your steering wheel is your drum and your seatbelt is your guitar strap. The road is your home. Go ahead! Punch, headbang, shimmy, and grit your teeth.

Do these things with your eyes open. At all times. Keep your eyes on the road. Rocking out in a car requires the art of multitasking. Always put safe driving first.

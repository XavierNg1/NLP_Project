, Unlike Gimp, Paint.net is a small file and does not need too much waiting time just to download it. Search "Paint.net" in any search engine and download it from there. NOTE: the recent version may not work with older versions of Windows, so here's another link for earlier versions ,, Skip 1 or 2 frames before you're about to shoot. In Vista, click the "Tools" toolbar and 'Take picture from preview' to take a snapshot of that scene. Now having that picture, click the "Split" button, then move one frame forward, then click the "Split" button again. Now delete that frame in between the both.
 There are many out there, both available for free and to buy. Before you download a muzzle flash effect, make sure it has to be a still frame of it. Here's a link to download 4 effects from a YouTube video that a person put up.
 Open up your picture in Paint.NET. Drag your scene in it, then your muzzle flash effect. When prompted, click 'Add into layers'. Using the 'Move selected pixels' tool, drag and resize the muzzle flash into a suitable size and shape. It doesn't matter if it cuts out the border, leaving it as it is in your liking should do. Once you're happy with your picture, save it as a .jpg file.
 Now change the timing of the picture to 0.03 s then view the video from the start.
 In that link I gave you, it has 4 sounds added for a specific weapon. Simply drag this into the 'Audio' bar where the shooting is in 'Timeline' view for older versions of Windows Movie Maker. In Windows 7 WMM, just drag it into the scene where the shooting happens. If you want more sounds, visit the link here , Make sure everything is in the right order in the exact time. If you're happy with the video, save it and publish it.

 Compressed air (usually used to dust computer parts) is particularly effective for clearing dust off of curved surfaces and recesses. The high pressure blasts off dust relatively easily and the long nozzle allows you to reach around a plant’s curves and nooks.


You may want to take the plant outside before dusting it this way, or the dust might linger in the air.;
, If you don’t have access to a can of compressed air, a blow dryer can serve the same purpose. It might not be as effective, but it can still take care of most of the dust. Make sure to use a low or cool setting, as too much heat could damage the plant., After clearing the bulk of the dust, inspect the plant for any remaining dust and wipe it away. Pay close attention to the stems and places where the leaves tend to bunch up.

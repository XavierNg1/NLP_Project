 The quickest way to thaw crab legs is to place them under cold, running water for several minutes.


The recommended thawing method takes much longer. Place the crab legs in the refrigerator and let them defrost from a frozen state for 8 hours or overnight.
While the microwave can be used to cook the crab legs, it is not recommended for the purpose of thawing the seafood.



If you cannot arrange all the crab legs in a single, you may want to cook them in separate batches. You could arrange them in multiple even layers, but if you do this, you will need to toss them with a fork once or twice in the middle of the cooking cycle to ensure even cooking.
A glass casserole dish with a lid is a standard choice, but any microwave-safe container will suffice.
 Fill the container with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of warm to hot water for every 8 oz (225 g) of crab legs.


For this recipe, which uses 3 lbs (1350 g) of crab legs, you will need to add 6 Tbsp (180 ml) of water.
It is better to use warm to hot water instead of cool water.
 Cook the crab legs for 3 to 4 minutes per 8 oz (225 g) of crab legs.


For 3 lbs (1350 g) of crab legs, microwave on 100 percent power for 18 to 24 minutes.
You may need to stir or shift around the crab legs in the middle of the cooking process to promote even cooking.
 Enjoy the heated crab legs immediately, serving them with melted butter or lemon wedges, if desired.

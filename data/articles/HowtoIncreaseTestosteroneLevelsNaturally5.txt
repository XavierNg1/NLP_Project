Smaller testes (hypogonadism)
Decreased sperm counts
A decrease in muscle mass leading to decreased strength and endurance
Changes in blood lipids such as cholesterol levels
Osteopenia (softening of the bones) and osteoporosis (decreased bone density)
Hot flashes
Swollen or tender breasts (gynecomastia)

, In addition to physical effects, men may also notice mood changes associated with low testosterone. These can include:


Decreased sex drive (libido)
Fatigue
Mood changes, including depression, irritability, and anxiety
Problems with memory, concentration, or a sudden lack of self-confidence

Your doctor will diagnose the condition if your combination of symptoms and lab results indicate low testosterone levels.

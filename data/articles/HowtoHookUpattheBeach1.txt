 Preferably, go in a group unless you are already going out.;
, Make it interesting and keep it flowing. The more you talk, the better you get to know each other, and the closer you get to hooking up.
 After you've gotten to know him quite well, lead him quietly away from the group. After all, it's better make out in peace.
 When you are separated from the rest of the group, talk more about more personal issues. Find out if he's seeing anyone or if he's interested.
 If you get positive feedback, move in for the kiss. Don't make it too obvious, just a bit but make it count. If he kisses you back, then you are good!

 A pantry or cupboard works best. Look for a relatively cool location and avoid notably warm spots. Even though the packaging should prevent the food from spoiling, prolonged heat still has the potential to spur bacteria growth.;
, Place the jars with the earliest expiration dates toward the front of your stockpile every time you restock. Doing so may help you to remember to use food before it expires.
 Tightly close the lid and use the food within 2 or 3 days.
 If you fed your baby directly from the jar, throw it away. Bacteria from your baby's saliva will transfer into the food and grow as it sits, making it unsafe for consumption later.
 Bacteria grow rapidly at room temperature, especially in liquid and pureed foods.

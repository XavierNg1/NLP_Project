 Between Makapuu Ave. and 18th Ave, there's a road on the crater side that goes up. Look for the Diamond Head sign. If you're taking the bus from Waikiki, take routes 1, 3, 22 (does not run on Tuesdays), and 23. There is a bus stop right in front of the entrance, so inform the bus driver that you're going to Diamond Head & be on alert when you go up the hill.;
, Pedestrians can walk on the dirt/rock path (on the side of oncoming traffic) instead of the actual road. Be sure to stop at the first scenic point before heading into the tunnel. This point views the Kahala district.
 There is a limited space for pedestrians. Always drive slow and have vehicle headlights on.
 The entrance fees are $1 per pedestrian, $5 each car, $10 for commercial cars/vans, $20 for mini-buses, and $40 for buses. If available, you can also grab a trail map, along with a ticket stub for your fee.
 Not only that a person can learn about the trail, but also discover Diamond Head's history and its usage in World War I. There are water fountains and a restroom facility nearby.
 It starts off as a paved cement path, leads to dirt, and then rocks. Beginning at the first height increment, metal guard rails are placed for safety. Before you get to the top, there are two other scenic areas to view from. Numerous benches are placed along the trail and there are other places to step aside for people to take a breath.
 The first flight of stairs are located outside the 2nd scenic point, ascending about 74 steps. The second flight is between that & the 3rd scenic point. This is a 99 step staircase. The third flight of stairs is a metal spiral one, located after the dark tunnel, about 30 steps.
 Be sure to watch your step and duck your head as you are heading towards the summit opening.
 Even if you don't have a companion, look around and ask someone to take a picture of you. Take a lot of pictures from all directions, as it is an amazing experience.

 Before even considering the more dangerous option of playing games at your desk, you must teach your mind and your body to quickly switch between computer windows, specifically from games to email, or do anything else that looks like work. Only once you are confident in your ability to switch tabs at a moment's notice can you move on to the next step.
 This can be a very hard decision, but is very important in the following steps. If you can't decide on one specific game, perhaps try to settle on a category of game that you wish to play, such as flash games.
 If you want to try flash games, make sure you have the correct version of Flash installed on your computer. You can even download a free trial of some games like Roller Coaster Tycoon with ease.
 Once you start playing the game you have chosen, you will likely lose your sense of the people around you and who may be watching over your shoulder. It is important that you keep a watchful eye behind you every once in a while to avoid any potential repercussions from your superiors.
 You have prepared yourself for what's ahead of you. It was the risky choice, but you have now pulled through. Good luck!

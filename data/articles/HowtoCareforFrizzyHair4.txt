 Coconut oil is a great oil for moisturizing hair and taming frizz. Purchase a jar of coconut oil from your local grocery store. This can be found in the cooking oil aisle. Before sleeping, apply a liberal amount of coconut oil to your hair, making sure that it is completely coated. Go to sleep and wash off the next morning. This will give the oil plenty of time to absorb into the cuticle, effectively taming flyaways and adding shine and gloss to your hair., Whenever you use styling cream, add a quarter-sized amount of leave-in conditioner to it. Massage the mixture into your damp hair with your fingers. You can either let your hair air-dry or style it as you normally would. Leave-in conditioners can be purchased at grocery stores or beauty supply stores, such as Sephora or Ulta., Sometimes too many products can leave hair feeling crunchy or stiff. When you have finished styling your hair, add a touch of vitamin E oil, which can be purchased at your local drugstore or beauty supply store, to your ends or wherever your hair feels stiff. Try CococareÂ® 100% Vitamin E Oil or OGX Healing + Vitamin E Penetrating Oil.

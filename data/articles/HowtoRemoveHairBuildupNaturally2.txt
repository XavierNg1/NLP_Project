 In this recipe, you will be using a baking soda rinse to remove build-up from your hair. Here is what you will need:2 tablespoons of baking soda
3 cups (675 milliliters) water
A bottle or pitcher to hold the rinse

, Pour the water into a large bottle or pitcher. Add the baking soda and stir with a spoon until the baking soda is completely dissolved.
 Soak your hair with water and gently massage your favorite shampoo into it. Rinse the shampoo out. This is to get rid of the initial layer of dirt and oil.
 Tilt your head back, close your eyes, and pour the baking soda solution over your hair. Make sure that it goes from your hairline, down your hair, and towards the ends.
 This is to get rid of any residue from the baking soda.
 While it helps to remove build-up, baking soda can also be a little drying when it comes to hair. You can prevent your hair from becoming too dry by washing your hair again with some water and your favorite conditioner. Be sure to rinse your hair wellâ€”unless you are using a leave-in conditioner.

 This is just a sketch for the shape of the cactus, so no need to elaborate beyond what's shown (just make sure it's large enough to add plenty of details to later).
 This will be the pot in which the cactus sits. It should be rounder than the cactus itself, like a horizontal crescent moon., Make a thin line around the edge of the pot to show where the rim is, and where the inside begins. Also try to make the bottom appear flatter, so the fact that the bowl is standing (not rolling) doesn't defy logic., Sketch lines curving to the right, following the shape of the cactus. Add a burst of flowers to the top of the cactus.

There should be a dozen or so flowers total, but you only really have to draw the three or four in the front; it's all about perspective, so put most of your concentration towards the petals protruding from the middle.
 Try to make a modular line--passing from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa. This will make your drawing look better and more professional., Look at the illustration for reference, but feel free to use whatever colors you'd like for your finished product.

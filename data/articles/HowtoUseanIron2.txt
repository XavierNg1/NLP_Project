 Turn the heat dial to the setting that is most appropriate for your fabric. Once you've selected a heat level, the metal will begin to grow warm. Let the iron become hot. You shouldn't need to wait more than a matter of seconds.The heat levels are often listed in relation to a certain type of fabric. For instance, cotton responds well to high heat and steam, but some synthetic fabrics might melt or fuse if they're exposed to such temperatures.Do not use an inappropriate setting!
Start with a low heat and work up. If you are ironing more than one item, start with the one that uses the lowest setting on the iron. This way, you won't need to let the iron cool down before you continue., Run the hot flat side of the iron firmly and slowly across the fabric. Smooth out the wrinkles. For the best results, work with the natural folds and creases of the garment.








Iron each individual part of the garment separately. For instance, if you're ironing a dress shirt, smooth out the collar, then the cuffs, then the sleeves, then the shoulders, then the placket â€“ and, finally, the main body of the shirt.Do not let the iron rest directly on the garment, lest the fabric overheats. If you are careless with the iron, you might start a fire!

, Now, flip the piece of clothing over and iron the other side. Make sure not to flatten any wrinkles or creases into the new side.
 If you bunch up the garment or leave it laying out, then there's a good chance that it will dry with wrinkles. Hang the fabric on a clothes hanger and let it air-dry.

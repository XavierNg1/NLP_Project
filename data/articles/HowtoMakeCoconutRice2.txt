 Place 2 cups of Thai jasmine-scented white rice in the cooker.
 Add 2 cups of water, 1 cup of coconut milk, and 1 tbsp. of dry shredded coconut to the rice. Stir the ingredients together with a plastic spoon until they're thoroughly combined to distribute the coconut flavor and to keep the rice from sticking.
, This depends on how long it takes for the ingredients in your cooker to finish steaming.
 Once it's done, fluffing the rice with the cooker spoon a bit will make it more soft and tasty., Enjoy this rice on its own or with chicken, veggies, or beef. You can also try it with shrimp, scallops, or other delicious seafood.

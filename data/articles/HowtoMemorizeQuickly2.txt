 There are 10 countries that could be organized according to some scheme or another.
 Chunking works well when you're memorizing things that are composed of smaller things in a sensible order. Our example could subdivide by continent; the elements of the periodic table could be broken down by type; or if you have to memorize the components of an engine, you could divide it up into sub-assemblies (intake, engine, exhaust, electrical).

If you've ever memorized a phone number, you might have noticed the way we write them - they're set up to be chunk-memorized. For instance, the White House phone number, (202) 456-1111 is easier to remember as three numbers - 202, 456 and 1111 - than it is to remember as a single complex number, 2,024,561,111.
Chunking isn't a great strategy for big, complex things and concepts that don't break down into parts easily. For example, it's not easy to figure out what "memorizable" chunks would be for memorizing the concept of civil rights, the definition of nationhood or a list of similar phone numbers.
 Since you'll have to create smaller pieces from big ones, this strategy works best with items that you can actually break down according to some sensible scheme.
 For our UN Security Council example, you might try reciting one of the continents and their countries from the list above:

, Mastering each individual portion or chunk is just the beginning - to fully memorize something using this method, you'll need to get the entire list down. Try scrolling down so the previous list is covered. How much of this list can you remember?

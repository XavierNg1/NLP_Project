 OneDrive is the cloud service of Microsoft, which you can access on your mobile device or on the PC. Each OneDrive user has 15GB free of cloud storage, so if you want to use OneDrive to store your files, you will need a Microsoft account first.


Open a new web browser tab or window and type “onedrive.live.com” on the address bar. Hit Enter and you will be taken to the OneDrive website.
 Click “Sign up” at the top right of the page, and on the pop-up that appears, select “Create a Microsoft account.” You will be redirected to the Create an Account page of Microsoft.
 The first two lines of the sign-up form will ask for your first and last name, and then for a username. Enter them there. If you have a Gmail or Yahoo account, you can use that as a username for the Microsoft sign-in.
 Make sure your Microsoft account password is at least 8 characters long and contains at least two of the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Reenter the password for confirmation when you’re done.
 The fields for these three pieces of information are drop-down options. Just click the down arrow to the right of the text boxes and select the country, date, and gender.
 Select your country code from the drop-down option below Gender and enter your phone number in the box below that. You will receive a text verification code or an audio call to verify that you’re a real person and not a bot.


Check out the characters you see in the box below the phone number. This is a Captcha. Enter it in the “Enter the characters you see” field. This is also to ensure that you are a real person.
 You have just set up your Microsoft account, but before you can use Microsoft services, you must verify the email address (username) you entered. Open the email sent to the email address you registered as username and click the link given to confirm. Your account has been created and verified. You can now use Microsoft services with the account.

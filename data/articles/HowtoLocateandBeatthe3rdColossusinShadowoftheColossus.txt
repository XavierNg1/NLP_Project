 Wait for Agro to arrive and press ∆ to ride.;
, Look around until you find the direction where the light beams centralize, which should be around the Shrine of Worship .
 The dirt bridge is the same one you used when you traveled to the second colossus, but instead of heading down the branching path at the end, head up.
 Keep traveling until you find a path between the mountains, go through this path until you arrive at a very creepy-looking lake with a large platform at the middle of it.
 Swim toward the fallen walkway at the left side of the lake and climb onto it.
 Then keep moving toward the right side of the ledge until you get to the next side, and jump to the platform.


Be extremely careful while jumping across the platforms; it's a real pain to swim back to the walkway, and the lake looks really creepy.
 Once there, a cut scene will play, and Gaius will attack you.
 This is your first priority, you won't be able to progress on this battle unless you do this.
 There are two possibilities here: if Gaius is too close, he will attempt to stomp you or he will use his sword.


If Gaius is too close and tries to stomp on you, run across the arena and lure him away from the platform.
Once you get some distance between him and the platform, he will attempt to use his sword and crush you—this is what you want!

, This will cause him to strike the platform you were standing on, which will destroy his arm armor and reveal fur.
 After he hits the ground, immediately run toward Gaius and jump on his sword and onto his arm.
 This is where the first magic circle is.
 Remember to let your strike charge before attempting to stab the magic circle.
 Go around and climb the fur on his stomach.
 Another magic circle will appear on his stomach once the magic circle on his head disappears. Charge up your sword and attack the magic circle here until he dies.

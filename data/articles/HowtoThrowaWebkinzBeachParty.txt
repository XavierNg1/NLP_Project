 They're in most craft stores, like Hallmark, but you can also go to big chain stores, like Kmart and Sears.;
, You can get little Frisbee or smaller buckets and pails.
 Don't take up the whole house but it can be nicer when you just take up a little room. There's less decorating and more fun!

, Don't overdo it, either, or it could get expensive.
 Fill some buckets with sand and let your guests make their own things. This works best if you have a sandbox. If you are indoors or out, ask your parents before you cover everything in sand!

, If you are leaving them in the water, make sure you are placing them on something that will support weight. It would also be cute if you find little children's floaties and put them in there. Make sure the Webkinz are wearing clothes that water wouldn't ruin.
 Make sure to include the day, time, and R.S.V.P. date. You could also ask your pals to bring their Webkinz with them!

Ice cream or Popsicle
Iced coffee or Frappuccinos
Fruit salad
Cheese curls

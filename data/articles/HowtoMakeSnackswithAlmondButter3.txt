 Add half a can of coconut milk to a blender, as well as 1/2 a teaspoon of cardamom and 3 tablespoons of almond butter. Blend it together well, adding honey or maple syrup to taste, if you want. For a colder beverage, throw in a ice cube or two when blending.If cardamom isn't your thing, try cinnamon, ginger, or nutmeg to taste.
 Almond butter makes a great addition to a smoothie. It adds protein, as well as provides thickness to the smoothie. Try adding it in after you've blended your fruits and veggies with a liquid and blend until smooth.
 Mix together a 1/2 cup of whole milk and a 1/4 cup of cream in a small saucepan. Heat it over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes, until it's hot. It should be simmering, not boiling. Add in 5 ounces of chocolate (chopped or mini chocolate chips). Stir until the chocolate has melted, then add in a tablespoon of almond butter. Whisk again until smooth.You can use lower-fat milk, but the end result won't be as thick and creamy.

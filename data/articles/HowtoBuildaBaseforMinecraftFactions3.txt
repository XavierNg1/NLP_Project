 This is the most time consuming part of the whole process, as you are going to need enough obsidian to create a protective shell around your base. This will protect you completely from tnt cannoning, the most common method of destroying protected bases. It also makes tunnelling into your base inefficient, as it makes your attackers mine every single obsidian block to enter., If you are underground, this means people cannot just tunnel downward into your base, or they will die in the lava surrounding your base. This also acts as a protectant against x-rayers, as they will only see the lava and not the chests underneath them most of the time. This will not work in high in the sky bases, as the lava will flow down and reveal your base., If you had to dig down to get to your base, smelt some stone and build it back up, cobblestone will just let people know somebody was there. If you built straight up to your base, remove the blocks that build up to your base. The point here is to make people to not suspect that anyone was here, and that they will move on without seeing your base., There are a multitude of traps you can make, as many as you can think of. Here is just a list of ideas to get you started.

Minefields. Put wood or stone pressure pads on wood or stone blocks, and then put tnt below them. As people step on them they will explode.
Cobwebs. You can simply put these up, or you can dig a hole with cobwebs then a block of lava, making your victim watch helplessly as they fall to their death.
Cacti. Putting cacti in an "X" pattern can surprise players, and make them slowly pass through all of the cacti before they can reach you.

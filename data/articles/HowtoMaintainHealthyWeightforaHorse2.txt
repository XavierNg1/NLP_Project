 If your horse is too thin, there are a variety of reasons that they may not gain weight easily. Not all of the reasons are due to the horse's health either. Just like humans, some horses have faster metabolism than others, and thus, have a hard time keeping on weight.Have your horse examined by a veterinarian, especially if they seem to have lost weight recently for no obvious reason. They may be able to point to an underlying cause of the weight loss or with difficulty putting on weight.
Be sure to get your horse regular dental checks, too. The horse should have its teeth floated at least once a year to avoid sharp points and keep it comfortable. Horses with mouth sores are less likely to eat and may lose weight.
 This should be the main piece of any horse’s diet and can be provided in the form of hay, pasture, or a legume feed. High-quality forage is imperative for the digestive health of your horse.Increasing the amount of quality of forage in a horse’s diet is often the first step in helping your horse gain weight.
A horse that lives on forage alone often eats 2 or 3% of their body weight in forage each day.
 If your horse doesn’t seem to be gaining the weight needed after changes in forage, consider adding more fat to their diet. Typically, this can be done by adding oil to their diets. Be sure to add oil in gradually so as not to upset the horse’s digestive system.Many experts recommend starting with a one-quarter cup of oil per feed and increasing this amount gradually up to a maximum of one cup of oil per feeding.
Good fat sources include corn, soybean, and rice bran.

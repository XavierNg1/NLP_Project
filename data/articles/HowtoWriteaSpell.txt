 Decide on the result you want to accomplish with the spell.
 Timing when casting spells can be important. The Moon is important in witchcraft, and therefore has a profound influence upon us. It is very important to choose the right moon phase for your spell; magical workings for gain, increase or bringing things to you, should be initiated when the moon is waxing (from new to full); when the moon is waning (from full to dark), then its time for magical workings of decrease or sending away. The highest energy occurs at the full moon, and therefore this is the most powerful time for magical workings. The new moon is the next most powerful time for magic.
 There is a natural time for starting things (a planting time), for maturing things (a growing time), for reaping things (a harvest time) and, of course, a time for rest and planning.
 Make sure that you have all the tools that you need for casting the spell. Your tools must have no inherent magic. They are to help you create a mood. You also have to clean your tools. Don't forget to cleanse and bless (consecrate) your tools before you begin casting your spell.
 Remember that magic is the manipulation of energy, a thought is a form of energy and a visualization is an even stronger form of energy. Your visualization can be a method used to intensify further and direct your will. Your visualization can be the method by which you control the magical energy you have produced. You must know what you want. You must see it. You must feel the high energy flow. You must direct it.
 For making your words and thoughts stronger you can write your spell into a rhyme to be spoken aloud; this makes it easier to remember your spell, you can also chant your spell to raise energy.
 Read over your spell, and be sure that if abides by your personal ethics and morals. For instance, if you are Wiccan, it is important to remember and abide by the Three Fold Law.

 If your ex has always reciprocated your flirty behavior, and now suddenly they don’t, this can indicate they are spending their flirtatious energy on their new love.

Try flirting with them the way you normally would (don't overdo it) and gauge their reaction.
See if this happens more than once before you draw any conclusions.
 If your ex suddenly grows distant from you, this can be a sign that they’ve moved on. If they longer share details from their life, no longer reach out to you for support, or no longer allow themselves to be close to you physically, they may be in love with someone.

Try to find out if there is something else bothering them that might make them act distant.
 If you have made plans with your ex a while ago, and suddenly they begin cancelling them, this could be sign that they’ve fallen for someone. One cancellation might not mean anything, but several in a row could be a bad sign., If you used to be able to call on your ex for company, support, or just to catch up, but suddenly they don’t seem to have time for you, they may have moved on. If they are spending all of their time with their new love, it makes it difficult for them to spend time with you.Also notice if they occasionally come calling on you for some type of attention or support, but are not there to reciprocate when you need them.
This can also mean that they have started a new relationship, but they still come to you in times of loneliness (which reflects poorly on their character).
 If you and ex had remained “friends with benefits” since your official break-up, and suddenly they have ceased this side of your relationship, this is a pretty strong sign that they are having this need filled by someone else. If they have fallen in love with someone else, they likely can’t continue being affectionate with you.


If they turn down your advances, you may want to simply ask them point blank what has changed.

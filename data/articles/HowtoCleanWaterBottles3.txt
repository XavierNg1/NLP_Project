 Place the water bottle in the dishwasher, separating the lid from the bottle. Put the bottle on the dishwashing rack upside down, with the mouth facing downward.Run the bottle through the dishwasher on the gentle or normal cycle. The cycle should include a drying phase, where the bottle is dried well in the dishwasher.
 To avoid the buildup of germs and bacteria, get in the habit of cleaning the bottle every few days.

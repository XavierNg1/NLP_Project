 (Remove any ties or ribbons, artificial flowers or other decorative items that may be tied, wired, or glued to the basket. Remove all contents from inside the basket.);
, Give the basket a good brushing with a small household brush to remove soil or dust. (Do not use a dusting spray or furniture polish. If the basket has excess soil, wash it with ordinary dish detergent in warm water. Allow it to thoroughly dry – inside and out – before you apply the new finish.)

, Repair them if you’re able with carpenter’s glue, raffia, wire or any product compatible with the fiber content of the basket.
 (See tips.) Stir the stain (or shake it) thoroughly to mix the colorant throughout the can.
 Beginning on the inside and on the bottom of the basket, apply the stain. Start with back and forth strokes across the reeds, then "push" the brush bristles into the reeds, forcing stain between the reeds. Yes, the stain will drip through the bottom of the basket. Reload your brush as needed.
 (For an easier reach, lay the basket on its side; apply stain to the new "bottom" side, periodically repositioning the basket as needed to completely stain the interior.)

, Stain the bottom first, then the exterior sides of the basket. If your basket has a handle, do the handle last.
 Tap additional stain into those missed areas with the brush.

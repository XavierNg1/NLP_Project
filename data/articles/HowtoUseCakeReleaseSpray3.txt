 To make a homemade cake release mixture that you spread on the pan in stead of spray, you'll need a mixing bowl, mixing spoon, storage container, pastry brush, and these ingredients:1 cup (125 g) of all-purpose flour
1 cup (205) of solid vegetable shortening
1 cup (237 ml) of vegetable oil

, Measure out all of the ingredients into your mixing bowl. Use the mixing spoon to stir the flour, shortening, and oil together until they're completely combined and smooth.To quickly mix up a large amount of cake release spray, you can place the ingredients in the blender and blitz them on low speed until the mixture is smooth.
 Take a silicone brush or pastry brush with bristles and dip it into the cake release mixture. Brush the mixture over the entire surface of your baking pan. Ensure that you coat the bottom, the sides, and the inner edges of the pan.Don't worry about applying too much cake release mixture. You won't be able to see it on the baked and cooled cakes.
 Transfer the cake release mixture to a sealable container that is airtight. You can keep the mixture in your pantry or cupboard for several months. You don't need to refrigerate the mixture, but you will need to stir it well before you use it again.You could store the mixture in a sealed mason jar or an airtight plastic container.

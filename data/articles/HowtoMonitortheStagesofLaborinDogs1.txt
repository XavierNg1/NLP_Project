 The normal gestation period for a dog is approximately 63 days (give or take 7 days) from the time of breeding. You should take your dog to the vet twenty to thirty days after breeding to determine if the dog is pregnant. A veterinarian can determine if a dog is pregnant by feeling their abdomen or conducting an ultrasound. Gestation periods differ slightly depending on the breed. For example, smaller breeds will often deliver after 63 days and larger breeds may deliver before 63 days.Ask your veterinarian to give you an approximate due date for your dog.
Also get their on-call number so that you can contact the vet in case of an emergency during labor.;
, Take your dog’s temperature once a day starting about a week or two before the due date. This will allow you to learn the normal temperature of your dog. Typically, the normal body temperature for a dog is somewhere between 99 and 102.5 degrees. This will vary depending on the size of the dog. Labour will begin about 24 hours after a drastic drop in temperature occurs. For example, when the dog’s temperature drops below 99 degrees. In order to take the dog’s temperature, you can use an oral human thermometer.
Simply lubricate the thermometer with vaseline and insert it into the dog’s rectum. Make sure it is about an inch inside and leave it there for one minute to get a proper reading.
Take the dog’s temperature at the same time each day.
 If the dog does not enter into active labour within 24 hours of their temperature dropping, then you should call your vet. This may be a sign of a complication and you may need professional medical assistance.

 This is probably the most polite way in eating a pizza. It's also helpful in times where you have a load of toppings and want to taste everything in one bite.;
, Put the two sides together, so it'll create a "U" shape at the crust. If you have several loose toppings, especially at the bottom, you may need to either pick them off or hold them in place as you move it towards your mouth.
 If you want to eat the toppings separately than having it on the dough or picky with what came with the pizza, you may want to do this. Many pizza places have combo varieties, such as Pizza Hut's "Meat Lover's" where the whole pizza comes with six different kinds of meat products. What if you weren't specifically sure of the toppings and didn't like a particular one?

, Many people prefer this way since it's the easiest method to eat a slice. Despite if toppings fall off or the melted cheese stretches, things get devoured nonetheless. Just place the pointed end in your mouth and chomp away.
 Who said that pizza needs to be eaten from the bottom part? Bite into a piece of crust along with a piece of the actual pizza to blend both items together.
 Use your favorite dipping sauces, such as buttermilk or ranch dressing. For this, you must use dipping etiquette and go against "double dipping" if sharing with someone else. Break the crust in pieces, dip, and pop into your mouth.
 Take all or half of your cheese and toppings off the pizza slice, set them to the side and eat the rest of the slice - except for the crust. Then open your crust (works well with thick varieties), take out extra dough and put in your cheese and toppings. Fold to keep everything in and eat. This is good for people who aren't fond of plain crust but love pizza.

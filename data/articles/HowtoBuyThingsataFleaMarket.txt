If you are looking for a particular item (e.g. a table, lamp, box of baseball cards), ensure that the flea market you plan to attend is likely to have such merchandise.;
,, This will allow you to see all available goods.
 Many flea markets and vendors do not accept credit cards or checks.



If possible, ask the vendor if he or she can hold items. This will give you the opportunity to survey other goods before making a decision.
 Pick out your items carefully and only after surveying other viable options.


If you have a smart phone, perform a search on the specific item you are interested in. This is a good way to test the authenticity of the item, and to determine whether or not you are getting a competitive price.
 Be reasonable (i.e. do not suggest an amount far below the asking price).

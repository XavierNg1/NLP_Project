 Don't say it multiple times. Try not to be repetitive... (as you might be able to tell, it gets boring and annoying). A lot of people will start skipping over a lot of your email that way.;
, Being vague just leads to misunderstandings and no true delivery of information. Use numbers and specifics instead of adverbs and adjectives. "The project is behind schedule with all of the important tasks," is not as clear as "The project is a month late delivering the yoyos to the factory in New York." (If you don't have numbers, still get rid of the adverbs and adjectives.)

, Does your reader know that delivery of the yo-yos are required so that the company can collect what it's owed? If you're not sure, remind them.
 Should those yoyos get shipped because the delay is embarrassing for the company, because it's costing children their ability to play with the yo-yos, or because it's costing the company tens of millions of dollars? Maybe all three, but one of those reasons (and it depends on your reader) will be enough to get the yoyos on the road.
 The best emails are ones that don't have a lot of vague parts to it. They concentrate on one thing.
 "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times" works for Dickens, not status reports.
,, A lot of your readers might be on an iPhone or Blackberry and not have a lot of 'room' to see. Don't make them scroll down a page or two.
 Looking back at it when everything isn't so fresh in your mind can help you improve the email considerably.

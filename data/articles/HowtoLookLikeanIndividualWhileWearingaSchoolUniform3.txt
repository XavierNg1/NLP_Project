 Schools do not approve of turning your long skirt into a mini-skirt. Definitely find out the preferred length so that you don't break dress code.


If you can, get your skirt tailored. Make sure your skirt is straight, and that you get the right measurements. If you know somebody who can actually sew, then ask them to tailor it for you.
 Although this could mean that you have to push the school rules boundaries a little, just don't blatantly cross them.

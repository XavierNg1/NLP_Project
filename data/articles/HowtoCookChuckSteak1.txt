 Turn the oven on to 325 degrees F (162 C). Place 2 tablespoons of vegetable or canola oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Heat the oil over medium heat and sprinkle the chuck steak with salt and pepper.


You could use a big skillet if your chuck steaks are thin.;
, Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add the seasoned steak to the Dutch oven. The steak will sizzle as soon as you add it to the pot. Let the steak cook on medium heat until it browns. Use tongs to turn the steak so that it browns on all sides. Use the tongs to take the steaks out of the pot once they're seared. Pour off and discard any fat from the pan.Wear oven mitts when searing the steak since the hot oil may sputter.
 Pour in about 3/4 of a cup of liquid. This will keep the chuck steak moist as it cooks and will make it even more tender. Try using one of the following as braising liquids:Beef or vegetable broth
Apple juice or cider
Cranberry juice
Tomato juice
Dry wine mixed with broth
Water
1 tablespoon of a liquid seasoning like barbecue sauce, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, steak sauce or Worcestershire sauce (You can add these to water to dilute them.)

, To add even more flavor to your braised chuck steak, stir in dried herbs of your choice. You'll need to stir in about 1 teaspoon of dried herbs or 1 tablespoon of fresh herbs. You can use herbs like:


Basil
Herbes de Provence
Italian seasoning
Oregano
Thyme

, Cover the Dutch oven with a heavy lid and place the steak in the oven. For 2 1/2 to 3 pounds of chuck steak, bake the steak for 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1 hour and 45 minutes. The chuck steak will be completely tender when it's finished braising and ready to serve. If you check the temperature, the steak should be between 145 degrees F (62 C) for medium-rare and 175 F (79 C) for well-done.To check tenderness, insert a fork or knife into the steak. If tender, the fork or knife should slide in easily.

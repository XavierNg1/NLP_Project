 This method of napkin folding is quick, simple, and easy to duplicate, making it a good choice for beginners. To start, lay your napkin flat on your table or work surface. Flatten out any folds or creases you see.


Note that this method works best with large, square, cloth napkins. For the nicest-looking results, use napkins without wrinkles, stains, or frayed ends.;
, Pinch the very center of the napkin between your thumb and forefinger. Lift it up so that it's not touching the table or work surface. The napkin should hang below your hand in gentle, flowing folds.
 If needed, use your free hand to straighten out the folds of the napkin so that it hangs freely. Alternatively, shake it up and down a few times with the hand you're pinching it with.


When you're done, the napkin should hang downward loosely like a pair of drapes.
 Grasp the middle section of the napkin with your free hand to hold it in place. Then, use the hand you were pinching the napkin with to slide the ring over the napkin's folded end and pull it through.


If possible, push your ring up the napkin until it's held in place by the bulk of the napkin. Not all napkins are thick enough for this — if yours isn't, just slide the ring up an inch or two and set the napkin down.
 Next, simply puff up the unfolded end of the napkin to give it some visually appealing volume — this is easiest with hefty cloth napkins. For added panache, give the smaller bottom part of the napkin a quick fluffing as well. Congratulations! You're done. Arrange your napkin as you wish.


There are many different ways you can arrange your napkins for maximum impact — for instance, you may want to place your napkin directly on a plate to draw attention to it or put them all in a basket in the middle of the table so that your guests can grab them as they need them. It's up to you!

Pull your fishing line through the hole that you created until it reaches the end of the thread or line. Once you don’t have any fishing line left, tie a tight knot around the bottom knot of the balloon. This will be the start of your garland., Continue to lace your needle and thread through other knots at the bottom of your blown up balloons.

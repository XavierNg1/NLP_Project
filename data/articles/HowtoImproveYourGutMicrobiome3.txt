 Exercise is a great way to stimulate your gut microbiome, as it helps to increase blood flow and massages your digestive tract. Massaging your digestive tract will allow your body to release toxins and properly digest your food.Do exercise like walking, running, yoga, Tai Chi, housework, yardwork and gardening. You can also take up a sport like tennis, basketball, baseball, softball, hockey, lacrosse, or football. Work out on a stationary bicycle, an elliptical machine, or a rowing machine.
 Though antibiotics are useful for killing off bad bacteria in our body, they also kill off good bacteria needed to aid in digestion. If possible, talk to your doctor about taking medication other than antibiotics, as they can negatively affect your gut microbiome. If you do need to take antibiotics, make sure you also take probiotic supplements so your body contains the bacteria it needs to stay healthy., Maintain a healthy gut microbiome by reducing unhealthy habits like smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol. Try to limit your drinking to a few drinks a week and try to quit smoking, if you do smoke.
 Your doctor can monitor your gut microbiome and let you know if there are any issues with your digestion that could be linked to an unhealthy gut microbiome. Talk to your doctor about your gut microbiome during your yearly or bi-yearly check up, especially if you have low energy, digestive issues, or poor immunity to illness and disease.

 Consider the cupcake recipe that you'd like to adapt. If you left out the egg or eggs from your recipe, would the batter be dry? Cupcake batters should be smooth and somewhat runny. If your batter would be dry, you need to substitute the eggs for a different ingredient that will provide moisture to the batter. Consider increasing the baking soda/baking powder by 25 to 50 percent and replacing 1 egg with:Fruit juice
1/4 cup of milk or water
1/4 cup of fruit puree (like mashed bananas, unsweetened applesauce, pureed prunes or dates)

, Instead of using eggs in your recipe, mix together equal parts of plain yogurt and silken tofu until they're completely combined. Use 1/4 cup of this mixture to equal 1 egg in your cupcake recipe.You shouldn't use this as an egg replacer if you recipe calls for 3 or more eggs. If the recipe calls for a lot of eggs, just use an egg substitute product.
 You can buy a commercial egg substitute from the grocery store (in the baking aisle). Follow the manufacturer's instructions to mix it up. You'll probably have to stir together 1 1/2 tablespoons of the dry egg substitute powder with 2 to 3 tablespoons of warm water to equal one egg.Egg substitute is a good choice is you're worried about other types of substitutions changing the flavor of your recipe. Egg substitute won't change the flavor of your cupcakes.

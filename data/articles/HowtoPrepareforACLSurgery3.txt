 Typically, you will be instructed to fast for at least 12 hours prior to your appointed hour of surgery. Fasting will reduce the chances of nausea or throwing up during surgery, which can be triggered by some types of anesthesia.


Fasting includes gum, mints, and other small items.
You can brush your teeth; just do not swallow any of the water or toothpaste.
 You will be discouraged from driving home after the surgery, due to residual effects of the anesthesia. Arrange a driver so you can get home after you are discharged without any delay.


Your driver can also help you get your medications from the pharmacy on the way home.
 Try to avoid placing anything on your body that could inadvertently interfere with the surgical procedure. This includes jewelry, makeup, perfume, cologne, lotions, etc. Also, wear glasses instead of contacts, as your eyes may be dried out during the surgery.
 To expedite the process of registration and make sure you are ready for surgery on time, make sure to bring the required items. Bringing these items and having them on hand will save you time digging through your bags or returning home to get them. Bring:


A photo ID (driverâ€™s license or state identification card).
Your health insurance card.
A form of payment if another arrangement has not already been made.
A list of the medications you are taking, the dosage and time of the day that you take them.
You should also bring a list of the medications you are allergic or have had a reaction to.
Walker or crutches, if necessary.
Bring a case for your glasses, dentures and hearing aid, if applicable. All of these items will be removed prior to surgery.

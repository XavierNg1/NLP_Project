 Starting with your broadest "road map" will provide important insight into how you should allocate your time.


What state standards are you required to fulfill in this course?
What are your district's course curriculum requirements?
What are your students' specific needs and learning styles? Consider broad factors such as demographics and past assessment data, but also trust your instincts as you consider the dynamics of your student population.
A broad "road map" allows you to circumvent common pitfalls such as running short on instructional time. When planning a post-Civil War U.S. history course, for example, if you begin with the understanding that you'll end the course in 2001 you can plot out a series of units that will enable you to reach that goal.
 These questions will form the superstructure of your course content.


Identify key content, skills, and vocabulary. What will your students need to know when they exit your course?
Develop ways of assessing your students to determine whether they are learning this information. Remember to diversify your assessment tools; some students will respond better to certain forms of assessment than others.
Design a structure that will place these essential questions in a proper learning sequence. Now you have your units, and can focus upon specific lesson plans.
Determine what materials you'll need to properly teach these concepts and skills.
 Remember to leave room for adjustment; some units will proceed more smoothly than others. Generally speaking, however, too much preparation is better than not enough -- plan with the understanding that you may need to trim extra detail. A wise approach will focus on key concepts and then supplement with supporting material that can be sacrificed if necessary.

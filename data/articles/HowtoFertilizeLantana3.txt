 Container-grown lantana should be given houseplant fertilizer for flowering plants with a 5-10-5 ratio once each month.A higher middle number, which is phosphorus, will help promote more profuse flowering.
A container-grown lantana must be given houseplant fertilizer. Garden fertilizer will burn the roots because it is too strong.
 When grown in a container, a lantana needs more frequent applications of fertilizer because it is watered more often than lantana planted in the ground.


With such frequent irrigation, the fertilizer is washed out of the soil quickly.
 Do not give fertilizer solution to a dry lantana as it will burn the roots.
 A common dilution rate is 1 teaspoon of liquid fertilizer per quart of water but this varies, depending on the fertilizer formula. Follow the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations.


Water it generously until the water flows freely from the bottom of the container to help wash excess fertilizer from the soil. After the lantana recovers and begins growing again, only give it fertilizer every six to eight weeks.
 If the leaves on the lantana turn yellow it is probably due to lack of nutrients. Increase the application frequency to twice each month.


If it stops growing and blooming or if the leaves wilt and develop dry brown edges, it is getting too much fertilizer.

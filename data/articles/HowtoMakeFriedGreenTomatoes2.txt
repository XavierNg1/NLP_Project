 These should be the same sort of tomatoes you would purchase for normal fried tomatoes. Slice the tomatoes into evenly sized discs. Generally cutting them into thirds or fourths work best.
 In a large bowl, combine one cup of flour, one tablespoon of cornstarch, and ¼ teaspoon of baking powder. You can also add any herbs you would like, as well as salt and pepper. Pour half a can of dark beer and a ½ cup of cold water into the dry mixture. Stir this mixture together.Dark beer such as a lager or an ale works best but if you only have lighter beers or ambers on hand, those should work fine as well.
 You should only pour about ½ an inch of oil into the skillet. The oil can either be vegetable oil or canola oil. Make sure the oil is fully heated by dropping a pinch of the batter into the oil. If it sizzles and immediately creates bubbles, the oil is perfectly heated.
 Make sure to coat both sides of the tomatoes evenly. Because the batter will be relatively thin and slippery, you will need to dip the tomatoes in and make sure they are coated really well.
 You will then need to transfer them immediately to the frying pan to ensure that none of the batter drips off. You should fry them for about three minutes or until they are golden brown.
 Place them on a plate or pan that has been covered in paper towels. This will ensure that the excess oil drains off and the tomatoes become extra crispy.
 Note that these are awesome when served with a dipping sauce like Ranch or marinara.

 Gather as many boxes as you can get a hold of, from cereal boxes to packages. All of these are needed for making a good clubhouse.;
, Fool around with a few ideas by stacking the boxes in different places, decide what you like best.


Make sure you plan according to your rat's mobility. For instance, if you have an older rat, you might want to stick with a single story clubhouse or a two story house with wide bridges and wide ramps.
 Please be careful when cutting holes, as slipping can hurt quite badly. Make sure that there is a way to get into every box.



Allow the boxes to dry before continuing.






Be sure not to nudge the boxes out of place while drying.



Ramps can be made out of thick, clean sticks or pieces of wood. (Make sure there are no splinters!)






Ladders can be made out of thick rope, or parrot ladders available at nearly any pet store.






Bridges can be made out of thick rope, pieces of wood, or anything else that is strong and sturdy.






Just be sure to stabilize these to avoid injury to your rats. You can take a half filled water bottle to test out bridges. Press lightly on ramps and ladders, just about how much you think your rat would pull.
 Personalize it in every way you can think of! Non toxic markers are the best way.

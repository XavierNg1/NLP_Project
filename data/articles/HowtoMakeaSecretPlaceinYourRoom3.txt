 Don't show your space to anyone or it won't be secret anymore.


If you have siblings, try to lock your door to keep them from your secret space. If that’s not an option, talk to you parents about helping you keep the secret space yours.
If someone does happen to discover your space, talk to them and explain that it is your secret personal area—they will most likely understand.
 Now that you’ve created a secret space, be sure to use it as you intended. You’ve worked hard and now you can sit back and appreciate it.


Keep it clean. If your secret space gets cluttered, it won’t be comfortable. Be sure to keep it clear so that you can relax.
Keep it stocked with refreshments, new magazines, or anything else you might need in your secret space.
 While you may be in a very busy house, try to keep your secret space a spot where you can focus (even if you’re focusing on relaxing).


If you chose a spot with a window, use a lightweight curtain to block out excessive heat or outside noises.
Keep headphones in your secret space to block out the noisiness in the house.
Consider leaving your phone out of your secret spot. If it’s there, keep it on silent.
 Now that you have your secret spot, you can spend a lot of time in it, but don’t become a hermit. Spending all of your time alone is not good for you.


Interacting with family and neighbors keeps you safe, healthy, and happy. If you start spending all of your time alone in your secret space, they may start to worry.
Your secret space is yours and you don’t have to answer any questions about it. They will respect your privacy as long as you continue to be a part of their lives.

 Some things you need are your school clothes, supplies, and anything else you think is necessary. If you don't have everything you may not perform as well .Remember to double check at home and review the list!;
, Start with clearing out your closet. Clothes that don't fit you anymore give them away to others! Clothes that are torn, ripped, or damaged should be thrown away. This should help you store much more clothing you'll need! Going shopping alone can be difficult. Have somebody else tag alongside with you to help out! The best people to bring with you is someone who is in or was in Middle School. They know what it's like.Make sure they are approved by your parents.
 School supply shopping is a little harder than clothes shopping. To have everything you need, copy the supply list down from your school's website or a good list that you think you'll need! The best way to save money on shopping is to go to a cheaper store like the Dollar Tree, (etc.)! But anyway you should get what is really needed. Like pencils, pens, erasers, binders, highlighters,(etc.)!

, On orientation day, look around (if they don't give you tours). Listen to your principal and teachers of classes you have to take, you'll get a feel for what they expect, personality and how they want things done.

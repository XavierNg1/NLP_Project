, If it is old enough, odds are someone has sampled it. You will notice a sound occurring in many different songs, all seeming to have the same origin. If you listen to Heavy D & The Boyz (and who doesn't?) and on the song 'Don't Curse' you hear that funky brass and drum combo looped throughout, you owe that pleasure to The J.B.'s, one of the most sampled groups of all time (you've probably already Google them by this point), and that particular sample comes from their (awesome) 'Pass the Peas', a very funky song.
 What this means is that use only sample songs that sound great, but are lesser known. If someone sampled something from The Beatles, you get your, uh, butt handed to you. Intense pressure from record labels, and the corporate Pitbulls under their employ, have caused more lawsuits than 3 Million R. Kelly's.
 It can be a cheesy old George Romero horror film from the 1960s, or a mad sitarist from Calcutta. If it sounds cool, and can be cleared, use it. Why not.
 If a sample is iffy, put it deep in the mix. It is kind of sneaky, but if something from Led Zeppelin is just UNAVOIDABLE, put it under 500 other sounds, and hope no one notices.
 Another idea for samples, both clear, and iffy, is to mix it up. Add effects. Add distortion, flanger, chorus, reverb, spacer, vocalizer, echo, slow it down, speed it up! The music world is your oyster.
 If one sample doesn't work out with the rest, a key good side is that there are almost an INFINITE amount of songs to sample.

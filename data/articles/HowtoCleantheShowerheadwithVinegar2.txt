 If you cannot remove your showerhead, you can still soak it using vinegar and a plastic bag. Here is what you will need:


A plastic bag large enough to fit over your showerhead
A piece of string or a twist tie
Distilled white vinegar
An old toothbrush
Soft cloth, such as microfiber or flannel

, Do not fill it all the way, or the vinegar will pour out when you try to put the showerhead into it.
 Hold the bag under the showerhead and pull it open. Slowly bring it upwards until it is covering the showerhead and the showerhead is in the vinegar.
 You can do this by holding the top of the bag tightly around the neck of the showerhead, and then tying a piece of string or a twist tie tightly around it. Carefully let go of the bag and make sure that it won't fall off before stepping away.
 The dirtier your showerhead is, the longer it will have to soak. If the showerhead is made from brass, or has a gold or nickel coating, then take the bag off after 30 minutes. You can always repeat the process after you have rinsed the showerhead.
 Hold the bag with one hand and carefully untie it with the other. Tip the bag over and empty out the vinegar. Be careful not to let the vinegar splash into your eyes.
 This will flush out any mineral deposits that might be stuck inside the showerhead.
 Focus on the base of the showerhead, where the water comes out, as this is the area that will get the most buildup. Turn the water back on again to flush more residue out. Keep scrubbing the showerhead and turning the water on until you cannot see anymore mineral residue.
 You can use a microfiber cloth or a piece of flannel. Gently buff the surface of the showerhead with the cloth until it is dry and you can no longer see any water spots.

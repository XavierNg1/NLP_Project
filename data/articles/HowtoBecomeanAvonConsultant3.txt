 After meeting with the local Avon consultant, your registration paperwork will be sent to the Avon office for processing. After you have been accepted into the program, you will be sent an Avon kit with brochures, training materials, and various Avon product samples.
 As an Avon consultant, you can sell Avon products using any method you choose; including hosting Avon parties, selling Avon products online, distributing brochures throughout your local community, and more.


Review the Avon training materials and resources to find additional tips and strategies for getting started with selling Avon products. For example, if you want to sell Avon on the Internet, consult with your training materials to learn when you can attend an Avon training course for selling products online.

 (You can draw any lovely animal really, such as a chicken, a lamb, a deer, etc.).
 Attach a tube from the mouth. Use a strong tape like duct tape to attach to the bunny's mouth, attaching it from behind.


Use kitchen paper rolls, nylon fabric tubing, etc. for this part. Whatever you use though, has to be large enough for the sort of eggs you're using, be they chocolate, blown-out or plastic eggs. Test before making the tube.
 Set the board in front of a trampoline. Rest the tube's open end on the trampoline and a basket right near the tube.
 Roll eggs through the bunny's mouth, down the tube, landing on the trampoline and, depending on the force with which the egg is tossed down the mouth, it may bounce into the basket. Do a few runs to see where to best place the basket.
 There are two possible ways to approach here:


Blindfold guests. Have them find and place the eggs into the bunny's mouth. The force for bouncing the egg at the end will have to come entirely from how they flick their wrists, roll the egg, or whatever they choose to do.
Don't blindfold guests. Instead, place a line on the ground they must stand behind and toss the egg into the mouth from. Don't use blown-out eggs for this, as they'll soon break!

, If any eggs make it into the basket, that person is a winner and gets a special prize. Getting the egg down the tube is also noteworthy.


If very young children are playing, even an egg stuck in the tunnel deserves a prize.

 Even small amounts of pesticides can wreak havoc on bees' navigational abilities and cause them to get lost when returning to the nest. Foraging bees may carry pesticides back to the nest, where they end up in the honey and thus damage upcoming generations of bees.


Use natural methods of pest-control in your bee garden, if necessary.

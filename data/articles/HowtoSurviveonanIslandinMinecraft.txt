Try to find the ocean. This is where most islands are.
Then look around the water you see for an island. Swim over to it when you think you see one and make sure it's an island.;

Most islands are small, with some trees and lots of grass.



Now you can use the wood to make a whole set of wooden tools (wooden tool recipes in the Related wikiHows).

Mine all the grass. Some of the grass should drop seeds.
Make a hoe. You will need it to turn the ground into farmland.
Right-click the dirt next to the water with the hoe. Then right click the same place with the seeds. Then you should see the wheat growing.
When the wheat is fully grown it is mostly yellow with little black dots at the top. When it is fully grown, click it with the hoe.
Once you have 3 wheats put a horizontal line of wheat. It should give you bread. Take it. This can be your food source and you can also eat meat you got from killing animals.
 Once you have enough sugar cane, just put most of it in the crafting table and then it should give you sugar. Grab it. Replant the rest of it so you can get more sugarcane to make sugar with.
 The endless process.


The trees you cut down should of dropped some saplings. Get them and plant them. Cut them down and get more saplings. Repeat this process till you stop playing that server.



You will need it (see Related wikiHows for instructions on building it).



To make it you just need to put 5 wood planks in the shape of an upside down helmet.
This will make it easier to get to the main land.
This is the end of this small easy guide.

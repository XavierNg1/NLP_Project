 The cost is $45, and you have 60 days to marry before the document becomes void.


You have to be 18 years of age to marry in Vermont without parental permission. Those who are 16 and 17 years old can marry with parental consent, and no one under the age of 16 is allowed to marry in the state of Vermont.
You have to be of sound mind, and if you are under a guardianship, you must have the consent of the guardian.
If both of you are residents of Vermont, you can go to either person's town clerk. If only one of you is a resident, you have to go to that person's town clerk. And if neither of you are residents, you can go to any town clerk to obtain your Vermont marriage license.
Information that you will need to provide to the clerk includes both of your names, where you reside, and where and when you were born. You will also need to give the clerk's office your parents' names, your mothers' maiden names, as well as your parents' places of birth.
If you are divorced or had a previous spouse who has passed away, you will need to provide proof of either of those facts.
A Vermont marriage license is good for the entire state.;

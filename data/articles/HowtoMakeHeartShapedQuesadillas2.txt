 Use a sharp pointed knife to cut out a heart shape over a cutting board. The heart should take up the majority of the tortilla. The smaller that you cut the heart, the smaller your quesadilla will be., You should only brush one side of the tortilla so that the other side of your quesadilla is dry and cool enough to be eaten with your hands. If you don't have a cooking brush, you can use a napkin, paper towels, or your hands to spread olive oil over the surface of your tortilla., Lay your bacon onto a hot skillet and cook each side for 7-8 minutes or until it becomes crispy and brown. If you like crispier bacon, allow it to cook for a minute or two extra on each side before taking it out of the pan. Set your bacon aside in a bowl lined with a paper towel.
 You will only need to cook one side of each piece of tortilla that you have. The heat generated from cooking that side of the tortilla will melt the cheese once you sprinkle it over the tortilla., Use a knife to cut into the Primula cheese. Primula cheese is a soft Norwegian cheese that's easily spreadable.Spread the cheese over the cooked side of the tortilla.


If you can't get Primula cheese, you can replace it with another soft spreadable cheese like Manouri, Brie, or Brillat-Savarin., Remove your bacon from the bowl that you set aside and place it over the tortilla covered in cheese. Line up the apple slices so that there's an even distribution over the tortilla., Place the other tortilla cooked side down and press down on your quesadilla. Allow it to cool for another minute before serving it. The soft cheese and bacon will add a smoky saltiness, so no seasoning is required.

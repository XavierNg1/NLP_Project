 Ultimately, the safest way to be sure is to pay a professional to have a look at the gem. He or she should be able to tell you whether or not the ruby is real.


Look up reputable jewelers in your city. Consider looking at reviews online before you visit the jeweler. Check whether other customers were satisfied with the accuracy of this person's analysis.
 A jeweler can analyze the ruby and tell you how much it is worth. Others may pay much more or much less for the gem â€“ but an appraisal is usually a good ballpark estimate of what a stone is worth in monetary value., A licensed jeweler can give you an official certification that your ruby is the real deal. This document will act as legitimizing proof should you ever decide to sell the ruby. Make a copy of the certificate and keep it in a safe, secret place.Certify your ruby for the sake of insurance. If you ever lose the ruby in a disaster or another mix-up, then you will be more likely to receive compensation for the loss if you can prove that you lost an actual ruby.
If you plan to keep the ruby, keep it as a family heirloom. When your family or friends one day inherit the ruby, it will be much more valuable if it is certified. You will also save them the trouble of going through the same steps to determine whether the ruby is real.

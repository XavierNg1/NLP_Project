 Start by allowing the package of cream cheese to soften at room temperature. Also remove the frozen whipped topping from the refrigerator and remove the lid, allowing the topping to begin thawing.;
, Use a wire whisk or a hand mixer to blend the 2 ingredients until smooth consistency is achieved. Ideally, there should be no lumps of cream cheese or pockets of sugar throughout the mixture.
 Continue to work in the peanut butter so that it gradually begins to combine with the other 2 ingredients. Slowly work in the milk in small amounts to help aid in the folding process and keep the mixture somewhat creamy.
 Once the peanut butter and milk are successfully blended into the pie filling, introduce the whipped topping into the mixture. Use a large spoon or spatula to fold in the whipped topping until it integrates with the other ingredients evenly.
 Start with the middle of the crust and use the spoon to gradually fill the bottom of the pie tin while pushing the filling toward the rim of the crust. Use circular motions that gently move the filling into position and minimize the chances of dislodging any of the graham cracker crumbs. Smooth the top of the pie to your preferences, or use the spoon or spatula to create a series of waves on the top layer of the filling.
 In most climates, the pie can be ready to cut in anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour after completion. Since the pie holds up well overnight, it can also be prepared the day before and allowed to set in a covered pie dish in the refrigerator until time to serve.

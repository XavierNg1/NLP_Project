 You will need a tourist visa for any vacation (non-business) visit to Australia, regardless of whether you are going for 1 day or 12 months. If you are vacationing with a spouse who is an Australian citizen, you will still need a visa, but must apply for a spousal visa.


Choose a short-stay visa if you plan to vacation in Australia for a maximum of 3 months.
Opt for a long-stay visa if you will be visiting for up to 12 months.;
,


Determine if you are 1 of the 33 countries eligible for the ETA. These countries can be found by visiting http://www.eta.immi.gov.au.
Choose the application for either the short-stay or long-stay visa, and fill out the necessary information. You will need a valid passport that is good through the time in which are traveling, and a major credit card. Processing time is usually immediate, and your ETA will automatically be linked to your passport.
 Those who are not within the eligible countries to apply online for a visa, or those who do not have Internet access, will need to visit a diplomatic office, such as an embassy or consulate.


Make an appointment with an Australian embassy if you are unable to apply online. A list of embassies can be found on the Australian Government website.
Ask what application fees will apply and what documentation is needed before you go to the appointment. In general, you will need a valid passport, the applications fees, the application itself, details about your reason for travel, and possibly your employment and financial status. The documentation required may vary depending on the country from which you are traveling.

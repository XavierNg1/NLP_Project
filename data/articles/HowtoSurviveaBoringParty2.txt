 If the party seems to have died down, you can keep yourself busy by playing chef. Head over to the appetizer table, grab a plate and get creative. Have fun trying to mix and match the appetizers to make new dishes. You might even try sharing some of your best creations with other party goers., If you're bored at a party, it might be time to get to work. Keeping yourself busy by playing a new role at the party can help you stay engaged and pass the time. Helping out with the party might also bring some life back into it and make things fun for everyone.You could try playing bartender and serving people drinks.
You might offer to be the party photographer and take pictures for everyone.
Try being the party's waiter and deliver snacks to the guests.
Ask to help the host out with whatever she might need.
 If you're at a dull party and the host has a pet, try playing with it to help pass the time. Throwing a ball for a dog or using a laser pointer with a cat can be fun ways for both you and the pet to get through the party. Remember to ask your host if it's okay to play with his pet before doing so., If you see two guests chatting, try to imagine what they might be saying to each other. Insert funny dialogue into their mouths (either mentally or very, very quietly to yourself) as their lips move. Or choose someone you don't know and try to make a creative backstory for him. You could also watch everyone's body language and try to guess their relationships to each other from these cues. Maybe you'll pick up that the girl at the snack table has a crush on the guy who is playing with the dog because she can't stop glancing over at him.

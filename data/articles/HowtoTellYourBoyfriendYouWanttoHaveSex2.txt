 If you are too nervous to tell you boyfriend in person or you simply want to be able to plan ahead for your first time together, texting or calling him is a good option. If you text him, you can be direct by texting something like "Wanna have sex later?" This text will certainly grab his attention but it is casual enough that you can play it off like you were kidding, just in case he says no.
Or you can try something more suggestive, tell him what you're wearing or go with the classic "What are you wearing?" This may lead to a steamy sexting session or phone call. When it feels right, ask him to come over and see what happens next.
 The next time that you alone together, use the opportunity to show him that you are ready to have sex. Make sure that you know that he is ready for sex before you do try to seduce him. If he says he is not ready yet, don’t take it personally. Just give him some more time and try again when he tells you he’s ready. , An email or handwritten note may be a perfect solution if you are having a hard time verbalizing the way that you feel. Write honestly about how you feel and keep it lighthearted.Also, make sure that he reads the note in private or in your company and that he either destroys/deletes it or keeps it somewhere very safe after he has read it.
 An upcoming special occasion, like a birthday or holiday, might be a good time to tell him that you want to start having sex. Waiting until a specified date will give you time to prepare yourself and it will also make the occasion more memorable.

 Don’t put on clothing that is bright and flashy. This will encourage people to look at you. The same goes for colorful hats or accessories. The more you seem like you want to be noticed, the more people will try to notice you. This does not mean that you must look boring. Simple clothing can be stylish!


This goes for makeup as well. Bold, brash colors can be replaced with duller tones.;
, Try not to wear anything that seems to flout the chosen mores of your society. For example, don't show too much skin if you live in a strict, religious place. You need to figure out what is correct for the situation that you are in. For example, if you go to a nude beach, you will be stared at if you wear clothing.
 Don’t draw attention to yourself. Certain conduct is going to always make people curious. For example, if you sing loudly in public, people will look at you. Therefore, don’t act in a way that makes you stand out.


Again, what is normal will be defined by the situation you find yourself in. So, if you are standing still in the middle of a loud concert, you can expect that people may look at you in an odd way.

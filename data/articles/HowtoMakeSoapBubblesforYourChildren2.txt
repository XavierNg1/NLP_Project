 The wands that you can purchase in the store are usually made from plastic, but any material with a hole in it can be used to blow bubbles. Look around the house for materials you can bend or shape into a bubble wand.


Bend the top section of a pipe cleaner into a circle shape, then bend the tip of the circle around the shaft of the pipe cleaner to create a wand.
If you have old egg-dying supplies lying around, you can use the circular egg dipper as a wand.
Bend a straw into a wand shape, and fasten the circular part with a piece of tape.
 Blowing lots of little bubbles is fun, but you can also make a large wand to blow giant bubbles. You'll need a large wand shape with a piece of mesh or screen to cover it; this helps stabilize the solution so the bubble can form without popping.


Straighten out a wire coat hanger. You may need a pair of pliers to untwist the top of the wire.
Bend one end of the wire into a large circle shape, then fasten the tip of the circle to the straight part of the wire by bending it with pliers.
Wrap mesh or wire netting, like chicken wire, around the circle. Use the pliers to bend it in place.

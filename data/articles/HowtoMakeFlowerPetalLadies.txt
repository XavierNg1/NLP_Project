  Do this by grasping the stem in one hand and the flower part in the other and pulling in opposite directions.  Some can be stubborn, so tug hard.  They will come apart, and small plastic pieces such as stamens will fall out.  Keep these little pieces to use later.
  Look inside and you will see a tiny hole where the flower was once attached.  The two pipe cleaners might be a tight fit, but the chenille will flatten and they will go through the hole.  This makes the skirt, repeat with up to two more blossoms for a fuller skirt.
  Push the skirt to approximately half way on the pipe cleaners and allow the two "body" beads to rest against the skirt.  Thread on a small flower part to act as the collar.,  Thread on another small blossom for a hat.
 Cut 1" off the ends of the arms.  Thread the small plastic flower pieces that fell off when you took the flower apart onto each of the arms as bracelets.,  Separate the two pipe cleaners and bend one down until it touches the head bead to form a loop.  Wrap the other piece tightly around the base of the loop to secure it.  Thread a 12" piece of curling ribbon through the loop and tie for a hanger.
  Bend back the ends and twist to form feet.  Bend the feet upward.,  She will make you smile.  Draw on a face with fine line Sharpie.  Her perky little skirt will never need pressing.

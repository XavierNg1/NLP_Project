 If your doctor finds your thyroid to be functioning normally, and your goiter isn't big enough to cause health problems, she might recommend simply watching and waiting. Medical intervention can cause side effects, and if there's no problem other than a small amount of irritation you should wait and see if the problem clears up with time. Down the road, if the goiter increases in size or begins to cause problems, you can make other decisions.
 Sometimes, goiters can be caused by problems in your diet. Iodine deficiencies have been linked to goiters, so getting more iodine in your diet can reduce their size.Everyone needs at least 150 micrograms of iodine a day.Shrimp and other shellfish are high in iodine, as are sea vegetables such as kelp, hiziki, and kombu.Organic yogurt and raw cheese are high in iodine. One cup of yogurt contains 90 micrograms, and an ounce of raw cheddar contains 10 to 15 micrograms.Cranberries are extremely high in iodine. There are 400 micrograms in 4 ounces of cranberries. Strawberries are another great berry choice. One cup has 13 micrograms.
Navy beans and potatoes also contain high amounts of iodine.Make sure you get iodized salt.

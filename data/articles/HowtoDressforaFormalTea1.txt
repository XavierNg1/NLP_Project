The skirt should be no shorter than knee-length, and you should avoid dresses that show too much cleavage or expose too much of your back.
Avoid bold, loud patterns. A dress with a delicate floral pattern works well, but other simple patterns and plain colors are also suitable.
Not all sundresses are appropriate for a formal tea. If you would wear it to the beach or to a barbecue, it is likely too informal for this type of event. When in doubt, pick the more tailored dress that has a zipper closure to the one with an elastic band around the waste and wrinkled straps that tie at the shoulders.;

The heels do not have to be high, nor do they have to be closed at the back, but flats are not formal enough.
Dressy, heeled sandals work for an informal tea, but not for a formal tea.
Avoid flip-flops at all costs, and no sports shoes whatsoever.
 Hats are nearly a necessity for formal tea.


A wide-brimmed straw picture hat is a safe option that looks nice on most women.
Other Victorian or vintage style hats may also work, depending on the rest of your outfit.
 Necklaces, bracelets, and earrings made of pearls or faux pearls work best. Minimize that amount of sparkly jewelry you wear.



Keep them at the wrist; long gloves should be avoided.
Crochet and net gloves work best, but satin gloves also work well.
 Choose white, off-white, or other light colors.

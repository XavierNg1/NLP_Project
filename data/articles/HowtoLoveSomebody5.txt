 You'll find it harder to be truthful in relationships where you're not acting like your true self. Don't hide who you are. Instead, learn that others should accept you for who you are. Set achievable goals for yourself. These should build on your characteristics, not turn you into someone you're not.


For example, if you're a quiet person with a small group of close friends, don't challenge yourself to become the most popular person at school. Chances are, this wouldn't make you happy and you'd be doing it for the wrong reasons.
 You'll be able to foster loving relationships if you act in a loving, compassionate manner. This means being trustworthy, respectful, and kind. While this may sound simple, you'll need to keep evaluating how loving you are.Showing loving traits takes practice. Don't give up, but continue to improve your loving qualities. Your relationships will benefit from your efforts.
 This doesn't just mean being talkative. Instead, you should try to be skilled at honest, open communication. This includes actively listening to the other person. Learn to ask questions and be specific when talking.The other person will feel more engaged.


Remember to be personal. Think about how what you're saying will be received by the other person. Try to make a personal connection.
 Never intimidate, blame, emotional abuse, threaten, isolate, or talk down to another person.This controlling behavior is really just a way for one person to gain power over the other. When this happens, a healthy, loving relationship is not possible.


Relationship abuse gradually worsens over time. If you think you are in an abusive relationship, seek outside help. Remember, you deserve to be in a healthy, loving relationship.

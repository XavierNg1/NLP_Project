 There are many types of peppers available on the market, and you can choose which kind to grow depending on the size, color, and level of spice your desire.

Bell peppers, also called sweet peppers, are the most mild of all the pepper varieties. They come in shades of red, orange, yellow, and green and tend to be about the size of a fist. Grow these to eat raw or add to many dishes.
Hot peppers come in many different varieties. The most mild of all the hot peppers is the anaheim pepper, but other popular varieties include the jalapeno and the serrano pepper.;
, Choose an area in your yard with full sunlight and good drainage.

You will grow the largest peppers in full sunlight, but they can grow in a bed that has a little shade. Avoid planting peppers in an area in complete shade.
If your soil is very rocky or tends to flood in the rain, consider building a raised bed for your peppers.
 Peppers grow best in a soil with a pH between 6.2 and 7.0. Err on the high side of the pH scale, however, as peppers can withstand slightly alkaline conditions.


If your soil is too acidic, add limestone or wood ash to neutralize the pH.
If your soil is too alkaline, add pine needles or peat moss to neutralize the pH.
 Mix fertilizer into your soil and remove any rocks and separate any large chunks in the dirt.


Fertilizers include fishmeal, chicken manure, or a pre-mixed fertilizer available for purchase at a local gardening center.
Hand pick any weeds that may be present to prevent them from overrunning your pepper patch.

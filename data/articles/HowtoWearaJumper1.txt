 When choosing a jumper, body type should be considered. Jumpers can be flattering on most frames, so make sure you choose a cut that brings out your best side.With a smaller bust, you may want to divert your eyes elsewhere. You may to get a neckline that has beads or jewels embroidered onto it. You can also try a looser cut to add volume. If you have a bigger bust, a v-line can be flattering.
You should also think about your general frame. A free form, loose jumper works great if you have a curvy figure. If your figure is more flat, go for a layer jumper or a jumper with a tie or belt at the waist. This can add volume.;
, Jumpers tend to work best on taller women. If you're taller, most jumpers will work. A wide legged jumper with a halter top can be particularly flattering on a taller figure. Patterns may also be overwhelming if you have a taller frame, so solid colors work best. If you're shorter, try experimenting with a variety of fun patterns. You can also go for a tapered leg, as a wider leg can swallow up a shorter frame., As jumpers usually draw attention to your midsection, you'll want to think about torso length. Whether your torso is long or short makes a difference in your jumper options.If you have a short torso, a wide leg can draw the eyes downward. You should also think about think about a drop waist, which is where the seam of the jumper is positioned near the hips rather than the waist.
For a longer torso, patterns or prints can help hide your waist. You may want to look at a jumper that comes with a drawstring at the waist. A drawstring can be tied loosely, causing the jumper to sag. This can lessen the appearance of your waist.
 Jumpers do have a tendency to be well-suited for people who are taller. Long garments can actually make the body look shorter and squatter. If you're short, you can combat this with proper footwear. Consider shoes with high heels or wedges. This can lift you up slightly, making you look tall despite the jumper.

,,, Press G to raise the landing gear and keep the glider level behind and slightly above the tow plane until it begins to climb.
 This will keep you out of the tow plane's wake turbulence and will make it easier for the tow plane to fly straight by overcoming the propeller's p-factor force. Control vertical position with the stick, and the position behind the tow plane with the rudder.
 The tow plane should turn left. This is standard tow release procedure in the United States.
 Thermals (hot air rising upward) are likelier to be over these areas and will help your glider stay aloft. If you are flying over vegetation, you will find the thermals over brown areas. Green areas absorb heat.
 This is the variometer instrument. It tells you when you are climbing or descending. If the sound is high pitch, the glider is rising in a thermal. If the pitch of the sound is low, you're losing altitude. Go into a shallow dive and look for places with puffy clouds above you, or fly above buildings, houses or any other structures, until the pitch goes up and you start climbing. Fly tight circles to stay inside the thermal and climb until it runs out, then repeat as necessary to stay aloft.
 When you are ready to land, press G to lower the landing gear, point the nose down, pick a landing spot, open and close the speed brakes as necessary to keep your airspeed as close as possible to 50 to 55 knots, and land the glider.

 In a small bowl, mix 1 teaspoon (7 g) of honey and 1 teaspoon (4.5 g) of coconut oil. Use a spoon to carefully blend the two together so they’re fully incorporated.If you don’t have coconut oil, you can substitute olive or jojoba oil.
 When the honey and coconut oil are mixed, sprinkle in 1 teaspoon (4 g) of brown sugar. Stir the mixture until the sugar is fully incorporated, and the scrub has a thick, smooth texture.If you want the scrub to have additional flavor, you can mix in a few drops of vanilla or almond extract.
If the texture of the scrub is too thin, mix in more brown sugar a little at a time.
If the texture of the scrub is too thick, mix in more honey a little at a time.
 When the scrub is mixed to the right consistency, use the spoon to place it in a small container that has a lid. Store the scrub in the refrigerator to keep it fresh.To use the scrub, rub a small amount over your lips for at least 30 seconds. There’s no need to wipe or rinse it off. It’s completely edible so you can just lick it off.

 Anorexia, loss of appetite, and weight loss are all symptoms of polyoma virus in birds, so keep track of your conure's eating habits. For an accurate assessment, check your pet's food bowl everyday when you change it, and note how much food has spilled out onto the bottom of the cage. Regurgitation and vomiting are also signs of the disease, so check the cage liner each day when changing it to see if your bird is digesting its food properly., Observe your conure's movement and activity for signs of the polyoma virus. Listlessness and paralysis are both symptoms of the illness, which require careful observation to identify. Conures are generally very playful and active birds, so it should be easy to note if your pet is moving less than usual.Difficulty breathing is another symptom of polynoma that might restrict your conure's mobility.
 Check the liner of your bird's cage for signs of excessive urination or diarrhea. The liner will appear more wet or soiled than usual if this is the case. Both these symptoms can be attributed to polyoma virus, but are cause for concern either way and are reason to contact your veterinarian., Observe your bird everyday for physical signs of polynoma. Note that once the disease has manifested itself visibly, it has already progressed extensively and your pet is in danger. Contact your veterinarian or an emergency veterinaryÂ  clinic immediately if you see:A distended abdomen
Bleeding (hemorrhages) below the skin
Feather abnormalities (e.g., lacing or flying feathers)

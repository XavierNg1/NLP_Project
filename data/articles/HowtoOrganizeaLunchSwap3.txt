 Smaller lunch swap groups might require each person to pitch in with cleanup, but for larger groups, most of the cleanup can probably be handled by three to five people. Rotating between swappers for cleanup duty will fairly distribute the work among everyone.


As a perk for those cleaning up, you might allow members on the cleanup crew to take leftovers home in plastic containers.
 Paper products, utensils, sauces, and similar items often become garbage when used. These should be thrown away in the garbage when your meal is done. Separate recyclable material and put in proper receptacle. Uneaten food can be stored and taken home in plastic-ware.
 Bits of food left on your desk or lunch table can become home to bacteria and attract bugs, like ants and cockroaches. Take a mild cleaning agent and spray the table with it. Then use a clean rag or paper towel to wipe the table clean.Crumbs and other dirt will collect under your rag as you wipe. Push this buildup off the edge of the table and into a free hand, then dump the crumbs in the trash.
 Creating a mess is a surefire way of getting lunch swapping banned in your office. Most of the cleanup at this point should already done, but it's easy to overlook a full garbage can. If you've filled up the garbage over the course of your meal, take it out when you're finished.


Additionally, if you've thrown food away in the garbage, it can attract bugs or rot and give off a bad smell. Taking out the garbage after eating will prevent this.

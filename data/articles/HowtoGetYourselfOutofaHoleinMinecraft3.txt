 You need a spade and/or a pickaxe as well, for quick digging. You can do it without, but prepare for a long, hard, risky slog up to the surface.
 Tap on a place as far up as you can reach until the water flows down.
 Then, with your spade or pickaxe, make a small two block crevice in the nearestÂ wall and go into it. Get the water back into the bucket again.
 Then repeat step three until you emerge at the surface.

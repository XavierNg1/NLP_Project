 For non-members, use a tiger for an adult, and a bunny for a kitten. For members, use a snow leopard, cheetah, or fox for an adult.;
, Don't wear anything like top hats or anything cats would never wear. Leaf armor does good, and so do most necklaces. Tail armor works too.
 Don't use anything like pink, yellow, or green for the fur. Use colors like brown, orange, black, white, and grey. You can use the secret color blue because it is almost white. For the eyes, use yellow, green, dark purple, light blue, and dark blue.
 Patterns are a big thing with cats. If you are a tabby, use fire and lightning to look realistic. For calicoes, use pretty much any other pattern.
 Find a free space to sleep or sit at. Say " Is - cat or kitten -. Adopt me."


Don't say things like this "Adopt me or I'll be no longer alive! I need a - owner or mom - or else I will be dead!" or things like this " I need a -mommy or owner- or I will be dead soon!". Those are annoying to hear.
, Meow when you want to talk normally, purr when you are happy, hiss when you are threatened, growl (catlike growl) when you are mad, and yowl when hurt. Those are what cats do.
 Be nice to your owner(s). If there are kids, don't scratch or bite them unless they are torturing you. Also, don't wreck the furniture. That can get you sent back to the pillow room. Or worse, reported, blocked, and if AJHQ finally gives a muffin, banned.
 Don't just say this: " Hey can we get another pet cat I really want a friend to play with!" because that would make you look like a human. Do it like this: "- meows - Can I have a friend, owner?". That is how you won't look like a human.

Shield gun, Primary; charges a melee attack that deals 150 damage. If you manage to get to him.Â ;) Secondary; A shield that slowly degenerates over time. It doesn't protect your legs.Useless against rockets, mini-gun, flak and shock combo's. Close range, not advised.






S.M.G., Primary, very weak and inaccurate automatic fire. Do not use this. Secondary, Grenades deal a steady 70 damage. Charge them full and use them as ghetto rockets.






Bio-rifle, primary; Little green blobs doing 40 damage when they hit. On the ground they act like mines exploding after 5 seconds. Secondary, Charge up a big blob doing a whopping 250 damage in the case of a direct hit. Hard to aim. Medium close range.






Shock-rifle, arguably the most useful weapon. Primary; a hit-scan doing 40 damage. Secondary; a slow moving bolt doing 45 damage. Combo; Shoot the secondary with the primary shot and BOOM. Long to medium range.






Mini-gun, Primary, powerful machine gun, inaccurate. Secondary, extremely accurate machine gun, at expense of damage. Close to medium range.






Link-gun, Highest DPS weapon, although easily dodged. Primary shoots green bolts. Extremely useful in close combat. Secondary is a constant stream doing 50 damage per sec. Close range.






Rocket launcher. Primary shoots a single rocket, medium range. Secondary charges a 2 to 3 rocket barrage. By keeping the right button pressed and clicking left, you can shoot a 3 rocket spiral. Medium close range.






Flak cannon, Primary, shoots out hot chunks of metal, in a shotgun like fashion. Useful in close combat. Secondary is a grenade/mortar, direct hit does 90-160 damage. Close to medium range.






LG, A sniper with a beacon so everyone knows where you are. Direct hit deals 70 damage, head shot makes for 140. Secondary is the zoom. Long medium range.

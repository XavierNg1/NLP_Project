 In order to stream content from your iPad to your TV, your TV needs to have network-capabilities, and needs to be connected to your home network.


The process for connecting your TV to your network varies from TV to TV. Consult your TV's documentation or support page for instructions on connecting the TV to your home network.
 In order to send data to the TV, you will need an app that allows you to connect to Smart TVs on your network. One of the most popular apps is iMediaShare.


The free version will allow you to stream pictures and videos that are on your iPad already. In order to use the additional streaming options you will need the paid version.
 After a moment, the content on your iPad will load. You will be able to select any image or video stored on your iPad.
 Selecting a video will pull up a menu of all the connected devices on your network. Choose your Smart TV from the list. If your TV is not listed, tap the "Others (Undetected)" option and follow the prompts to try to detect your TV.
 After selecting your TV from the list of options, the video will begin playing on the TV screen. You can control playback from the app on the iPad.If you are experiencing poor performance, it may be because your TV is connected wirelessly. Try connecting your Smart TV via Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi, or place your iPad closer to your router.

 Grease the inside of a 7 by 11-inch (17.78 by 27.94 -centimeter) casserole dish with cooking spray, oil, or butter, then set it aside., Use a shape that is able to hold lots of sauce, such as bow ties, shells, or elbows. Don't use spaghetti noodles. Most types of pasta will be ready in about 8 minutes., Heat a little oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil gets hot, add the beef and onion. Cook them until the beef is no longer pink inside, stirring occasionally. Drain the excess fat away.

Save time by cooking the beef and onion at the same time as the pasta.
 Stir everything together with a wooden spoon to combine. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the skillet often to ensure that everything mixes in evenly., By now, the pasta should be finished cooking. If you have not yet already, drain the pasta. Shake it to get rid of any excess water, then stir it into the beef mixture., Use a rubber spatula or a wooden spoon to help the mixture get into the corners of the baking dish. Cover the dish with aluminum foil., After 20 minutes, take it out of the oven, uncover it, and sprinkle the crushed tortilla chips on top. Cover the casserole back up, and bake it for 10 minutes more. It's ready when it's heated through., You can serve it as is, or you can garnish it further with a sprinkle of cilantro. Anything that you'd put in a taco or on a plate of nachos is a good bet. Sour cream, cilantro, or sliced black olives would work especially well here.

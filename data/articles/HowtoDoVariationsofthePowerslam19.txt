, The wrestler tucks his head under the opponent's near arm, and reaches across the opponent's chest and around their neck with his near arm.



Tamon Honda uses a variation where he locks the opponent into an Arm triangle choke, and then slams the opponent with the ura-nage. He calls this variation the Rolling Olympic Hell.
Hayabusa used a variation where he did not fall backwards, but instead brought the opponent over his head while standing and turning 180Â°, and then fell forward, slamming the opponent down, similar to a side slam. He called this variation the H Edge.
The name ura-nage (or uranage) is incorrectly but commonly used to refer to a regular side slam and though the name in fact comes from a Judo throw, that throw resembles a Saito suplex more than the professional wrestling ura-nage.

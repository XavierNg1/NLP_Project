 Most are on reservations or in fenced-in areas. If you see a potentially dangerous animal, then it's most likely that you're the one who's in the wrong place.;
, Wear things similar to your background (practical colors such as tan or pale green). Don't wear any obscure colors or accessories. Try not to make any large movements.


Don't make unnecessary noises. Noises can attract dangerous animals.
Don't wear anything that smells different. It's best to not shower for a couple of days so that you don't smell like shampoo.
 Have lots of water and food that doesn't spoil quickly. Bring a first-aid kit, compass, map, matches, Swiss army knife, flashlight, sewing kit, and whatever else you think you'll need. This mostly depends on how long you plan to stay.
,, Africa has a variety of dangerous, poisonous things.
 Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be pretty dangerous. If you see one, don't run. Either slowly back away or stay where you are. Don't look the predator directly in the eyes; they will take that as a challenge and most likely attack.
, Being inside a car doesn't automatically mean that you're safe, nor does it mean that you can run over animals or disturb their territory.
 There's probably no way of avoiding this, but it doesn't hurt to try.

 People who have a positive outlook tend to be happier in general and they also have better social lives.If you are always complaining and being pessimistic, people will not want to spend much time with you. Instead, try to be positive and optimistic so that people will feel happier when they are with you. Focus on good things to discuss and steer clear of negative or depressing subjects.
 People who are easy to please are easier to love. Having a laid back attitude and being willing to go with the flow opens up possibilities for the people you spend time with. For example, if you are flexible and easygoing, you will be more willing to try a new restaurant or try a new activity. Try to adopt an open, laid back attitude to make people love spending time with you.Try asking what your friends want to do sometime and do whatever they want for the day.
 Demonstrating to others that you are a caring person will make them love you even more. Talk about your passions, be considerate of your friendsâ€™ needs and feelings, and be kind to strangers. The more that people see you as a caring person, the more they will want to spend time with you and grow to love you.Always ask your friends how they are doing and show genuine interest in their response. Offer your support if they are having a bad day or in need of encouragement.
 To make people love you, it is important to help when people need you. But sometimes we help others with the expectations that they will return the favor sometime. Demonstrate your willingness to help without expecting a return favor. Let them know that you are just happy that you can help and that you are there for them any time. Showing that you are selfless will make it even easier for people to love you.

 Staying hydrated can keep your skin firm and reduce the appearance of cellulite. Drink as much water as you can during the day and opt for water-rich foods such as watermelon, cucumber, carrots, lettuce, zucchini, and watercress., Collagen is the main structural protein found in skin, and its production is necessary for firm, youthful, smooth skin. To tighten skin (and your butt), eat foods that prevent the breakdown of collagen and stimulate its growth in the body. Some of these foods include:Sunflower seeds
Chilis
Blueberries
Oily fish, such as trout
Olive oil
Dark chocolate

, Excessive salt can cause the body to retain water, which can make cellulite appear worse. Stay away from processed foods, which are generally high in sodium, and be vigilant about reading nutrition information on product packaging. Note that products like soda, snack cakes, and deli meats are all deceptively high in salt.

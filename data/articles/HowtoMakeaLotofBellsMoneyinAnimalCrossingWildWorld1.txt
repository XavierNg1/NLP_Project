 (Each sells for 500 Bells.)
, Some will drop 100 Bell bags (and two will contain furniture that can be sold).

Some trees might contain bees, so be careful. If you see any bees, run into a nearby building or else they will sting your eye. (And your animal friends will talk about it a lot.) Or, catch them to sell for 4,500 Bells each.
, See methods below for more details., Talk to them if they run up to you (sometimes they will give you furniture to sell)., Leave invested for 10% interest every month., Get them checked by Blathers first and you can sell them, if they are not already at the museum. To double your money, sell them at the flea market.,, Every day there is a rock to bang and money comes out. Try another rock until one of the rocks makes a sound and Bells pop out (This will happen to only one random rock each day.) The amount may vary. To do this, simply dig a few holes behind your character since when you hit the rock your character will bounce back causing less bells to come out of the rock. Continuously hit the rock until it makes a little twinkle sound. To get the maximum of Bells, try to dig as few holes as possible behind your character and use a silver shovel when hitting the money rock.

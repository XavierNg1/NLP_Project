 Because dog motion sickness is often closely related to nervousness, it can be helpful to ensure your dog feels safe and secure while in your car. Additionally, reducing motion will help dogs who experience sickness due to the movement of the car.


It is often best to keep your dog in a limited area in your back seat.
You can purchase a special canine seat belt for your car, which will face your dog forward during travel and reduce motion sickness., Keeping your car cool with fresh air can be very helpful. A breeze is usually beneficial even if it’s warm outside. Keep the window cracked to improve air flow. If you notice your dog panting or drooling, you may need to further reduce the temperature as these are typically indicators that the dog is too warm., To quell nervousness and anxiety, keep your dog occupied by engaging them in an interesting task. Bring along a favorite treat or toy, or choose one toy that the dog only gets to play with in the car. Bring a chew toy that will take the dog several hours to consume. Ask a friend or family member to help you distract the dog so you can drive safely., Traveling on an empty stomach will reduce nausea. Allow your dog to fast for at least an hour prior to travel. Continue to give your dog access to plenty of water while they’re fasting., This gives your dog a chance to rest, and it is also a great opportunity for your pet to get some outdoor time, exercise, and relieve themselves. These travel breaks allow the dog to recover from nausea, and relax prior to continuing the trip.

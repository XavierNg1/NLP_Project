 Consider a shout or distraction if no flashbangs were available. You will immediately turn right. Even if there's someone in front of you, leave him. Sweep from right to left after moving against the nearest wall and shoot any enemy you see. Your second man will enter at the same time you do and does the same thing you did with the left. Make sure you and the second man get on walls so 3 and 4 have clear shots to the middle left and right, respectively. Once the threats are taken care of, each teammate should guard an entry (or corner) while you yell, "Status". Each teammate will report on who they shot and where they were. Once you are satisfied, call "stack up" and line up for the next room.;

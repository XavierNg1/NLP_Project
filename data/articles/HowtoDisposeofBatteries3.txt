 Many types of batteries contain hazardous materials, such as mercury, lead, or acid. While you are waiting to dispose of your batteries, keep them in a place where they will not be accessible to children or pets who might be harmed by playing with them or swallowing them.If you do suspect that a child or pet has swallowed a battery, contact emergency services immediately.
 If your batteries become corroded or overheated, they could leak or rupture. It is also important to avoid storing your batteries near any flammable materials, as this could present a fire hazard., Sometimes seemingly dead batteries still carry a bit of a charge. If the positive and negative terminals of old batteries touch, it can create an electric current, which can lead to a fire. This risk can be minimized by putting a little tape over the terminals of your old batteries until you are ready to dispose of them.Fire can also result from the terminals of batteries coming into contact with conductive materials (like keys, steel wool, or other objects likely to be lying in your rummage drawer).
 Storing your batteries in a non-conductive container will reduce the risk of fire, leakage, or rupture.If you still have the original packaging for your batteries, this is a relatively safe way to store old batteries for disposal.
Consider individually bagging especially hazardous batteries, like 9 volt alkaline batteries, button batteries, lead acid batteries, or lithium batteries.
 Mixing batteries with different chemistries may result in leakage and hazardous chemical reactions. If you have multiple types of batteries to dispose of, bag them separately.

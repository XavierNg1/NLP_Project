 If you tried all these methods, and your host’s dog still will not leave you alone, it is ok to ask them to put the dog up. Your host should understand. Especially if you have allergies, are fearful of dogs, or just don’t care for dogs, your host should be willing to accommodate you.


You can say, for example, “Thank you for inviting me into your home. This isn’t a huge issue, but your dog keeps following me around. I have tried to ignore it, but I am slightly allergic to dogs. Do you mind putting it up or outside?”

, When asking your host to put their dog away, remember to be polite. Using "could" instead of "can" will make a request sound more polite. Therefore, your host will be more likely to agree to your request. There are also other phrases that you can use that are less direct and more polite.You can say, "I was wondering if you could put your dog in another room or outside because I am a bit allergic to dogs."
Or, "Do you think you might be able to put your dog outside? I am a little allergic to dogs."

, Explain to your host that it isn't the dog that is bothering you, but the dog's behavior. In other words, try to separate the behavior from the dog as much as possible. On the other hand, if you are allergic to dogs or are fearful of dogs, make it clear that the dog isn't the problem, but that you are the problem. This way, you can avoid offending your host.


For example, you can say, "Can I ask you something? I have never been good with dogs. I developed a fear of dogs when I was young, and I am still trying to get over it. Could you put your dog up or outside?"
You could also say, "Your dog is very sweet, but I don't like the way it jumps up on me when it greets me. What can I do to prevent it from jumping on me?"

 Make sure you trust him/her, and tell him/her the situation so that he or she knows how to care for the child if an emergency happens.
 If so, bring the doctor to your den.
 However, watch the doctor perform his/her procedure from another room to make sure your child isn't getting hurt.

If you see something you don't like, escort the doctor out of your house and get him/her fired. Seek help from another doctor afterwards.

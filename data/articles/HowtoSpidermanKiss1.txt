 To hang upside down, you need a firm and reliable surface that can hold your weight. Ideally, pick something designed to hold the full weight of a human. A couch or a bed would work well, while tables may topple depending on their strength.


In addition to finding the right surface, put some padding down underneath to protect you if you fall.;
, Seated on the firm surface, bend your head over the edge. For safety, it's best to keep the rest of your body on the surface.


On a couch, for example, you could sit upside down. Place your feet and legs over the back of the couch and have your back and arms on the seat. Then, tilt your head over the edge.
On a table, lie flat on the table on your back. Then, tilt your head over the edge.
 Unless you do activities like this frequently, you may not be able to bend your head back very far. If you feel pain, stop. Pushing your body into an uncomfortable position can cause strain., Once you're hanging backwards, you can do the spiderman kiss. Have your partner come up and kiss you on the lips as you're hanging upside down. Keep in mind, as it's difficult to hang from a very high surface, your partner may have to kneel down to reach your lips.

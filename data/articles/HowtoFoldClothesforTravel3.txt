 Your heaviest and biggest shoes are the ones that are going to cause the most problems. Either leave them at home (unless you're going somewhere really cold or wet) or wear them while you're traveling.
 A shoe bag can keep shoes away from your clothes so that they don't dirty your clothes up. If you put the shoes in the bottom of your case, then they'll be more likely to stay secure and to not be as irritating.
 Do not waste the space inside of your shoes. Fill them with socks, or place your fragile items in there. A lot of people forget that the insides of their shoes are just wasted space.









You can also bring shoes that you're not that fond of, or that are on their last legs. Then you can leave them behind when you're packing to return home.
 This doesn't work as well if you have to check them for a flight, but it's a great space saver if you're going with a carry-on or taking some other mode of transportation.









try to tie them so that they don't hit you constantly, or hit other people.

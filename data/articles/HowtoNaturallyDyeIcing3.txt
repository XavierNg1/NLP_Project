 For a more concentrated dye, you can simmer the liquid dye uncovered on low heat for 24 hours until the liquid is ¼ its original volume. You may want to use a crockpot or slow cooker for this.Keep an eye on the juice as it simmers to make sure that too much liquid does not boil out.
While you can add unconcentrated juice to icing to color it, the color may be very light. If you add too much juice, you might make the icing watery.
 If you don’t want to make your own concentrated food dyes, there are many brands that offer natural food dyes without artificial coloring. Some health food or natural food stores may carry them; you might also look online to see if you can have them shipped to you.Some brands of natural food dye include:


India Tree
Trucolor
Color Garden

, Dump the icing into a mixing bowl, and add just a few drops of the concentrated dye to the icing. Use a whisk, fork, or hand mixer to blend the color with the icing. If the color is too light, add another drop of two until the icing reaches the desired color.You can also mix different colors of concentrated food dyes to produce different shades or hues.

 Properly storing your makeup sponge will prolong the beauty toolâ€™s life. It will also prevent breakout causing bacteria from growing inside your sponge.


Store your sponge in a cool, well-ventilated, and well-lit space. Do not keep your sponge inside a draw, medicine cabinet, or sealed cosmetic bag.
Keep your sponge on your bathroom counter in a clean soap dish. This storage method will expose your sponge to fresh air and bacteria-killing light.
When you travel, keep your sponge in a separate mesh makeup bag. Do not throw your absorbent and soft beauty tool into a bag full of makeup, germs, and sharp corners., Reusable makeup sponges are made out of a microbial resistant foam. While these high quality tools are designed to be reused, they can collect bacteria and deteriorate if not cared for properly and replaced frequently.


Wash your reusable sponge at least once a week. If you are prone to breakouts, wash your sponge after every use.
Replace your eco-friendly sponge every 3 to 4 months., Basic foam makeup sponges are not intended for multiple uses. These products harbor bacteria that could cause infections and/or breakouts. After using a foam sponge, throw the product away. Do not attempt to clean these sponges.


If you are looking for a reusable sponge, purchase a microbial resistant foam sponge, or blender.

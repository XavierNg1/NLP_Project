 What will the name of your comic be?;
, If you decide to be a Pokémon don't miss out this step (you can if you like though)! There could be something different to make you stand out,E.G if you choose to be an Absol, make the blade go down like a tuft of hair.
 Will you travel around the region/s? Or do you have an adventure at home? You choose! Will the elite four come and challenge you ? Will you venture around and beat the gyms? Is a relative in the Elite Four? Do you join a guild? Do you have a rescue team base? Do you stay in the tall grass or caves? There's allot to think about.
 What happened in your past? Did you live in the forest? Did you travel before? Did you sit at home researching Pokémon to become a master? Did you not care ? Did you have a Pokémon already? Were you a human? Did you live with humans? Were you trapped? Were you evil ? Are you evil?

, What's your ambition? Do you travel to become a master? Do you just simply want an adventure? Do you want to meet every Pokémon? Do you want to catch 'em all? Do you want to form a guild?

, What's the plot? Are you on a quest to save the Pokémon from extinction? Does your rival try to stop you from your goal? Do the gym leaders decline your challenges so you move straight on to the Elite Four? Is there a rival guild taking all the spotlight and is evil?

, Do all the events lead up to a success? Do you fail? Do you leave it up to the readers to imagine the ending?

, If so remember that they happen later!

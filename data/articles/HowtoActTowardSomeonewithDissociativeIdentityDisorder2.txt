 Shame and stigma often lead people with mental disorders to feel very isolated. Help the person maintain a healthy relationship by actively engaging with him or her. You don't need to discuss DID. In fact, it may be better to spend time together not discussing the disorder. This may help him or her to feel "normal."

Find an activity you can do together to focus your discussion on something other than DID.
 Support groups are great ways to find others who share similar experiences.Suggest you start attending a support group together to show support.

If you can't find a support group in your area, consider joining an online support group.

 A dog in mourning may need extra love and attention. Try to increase the amount of time you spend with the dog. You might spend twenty extra minutes in the morning and evening to help give the dog support while they are grieving the death of their owner.During this time, you can:


Talk to the dog
Walk the dog






Groom the dog






Go on a car ride
Visit the dog park
Pick out a new toy together at the pet store;
, Touch increases the bond between dogs and people. Extra cuddling, petting, and brushing can improve the dog’s mood and distract them from the loss of their owner. As you spend time with the dog, rub their belly or scratch their ears. Give them a little extra grooming time each week. This will help you bond and comfort the dog.
 Playtime can distract the dog from the loss of their owner. The extra exercise can also boost their mood and decrease the likelihood of grief-related health issues. Try to identify the dog’s favorite games or toys, and spend extra time playing with them.Some older dogs may not want to play as much. Each dog is different. If the dog is uninterested in playing, you might try another way of distracting them.
You can also give the dog new and interesting toys. Food puzzle toys can help keep the dog busy while you are not home, reducing the dog’s separation anxiety., The dog may appreciate having people over to spend time with. Invite a few friends over, and see how the dog reacts. If the dog enjoys the company and socializes with the people, you may want to keep it up. If the dog avoids your guests, you should respect their space.Inviting people or dogs that the dog already knows may cheer the dog up. It can also introduce an element of familiarity in their new life.
If the people are total strangers to the dog, invite one or two over at a time to see how well the dog handles it.

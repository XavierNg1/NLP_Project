 It is very common for cigars to tobacco to be infused with fruit flavors, like cherry, apricot, and blackcurrant. Alcoholic drinks are also popular for tobacco infusion, especially:


Rum
Whiskey
Wine, Liqueurs are generally strong flavored alcohols with a pungent scent. Common liqueurs include flavors like amaretto, coffee, chocolate, berry flavors, hazelnut, melon, and anisette (licorice flavor).


Creamy or sugary liqueurs can create stickiness in your tobacco and should probably be avoided or used extremely sparingly., Popular essential oils used in tobacco flavoring include citrus flavors, like lemon and orange, flower scents, like lavender and rose, and more. You should always look up the usage information of an essential oil before using it in your infusions. Some essential oils are not safe to ingest or smoke.


Essential oils are very potent and should be used very sparingly for your tobacco infusions. In most cases, a few drops on a flavoring pad or diluted in water or a carrier liquid (for pipe tobacco) will be enough., Coffee is a popular flavor that is used in everything from liquor to candy, and coffee might add a pleasing flavor to your tobacco.You may be able to store fresh ground coffee tied off in a filter with tobacco/cigars to impart this flavor to it.


When infusing cigars, you should probably keep the cigar from touching the grounds directly. Cigars are very absorbent, and an overpowering infusion could ruin the cigar.

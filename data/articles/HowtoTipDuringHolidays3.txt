 The holidays are expensive for everyone, and an early tip can really help some people get through the season. It is good to tip early in December. At this time, it does not seem as though the tip is an afterthought, and the recipient can use the tip towards holiday gifts, travel, or food.Generally, the latest you should give a tip is right before Christmas.That said, the recipient might appreciate a New Year’s tip instead.
 A tip is a way of showing your gratitude, and you should make sure that the recipient knows just how grateful you are for their service. Write a note to accompany the tip. You can write it in a card, holiday-themed stationary, or just on a piece of paper. Express your gratitude for their service while wishing them happy holidays.


For example, you might write, “Dear Louise, Thank you so much for your services this year. We don’t know what we would do without you. I wish you happy holidays with your family this year. Thank you again.”
It is best to stick with a generic “Happy Holidays” unless you are certain which specific holidays the recipient might celebrate.
Once you have written the note, put it in an envelope with the tip tucked inside., You should hand the tip over at the end of a typical session. If you pay them at the end of a week, it may be nice to accompany their paycheck with the card. If possible, hand them the envelope in person.


As you hand them the card, you can say, “This is just to say thank you for everything you’ve done this year.”

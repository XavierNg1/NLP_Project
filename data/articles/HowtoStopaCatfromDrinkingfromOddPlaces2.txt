 Your cat might be turning on faucets or drinking from the toilet as a source of entertainment. You can distract your cat from these activities by making sure they are stimulated through interactive play every day. Try playing games with a laser, wand toy, or bubbles. You can also engage your cat with balls and feather toys they can chase., Another way you can enrich your catâ€™s environment and provide stimulation is with a puzzle feeder. A puzzle feeder is a toy that you place food inside of. The cat is rewarded with a treat when it solves the puzzle. This can distract your cat from playing in the toilet or turning on faucets., Consider setting up a cat tree in your home. By creating more vertical space for your cat, you will give them opportunities to play and climb in the new space. You can try a simple cat tree, catwalk, or shelving that you install yourself. You can also purchase more elaborate spaces for your cat, like a floor to ceiling cat tree.

 Groups and co-ops for homeschooled kids and their parents get together for academic, arts and crafts, community service activities, field trips, and even shared classes. You’ll meet other kids who understand what you experience through homeschooling. You can make friends based on this and also on how much you enjoy doing activities together.Some groups of homeschooled kids plan social activities, like dances, that kids in traditional schools have. This is a great way to socialize.;
, You can find youth groups through your place of worship. There are also youth groups for kids who have specific social interests. These are groups that focus on helping kids build friendships through different social activities. One of the best things about a youth group is that you’ll already share a lot of values with the other kids.


Find out if your place of worship has a youth group and ask how to join.
You can also find youth groups through community centers.
There are youth groups for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender kids.
Join as a regular member, or you could become a youth leader or advisor as your interest grows.
Most groups have regular meetings, an online presence, retreats, special events, and summer camps.
 Socializing online is a good way to keep in touch with friends you make through other activities and at camp. You can find social networking sites, follow Twitter, post to Instagram, start a blog and follow a few, and even explore online games and virtual worlds. Be sure to get your parents’ permission, and ask what kind of information you are allowed to post.Only post things you are comfortable with other people seeing. When you post something, the whole world can access it and it will never go away.
Talk with your parents or research information about staying safe when you are online.

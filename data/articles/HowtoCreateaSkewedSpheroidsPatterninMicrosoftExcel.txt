, At first, it was thought one might save a lot of time if one had read this article - "Create a Pink Love Note of Spheres in Form of a Heart", because there is a section that was introduced with that article that gets used again here. But, as it turns out, there have been changes in the interim.
 The formulas for A1 and A2 are the same. Adjuster = 1.
Enter -61 for TURNS into cell B2.
The result in cell B5 now shows -81,152 and the formula is "=IF(TURNS>0,VLOOKUP(TURNS,TURNS_LOOKUP,2),VLOOKUP(TURNS, TURNS_LOOKUP_NEG,2))" which is the same I believe.
Enter 26 for S's Count into cell C1. (although 28 will appear.)
The result in cell C2 = 2230 for Designer and the formula has not changed from "=VLOOKUP(S_COUNT,SPHEROIDS_COUNT_LOOKER,2)"
The formula for Var, cell C3, has been overwritten with the value 25.
The formula for Cc is unchanged and the result is -.03141593
db is unchanged at 4.5
GMSL and GMLL are unchanged.
The formula for top is unchanged at "=ROUND((-B4*PI())+(Adj),0)" and the result is 886771.
AAA is unchanged at 1.00244189810508
Enter 27.5 for Divisor into cell E3.
Enter Y into YN in cell E4.
The formula for Factor is unchanged at "=IF(E4="Y",IF(ODD(S_COUNT)=S_COUNT,-S_COUNT*0.01,S_COUNT*0.01),-0.25)" and the result  is +.26
Enter 0 for Power into cell F2.
Cells H1 and J1 are unchanged at .92 and .96 respectively and the formulas for Sync1 and Sync2 are the same.

B7'S formula has not changed from "=IF(EVEN(S_COUNT)=S_COUNT,ROUND((-B4*PI())+(Adj),0),TOP)"
B8:B1447's formulas have not changed from "=((B7+(-TOP*2)/(AdjRows)))*$B$1"
C7's formula has not changed from "=ROUND(-EXP((PI()^2)+(Cc*-(db))),0)+Designer"
Edit Go To cell range D7:D1447 and with D7 active, enter the formula w/o quotes, "=X7/Divisor+COS((ROW()-7)*PI()/180*Factor)" and Edit Fill Down.
Edit Go To cell range E7:E1447 and with E7 active, enter the formula w/o quotes, "=Y7/Divisor+SIN((ROW()-7)*PI()/180*Factor)" and Edit Fill Down.
Cell range F7:F1447's formulae remain the same as "=IF(A7=0,F6,((PI())*((SIN(B7/(C7*2))*GMLL*COS(B7)*GMLL*(COS(B7/(C7*2)))*GMLL)+D7)))"
Cell range G7:G1447's formulae remain the same as "=IF(A7=0,G6,((PI())*((SIN(B7/(C7*2))*GMLL*SIN(B7)*GMLL*(COS(B7/(C7*2)))*GMLL)+E7)))"
Cell range H7:H1447's formulae remain the same as "=F7*GMLL*Sync1"
Cell range I7:I1447's formulae remain the same as "=G7*GMLL*Sync1"
Cell range J7:J1447's formulae remain the same as "=F7*GMSL*Sync2"
Cell range K7:K1447's formulae remain the same as "=G7*GMSL*Sync2"

, The worksheet does not contain a Defined Variable Name of TT either. No need for you to enter it. Probably part of some approach to a problem that was solved in another way., TURNS_LOOKUP is now in cells $M$2:$N$1441. TURNS_LOOKUP_NEG is in cells $O$2:$P$1442 and runs in column O from -1440 to 0 and in column P from -104192 to 412 (an increment of 72). SPHEROIDS_COUNT_LOOKER is in cells $R$2:$S$1441 and increments by 251175.5 from a base value of -6,363,636 in column S, and from 0 to 1 in cells R2:R25 and then increments by 1 to  a value of 1416 in cell R1446 and then 10,000 in cell R1447., Select cell AA7 and input the value 28.6470945405378. In cell W1, enter "Pool Ball Process:" . In cell V2, enter the note "1) Figure out H, K's per Grid Analysis or previous values;", In cell V3, enter the note "2) Figure out if FFF variable changes -- it adjusts rows up-Y a little -- best ball fit;". In cell V4, enter the note "3) Fill down formulas for X, Y and Radius -- R must = .50000!!" and in cell X5 enter the title "POOL BALL X,Y Determinators:" and Format Cell Font Bold. Edit Go To cell range X7:X1446 and with X7 active enter the formula "=(COS(ROW()-7)*PI()/180*FFF)+V7". Edit Go To cell range Y7:Y1446 and with Y7 active enter the formula "=(COS(ROW()-7)*PI()/180*FFF)+W7". Then read the rest of this section and realize there may be changes in the interim which need updating, but that basically you have now the same info., Enter into cell AA7 28.6470945405378 and Insert Name Define name FFF to cell $AA$7. Enter Per Goal Seeking in cell AA8 and select cell range AA7:AA8 and Format Cells Border Black bold Outline. Enter the notes "Be careful of formulas below" in cell range AA10:AA12. Enter H=x center of each into cell AA14 and K=y center of each into cell AA15.

 It's a project I'm working on. 15 balls and a cue ball times 2 makes 2 games simultaneously. Adequate for a pool shark on a holiday break.,,,

 Position the baking rack in the bottom third of the oven., Push a serrated knife through the squash until you've pierced through the flash and reached the hallow; you'll know this by the lack of resistance. Cut the squash in half using a sawing motion. Don't cut through the stem, and don't worry about separating the halves just yet., You can do this by gripping each half, and twisting-pulling them away from each other, or prying them apart with a stiff spatula. At this point, you can also trim the stem away.
 Make sure that you scrape all the seeds and stringy bits from the hallow. Discard the stringy bits. You can discard the seeds as well, or save them for another recipe; roast acorn squash seeds are delicious!

, Make sure that you place them skin-side-down and fleshy-side-up. Fill the pan with ¼-inch (0.64 centimeters) of water to keep it from drying out or burning.
 You will need about ½ tablespoon for each half. Be sure to get the flat part as well as the hallow. You can spread the oil using a brush or your fingers.
 How much you add is entirely up to you. You can use a little more or a little less than what the recipe suggests.
 The squash is done when it is caramelized and toasted around the edges. You can test for doneness by poking the squash with a fork or knife. If you can pierce all the way through the flesh, the squash is done., You can eat it straight out of the skin, or you can scoop the flesh out with a spoon, and place it into a serving bowl.

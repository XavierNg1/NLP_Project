 Pour 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of extra-virgin olive oil into a large saucepan. Turn the heat to medium, then wait for the olive oil to get hot.
 If you have not done so already, chop 1 small onion, and mince 2 cloves of garlic. Add both to the hot oil, and cook them until they become soft. Stir them occasionally with a rubber spatula so that they don't brown.
 If you have not yet done so, rinse the cauliflower, then cup off the stem and leaves. Cut it into florets, then add it to the saucepan along with the chicken stock. If you are vegetarian, or simply don't like chicken, you can use vegetable stock instead.


If you cannot find any liquid chicken stock, you can make own by dissolving a bouillon cube or powder in 4 cups (950 milliliters) of hot water. How much bouillon you use depends on the brand that you are using; each brand requires different ratios of bouillon to water, so be sure to read the package.
 Reduce the heat to low, and let the mixture simmer for about 15 minutes. You are ready for the next step when the cauliflower turns soft and starts to fall apart.
 You can do this using a hand-held immersion blender, or you can do it in two batches in a blender or food processor.


If you are using a blender, be sure to open the lid a crack after blending to release any built-up pressure., If you used a blender or food processor to pur√©e your soup, pour it back into the saucepan first. Next, add the Parmesan cheese, and stir until it melts and everything is smooth.
 Give the soup a taste, then add as much salt and pepper as you'd like. Serve the soup while it is still hot.

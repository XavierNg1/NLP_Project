 Constipation is often the first sign that parents notice when an infant has botulism. Typically the symptoms begin to show about 3 to 30 days after the infant ingests the spores. If your infant has not had a bowel movement in three days, then you should seek medical attention., Another symptom of botulism in infants is lethargy or muscle weakness. When an infant ingests the bacteria it can multiply and germinate creating a toxin that interferes with the interaction between muscles and nerves. This makes it difficult for infants to move. Watch for the following signs of lethargy:Decreased movement.
Weak cry.
Flat facial expression.
Muscle weakness.
 Botulism in infants can also impact your childâ€™s ability to eat and breathe properly. For example, you may notice weak sucking while your child feeds, trouble swallowing, excessive drooling, and breathing problems. Your child may begin eating less because they are having trouble feeding.

 APA style requires placing a caption directly beneath the image, which should be embedded in the text. Include the following information in the APA citation:


A figure number. All photographs in the paper should be numbered consecutively. Write the word "Figure," followed by a number, followed by a period. This should appear in italics. Example: Figure 1.
The title of the photograph in italics. Include the full title of the photograph, followed by a period. Example: Walking Through the Woods.
A description. Write a brief explanation of why the photograph is being used. Alternatively, you may simply include the photograph's date of publication.
 Include a complete citation in the References section at the end of the paper. The full citation should be written as follows:


Begin with the author's name (in this case the author is the creator of the image, or the photographer). Write the last name, followed by a comma, followed by the initial of the first name, followed by a period. Example: Parks, G. If the author's name is unavailable, leave it out.
Write the word "Photographer" in parenthesis. Make sure the word is capitalized, and follow it with a period on the outside of the parenthesis. Example: (Photographer).
Write the year the image was created.
Write the title of the work in italics. Follow it with a period. Example: American Gothic, Washington, DC.
Write the word "Photograph" in parenthesis. Make sure the word is capitalized, and follow it with a period on the outside of the parenthesis. Example: (Photograph).
If you found the image online, write the date the image was retrieved in this format: Month Day, Year. Example: February 28, 2013.
Write the word "from" followed by the URL. Example: from: http://www.parkspictures.com

, Do your best to track down the name of the photographer, the name of the photograph, and the date it was created. If there's a piece of information you are unable to find, leave it out.

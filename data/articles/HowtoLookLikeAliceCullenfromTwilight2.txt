 Be positive and cheerful, a friend to everyone. Alice looks on the bright side of things, and always thinks the best of her family and friends.
 She has a very graceful "prance" or skip and her run is described like a gazelle's run. Try ballet lessons to become more graceful--and after all, Alice's movements are like a dancer's--or simply try not to channel Bella when you walk.
 Alice is considered very sarcastic and funny. With her quotes: " Stop worrying Bella, you're going to go prematurely grey," "I think she is going into hysterics, maybe you should slap her!" and "It sounded like you were having Bella for lunch, so we came to see if you would share," Alice is known for her quirky sense of humor. However, she has tact and knows when to be serious.
 Alice is never mean! She is kind and sweet to everybody, except when they mess with her family! Always smile when people are talking. But when they are talking about something serious, listen, very carefully, and then they will want to be around you.
 But don't overdo it. If you walk too fast you'll most likely fall over, so walk in a decent speed, but faster than usual.
 Always smile. Don't make it look too obvious and make it look like a vampire.

 A degree in actuary science is not required to take the needed exams and enter this field. Instead, you can enter any university program that offers a strong foundation in calculus, statistics, probability, economics, finance, management, and computer science. Consider majoring in math, business, or statistics., If you are leaning towards majoring in math, business, or statistics look for a program that offers an actuary emphasis, minor, or sub-focus. This will ensure that you will receive some of the core training necessary to pass a Validation of Educational Experience (VEE) and qualify for actuary exams later on., As a student in a math, business, or statistics major (as opposed to an actuary science major), not every aspect of your program will be geared towards passing future actuarial exams. However, your department should be aware of such requirements and be able to meet them. Look for information about actuarial exam preparation on the schoolâ€™s website, or inquire about this from recruitment representative., There can be one notable benefit to pursuing a degree in math, business, or statistics: background diversity. When a firm is hiring actuaries for its team, they will not want everyone to have the same exact educational background and training. Diverse backgrounds create a more fertile environment for ideas to flow.
 Another benefit to entering a degree in math, business, or statistics is that it may give you more freedom to play on your strengths. Whereas a degree in actuarial science will give you a well-rounded encounter with many aspects of the field, a degree in math, business, or statistics allows you to specialize in an area where you excel.

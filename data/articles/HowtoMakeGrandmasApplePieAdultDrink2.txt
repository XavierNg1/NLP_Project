 Have the party shot recipient lie on their back or sit in a chair with their head back. Tell them to open their mouth wide.
 To start the drink, pour 1/3 of a mouthful of apple cider into recipient's mouth. Don't let them swallow just yet.
 Pour 1/3 of a mouthful of spiced dark rum into recipient's mouth, on top of the cider.
 Top off mix with twirl of whipped cream sprinkled with a little cinnamon.
 If the recipient was seated in a chair with their head back, have them swallow as they bring their head forward. The result should taste just like apple pie!

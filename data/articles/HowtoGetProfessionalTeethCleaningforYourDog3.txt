 Pets, like people, need regular dental care. Your dog should get regular brushings, eat quality food, and enjoy teeth-cleaning treats. It should also get regular oral X-rays, dental exams, and professional dental cleanings to prevent serious medical conditions like periodontal disease.Dogs should get a professional check up at least once per year, and weekly brushings at home if your pet will tolerate it.
 Dogs, like people, can also develop periodontal, or gum, disease. In fact, gum disease is five times more likely to occur in pets than in humans. Plaque forms on your dog’s teeth and, if left untreated, can lead to gum inflammation. Chronic inflammation of the gums can destroy bone and result in tooth loss.Regular dental cleanings can help prevent gum disease in dogs.
 Periodontal disease can cause extreme pain in dogs, but it is not the only culprit. Some dogs are also prone to broken teeth, which is often only discovered when a dog undergoes a dental exam. Your dog could also be suffering from bleeding gums or abscessed teeth, which also cause pain. More often than not these conditions are not readily apparent to the average dog owner., Every dog is different, which means that maintaining a dog’s dental health will be different for each dog. While your Fido may only need to have his teeth cleaned periodically, Fluffy may need more regular care. Consult your veterinarian about an individualized dental health plan for your dog.Most dogs will need oral exams and professional cleanings once a year beginning at six months of age.

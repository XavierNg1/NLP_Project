 Most machines require 2 separate rolls of film. The machine's directions should give step by step details on how to load the rolls of film.;
, Turn the laminating machine on so that it can warm up. The specific directions that come with your laminator should tell how long to preheat the machine. Most machines have a light that signals when the machine is turned on and another light that signals when the machine is ready to laminate.
 You will want to cut and trim the item to be laminated to look exactly as you wish it to look once the plastic has been fused into place.
 Push it right up next to the rolls of film, so that the machine can grab hold of the paper easily.
 The laminator will begin to pull the paper into the machine.
 Let it continue to run to get the film at a place where you can cut it.
 Try not to start and stop the lamination in the middle of a project.
 Some machines have a perforated edge for tearing the laminating film.

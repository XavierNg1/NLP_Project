Go to http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/usda_food_patterns/EstimatedCalorieNeedsPerDayTable.pdf to see a chart of calorie allowances.
For example, a 30-year-old man who is sedentary should eat 2,400 calories, while a moderately active man would eat 2,800 and an active man would eat 3,000.

Use a calorie counter to total up your usual caloric intake.



If you are close to the number on the USDA chart, you can cut up to 25 percent of your calories for healthy weight loss.
If you are far above the number on the USDA chart, you will need to gradually reduce until you reach the recommended number, and reduce 25 percent of the recommended daily intake in the weeks following.
People who cut their food intake drastically can feel dizzy, nauseous and have health complications. You may lose 3 lbs. a week simply by reducing the amount you eat and increasing your activity.

Subtract the 2 numbers to calculate the number of calories you are cutting. For example, 600 for a 30-year-old man and 500 for a 30-year-old woman.
Multiply that number by 7 to see how many calories can be totaled just with your diet. For example, 4,200 for the man and 3,500 for a woman.

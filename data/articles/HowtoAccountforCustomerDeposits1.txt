 While a customer deposit sounds like straight income to you, it is in fact a liability to the business because you "owe" the customer something. This is why you need to create a special account.Think of an account as like a line item on your personal budget.
Check to make sure that this "Customer Deposits" account has not already been created under another name.;
, All financial transactions must be entered in the company's general financial ledger. Each transaction is listed as a debit or credit and for every debit there must be a credit.


Debits increase expenses, assets (such as cash or furniture) and dividend accounts. Credits decrease these accounts. An easy way to remember this is D-E-A-D (Debits-Expenses-Assets-Dividends).
For example, if you are paying a utility bill you would debit accounts payable and credit cash.
 In your accounting journal, debit the Cash account and credit the Customer Deposits account in the same amount.
 Note on the invoice the amount of the deposit previously paid and subtract it from the total amount owed.
 Credit the Revenue account while debiting Accounts Receivable and Customer Deposits.


Revenue is recognized when the work has been done and the customer has been billed, not when the money is received.

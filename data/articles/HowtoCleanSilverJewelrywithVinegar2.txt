 The aluminum foil should be face up in the pan. You can use any oven safe kitchen pan that will hold your jewelry. Once you have the pan lined, distribute your jewelry across the surface so that each piece of jewelry is making contact with the aluminum foil., In a medium bowl, mix together a cup of boiling water, a tablespoon of baking soda and a tablespoon of salt. Add the mixture to the pan with the jewelry.
 Pour half a cup of vinegar into the pan. You should see it bubble.
 Leave your jewelry in the pan for ten minutes. If you like, you can stir the jewelry around every few minutes, making sure each piece is touching the bottom of the pan.
 Use the pressure washer in your sink to completely rinse your jewelry. Be careful not to let it fall into the garbage dispenser. Then, dry your jewelry with a clean towel and store it in a safe place.

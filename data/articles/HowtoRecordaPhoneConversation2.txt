 These microphones are available at electronic and phone stores, and typically come mounted in suction cups to allow easy attachment to the handset.
 Plug the microphone's audio output jack into a computer, tape recorder, or other such device. A tape recorder or digital portable recorder has the advantage of being relatively small and portable, but a computer has advantages when it comes to cataloging and organizing your conversations.


A good basic audio editing program for your computer is Audacity. Audacity is free, simple, and useful for things like clipping dead space off the ends of conversations. It can also export the conversation files in a variety of formats for easy storage. Audacity can be downloaded here.
 Secure the microphone to the handset near the receiver (the end you speak into). Test the microphone by speaking into the receiver and playing back the audio record on your input device.


If you're worried the microphone's suction cup won't hold, secure the microphone with tape to ensure that your recording won't be interrupted.
 Turn on the induction coil microphone when you pick up the handset. Turn it off and stop recording when you're finished.

 If you do not have iTunes, you can download it for free from the Apple website.;
, It does not matter in which order you connect it. When you connect it, you will see a window highlighting two options; one is Restore and the other is Update. If your iPad has the Connect to iTunes screen, select Restore.


When you select an option at the top of the screen, you'll see the Apple logo. Under this you will see a bar saying downloading software; this usually takes up to 3-4 hours depending on the speed of the internet connection.
 Select the Restore option again. When you do this, you will see that the screen of the iPad displays the Apple logo and a small loading bar, this means your iPad software is being restored.


After the loading bar has been fully loaded the iPad shuts down and restarts. When it restarts you will have the on screen set-up guide. Follow this guide to set-up your iPad.

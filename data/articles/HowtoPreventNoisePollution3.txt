 Don't be part of the problem by leaning on your horn every time someone looks at you wrong on the street. Use your horn only when absolutely necessary, as a way to let someone know that you're present or warn them when they're about to collide with something. It's good driving etiquette, and makes life more pleasant for city-dwellers.
 The sound of a car without a muffler chugging down the street is never welcome, so make sure you're not the one causing noise pollution in your neighborhood and spring to get your car fixed. Keeping your car in good, quiet working order will be appreciated by everyone who lives near you.


The same goes for your lawnmower and any other noisy equipment you might use outdoors.
To have an even greater impact on noise in your area, consider walking or biking instead of using a car whenever possible.
 It might sound beautiful to you, but respect the fact that others might not feel the same way. Your music shouldn't be noticeable outside your own home. If you know that the neighbors don't mind, feel free to keep your windows open and let them enjoy your musical taste, but don't just assume that everyone wants to hear your favorite opera as much as you do.


If you play a noisy instrument or are in a band, make sure to practice during reasonable hours.
If you're having a party and planning to play loud music, let your neighbors know beforehand so you can avoid conflict.
 Whether the rule is unspoken or prominently published, make sure you don't make noise after hours. Don't put your neighbors in the position of having to ask you to be quiet, since it's awkward and makes for unfriendly relations. Do your best to be a good neighbor so you can expect the same from those around you.


This is especially important if you live in an apartment building. Don't vacuum or do housework late at night, since they'll be able to hear you walking around.

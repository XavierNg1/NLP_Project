 Fresh herbs are loved by many people, especially those who enjoy cooking and growing their own food. There are several possible ideas here:

Snip off a large bunch of fresh herbs, tie a rubber band around them and a ribbon, and give the fresh bundle to someone as a gift.



 


Grow live herbs to give to people. Be sure to use gift-worthy potting containers.






Dry your herbs and give the sprig of herbs as a gift. Be sure to label and if you like, add the culinary uses for each herb to the label. You might like to give the dried herbs as a bundle or already added to little containers.

, The sorts of things to make include:


Jams or jelies
Preserves

Sauces
Pickles
Syrups
Candied flowers

, Place seeds into homemade seed packets, label them using your printer or calligraphy hand and let the receiver know that they're seeds straight from your garden. These can be wonderful family heirloom seed sharing opportunities, or you can give seeds to neighbours, as a housewarming gift, or as a way to remind people to plant their own veggie garden.
 As with the herbs, you can choose to give cut flowers in a bunch or give a living flower in a suitable container. When cutting them for a bunch, choose the best flowers and add flair with a ribbon or bow. Making a posy adds special value to the gift.


All flowers can make wonderful gifts, from roses to daisies. Be sure to select the ones that are growing strongest when giving them as gifts to be planted in someone else's garden.
 Why not offer another keen gardener some of your delightful homemade compost, especially where they haven't had a chance to make any? You might also consider making them some compost tea and placing it in a bottle for ready fertilising. Always label clearly and clear the compost delivery with the recipient first!

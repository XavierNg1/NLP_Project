 Many schools have monitors, cameras, security guards, and teachers on the lookout for people leaving school. You may have to take some big risks if you decide to skip school this way.


Read up on your school’s rules before your skip day, and be ready for the consequences if you get caught.
 If you want to get off campus for the day, you need to get away when you are least likely to be noticed. This is usually when there are lots of students around.


Leaving at the very beginning of the day will probably get you noticed, since most kids are going into the school and not away from it.
Try going to your first class so you can at least be seen, and then slip away in between classes. You can also do this between afternoon classes, or around lunchtime.
 You don’t want to alert your teachers and parents that you haven’t been in class by being late coming back. While you’re out and about, check the time every so often to see how much free time you have left.


Give yourself enough time to change back into your school clothes (if you’ve changed out of them) and get back on school grounds by the time the last bell rings.
Be sure to turn up at the regular time and place your bus arrives or your parents pick you up at the end of the school day. If teachers see you and ask where you’ve been, say that you‘ve been in the bathroom sick or at an appointment. Just make sure your parents don't hear from a teacher that you weren’t in class.

 Glass jars that are heat resistant work best because you will be pouring hot wax into them. If you're recycling old mugs, plant holders, or other containers, inspect them for cracks so that the wax won't aggravate the infrastructure.;
, Set the jars on a baking tray and place them in the oven on the "keep warm" setting or a low heat while you prepare the wax. Leave them in the oven for a few minutes to make them warmer than room temperature., You can buy pre-made candle wicks from a craft store with the metal collar attached at the end or put together your own. Buy the metal collars and uncut wicks separately, thread the wick through the collar, and use pliers to squeeze it tightly shut.It's best not to place a wick in a candle without a collar. The metal prevents the flame from heating the bottom of the glass jar to the point of breaking.If you use uncut wicks then you won't be limited to candle size or height.
For best results, buy pre-waxed wicks.
 Be careful as they may still be hot. Melt a few wax flakes in the microwave and place a few in the bottom of each jar. Before the wax cools, place the metal end or bare end of your wick in the wax and let it set.
 Lay a pencil or chopstick across the top of your jar and wrap or tape the wick to it. You want to make sure the wick remains upright so that when you pour the wax in, the wick won't fall down into the candle.

 This is needed because this determines the length of your antenna.;
, For the example we can use a copper wire and a piece of copper plating. Also you will need a co-axial cable (75 ohm is better than 50 ohm, for Wi-Fi 50 ohm is better than 75 ohm).
 This is done by using the frequency value from step 1 to find the wavelength of the signal. To do this you simply need to divide the speed of light (c = 299 792 458 m/s) by the frequency (f). In the case of 2.45GHz the wavelength is 12.236 centimeter (4.8Â in). Usually monopole antennas are quarter-wavelength structures, so the length of the wire should be 12.236/4 = 3.0509cm

, This way you can pare it back based on performance.
 This is basically used to form a theoretical mirror image of the antenna. Simply use the copper plate that you picked up earlier. It should be at least half a wavelength square.
,, The ground conductor is now above the ground-plane. Fold the ground conductor back and solder it to the copper ground plane.

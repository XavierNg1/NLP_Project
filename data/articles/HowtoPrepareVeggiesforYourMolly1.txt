 Peel the skin off of the fruit, making sure to get it all off. Dispose of it properly along with any rotten parts of the banana.;
, Once the fruit has been diminished into a pile of slices, keep chopping the slices into smaller pieces until they are small enough for your fish to eat it.


If you have more than one fish, cut one big slice. Drop it into the tank, and let it sink to the bottom so all of the fish can nibble on it.
 Drop them in one at a time. However, only feed it a few pieces. Don't leave the banana with the fish for more than half an hour; otherwise, the tank water may start to get cloudy.

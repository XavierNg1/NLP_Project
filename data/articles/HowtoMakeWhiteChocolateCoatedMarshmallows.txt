 In a microwave-safe bowl, pour the candy melts in the bowl and heat them in the microwave until fully melted. Mix every 30 seconds with a spoon to avoid the chocolate from scorching.
, In the middle of each marshmallow, gently poke a cake pop stick or a wooden skewer into each jumbo marshmallow.

Avoid poking the marshmallows too hard or the marshmallows will not stay on the stick.
, Swirl and tap each marshmallow around to get rid of an excess chocolate.,,, Once the white chocolate has set and hardened, wrap the covered marshmallow with plastic wrap and ribbons if desired. Enjoy!

 Let the birthday kid have the first turn walking around the circle. They say “chugga” for each kid they aren’t picking, and they say “choo choo” when they want the kid to chase them., Find four or five different sized cardboard boxes. Wrap them in white paper. Make some wheels and make the front of the boxes look like train cars. Then set out a basket of crayons so the kids can color on the train cars.Another option would be to wrap a bunch of small boxes so that each kid can have a small train of their own to color on.
 Buy some conductor hats, red or blue bandanas, and wooden train whistles. Set a hat open side up on the table. Then lay the bandana and whistle on top of that. Use twine to bundle it up. Let each child take one home as a party gift.

 Your Galaxy S3 needs to be locked on to T-Mobile for a specific amount of time, as stated in the contract or agreement. On the other hand, there are certain conditions where you can have your phone unlocked even if you’re still within the contract:


You are the owner of the Galaxy S3 and can provide the account details related to the phone’s contract.
You’ve already paid the Galaxy S3’s full price.
The unit was not reported as stolen or lost.
 If you’re phone’s eligible, the customer service representative will have your phone unlocked without extra charges, interests or fines. You can reach T-Mobile’s customer service department through this number: 1-877-453-1304.


The Customer Care hotline is available from 3 AM up to 10 PM (Pacific Time) daily.
 Insert a SIM card from another carrier (either local or international) and try making an outgoing call or text message to see if it can connect.

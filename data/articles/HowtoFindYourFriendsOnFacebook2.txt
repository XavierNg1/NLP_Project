 The page will refresh and Facebook will generate a list of “People You May Know” based on the information in your profile.


You may want to browse this list for friends you didn’t think of in your original search.
You can also use this list if you can’t remember someone’s name.
 You will find this box toward the right-hand side of the screen. This box will display the email address that is currently associated with your account.
 Follow the directions provided by Facebook to import email contacts from the email address of your choice. The directions will vary depending on your email service provider.


For example, if you use Gmail, you will be required to log in to your Gmail account, click on "Export" within Gmail, and select the contacts you want uploaded to Facebook.
 Facebook will search for your friends using the email addresses and names imported from your email account.

 Firstly, make sure that your headphones are free from any knots or tangles.;
, Before you start folding the headphones, make a fist and place the earbuds of the headphone on the lower bottom of your palm.
 Wrap until you have a short length of wire left to tie the knot.
 Carefully take it off from your hand and wrap the rest around the middle of the headphones and make a simple knot.
 You can now store it in your pocket or wherever you want to.

 Currently, Spotify does not offer student discounts to all of the countries in which it is available. To be eligible:


In the United States, you must be currently enrolled (not on a leave of absence or recently accepted) in a US college or university.
In the United Kingdom, you must be currently enrolled in a UK university and also have an NUS Extra Card or a UNIDAYS account.;
, In the United States, this typically means having an account that ends in .edu.


If you've already signed up for Spotify with a non-edu e-mail address, you can change your e-mail address by clicking your username in the top-right corner of the http://spotify.com page, clicking "Account", and then clicking the black "Edit Profile" that appears in the main page.
If you are in the United Kingdom, this requirement doesn't apply since you will be using an external account to verify your status as a student.
 If you are in the United Kingdom, your billing details should be within the UK.
 To apply a student discount to your Spotify account, it must be the only discount you are using.

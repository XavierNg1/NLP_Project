 These can be very reassuring, and helpful for a person who has already fallen or is afraid of falling in the bathtub. They should be readily available at a pharmacy or bath supply store.
 These are especially useful if there has already been a fall, or if there is apprehension about falling because of frailty or fatigue.Pharmacies or bath supply stores are again the best places to shop for these.
 Many bathtubs may already have this sandpaper-textured tape affixed to the bottom of the tub, but it could help to add more in the middle area where most of the standing is done when showering. Non-slip mats (for drying off) are available for the floor just outside the tub as well., This will give the person more control while washing. It is also much safer, since it prevents falls by 1) eliminating the need to maneuver under the shower head to wash hard-to-reach areas, and 2) allowing them to sit in a shower chair while washing., Test the water temperature by hand. Let both the hot and cold water run for a few minutes each to check for major temperature fluctuations. If the temperature changes from hot to cold frequently, contact the landlord or hire a plumber to resolve the problem.


If the person lives in an apartment, it’s best to do the test in the early morning when other residents will be showering, and fluctuations would be most common.
Check the water heater’s temperature gauge, and make sure it is set to 120 degrees. This should help prevent scalding temperatures.

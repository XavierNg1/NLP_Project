 Some good ones to try are Six Flags Belgium (Click the tutorial button and click one of the three things that are listed in the menu to get it), Crazy Castle and Bumbly Bazaar.;
, Build the toilets, rides, food stalls etc. Make it look like an ordinary park. Don't worry, you are going to torture them. You just need to attract visitors first. Who would want to take there kids to a hazardous park?

, Only do this step when you have 500 + guests in your park. Now let the torture begin!

, Do NOT delete your Information Kiosk. Instead, raise the prices for maps and umbrellas higher. People will get confused and buy park maps to try to find their way (which they won't).
 Then, at the end of it make a square. When people start going in it, make a No Way Out sign, so they can get in and not get out. Laugh at their misery.
 That means people will be attracted to that bit, go in and get trapped!

, Build rides and stuff. Link the two squares together with a path. Now people are more attracted to it.
 As they get tired and bored, raise prices. I've discovered that they are willing to pay #5.00 for an umbrella! Torture until you get bored of them, then start again!

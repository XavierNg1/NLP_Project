Remember that people will probably gossip about you and your relationship with celebrity. Expect that most of this gossip will not be true.
Don’t gossip to the media about your relationship with a celebrity. Don’t break her trust in you if you want to keep dating.Be aware that lots of people might ask your celebrity date for an autograph or picture.
Consider going somewhere discrete where you’re less likely to draw the attention of the public.
 Make sure to act confident even if you’re nervous about dating a celebrity.


Be yourself. Remember that you’ve caught the attention of a celebrity if she chooses to go on a date with you.
Try to find common interests. Focus on things that you share.
Be positive. Smile. Don’t complain about things that are wrong with your life.
Be humorous. Laughing and telling jokes can help to lighten the mood.
Don’t exaggerate, boast or lie—even if you’re nervous and intimidated by your celebrity date.
 Concentrate on your date.


Don’t give the impression that you are dating her just because she is a celebrity. Show your date that you’re interested in the real person.Don’t frown. Don’t argue with your date.
Feel free to compliment her work, but don’t ask about celebrity gossip.

Clock insert for the hockey puck. From a craft supply store.;
, An inexpensive press is just fine for this project.
Forstner bit for the drill press, same size as base of the clock insert. See "tips" for an example of standard dimensions. A Forstner bit is designed to "sweep out" the region it is drilling. You can also do the job with an ordinary hole saw and a gouge, but it would be lots more work.



Remember your high school geometry? If so, you can use that technique.
Or just use a ruler, and estimate the centre location. Measure the distance from the estimated centre location to the edges of the puck, and keep moving the estimated centre, until you get the puck centre located.
Lines on the puck should, ideally, be kept to the central region so they will disappear when you drill out the hole for the clock insert.
, You do not need speed, as hockey pucks are soft compared to metal. Rather, you are looking for accuracy. Also, using a slow speed means less risk of melting the edge of the hole.
 You do not want to drill all the way through.
, The exact depth depends upon the clock insert you are using.
, You are done!

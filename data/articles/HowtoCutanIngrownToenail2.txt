 If your ingrown toenail is causing you pain, then consider picking up some topical pain reliving cream to put on the area. Keep in mind that these creams will not heal your ingrown toenail, but they should make your ingrown toenail a little more bearable., If your ingrown toenail is painful, then using a cold compress may also help to soothe the pain. Try wrapping an ice pack in a towel and holding it on your ingrown toenail for about five to 10 minutes.


Make sure that you do not hold the ice pack on your toe for too long or you may cause tissue damage and frostbite. Allow your skin to return to its normal temperature before reapplying the ice pack.
 Cutting an ingrown toenail yourself can be difficult and painful. Ingrown toenails can go deep into your skin and cutting an ingrown toenail may lead to pain, cause an infection, or make the ingrown toenail worse. Consider seeing a podiatrist to cut your ingrown toenail rather than trying to do it on your own.A podiatrist can provide medication to numb the area before doing anything to it.
A podiatrist can also remove the root of the ingrown toenail to prevent further problems.
 Ingrown toenails can sometimes become infected and the infection may even spread to other parts of your body if it is not dealt with right away. Call your doctor if you notice signs of an infection, which often include:Swelling
Redness
Pain
Pus draining from the affected area
A foul smell
Skin that looks like it is puffed out

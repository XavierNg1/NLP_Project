 You might not have the time or storage space to put a large evacuation kit together ahead of time. If this is the case and you find yourself in an emergency situation, choose the largest bag you have at your disposal.
 You should add food and water to the bag first, since these are the most important for your cat. Grab what food you have at hand - either a bag of dry food or several cans of wet food. You should also add several bottles of water.


Also include your cat's water and food bowls.
 Any paperwork you have for your cat - vaccine, owner, or insurance paperwork - should also go in the bag. If you don't plan on making your kit ahead of time, at least keep this paperwork in one place so it's easy to take if you need it.
 Your cat probably has a few go-to toys that are its favorites. When you're putting together a last minute evacuation kit, include these in your bag. They'll give your cat something familiar in what can be an unfamiliar and sometimes scary situation.
 You might not have time to get an extra or travel litter pan during an emergency, but you probably have a container of litter and a scoop at home. Include these, along with any container that is big enough for your cat to use as a litter box. The container should be at least big enough for your cat to stand up in.
 Towels will keep your cat comfortable and warm in an emergency. You can also use them to swaddle your cat if you don't have an actual cat carrier.

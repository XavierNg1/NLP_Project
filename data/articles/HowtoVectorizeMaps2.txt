 To see better, the map has been filled with green. In practice it's better not to fill it, so you can see clearly what you're tracing.]] Draw with the Bezier pen tool (shift+F6). It's more useful than the pencil tool. This tool has two modes â€“ you can go along clicking to make a polygonal line with nodes at the vertices, or you can click and drag to make Bezier curves. If you drag, you will see that a line appears at each node that drives the shape of the curve. It doesn't matter if you don't do it perfectly at first. You can retouch it later. In any case, if you don't like where you put a node, you can eliminate the last node you drew by pressing the delete key.

For making maps, it is often sufficient to make polygonal lines.
It's usually a good idea to zoom in on the area where you're working (magnifying tool).
In the example, polygonal lines have been used to trace the outline of the island of Ireland.
 In the examples shown, the objects are colored to distinguish them, but it is more practical to use transparent objects, so that you can follow what you are tracing on the original map. Everything that has to do with the fill and outline color is in Object->Fill and stroke.

 You might have the urge to try to frighten aggressive behavior out of your child. While many people do subscribe to this type of parenting, it generally makes the situation worse. When you talk to your child, sit down or get at eye level. Keep a calm voice.. Also, make sure that any physical contact is used as a way to connect empathetically to your child and not as a punishment.If you yell at, or hit, your child when they have upset you, you will be reinforcing aggression as a way to handle emotions.
 When your child is behaving aggressively, sometimes you only need to point it out to end the aggression. Tell your child that their actions are hurtful to others around them, and instruct them on how to behave appropriately by redirecting them to the coping skills that you’ve taught them. To keep their attention, maintain eye contact and keep a hand on their shoulder or hold their hand.Ask your child how they could better handle the situation in the future. Ask, “Next time you feel frustrated, what should you do?”

, If your de-escalation attempts fail, your child may be overwhelmed. Take them away from the current environment (including the people around them) to let them reset. This can be done by moving into a hallway or even making a brief trip to the restroom.If you are unable to remove your child from the situation immediately (for example, during a funeral service), you can distract them from the situation with a toy or snack.
 When you child has acted aggressively, they should apologize to the other person or people involved. Depending on what happened, they may need to take other steps to repair the relationship, such as replacing a toy they broke. By addressing the situation, your child will develop their conscience and forethought, both of which are important for long-term relationships and emotional health.

 Once your crown is finished, you can add ribbon or twine to give it a fuller look. Simply wrap the ribbon or twine around the crown and between the bunches of baby’s breath. You can leave tails of ribbon at the back to tie a bow.Choose a ribbon that matches with the overall look of your outfit or the event.
 You can also add other flowers to the crown to give it a pop of colour. Baby’s breath can still be the dominant look, but you may want to add a few small daisies or some greenery. You can simply tape these additional flowers onto the crown the same way that you attached the baby’s breath.


Disperse other flowers or greenery throughout the crown.
 Once you are finished constructing the baby’s breath crown, you should spray it with water in order to keep it fresh. For instance, you may be making these crowns the day before a wedding. A light spray of water can help them stay fresh. You should also keep the flowers in the refrigerator.

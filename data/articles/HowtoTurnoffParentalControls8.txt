 This is perhaps the easiest and safest way to adjust the parental controls, as the person who imposed the parental controls has your best interests at heart and may be more willing to adjust them if you discuss the reasons why you think the controls should be lifted.


Start by asking your parents or the administrator why they have imposed Parental Controls on your account. Are you using social media like Facebook too much or playing certain inappropriate games too often? Are you neglecting your health, social circle or studies as the result of too much time online?
After understanding main reasons for the parental controls, try to initiate a change in your behavior or at least show your parents you are trying to change your approach to online activities. This might make them reconsider their actions and agree to an adjustment of the parental controls.
 If your parents or the administrator feel satisfied that you are responsible enough to manage your own online activities, they may provide you with the password to the administrator account.
 Some parents may not feel comfortable handing over complete access to the administrator account and leaving you unsupervised. So, if they request some restrictions or guidelines around your online use, try to be flexible and agree to them. It may take time for your parents to feel assured you can navigate content online without their supervision.
 While it may be tempting as a parent to install every block, limit, and filter on your childâ€™s computer or on the shared home computer, be aware that new sites are added to the Internet every day so it is simply not possible for parental control software to catch every suspicious site.In fact, some parental control software can also block useful information like access to personal health issues and topics your child may need to be aware of.
Parental control software is not a substitute for active parent interaction with your children and conversations around their Internet use.

 During winter it may be a good idea to make sure your cat doesn't spend all of its time outside. At minimum, make sure that it isn't outside at the coldest times of day and night. Be aware of the weather forecast and bring your cat inside if a storm is expected or the weather is going to get especially cold.

If your temperatures are below zero, consider letting even an outdoor cat spend time indoors, even if its only inside your garage. Domestic cats coats are not made to withstand really, really cold temperatures. They will need your help to stay safe and warm., If your cats are spending a lot of time outside, or you are caring for feral cats, you may need to feed them outside. If you do this, place the food and water close to a shelter area. This will make it so they don't need to go far to get access to it if weather conditions are very bad.If you have already made a small shelter for your cat, for instance out of a foam cooler, consider making a second one to house your cat's food. Placing it next to the cat's shelter will allow the cat to have easy access.
 If you are feeding cats outside during the winter, you need to keep the food and water temperature above freezing. One way to do this is to warm the food or water before putting it out. Warm up each of these things just slightly, so that your cat will have a warm dinner and the food and water won't freeze before the cat can enjoy them.You may also want to consider buying a heated water or food bowl for an outside cat. These products plug into regular outlets and are typically available for purchase online.
It is really important that you don't let your cat's water freeze. A cat can become dehydrated very quickly without access to water. This is particularly important for cats that live outside full time in climates that freeze in the winter. They may have no other access to unfrozen water.

 You may be drawn to a historical tradition based on your own ethnic background or you may feel drawn to a particular tradition for your own personal reasons. There are now many reconstructionist groups active around the world working in many different traditions. It is usually best to pick just one to study so you can focus yourself better, but it is not uncommon to explore several different traditions at different times.;
, Your library, bookstore and the internet are places to look for literature about your chosen tradition. Keep in mind that modern scholars, especially through the middle of the 20th century, may be expressing some of their own cultural biases in their writing. For this reason, it is a good idea to look for the most recent scholarship and try to find several different sources.
 Many traditional belief systems do not have a body of "canonical" literature (such as the Christian Bible). Still, there may be a body of literature that will help you understand the culture, practices and beliefs of the ancients. It would be a good idea to learn the original language of your tradition. For example, modern Hellenic Recons often learn ancient Greek so that they can read ancient Greek texts in the original language.
 You will be reconstructing a tradition that grew out of a culture that may be very different from your own. It is good to learn to understand your own cultural biases so that they do not become an obstacle for you.
 For example, some followers of Roman reconstructionism look to Japanese Shinto to help them understand Roman paganism because they feel there are some similarities between the two traditions.
 Either on line or better yet, a face to face group.

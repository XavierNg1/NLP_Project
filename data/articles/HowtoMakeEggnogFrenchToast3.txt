 Coat a medium to large baking dish in butter or nonstick cooking spray. Cut your loaf of bread into slices. The slices should be 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) thick. Stack them in the pan in even, overlapping layers.


You can use a rectangular dish or a deep dish pie pan., Break the eggs into a large bowl. Pour the eggnog, vanilla, and cinnamon into the bowl. Whisk together the ingredients until they are completely blended.
 Pour your mixture over the bread slices. Make sure you pour evenly so each slice is completely coated. Cover your dish with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place in the fridge overnight.


If you don't want to let them set overnight, make sure you leave it in the fridge for at least 3 hours.
 Take your pan out of the fridge. Preheat your over at 350 degrees. Uncover your pan and set it aside.
 Put the butter, syrup, and brown sugar in a saucepan. Stir them together and cook over medium heat. Keep stirring the mixture until it begins to foam and bubble.
 Slowly pour your topping over the bread slices. Make sure you coat them and pour some in between the slices. Bake uncovered for 40 to 45 minutes. The top of the bread should be golden brown. Dust with powdered sugar and serve.

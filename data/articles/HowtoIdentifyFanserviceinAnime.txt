 Is it relevant to the plot? Certain things are allowed as a means of moving the story along. If a character is in a sexual or romantic situation that contradicts his or her personal morals (e.g. a homosexual encounter, a tryst, or an encounter with an enemy of the family), it's probably a vehicle for character development. This is also the case for situations involving a long-standing, serious relationship (as opposed to a one-night-stand) or a rape. If the event is random and doesn't really help the story (if there even is a story), it's probably fanservice.;
, Is the viewer's perspective arranged so that you're looking right up the leading lady's skirt (or down her cleavage)? Does the camera zoom in on a secretary's butt as she leans over? Is the camera placed at some other odd angle that gives you a front-row seat to a character's naughty bits? If so, it's probably fanservice. Sexual scenes that aren't fanservice actually tend to censor this sort of thing, focusing instead on artistic camera angles that complement the sexual or romantic tension of the situation.
 If every single wrinkle in a busty woman's too-small top is drawn in minute detail, or every drop of sweat on her leg is painstakingly animated as she does gymnastics, it's probably fanservice.
 Does a boy's gym uniform get stolen, forcing him to swim in his tighty-whiteys? Does a girl's shirt get caught on her chair, tearing the fabric and revealing her lacy push-up bra? Are the girls' school uniforms so short that you can see the butt of their panties as they walk down the hall? If they weren't fanservice, these situations probably wouldn't happen because they're incredibly unrealistic.
 Sparkles. Shines. Popsicles. Lollipops. Erect nipples. Boners. Bodily fluids. Lingerie. Men or women who are so well-endowed that their proportions seem physically impossible in nature. Any of these could signify fanservice.

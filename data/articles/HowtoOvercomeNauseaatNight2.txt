 Bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast are the foods that have been proven to help prevent diarrhea, but can also help symptoms of nausea and vomiting. The BRAT diet is not meant to be used long-term, as it does not provide necessary nutrients to your body. Once your nausea has subsided, you should start adding in fresh fruits and vegetables and then return to your normal diet., If the BRAT diet is too restrictive, you can add bland foods into the mix. Nausea can often be made worse by spicy foods. Even if food doesn’t sound good, attempt to eat some saltine crackers or bread to try and help settle your stomach.
 Eating right before you lay down to sleep can increase nausea. Give yourself enough time to fully digest your meal before sleep. Eating close to bedtime can also increase the possibility of heartburn., Even if your nausea typically occurs at night, eating more frequent, small meals can help prevent nausea. Keeping your stomach mostly full might also help prevent nausea from becoming more severe., These tend to exacerbate nausea. Your body can also have more difficulty processing these foods. It’s best to aim for light and healthy foods (fresh fruits and vegetables) that can keep your body working smoothly.

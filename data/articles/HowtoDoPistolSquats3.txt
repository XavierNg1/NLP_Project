 If you have mastered the pistol squat with your hands in front of you, you should try clasping them behind your back instead., Using both legs, lower yourself into a traditional squat. Then try lifting one leg and stretching it straight in front of you before you raise yourself on the other leg., Lower yourself into the pistol squat, then push up with your standing leg to jump. Try doing a normal jump at first. Remain in place as you spring up. You can also try jumping sideways onto a box or bench.


Be very careful with this move. Try to avoid jumping forward or backwards as you are likelier to injure yourself.

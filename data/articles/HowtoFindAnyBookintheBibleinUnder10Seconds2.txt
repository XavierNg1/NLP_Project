 There are tabs you can buy and put you in your bible. These tabs mark each book of the Bible so that you can easily reference them. You can order them online through Amazon. Additionally, you can buy them from your local Christian or religious bookstore.


Follow the instruction guide for how to place the tabs so that they are properly aligned. These tabs are permanent, precut and adhesive. Putting on the tabs will help you become familiar with the order of the books.
 This is a version of the Bible that includes the tabs already in the Bible. This is easier than putting the tabs in your Bible.


You can also buy this kind of Bible on Amazon or from your local Christian/religious bookstore. , Look at the table of contents at the front of your Bible. Match each book name with the abbreviation on the tab so that you are familiar with how the two correspond. Keep flipping back and forth from the table of contents to each book. Familiarize yourself with one Testament, take a break, and then work with the other Testament.


Write out the books of the Bible a few times, so you can become more familiar with their order. Once again, work with just one testament at a time.
 Have someone tell you random books of the Bible and see how long it takes you to flip to that book. Choose books from one Testament, and once you get good move onto the next Testament. Once you are proficient at both, try quizzing yourself on books from the whole Bible.


Once you get good at getting to the books quickly, quiz yourself with the book and the chapter and verse. See how long it takes you to get there.

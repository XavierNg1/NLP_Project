 When you lay it down, make sure that it is completely wrinkle free and that the hems line up with the complementary hem on the opposite side.
 The paper should act as a leak-proof barrier between the layers of the shirt. Attaching this can be tricky, because it's very easy to rip the wax paper. If the paper does rip, patch it up by taping a small piece of wax paper over the hole and pinning the shirt to that. That way, if that piece rips, you don't have to re-patch it but can simply remove the patch and replace it with a new one.
 Carefully pin the lace to the shirt, being extra careful not to rip the pattern in the lace at all. Putting it through an already created hole that works with the pattern is the best idea.
 Include about an inch (2.5cm) around the edge of the lace, though the width should vary, so as to give it a unique, messy looking edge. Make sure that you spray over the entire lace piece.
 Leave an edge of white around the lace pattern. For a retro, original look, vary the thickness of the paint––in some places it can be very thick, while in other places it can be so thin that you can partially see through to the white.
 If you don't let it dry for anywhere between an hour to an entire night, you'll have to start over completely.
 Either set it aside to reuse or throw it out. If you chose to reuse it, don't worry about the paint that's already on it transferring to another piece of clothing––as long as it's dry, it shouldn't do that.
 Leave it up overnight, at the very least. If you don't have a clothesline, you can use thick wire and if you don't have clothes pins, you can use a chip clip or large paper clip.
 You're bound to get lots of admiring comments!

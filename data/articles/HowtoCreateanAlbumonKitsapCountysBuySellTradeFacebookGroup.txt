 Click the "Photos" tab at the top of the page, under the Buy Sell Trade banner. It may take quite a few seconds to load this page, but it should load, so be patient.;
,,, We still need to properly label the album and edit our photo's information!

, There are two fields we need to edit.

The top field, indicated by the top yellow arrow, is where our Album Title is. This is where you write your name, the month, and optionally include your location. (There is also a tagline field that initially says "Say something about this album...".)
The bottom yellow arrow is indicating where the photo information is put. Include a description of the item, like Size, condition, asking price(the admins do not allow "Make offer" posts, every item should have a price), and where you can meet if possible.






Here is how a correctly filled out page should look like. My album is correctly labeled as "Amanda Wearstler, August 2013, Bremerton", which is my name, the date, and my location. The photo has a detailed description of the item I am selling, including the size and condition, my asking price, and where I can meet.
, Your finished album will appear like this. You can see your album title at the top, and photos below. To add more photos you can click the "Add Photos" button in the top right corner indicated by the green arrow and repeat the previous steps. This is also how you edit your album title, once you upload a new picture your album title field will appear again and you can edit it for a new month.

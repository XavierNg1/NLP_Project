 Otherwise, create a new Excel workbook with three worksheets: Data, Chart (unless using Data Wizard) and Saves, and follow the steps below as usual.


In General, set R1C1 to Off and select Show the 10 Most Recent Documents .
In Edit, set all the first options to checked except Automatically Convert Date System . Set Display number of decimal places to blank (as integers are preferred). Preserve the display of dates and set 30 for 21st century cutoff.
In View, click on show Formula Bar and Status Bar and hover for comments of all Objects . Check Show grid lines and set all boxes below that to auto or checked.
In Chart, allow show chart names and set data markers on hover and leave the rest unchecked for now.
In Calculation, Make sure Automatically and Calculate before save are checked. Set max change to .000,000,000,000,01 without commas as goal-seeking is done a lot. Check Save external link values and Use 1904 system

In Error checking, check all the options.
In Save, select Save preview picture with new files and Save AutoRecover after 5 minutes
In Ribbon, keep all of them checked except Hide group titles and Developer .

Otherwise, Columns M and N have been omitted from this article for the sake of brevity; they calculated Total Spirallic Distance and Actual Radius. Columns O-Q are part of the Spheres_Lookup table and will be covered next.  Columns R-U are part of a fancy Goal Seeking scheme. Columns Vand W have to do with a Curve Components Chart I'm not including within this article for the sake of brevity. Columns X and Y have to do with Random Beads and will be covered later. Column Z is a former Lookup3 for variable c = Q table series, unnecessary to the current work. Column AA is a new addition.

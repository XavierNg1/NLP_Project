 If the patient has low oxygen levels for any reason, airway management is essential. A breathing tube and ventilation will be used in extreme cases.


In some cases it is necessary to insert a nasogastric tube to drain stomach contents and oral secretions. Assisted feeding may also be required.
 If patient is awake and, still importantly, has bowel sounds, the doctor may consider the cautious use of enemas or antiemetics to decrease the load of toxin. A bladder catheter may be inserted for drainage of urine, as toxins can cause urinary retention.


An antitoxin is available for children older than one year and adults, if the diagnosis of botulism is confirmed. Antibiotics are only given for wound botulism.
 The doctor or surgeon should decontaminate wound causes of botulism via irrigation and debridement. In addition, your doctor should prescribe antibiotics (high dose penicillin) and antitoxin.

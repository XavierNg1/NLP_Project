 If you have been out of the workforce for a significant length of time, it is important to show potential employers that you are capable of staying up to date. Local colleges often offer affordable classes in a variety of topics that could make you more marketable.
 Try to select classes that you will be able to engage with, but that are in line with what you would like to do.
 Many public libraries will periodically offer free education and job search assistance.

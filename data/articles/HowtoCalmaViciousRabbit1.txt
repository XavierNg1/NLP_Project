 Make a sudden yelping sound or squeal when and if your rabbit bites or nips you. This will act as a kind of signal that you’re in pain, and your rabbit will associate that with biting you. Tiny nips can just be your rabbit’s way of telling you to go away, or that you’re bugging it. They’re not trying to hurt you, just trying to let you know they don’t want to be touched or handled. Nips don’t usually hurt, and aren’t accompanied with aggression. Full bites are bad behavior that shouldn’t be encouraged or praised. These bites are painful, and the bunny might even latch onto you when he bites down.;
, Incorrect handling could be painful for your rabbit. Your rabbit might act out in aggression if it is handled incorrectly. Make sure you support its back legs, and avoid jerking your rabbit around at all. Be gentle, and support your rabbit’s spine.Gently wrapping your rabbit in a towel is a safe way to restrain it if it is acting aggressively and you need to handle it, like to administer medication. You’ll of course want to make sure the rabbit can breathe well and that its nose isn’t covered.
 If your rabbit bites or nips you when you reach out to it, it might simply be because you startled it. Rabbits can’t see very well up close; their distance vision is much stronger. So putting your hand right in front of your rabbit’s face can surprise it, which might make it feel as though it has to defend itself.Pet your rabbit from above. Try not to put your hand down over its nose. Let him begin to associate hands reaching for him as something positive, as it results in getting affection.
While you pet your rabbit, speak to it in a soothing voice. This will help him to relax and not be on the defensive.

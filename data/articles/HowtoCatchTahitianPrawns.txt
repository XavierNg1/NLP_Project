 Scout a stream during the day and return later at night.;
, The spear can be a small diameter mop handle with a spear tip fastened on, and an eating fork spear tip with the tines spread and not sharpened is better. The purpose of the spear is to pin the prawn to the stream bottom until they can be grabbed. Avoid puncturing the prawn with a sharpened spear. Prawns have claws that can reach behind their back so a glove is used.
 When it has not rained for a while and the steam depth is low till knee height or lower is good. Catching prawns is best done at night, their eyes glow from the lantern's (or flashlight's) light.
 Prawns can also be caught with a net. A rectangular shaped net with two handles on each end is superior to a round scoop net because they conform to the stream bottom by design. The front of the net has crimped-on lead weights and these weights keep the net down and further conform to the bottom.
 Tube shaped traps are used for catching prawns in bulk and they work better than the rectangular shaped traps. For simple, one-time harvesting of prawns, spears are the way to go.

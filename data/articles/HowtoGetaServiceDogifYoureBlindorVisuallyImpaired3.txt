 Your new service dog will become a member of your family. Make sure your house is ready to welcome the dog before you leave for the training program. Buy the dog a bed, food and water bowls, a leash, and a collar. Make sure you set up the dogâ€™s bed near the room where you sleep.
 Guide dogs are bred and trained to help blind or visually impaired people, but they must exercise their skills every day. They can risk losing these skills if they are not regularly practiced. These tasks can include:Crossing the street
Locating objects
Altering you to dangers like moving vehicles

, Your service dog will require physical and emotional care on a daily basis. You will need to dedicate time for feeding, grooming, and exercising your dog. If you choose an active breed like a Border Collie or Australian Shepherd, you will need to make sure the dog gets at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days.

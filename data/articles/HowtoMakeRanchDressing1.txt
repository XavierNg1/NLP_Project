 This is the creamy base of your dressing. If you don't feel like using mayonnaise, you can also use 2 cups plain, whole-fat yogurt instead, leading to a slightly healthier ranch dressing. For a "best of both worlds," use half sour cream and half plain yogurt.


Make sure you shake the buttermilk well before adding it.
If you don't have any buttermilk, whole milk will work as well. You can add the juice from 1/2 a lemon to get the sour, buttermilk taste without the buttermilk.;
, The blend of flavors and spices you add are up to you, but the basics are usually pretty standard across the board. You can't go wrong with:


3/4 Teaspoon each of salt, onion salt, and dried parsley
1/4 Teaspoon garlic salt
1/8 Teaspoon each of pepper, dill weed, and thyme

, Whip up the mixture to your desired consistency, making sure that the spices are well distributed throughout the dressing.


You can also mix the whole dressing in a seal-able jar, then shake to evenly mix up the dressing., You can serve the ranch immediately if you want, but it will always be better if you give the flavors time to mix and blend.


This dressing will last about a week in the fridge. It should be kept cold whenever it is not being eaten.

 Your magicka is going to be your main focus in terms of how you distribute points. Your use of weapons should be minimal, meaning that you won't need stamina, and you should have a group healer to keep your health up (though you should also be staying out of the thick of battles, reducing the hits you take to begin with).
 Light armor is the best choice for Sorcerers, as the armor skills boost magicka regeneration and absorption, as well as reducing spell cost.Light armor usually comes in the form of robes or clothing, at least early in the game. Enchanted equipment can also be your friend.
 Specifically, the Destruction staff. This should be your main weapon while you play, although you can also have a normal weapon available, should you find yourself in a sticky situation. You will mainly be making use of spells anyway, so the weapon is really just secondary.
 If you've chosen this skill set, you'll definitely want to make use of your summon. This creature should be drawing the attention of enemies away from you, so that you can focus on dealing damage. This is especially useful when you are on your own or your guild mates cannot come to your rescue.

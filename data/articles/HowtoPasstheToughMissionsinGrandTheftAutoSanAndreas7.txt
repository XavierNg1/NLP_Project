 Those are hands down the easiest way of doing the vigilante missions., If CJ's weapon skill is high, he probably has better range than them, so you can hang back and shoot them., That will hopefully get rid of all the criminals quickly. If you have to, while shooting and finishing off the vehicle, honk the horn , to keep cops on foot from approaching the bike. Honking the horn works on all pedestrians and cops, but not enemy gang members. Also don't let them approach too closely, because they could still knock CJ off the bike., Try to keep CJ's wanted level down to 2 stars or lower. And be extra careful on levels 10 through 12, because the shotguns can do a lot of damage., This blows up cars tremendously quickly. So drive to where you can get a quick shot on the cars, jump out, and fire away. The mini-gun is difficult to come by though at the beginning of the game. (It's in Las Venturas.), It's very easy there. Also, Fort Carson may work., This does not work with all weapons.,, This also tends to throw off their aiming.,, It is so much easier like that. If you go through Los Santos, stay as far away from the roadblocks as possible, while going full speed. And if you go through the desert, be careful to not jack knife the truck when going downhill in the tunnel., Obviously use your judgment; don't drive on rain-soaked grass on a hillside. Plan your route out carefully, so you don't have to backtrack or try to make a U-turn.,, If the front wheel touches the ground slightly before the back wheel, and you've gone far enough (i.e. right before where you stop,) the game will count it as a stoppie, making an easy gold.

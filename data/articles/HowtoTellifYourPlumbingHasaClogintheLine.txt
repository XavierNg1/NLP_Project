  While it’s still running, watch the toilet for any signs of a rise in water level or bubbling in the water, these could indicate a blockage.;
, When it gets to the point in the cycle that the water drains from the machine, inspect close by drains for water backing up into things like showers bath and basins

, If it has either risen or lowered, then there could be a blockage stopping the water flowing as freely as it should.
 The water should go down the drain in a swirling motion when the tap is at its fastest water flow speed. If the basin is slowly filling up, then you have some form of blockage.
 This indicates water flow issues, and therefore a blockage.
 Bad odors can indicate that there is debris in your drain rotting and causing a blockage.

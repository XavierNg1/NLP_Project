 When you notice your cat starting to approach you or try to climb on you, say “no” and make eye contact with your cat. This will signal to your cat that it needs to stop what it is doing.You can also try stomping your foot on the floor or tapping your hand in front of your cat as a warning.;
, Once your cat hesitates or stops moving towards you, say “Good” and toss your cat a treat. This will show your cat that it will get a reward for not walking on you. Keep the treats in your pocket and toss your cat one only when it hesitates and listens to your instruction to stay off of you.Try to throw the treat away from you, towards your cat. This will encourage your cat to stay further away from you.
 If your cat does not listen to you when you say “no” or stomp your foot, you can use negative reinforcement. Try holding a feather wand and waving it at your cat to keep it away from you. If your cat stays away from you, reward it with a treat.Another way you can do negative reinforcement is to use a squirt gun to keep your cat from walking on you. Squirt your cat with water using the squirt gun when it approaches you or starts to try to walk on you. This will often deter your cat from repeating the action.

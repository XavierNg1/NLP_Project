 Before buying any parts or putting anything together, make a complete plan for your kit.

First, decide how many drums you want, along with the depth and diameter of each drum. At the least, you will want a snare drum and a bass drum, but adding a few toms will round out your kit.
You will also need to decide on the color of your drums' shells and hardware, and the wood used for the shells. Maple, birch, and beech are all common choices for drum shells. You will need to decide on how any toms will be mounted; if you mount any toms to the bass drum, you will need the appropriate hardware to do so.;
,,,, Tighten it to the ground.
 (There's a hole that will guide you on where you will insert the toms).
 Half of the edge of the snare must be exposed and the other part is hidden at the back of the bass. Place also the floor tom at the right side counter-parting the snare drum.
 The crash and the hi-hat cymbals will be on the left side and the rest is on the right area including the ride, china and crash-ride cymbals.
 cowbell, tambourine, synthesizer, metronome, pipe bells), place those on your desired positions but remember that they must not affect or disturb your main kit.
, Place some mufflers or auto-tune equipment on the skin or inside of the drums. If you're not able or doesn't have the skill to Tune it, lend your way to the Professionals and ask for help.

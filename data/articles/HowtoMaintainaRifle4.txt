Run the full length of the barrel at least five times (more if you have shot a lot since the last cleaning).
Be sure not to reverse direction with the brush (in the barrel), push it all the way through, then all the way back (letting the bristles changed direction outside of the barrel).
 Repeat with clean cloths (still soaked in solvent) until a cloth comes out clean. Run the swabs from the receiver to the muzzle (in only this direction).


The number of times needed to clean the bore will vary greatly depending on many variables. It may take as many as 20+ passes to clean the barrel properly on a very dirty rifle.
Use a bore guide to prevent rubbing the metal rod against the initial rifling.
Use a rod which is made from a soft metal like aluminum. Harder metals can easy scratch your barrel.
 This removes any copper which may have come off of a jacketed bullet during it's travel down the barrel. A few passes may be required (repeat until no copper particles are visible on the cloth, then do it once more).
 There is no advantage to adding gun oil down the barrel, and this increases the chance of buildup of dust and powder/copper/lead residue which can lead to jams and squibs (when a bullet gets caught in the barrel). Contrary to popular belief, oil does not neutralize solvent.
 This produces consistent results and ensures the solvents are neutral, while keeping your barrel dry for the first shot.
 The bore brush is not a required step for standard cleaning, but may be desired for a complete clean.

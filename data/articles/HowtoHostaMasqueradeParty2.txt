 Consider what theme you want so that you can inform your guests. For a masquerade party, you’ll need a fun theme that everyone can adhere to. This is also a fun element of the party that will help get your guests more engaged and excited ahead of time.You could include a color theme where everyone has to dress in the same colors (like black and white).
You could also choose a Mardi Gras theme for a more casual, relaxed party.
 Since it's a masquerade party, of course you're going to have to wear a mask. If you're a guy, pick out a tuxedo, dress pants, or something else dressy and a hand mask. If you're a lady, choose a fancy dress and a strap-on sparkly mask.Make sure you dress according to your chosen theme.
You can also include fun masquerade accessories like some flashy jewelry or heavy eye makeup (that can be seen while wearing your mask).
 The decorations make the party. Include little masquerade details everywhere – like candlesticks in elegant candleholders (used safely, of course), glitter on some of the tables, masks as centerpieces, etc.You could also hang some masks on the wall.
Consider draping dangly lights from the ceiling and using colorful fabric to cover up any out-of-place furniture.
 Classical music is a great choice for a masquerade party because it goes with the idea of revelry inherent in the masquerade party ideal. Choose music by Beethoven, Mozart, and Vivaldi.You can hire a band or just play songs on your stereo – whatever works.

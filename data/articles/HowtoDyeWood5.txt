 For the record, this isn't a very strong dye and is only suitable for light colored wood, such as pine. The end result will look "weathered.” Make sure it is as strong a brew as possible; the darker the coffee, the darker the dye effect.


Dyeing a dining room table that seats 14? You may need more than just a pot.
 These will be used as part of the dye, making it richer and deeper – and that translates to fewer coats for you to spread.


Before you go to dip your rag or paintbrush in the coffee, you may want to put on rubber or plastic gloves to keep coffee stains off your hands.
 While the coffee is still warm (not hot), use a paintbrush or rag dipped into the coffee and apply it to the wood. Rub or paint back and forth, across the wood.


Don't worry about the grounds; press them in if you can but just keep moving back and forth. Leave the grounds in place for darker dyeing.
 If you're working with a smaller object, arrange on paper towels or towels to dry. Some coffee may drip down the sides, depending on your process. This is generally fine, as it will give it a perfectly-imperfect look.
 After a few layers, the effect can be quite evident. Reheat the coffee until it's warm again to bring back its potency, and reapply.


Remember to let it dry before you apply another layer. It will be slightly darker when wet.
If you like the current shade, consider sealing it with polyurethane spray or a wood varnish. This will help the color last longer, give it a sheen, and protect it against the elements.

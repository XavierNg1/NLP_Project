 As an example, we’ll look at the carbon-14 isotope. Since the non-isotopic form of carbon-14 is simply carbon (C), find carbon on the periodic table (in the second row down).
 This tends to be the most visible number pertaining to a given element and usually sits above the element symbol. (On our example chart, in fact, no other numbers are listed.) The atomic number is the number of protons in a single atom of that element. C is number 6, meaning one atom of carbon has 6 protons.
 This is incredibly easy with isotopes, as they are named according to their atomic mass. Carbon-14, for example, has an atomic mass of 14. Once you find the atomic mass of the isotope, the process is the same as it is for finding the number of neutrons in a regular atom.
 Since the vast majority of an atom’s mass is found its protons and neutrons, subtracting the number of protons (i.e. the atomic number) from the atomic mass will give you the calculated number of neutrons in the atom. In our example, this is: 14 (atomic mass) – 6 (number of protons) = 8 (number of neutrons).
 To find the number of neutrons in the future, simply use this formula:



N = M – n

N = number of Neutrons
M = atomic Mass
n = atomic number

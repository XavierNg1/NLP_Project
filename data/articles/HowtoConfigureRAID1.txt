 There are a variety of RAID levels, each offering its own type of protection and security.


RAID 0 improves hard drive performance by splitting data over multiple hard drives, but offers no data protection.
RAID 1 writes the same data to multiple hard drives, protecting data against a hard drive failure.
RAID 5 offers improved performance and protection, but requires at least three hard drives.
Research the different types to find the one that best suits your needs.;

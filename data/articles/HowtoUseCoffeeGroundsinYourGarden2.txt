 Slugs and snails can chew up your most prized plants, but they are not fond of coffee grounds. Sprinkle a handful of grounds around the bases of plants you want to protect. If you're worried about increasing the acidity of the soil, make a solid ring of grounds farther away from the base.


It's thought that this works because the caffeine in the coffee grounds hurts these pests., Coffee grounds aren't just good for tiny pests. They can also be used to keep feline friends from playing in your delicate plants. In this case, use the grounds just as you'd use them to repel snails â€” sprinkle them around the plants you want to protect. The acidifying effect on the soil may be unavoidable here due to how much you'll need to use.
 If you participate in vermiculture (raising worms), you have a great opportunity to use up your coffee grounds. Worms love to eat coffee grounds, so feel free to add plenty to your worm bin or a worm-containing compost pile. Note, however, that coffee grounds should be part of a balanced diet: fruit and vegetable scraps, newspaper, leaves, and so on should accompany any coffee grounds you add., There is some evidence that coffee grounds can be used to prevent certain types of fungus from attacking your plants. A light sprinkling of coffee grounds may be able to prevent Fusarium, Pythium, and Sclerotinia species of fungi from taking root. Tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers are especially vulnerable to fungal infections, so coffee grounds make an especially good choice for these plants.

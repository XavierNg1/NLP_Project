 Heat up a mixture of vinegar and water for few minutes and wipe it with a towel for cleaning.
 Vinegar can effectively clean kitchen counter tops, stove tops, and the tops of refrigerators and other appliances. Spray undiluted vinegar over the surface of appliances and counters in your kitchen, then wipe away using paper towels or a soft, clean rag.
 Pour half a cup of white vinegar into the food processor bowl or blender jug. Add a quarter teaspoon of your usual dish washing detergent. Pour in warm water to near the top of the food processor bowl or blender jug. Place the processor or blender lid on and set aside. Leave for an hour or two. During this time, the vinegar will absorb the food odor from the plastic or glass. Tip the water and vinegar solution out. Wash the processor or blender as usual. Give it the sniff test; if it's odorless, you're good to go. If not, repeat but allow the soaking to occur for 8 to 12 hours, then rinse. That will usually be sufficient to remove the odor.
 Mix together 1 part salt with 4 parts vinegar, then moisten a rag with the solution. Use the rag to rub away built-up soap scum from bathroom and kitchen faucets.
 Place 2 cups of vinegar in the bottom of your dishwasher and run it on low, or the energy-saving setting. Halfway through, stop the dishwasher and let the vinegar soak on the bottom for 15 or 20 minutes. After the time is up, turn it back on to finish. If it's really bad, you can let it soak overnight. If smell is an issue, sprinkle 1/2 - 1 cup of baking soda around the bottom and run the washer as normal.
 Dilute it with water in a 1:1 ratio. Pour into the kettle and leave it in the kettle for 1 hour, without boiling. Tip it out after the soaking time. Rinse. Fully rinse the kettle with fresh water at least 5 times before using again.

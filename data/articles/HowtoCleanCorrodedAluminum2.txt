 Clean off dirt with a soft bristle brush. Try to remove all dust and large particles with the brush., Apply water and dishwashing detergent to a sponge. Use moderate pressure when wiping down the surface. Sometimes, this will be sufficient to remove oxidation., If detergent did not remove the oxidation, try a lemon. Cut the lemon in half and place salt on the inside. Then rub the surface down with the inside of the lemon, so that the salt and acid of the lemon can remove aluminum oxide. Rub gently because the salt is abrasive.Alternatively, you can apply lemon juice and salt to a rag and use the rag to gently rub the aluminum.
 For hard to remove oxidation, apply aluminum etching cleaner to stainless steel wool, grade 0000 to 000. Put on gloves and rub problem spots with the cleaner. Rub as gently as possible to remove corrosion., Do not allow detergent, lemon, or other cleaners to dry on the surface. Use another wet sponge, without detergent, to wipe it down, removing the soap.

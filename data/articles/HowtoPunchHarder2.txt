 Not so heavy that you have no more knuckles after your workout, but not so light that you blast the bag away with your first strike. It's one of those "Goldilocks And The Three Bears" situations: not too much, not too little, just right.
 Use the tips outlined above about how to improve your technique, and practice them on the punching bag. Remember to really put your hips into each punch.
 Don't use dumbbells that are challenging for you to lift. Start with 5 or 10 lbs, or perhaps 15 lbs if you lift weights regularly.
 Punching with dumbbells will increase your speed and shoulder endurance as well as building strength when you deliver the punch.


Start off by doing 12-15 reps of punches on one hand, and then switch to the other hand. Try to shoot for 10 sets on each hand; do this daily.






Remember to not overtrain your dominant hand at the expense of the other. If you have an obvious weakness in one hand, focus on training that hand. In a fight, a smart opponent will try to exploit your weak side. Not giving him an exploitation point will make you a stronger fighter.






Gradually increase the weight as you become accustomed to the lower weight. Increase your weight will make your arm-strength and speed increase without trying you will get knocked out.
Never punch a punching bag with dumbbell weights in your hand. Only air-jab with weights in your hand.

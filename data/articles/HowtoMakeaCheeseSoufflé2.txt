 Remove all top racks and have the rack at the lower part of the oven. Look at your soufflé dish and estimate its height twice over - the soufflé may rise this much so will need this much room in the oven.
It is preferable to cook the soufflé without the oven fan on as the fan can make the soufflé rise unevenly, overcook one side or even push the semi-cooked light batter over the side of the dish. If you have an oven thermometer, use that to ensure your oven is heating to the right temperature. If you serve the soufflé and it is undercooked and very runny in the middle, simply scoop out the cooked portions and serve those. Just like cakes, soufflés unfortunately don't rise again if you put them back in the oven to cook a little more.
 You want the top rim to be coated to prevent the souffle sticking and rising lopsided.
 Add the breadcrumbs to the dish and swirl to cover the base. Then tilt the dish and continue turning it to cover. Tip the dish slightly downwards to get the surplus out towards the sides.
 Beat the sauce again to ensure it is as smooth or "soft" as possible as that will make incorporating the egg whites much easier and make a more successful soufflé.
 You can use electric beaters on a low setting and the whites should form stiff peaks when you lift the whisk or beater out. If it flops quickly or forms a ribbon trail, keep beating a little longer.
 Using the spoon or the whisk stir gently to incorporate the whites, be gentle, but the first batch of whites is slightly "sacrificial" so they won't need to retain their light fluffiness.
 When well incorporated, fold in the remainder of the whites and fold through. Be more gentle on this batch.

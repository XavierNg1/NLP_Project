 The symptoms of a yeast infection include a thick “cottage cheese” like discharge, itching and irritation, and redness around the vulva and vagina. It is possible to get recurring yeast infections. Some women may get four or more yeast infections per year.Tell your doctor if you get frequent yeast infections. Your doctor may be able to determine an underlying cause and help you take appropriate preventative measures.
 Your doctor can diagnose your yeast infection to be sure that that is what you are dealing with. Your doctor may be able to tell that you have a yeast infection just by doing a vaginal examination, but if the cause of your condition is unclear, your doctor can examine a swab of your discharge under a microscope.
 A yeast infection is usually treated with an antifungal agent. Your doctor may either recommend that you take a single oral dose of Diflucan 2 gm orally, or nighty Diflucan or clotrimazole, which is available over the counter in most drugstores. All “azole” medications have similar safety and efficacy.Follow the package and/or your doctor’s instructions for use.
There are several types of over-the-counter yeast infection treatments available in one day, three day, or five day regimens, and they have all been shown to be safe and effective by the FDA.
Some options will require a prescription. For example, a single dose of Diflucan, requires a healthcare provider visit and a prescription.

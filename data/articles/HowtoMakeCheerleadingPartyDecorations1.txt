 This cheerleading tassel garland is the perfect way to turn an ordinary room into cheerleading party central. These garlands can be hung across the room, strung down a wall, hung around the porch or anywhere else you're holding the party.


You can make tassels in tiny proportions as well, to hang across the centerpiece of a buffet table, etc.;
, Choose the color or variety of colors that represent the team, or another relevant color.
 Fold it once horizontally and once vertically.
 Pull apart the new sheet, then place it on top of the other sheet, with both sheets' folded parts forming the top.
 Do this about 1/2 inch (1.2cm) from the top (the folded part of the tissue paper), as this section will not be cut.


When marking, only make small marks; do not draw all the way down as this will show on the fine tissue paper.
 Using either an X-acto knife or scissors, cut out each length to the 1/2 inch (1.2cm) mark. Do not cut any further, as there must be a gap between the cut and the folded edge.


To help keep the cuts straight, use a ruler to cut along.
 The middle section will be uncut and intact, with tassel pieces each side of the unfolded sheet.
 Keep rolling until all of the paper is in a roll, tassel pieces still out to the sides.
 Then, fold it in half to bring all of the tassels together. Glue the folded part together, for added strength; be sure to glue it as a loop, for threading on the garland string. When held by the folded portion, the tassels will all fall downward.
 Below the loop portion, glue or stick on a little piece of ribbon, Washi tape, lace or colorful paper to create a neat band. Choose the item that gets wrapped here in a color that matches the tassel.
 Then repeat as many times with other pieces of tissue paper as you need tassels.
 This forms the tassel garland.
 Tie onto hooks or tie on something high up, to decorate the room with the tassels garland.

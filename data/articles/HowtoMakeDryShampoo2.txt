 Add 1 cup of bentonite clay, and 1 cup of arrowroot powder in a medium sized bowl.Use a spoon to mix the ingredients together until they are fully combined.
 Once the powdered ingredients are mixed, add in 5-10 drops of an essential oil of your choice. Mix the ingredients again to combine the essential oil with the powdered ingredients. The more drops of essential oil you add, the stronger smelling your dry shampoo will be.


This step isnâ€™t mandatory for making a dry shampoo, but it lends a nice fragrance to your homemade product.
Peppermint, lavender, and chamomile are popular choices for essential oil additions to dry shampoos.
 Use a funnel to add the dry shampoo into your chosen dry shampoo container. A container that resembles a salt or pepper shaker works best for storing your dry shampoo. However, make sure if you use a salt or pepper shaker, that it is either unused or thoroughly cleaned with soap and water. #*Make sure the container is completely dried before you add in your dry shampoo.


The tiny holes in the cap of a salt or pepper shaker allow for added control when you sprinkle the dry shampoo onto the roots of your hair.
 Tightly fasten on the top of the container, and enjoy your homemade dry shampoo. Be sure to look for any possible gaps between the container and its top, so you don't spill your dry shampoo when you're shaking it over your head.

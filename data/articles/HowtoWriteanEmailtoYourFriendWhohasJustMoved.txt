 You should also ask whether everything is alright: how he/she feels and if the trip to Germany was safe.;
, Tell him/her about mutual friends and the school building in general. Sometimes it's very interesting and nostalgic to hear about things you used to know so well and that you can't see now everyday.
 Also, if there's anything you always wanted to know about Germany, you can ask (e.g. I heard German food is amazing? Have you tried it yet? Or maybe German beer...).
 Do you plan on visiting your friend in Germany? If that's the case then you should tell him/her, unless it's a surprise . Tell him/her how excited you are about coming to Germany and to see him/her back. If you're not going to visit him/her then you should tell him/her how much you miss him/her. But don't exaggerate! Your friend has moved away and it's hard enough having to find new friends in another town in a whole new country. You should try to leave him/her enough space to let him/her find her way.

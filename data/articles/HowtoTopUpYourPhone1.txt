 You’ll need the unique card number to load the valued of the top-up card to your phone. The card number will either be on the receipt the store gives to you after payment or on the back of the card, in which you have to scratch off the grayed area to view it.
 You’ll have to call a specific number (depending on your service provider) displayed at the back of the card and enter the card number to top up the value to your phone.

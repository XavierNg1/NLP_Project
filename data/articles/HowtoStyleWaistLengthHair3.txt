 Using your fingers, gather the top half of your hair. Place both index fingers at your temples, then run them upward, toward the crown of your head until they meet at the top. Gather this hair together in one hand.


Avoid running your fingers directly across the back of your head from the temples. This will create an uneven split, putting most of your hair in the ponytail and only leaving a small portion on the bottom.
 Wrap a rubber band around the hair you have gathered near the crown of your head. Wrap the rubber band until you feel it is secure. On the final wrap, pull most of the ponytail through, but leave the end in the rubber band, holding it in a large loop.
 Grab the hair closest to the rubber band between your thumb and forefinger. Using equal pressure on both sides, gently pull outward, putting pressure on the rubber band and forcing it closer to your scalp.


You should feel the gathered hair tightening toward your scalp.
Pull the hair in your half ponytail outward to give it more volume and shape.
If some of your hair falls out of the rubber band, you will need to take the ponytail out and wrap it all again with the rubber band.
 Wrapping the top half of your hair into a loop leaves the bottom half free and long. Get the rest of your hair out of the way or mix up the style by repeating the half ponytail with the bottom half of your hair giving you two loops in the back, one above the other.


Start the bottom ponytail underneath the top loop to hide the rubber band and create a stacked effect.
Consider decorating with stylish hair pins between the two loops.

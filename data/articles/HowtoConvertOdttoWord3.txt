 All Google accounts, including Gmail accounts, come with access to Google Drive. You can use this service to store your files, but it also works as a handy file converter.


You can log into Google Drive at drive.google.com


, You can quickly do this by dragging and dropping the file into your browser window when you're logged into Drive. You can also click the "New" button and select "File upload".
 This will open it in the Google Drive document reader.
 This will convert the file to Google Docs format and open it in the Google Docs editor.
 This will download the file to your Downloads folder in .docx format.


If your version of Word cannot open .docx files, click here.

 Before actually meeting strangers or people in other departments at the gathering, consider how you’ll introduce yourself and describe your profession. Choose a brief, compelling description, but try not to rattle it off and make it sound rehearsed.For example, if you are launching a startup company, avoid saying something like, “I work from home and I’m trying to get this company off the ground, but seem to have constant trouble.” The people you meet will likely interpret this as a lack of success.
Say something like, “I’m an entrepreneur and have just designed this exciting new product. It’s been a real adventure!”;
, Think of realistic goals that you can check off, like meeting three new people or introducing yourself to at least one senior officer you didn’t already know. Try not to set unreachable goals, like securing a definite promotion or getting new investors for your product or service., Think about who will be attending the party, and if you don’t already know, find out the guest list if possible. Ask a mutual acquaintance who’s either hosting the party or will be there to introduce you to someone.Say something like, “Hey, I know you invited Jim, the senior V.P. of product development, to your party tomorrow evening. Any chance you could introduce us if you have a chance? I’d love to have a chat with him about a design I’ve been working on.”

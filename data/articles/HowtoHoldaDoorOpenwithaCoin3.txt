 You want to be careful when propping doors open if you live with young children. A door could swing open and closed fast if a child fell or pushed on it. This could cause injury. If you need to prop a door open, do so only when your children are secured elsewhere., If you have pets, do not leave a door propped open unless you're supervising them. A larger dog could push a propped door open and get loose. Make sure to secure animals in another room before propping a door open with a coin.
 A heavier door will be unlikely to be propped open by a coin. The force of a heavy door can easily dislodge a coin doorstop, even one that is carefully taped down. If you need to hold open a larger door, use a bigger object like a chair or cinderblock. You can also purchase a door stop at a local hardware store.

 To make your nose look longer, you should begin shading the contour lines at the curve of the brow bone, then work all the way down to the tip. Using an angled brush, follow the curve of the brow bone to the top of your nose, then continue in a straight line all the way to the end. Repeat on the other side.









The line at the brow bone should begin just underneath your eyebrow.
Always work from the top to the bottom, as you want the line to be darkest at the brow bone.
 To make your nose appear longer, you should apply highlighter all the way down the bridge of your nose, right to the tip. But most importantly, you should extend the highlighter up between your brows, until it's parallel with the highest point (usually the arch) of your eyebrows.

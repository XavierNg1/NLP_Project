 Never keep your iPhone constantly charged, the best thing to do is keep the battery running at about 50% - 80%, as overcharging will do gradual damage to your iPhone battery.
 Avoid constantly using your iPhone to play games or watch videos especially when the temperature of the environment is high. And keeping your iPhone too hot by constant charging can also cause power-lose every year.
 You can also try turning off Location Services (under Privacy), which should affect multiple apps, and turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth service will help you save precious battery life.

 Coat each pork chop generously with the rub, place them in a plastic resealable bag, and refrigerate for 4-6 hours.
 Remove the chops from the plastic bag and let them sit at room temperature, covered, for about 20 minutes.
 Grill each pork chop for 18-20 minutes, turning them over halfway through.









The chops should have grill marks and be only slightly pink at the center when finished.
 Serve immediately and enjoy!

 You will need to buy the phone using your own private funds, and your purchase should be untraceable by your parental overseers. If you have a privately-owned bank/savings account that isn't looked at too closely – use it! However, if your parents monitor your spending, then you may need to be more subtle. Remove small amounts from the bank, and do so only sporadically.


If you don't have enough money, consider asking someone to help you out. Try asking grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins and older siblings – trustworthy adults who won't tell your parents. If possible, don't tell them that it's for a phone.;
, If you don't have a source of steady income, you'll need to find a way to get cash. If you have a job, try saving a little bit each month until you have enough to afford a phone and a phone plan. If you don't have a job, try getting a part-time job at a local shop; consider working odd jobs around your neighborhood.


Store your cash in a secret place: under a mattress or in a piggy-bank. Your parents might not care about you saving up – but it will be easier to keep the phone a secret if you don't need to answer questions about what you're saving for.
 If you need a cell phone to prevent a domestic violence situation within the home, Social Services may be able to help you either source a phone or provide parental counseling. If, however, all you want is to be able to text or call your friends without supervision, there may be other options – including online chat services such as Skype or Google's "Hangouts."


If you want the mobility of a phone, an iPod touch or a similar Internet-connecting device could be used in areas where WiFi is available. Buy an iPod touch on either eBay or the Apple Store.

 Before you polish your nails, apply a base coat to fill in any holes or ridges. This will provide a smooth bed for the actual nail polish and help your manicure last longer. You can also use a protective or strengthening base coat to keep your nails healthy and strong.


Apply a thin coat to each nail, just enough to cover it without any excess. Let it dry completely before you move on to the next step.;
, Use any color you like, but bright, vibrant colors tend to work particularly well. Apply one coat of this nail polish, being careful not to use too much, and let it dry before moving on.
 You'll need a tool to use to add the polka dots. Toothpicks work perfectly, but pencils, skewers, or anything similarly round and thin will also work well. If you're using a toothpick or something that tapers to a sharp point, this could poke holes in your nail polish or make the polka dots too small. To avoid this, rub it against a flat surface to dull it down and give it a round, flat base that will make for better polka dots.
 Choose a nail polish in a color that complements the base you used. For instance, a bright blue or pink base goes perfectly with white polka dots. Pour out a little bit of this nail polish onto a small sheet of saran wrap - this will give you more control over exactly how much you use. Dip your flattened toothpick or other dotting implement into the polish and then dot it onto your nails. Use approximately the same number of dots for each nail, and put some dots halfway off your nail for a cute effect.


Use minimal amounts of polish when dotting to keep your polka dots small and uniformly sized.
 This will cover the whole nail in a protective layer to keep your polka dots looking bright and fresh for much longer. However, make sure to do this only when all your nail polish is completely dry - otherwise, you risk smearing your polka dots and mixing colors unpleasantly.

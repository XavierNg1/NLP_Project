 Going to the store without a list is like going into battle without a plan: you’ll end up browsing the aisles, buying things you don’t need, and skipping things you do. Improve your chances of success by mapping out your grocery trip ahead of time, listing all of the essentials for the week—for example, meat, dairy, and produce—as well as any snacks, non-grocery items such as toilet paper or toothpaste, and beverages.If you’re having trouble figuring out what you’ll need for the week, try creating a meal plan for the week and then listing the ingredients needed for each meal.
There are many mobile apps, such as BagIQ and GroceryPal, which can assist in list-making.;
, While you want the majority of your cart to be taken up by essential meal components, you should also keep some ready-made, healthy nibbles handy. Putting these diet-friendly foods, such as kale chips or shelled nuts, on your list will ensure that you have some snack options when you’re peckish without deviating from your basic, healthy plan.


If you don’t trust yourself to opt for healthy snacks while in the store, sign up for a subscription box, such as Naturebox or Graze, that does your health-homework for you and sends delicious snacks right to your door., Not only should you plan what you want to buy at the store, but you should also set a schedule for when and how often you’ll go shopping. If you don’t do this, you’ll find you go to the grocery store more frequently, stopping in to buy ingredients or snacks on an ad hoc basis rather than consolidating your purchases in a single, weekly trip.Weekly trips might be insufficient to keep fresh fruit and veggies stocked in your house, so allow yourself semi-weekly trips to the produce market.
 Everyone has a few unhealthy foods they find particularly difficult to resist. Rather than pretending these items don’t exist when planning your grocery trip, it can help to draw up a special ‘no-no’ or ‘don’t buy’ list. By doing so, you’re being honest with yourself about your particular weaknesses and making it an explicit priority to conquer them.For example, include potato chips, high-sugar cold cereals, candy bars, and pre-packaged baked goods on your ‘don’t buy’ list.

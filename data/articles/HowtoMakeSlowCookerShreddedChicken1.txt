 Add the chicken, liquid, and a dash of salt and pepper to the slow cooker. It's best to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, but you can really use any cut. You can scale this recipe up, too, as long as you keep the ratio of chicken to liquid the same.You can also add any seasoning you like, such as a dash of garlic powder or a sprinkle of seasoned salt.;
, Set the slow cooker to high or low, and leave the chicken to cook. It will take three to four hours on high or five to six hours on low. You can cook chicken from frozen, but keep in mind it will take longer for the chicken to cook., Take the chicken out of the slow cooker while it is still warm, as it is easiest to shred then. Put it on a plate and use two forks to shred the chicken into pieces. It should be tender enough to shred easily.If you didn't use a boneless, skinless cut of meat, take off the skin and bones.

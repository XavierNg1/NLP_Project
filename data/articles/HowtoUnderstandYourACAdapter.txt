 AC Adapter stands for Alternating Current adapter.;
, Essentially, an AC adapter separates the power supply from the main body of your electric device; it facilitates the operation of electronic circuits.
 In lay man's terms, the AC adapter is the thing that plugs into both your wall and your laptop so you can surf the net. It’s a type of power supply. They are often referred to as plug packs, plug-in adapters, and power adapters. By separating the power supply from the electric device, the power supply can be lighter and more compact.
 The wall plug side of the AC adapter tends to be large and can block other power points from being available. You can fix that problem easily: purchase a power strip and give yourself more room to plug in!

, As with any electronic device, these adapters don’t last forever. Be aware that your laptop, or other device, not charging might not always be a problem with the battery. There are replacements AC adapters available, even at discount prices, so never fear.

 Removing paint will create a huge mess on the floor. You should place something like a drop cloth on the ground. Then, when you are done, you can fold up the drop cloth, pick it up, and toss the excess paint into the trash., If parts of the paint are already loose or falling off, get a putty knife underneath the paint and simply begin scraping the paint away. Use the flat edge of the scrapper so as not to damage the plaster.If you do damage the plaster, fill in the area with joint compound.
 For small chunks that you cannot pick up by scraping, use sandpaper. Rub the sandpaper over the surface to pick up the paint., Chemical strippers can discolor your wall if left on too long. However, if the paint on your wall is not sufficiently loose to scrape up on its own, you might need to use a stripper. Dip a paintbrush in the stripper and then rub the paintbrush over a section of the wall. Let the stripper sit for five minutes. Then, use a putty knife to scrape away with paint.Repeat this process until you have cleaned the wall. Ideally, once you have scrapped off a portion of the paint, you will be able to use the putty knife to remove the rest, without using a chemical stripper.
 After you have removed the paint, rub the entire wall down with sponge soaked in cool, clean water. This is step is especially important if you have used chemical stripper. If it stays on the wall, it can do damage to the surface.

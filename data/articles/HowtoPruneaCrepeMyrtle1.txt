 To prune a mature crepe myrtle, you're going to need a few different types of pruning tools. Gather the following supplies from your garage or a hardware store before you get started:


A hand pruner, for pruning small twigs and thin branches.
Loppers, which are used to cut thicker branches that are higher up.
Pole pruners, which cut even thicker branches.
A pruning saw, for the thickest branches you need to cut.;
, Plan to prune in late winter or early spring for the best summer blooms. Pruning before leaves sprout on the tree is also helpful because you get a clearer view of which branches to cut. You can remove flowers when they fade in the summer to encourage a second bloom.
 To keep a crepe myrtle healthy and beautiful, you want to prune with an eye toward opening up the middle of the tree to allow air to flow through more easily. Don't over-prune by lopping the trunks close to the ground. Aside from those guidelines, you can prune your crepe myrtle to a shape and size that works for your yard.


Crepe myrtles can grow about 1 to 2 feet (30-40 cm) per season, so prune based on your desired tree height. For example, if you want your tree to be about 6 feet (2 m) tall, you will want to prune back to 4 to 5 feet (121 cm to 166 cm).
Keep in mind that new growth will sprout from the pruned areas.

 You won't be baking these cookies, but you still will need some place to put them. You can also line a cupcake tin with paper cupcake liners. Each cupcake liner will hold one drop of cookie dough.


Consider storing the baking sheet in the refrigerator while you are making the dough. This will make it cold, and allow the cookies to finish sooner.;
, Mix the ingredients together with a spoon or spatula. Be sure to cut the butter into smaller cubes before adding it into the pot. This will help it melt faster.


If you are allergic to milk, consider using almond milk, coconut milk, soy milk, or lactose-free milk.
Add Â¼ teaspoon of salt to cut down on sweetness. The salt will also help bring out the other flavors.Add it into the cooking pot before the butter starts to melt, and stir it in well.
 Keep stirring the cookie dough so it does not burn. Wait until the butter melts. This will take about three minutes.
 Be sure to use quick-cooking oats. Stir the oats into the dough with a spoon or a spatula. Keep stirring until the oats are evenly coated.
 Scoop some of the dough out using a tablespoon, then drop it onto the wax paper. The dough will be shaped like clumpy balls. If you want, you can flatten the clumps by pressing down on them with the back of the spoon.


Try making some cookie balls instead. Roll the dough into small balls first, then roll the balls around in a bowl filled with shredded coconut, crushed nut, or cocoa powder.
, If you are in a hurry, you can put the cookies into the freezer for about 15 minutes., If you serve them too soon, they will start to melt and fall apart.

 You can usually easily remove the skin from a cooked chicken by hand, but that means it’s important to ensure that it’s not too hot to handle. That way, you won’t burn yourself. After you’ve finished cooking the chicken, let it sit for approximately 10 minutes.You’ll know that the chicken is cool enough when you can touch it without discomfort.
To ensure that the chicken retains enough heat to eat, you may want to set a piece of foil over it as it cools.
 Cooking the chicken actually helps loosen the skin from the meat, so there may be an edge that you can easily grab hold of without much effort. However, in some cases, the skin may not be loose enough for you to grasp, so you’ll need to take a knife and gently slide it between the skin and meat. When the skin lifts up, grab it between your fingers.It’s usually best to cut the cooked chicken into pieces before you start to remove the skin.
 Chicken skin typically becomes crispy when you cook it, so in most cases, it’s easier to peel it off after it’s cooked. Pull the skin from one side of the chicken to the other to remove it. It probably will not peel off in one clean piece, so you may need to repeat the process a few times to remove all of the skin.Leaving the skin on the chicken while it cooks can actually help keep the meat tender and juicy. Removing the skin prior to eating, though, gives you much of the same health benefits as skinning the chicken before you cook it.

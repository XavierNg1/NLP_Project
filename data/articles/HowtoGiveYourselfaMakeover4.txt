 Bring all your clothes out into the open so you can take stock of what you own. Mix and match pieces together in combinations that you don’t normally do. Take pictures of combinations that you like so that you can recreate them later.


Get rid of clothes that don’t fit or that you never wear.
 A clothing swap is a party where everyone brings a few items of clothing and accessories to give away. Invite several friends to bring clothes that they’d like to get rid of. This is a good way to freshen up your wardrobe and to mix-and-match your friends’ different styles., If you are finding yourself buying the same types of clothes all the time, think about where you’re getting your clothes. If you always frequent the same store, then your style won’t necessarily change. Visit a few new shops to check out other styles.
 Most people wear jeans at least some of the time. They’re comfortable and easy and they match just about everything. But they can also get you into a slump with your overall look. Try going a week without wearing jeans. Try skirts, sundresses, or slacks instead to dress up your look., Many women wear the wrong size of bra, and consequently, clothes don’t always fit or look the way they should. Go to a department store or lingerie store and ask the sales clerk to measure you for a bra. You might find that you are more comfortable and confident when you wear the correct size.

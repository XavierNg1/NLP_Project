 Dr. Seuss's "The Lorax" and "The Butter Battle Book" explain political conflict in a conceptual way. Other children’s books like “Around America to Win the Vote: Two Suffragists, a Kitten, and 10,000 Miles” talk about the fight for women’s suffrage in America.


You can also find movies and television shows to watch with your children.
Be sure to include race in discussions of politics, particularly around suffrage. For instance, though U.S. women were granted the right to vote in 1919, women of color were not.;
, News sources like HTE Kids News, Time for Kids, and Scholastic Kids Press Corps can help educate your young children about politics.. These websites discuss the news in age appropriate ways and avoid topics or subjects that you might not want them to learn about.Read an article to them and ask them to tell you what they learned.
 Your teenager will have more information about the politics of the day than a younger child will. They are constantly being bombarded by political messages on social media. Find out what they know and believe about candidates, politicians and various political issues. This will help you figure out their political leanings and assess how deeply to engage in conversation initially.For instance, you might say “So Micah, what have you heard about the recent travel ban in America? And what do you think about it?”

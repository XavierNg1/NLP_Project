 Make a refreshing summer appetizer halfway between salsa and fruit salad, by chopping and adding half a sweet apple and half a pear instead of the onion and garlic. This pairs well with a handful of chopped mint instead of cilantro.


1⁄4 cup (60 mL) crushed pineapple can be added to this recipe or to the basic recipe for a more tropical, acidic flavor.
 Your favorite fresh vegetables make your salsa distinctive in color and flavor. Options include bell pepper (any color), avocado, cucumber, or walnuts. Mince finely and combine with the basic ingredients.


Leave the avocado out until just before serving, to avoid browning.
 Instead of the typical Mexican blend of chile pepper, cilantro, and garlic, try one of these substitutions for a more unique take on the salsa:


Fry a small handful of fennel seeds in a tablespoon (15 mL) of olive oil, until browned. Add the chopped mango and chile pepper along with ½ teaspoon each (2.5 mL) of cumin, coriander, and ginger powder. Cook until the oil separates, then combine with the other fruits and vegetables or serve plain.

Or try 1 teaspoon (5 mL) white vinegar, 3 teaspoons (15 mL) olive oil, and a brief grind of white pepper.

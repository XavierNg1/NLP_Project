 The best way to work with adults is to respect the fact that they're essentially your equal once you leave the classroom. Try to assert the kind of image that allows them to respect your outside of the classroom, too.;
, Set expectations on day one and hold all students accountable for their actions. Make no exceptions for the first couple of meetings, too. Own your class and control the direction it goes in, you will find that the students will choose to follow or to leave. Luckily, they are adults, and you do not have to put up with their displeasure. If they don't behave appropriately, YOU have every right to ask them to leave.
 If they stumble and don't perform to your expectations, give them fair and honest grades. If they come to you seeking help, assist them in identifying their specific problem areas and provide resources that the student can use to improve their skills. That is just plain good teaching and it works for all students at all ages.
 Be the kind of teacher that is interesting and fun. Don't be so by-the-book that the students find you dry, but don't be wild and unpredictable. Maintain strictly professional relationships with students, but feel free to loosen your tie, or let down your hair, when the occasion calls for it. They are adults. You're not their role model, though you might be their mentor.

 You can shrink sections of a sweater, like the neck or sleeves, if only these areas are stretched out. To do so, boil a medium-sized pot of water. Then, pour this water into a bowl., You can dip the sleeves, cuffs, or neck of the sweater into the water. Use protective gloves if the water is still steaming. You do not want to get burnt in the process., Using your fingers, gently pinch and squeeze the portion of the sweater you're shrinking. Work the sweater until it's at your desired size and shape.If you're remolding the cuff of a sweater sleeve, it might be a good idea to hold the cuff chest level as you remold. As the cuff is small, pulling it closer will allow you to see what you're doing.When remolding a larger area, like the neck of a sweater, try laying the sweater down on a flat surface as you work.
If your sweater is very wet, you may want to remold it over a towel to catch any drips.
 When you've reshaped the sweater, take a hairdryer and blow the sweater dry. The hot air works in combination with the hot water to solidify the new shape, shrinking that portion of sweater back to its original size.As the method requires hot air to work, you do not want to use the cool setting on your hair dryer. Start with the low heat setting. If the sweater is not drying fast enough, consider switching to high heat.

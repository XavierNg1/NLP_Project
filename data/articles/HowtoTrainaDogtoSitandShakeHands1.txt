 Be sure to bring a pocketful of treats with you.;
,, Hold it above your dog's nose. Most dogs will automatically lower their back end at this point.



If your dog sits, praise them extensively and give them the treat.






If your dog cranes its neck or jumps instead of sitting, put the treat back in your pocket. Then, try again, this time using your hand to push your dog's back end into the sitting position. Be sure to say SIT as your dog is sitting. Once they are sitting, give praise and reward them with the treat.
 Then, take a break.
 Continue this pattern until the dog sits consistently. Then, slowly scale back on the treats until you are giving only praise as a reward.

 Ferrets are chewers, but the material has to be right. Very sturdy dog toys can be good for ferrets, but not the soft rubbery toys. Ferrets will chew up and might swallow soft toys. Kongs are suitable for ferrets.
 Pet stores sell sticks and other items made just for ferrets to chew. Most ferrets love these, but typically will eat them, so they are not a long-term chewing toy.
 Sturdy ropes made for dogs can be enjoyed by ferrets. Some ferrets like to play tug-of-war with these ropes just like a dog.

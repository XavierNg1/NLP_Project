 Though it may be tempting to wear Uggs barefoot, the sweat and bacteria on your feet will shorten the lifespan of your boots. Perspiration and bacteria get into the wool lining, damaging the boots and creating an unfriendly odor. Wearing socks will keep your boots looking and smelling fresh for longer.If you do get an unwanted odor, try sprinkling some baking powder into your Uggs and let sit overnight. Baking powder kills bacteria and removes bad smells. Even if your boots don’t have a particularly pungent odor, putting some baking powder in the lining over the summer will keep them fresh for next season., Classic Uggs are, unfortunately, not waterproof. Wearing your boots in the rain or snow will inevitably lead to the formation of bacteria, which causes bad odor. If you’re dying to wear your Uggs in wet weather, make sure to buy a waterproofing spray to protect your boots.
 If your boots become stained or water damaged, use a leather or suede shampoo that you can pick up from your local pharmacy. Scrub your boots down and let sit overnight. Stuff with newspaper to help with drying and to retain shape. Be aware that some shampoos lightly change the color of your boots, but will leave them looking good as new.If you have a particularly nasty grease or oil stain, sprinkle with talcum powder, cornstarch, or chalk and let sit overnight.
If you have a harder stain, such as wine or marker, try spraying a little hairspray on the trouble spot and let sit for a few hours. Then coat with a bit of dish soap and allow to dry. You can repeat this process as many times as necessary until the stain is gone.

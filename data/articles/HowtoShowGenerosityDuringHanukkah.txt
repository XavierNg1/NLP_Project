 Customarily, parents give presents to their children on Hanukkah, but try outreaching beyond those you know. You could host a Hanukkah toy drive to buy gifts for less fortunate children, or along those lines.;
, You could make an individual donation or get your family, friends, coworkers, etc. involved.
 You can make Hanukkah staples such as latkes (potato pancakes) with sour cream and applesauce; or sufganiyot (Israeli jelly donuts) and partner with an organization to facilitate delivery of the meals.
 This could be a synagogue for example, which often hold holiday fairs or fundraisers around this time.

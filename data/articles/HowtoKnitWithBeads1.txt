If the yarn is too thick to thread through a needle that will fit through the beads, your beads might be too small for the yarn. Try this before you give up; poke the end of the yarn through a wire needle threader, then thread the beads onto the needle threader and pull them down onto the strand of yarn.
Allow the beads to collect against the skein of yarn until you need one.;
, Knit the stitch before the bead, draw the bead up against the just-completed stitch, then knit the next stitch firmly.


Knitting the stitches to each side of the bead firmly helps hold the bead in place.
If you want the bead to show on the front or "right" side of your work, place it between purl stitches. In other words, purl the stitch before you slip the bead up against your work, then purl the next stitch as well, no matter what the pattern says.
If you want the bead to show on the back or "wrong" side of your work, place it between knit stitches.



If you run out of beads before you run out of yarn, cut the yarn, thread more beads onto the new working yarn, then join the 2 ends of yarn and continue knitting.

Many times students will act out or misbehave due to the fact that they are overwhelmed by how much work they have to do. What this strategy suggests is breaking up what you want students to do/learn into more manageable chunks. In between each chunk give the students a little break. The source here calls these breaks, fun breaks. These fun breaks can be as simple as having students jump up and down for a minute or two. Giving students breaks can also encourage them to act accordingly and work hard so that they can be rewarded with fun breaks.;
, This strategy can help to reduce behaviors due to these wants of students. What this strategy suggests is giving students the option of choosing something for themselves. For example, you can give students the chance to decide where they want to sit, who they want to work with, what activity they want to do first, and so on. This gives students the feeling of having attention because it is what they are choosing to do, but it also gets things done.
 This could be something as simple as not knowing they were going to watch an educational movie or that they would be working on addition in math. These surprises can cause students to be overwhelmed or have anxiety. Something teachers can do to prevent these behaviors and feelings is to let students know what they will be doing for the day.
 This can help students to prepare for what they will be doing and could help them to be less overwhelmed.



Many times students misbehave due to the fact of who they are sitting by or how the classroom is set up. Something as simple as rearranging the classroom or the seating chart can prevent misbehavior.

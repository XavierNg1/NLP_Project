 You can tell you're in Darnassus when you're surrounded by trees and everything looks purple. Directly west of the bank, the big hollow tree shaped like a cat, is a tree with a glowy pink-ness to it. Enter that glowy pinkness. This will teleport you to Rut'theran Village.;
, This dock will send you to Stormwind Harbor. Wait for the boat to come if it is not already present.
 After a minute the boat will take off! You will see a map tracking your journey to the Eastern Kingdoms. Tada, you're in Stormwind! Wait for the boat to dock, and step off of the boat. From here, do whatever it was you began the journey for in the first place.

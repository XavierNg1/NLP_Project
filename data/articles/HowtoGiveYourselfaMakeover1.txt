 Take a look at yourself and decide what you want to change. What do you like about your look? What do you want to change?;
, Look online (Pinterest is a good site) or in magazines to find pictures of people that you like. Compile a folder of pictures. Look for certain elements that you like. Maybe you like the shoes in one picture and skirt in another picture. Cut them both out or save them to your computer.


Organize your pictures into different batches. Have a “makeup” batch, a “hairstyle” batch, a “clothes” batch and an “accessories” batch.
Look for recurring themes in the pictures you gather. As you assemble pictures, you’ll find that you keep centering around certain aspects or looks.
 Have a heart-to-heart with your best friend and ask for honest feedback about your look. Don’t make it seem like you’re fishing around for compliments, but that you honestly want to dress more smartly or wear your hair more stylishly.


If you ask for honest feedback, then expect honest feedback. Don’t take it personally or get offended if your friend tells you something you don’t like to hear.
 A new look might be quite a bit different than what people expect you to look like. Be brave about trying out a new look. It might suit you really well and you might feel more comfortable in your new look.


If you are concerned about trying out a wild look, try dressing up in that style for Halloween. Then, after the holiday, keep dressing like that, saying that you loved it so much you wanted to keep wearing that style.
 Get a photo of yourself in your “before” state, so that you can compare yourself to how you look after your makeover.

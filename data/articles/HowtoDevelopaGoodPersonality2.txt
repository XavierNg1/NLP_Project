 Many bad personalities develop because people do not want to forgive each other and find themselves overwhelmed with hate and anger. Try to find love for everyone.
 Being an inquisitive person is part about caring for other people, and it will also make you a more interesting person in turn. Try to find out what others find interesting and important. You’ll learn a lot and you’ll help them feel valued.
 Don’t betray those who are close to you. Your loved ones will appreciate you more and more if you remain loyal. Stick with the people you love through thick and thin. You can push through a rocky part in your relationship if you remain loyal to the person.
 Don’t try to act like you know everything, but always try to offer a helping hand to people when possible. This could be something as simple as helping a friend move out of their house or more involved support like life guidance. Offer whatever insight you may have but don’t try to sway them too far in one direction. Respect people’s decisions and opinions.

 Yarn is made up of strands, which are twisted together to form plies. Working with plied yarn is especially helpful when you’re working on cable and stitch patterns. If you’re looking to make your stitches stand out, use a smooth, plied yarn in a solid color.The thickness of yarn is determined not by how many plies you have, but how thick the individual plies are. For example, a 4-ply yarn can be thinner than a 1-ply yarn, provided the plies in the 1-ply yarn are finer than in the 4-ply.
If you’re working with a wide yarn, choose a simple pattern.
 Working with colored yarn can be counterintuitive: the more colorful your yarn, the simpler your stitching should be. Bright or novelty colors can distract or hide complicated work, so consider this when you’re picking a colored yarn to work with your pattern.Choose a plain, solid yarn to make the texture and shape of your project pop.
If you’re working with Fair Isle patterns, choose smooth plied yarns in contrasting colors so your patterns will show up.
Consider using hand painted yarn for a subtle watercolor technique.
If you’re a beginner, steer clear of novelty yarns. The yarn is harder to see and it makes fixing mistakes or ripping out stitches much more difficult.
 Certain yarns lack elasticity, which might not work with the pattern you’re hoping to use. Either pick a pattern that hangs straight, or ask a specialty store employee for elastic thread to help edge your pattern.Cotton and silk yarns both have very low elasticity.

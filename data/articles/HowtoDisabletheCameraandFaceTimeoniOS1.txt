 This will launch the Settings menu of your device.;
, Tap “General” from the Settings menu, and then tap on “Restrictions.” You will be brought to the Restrictions settings screen. Tap the “Enable Restrictions” button to enable restrictions on your device.
 To protect the restrictions you will be setting, you have to lock them via a passcode. A “Set Passcode” screen will appear. Enter a four-digit passcode by tapping on the number pad, and then re-enter it to confirm.


This passcode will be needed to make future changes to your restrictions. Make this something difficult for others to guess.
 Still on the same Restrictions setting screen, look for “Camera” under the Allow section. You will notice that its toggle button is green, signifying that it’s enabled. Tap on the toggle button to disable the Camera.
 Since FaceTime needs your device’s camera to function, turning off the camera will also mean turning off FaceTime. You will receive an information message about this. Tap the “OK” button on the message, and both Camera and FaceTime will be disabled together.

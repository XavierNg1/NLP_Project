 Most people only glance at a piece of art. For example, a survey done at the Louvre found that the average person spends 15 seconds looking at the Mona Lisa. This is not enough time to truly engage with a work of art. Try to spend at least a minute, preferably longer, looking at a piece of art. This will allow you to take in the image, look at the detail of the composition, and determine how you feel about the piece. By spending time looking at art, you will more likely be able to talk about the piece and some of the finer details.If you are able to stare at a work of art for long periods of time, you may begin to create a dialogue with the piece. This can be extremely interesting, as you begin to see how the picture speaks to you.
 Art galleries and museums will often place a small plaque near each piece to give the title and a small description. This can sometimes provide you with details to help you interpret and discuss the art. For example, you may see a knot of light pink lines and feel confused. Upon reading the plaque you learn that the title of the work is “My Struggle with Breast Cancer.” The title of this piece may help you better understand what is being communicated through the art.


Plaques can also include detailed information about the materials used, date that it was created, etc.
 Some galleries will also provide detailed information about the artists. This material may be found in a pamphlet or in a small biography near the artwork. Learning about the artist may help you understand a bit about their interests and what inspired them to create this art. This will give you more to discuss about the art.

 If you want to keep him/her, that's fine, and you needn't follow the pointers below. If you want to sell your horse for equus, then follow the pointers below.


Choose a rare coat and breed for your first horse. It doesn't necessarily have to be a horse or pony breed that you like, because to make money you'll be selling him.
Do as much games as you can with your foal to make him gain more genetic potential.
When you get a pass that you aren't using on something else, give your first horse a GA (Golden Apple) coat, preferably one that's not very popular, but still very pretty (so that when the coat gets retired, it will sell for more).
Add any BM (Black Market) items that you can to your horse, especially Morpheus Arms, Philotes Stroke, Pluto's Parchment, and any other BM items that would be a plus to the owner.
Fully finish training (and blupping your horse if possible), and then put him in the sales (either auction or private) for a good price. Remember, people on Howrse will pay tons for a horse with a Philosophers Stone (which your first horse gets anyway if you let Ow guide you) and a retired GA coat. Also, note that if no one bids on your horse, you can always put him back in the sales for a cheaper price.;

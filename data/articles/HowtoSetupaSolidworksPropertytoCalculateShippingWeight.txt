 Often, shipping weight is calculated as a percent added to the actual weight, to account for items that are shipped with the item but not modeled.;
,,


Go to the "Evaluate" tab and choose "Mass Properties".
Find the mass in this dialog and notice all the information about this model in this dialog. Say that the actual mass is 196.66 pounds.
 In this example, we will add ten percent to the actual mass, or simply, Shipping Weight= "The mass" x 1.10


Open the "Equations" dialog in SolidWorks.
Add a new Equation by clicking Tools, Equations, Add.
Using the equations dialog, create a variable called "Shipping Weight", by typing Shipping Weight in quotations and then put an equals sig.
Expand the inputs box by clicking the chevron at the bottom of the equations dialog box. This area calls any SolidWorks properties and any custom properties.
Click SW-Mass, which is the SolidWorks property for mass. This will add the proper callout to the right side of the equal sign.
Finish the "Shipping Weight" variable by adding the text * 1.10.
Double check the variable. It should read: "Shipping Weight"= "SW-MASS" * 1.10

Click OK to create the variable
Click OK to dismiss the equations dialog.
 To create a custom property we will need to click File, Properties.


Add a new configuration-specific custom property called "Shipping Weight".
Use the drop-down arrow to select the variable you just created.
 You could also put this property in a BOM at the assembly level. The custom property will automatically update to any design changes to the model.

 You can use the Photos app to send photos directly to notes, or create a new note straight from the Photos app. This method also allows you to add multiple photos to a note at once.This method will work in other apps that can store photos as well, such as Drive and Dropbox. The process will be largely the same.
 Tap the "Select" button in the upper-right corner and then tap each of the photos you want to add to your note. A blue checkmark will appear in the corner of each note you select.
 This looks like a box with an arrow coming out of the top. After tapping "Share," tap "Next" in the upper-right corner.
 This will be along the top row of icons. This only appears if you've upgraded Notes to the new service on iOS 9. You can do this by opening the Notes app, tapping the "<" button, and then tapping "Upgrade."

, You can type into the field to enter text for a new note. Enter some information about the picture's you're adding so that you can remember why you added them. This text will appear beneath the pictures you added to your new note.
 This will open a list of all of your existing notes. Tap the note that you want to add the pictures to.


This option will disappear if you start typing text for a new note.
After selecting an existing note, you can enter text to add to the note as well. This text will be placed below the pictures in the note.
 Your note will be saved, and you'll be able to find it in the Notes app.

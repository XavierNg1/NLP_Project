 Using a piece of paper, write a variety of different, simple words (e.g. box, top, bed, stop, cat, bird, etc.). Then ask your toddler to circle each word that starts with a specific letter, such as the letter ‘b.’Write a variety of these word groups and focus on different letters each time.
 Each day select a different letter that you and your toddler are going to focus on. Write or display that letter somewhere prominent where your toddler will see it all day. Then ask your toddler to go through magazines or newspapers and look for words that start with the letter of the day. Get your toddler to cut that word out and post it near the letter of the day.Another aspect of this game is to also ask your toddler to draw an object that starts with the letter of the day. For example, if the letter of the day was ‘d,’ your toddler might want to draw a dog.
 While reading your toddler a story, ask your toddler to point out words that start with a specific letter. You could do this page-by-page to help your toddler recognize that specific letter in different words., In addition to simply teaching toddlers how to spell their names, you can also play a game where you scramble the letters of their name so they have to put them back in order. This works best with letter cards that can be easily mixed up and put back in order.

 If you’re a non-citizen living in France, but you’ve been married to a French citizen for at least four years, you can apply for French citizenship. You’ll apply at your local prefecture, as indicated in Method 1 - Step 4, above.
 You must also still be married at the time of the application. Additionally, your spouse must have retained his or her French citizenship., If you’re the foreign spouse of a French citizen, the French immigration agency will require that you sign the CAI referenced earlier in this article. You must also complete all the CAI requirements, such as the oral and written French test, civics training, and information session.

, If your hair is naturally curly, use a curl-defining gel. If you have naturally wavy hair, try mousse. For straight hair, go for curl-enhancing gel.
 You can let your hair air-dry or dry it with a diffuser, lifting your hair at the roots to encourage volume.
 You can use a center or side part, whichever you prefer for styling.









Tie off the section you won't be working on first into a loose ponytail.
 Start from the back of your head and grasp a small section from the lowest layers.
 Start from the root of your hair and the tip of the curling iron. Wind the hair around the iron, gradually wrapping down to the base of the iron (where the handle is).









Note that your hair is not clamped into the curling iron or wand, but rather twisted around the barrel.
 Avoid holding it for too long - you don't want to fry your hair!









You may need to experiment with how long to hold your hair around the iron, as this varies depending on hair type.
 Work from back to front, starting with the lower layers and finishing with the upper.
 Move the section you've already curled to the front of your shoulder to keep it out of the way.
 Separate the curls as much as you like. If the curls are tighter than you wanted, keep in mind that within a few hours they'll relax a bit.
 Take just a little bit of product, rub it between your palms to soften, and work gently into your hair with your fingertips. This helps define the curls and keeps them soft.









Using styling wax instead of hair spray avoids the crunch and frizz that can come from sprays. However, if you prefer hair spray, spritz your curls with a light- or medium-hold spray.

Connect the resistor from 5v to the positive( big pin) on the IR receiver.
Connect all the IR LEDs to the 3.3v pin on the Arduino.
Connect a jumper from A0 on the Arduino to the positive leg on the IR receiver.
Connect all of the negatives of both the receiver and the LEDs to the GND on Arduino.
Make sure none of the wires or LEDs are shorting as LEDs are very sensitive and can burn.
 This is a simple code that will print out the IR data on your computer screen, these variables can then be used to control almost anything. This code will allow for a simple analog read of the IR sensor.


int IRreceiver = A0; // initialize






int IRval;






void setup()
{
pinMode(IRreceiver, INPUT); // declare its an input
Serial.begin(9600); // speed at which the communication will happen
}
void loop()
{
int IRval= analogRead(IRreceiver); // declare data
Serial.println(IRval); // print the data
delay(10); } // add a delay to smoothen things out

, After it's uploaded bring up the serial communication., The data should vary as the distance between the sensor and the object varies.

, Fifty years is a long time to be married and chances are you share a lot of important memories with your spouse. Look for something sentimental that reflects your relationship or is a reminder of your wedding day.


For example, you could celebrate your 50th wedding anniversary by purchasing a new set of wedding rings or have the diamonds reset into new rings, if the old bands are worn.
 Another meaningful gift would be to take your spouse on a special vacation. Perhaps you could take your spouse to the same spot where you spent your honeymoon or to a destination they have always wanted to go to.
 Despite the fact that this is your golden anniversary your spouse may not want something made from gold. Instead, you can look to get them something that is meaningful, such as a framed picture of the family.
 Violets are the flower that is associated with 50th wedding anniversaries because the leaves of a violet are heart shaped and the flower is purple in colour. You could give your spouse violets in a golden vase to combine two of the 50th wedding anniversary traditions.

 Use any kind of primer that is rated for stainless steel. Primer has a special bonding agent that allows it to hold to most substances, but you still need to get a high quality stainless steel primer. This will give you the smoothest result. White primer is recommended for most colors, but if you are painting your stainless steel a very dark color you might consider a darker primer.
 If you want a very smooth application, consider renting a spraying machine from a home improvement store. You can also use a paintbrush but you might leave ridges from the brush. Apply one coat of primer over the entire area you plan to paint. If you are using a sprayer, hold the nozzle 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7 cm) away from the stainless steel. Try to use a wide mist.
If you use a sprayer, make sure you paint in one direction. You may have ridges, but at least the grain of the paint will look consistent. Let the primer dry before you start painting.
 You’ve already completed the hard parts. Now all you need to do is add layers of paint to your stainless steel. Once your primer has dried you can start adding layers, but you should wait for each layer of paint to dry before you add a new one. Two or three layers should do the trick. Once again, you need to make the decision between a paintbrush and a sprayer. If you used the paintbrush to apply primer than you should use the paintbrush to apply the paint too. If you like the ridges and texture that a paintbrush offers you can also consider using a rag to add additional textures.
 Consult with the directions on the paint you bought so you know how long it takes to dry. Once it’s dry, you’re good to go.
 Apply a thin coat to the whole area that you painted and let the wax dry until it has a hazy look to it. Now take a clean dry cloth and buff the wax. This will add a final seal. It's okay to use automotive wax.

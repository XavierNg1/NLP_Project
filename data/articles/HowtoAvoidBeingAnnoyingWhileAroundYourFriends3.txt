 Your friends might be able to help you shed some light on your annoying behavior. They can tell you what behavior gets on your nerves and possibly give you some ideas to correct the behavior. Talk to a friend or friends who will tell you their opinion kindly and honestly.You could ask, “I realize that you guys get annoyed with me when I get really hyper. Have you noticed anything about my annoying behavior? I really want to stop it and am trying to figure it out.”
Press your friend for specifics. They might be uncomfortable and not want to make you feel bad, and say something like, “Oh, I don’t know, sometimes you just get annoying.” You could say, “What specifically do I do that gets on your nerves?”
Acknowledge to your friend that is an uncomfortable conversation for the both of you. You could say, “I really hate talking about this, and I think you do, too, but I really want to change my behavior, so I’d appreciate your insight.” Keep the conversation light: “I know; I drive myself crazy sometimes!”, Don’t try to be someone you’re not. Resist the urge to change who you are just to fit in. You will be unhappy, and you will not be able to cultivate healthy friendships.If you think you need to change yourself to fit in a group, maybe you should change the group instead.

Make new friends by getting involved in new activities at your school, religious organization, or in your community.
 Consider spending some time looking at your behavior and understanding why people find you annoying. Figure out what is the underlying reason for the behavior. This might be something you do with an adult you trust or a counselor, or something you do on your own.


For example, do you talk incessantly because you get nervous? Do you mope and drag everyone down because you want to talk to someone about how you really feel?
You could try writing in a journal to sort out your behavior and emotions. Journaling helps clarify what you feel and learn more about yourself.

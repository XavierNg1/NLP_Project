 You should know how long your speech needs to be. If you can't deliver the speech within the given amount of time, then you may need to shorten it or lengthen it. Remember to include time for a Q&A period if appropriate.
 Practice looking up at your audience so that your eyes aren't always on your notes.
 Pause between the sections of your speech so that your audience can digest the information.
 If words sound unnatural to you or a sentence is awkward as you speak it, mark it out and edit it to make it sound natural.
 Analyze your appearance, your body language and your delivery.


Make sure that your gestures are natural and not too frenetic. Alternatively, don't fix your arms at your sides or keep your hands latched to the podium.
If you make the speech to a friend and the friend offers constructive criticism, try to be open to what he or she has to say.
 If you've delivered your speech in rehearsal multiple times, then you will feel much more confident on-stage.

 Fan the cards out in front of him dramatically.


You can joke with him by saying, “Oh, I wouldn’t choose that one if I were you,” or pulling the deck away from him just as he’s supposed to pick one.;
, You want to make sure he doesn’t see it so that when you ask him to memorize it later, he will be distracted from what you’re doing., Place the piles face down in front of you. Keep a couple of cards in your left hand.
 While he is doing this, sneak a card from your left hand into your right hand. Keep your palm down so the card is hidden.It will take practice to get this move down. Start by practicing on your own. Then, invite a family member or friend to practice with you and point out what’s working and what’s not.
 Tell him to take one last look at it before it goes through to the other side of the table.
 Slap it to demonstrate, then pound it to demonstrate. When you slap it, let go of the card you have hidden in your right hand and leave it on top of the middle deck.Slapping the deck is just a decoy to get the hidden card from your right hand onto the middle deck. Tell your friend it is part of the magic.
 Your friend will think this is his card, but it is the card you had hidden in your right hand. Move this card to the top of the pile on your right.
 Add the middle deck to the top of the deck you just picked up.


Your friend’s card will now be on the top of the deck you are holding.
 Put the deck in your hand under the table with your left hand. Simultaneously slap the deck on the table with your right hand., Have you friend lift card from the top of your deck to reveal his card.


You can blow on the card before you extend the deck to your friend, and say to be careful because the card can get hot because of the speed it needs to reach to get through to the other side of the table.

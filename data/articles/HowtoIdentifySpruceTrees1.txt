 Before trying to narrow down the species of spruce tree, first make sure that you are not looking at a fir or pine. Examining the needles of the trees is the easiest way to make the distinction between them. The needles of a spruce tree are attached individually to its branches, as opposed to being in clusters. They also have four sides and roll easily between your fingers.The needles of pine trees grow in clusters, which makes them immediately distinguishable from spruce trees.
Like spruce needles, the needles of fir trees also grow individually. However, while spruce tree needles are sharply pointed and easy to roll between your fingers, fir needles are flatter, less pointy and canâ€™t be rolled between your fingers.;
, The cones of a spruce tree are also a good way to identify the tree. Cones grow from tree branches and contain the seeds of a tree. Spruces, pines and firs all contain cones, as do other conifers like cedars and hemlock trees. Spruce cones have smooth, thin scales, and are quite flexible and easy to bend. Pine cones have scales that are thick, rough and woody, which makes the cones inflexible., The needles of spruce trees grow out of small woody pegs from the branches. When the needles fall from the tree, these pegs are left behind, giving the branches a rough feel. The pegs look like little three-dimensional dots along the surface of the branch. The branches of fir and pine trees lack these stalks, and therefore feel smoother than those of spruce trees., Spruce trees are bushy and full, and have upturned branches. Fir trees, on the other hand, have downturned branches, making them easily distinguishable. Pine trees also have upturned branches but they have fewer branches which makes them look slightly sparser than spruce trees.

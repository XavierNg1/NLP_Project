 The key to projecting confidence during a presentation is to have a comprehensive knowledge of the topic. When you feel like an expert on a particular subject, you are more likely to project that expertise and knowledge to your listeners. Your audience will be able to tell if you are unprepared or nervous. Be sure to study your subject and your presentation slides thoroughly, and be prepared for any questions the audience may have.
 Position yourself in front of a mirror and practice giving your presentation. Pretend that you are in front of your peers and colleagues, and try to imagine that you are on the stage or in front of a classroom while speaking. This will allow you to practice your movements, your pace, your hand gestures, and it will remind you to smile during the speech. You will become more familiar with the material and the flow of the information. After several practice runs, you will be more comfortable and confident.
 Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose and hold for ten counts. Exhale slowly through your mouth, tightening your abdominals as you release the breath.Deep breathing can help you focus on your presentation and release any anxiety or tension in your body.Incorporate breathing exercises into your daily routine to help you relax and appear calm, composed, and confident in front of your audience.

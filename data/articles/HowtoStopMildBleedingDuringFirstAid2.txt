 Once you've stopped the bleeding, you need to wash out the wound. Use soap and water to clean it out, making sure to remove any dirt from the wound.This may be more easily done under running water or even in a shower.


If some of the dirt in the wound is stubborn, you can pluck it out with tweezers. Make sure to clean the tweezers with rubbing alcohol before using them so you don't introduce more bacteria.
If you can't get the wound completely clean, talk to your doctor., Use antibiotic ointment to lightly cover the wound. The idea is to keep the wound slightly moist. The point of the ointment is to help prevent infection., Once you've applied the ointment, it's time to cover it. You can use a regular adhesive bandage or simply sterile gauze and medical tape. Make sure the dressing covers the whole wound.If it's just a minor scrape, however, you can leave it uncovered. Covering it helps keep infection out., You should change the bandage at least once a day. In addition, you should change it if it's gotten wet or soiled. Therefore, if it's near your hands, you may need to change it frequently as you wash your hands throughout the day.As you change it, check on the cut. Once it's healed enough to be mostly scabbed over, you can leave the bandage off.
Watch for signs of infection, which include pus, redness, swelling, decreased mobility, and tenderness. The skin around the cut may also feel warm. Call your doctor if you suspect infection.

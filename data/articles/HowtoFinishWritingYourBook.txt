 Writer's Block is commonly caused by one of three things. Either you don't know what to write next, you're uninspired, or you aren't satisfied with what you write and end up erasing it.;
, First write a non detailed skeleton including only important parts of each chapter- ex: Chap One: 1)Marsha discovers her husband is having an affair 2)She divorces him & moves into a new apartment. 3)Marsha and Ken meet for first time. Continue this outline until you've outlined your entire book. Next, add a paragraph of detail into each part of the outline. Refer to this outline as you write.
 You know all the twists and turns, so none are exciting to you anymore. This problem can be easily solved. Take a few weeks to a few months away from writing. During this time, do not think of your book - imagine that it doesn't exist. When the time is up, pick up your book and read it again. Everything should seem new and interesting, and you'll be as excited as you were on the first day of writing!

, Do not edit it. Move on to the next part and complete the book. When you are finished, you can go back to these problem parts with a fresh perspective, and you would no longer be wasting time worrying over one part when you've got half a book to write.

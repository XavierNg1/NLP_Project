 Use a hammer to tap the top of the stake into the ground a half inch (12.7 mm) into the ground. The post should be one or two inches away from the tree or plant that you want to protect.If you are trying to protect a larger fruit tree, make sure that you get a long enough post so that animals won't be able to reach your fruit.
 Press down on the edges of the sleeve and roll the sleeve lengthwise. This will help open up the wire mesh so that you can slide it over your fruit tree. Once it's rolled, unroll it and open up the mesh so it looks like a tube.
 The wire mesh sleeve should fit over the stake that you put into the ground as well as your fruit tree. If the trunk of your fruit tree is larger, you may have to wrap the wire mesh around the tree.
 Overlap the wire mesh on top of the post in the ground and carefully staple it one inch from the top and bottom of the post. Continue to add staples with a staple gun every inch apart until the mesh sleeve is securely fastened to the post in the ground.
 If there is leftover mesh on the top of your tree guard, it could prevent the tree from growing. Use wire cutters to cut off any remaining mesh at the top and allow there to be a hole so that your tree can continue growing.

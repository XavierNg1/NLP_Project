 Say hi, and do a cute smile. If he responds, well done! Next thing; ask him how he is! If he returns with a question then you're onto a winner!;
, He will soon begin to notice you and realise how nice you are!

, An example conversation you might have would be is 'do you have any siblings at the school?' or 'so what lesson have you got next; do you like it?' Find out what his interests are, or what he thinks of a new song that's been released.
 Mention things he might be interested in; make him laugh! There is nothing better than making guys laugh. Once they know you have a sense of humor he should soon look forward to your lessons together because you can have 'a bit of a laugh'.
 Remember, You just have to be yourself! Compliment him on his new trainers; maybe ask if he's had a haircut because his new haircut is looking pretty good! Touch his arm when you're talking slightly. Or perhaps you could tease him a bit; but, play nice!!!

, Make it cool and casual. Say something like, 'is it cool if we swap numbers? I need someone to contact when I get stuck on homework!' You could also just ask it on Facebook just saying 'can I have your phone number?' I'm sure he'll say yes!

, Now this doesn't have to be a date if you don't want it to be! Invite all your friends out and ask him if he wanted to come and bring some of his mates, because it would be a good laugh!

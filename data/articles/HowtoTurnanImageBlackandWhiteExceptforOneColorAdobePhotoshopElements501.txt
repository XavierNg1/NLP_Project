 Make a copy for safekeeping. From the File menu, choose “Save as...”, and give it a name like MyFile_Colorized, or any name that strikes your fancy, and put it in whatever folder suits you best. The default will be the folder the original came from, which is why it’s important to rename the file.

Selecting a rectangle is interesting, but you might want to make more complex selections.
Select the entire area to remain colorized using the lasso or polygon lasso tool
Use the "add to" and "remove from" selection options to carve out the parts you don’t want colorized
Adding a one or two pixel "feather" option to the selection will make the color area blend with the non-color naturally.

This creates a new Hue/Saturation adjustment layer.
 In the Hue/Saturation adjustment window, drag the Saturation slider all the way to the left. As you drag it, notice the entire picture except the eyes starts to fade to black and white until your slider is all the way to the left. If you look at the Layers window, you will see the Hue/Saturation adjustment layer has a white layer mask with a small black rectangle in it. That's where your eyes are, and they're masked from the actions of the Hue/Saturation adjustments.

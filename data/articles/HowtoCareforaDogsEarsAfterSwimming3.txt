 Cleaning your dog’s ears regularly will help keep them happy and healthy, and may help keep away infection when your dog does get wet. Clean your dog’s ears once a week using a commercial cleaning solution and a cotton ball. Clean your dog’s ears with a cleaning solution the same way that you used the drying solution.Place a few drops in the dog’s ears
Massage the ears to distribute the solution
Massage a cotton ball around the ear canal opening to pick up excess solution and remove accumulated debris.
 When you have your dog groomed, add on an ear cleaning service if it is not already included. Professional ear cleanings may be able to get a bit more dirt and debris out of the ear canal, and may have more tools at their disposal to fully clean your dog’s ear.


Ask your groomer about packages that include ear cleanings, and how much it would cost to add on an ear cleaning if one is not included.
Many doggy daycares and boarding facilities also offer baths and ear cleanings. Ask your dog care facility if ear cleanings are available so that you can ensure your dog is clean and healthy when they come home.
 If your dog has stubborn wax or debris stuck in their ear, do not try to remove it yourself. Instead, go to your vet, who may be able to remove the wax with proper tools and cause minimum stress and discomfort to your dog.Let your vet know that you would like to come in for an ear cleaning as your dog has build-up in their ears that you have not been able to remove.

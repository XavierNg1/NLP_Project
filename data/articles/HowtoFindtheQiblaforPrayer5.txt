 This tried and true method will not tell you where the Qiblah is located, but if you know where you are in relation to Makkah, it's far more accurate than a stick in the ground. More detailed instructions on how to find the Qibla using a compass can be found here, or follow this:


Get yourself a Qibla compass.
Find out the direction to Mecca from you location.

Hold out your compass flat, wait for the dial to settle. Turn towards the direction to Makkah for your location. Done.

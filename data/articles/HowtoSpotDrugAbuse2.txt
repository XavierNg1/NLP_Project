 People who abuse drugs may show signs of poor hygiene. The person may have a disheveled appearance: their hair is messy, they need to shower, and they wear the same outfit again and again., You might also notice physical signs that your loved one is currently or recently intoxicated. These may include red eyes, dilated pupils, or strange eye movements. If your loved one is abusing intravenous drugs, they may also have track marks or red bruises on their arms., The flip side of a neglected appearance involves your loved one seemingly covering up any obvious signs of drug use. They may frequently use eye drops, smell strongly of cologne or perfume, or constantly use mints or chew gum., If your loved one is trying to sustain a drug habit, they will likely need more money than usual. If they fail to borrow from friends or family, they may start to steal. Keep track of valuable items or cash that seem to disappear around your household or in the homes of others close to the person., If your loved one lives in your home, you may be able to find hidden drug paraphernalia. Use your imagination to explore their room or other common living spaces. Look under beds and couches, in desk and clothing drawers, in between the pages of books, in CD and DVD cases, and under loose floor boards.Not-so-obvious places might be empty containers, such as over-the-counter pill bottles or candy and snack containers.

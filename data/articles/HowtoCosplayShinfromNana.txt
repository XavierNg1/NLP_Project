 Shin dresses either in quite extreme punk attire, such as bondage pants, leather and torn shirts, or in a uniform-ish, suit like outfit when he goes to work. He is most likely to wear combat boots or platform-sports.;
, Shin's hair is mid-length and spiked all up. In the anime it's dyed light blue, while in the live-action it's bleached. You may use hair wax or a very strong hair-gel or hair-spray to achieve this effect.
 Shin has quite many of them, as Komatsu Nana notes. However, the most noticeable piercing is Shin's sidelip, having a chain connecting between it and his lowest ear piercing. Except for that, he's got another regular pierce two helixes in his left ear, and one helix and three regular pierces in his right ear.
, Either leather-like or PVC should work for this. If you can't find the exact thing, probably a studded choker would do. He also wears a two-lines studded bracelet. Go for leather-like and not PVC in that case. It will look better.
 Shin is well-spoken and courteous toward people other than his friends. Around his friends he allows himself to talk more freely, often mocking Nobu or acting more childishly. When it comes to his parents, he turns rather distant and avoids opening the topic.
, This does not include Osaki Nana.

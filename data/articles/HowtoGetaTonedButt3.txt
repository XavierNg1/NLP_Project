 Throughout this exercise, keep your abdominal muscles engaged and avoid pushing your hips up too high. This will prevent your lower back from arching and becoming vulnerable to injury. Support your body weight with your arms.
 This exercise is similar to the bridge exercise except that you start with your knees bent and roll the ball away from yourself as you straighten your body. As you lower your body back to the floor, you roll the ball back toward yourself.
 Swimming kicks will challenge both your glutes and your core as you try to maintain your balance on top of the ball. For more of a challenge, only place one hand on the floor. Alternate hands so that you work your obliques equally.

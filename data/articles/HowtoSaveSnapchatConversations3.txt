 Tap the "Capture" icon at the bottom of your screen to snap a photo, or hold it down to record video.
 This is the downward-pointing arrow icon next to the snap timer in the lower-left corner of your screen.
 Your snap will be saved in your default gallery and you can view all your saved snaps here.

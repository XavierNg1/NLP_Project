 Exfoliants remove dead skin cells, which helps makeup settle better on your face. Apply some exfoliant. Don’t rub it in. Instead, gently massage or pat it in. Follow up by patting your face dry with a towel. Use the exfoliant at least twice a week.








If you have sensitive skin, use exfoliant sparingly.
 Toner replenishes your skin, so it’s useful anytime you apply a cleanser. Get a cotton ball or cosmetic pad. Dip it in a little bit of the toner, then use it to dab the toner across your face. It’ll keep your skin smooth and soft.Avoid using toners with alcohol. These can dry out your face.
 Moisturizer, when applied in the morning, shields your skin from the sun. It can be applied at night as well to reduce the formation of wrinkles and other marks that break up makeup. Look for product that has an SPF rating of 15 or higher. Rub it over your face and neck.Try using moisturizer before apply makeup and after you wash it off at night.
 Always remove makeup before you sleep. Wash your face at night to ensure you don’t leave stains on your pillow. A cleanser will help guarantee that your face is free of all makeup.










An oil-based cleanser is effective for removing makeup, but shouldn’t be used on oily skin. Instead, stick to gels and water-based cleansers.
 Lip balms also protect your skin and should be applied every morning. Look for ones with at least SPF 15, since these will protect your lips from sun damage. Avoid balms that have a shiny or glossy finish. These tend to look feminine.

 Every now and then, give your crush a sincere compliment. Tell them something you like about them. Maybe they’re really funny or smart. Perhaps they have a cool talent or skill.For example, you can say, “You’re an amazing skateboarder. How did you learn all of those tricks?”
Don’t shower them with compliments, or they may feel uncomfortable.
 Laughing shows that you are interested in what they are saying. When your crush says something funny, laugh or giggle gently. Don’t overdo it, though, or it may seem insincere., Your crush may be just as nervous about talking to you as you may be talking to them. To help them out, check your body language. Smile when you catch them looking at you. Instead of crossing your arms, try twirling your hair.When your crush walks towards you, don’t look away. Instead, make eye contact. Wave if you want to catch their eye.

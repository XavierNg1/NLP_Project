 Cystitis refers to a UTI in the lower urinary tract including the bladder and urethra. These UTIs are more common than pyelonephritis, which is a UTI in the upper urinary tract and kidney. UTIs in the kidney are much more rare. If you are concerned your child has an upper UTI, take him or her to the hospital.
 In cystitis, the symptoms are primarily the result of inflammation/infection of the lining of the bladder wall and urethra. This may cause any of the following:


Pain or the sensation of "burning" during urination.
Pain felt in the abdomen just above the pubic bone.
More frequent urination during the day or at night and sometimes with only small amounts of urine produced. Note that the frequency may be masked by attempts to hold off on urination because of the pain. Frequency is often accompanied by the sudden urgent need to urinate.
Urine with an unusually strong odor, or appearing cloudy or bloody.
Low-grade fever.
 Infections of the kidney (pyelonephritis) are generally more serious infections although symptoms, particularly in infants and very young children, may not immediately point to the kidneys. If you think your child may have pyelonephritis, take him/her to the hospital. Symptoms of cystitis may be present in addition to:


A more severe generalized ill appearance.
High fever.
Nausea or vomiting.
Shaking chills.
Pain in the flank (the side of the back).

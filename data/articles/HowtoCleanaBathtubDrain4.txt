 To plunge your drain, you'll also have to remove the faceplate from the overflow hole. The overflow hole usually has a metallic faceplate with screws and is usually under the spout for your bathtub. Use a screwdriver to remove the screws from the faceplate and then remove the faceplate itself.On certain tubs the overflow drain will have a switch to open or close the drain on your bathtub. In this case, you must remove the entire drain attached to the overflow faceplate.
 Filling the overflow hole with a rag will create the suction that's required to clear drains with the plunger. Shove a cotton towel or rag into the hole and try to make it as air tight as possible., If the tub isn't already filled with water, fill it up with two to three inches of water. Take extra care to not overflow your bathtub., Plunging helps free any obstructions that may be in the pipe. Place the plunger over the drain and press up and down on the handle. After 30 seconds of plunging, see if the drain flushes normally. If it does not, continue repeating the process until the tub drains.

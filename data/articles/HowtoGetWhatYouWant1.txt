 Everyone has a "to-do" list, and it is rarely completed. The problem with a to-do list is that it lacks urgency. Instead, a must-do list are the critical things that have to happen in order for you to advance.


Studies show that individuals who are constantly in motion towards their goals are generally more satisfied with life than those who reflect on issues.

Keep your list handy. Reference it throughout the day to make sure you're on track to reach your goals.
Make sure the goals are obtainable. Lofty goals are good for motivation, but make sure that your must-do list has concrete, obtainable goals for that day.;

 Keep the end goals in sight, and update them as your life and situation change.


Don't dwell on what you haven't accomplished yet. Instead, focus on your journey towards attaining your goals.

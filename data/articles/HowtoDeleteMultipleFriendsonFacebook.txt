 There is no longer any way to unfriend multiple people at once, but the Activity Log let's you quickly see your recent friend activity. This will let you quickly find the friends that you want to unfriend.


You can access the Activity Log by clicking the down arrow (â–¼) in the upper-right corner of the Facebook page. Select Activity Log from the menu.;
, In the left menu, click the "More" button underneath "Comments". From the expanded list, click "Friends". The Activity Log will change to only display the friends that you have added based on when you added them.
 Click the Pencil icon next to the friend that you want to remove. Click the Unfriend button, and then confirm it in the window that appears. Repeat this for each person you want to remove.


The Activity Log is a good way to do this, because it lets you quickly jump to time periods and remove multiple people that you friended in the same general time span.

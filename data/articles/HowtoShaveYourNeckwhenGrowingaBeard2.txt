 If you want a “hard stop” between your beard and your neck, simply shave away everything outside the neck line you’ve identified. Use short quick strokes to remove all the stubble or beard growth that is not inside the neck line., Instead of having a “hard stop” on your beard, you could have a neck line that gradually tapers down in beard thickness to smooth skin. To shave your neck into a fade while growing a beard, set your clippers at half the length of your regular setting. Using the clippers, trim the base of your neck line in a perimeter of about one inch (two centimeters) out from your neck line.Shave everything outside this perimeter bare.
 If you wish, you could create even more gradation within the fade by shaving the outer half inch (one centimeter) of the perimeter you’ve already shaved using an even shorter setting for your clippers. For instance, you could set the clippers to one-quarter of the standard length you use, then shave the outer portion of your one-inch fade.

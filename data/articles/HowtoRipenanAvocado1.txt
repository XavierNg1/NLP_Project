 The bag is used to trap the ethylene gas, which ripens the avocado. Make sure there aren't any holes in it!


The paper bag is just a trap. If you can devise some other mechanism that will trap in the air in the same way, great! That can be used, too. Your grandma might tell you to store it in the flour bin, but you may have to settle for the empty McDonald's bag.;
, Bananas are best, but the other fruits will do it, too. Some prefer using an apple because it can be used over and over again, even after it becomes old and wrinkly - it still emits gas. If you have none of these, but another avocado or two, put them all together.


These fruits emit more ethylene gas that other fruits. And the more ethylene gas they produce, the quicker everything will ripen., Keep it out of sunlight; 65ยบ-75ยบ F (18ยบ-24ยบ C) is best. If you don't have extra fruit in your bag, this will take 2-5 days., The added fruit will speed the ripening process considerably and it should ripen within 1 - 3 days.Your avocado is ready when it is easy to peel; feel it to see if it gives slightly as sometimes it's hard to tell by colour.


An unripe avocado will be nice and green. As it ripens, it will get hints of purple and black (that's when you can use it in about 2 days). When it's ready for your next meal, it's so dark green/brown it's practically purplish black.Once it's ripe, it will keep in the fridge for a few days, but it will lose its taste as time progresses.

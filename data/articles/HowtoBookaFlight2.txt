 Just as with online booking, think about where you plan or would like to travel, the dates you would like to go, if you just want to book flights or maybe a package deal.


Make a list of your plans and have them available while you talk to the travel or airline agent.
 You can call either traditional travel agents or airline reps to help you find the best flight booking.


Give the agent the information on your tentative travel plans. Also let them know pertinent information including your seat preferences, and if you are flexible in your travel dates and airlines.
Like with online booking, consider being flexible in your plans for the best prices and times.A good agent will alert you to all of the variables in booking your flight like alternative airports and smaller airlines. They’ll allow you to decide what offer is best for yourself.
 Call several travel agents and ask them for price quotes. By comparing what different agents offer, you will get the best flight deal.


If you find an agent you like but they don’t have the best offer, let them know about the lower price you found and see if they can match or better it.
 Once you decide on the right flight offer for your upcoming travel, it’s time to buy your ticket.


Call the agent and let them know which flight you’d like to book. Answer any questions they may have about items such as available seats or your meal preferences.
Ask questions about the booking. Find out about extra fees including taxes, baggage fees, and upgrade costs. Ask about cancellation and refund policies.
 Make sure to take these documents to the airport with you on the day of your flight to avoid any questions or problems with your booking.

 Before cleaning your cat’s feet, you should take a quick look at them. This will provide you with information about the general health of your cat’s feet. When examining their feet:


Look for redness or sores. This could indicate allergies or infections.
See if there is any green or black pus. This could indicate a virus or infection.
If your cat has infection between their pads, your veterinarian may recommend an antifungal soak using such medicines as captan, chlorhexidine, or povidone iodine.;
, By rinsing their feet, you'll remove dirt and grime and make it easier for you to wipe down and clean your cat's feet. You’ll also aid in their self-cleaning process by removing debris before they lick their own feet.


Pour warm water (99 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius) into a medium size bowl or similar container.
Quickly dip your cat's feet (one at a time) into the water.
Skip this step if your cat doesn't want their feet dipped., After dipping, you should gently wipe your cat's feet in order to remove any excess dirt that remained after dipping. Wiping their feet down is important, as you'll be able to get dirt that wasn't removed when you rinsed their feet.


Wet a clean microfiber cloth in warm water (99 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius).
Dab or wipe their feet thoroughly.
If their feet are particularly dirty, use a little bit more water.
If your cat resists your attempts to clean their feet, let them go. Don’t get yourself hurt or hurt your cat holding them down.
If for some reason you need to use a shampoo or similar product, make sure it is formulated for cats. In addition, follow manufacturer directions regarding proper dilution., In order to clean your cat's feet properly, you need to make sure that you clean between their toes. This is important, as dirt and grime may accumulate in hard-to-reach areas of your cat's foot.


Gently separate their toes.
Use your cloth or rag to wipe away dirt.
Rinse your rag after you've cleaned a crevice between toes., Since cats regularly lick their own feet to clean them, you should avoid using soaps or other chemicals not intended for cats. By using these products, you’ll potentially introduce chemicals that your cat will wind up licking and digesting. Stay away from:


Artificial dyes
Parabens
Sodium laurel sulphate
Petrochemicals
Human cleaning products
Cleaning products formulated for other animals

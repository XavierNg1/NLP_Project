 You’ll only come out ahead if you can pay off your debts before the 0% APR period ends. If you can’t, then the interest rate will zoom up, often over 15%, which will cost you a lot of money.

The interest rate on a personal loan will be lower than 15%, so avoid using a balance transfer unless you can pay everything off early., Transferring is easy. You simply tell the credit card company the account you want transferred and the amount. The amount should show up on your next statement., The 0% APR is only good if you make monthly payments in full and on time. If you don’t, then you’ll lose the introductory rate and probably pay penalties and fees on top of it.Set payment reminders, if necessary. For example, many credit card companies will send a text or an email reminder.


You’ll have an easier time paying your bills if you create a budget and stop spending. Some people see that their monthly payments are low, so they spend even more. Avoid this.

 Surgery is a last resort, and it is is only recommended if your bunions cause you frequent pain and get worse within a year. Often, surgery is done if the bunion is causing other foot issues and negatively affecting the second toe on your foot.Keep in mind that though surgery is the only way to get rid of your bunions, your bunions can grow back if your feet are agitated by improper shoes. You should always wear correctly fitted shoes to prevent your bunions from returning after surgery., There are several different surgical options to treat bunions and the type of surgery you get will depend on how severe your bunions are. Your surgeon may remove the bunions and use pins, wires, or screws to hold the bones in your feet in place to allow them to heal.The most common type of bunion surgery is osteotomy. This procedure involves cutting and removing part of the bone in your toe. The surgeon will also realign the bone inside your big toe and move your toe joint back in line.
Your surgeon may recommend arthrodesis if your big toe is severely deformed due to the bunion and it is too difficult to fix the joint. This procedure involves fusing together two bones in your big toe joint. After this procedure, you will have limited movement of your big toe and you cannot wear high heels.
Most bunion surgeries take about one hour and are done under general anesthesia. Your surgeon should outline the procedure fully for you before you go under.
 Post-surgery, your foot may be swollen for up to three months. You will need to rest your foot to reduce the swelling and use crutches so your foot can heal. You may also need to wear a cast and shoes specially made to allow you to walk on your heels.After your foot has healed, you can go back to wearing normal shoes. However, you should always wear properly fitted and supportive shoes to prevent your bunions from appearing again.

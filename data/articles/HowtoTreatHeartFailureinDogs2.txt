 A diuretic is a drug that helps to move retained fluid from the body. During heart failure fluid leaks out of the circulatory system and builds up either within the lungs (pulmonary edema), inside the chest cavity (pleural effusion), or in the abdomen (ascites). Each of these scenarios means the heart has to work even harder to push blood through the tissues and bring about effective oxygen exchange.


Getting rid of, or reducing, the amount of retained fluid helps to reduce the load on your dog’s heart. This reduces the effort the heart has to put into circulating blood.
 Furosemide is a "loop diuretic" which means it works by stopping sodium and chloride (which make up salt) from being reabsorbed by your dog’s kidneys. This then causes your dog to urinate more, which helps to get rid of salt buildup.


Furosemide is generally administered twice a day at a dose of 2 mg per kg body weight. For example, a 10 kg Cavalier King Charles Spaniel would start at a dose of 20 mg twice a day. This medication is available in 20 mg and 40 mg tablets, and a 50 mg/ml injectable form.Feed your dog bananas while giving him furosemide. Long term use of furosemide can cause your dog’s potassium levels to drop. To replenish the potassium, you can feed your dog one banana each day., Spironolactone is generally prescribed when you cannot increase your dog’s dose of furosemide any further. This drug works to bind to mineralocorticoid receptors in your dog’s kidney, heart, and blood vessels. Mineralocorticoid receptors help to regulate water transportation and maintain normal salt levels.


Spironolactone is generally prescribed as 2 mg per kg once daily by mouth, with food. It comes in 10, 40, and 80 mg tablets. For example, a typical 10 kg Cavalier would take half a 40 mg tablet once daily with food.

 If you want to print wirelessly from your laptop, you have two basic options when it comes to installing a printer: You can either install a network printer that connects directly to your home network, or you can share a printer that is connected to another computer on your network. The option you choose will likely be dictated by the connections that your printer supports, as well as your home network setup.


Most modern printers will connect to your home's wireless network. Some network printers can only connect via Ethernet cable. Older printers or budget printers will likely need to be connected to a computer via USB and then shared on the network.
 Printers that are connected directly to the network can typically be easily accessed by both Windows and Mac laptops. Printers that are connected to a computer and then shared on the network are easily accessed by computers running the same operating system family (Windows-to-Windows or Mac-to-Mac), but get a little trickier when sharing across operating systems. Since it requires fairly different steps, click here for instructions on sharing a printer across operating systems.


Installing the printer directly to the network is almost always the better choice if possible. Not only does it allow for easier connectivity, but it also means that the printer is constantly available. If you are sharing a printer that's connected to another computer, that computer will need to be turned on in order to access the printer.

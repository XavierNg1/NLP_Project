 This device usually costs around $99.


If you have AirPlay enabled speakers, Apple AirPort, or receivers that are labeled as being AirPlay compatible, you can skip the Apple TV and use one of these device, instead. Since they are all more expensive, though, Apple TV is your best option if you are starting from scratch.
Note that you will also need an iPod that is running iOS 4.2 or above, as well as a reliable wireless network.
 Connect the Apple TV to your wireless network. Verify that AirPlay is turned on by going to the Settings menu and selecting the AirPlay on your Apple TV option.


When you connect the Apple TV box to your TV for the first time, it should automatically take you through a series of on-screen instructions. When asked, select your home wireless network from the list of available networks and enter the correct password, if your wireless network uses one.
 Make sure that your iPod is connected to the same wireless network that your Apple TV is currently on.


Choose "Settings" from the main screen or home screen of your iPod device.
Scroll down to the "Wi-Fi" option and select it.
Turn on Wi-Fi, and scroll through the list of available wireless networks until you find yours. Highlight your network and hit the "Choose Network" option to select it.
When prompted, enter the network password, if applicable.
 Navigate to your saved videos on the iPod as you usually do. Select a video, then hit the "Play" option. An AirPlay icon should show up when you do this. Click on it and select "Apple TV" from the options.


Your video should begin streaming on your TV as soon as you complete this step.

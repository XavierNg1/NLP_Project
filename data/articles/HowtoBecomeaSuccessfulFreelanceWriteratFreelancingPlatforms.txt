 An attractive profile and a resume is the key to success. The first thing you should do to get your job, is to create an attractive profile with a resume. It should not be too long, it should contain your key strengths in an attractive and easy to read format. Don't list any irrelevant information, for example, your marital status or any other unnecessary personal information because it could turn off your potential client. Stand out from the crowd by marketing yourself in a resume.;
, This step is optional, but can significantly increase your chances of getting a job. If you have done any writing work before, the second thing you could do is to create some sort of portfolio, for example, a blog. There are many easy options to create a professionally looking one (WordPress, Blogspot, etc.). By having it, you can demonstrate to the potential client your competence of being suitable for a job.
 If you think you are ready, firstly, look for a small job. Not everyone at the beginning started making hundreds of dollars per hour by doing their freelance jobs. Don't intimidate or be ashamed of any work you will find. Try looking for something that interests you and that you will be able to do it easily. You will definitely benefit from these small jobs. You will bulk out your portfolio, it is a chance to get some contacts, and also, it is a good practice to prepare yourself for a future job.
 The last thing I could advise you is to be professional. It is necessary to make a good first impression to any potential client. Follow their instructions in a job listing, always write in a polite, grammatically correct, straight to the point form, show confidence in yourself and your work, and always try to reply to messages promptly. I hope that these advises will help you get your first job. Good luck!

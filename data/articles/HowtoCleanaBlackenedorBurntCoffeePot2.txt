 White vinegar is known for its extra special cleaning properties and is great for stubborn blackened or burnt stains on coffee pots. Fill the pot to the brim with white vinegar. Let it sit overnight to soak.
 Place that bowl to the side for later, and wash the coffee pot out with hot soapy water. The majority of the brown stains the coffee pot accrued should be gone completely., Fill the coffee pot with the saved vinegar and allow it to soak overnight. Keep repeating the previous step until all of the stubborn stains have been removed and the coffee pot looks like new again.

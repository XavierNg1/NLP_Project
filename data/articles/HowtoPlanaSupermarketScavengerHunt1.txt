 Concentrate the scavenger hunt on colors and names for younger children, while older children would be challenged on nutritional facts, price differences, and research questions.



Safety should be a top priority, so exclude any items on top shelves or places where the participants cannot reach.
Depending on the number of items and challenge difficulties, set a time limit for everyone to complete the hunt.
No item should be purchased, so disallow any cart or basket holding, as they should only need a pen and paper to collect the information with.

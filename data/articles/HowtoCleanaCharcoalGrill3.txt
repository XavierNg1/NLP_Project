 This technique can be especially helpful with thick cuts of fish. Combined with a lower temperature, a light coating of refined olive oil or corn oil can also help prevent fish from sticking to the grate of your grill.
 A fish basket is a grill accessory that hinges open to hold cuts of fish inside fine metal tines. Lightly oil the fish with a high temperature cooking oil and insert it into the basket. Use an oven mitt to pick up the handles of the basket and turn the fish when one side is finished cooking.

The handles on many kinds of fish basket, while convenient for turning the basket, can sometimes prevent you from closing the lid of your grill. This may add to the cooking time of the fish.If you donâ€™t have a fish basket, wrap the fish in a packet of aluminum foil. Place this on your grill to cook the fish., Place a cast iron griddle onto the grate of your grill. Lightly coat the griddle with a high temperature cooking oil. Place the fish on the griddle to cook it and flip the fish when its first side is finished cooking.









A griddle with an oil-catching groove around the edges will prevent oil and fish juices from dripping into the flames. Oil and juices can cause flare ups.

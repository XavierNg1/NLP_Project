 Survivors' benefits are available to the spouse, children or dependents of a person who had sufficiently paid into the Social Security Trust Fund. Start here to find out if you're eligible to receive benefits. Or, figure out your survivors would receive if you were to pass away.
 If you are already receiving other Social Security benefits, the survivors' benefit amount will simply be added to your current amount. Unfortunately, applications for survivors' benefits cannot currently be processed online. Visit your local SSA office, or call (800) 772-1213 (TTY (800) 325-0778) to apply.

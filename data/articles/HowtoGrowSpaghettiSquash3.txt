 There won’t be enough time left for them to mature and the plant’s resources would be better used growing the already-developing squash on the vine. Because the squash will be growing for the full length of the season, they can be prone to getting rot underneath where they lay on the soil. You can help protect your squash with tiles or coffee can lids under each fruit.
 Once the wide leaves are fully grown, they will start to shade their surrounding soil and will keep the weeds out without your help.
 If you do grow a vining squash, be prepared to have the vines spill out of the container for several feet.
 You'll need at least 5 gallons for each plant.


Give them a light feeding part of the way through the growing season to make up for the lack of soil nutrients in the pot.
 The most common insect attacker will be squash bugs, followed closely by the popular cucumber beetle. They are both big enough to be picked off by hand as soon as you see one, but make sure to check inside the blossoms as well as under the large leaves. And those large leaves may be a benefit when it comes to weed control, but they are susceptible to getting mildew if weather is damp. It looks like a dusting of white powder on the leaves and it can effect your plant’s development and growth if it gets too heavy.


Standard fungicide sprays can help to clear it up, and you can keep it from starting by watering your plants right at the soil instead of pouring water over all the leaves.
Once established and growing well, a squash vine is quite large and can withstand a fair bit of insect damage without ill effects.

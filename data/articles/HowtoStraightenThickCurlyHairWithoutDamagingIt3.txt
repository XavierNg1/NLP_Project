 Sometimes people have a tendency to over-straighten their hair, especially if they have thick or curly hair. If this happens then the best thing to do is add a little volumizing spray to your hair to perk it up a bit.
 Frizz is the bane of every curly girl's existence. This is especially true if you live somewhere that has lots of rain or humidity. Product is your friend. Use it.


There is some debate about silicon based serums. Some say they are the best thing ever and some people swear that they make their hair too greasy. You'll have to decide what works best for you, silicone or no silicone.
 This can make your hair a lot more manageable when you're straightening it and it will help you to get those pesky back portions of your hair.
 Two things can cause your hair to sizzle when you're straightening it. One, your hair is not completely dry. If this is the case, cease with the straightening and get with the drying.








If your hair is perfectly dry it could be that there is excess product build-up in your hair. Make sure that you're selective about which products you put in your hair (it's a good idea to avoid alcohol based products).

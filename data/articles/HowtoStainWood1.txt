 This will determine how you proceed and the effect you can expect at the end.









Basic wood types are:

Softwoods- Pine, Fir and Cedar. (etc.)
Hardwoods- Oak, Beech, Ash, Elm, Birch and Walnut.(etc.)


This is sometimes confusing because you have:

Box wood and Aspen: A very soft Hardwood.
Fir: A very hard Softwood.

;
, If the wood has uneven wood grain, or blotchy patterns to it, chances are it is a softwood. When you stain it, it will stain unevenly. You may want this, to let the stain enhance the natural beauty of the wood. If you do not want this, place a pre-stain wood conditioner on your wood. It seeps into the wood fibers so that the wood will stain evenly. Check with the manufacturer.
 If the wood has a consistent flow or pattern to the grain, it's probably a hardwood. Use whatever stain you wish to enhance the wood grain.









Hardwoods, such as oak, may take a few more coatings of stain than softwood, but the results are still very pleasing.

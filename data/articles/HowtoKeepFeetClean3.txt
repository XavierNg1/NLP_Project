 Choose shoes that have a little lift to them, especially if you're wearing sandals. Shoes that are slightly higher above the ground can help protect your feet from dirt and germs on the street.However, keep in mind wearing uncomfortable shoes is bad for your overall foot health. If a shoe has a very high arch that causes discomfort, choose a different shoe.
 Shoes made from breathable materials will absorb sweat. This keeps your feet cleaner and less smelly.As moisture can lead to fungus, it can also help prevent fungal infections.


Breathable materials include things like cork, leather, and rubber.
 Shoes become wet during the day from exposure to moisture outside and sweat from your feet. At night, place your shoes in a well-ventilated area so they can air out. This will keep your shoes cleaner and make them smell fresher.This is especially important if you intend to wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row.
 If you wear the same shoes every day, they can get pretty smelly! This can also make your feet smell bad. Let your shoes dry out for a couple of days before wearing them again.This is especially important for shoes you wear for athletic activities, like running or going to the gym.
 Shoes do not last indefinitely and holding on to old shoes is unsanitary. Shoes can harbor bacteria that causes fungus. If your shoes are becoming old and tattered, throw them out. Shoes can be washed or sprayed with cleaning solutions and anti-fungal sprays, but worn down shoes that are many years old are best discarded.This is especially important if you had a nail infection in the past. Shoes that you wore during a fungal infection may reinfect your feet if worn again.

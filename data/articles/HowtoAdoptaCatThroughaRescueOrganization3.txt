 Kittens – like little kids – can scare easily and often don’t know the difference between a threat and an opportunity to play. For this reason, if you have young children at home, adopt an adult cat., All cats need some attention and affection. But kittens tend to need a lot of attention and stimulation. As cats age, they tend to require less care and become more independent. Therefore, if you are out working or otherwise predisposed for much of the day, avoid getting a kitten., Cats can live up to 20 years or more. If you’re unsure whether you want to be responsible for a cat that long, adopt an older cat. That way, when you’re ready to take that round-the-world trip, you won’t be tethered to caring for your cat at home., If you already have a cat or dog at home, adopt a cat that is known to get along with the sort of pet you already own. To identify which cats will get along with other pets, ask rescue organization personnel for advice regarding which cats have interacted successfully with other pets.Additionally, don’t adopt two cats of the same gender. The urge to be dominant will cause conflicts.
For the same reason, if you already have a cat at home, adopt a cat that is younger than it.

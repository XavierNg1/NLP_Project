 Make sure you have a 3-wood, a mix of irons and a putter in your set. These clubs will help you familiarize yourself with the game and better understand the style you have.;
, Don’t go in for the expensive, top-of-the-line products immediately, rather work your way up. Here is where you pick a set based on the side you play on and your gender. You can also choose between steel and graphite shafts, though if you are a beginner, steel shafts are wallet-friendly and durable. Your set should have a 3-wood, driver, and clubs in odd numbers of 3, 5, 7 as well as 9. A putter and bag will complete your set.
 The idea is to try to improve on your game, so you will be looking for clubs with lower workability and forgiveness to match your style of swing. These sets will include a driver, woods of 3 and 5, 3-through pitching wedge irons and your choice of a putter. Don’t invest in specialty clubs at this stage.
 Get specialty irons like a useful 60-degree lob wedge or a sand one only when you are ready to do so. A long iron can prove to be quite useful. This will also be the time to replace one of your 3-irons with a 7-wood, especially if a long iron is not helpful.
 This is the stage where brand and unique models should be considered.

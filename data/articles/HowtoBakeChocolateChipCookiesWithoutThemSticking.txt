 This the best choice. The dough won't move off of it while in dough form, yet the cookies will come right off after only one or two minutes of cooling.;
, Overcooking it will make the cookies burn (duh) and stick to the baking tray. Plus, cooking for 8-10 minutes makes soft and yummy cookies. Burning is bad!

, In the case of a "pan-sticker", use a very thin spatula to slice beneath the cookies and lift them in one piece. Don't use a knife unless you're using parchment paper, in which case a cleaver is the perfect choice for getting burnt cookies up. Get as much of the cookie up as you can. If you don't use paper, stick the pan in the sink and wet one side at a time. Drizzle dishwashing soap on the wet side, and use either a dishcloth or scrubbing brush to loosen the remains, then, rinse off the chunks of cookie with the sprayer nozzle.
 Large cookies don't tend to cook all the way through, and they're the easiest to burn. Roll cookie dough so that it fits in the centre of a cupped hand, inside the palm.

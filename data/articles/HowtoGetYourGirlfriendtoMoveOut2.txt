 If you and your girlfriend are unable to come to an agreement, you may try to make it clear that she is no longer welcome in your home. She may be trying to hold onto your relationship long enough for the troubles to blow over. If you are serious about wanting her to leave, make it clear by being honest and upfront with her.Once you’ve been clear, you might want to be absent from the home a little more. Give her the time/space to move out, and avoid falling back into your previous relationship roles.If she keeps pushing the issue, gently remind her that you've made up your mind and you are no longer willing to discuss it.
 Packing her bags sends a very clear message that you want her to leave. This method is pretty harsh and will more than likely upset her. If you do choose to pack her bags, do so neatly and carefully. Do not break her things. If the two of you own things together (like a couch or bed), it may be difficult to just pack her things. You might need to reach some agreement as to who keeps what., You might have good reason for asking her to leave, like you own the home and she doesn’t. If that’s not the case, you should consider moving out of the home yourself. She may have just as much claim to the home as you, and the two of you will have to come to some sort of agreement.If your girlfriend is refusing to accept the breakup, then moving out may be the best solution. Decide if keeping the place yourself is worth this dragging out.

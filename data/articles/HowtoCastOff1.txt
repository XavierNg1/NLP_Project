 Start by knitting the first two stitches moving from the left needle onto the right needle.





;
, Push the tip of the left needle into the first stitch that you made on the right needle.
 To bind off the first stitch, use the needle to lift the first stitch up and over the second stitch and then drop it off the right needle. Knit another stitch from the left needle and do the same thing again.
 Do this with each stitch until there are no stitches on the left needle and just one stitch remains on the right needle.
 With your fingers, gently pull on the last stitch to make it a little bit bigger. Then pull the end of the yarn all the way through the loop, take the needle out and pull the yarn tight.

Colouration: Red Polls have a deep red colouration all throughout except on their tail switches, which is always white. Their noses are quite pink too, in contrast to the colouration of the rest of their bodies.

Body type and characteristics: Red Polls are a British-type beef breed, with the same kind of muscularity that is found in Angus, Shorthorn and Hereford cattle. They are a medium to small-framed breed, like all British breeds are.

Head characteristics: Red Polls are naturally polled.

Other characteristics: This breed was originally made as a dual purpose breed in England in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. They are a fairly old breed, first described by Rev. Arthur Young in 1794. Red Polls are very docile, making them great to work with, and they are heavy milkers with the ability to drop small but weighty beefy calves; these same cows have excellent calving ease. They are a breed that is great for grass-only operations because of their excellent foraging ability. Cows and bulls are long-lived, able to breed well into their 'teens, minimizing the number of replacements needed for raising this breed. They are a tough, durable breed, that can thrive quite well in colder environments (if they're fed properly of course.)

,, Take pictures of what you thought were Red Poll cattle, and compare them with pictures of Red Poll cattle on the Internet and in your cattle breeds book.
 A little cow that could raise a calf and provide the family with milk, produce a bullock to pull the wagon or plow; got breed to many native breeds. The breed has strong trait of white in the tail, poll (takes horns off most) and is an easy keeper. Being calm natured was important to many pioneer families and she often was the only cow on a small farm. This trait of being o.k. with being alone without others is uncommon; but a trait of this breed.
 You will find red poll steers finish very well on grass for this reason; they have a straight back.

 Agents help people. But you'll have to know and understand all the rules before taking actions.;
, Help new chobots, and older ones. Help new ones by showing them around, giving tips and advice. Tell them how to buy clothes, magic and hoverboards. You could also show them how to play games and trade items.
 You can make a free blog at Blogger or Wordpress. Ask people on chobots to follow your blog. Remember to customise your blog and keep it updated regularly. Also, you could join the journalist program to get extra help.
 Never use bad language, don't bully users. You can find the rules on the blog.
 You can also use the emergency message to notify the moderators of anything that is very serious. Make sure to check the right boxes according to why you are reporting them.
 If this continues, report them, and in the worst case, message a moderator.
 Talk to them regularly, get to know them, and they will help recommend you.
 This is a simple rule that should be very easy to follow if you have already gotten this far.
 This means following rules about chat, no bad words, no hurtful comments, and do not bully other users verbally.
 This is the worst thing to do. If moderators or agents know that you aren't trying very hard, and just asking to become an agent, you will lower your chances of achieving the overall goal - agency. Like before, make friends with them, but never ask.
 Obviously, this is optional, and doesn't really affect your chances of agency, but it shows that you enjoy the game enough to become a citizen.
 This increases your chance on becoming an agent and will more likely add you to the nominated Chobots list.

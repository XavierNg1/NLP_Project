 Add the butter or olive oil to a large skillet and place it on the stove over medium-high heat, until the butter has melted or the oil has become smooth enough to coat the entire pan.;
, Sprinkle both sides of the chops with equal amounts of salt, black pepper, dried herbs, and garlic powder or onion powder. Pat the chops gently to run the spices into the meat.
 Sear the chops for 2 minutes on each side, or until each side is well-browned.Pork chops are notorious for drying out when cooked, but there are a few ways to prevent this. Searing the meat is one of the simplest ways. Searing the surface of the meat creates a barrier along the surface, thereby locking more of the moisture inside.
 Lower the heat to medium, cover the skillet, and let the chops cook for another 5 to 10 minutes.


To accurately determine whether or not the pork chops are safe to eat, check the center of the thickest chop with a meat thermometer. The internal temperature of pork chops must reach at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius) before the pork is safe to eat.If you do not have a meat thermometer, you can determine if the pork chops are done by cutting into the center of the thickest cut. If the meat is white, it is likely safe to eat.
 Let the pork chops rest for roughly 3 minutes before placing on individual serving plates and enjoying.

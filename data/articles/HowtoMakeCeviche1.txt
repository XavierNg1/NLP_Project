 of fresh red snapper fillets. To remove the bones from the fillets, simply run a knife along the snapper and cut off the hard white bones. ,, Place the fillets, 1/2 finely diced onion, 1 cup of chopped tomatoes, 1 finely diced and seeded serrano chili, 2 tsp. of salt, one pinch of cayenne pepper, and one dash of ground oregano in either a Pyrex or ceramic fish., Don't stir.,,, After the fish has soaked in the juices, you should stir the fish and ingredients carefully, so they're evenly distributed over the fish., Let it sit for a few more hours. This will give the flavors enough time to blend and to fill the fish with a tangy, refreshing flavor. As the fish absorbs the flavor, its color will change from a pinkish gray and translucent to a whiter color., Sprinkle it with 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro and top with slices of 1 diced avocado., Remove the dish from the refrigerator and serve with tortilla chips. The ceviche can be enjoyed as a dip for the tortilla chips or the chips can serve as a compliment to the dish.

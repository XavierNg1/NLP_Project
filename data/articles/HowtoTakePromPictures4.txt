 You can buy large wooden letters at a craft store. You can decorate with them paint or glitter and use them to spell words. For example, four people could stand together and spell out the word "Prom."If you want, paint the letters in your school's colors.
 A fun shot can be one of everyone jumping in the air. If you want a creative pose, have all your friends line up. Then, have everyone jump while you take a picture.It can be hard to get the exact right jump shot. Try having people jump up and down while someone takes multiple shots. This way, you'll have a lot of options.
 Don't be afraid to add props to your pictures. You can hold up things that represent your high school experience. For example, if you're on the hockey team, hold up a hockey stick. If your mascot is the panther, hold up a stuffed panther.You can also make use of any props near your surroundings. For example, if your home has a swing set, take pictures of people playing on it.
Try funny props to lighten the mood. Hold giant pairs of sunglasses, for example, or put on fake mustaches. Not all your prom photos have to be dead serious.
 To add some fun to your photos, use glitter and confetti. Take handfuls of glitter and confetti and throw them in the air while pictures are being taken. This can give your photographs a magical, fairy tale-like feel.Be careful to throw glitter away from your clothing. It can easily get stuck to dresses and suits.

 It can be hard to utilize your lats, especially if you're new to flexing. Seek out the help of a professional trainer. If your gym provides trainers to members, take advantage of this. You can also look up trainers online.
 There's always a risk of injury if you're engaging in new workouts, flexes, or poses. If you feel strain at any point, stop what you're doing. Flexing past the point of pain can cause injury.
 Flexing gets easier with practice. Each day, between sets during workouts or weight lifting, practice your flexing.While you can practice flexing every day, be aware you should not weight lift every day. Always take breaks between days that you weight train.
 When you first start flexing your lats, you may inadvertently stretch or flex the wrong muscles. Make sure you flex your lats and not areas like your back, shoulder blades, or arms.If you get confused during a flex, stop and cross your arms like you did to originally locate your lat muscles. This will remind you which muscles to flex while flexing your lats.

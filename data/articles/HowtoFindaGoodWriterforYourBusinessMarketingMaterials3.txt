 Some writers work per hour, some by the page and others by the project. You should have a payment amount in mind, but be ready to negotiate depending on the writer's skill and experience.


You can get a handle on going rates for the writing services you want from a current edition of Writer's Market ("How Much Should I Charge?") or by visiting the Web site of the Editorial Freelancers Association (http://www.the-efa.org/res/rates.php).
If cost is a concern, agree on either a maximum flat project fee or number of hours. If the writer exceeds this amount, he or she may end up working the extra hours gratis. Do keep in mind that many writing projects require a certain number of rewrites and agree on the number of rewrites when determining the free or hour cap.
 You'll want to have a final deadline for the entire project, and if there are individual components to it, you'll probably also want to establish deadlines for the each component or draft.
 Draft a contract stating the project's scope, terms and conditions, fees and deadlines. Both you and the writer need to sign it to protect each of you when problems arise.
 Questions will arise on both sides during the course of the project. By asking questions and providing answers in a timely fashion, you help to ensure that little problems get resolved before they grow into big problems.

 Start by holding the dowsing or divining rods steady and straight in your hands, at an arm’s length from your body. Make sure the rod ends are not tipped upward or downward. You should also make sure the rods are 9 inches (22.9 cm) from each other.If you are using a “Y” shaped rod, the rod should be pointed upward at a 45 degree angle. This will ensure you are able to get a good reading of the area.
 Often, water dowsers are called to locate water in a certain area, such as a rural or suburban community. You should hold the rods properly and walk back and forth slowly over the area that you are testing for water. Make sure you hold the rods lightly but with some grip so they do not roll or shift in your hands as you walk., Once the rods detect water, the butt end of the stick should rotate or be pulled downward. The rods may also cross over each other when you stand in a certain spot in the area, indicating there may be water under the surface.It may also help to visualize the water under the earth as you walk over the area with the rods. You may picture a stream or body of water in your mind as you hold the rods to help let the rods know what you are looking for.

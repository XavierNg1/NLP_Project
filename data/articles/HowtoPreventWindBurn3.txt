 A humidifier works on both the inside and the outside, allowing your skin to stay hydrated by introducing atmospheric moisture to dry air. Humidifiers help not only with preventing windburn, but also with treating winter conditions such as sore throats and coughs.Humidifiers are generally either warm or cool mist. Choosing between the two is a matter of personal preference, and you may find that different humidifiers better suit different needs.A warm mist humidifier, for example, may be useful while sleeping, while a cold mist humidifier might make more sense at a desk or an office where temperature is controlled but atmospheric moisture is not.
Humidifiers can easily be purchased at home goods stores, departments stores, or online.
 Carry a water bottle around and set reminders for yourself to help you remember to get two to three liters of water per day. Water helps to replenish your bodyâ€™s moisture, and is fundamental in both the prevention of and recovery from windburn.It is recommended that the average adult man get three liters of water a day, and that the average adult woman get 2.2 liters a day.
 Take a look at weather forecasts before you go out. If the weather is expected to have significant wind gusts or temperatures below freezing, plan to minimize your time outside.If temperatures are projected to get below zero Fahrenheit (-17.7 Celsius), try to avoid going out at all when possible.

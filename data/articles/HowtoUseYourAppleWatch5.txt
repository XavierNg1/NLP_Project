 Apple Watch apps are extensions of apps installed on your iPhone, so the only way to add new apps to your watch is to add the corresponding app to your iPhone first.









Open the App Store on your iPhone.
Type "Apple Watch" into the search field.
Browse through the apps that are designed for use with Apple Watch. Once you find an app, you can install it like you would a regular iPhone app.
 Once you've installed an Apple Watch-compatible app, you'll need to enable it to appear on your Apple Watch.









Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.
Tap the "My Watch" tab at the bottom of the screen.
Tap the app in the list that you want to make available on your Apple Watch.
Toggle the "Show App on Apple Watch" slider on.
 "Glances" are Apple Watch screens dedicated to an app. Swiping left and right after opening the Glances screen allows you to switch between them. Your Apple Watch includes several built-in glances, such as weather or music controls.
 Many third-party apps have the ability to add glances:









Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.
Tap the "My Watch" tab at the bottom of the screen.
Tap "Glances." A list of active and available glances will appear.
Tap the "+" next to glances you want to add. You can tap the "-" next to active glances to remove them.
Drag the line buttons on the right side to rearrange the order that glances appear in when you swipe your screen.

 Google can do way more than just search, and with a little trick, can do a search of Craigslist on a nationwide scale.


This method also works with Bing, Yahoo, and other search engines.
 In the search field, enter what you're looking for—whether jobs, merchandise, or love—it's all the same to Google!

, This will focus the search for information on Craigslist and all of its subdomains.
 You can add additional search criteria by using search operators. Some of the most useful for Craigslist include:


Price range – Enter in two prices separated by “..” For example: “Panasonic TV $400..$500 site: craigslist.org” will only return results that list a price in that range.
Zip code – Add a zip code to the end of the search to narrow your results down by location. For example: “Panasonic TV $400..$500 site: craigslist.org 90210” will return results that match the price range and that appear near Beverly Hills, CA.
Exclude words – You can remove words from your search to exclude results that you don’t need. For example: “Panasonic TV $400..$500 site: craigslist.org 90210 -used” will return results that match the price range in Beverly Hills that aren’t used.

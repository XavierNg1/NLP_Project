 The Zoom feature allows you to magnify text, icons, and interface elements at any timeâ€”this is not the same zoom that you use to look at a picture in the Photos app or a web browser. The accessibility function may come in handy if you have trouble reading the screen of your iPhone or iPod. Follow these steps:


Launch the Settings app on your touchscreen Apple device.
Tap General.
Tap Accessibility and scroll to the Vision section.
Tap Zoom.
Turn the Zoom function on by swiping the circular switch to the right. If you wish to turn the function off again, simply return to this screen and swipe the switch to the "Off" position.;
, Two taps will usually zoom in on the tapped area. If you hold down on the second tap, you can pinch or widen your fingers to zoom in or out. Three taps will bring up a menu of special zoom settings.
 The contents of the window are zoomed, but other areas remain their original size. Think of this function like a virtual magnifying glass that acts on a certain area. You can change the size of the window that you wish to zoom.
 The options may include inverted, gray-scale, gray-scale inverted, or low light.
 You can use the controller to move the area on which you are zooming in. When the controller is hidden, you can simply hold your finger near the edge of the touchscreen, and the zoomed version will follow in that direction. There is also a slider in the three-finger triple-tap menu which you can use to manually control the zoom magnification.

 Keep a distance of an inch and half to two inches between each fork.;
, Stretch it, then twist it and hold it in place by securing it to the other fork. This will place the elastic/ rubber band in an X-formation.
 For the sake of this tutorial, and to make things easier, call the band from the previous step the bottom band and this one, the topÂ band.
 Flick it upwards. It should release and rest on the top rubber band. Do the same thing to the other side. You can use tweezers if you so wish.
 Here you are back to the same step again, so keep repeating until you reach the desired length.
 Tie the two ends together using a cut rubber band by looping it through the loose ends, then tying it tightly several times.
 Try it on for size, then it's good to go.

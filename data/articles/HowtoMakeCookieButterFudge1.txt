 Get out an 8 x 8-inch (20 x 20 cm) baking pan and line it with aluminum foil. Spray the foil with cooking spray. This will prevent the fudge from sticking to the pan.Ensure that the foil extends up the sides of the pan. This will give you something to hold onto, so you can lift the fudge up and out of the pan.;
, Measure out 24 ounces (700 g) of white chocolate chips or chunks that you've chopped. Put the chocolate into a medium saucepan with 1 can (14 ounces or 400 g) of sweetened condensed milk and turn the heat on low. Stir the mixture occasionally and melt the chocolate., Once the white chocolate is combined with the sweetened condensed milk, carefully pour the hot mixture into the prepared pan. Use a spoon or offset spatula to smooth the fudge., Put 2 tablespoons of Biscoff (speculoos) spread in a small microwave-safe prep bowl. Heat the cookie butter in the microwave for 5 to 10 seconds. The cookie butter should soften a little. Drop it by small spoonfuls on the fudge in the pan.You can use a teaspoon or very small cookie scoop to spoon the cookie butter onto the fudge.
 Gently drag a large butter knife through the droops of cookie butter on the fudge. As you drag the knife, it should create decorative swirls on the top of the fudge. Put the pan in the fridge and chill it for 30 to 45 minutes, so it sets.You can cut the fudge into 1-inch (2.5 cm) squares before you serve it. Store the leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

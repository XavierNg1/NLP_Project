 If you have severe anemia from a chronic disease, your doctor may recommend blood transfusions. You'll be given healthy blood that matches your own via an IV. This is done to give you a large amount of red blood cells immediately. The transfusion will take between 1 and 4 hours to complete.Depending on the severity of your condition, your doctor may recommend regular blood transfusions.
 If you're getting frequent blood transfusions, your iron levels may build up. High levels of iron can damage your heart and liver, so you'll need to reduce the amount of iron in your body. Your doctor may give you an injection to reduce iron levels or will prescribe a medication.If prescribed a medication, you'll need to dissolve the tablet and drink the solution. Usually, this treatment is needed once a day., The marrow inside your bones contains stem cells, which develop into blood cells that your body needs. If you have anemia caused by a failure of your body to develop functional blood cells (aplastic anemia, thalassemia, or sickle cell anemia), your doctor may suggest a bone marrow transplant. The stems cells will be injected into your bloodstream and from there they'll move to your bone marrow.Once the stem cells reach your bone marrow and graft on, they'll begin to create new blood cells, potentially treating the anemia.

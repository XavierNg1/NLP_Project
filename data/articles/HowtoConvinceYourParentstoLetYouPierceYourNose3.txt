 Instead of arguing with your parents, ask them why they’ve decided to say no. Listen to their reasons without arguing and consider their point of view. For example, if they’re worried that you’re not mature enough to get a piercing, ask them how you can become more mature. Show them that you want to take responsibility and work for what you want.If your parents give you a clear way to improve, do it! By following through, you’re showing them that you’re ready for a piercing.
If this approach doesn’t work let a few months pass before you bring it up again.
 If there’s something your parents have always wanted you to do make a deal with them. For example, if your parents want you to get a summer job, ask them if they’d consider changing their mind after a summer of hard work. By following through you’ll show your parents that you’re mature and dedicated.


When in doubt, suggest a compromise including something that will directly benefit your parents. For example, you could clean out the garage or take out the trash more often.
Don’t suggest an exchange involving chores you already have. If you do those chores without being told, you’re more likely to get what you want anyway., This can be very difficult to do. However, most states in the U.S. don’t allow body piercing on minors without parental consent.If your parents aren’t on board, you’ll have to wait until you’re old enough to do it yourself. Fortunately, this will give you plenty of time to decide whether or not you really want that nose ring.


Never attempt to pierce your own nose. Piercings are extremely vulnerable to infections and should be handled by professionals.Buy a clip-on nose ring if you want to play with the look but can’t get a real piercing.

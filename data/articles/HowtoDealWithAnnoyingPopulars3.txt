 Nothing is permanent, and you might find yourself “unpopular” and a target for bullying one year, then find yourself on the other end of the spectrum later on. Kids in school often switch roles back and forth between bully and victim. Don’t keep the cycle going. Make sure you’re setting a good example and not being a bully, regardless of whether or not people think of you as popular. , If you see someone getting excluded or bullied, reach out and defend them. Sit next to people at lunch who have no one else to sit with, and befriend those who feel like no one wants to be their friend. It’s true that there’s safety in numbers, but even more importantly, you’ll make someone feel better about themselves. In turn, that’ll help your self-esteem, too.


Remember that the tables could always turn: you might see someone get targeted one day, and find yourself to be the target the next. Defend someone the way you’d want to be defended.
 Mean, annoying populars bully others because they think that’s what makes them popular.

Work on being a positive example for others, including the bullies. Be the change you want to see. Remember, kids are a lot more likely to be influenced by their peers than by authority figures.Understand that people often bully because they have insecurities, need a sense of control, or countless other complex reasons. It’s important not to judge any book by its cover!

 Most of these sites have copyright compliance officers or other support staff that handle these issues, usually within a couple of days after your request. They may or may not care about the ethics of piracy, but they do want to avoid lawsuits. Approach them in a matter of fact way, rather than accusatory, threatening, or demanding. Take time to vent your emotions privately (typically you may feel fear, rage, grief, and indignation), but do not approach the site itself in that tone. These sites have hundreds of files uploaded daily and do not have staff to verify the individual copyrights, only those that are reported to them.;
, If one of your books is pirated, there’s a chance others will be uploaded as well. Look for the title as well as your name, and be aware that cagey pirates may shorten the title and misspell your name in order to fool the search engines.
 You will need it for the copyright officer and also your own records so that you can go back and check to see if the file has been removed. To have an exact link, send yourself an email with it and cut and paste the link. You can also send yourself a copy of the full page, with the date uploaded and number of copies.
 Look at the top, bottom, or side of the page for the link (often in very small print) that says something like: copyright policy, copyright protection, removal requests, report violations, or report abuse. Read the policy carefully and collect all the needed information.
 Cut and paste a record of all the information requested, or send yourself a blind copy of the email, including the date of the request. Save it. You will need to return to the site in a few days and from time to time to make sure the file has been removed and that no other copies have been uploaded. Pirates are tricky and very determined.
 This is usually on a link on the same page of the site as the file, though the name is usually a screen name. Read the profile and consider sending a message to them. Many are well-meaning but naive people who do not understand that they are passing along stolen material. They might be chagrined and promptly remove all the ebooks they aren’t sure are legitimate. Others are defiant rebels who consider themselves heroes, and you’re better off not triggering their alert system. If you see that the person has uploaded dozens or even hundreds of files, this is clearly a career pirate. Most sites will ban them if you report them with proof of the piracy and will remove all of that offender’s uploads. By reporting them, you aren’t just handling your own problem, you’re doing a favor to other authors the thief has victimized.
 Again, be reasoned and polite, not threatening legal action. They don’t need or want to read about your emotions, and emoting does seem to slow down their response time. What they generally need is proof that you’re the author and copyright owner and that you did not authorize the file. If it was actually copyrighted it through the government copyright office, say so and provide a number if possible. Send yourself a copy of the note also. Here’s a format that generally works well:



For a hardcopy book: “I am _____, the author and copyright owner of ____ published in hardcopy by ______ in (date). A pirated version has been uploaded to your site without my knowledge or permission by _____ (link to the member who uploaded the file). The book appears at this link on your site: _____ and I note that _____ unauthorized free copies have already been downloaded. The book is for sale on my website at _____ (or the publishers website or on Amazon.com). Let’s work together to get this file removed. You may write to me at ____.

For an ebook: “I am _____, the author and copyright owner of the ebook _____ published by _____. A pirated version has been uploaded to your site without my knowledge or permission by ____(link to the member who uploaded the file). The ebook appears at this link on your site: ____ and I note that ____ unauthorized free copies have already been downloaded. The book is for sale on my website at ____ (or other site where the book is sold on the web). Let’s work together to get this file removed. You may write to me at _____.
 Go back to the site in a few days to see if the file has been removed, and also use the site’s search engine to make sure it hasn’t been reloaded by someone else or the same person with a new screen name. If it hasn’t been removed in a week, write to the copyright officer again with the original date and information. Ask if there’s anything else they need from you as proof of your claim, and again, say, “Let’s work together to remove this file.” Bookmark and revisit the site again periodically.

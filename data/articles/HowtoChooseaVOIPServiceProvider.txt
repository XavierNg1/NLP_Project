 Make sure that any service provider that you're considering has at least a 30 day guarantee. If they don't offer a guarantee then don't even consider them. All of the major providers offer a solid guarantee. Be sure you understand the contract term and know how long you are committingÂ  yourself too. Watch out for "FREE" ploys which lock you into a long term contract or charge you for the equipment when you cancel service. No contracts required for some service provides.
 Most phone companies will offer a "metered service" that you will pay for per call. Since you're going to be using VOIP, you will not be making many (if any) calls over your copper line, only running DSL over it. It's really essential to look into metered service if you're using DSL. After all, why would you want to pay for a standard line if you're going to be paying for VOIP?

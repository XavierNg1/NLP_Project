 You can measure the amount of water different plants take in through their roots, or the effect of sunlight on growth. To compliment this, you could simultaneously study photosynthesis (the process by which plants make food). You can also investigate how different liquids affect plant growth., You will need a petri dish full of agar gel. You can buy these, or mix your own agar. Take a cotton swab and swab a surface that you want to test. Then, roll the swab on the surface of the agar. Cover the petri dish and let the bacteria grow in a dark place that is warm (98 °F (37 °C))., Animal and plant cells are large enough to study under a microscope. Allow the class to look through the microscope and analyze the differences between these two types of cells (e.g. plant cells have cell wall and animal cells do not). As they study the cells, have them draw each cell as they see it under the microscope.

 Place the wet dryer sheets on the areas of the dryer that have traces of the sticking gum. They should stick to the gum area. But if they don’t, you’ll have to hold the dryer sheet on the affected areas., So, if you are holding the drying sheets, you’ll have to hold them on the area for 15 minutes. Holding them on the area gives them time to loosen the gum. Eventually, you should see the gum sticking to the dryer sheet, and in extreme cases you may need to hold it there for longer than 15 minutes.
 Once the gum residue starts to loosen, use the dryer sheet to wipe the gum off. Rub and scrub, if necessary, with the dryer sheet until the gum is completely removed.Then, wipe the drum down with a wet rag.

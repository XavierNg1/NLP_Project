 If you are unsure of the settings on your toaster, try turning the dial to the medium, or middle setting. That way if your bread is a little under-toasted, you can pop it back in at the lowest setting to crisp it up.The drier the toast, the better. You will be adding moisture back into the bread when you microwave it with the the cheese and butter. Too much moisture can make your sandwich soggy., You can butter both sides, but you run the risk of adding too much moisture and ending up with a steamed, soft sandwich., The dry, unbuttered side of the bread should be touching the cheese, with the buttered side on the outside. Two slices of cheese at about 3/4oz (or about 1.5oz total) is usually plenty of cheese.Make sure the cheese is evenly distributed across the bread so it melts evenly. You can tear slices into smaller pieces to make them fit.
Don't pile your sandwich too high with extras. Microwave heat can't penetrate very deep--only about 1-1 1/2 inches--so a fat sandwich may not heat all the way through and your cheese might not melt., The paper towel will absorb the excess moisture, keeping your bread from getting too soggy.Don't wrap the sandwich in plastic wrap, as this traps moisture instead of absorbing it., If you see the cheese begin to drip out of the sides, the sandwich should be done.


You can also see if the cheese is melted by trying to lift the top slice of bread. If the cheese is fully melted, the bread will stick together and be difficult to separate.
 This gives the bread time to cool to a crust, plus it makes it safer for you to eat.

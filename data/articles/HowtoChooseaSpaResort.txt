 There are many ways and many budgets that can fit a spa vacation, though generally speaking this is not going to be low-end. There are inexpensive ways to do anything, but the sheer fact the hotel or resort offers spa treatment services suggests it is a luxury hotel. Be aware of this when you are searching on-line for a spa resort.;
, A tropical spa resort, such as one on the beach? Or perhaps in the rural mountains more rustic and away from things where they also offer hiking adventures? The possibilities are endless!

, Now is the time to home in on the exact locale. There is a good chance you have a fabulous spa resort within a 2 hour drive of your home, though the sky is the limit. You can go to as exotic destinations as you can dream. Besides pampering yourself here in the United States you have spa vacations in the Caribbean, Europe, the Greek Islands, Dubai, perhaps Thailand or the Philippines. Want to stay in an ultra high-end luxury spa resort? Try the South Pacific, like Tahiti and Bora Bora.
 If you are seeking rest and relaxation you may want to avoid a "singles resort" known for its party atmosphere. On the same token if you are single you may be disappointed in a place filled with families and little chance of "mingling" with other guests.
 If you are on your honeymoon you might not want to go a place hopping with singles activities. Go to a more romantic spa resort. If you have certain medical needs goals, try the many wellness spa services.
 If your goal is a certain specialty spa treatment you may need to research certain resorts and be prepared to even travel out of country.
 Since these 3 travel resources stay in competition you will need to compare their spa room rates for the same dates.

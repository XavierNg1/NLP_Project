 Add 4 to 5 tablespoons (60 to 75 ml) of almond milk, 2 egg whites, and 1 to 2 tablespoons (13 to 26 g) of coconut oil to a small bowl. Stir the ingredients until they’re fully combined.You can substitute olive oil for the coconut oil if you prefer.
To determine how much almond milk and coconut oil to use, consider the length and thickness of your hair. Longer, coarser hair usually requires more of both.
 Once the mask is mixed up, carefully massage it into your hair. Start at the roots and work it all the way through to the ends. Allow the mask to sit on your hair for at least 20 minutes.Because the mask is on the thin side, it’s a good idea to put a shower cap or plastic wrap over it to prevent drips.
You can sleep with the mask on your hair overnight for a deep conditioning treatment. Just be sure to cover it with the shower cap or plastic wrap to prevent stains on your sheets.
 When you’re ready to remove the mask, rinse it out of your hair with cold water to avoid cooking the egg whites. Follow up with a mild shampoo to remove any remaining residue.It’s important to use a conditioner after you shampoo your hair.
Use this mask one to two times a week to keep your hair smooth and shiny.

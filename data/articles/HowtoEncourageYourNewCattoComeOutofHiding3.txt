 Your cat will have a harder time acclimating if it’s free to explore your entire home. Instead, keep it in your bedroom or a small, quiet room for at least the first two weeks after bringing it home.The room should have a door that closes and should be free of foot traffic. Try to keep your cat away from other people or animals while it gets used to your home.
 Keeping your cat in one room will reduce the likelihood that it’ll get trapped in dangerous hiding spots, but you should still take the time to cat-proof its room. Make sure HVAC ducts are secure, choose a space that doesn’t have a fireplace, and make sure it can’t knock over any furniture or objects.Try to keep your drawers closed, keep it away from appliances like washers or dryers, and keep your closet door closed if you want to keep it off limits.
 Once your cat is comfortable with coming out to explore its room, you can start introducing it to the rest of your home. Since cats are nocturnal, start by leaving the door to its room open at night. If it’s back in its room in the morning, close the door to avoid overwhelming it.If you can’t find your cat after you’ve let it explore the house, put out a fresh can of cat food or treats and give it some time to come out of hiding. If it has a favorite toy that makes noise, give the toy a shake to get your cat’s attention.
Be sure to cat-proof before you let your cat explore the rest of your house. Close doors to limit the area that your cat can explore and potentially hide. Keep a secure screen (or, in a pinch, a piece of plywood) over any fireplaces, be sure your washer and dryer doors are closed, and check for loose HVAC ducts.

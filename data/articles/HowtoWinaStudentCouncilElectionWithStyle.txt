 Remember you can lose!;
, They should be bright and colourful to catch the voters attention.
 It should cover all the issues. Try going around and asking students what they would liked to be changed. Try to incorporate that into your speech. It should be no longer than 2:30 min. long. Make sure you try to use ideas that will capture a lot of peoples' attention. Be honest and do not make hollow promises.
 DO NOT BRIBE! If you do you may be taking away votes instead of gaining. Try buttons, bracelets, stickers, gum and small things like business cards. Do not spend much money on it because you are giving it away for free. Give freely.
 Do not be plastic.
 Memorize it quickly. The audience will love it if you look at them the entire time. Make eye contact.

 You can buy dried unsweetened coconut flakes from the grocery store. Be sure the only ingredient the bag contains is coconut. If you want to start with fresh coconut meat, cut the meat into pieces and use a dehydrator to dry it out over the course of 24 hours.You can use the oven at its lowest temperature to dry coconut meat. Cut it into small chunks, place it on a baking sheet, and cook it at a low temperature for 8 hours, or until its completely dry.
If you're using store-bought coconut, go for the coconut flakes, rather than shredded coconut, which tends to clog the juicer.
 Juice the dried coconut in small batches, since placing a lot of coconut in the juicer will cause it to clog. The juicer will remove the oil and cream from the fiber. Continue processing the coconut until all of the flakes have been run through the juicer.
 The juicer won't be able to extract all of the oil the first time around, so run the coconut flakes through it once more to make sure you get every last drop.
 Wait 24 hours for the coconut cream to settle at the bottom of the jar. The pure coconut oil will rise to the top.
 Once the oil has separated from the cream and solidified, use a spoon to remove it from the first container and place it in a new container. It is now ready to use.

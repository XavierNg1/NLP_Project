 Yes, you heard right: hairspray. It may not be the most glamorous cleaning agent (or it may be glammed-out, depending on your perspective), but some ink incapacitators swear by it. Here's what you do in order to try to remove the stain:


Douse a Q-tip or cotton swab thoroughly in hairspray.
Quickly take the Q-tip and attack the spot of the foul.
Apply leather cleaner and conditioner to the spot of the foul afterwards. Because hairspray can dry out leather, causing it to begin cracking, it's important to treat the leather after using this method.
Repeat until the ink stain is removed.
 70% isopropyl alcohol has worked for some leather owners in the past, although it's probably not a preferred method.Soak a Q-tip or cotton swab with a bit of rubbing alcohol before rubbing it on to the stained leather item. Because alcohol is also a drying agent, be sure to couple this approach with leather cleaner and conditioner afterward. Repeat if necessary.
 Dampen the tip of a magic eraser and then rub it into the stain. Magic erasers contain a material called melamine foam, which helps remove tricky stains.Finish routine by applying a leather conditioner to the spot using a clean towel.
 Some people have succeed at removing ink stains with the help of non acetone-based nail polish removers.Dab a little on a Q-Tip, rub the Q-tip against the stain, and finish with a nice bit of leather cleaner and conditioner to keep the leather from unnecessarily drying out.

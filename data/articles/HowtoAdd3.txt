 When you have a decimal in a number (for example, 24.5), you'll have to be a little more careful when adding in columns. The main trick is to line up all the numbers using the decimal. The decimals need to be in their own column. For example: 107.8 + 24.5 + 3.2 + 15 should be rewritten to line them up.


107.8
_24.5
__3.2
_15.0

, If a number doesn't have a decimal point, add one and put zeros to the right of it, to help keep your number columns straight.


In the above example, the 15 did not have the zero after it, so it was added to make the columns easier to see.
 Once you have your numbers lined up, you just add them together as you normally would.


The sum for this example would be 150.5 (or if that is dollars $150.50 if you prefer because in the place value system .5 = 5 dimes or tenths of a dollar and .50 = 50 cents or hundredths of a dollar and 5/10 = 50/100 because each is in the ratio of 1 to 2 which equals 1/2 of a dollar).

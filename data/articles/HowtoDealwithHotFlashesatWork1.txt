 Hot flashes can come at any time and last anywhere from a few minutes to an hour. To ensure you are prepared for a sudden change in your body temperature, you should opt for clothing that is breathable and loose fitting. Look for clothing that has “wicking” or “cooling” on the label. Go for clothing in fabrics like linen or cotton and avoid synthetic materials like polyester or nylon.For example, you may wear tops and dresses made of linen that are flowing and loose fitting. Or you may wear loose cotton sweaters and cotton dress pants so you do not get too hot during a hot flash.;
, Hot flashes can also cause you to feel hot one moment and then chilly or cold the next moment. To help regulate your body temperature when you have hot flashes, dress in layers. This way, you can shed a layer when you feel hot and put a layer back on when you feel chilled or cold. You may plan your outfits around layering so you can shed a layer and still look professional at work.For example, you may wear a nice cotton top with a pair of cotton dress pants and then also put on a nice cotton sweater that you can shed if you get too hot. Or you may wear a linen dress with a cotton blazer that you can take off if you get hot during a meeting at work.
 Sometimes you are not able to shed enough clothing at work to feel comfortable and you may end up sweating in your clothing. If you are worried about appearing unprofessional at work after a hot flash, you may keep a clothing in a desk drawer that you can change into in the bathroom. This way, you can still look put together at your meeting later in the day, with no sweat lines to be seen.


For example, you may store a more professional outfit at your desk, such as a clean cotton collared top and dress pants, as well as a more casual outfit, such as a cotton sweater and loose pants. Then, you can change into either outfit depending on what you are doing that day at work.

 Look and see if you have any albums missing, if so Google the artist, Wikipedia usually has the complete discography, and fix your albums with proper capitalization. This is key!;
, This can be challenging at first but after you get the hang of it it is easy and moves quickly, simply copy and paste the album title into Google images. A wide variety should pop up, if not, keep searching. Some other sources are Myspace Music, Wikipedia, and Yahoo. To make sure you have the albums correctly placed in the information of your library, click the 3rd view tab on your iTunes window. The albums may take a minute to load but they will pop up. (iTunes can also do this for you, but it may be unable to find albums or choose random soundtracks.)





, Make the most important words in titles and band names capitalized. If this is not done, your library will be messy and far from perfect.
 The playlists can vary from events to genres to times of the day (see more below).
 Make sure all of your albums, band names and songs are accurate. Some music downloading services like Limewire are not correct. It takes work but to get it right is all that matters.

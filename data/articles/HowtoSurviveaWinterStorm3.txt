 Some storms arrive suddenly, but usually the local weather team can give you some warning that there is a chance of a storm. In addition, during a storm, the radio can give you information on storm intensity, storm tracking and other emergency information.
 Make sure you have enough supplies to last at least a week. Ensure your first-aid kit is well stocked. Have plenty of extra sheets and blankets available.


Get plenty of candles and matches. When the power goes out, you will need to have light to see. Be sure you have extra batteries. Always use caution when using candles.
Purchase self-powered radios and flashlights. Some of these models will also charge your cell phone. Also purchase light sticks as well.
Make sure you have water. Cleaning, then filling the bathtub is a good way to store water. You can quickly pour water directly into the toilet bowl to flush it. If bad comes to worse, you can melt snow to get water.
 This will prevent water from freezing in the pipes and rupturing them, thereby avoiding future expensive damage., Have a fireplace, wood stove, or kerosene heater available to keep you warm. You could also buy a generator for backup electricity. Be sure you know how to use these sources safely, and have appropriate fuel at hand. Be careful to conserve energy if you're anticipating a long power outage.

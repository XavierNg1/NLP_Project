 Items that are dry-clean only can be spruced up using baking soda. While it won't actually clean the clothes, it will absorb musty smells and make your clothes smell fresh.


Cover the item with a light layer of baking soda, then place it in a sealed bag. You can use a flour sifter to evenly distribute the baking soda.
If you'd rather not get baking soda on your clothes, pour baking soda into a clean sock. Tie off the open end of the sock. Place the sock in a bag with the baking soda and seal it.
 It may take awhile for the baking soda to completely absorb the musty smell. Place the bag and baking soda in a cool, dry place to sit overnight., Open the bag and shake off the baking soda. Use a soft brush to remove excess baking soda if necessary. Hang up the item of clothing in the sun. Let it stay outside and blow in the breeze for a few hours to finish airing out.
 Strong smells may require you to treat the clothing more than once. Repeat the process of sprinkling the item with baking soda, letting it sit, and airing out the clothing. If it still smells musty, you may need to have it professionally cleaned.

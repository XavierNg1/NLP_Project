 If a guy likes you and you’re in conversation, he might ask you a bunch of questions. If he’s smooth, then you may not even notice it. He’s fishing for a similar interest that you two can share.Embrace a common interest if he becomes excited. Ask him questions in return to see if he is a phony or not.
 Sometimes men will change their tone of voice depending on who they talk to. Listen to him in a group with his guy friends. Then see if he talks the same way to you when you’re alone. If he does talk the same, it doesn’t necessarily mean he isn’t into you. His voice should soften ever so slightly., Some people naturally mumble. When guys like someone and they’re prone to mumble, you might hear it. This is more characteristic of a shy guy.


If you’re in this scenario and want him to relax, rest your hand on his shoulder or his upper forearm.
 A lot of times if you both like each other, it doesn’t matter what you talk about. Two people who like each other can go on and on about the most mundane topics. Think back on your conversations. Recall if the subject matter was bleak, but your body chemistry is excited.
 If this guy likes you and you like him, try calling him on the phone. Why wait for the guy to initiate things. Take control and call him. See if the conversation moves naturally.


Some people aren’t phone people, but you can sometimes tell if they’re trying to make an effort.

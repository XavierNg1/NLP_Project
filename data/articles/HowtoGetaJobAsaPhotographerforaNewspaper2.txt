 Start a business as a freelancer to work with several different publications as an independent contractor, which is the more common practice as more and more staff photographers are being cut from declining print newspapers. As a freelancer, you’ll need to have a good knowledge of business and be able to adapt to different newspaper styles.


To be a full-time freelance photographer, you need to have business skills like client relations, marketing, advertising, and accounting because you’ll run your own business. Consider taking a business class if you don’t have these skills already., Keep your eye on local classifieds in the newspaper or online for open photojournalism positions, whether full-time or contract.
 Make connections with photojournalists and others in the industry through school, clubs or other groups. Bring them your photos, ideally with captions or a short and compelling news story. Ask for their advice and critiques. They may also be able to tell you about new opportunities or even offer you an available position if they like your work.

 Do not get dressed or undressed in front of your baby. Avoid bathing with your baby. If your baby sees your breast, he will be reminded of what they offer and will likely make an attempt to nurse.
 Refrain from holding your baby in the position that was generally used to nurse him. Positioning differently can be useful in distracting your baby from his desire to nurse.
 Avoid sitting in the usual chair that you nursed your baby in and avoid taking your baby into the room that was routinely used to nurse in. Switch up as many routines as you can that may trigger your baby to desire a nursing session.

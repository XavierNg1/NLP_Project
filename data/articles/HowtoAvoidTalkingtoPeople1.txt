 Fake a phone call or appear to be texting when someone approaches you for a social conversation. Pretending to be in the middle of communicating with someone else will deter others from engaging in conversation without being rude.Try to simulate the phone call or text as best as possible. Avoid eye-contact, pace back and forth, or quickly let the individual you are on a very important call or need to finish an urgent text.
If you are in the middle of an unwanted or awkward conversation, politely say that you need to take a call and step out.;
, Have a few different excuses prepared so that if you are caught in passing or approached unexpectedly you can quickly derail a conversation before it begins.


Saying that you need to run and catch a train is a great and polite excuse to keep moving.
Other excuses, like saying you are late for another appointment or have forgotten something at work are both broad and maintain a sense of urgency.
Enlist the help of friends. If you happen to be in an obligatory social setting have a friend call or text you with information that needs immediate attention.
Say that you have conflicting plans if you are invited to a social gathering.
 Carrying a book or magazine in your bag will allow you to appear occupied when sitting alone or on public transportation. Not only will you appear busy and unavailable for conversation, but youâ€™ll also positively engage in another activity.
 Wearing headphones in public often gives the appearance of being unapproachable. Keeping your headphones on is an efficient and polite way to communicate your unavailability.


Plug your headphones into your mobile phone or mp3 player and put on your favorite album.
Download and listen to a new podcast or audiobook.
 Staying home, when possible, is a certain way to avoid conversations that you have no desire to participate in.


Stay home and watch a film, read, cook, or listen to music.

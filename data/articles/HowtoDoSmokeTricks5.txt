 The more soap you have to water, the better. This is basically bubble fluid, so you want it to be liquidy but still full of soap.


Start with 1/2 cup of water and a 2-second squirt of soap, then adjust accordingly., Again, this is similar to dipping a bubble wand in some children's bubble mix. Leave the end of the straw in the liquid as you inhale some smoke.
 Inhale as much smoke as you can from your chosen device. The more smoke, the bigger your bubble.
 Make sure that you exhale slowly, building the bubble so it doesn't pop on you. Pull the straw off when you're done to close off your bubble.Don't inhale with the straw at your lips or you risk inhaling a big bunch of soap.

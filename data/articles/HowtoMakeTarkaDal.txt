 Put 300g of red dal into a sieve, and rinse with cold water under a tap, until the water runs almost clear.


Bring 850ml of water to the boil in a non-stick pan, and add the lentils.






Immediately, add a teaspoon of turmeric and 1/4 teaspoon of ground coriander. Stir, then leave to bubble gently for 15 to 20 minutes, until the lentils are soft, and the water is frothy. Stir occasionally.

, Cut the ends off a medium onion, and chop finely. Crush 2 cloves of garlic, remove the skin, and chop them finely.
 Over a medium heat, melt 30g of butter in a non-stick frying pan. Then, add 1/4 teaspoon of cumin seeds, and about a 1/4 teaspoon of asafoetida.
 Add the chopped onion and garlic to the frying pan, and fry until the onion starts to brown. This will take about 6 minutes.
 Sprinkle in 1/4 teaspoon of chilli powder and desired amount of salt. Keep stirring.
 Add the boiled lentils to the pan and keep frying for another 3-4 minutes. The lentils will absorb the flavours of the butter and spices.
 Add half a teaspoon of Garam Masala, and stir. Take the pan off the heat.
 Top the dal with a knob of butter, and scatter some fresh chopped coriander leaves to garnish.

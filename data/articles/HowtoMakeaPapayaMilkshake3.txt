 Put 1 cup of diced papaya (per serving) into a blender with about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of honey. This may improve the consistency of the papaya extract before you add milk. Blend until the papaya is thoroughly blended and juiced.
 You can always add more milk to adjust the consistency later. If you are supplementing or replacing the milk with ice cream or yogurt, you can add that now as well.
 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of honey, sugar, or another sweetener should do the trick. If you aren't sure how sweet you want your milkshake, leave out the honey/sugar until after you've blended all of the other ingredients. You can always add more of any ingredient to tweak the taste.
 Consider adding 1 1/2 of vanilla extract for a sweeter shake, or a pinch of black pepper for a spicier shake. If you aren't sure, you can always add extra seasonings after you've blended and tasted the basic shake.
 Blend all the ingredients for 1-2 minutes, or until the milkshake reaches a smooth consistency. Stop blending when you like the texture., If you are adding ice cubes, add them once the milkshake becomes a puree, then blend for another 30 seconds. This will ensure that the ice cubes blend into the shake, but not so much that they lose their texture., You can drink the shake as it is, or you can choose to add more ingredients to tweak the taste of the shake.


If the shake isn't sweet enough, you can add honey, sugar, or ice cream to taste. If you are using a sweet variety of papaya, then you may just choose to add more papaya.
If the shake is too sweet, you can add ice cubes, or milk to dilute the shake. Consider adding black pepper, if you haven't already, for a spicy twist.
If the shake is too thick, you can add more milk to loosen the consistency.
If the shake is too thin, you can add ice cubes, ice cream, or more papaya to thicken it up.

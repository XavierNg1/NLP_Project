 If problems are happening primarily at home, it might be because your child wants your attention and is expressing this desire in an annoying way. Set aside some time each day just for your child. Read a book together, play a game, or do an activity that’s special just for you two.Let your child know that you’re attentive to them. Put away your phone and laptop and spend some quality time just the two of you.
Keep in mind that kids may misbehave due to a lack of attention. Bad attention is still a form of attention.
 Some kids may have pent-up energy when they come home from school and go crazy in the house. Give your children an outlet for stress that helps them and keeps them safe. For example, let them jump on a trampoline for 15 minutes after school. Teach your child to use deep breathing to help calm them down.Enroll your child in kids yoga or meditation classes to help them cope with stress in a calm and relaxing way.
 Let your child know that they can talk to you about any problems they are having. Create safety for them by showing them love and being close to them. Show that you care and that they matter. Listen to your child speak and respond lovingly and in a supportive manner.Don’t laugh at your child or talk down to them.
Children may feel uncomfortable if asked about their problems. Ask a positive question, such as, “What’s one thing you’d do to make school more the way you wanted?” or, “What kinds of things do you notice in kids you want to be friends with?”

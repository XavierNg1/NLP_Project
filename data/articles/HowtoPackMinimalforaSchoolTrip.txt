 If it is a three day trip, bring four outfits. In case something happens, you'll need it. You should wear tall socks (mid-shin length), leggings in a dark color (black, brown, or navy blue), a simple tee-shirt or tank top, a pair of sneakers, and a fuzzy jacket or sweat-shirt. Even in if is in the spring or summer, you won't regret bringing this! You will also want to bring a few hair-elastics, a dark colored headband, and a brush/comb.;
, You'll regret it if it gets dirty or lost. Remember, ONLY PACK WHAT YOU WILL NEED!

, Bring some tinted lotion, waterproof mascara, and lip-balm.
 Only bring an iPod or nothing. Only bring things that are allowed, or else they may get taken away until the trip is over.
 You can play these with friends at night.
 Fold your clothes(or roll them if they crinkle)and put it neatly in your suitcase. Put toiletries in one bag, so you won't be searching all over for them. Bring some "supplies" even if you haven't started yet, better safe than sorry! (and if someone else starts, you can let them borrow some)

, Stuff like a day-pack (small backpack), a refillable water bottle, toothpaste, mouthwash and toothbrush, travel soap, deodorant, towel and hand rag, 4 pair of underwear and 2 bras (alternate each day), and a foldable raincoat/poncho.
 So bring a sleeping bag and small pillow so you stay warm at night. For pajamas, it is recommend that you bring a pair of cropped pajama pants and a plain tee-shirt. If you are planning on taking a shower, wear some waterproof flip-flops in the shower.

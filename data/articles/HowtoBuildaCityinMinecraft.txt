 Usually people prefer the Superflat biome and the terrain, as the name suggests, is flat. However, some people prefer to build in other biomes (Forest, Hills, etc...) to give the city a more natural look. Keep in mind that terrains except for Superflat may need moderate to heavy terraforming.
 Since houses of any city conventionally need to be built one a single level, or in other words, the base of the house needs to be plain, it is essential to terraform the terrain. Terraforming can be on a large scale (for the whole city/block) or on an individual, per-house scale. Apart from from making building convenient, terraforming also carries an aesthetic value if done properly. (Note: Terraforming can also cover up naturally spawned water bodies which may hinder the construction.)
, Plan out how you intend to go about it. Town planning is a tiresome yet exciting job. You could plan anything, from where to build what, to the size of the roads. The most convenient way to plan is building the roads first and then laying the foundations of houses. It gives you quite an idea about how the city will look when completed. What's more, you could add your own creativity (how about a subway system?).You are your own master!
, After you know what exactly you have to build, bring it to life! A good city may even take months to build. After and during construction, make sure you regularly save your world in a backup storage device. You definitely don't want to lose it all accidentally! (Skydrive may also be convenient, as world saves are hardly a few Kbs in size.)
, Add a few pictures and modifications in each building, and spawn Villagers with the help of Spawn Eggs. Make it alive!
, Sword will not damage your structures. The last thing you want is accidentally breaking your own creations.

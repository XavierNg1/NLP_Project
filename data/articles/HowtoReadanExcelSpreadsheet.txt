 In order to do this, you'll need to do the following two actions:


Consider the purposes of a spreadsheet:

to inform of a current condition, status
to provide a basis for interpretation: observation, argument


Be aware of the spreadsheet production process. That is, have some knowledge of how a spreadsheet is made.

the creation stage involves research, collection, and input of data.
the release stage already consists of selecting a medium and mode of transportation.

;
, This is will be a three step process, as outlined:


You will not be able to classify the data sheet into the following three variable forms:

a cell, which contains a single data figure
a column, which is a vertical group of cells
a row, which is a horizontal group of cells


Find the meaning of each cell in relation to its column and row. A spreadsheet is the combination of presentation and information, where each cell will convey a value, in relation to an object and attribute.

a cell is the value of the relationship between an object and attribute
a column refers to an object
a row refers to an attribute


Finally, observe the significance of each variable by compare and contrast.
 In other words, understand how the spreadsheet is relevant for you. Investigate the production process, in terms of the people (participants), the reason for the involvement (motivation), and also the situational relevance (date and location). You can use the following as a reference:


participants: individual, group, teacher, company
motivation: work, school, hobby, research
date: creation, update, version
location: availability

, To fully utilize a spreadsheet, you will use the information and presentation to form an argument or a judgment based on what you have studied.

 Navigate to www.expensify.com using any browser on your computer, and log in using your e-mail address and password.
 Click the “Admin” link placed in the top menu. Then select the “Policies” option from the left pane of the screen. You should already have at least one policy created—your Primary Expense Policy.


If you have not yet created an expense policy, click the “Create Policy” button from the current screen, next to one of the “Team” or “Corporate” options. Then fill in all pages/fields of the New Policy wizard.
The New Policy wizard has 12 steps listed on the left pane of the screen: Basics, Connections, Categories, etc. Each of the steps defines some basic rules and settings for the current expense policy.
 Once you're on the Policies screen, click on the account's primary policy’s title in the list. You will be taken to the Basics screen of the current policy, where you can edit the policy's currency in the “Output Currency” field. Just click the arrow in the drop-down in order to select a new currency.


After selecting the new default currency, changes are saved automatically.

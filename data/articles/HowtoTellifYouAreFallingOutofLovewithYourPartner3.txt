 When you are in love with someone, you can’t help but become excited when thinking about the future. Typically, you would want it to involve them. If you look towards the future but don’t see your partner in it, there’s a chance you aren’t in love anymore.


You may also find yourself changing the subject when your partner talks about your future together. You might avoid questions they have about your future or think about backing out of plans you have always talked about, such as having children or buying a home together., When you spend time with loving couples, are you jealous of the partnership they have? Would you rather spend time anywhere else but in their company? If being around two people who love each other makes you uneasy, it may be because you aren’t in love with your partner anymore., In the initial stages of your partnership, you may have found yourself working hard to resolve any problems or issues that arose in your relationship. Now, however, you may just not care anymore. Not working towards making the problems right is a sign that you aren’t committed to or engaged in your relationship anymore.


Similarly, you may find yourself just ignoring problems that you would have tried to solve before. You may not feel the relationship is worth the effort, or you may simply no longer care., Do you feel like you have to force yourself to say those three little, but powerful, words? If so, there’s a good chance you simply aren’t in love anymore.


The same thing goes for when your partner says they love you. Hearing the words may make you feel uncomfortable or even guilty. And if you only say it because you feel obligated to, you may be ready to leave the relationship.

 It might be your favorite toy or some other toy.
 Choose toys of varying sizes and types. You can mix up dolls and stuffed animals, they won't mind.
 Choose food from your doll or toy miniature food collection, if you have such items. Otherwise, you could cut out magazine pictures of food or print some off––ask your parents for help.
 Use a little table if you have one. If you don't have one, make one from a box turned upside down, with a cloth thrown over it to look like a tablecloth.
 Put out plastic/toy teacups, a tea set and any other things you want for the tea party.


You can make plates from clay or play dough if you don't have any. Or, ask a parent for plastic plates or disposable plates.
 Maybe add a balloon, some colorful streamers and a vase of flowers.
 How do your guests travel? By flying, horse-drawn carriage, car or on foot? It's up to you!

, Have fun with the toys, making sure they all get something to eat and drink and have a good chat with each other.

 Get buildings organized, soldiers and or gatherers in place, basically get as much done as possible in the first three minutes of the game. In war- based games, you will want to get a recon team or aircraft to scope out enemy positions, and see what kind of army they are preparing, so you can counterattack with the perfect units. Say they have light tanks, then you get Anti-Tank and heavy tank units. In resource gathering scenarios, start building your army while gathering resources.This will speed up your Army-building process dramatically.;
, If there is a local hill that your foe doesn't know about, go ahead and put a watchtower or turret there. It also pays off to have some engineers or builders with your army. They can build structures to attack your enemy and guard the place after the soldiers have moved on.
 Then send in the rest of your forces to blow the living **** out of them!

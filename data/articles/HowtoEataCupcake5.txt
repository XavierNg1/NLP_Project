 Grasp the cupcake with your dominant hand, gripping the sides lightly but securely between your thumb and forefinger.


This is the classic cupcake-eating method. It can be fairly messy, but it maintains the look of the cupcake for as long as possible and works with filled and non-filled cupcakes alike.
 Bring the cupcake up to your mouth and take bites out of it directly.


Wipe away any frosting that gets on your nose your cheeks as you eat.

 An aquarium of smaller size such as a 10 gallon (37.9 L), is better off with a dwarf breed of catfish (such as Corydoras hasbrosus). Panda Cory's also work well in a smaller tank setting. Larger tanks, can hold larger breeds of corydoras such as Upside-down Catfish or Bronze corydoras (Corydoras aeneus). A catfish breed such as Synodontis Multipunctatus Catfish (not a corydoras) need a minimum tank size of 50 gallons (189.3 L).;
, Different species of catfish prefer different temperatures. Hasbrosus corydoras prefer a temperature of 73–79 °F (23–26 °C), but can withstand temperatures from 68-85 degrees.
 The catfish should be able to have dark hiding spot where other fish won't bother him/her. Having decorations such as a cave will be appreciated by the catfish.
 Catfish eat algae and uneaten food from other fish, but they also eat vegetables and algae wafers.
 Most catfish survive better if they are in schools of 4-6+. If you have a smaller (less than 20 gallon tank) and you want to have more than one or two corydoras, you should probably choose a dwarf breed.
 Sites like http://www.planetcatfish.com/catelog/ provide a long list of many types of catfish and provide all the information on aquarium size and temperature.


You may also need to check your local pet/aquarium store to see which breeds they have in stock.

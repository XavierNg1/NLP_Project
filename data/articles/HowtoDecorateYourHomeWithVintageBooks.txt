 Not all books have to stand upright on a bookshelf.


Stack 2 or 3 books on a chair.
Display a book on your coffee table. A beautiful leather-bound book with gilded page edges is an elegant decorative touch.
Stack vintage cookbooks on top of a cupboard or sideboard.
Put a few books on your stair landing (if there is enough room so that they donâ€™t become a tripping hazard)
Place a few books on a bathroom table or shelf if your bathroom is well-ventilated and the books are not valuable.;
,, Put books of the same color on a bookshelf and accent it with a decorative or unusual bookend. For example, shelve 4 or 5 books with purple bindings upright on your bookshelf and place an amethyst crystal or lavender candle at one end to complement the color of the book binding.
 Tie the books together with Jute string or ribbon and stack them on a table.
 The books will be preserved and protected in a climate-controlled environment.
 Place a vase of fresh flowers next to the books.
, You can also place books in unusable spaces, such as a high, recessed alcove.

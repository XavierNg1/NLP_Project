 “Suggest” is the verb form of “suggestion.” When you make a suggestion, you offer an opinion.


The word “suggest” is similar to the word "demand", in that they are both putting forth a request. However, “demand” is a very strong word; when you demand something, you are not giving the person you are talking to much of a choice. You are willing them to do something.
The word “suggest”, on the other hand, is more of a request. You want your idea to be heard, but you are not requiring that it be fulfilled. When you suggest to a group that you go for ice cream, you are hopeful that you will be able to go, but you are open to other thoughts and ideas.
 “Suggest” is a transitive verb. Therefore, a sentence containing the word "suggest" must have a subject, the verb “suggest,” and a direct object.


All sentences must have a subject. A subject is a noun or a pronoun, which is a person, place, thing, or idea. A pronoun stands in for a noun; it is a way of referring to something without saying the same word over and over again. Examples of pronouns include "he", "she", "it" and "they".
All sentences must also have a verb. Whereas the noun or pronoun does the action, the verb is the action; i.e. it tells what the noun is doing.
Some verbs are called transitive verbs, which means they must have a direct object. A direct object is also noun or pronoun. However, this time, the action is happening to the noun, rather than performing the action.

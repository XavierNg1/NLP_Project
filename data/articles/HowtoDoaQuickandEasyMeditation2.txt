 You don't need a lot of time to perform breathing exercises, though you can take as much time as you want. The important thing is to make time for calm, relaxing breathing as soon as you notice yourself feeling tense or anxious.It won't take long for you to feel the effects of deep breathing exercises, though you can continue deep breathing for as long as you'd like.
Try to find a place where you won't be disturbed. If you can't find a quiet place inside, try sitting outside.
 When you're ready to begin, you should get into a comfortable position. You can sit on the floor or in a chair, so long as you can keep a straight posture.Sit up straight, keeping your back and neck aligned.
Close your eyes. This can help block out distractions and promote a state of relaxation.
You may want to put one hand on your belly. This can help you feel your breathing, which can help you recognize whether or not you're breathing deeply.
 Deep breathing is as simple as taking slow, deep, long inhalations and slow, extended exhalations. You can do it for as long or as short as you need to. Any time your mind wanders back to something stressful, simply focus on your breath.Inhale slowly through your nostrils.
Feel your breath travel down into your abdomen to your diaphragm (just below the ribs).
Focus on the sensations of breathing deeply, in and out.
You should be able to feel your belly rise and fall on each breath with your hand. If you don't feel your breath, you may need to take slower, deeper breaths.

 This information can be found on most financial webpages, or on the company's website. Using the company's net earnings or income as the primary number in the calculation is the most basic way of determining EPS.


For example, say you want to calculate the EPS of Microsoft based on its net income. A quick browse of Microsoft's website tells you that in 2012, the company's net income was almost $17 billion.Be careful not to mistake a company's quarterly net income with their annual net income.

Mistaking a company's quarterly net income for their annual net income will cause your calculation to be roughly four times smaller.;
, How many total shares does a company have on the stock exchange? This information can be collected by visiting a financial website and locating the company's information.

Let's say a bocce ball company has a net income of $4 million and 575,000 shares outstanding. We divide $4 million by 575,000 and come up with an EPS of 6.95.

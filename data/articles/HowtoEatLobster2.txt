 Lobster are often served in fine restaurants, but the experience of eating them can get a little messy. Small bits of lobster may fling from your fork as you eat, and you may get drops of butter on your clothing. Bibs are often provided, but you might want to wear something that isn't easily stained just in case.
 It's very difficult to eat lobster without handling the various parts. Expect to touch the lobster's shell, legs, claws, tail, and insides with your fingers. By the end of the meal, you'll be quite familiar with lobster anatomy.
 Lobster is served with the following equipment, used to make the experience of eating it a little easier:


A lobster cracker, which is similar to a nutcracker. Without this, you'd have trouble getting through the lobster's tough shell to reach the meat inside.
A lobster fork, or lobster pick, which is a tiny metal fork used to dig into the lobster's crevices for meat.
A bone dish, used as a receptacle for lobster shells.
Hand wipes are often dispensed after the meal, so you can wipe the lobster juices from your fingers.
 Some people like to eat the lobster part by part, eating the meat from each piece as it is detached from the body. Others prefer to dismantle the entire lobster and enjoy the meat all at once, after the work is out of the way. The choice is yours - both are equally acceptable, etiquette-wise.

 The kennel name is often a made-up word that has some meaning to the breeder, for example, a combination of family names, names of other beloved pets, or names of places they’ve been. Talk to your breeder to find out if your dog has already been dubbed with a kennel name.All of the dogs bred in this family will share the same first name.
You will want to choose a second name for each dog that is unique.
 One common method for choosing an interesting name (or second name) is to think about what was happening the day your dog was born. For example, if your dog was born on Abraham Lincoln’s birthday, you could name him “Lincoln” or “Big Beard” or “Emancipator.”, Another method for selecting a unique name (or second name) is to think about a location. For example, you could use the name of the first street you’ve lived on (e.g., Sacramento, Pulaski, or Milwaukee). Alternatively, you could name the dog after a favorite city, or something that reminds you of that city (e.g. Eiffel Tower, Golden Gate, or Street Performer)., You may be able to come up with an interesting name for your dog by combining the names of past beloved pets. For example, if you had a lovely cat named Sasha, and a sweet bulldog named Fido, you could think about naming your new dog Fisha or Sado.
 Finally, your AKC registered dog will need a last name. Generally, owners tend to use their own last names. If you share this dog with your partner, you will need to decide who’s name you will give to the dog or if you will hyphenate.

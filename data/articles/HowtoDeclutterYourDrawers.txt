 Do what you feel able to deal with. It is never a good idea to upend every drawer in a cabinet, only to lose faith and energy halfway through. You can either stop after doing one drawer, and tackle the next drawer tomorrow, or keep going if you have the time and energy.;
, Everything.
 Clear all junk and debris, then clean with a wet rag or use a cleaning product. Make it nice and clean.
 And toss it.
 Sort:


stuff you’d like to give away. Put this in a box to give away, and put the box in your car to drop off when you’re done;
stuff you want to put in other places in the house (do this immediately after you’re done); and
stuff you want to keep in the drawer. Try to keep related stuff in the drawer — don’t have a junk drawer. Only keep school supplies, or underwear, or whatever, in that drawer, so that you know what belongs there.
 You should have a greatly reduced amount of stuff to put back in the drawer. Don’t have too much stuff, or the drawer will still be cluttered. Put it back neatly, in some kind of order — it helps to get a drawer organizer that fits the stuff you’re putting in there. This is great for office or school supply stuff, like pens and tape and scissors and paper clips.
 Now that it’s nice and neat and de-cluttered and simplified, celebrate. And keep it that way! Never just toss stuff in the drawer. Make sure that it belongs there, and put it back in an orderly manner. This habit might take some time, but it will pay off in less cluttered drawers.

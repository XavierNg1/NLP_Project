 To do so, you can double-click the file itself, or you can open Microsoft Word and then select the file name from the list of recent documents.
 Highlighting by selecting allows you to click and drag across text to highlight it as you go, but to activate it, you can't have any text currently selected.
 It's a pencil icon with a yellow bar beneath it and "ab" next to it. You'll find it in the toolbar near the top of the Word window, though you may first have to click the Home tab in the top-left side of the Word window. After clicking the "Highlight" button, your mouse cursor will display a pencil next to it.
 Doing so will select it; when you release the mouse button, your text will be highlighted in the highlighter's default color.


You can change the highlighter's color by clicking the downward-facing arrow right of the "Highlight" button and then selecting a different color.

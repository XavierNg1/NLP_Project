 You must purchase one male and one female finch in order for them to breed. To distinguish males from females, observe the finches. Male zebra finches have red markings on their cheeks whilst females do not.

The pair of finches must be at least six to nine months old and in good condition to be able to breed. Remember, you don't want to inbreed because it often leads to unhealthy chicks so make sure the pair of finches you choose are in no way related to each other.
Finches can be bought from a pet shop, online, or from a reliable breeder. You should choose a pair of finches that are alert, active and making some noise.
 Since the finches will be hard at work caring and feeding their baby chicks you must make sure they are getting a proper diet. The female finch should also get some source of calcium such as crushed oyster shells or cuttle bone. The usual finch diet is good for your breeding pair. Finch seed mixtures can be found in most pet shops and grocery shops.
 Don't hide the finches away in a shed or garage, instead make sure they get plenty of sunlight. Around 14 to 16 hours of sunlight a day is needed., The finches will build their nest, start breeding, lay their eggs and sit on them. All you have to do now is wait and leave the finches undisturbed. Remember, continue caring for them properly to make sure they are happy and healthy.

After the finches sit on the eggs it will take them about 14 to 16 days to hatch so be patient. If the eggs show no signs of hatching after the 20th day you must discard them.
 The chicks are very fragile, don't handle them unless necessary. You may cause stress upon the parents.

Zebra finches make great parents and will care for the chicks themselves. Caring for the chicks is not necessary but you must provide the food and water. When the baby finches are six weeks old you must separate them from their parents or the parents will peck at them.

 When you are finished with your session, put on your robe and return to your private changing area and put on your clothes.


Make sure you don't leave anything in the studio.
You should wear comfortable clothes.
It is a good idea to have a bag for your dirty robe or towel so you can wash these after your session.
 You will want to discuss any further sessions at this time. Have your date book and pen handy when you come out of the change room in case the artist would like to work with you again.
It's also a good idea to prepare a business card to hand to the artist.
Ask for feedback from the artist.
Once you've worked with the artist a few times, you can even ask for a letter of recommendation that you can use to help you find future work.
 You want to show initiative and enthusiasm if you want to be hired again. Call or email to confirm a time and date for your next session.
If you don't book another session right away, contact the artist in a few weeks after your session to see if they need any more models.
Ask your artist for other contacts if you have developed a good working relationship.

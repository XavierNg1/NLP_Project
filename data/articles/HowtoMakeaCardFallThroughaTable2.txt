 Take the card from the bottom of the deck and flip it over so that it is facing up. Place it back on the bottom of the deck.Be sure not to do this while anyone else is around or you will reveal your secret.
 Put the card face down on the bottom of the deck, so it’s underneath the card you turned over.


The card you turned over will serve as a marker so you know where your friend’s card is.
 Push down on it with one finger and blow on it, pretending you are pushing the card through to the other side of the table.The card has now, presumably, fallen through the table.
You can make it seem strenuous, as though it takes a lot of effort to push it through to the other side.
Ask your friend to help you blow on the deck to gain more momentum.
 Show your friend that his card is not in the deck. Add each section to the bottom of the deck, facing up.


When you reach the card you turned over at the beginning, stop. You know your friend’s card is right below it.Now, all the cards, except your friend’s card, are facing up. It looks like you’ve gone through the entire deck and his card isn’t there.
 Place the deck on the table. Knock on the table to pretend like you’re getting the card back from the other side of the table.Play up this moment by acting nervous, like you hope it will come back from the other side.
 Fan out the deck, face up on the table. There will be one card face down.


Tell your friend to pick up the card that is face down. He’ll flip it over and see that it’s his card!

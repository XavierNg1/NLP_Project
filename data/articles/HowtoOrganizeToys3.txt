 Make a rule to clean up every day. If you let a mess go on too long, your organizational structure will fall apart fast. Designate a certain time every 24 hours to clean.Select a time and be firm about it. For example, have your kids clean up every night half an hour after dinner.
In addition to putting away toys, target other messes. Throw away things like napkins, wrappers, and other junk that's been left around the house.
 This rule will assure that your home does not become messy during the day. Before a child removes a new toy, make sure they have put the old one back in its proper place. This will keep your organizational structure intact and make cleanup easier.Be gentle when reminding your children of this rule. Do not yell, but say something like, "Hey, are your Legos away? You need to put them away before you take out your dolls."
Acknowledge you hear your child's complaints instead of scolding or dismissing them. This makes your child more likely to cooperate. Say something like, "I know you think putting away your stuffed animals will take forever, but it will make things so much easier later."

, If there's a big mess, take it one step at a time. Focus on one type of toy first. For example, have your kids pick up all the stuffed animals, then all the all the actions figures, and so on. This will make cleaning up the mess feel more manageable., If your children dislike cleaning up, strive to make it feel like less of a chore. You can play upbeat music during clean up or turn it into a game.Try a competition if you have multiple children. You can have them try to see who can clean up the most toys in 3 minutes.
If you only have one child, you can have them see how many toys they can put away in three minutes. Then, have them try to break that record.

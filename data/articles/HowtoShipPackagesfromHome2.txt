 Do this in the same way you would normally ship a box from home with the post office. Insert your item(s) in a suitable box and pad the items well with things like newspaper, packing peanuts, and bubble wrap. Then take the measurements of your box.


Depending on the company, the information you have to provide for your package may vary. Generally, length, width, height, and weight are necessary to ship a package.
 Go to the homepage of the company you are planning to use to ship your package. Select the "Schedule a Pickup" option and input the necessary information to calculate postage and shipping details. Then:


Double check the shipping and return addresses.
Verify the label policy. You may need to use a special label provided by the company, which you may have to order by mail or pick up from a brick and mortar location, or you may be able to pay with a card and print one.Choose a time for pickup., Seal your package with tape. Then tape or stick the label in place where it's clearly visible. Do not cover the bar codes of the label with tape. If the company you are using requires a special label, you may have to fill out shipping documents before the driver can take the package. Generally, the driver brings these when picking up the package.Some companies may require you to be present at package pickup. Others may require you to select a pickup location, like your mailbox, at your front/back door, and so on.

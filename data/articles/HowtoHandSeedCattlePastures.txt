 Grass and legume seeds would be of any species you've chosen to seed your pastures with, depending on your location. Put as much in as you can comfortably carry, depending on how far you have to carry it or how big of an area you want to seed at one time.;
, Move quietly and calmly among them, taking your time to gently scatter the seeds around their feet and over the whole area of the pasture.


The cows will push the seed into the soil with their hooves and naturally fertilize the area with the waste they excrete.



Pay special attention to areas that suffer from high traffic areas, such as near and around watering areas, gates, etc.

Please note that you may find that growing grass in this area will be much more difficult because these areas see a lot of hoof traffic, much more than out in the pasture. This could make it harder for the seeds to grow properly into grass or legume plants.

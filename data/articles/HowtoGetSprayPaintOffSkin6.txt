 An old credit card or the handle of a disposable razorboth work well, for instance.


If using a credit card, make sure that you do not use the portion of the card nearest the magnetic strip, since this magnetic strip could get damaged, thereby rendering the card unusable.
If using a disposable razor, make sure that the handle has a blunt, defined edge.
Do not use anything that could cut your skin, and avoid objects made from glass or metal. Sturdy plastic will work best for this method.
 Hold the skin taut with one hand. Use your other hand to gently scrape the paint off your skin, starting from one end of the paint splotch and working your way to the other end.









Note that this will work best if the spray paint has already dried onto your skin. This method may not prove as useful if working with wet or tacky spray paint.
 Thoroughly rinse off the flakes of paint under running water and wipe your skin with a clean paper towel to dry. If you notice additional paint still stuck on your skin, you can try repeating the process to flake it off, as well.









For paint that has seeped too far down into the skin, however, this may not work. Physical force does not lift paint in deeply stained skin up and only takes care of the paint lying on the surface.

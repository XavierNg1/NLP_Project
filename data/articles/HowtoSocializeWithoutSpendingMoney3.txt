 Oftentimes, you go out without the intention of spending money but end up getting hungry. Social events often revolve around food. You may, for example, go to a free concert thinking you won't spend a time, only to be tantalized by the smell of the hot dog stand. You may go hang out at a friend's place and end up pitching in for pizza even though you planned on not spending money. Eating before a social event can help you resist this temptation.Have a big meal before you go out. Stick to healthy foods that won't leave you hungry later, like whole wheats, fruits and vegetables, and lean proteins.
This can also be helpful if you're trying to lose weight. You will fill up on healthy foods and won't waste calories on junk food.
 If you do end up spending a little money socializing, try not to do so at a bar. Bars are notorious for having high prices. The cost of alcohol at a bar is much greater than it would be simply buying alcohol at a store. If your friends want to get drinks, suggest you have drinks at someone's place rather than out at a bar., Even free events can have unexpected costs, so watch out for these. Try to eliminate hidden costs when you can. You may, for example, have to pay for parking at a free concert. You can eliminate this cost, however, by taking public transportation., It's not easy having to budget while wanting to be social. Your friends may sometimes struggle to understand the issue. Try to encourage them to lighten up and spend.If your friends are trying to pressure you into spending money, say something like, "I know you guys want me to have fun, but I'm really trying to save right now."
It can sometimes help to explain your financial situation. For example, "I'm trying to pay off my credit card right now" or "I really need to save up for that new car."

Take a warm travel cage and put towels on the bottom.
Talk to your pet in soothing voices, and explain what is going on. It may seem silly, but birds are intelligent creatures. Even if your companion doesn't understand what you're saying, it will recognize and find comfort in your voice.
Make sure your bird can see what is going on at all times, so it isn't afraid of predators, and make sure the bird is able to see you at all times. If the bird sees something familiar and comforting (you, for instance), it will be less likely to panic. Stroke your bird often and never leave its side.;
,


This shows the bird that this is a nice person (because you are interacting with him/her), and it helps you gain more information about what is going on. How can you help your pet if you are not informed? Knowledge is key. If you know what is happening, it will put you at ease, and your bird will sense that emotion and be more comfortable, too.
You can even explain to your pet what is happening, if it makes you feel better. Talking about the situation aloud will also help you remember it for future reference.



If the vet has to preform something on your bird that the bird has not been exposed to before, it will most likely panic and thrash, which may alarm you. Stay calm.
Remember that a bird is a prey animal, and its first instinct is to get away from the cause of the panic.
After the procedure is over, ask if you can hold your pet bird. Holding, stroking, and interacting with your pet will put it at ease and tell it that everything is okay now. Speak calmly to your pet in soothing tones, and stroke it in a way that is familiar.

 You can use PayPal to make many online purchases. Linking a debit or credit card to your PayPal account allows you to use your PayPal balance for real life shopping.


For online purchases, PayPal can be used in lieu of a credit card if it's linked to your bank account. This can increase your security, as the seller only receives your PayPal account number and no information from your bank or credit card.
PayPal, depending on your personal use, may freeze your account or limit the amount of money you can withdraw each month. Make sure you're following PayPal policy and upgrade your account to Premium or Business if you have a high number of PayPal transactions.
 To link your card, open your PayPal wallet and click “Link a card.” Enter your credit or debit card information and click “Save.”

, The majority of online transactions go through without incident, however, there is a risk of fraud when buying online and PayPal account hacks can cause serious financial damage.


Look for the seller’s reviews. Most sellers have reviews online. Before making a purchase, try doing a few web searches for the seller’s name plus the word “reviews” or “fraud.”
Don’t respond to unsolicited sellers. This happens often on eBay. If you get a message about an item you’ve never inquired about, don’t respond. Established sellers typically don’t recruit buyers, so these messages could be scams.
If your item has a delivery date more than 20 days after making a purchase this is a sign of potential fraud.

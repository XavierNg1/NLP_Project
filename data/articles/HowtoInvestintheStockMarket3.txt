 Selling stocks as soon as they rise in price is a sure way to move nowhere fast. Practice self control and hold on to solid stocks unless you're desperate to raise cash. Good stocks can result in big payoffs over the long run.


If you buy and sell repeatedly, much of your profit will go to commissions for brokers, and your gains will suffer.
"Day trading" is stacked against newcomers, because they trade against seasoned professionals and computer programs designed to buy and sell at optimum moments.
Instead, hold on to stocks of companies that are solid and growing. If your stocks pay dividends, reinvest them to increase your earning potential.
 Once your portfolio is established, revisit it every so often and make appropriate changes.


Move money out of sectors that aren't performing well and invest more in areas that are seeing greater returns.
Add more investments with additional funds as they become available in order to continue diversifying.
 Ideally, you want to sell a stock when it reaches the value you determined when investigating the company and when the value is not expected to rise much more.


If your stock has not met the target value and doesn't look like it's going to, sell it, especially if the price falls below the moving average. This is typically seen as the "last chance" to get rid of a stock before it dips too low.

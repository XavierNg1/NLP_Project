 The pretzel braid looks elaborate, but the execution is not difficult. The hairstyle is idea for a wedding because it provides a romantic look, but will last throughout your wedding festivities.



Part your hair down the center.






Make 2 pigtails. Secure them with rubber bands along the back of your head, approximately 2 inches (5.1Â cm) above the nape of your neck.






Braid the pigtails using a traditional braiding technique. Separate the hair into 3 sections and weave them together by slipping 1 section between the other 2 sections in a traditional braid pattern.






Secure each end with a rubber band or hair elastic.






Remove the rubber bands from the top of the pigtails.






Cross 1 braid over the other braid along the back of your head.






Create a curved C-shape with the braid that is on top. Pin it into place using bobby pins.






Repeat the curved C-shape with the other braid, curving it up and over the top of the braid you just secured. Pin it into place with bobby pins. The braids should look like a knot or pretzel shape.






Tuck both ends of the braids behind the knot, and secure with bobby pins.

 Having a positive mindset will help you in your change process. Positive thinking leads to a longer life span, reduced rates of depression, better physical health and immune functioning, and better coping in times of stress.To be a more positive thinker, watch your self-talk. Don't say anything to yourself that you would not say to a close friend or loved one.
When you notice yourself being especially self-critical, question the validity of these statements. Are they really true? Where is the evidence? Evaluate your negative self-talk and create positive affirmations to replace them.
 Truly committing to being a better version of yourself means being a lifelong learner. Not only must you constantly assess and reassess yourself, but you must also be willing to consider ideas and opinions different than your own. Use these tips to be a lifelong learner:Read fiction and nonfiction books

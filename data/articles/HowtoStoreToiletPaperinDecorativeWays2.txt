 Purchase fabric to match your bathroom d√©cor (long and wide enough to hold one or even two rolls of toilet paper) and decorative ribbon.


Punch a hole on each end of the fabric and thread the ribbon through the holes.
, You can purchase small shelving at the local hardware store you can make your own using steel brackets and plywood.
 Create a toilet paper dispenser with two hooks that hang off the side of the toilet. Design this storage system similar to the toilet paper hammock, just use hooks instead of ribbon.

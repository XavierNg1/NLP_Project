 If you can't see this option, try Settings then Select Scan Device. The image will appear to the screen.
 For this purpose, press the Create for selection-icon in the toolbar and select an area to be scanned. If you really need only a fraction of the image, then this will speed the scanning. Note that the dimensions of the selection appear in the selection field together with the image size with current DPI selection., Consider your need. A higher DPI means more detail but it will be slower to scan and result in a larger file.,, The program will ask for type of the image for example JPG or BMP, make your choice. It will also ask for the name of the image, default is kscan_nnnn, make your choice. The image will appear in the image list on the left.,,

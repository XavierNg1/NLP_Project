Don't make them too close, or your picture will look crammed.
If you want to have the "infinity" look, put the dots about 0.5 centimeter (0.2Â in) away from each edge of the page.
If you want to see the end in your picture, put each dot on the very edge of the page.
 These will be your guide-lines.
 Make them connect with the dots you drew from the Left side to right, right side to right. Work top to bottom when drawing.

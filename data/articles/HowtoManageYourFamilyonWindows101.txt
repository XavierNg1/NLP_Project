 On your Windows 10 PC, you can easily find the Settings application by searching in the search box at the bottom right of the screen. Accounts is a box with the icon of a person in the first screen of the Settings application. Family & other users is found in the sidebar on the left.;
, A new window should now pop up with two choices, Add a child or Add an adult, and a text box for their email.
 Choose Add a child if the family member is a child and you wish to control their use of the PC; choose Add an adult if the family member is an adult and you wish to give them full rights to the PC. Either way, everyone gets their own sign-in and desktop.
 This will send an email to them and invite them to join your computer through a Microsoft account. If they don't have an email address, click The person I want to invite doesn’t have an email address.
 Once they've accepted your invite, they can now sign in using the same email address the invitation was sent to and set up their account on your computer. Congratulations!

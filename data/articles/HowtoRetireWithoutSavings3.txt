 If you’re nearing retirement, do everything you can to eliminate all debt. Debt is a needless drain on your income as a retiree, and it prevents you from making the savings you need to make.One of the most popular ways to tackle debt is the “snowball method,” paying off the debt with the highest interest rates first.
 Another tactic to reduce expenses in retirement is lowering monthly payments. You can try to negotiate with service providers (like cable companies and phone companies) yourself, or you can outsource it to a third party.For example, a company called Billcutterz will negotiate with all of your service providers to lower your monthly payments. You pay nothing up front; you just agree to let them take half of the savings for the first year.
 One radical way some retirees have cut down on expenses is by selling their home and making an RV their primary residence. The modern generation of RVs are surprisingly spacious and comfortable, making RV living the ideal situation for the traveling retiree.Most retirees who make this choice pay cash for the RV, which drastically reduces monthly expenses with a chunk of cash leftover from the sale of the house.
 More and more retirees are making relocation a part of their retirement strategy. Relocating outside the US can provide the expatriate with a higher standard of living for less money than they could enjoy in the US. With innovations like email, Skype, and social media, staying connected with family member overseas is easier than ever.You’ll want to thoroughly research the legal and financial implications of any retirement destination, but some of the most popular expatriate destinations are Panama, the Dominican Republic, Portugal, and Italy.

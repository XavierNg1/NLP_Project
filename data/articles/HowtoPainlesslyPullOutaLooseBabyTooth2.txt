 The analgesic will take 2–3 minutes to numb the gums. While you wait, reassure your child that the process of removing the loose tooth will be painless.If your child is apprehensive about the pain, you can also give them a child-sized dosage of an over-the-counter painkiller, such as ibuprofen.


You can purchase oral analgesic or ibuprofen at your local drugstore or any pharmacy. Analgesics do not require a prescription.Consult a pediatric dentist before doing this so you can make sure you give the right dosage.
 Rather than yanking on the tooth, lightly wiggle it back and forth, and left and right, if possible, to help loosen more fibers. The tooth should be very loose at this point—if the tooth is still firmly attached to the gum, it is not ready to be pulled yet. Once the tooth has been loosened, you can begin to gently pull it out of your child’s gum.Before putting your hands in your child’s mouth, first put on a pair of latex gloves, or use a clean cotton cloth to touch the tooth.
 A tooth should be very loose before you attempt to pull it.Even so, avoid yanking or tugging on the tooth, as these motions are more likely to cause your child pain and tear their gums. Exert a steady, gentle pressure on the tooth, or even twist it slightly until the last fibers connecting the tooth to the gum snap.


After you remove the tooth, clean it off with a small piece of gauze. You can also press some gauze onto the spot where the tooth was in your child's mouth to stop any bleeding.
Once the tooth is clean, show it to your child. Children are often curious about the teeth that have come out of their mouth. Let them hold the tooth and put it under the pillow for the tooth fairy.

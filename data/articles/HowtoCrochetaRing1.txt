 Attach the yarn to your crochet hook using a slip knot, then work enough chain stitches to create a chain long enough to wrap around your finger.

The exact number of chains will vary depending on your ring size. Start checking the length of the chain against your finger after making 11 or 12 stitches, then continue to adjust the length as needed with additional stitches.;
, Join the last stitch of your chain to the first using a slip stitch.

This step creates the basic ring structure. Since the slip stitch does add some length, it's a good idea to check the size of the ring once again before continuing to the next step.
 Chain one, then work one single crochet into each stitch across the round.

Once you reach the end of the round, join the last stitch to the top of the first stitch using a slip stitch.
Do not turn the work at the end of the round.
 Chain one, then work one single crochet into the back loops only of each stitch across the round.

Join the last and first stitch of the round with a slip stitch.
 Cut the yarn, leaving a 1-inch to 2-inch tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

Use a tapestry needle to weave the ends of the yarn into the stitches.
This step completes the project, and your ring should be ready to wear.

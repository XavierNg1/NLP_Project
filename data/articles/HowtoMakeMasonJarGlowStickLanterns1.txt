 Preferably new jars so that all you will need to do is wipe out the inside and outside with a damp rag. If you are removing food from the jars, rinse well and either put them in the dishwasher or scrub with hot water and soap. Allow jars to dry before beginning your project.









Make sure each jar has a well-fitting lid. You will need to top the jar with the lid and shake to create the illumination. If the lid doesn’t fit properly, the glow stick material could spill.;
, Purchase several glow sticks--approximately one per jar.
 You’ll want to make a clean cut along the top of the glow stick in order to extract the liquid.

 Blocking software, popular for weeding out adware or malware, can supersede your browser's blocking functions. Check if any software you own is keeping you from viewing popups.
 If you're operating Windows, go to Start; Control Panel; Internet Options; Privacy. In the Privacy tab, turn off "Pop-up blocker." In "Settings," set the Filter level back to medium (default).
 Extensions are add-ons that add functionality to your browser. Certain add-ons are used to control popups, and yours may be overzealous. Go to your browser's settings and manage extensions, double-checking that your extensions are no longer blocking popups.

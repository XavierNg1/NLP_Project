 Through this website, you can search for and access federal court records 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Fill out the online registration form. Information with a red asterisk next to it is mandatory, but everything else is optional. You will need to provide the following information:


Your first and last names
Date of birth
Home address, email address, and phone number
Your “user type.” If you are directly involved in a case, mark “Plaintiff, Defendant or Debtor in a Case.” If you are a journalist, mark “Media,” and so on.
 If you know where the case you're looking for was tried, look for the specific court that houses the record. Limiting your search to a single court will make it much easier to find the record you're looking for.


For example, you might search the records for the Middle District of Georgia or the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.
 If you don't know the specific court that houses the record, you have to search the entire database of federal courts. This database holds an enormous amount of records, so provide as much information as possible. If the person you're researching has a common name (Jane Smith), searching by case number might be easier and faster.
 Though creating a PACER account is free, you do have to pay a small fee to view individual records. The fee is 10 cents per page of a document, up to $3.00.


Even if the document is a thousand pages long, you won't have to pay more than the $3.00 max.

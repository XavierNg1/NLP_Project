 A fake smile is rarely convincing. Understand that a natural smile requires your entire face. Smile comfortably and frequently, but not constantly., Your facial expressions will communicate your interests and attentiveness to the other person. Make sure that you are looking at the person with whom you are engaging and not browsing the room. Avoid yawning or rolling your eyes. Lifting your eyebrows or tilting your head slightly will also show the other person that you are interested and paying attention to them.When it is your turn to speak, stay on topic and respond to what the other person was saying. This will show them that you were listening.
 Breathe at the same pace as the other person. This may help others feel comfortable and relaxed around you. If the other person appears anxious with a faster breathing pace, become aware of your own breath. Give it a slightly slower and more consistent pace. After some time, you may notice that the other personâ€™s breathing rate is slowing down as they become more comfortable with you., How you hold your body says a lot about your personality. Mostly, it conveys to the other person how comfortable and confident you are in the situation. By sitting (or standing) up straight you will show that you are confident. Keeping your arms uncrossed when you are standing and legs uncrossed when you are sitting is best practice. It is a sign of openness and will help to make you more approachable.

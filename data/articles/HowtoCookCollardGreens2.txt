 Use medium-high heat, and continue heating 1 tbsp. of olive oil until the oil easily glides over the entire bottom of the pan., Add 2 tbsp. of minced garlic to the hot oil and move it around with a spatula, keeping it moving to prevent it from burning. Continue cooking for about 20 seconds, until the garlic begins to change in color to a deeper yellow or light tan.
 It is better to add all the greens at once than to do so in batches to ensure that all the greens get the same amount of heat, oil, and garlic. Add the strips and stir with your spatula, making sure that all the greens are coated in oil.
 Add 1/2 tsp. of crushed red pepper or jalape√±os and 1/4 tsp. of salt to the collard greens. Wait approximately 30 seconds and toss the greens again with your spatula to mix the seasonings into the rest of the greens. Mix thoroughly, moving the top to the bottom and the greens on the bottom to the top, several times, to ensure the greens are evenly mixed.
 Use your spatula and continue tossing the shreds of collard greens. Do not let it sit for long without movement. Moving the greens around is the only way to ensure the greens are evenly heated and evenly cooked.
 The greens should still be bright green, however. Turn off the stove and remove the pan from the heating element.
 Red wine vinegar or cider vinegar would also work if you do not have balsamic vinegar available. Drizzle the vinegar over the greens and toss again to coat.
 The greens can also be enjoyed at room temperature.

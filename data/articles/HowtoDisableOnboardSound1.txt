 Depending on what system you are running and which BIOS version you have, there will be variations in how to access and make changes to your system's BIOS. All BIOS versions will have a key assigned that must be pressed immediately after the power is turned on.


Identify the assigned key for accessing the system BIOS. The most common keyboard keys assigned for opening the system's BIOS are the delete key, F1, F2, F11 and the escape key. There is usually a prompt at the bottom of the screen just after the system is powered up that tells the user which key has been assigned for opening the system BIOS.
Use the assigned key to access the BIOS screen. Once you have identified the key, restart your computer and tap the key several times when the system powers up. The BIOS screen will open.;
, The disable on-board audio option is typically located on the Integrated Peripherals section of the BIOS menu. Scroll to the right using the directional arrows on your keyboard to locate the Integrated Peripherals section.


Locate the primary audio device in the Integrated Peripherals menu. The name of the audio device in the list of peripherals will vary, but will typically include the word "audio" or "AC97."
Disable the audio device by using the directional arrows to navigate to the category options. Selecting "disable" and press the enter key on your keyboard.
 You automatically will be taken back to the Standard Settings menu. Use the directional arrows to navigate to the "Save Settings and Exit" option and press enter. The on-board audio is disabled and your system will boot-up automatically.

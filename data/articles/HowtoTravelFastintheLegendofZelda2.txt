 Since Epona is not available on all versions of Legend of Zelda, you’ll have to travel fast using other means. For games without Epona, you can still travel fast by running using the Pegasus Boots. It allows Link to dash at an incredible speed, bashing through weak enemies with ease. Unlike Epona, Pegasus Boots are quest items that can only be acquired by finishing certain missions and can only be found on the following missions of specific game versions:



The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap – Pegasus Boots can be obtained after waking the sleepy shoemaker in Hyrule.

The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords/ Four Swords Adventures – Pegasus Boots can be obtained randomly on Item Podiums scattered throughout the game.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link between Worlds – A character named “Shady Guy” will give Link the boots once the hero catches him in Kakariko Village.

The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening – The boots can be found inside the third dungeon of the Koholint island named “Key Cavern.”

The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past – The boots can be obtained from a character named Sahasrahla after getting the “Pendant of Courage” from the Eastern Palace.
 Press the “Start” button on the controller of whatever Nintendo console you’re using to open its menu. Using the Arrow keys, select the Pegasus Boots from the list of items you have and press the Action button you want to assign it to, like the X or Y (Wii), or A or B (Game Boy).


Press the Start button again to go back to the gameplay.
 Press the Action button you assigned the Pegasus Boots to, and Link will start “jogging” in place. Press the directional arrows keys, while holding the Action button, towards the direction you want to go, and Link will start dashing.
 While dashing, Link can only do a 90-degrees turn by pressing the directional arrow keys. To stop dashing, lift your fingers from the Action and directional arrow buttons, and Link will stop from running.

 THE most important thing you need to know: what kind of tone are you looking for, or what are you lacking in your current setup? Make sure it's not the amp, or anything else that you're not liking. If you have cheap ceramic pickups, chances are you need to replace them if you want a better sound.


What kind of tone are you after? If you want a single coil with more punch to drive your amp harder (if it is a tube amp), you can try single-coil sized humbuckers, made by big companies such as DiMarzio or Seymour Duncan, among others. Or maybe you'd like a cleaner-sounding pickup, that has a vintage output? Many companies offer various styles; some well known ones are Fender Custom Shop '69s, '54s, and so on. Check many manufacturers.
AlNiCo pickups have a balanced, and bright sound, with emphasis on highs and not so much mids. Ceramic pickups are usually hotter and have more mid-range.;
, More turns means that the magnetic field is enhanced, and will produce more mid-range. An example is the Fender Texas Special. Fewer turns means the sound will be brighter and cleaner.


You may find something like D.C. resistance, which is a general way of getting where you want to be. More turns of wire=higher D.C. resistance=less treble. If you want vintage-sounding, 5 K-ohms through 7 K-ohms is where you'd like to be. For fatter and stronger sounds, anything higher will do.
 Be prepared to spend close to $200 for a set, maybe more, if you want Fralins or Duncans. However, some small companies can do it for a lot less. Try to play guitars with your desired style of pickup, and try to approximate your set-up as well.

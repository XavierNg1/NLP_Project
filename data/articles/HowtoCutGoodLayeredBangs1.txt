 Place your index finger on your part, with your second knuckle on your hairline. The tip of your index finger will be where you begin combing your bangs.









Make sure that your hair is dry. Wet hair can stretch by up to 45%, so it’s much longer when it’s wet. If you cut it while it’s wet, you might cut more than you intend.;
, Make a diagonal line away from your part down to your hairline. Keep this line straight., You can also clip it back from your face, if your hair is shorter. Make sure that the only hair you’re cutting is the hair in the part you’ve sectioned off to be bangs.
 Use your nondominant hand. Make sure that the hair is even and pulled taut.
 Though you could pick any angle you’d like, a recommended angle is to cut them on a parallel line to the one that you’ve created when you sectioned off your bangs. Cut them somewhere between the top of your lip (for a longer bang) and the tip of your nose (for a shorter bang). Try to cut them in one or two even snips.
 Be conservative when cutting them. Try them just a little bit shorter at first, and then gradually work up to the length and angle you want as you keep cutting.
 Keep the scissors open while you’re cutting. Move horizontally across your bangs, but cut vertically.

 Combine ¾ cup (180 mL) raspberries or strawberries, 1 cup (240 mL) water, and 1 cup (240 mL) white sugar in a medium saucepan.


If using frozen fruit, let them thaw for ten minutes before you begin.
 Place the saucepan over medium-high heat on the stovetop and bring to a boil. Once the mixture is steaming or gently boiling, stir it until the sugar is completely dissolved. This simple syrup should keep the sugar completely dissolved, so there's no risk of ending up with a pile of sugar in your lemonade glass.
 Reduce the heat to low and simmer the mixture until the fruit starts to fall apart. This usually takes 10 to 12 minutes for raspberries and about 20 minutes for strawberries. If the syrup isn't pink yet, stir the fruit and press it against the sides.
 Pour the syrup mixture through a mesh strainer into a large pitcher. Press the fruit against the mesh with the back of the spoon to release more juice and color.
 Let the syrup cool for about 15 minutes. Place it uncovered in the refrigerator for another 30 minutes after that.


Squeeze the lemons while you wait, if you're squeezing the lemon juice yourself.
 Add 1½ cups (355 mL) lemon juice and 3½ cups (830 mL) water to the pitcher containing the syrup and stir thoroughly.


You may want to add the water and lemon juice ½ cup (120 mL) at a time, tasting in between to see whether you want more lemon juice or more water.
 If you're not planning to drink the lemonade for a few hours, leave a fresh-picked basil leaf or two to soak and add more flavor to the pink lemonade. Remove the soggy leaf and replace it with a fresh garnish before serving.

 Before you change your cat’s diet, you should talk to your vet. Your vet can help determine if your cat has an intolerance or allergy to gluten.

Your vet may also perform saliva or blood tests., Gluten is commonly found in cat food. Choose a cat food that is free from gluten-containing ingredients like wheat, barley, and rye. You should also be on the lookout for ingredients that could be contaminated with gluten, like oats, buckwheat, rice, or quinoa. Whenever possible, select a food labeled gluten-free.You can choose a wet or dry food, as long as it is free from gluten-containing ingredients.
 Place your cat on a gluten free cat food for at least thirty days. During this period, closely monitor your cat’s symptoms and note if they improve or disappear. At the end of the thirty days, give your cat a food that contains gluten for one week. If your cat’s symptoms reappear, your cat might benefit from a gluten free food., If you decide to change your cat's diet, you should make an appointment with your vet to discuss your cat's progress. This will allow you to communicate changes in your cat's health to your vet and troubleshoot any unresolved issues.

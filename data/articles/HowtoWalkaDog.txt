 There will come a time when your four-legged friend will recognize it is time to go for a walk by you simply reaching for the leash. Introduce this in your dog’s mind early on by using a collar at a young age. Place the collar around the dog’s neck and say “let’s walk” with the leash in full view.;
, You want to make sure the collar isn’t too tight around your dog’s neck. A good rule of thumb is to ensure you can place one to two fingers between the collar and your dog’s neck. You also don’t want the collar to be loose enough to slip over your dog’s ears if it tries to back out of it.
 Consistency is important when training your dog to walk. Choosing a side for the dog to walk establishes its spot in the activity. The puppy will become accustomed to walking with you by knowing what to expect.

 The most important aspect of learning how to walk your dog is maintaining control so that your pet doesn’t dictate the walk. You are the boss and this should be reflected in your walking relationship as well.Wrap your traditional leash around your hand until there is very little give between you and your pet.
Pull the leash close to your body but allow enough give to allow your dog to walk naturally.
Your dog will feel the resistance of the leash and realize that getting ahead of you is unacceptable.
 Your dog understands the tone in your voice. Don’t get frustrated. Encourage your dog with a “good job” or “way to go” when it does something right. Use a stern voice when instructing it not to do the wrong things, like bark at people passing by or growling at other dogs.
 Use treats when teaching your dog to walk but especially when you want to teach your pet to not pull on the leash. Reward often and consistently. Reserve a treat that your dog especially likes for training purposes. Many dogs are quite enthusiastic about pieces of hot dog, cheese, or jerky.

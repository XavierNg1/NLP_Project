 Choose an area of water that you trust and know to be safe.


A shallow lake or lake area is ideal. Or, a pond.
Avoid using a river unless you know the spot really well and it is neither fast flowing nor deep.
Avoid any water that is murky, contains a lot of plants that could catch your dog's paws or that leads to fast-flowing areas, rips or sudden drops (such as waterfalls).
A place that has other people around can be ideal if your dog loves company.
Choose a place that allows you to take a dog. Any anxiety on your behalf of not being where you're allowed to be will transfer to the dog.;
, Bring along some familiar gear, such as a ball and some doggie treats to soothe your training dog. Also bring your own swimming gear, as you need to get into the water with your dog to begin with.
 Some breeds do not like to be in water and some do not know how to swim. Be aware of your dog's breed limitations.
 Begin by tossing a ball into the shallows of the water. Let your dog run in to fetch it, still able to stand.


If your dog goes in the water to get the ball, reward her with a dog treat.
Keep repeating the exercise, until you see that your dog is happily familiar with the water.
 Wade out to waist deep water.
 Place her in the water.
 However, keep holding her until she develops a good form and seems steady and sure of her strokes.
 Start walking to the shore yourself and it's likely she'll follow you. Keep a close eye on her though.
 The dog's form will continue to improve and in no time, she'll be a swimming machine without a second thought to what she's doing.

 This will tell you if there are any special instructions you should follow regarding the care of your jacket, including washing instructions.The care label could tell you to hand-wash the jacket, to machine wash it on a special cycle, or to take the jacket to a professional down cleaner.
If your jacket only needs a minor cleaning, the pre-cleaning alone might be sufficient, and you might not need to fully wash or hand wash.;
, Down-filled materials can rip easily when wet,so it’s important to take care of anything that could catch or pull during the washing process.


Do up zippers
Button buttons
Close hook and loop fasteners
Secure flaps
Remove items from the pockets and secure the pockets

, With a clean, dry cloth, wipe away any dirt, debris or loose mud from the jacket. This will make the cleaning process a little easier, because you won’t be dealing with large clumps of mud or dust., To clean and spot clean a down jacket, use a pure soap or a special down soap that won’t strip the feathers of oil and make them brittle.Pour a small amount of soap on affected areas, such as stains, tough-to-clean grime, and patches of oil or sweat. Let it soak for about 15 minutes.Good soaps to use include:


Nikwax Down Wash
Granger’s Down Wash
ReviveX Down Cleaner

, Fill a bath tub, wash basin, or sink with warm water. Place the jacket into the water and gently agitate it with your hands. Let the jacket soak for 10 to 15 minutes.Soaking the jacket before washing helps to remove excess dirt, debris, and soap from the spot cleaning.
After soaking, move the jacket away from the drain and empty the tub. Gently squeeze the excess water from the jacket.

 A data commentary is similar to other types of commentaries in that it requires you to analyze an existing set of information. But instead of commenting on a book or film, you are writing about a set of data. A data commentary may occasionally be a stand-alone piece of writing, but it is typically found in the end of a report, generally called the Results or Discussion.You might also be asked by your boss or teacher to write a data commentary. Make sure to ask about their expectations, such as length.
 One of the key components of a data commentary is synopsis of the research. You need to concisely write about the results of the study and why it is important. Make sure to analyze and summarize the data.For example, if the research is about the graduation rate in the Chicago Public Schools, you need to explain the numbers and illustrate why the results are important.
 In a data commentary, you will likely want to use charts or graphs to help illustrate the results. You might include a table that shows how much American households pay for insurance. You will then want to comment on and analyze those visuals.You might say something like, “As shown in Figure 1.2, the costs of healthcare of risen at a steady rate since 2000.”

, In your conclusion, make sure to do more than just repeat what you’ve already said. Using different wording, you can reemphasize the significance of the results. You can also recommend further avenues for research.As in the rest of your data commentary, your conclusion should refer to specific pieces of data.
 A data commentary requires you to include not only facts and figures, but also where you found this information. You need to cite your resources according to accepted citation formats.You should include a specific section for resources at the end of your data commentary.
Any time you cite numbers or a quote, make sure to provide a reference.

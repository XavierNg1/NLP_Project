 For some people, dog proofing your office means keeping your pooch completely out of the office. If you’re not thrilled about having a canine co-worker, keeping the door to your office closed tight will ensure you can work without Fido at your feet.
 A great way to keep your pet out of the office is to place a gate in the doorway. You can buy a dog-specific gate for your office. If you don’t want to invest in a new gate, you can always use a baby gate that you already have. Keep the gate positioned in the doorway at all times to ensure the dog does not enter your office.
 If you don’t want to close the door or put up a gate to prevent the dog from entering your office, you can always train your pet to stay away from the office space. Try telling your pet to “halt” when he gets near the office door. Then ask him to “sit” and “stay.” If your dog abides by these commands, give him a treat for his good behavior.

 When writing a manuscript in ASA format, it’s very important that you remain objective and professional while writing the paper. Specifically, pay attention to the following:


Use third person. In other words, don’t use “I,” “we,” or “you” unless allowed by your professor.
Try to keep the language as simple as possible. Don’t use unnecessary jargon or vocabulary.
Avoid using gendered words. For instance, use “humankind” instead of “mankind.” Similarly, avoid any racist language.
Use original thought. Don’t steal other people’s ideas without crediting them.
 Generally, when writing a scientific paper, you give a literature review. All that means is that you provide a summary of research that has been done on similar topics to your own. Since that research was done in the past, use past tense verb tense to write about it.


For instance, you would say that “Roberts researched rats,” (past tense) rather than “Roberts researches rats” (present tense). Also, use past tense when describing your own methodology.
However, you are free to choose past or present tense for your results section. Just be sure to stick with what you choose throughout the section.
 For instance, this article uses the acronym “ASA” to stand for “American Sociological Association,” but it was spelled out above before the acronym was used. Normally, you would even spell it out in a title if it hasn’t been used in the text.


However, you should always spell out names of states, countries, provinces, and so on, instead of using abbreviations.
 As with most style guidelines, write out numbers one through nine and numbers at the beginning of a sentence, but use numbers for 10 and above.


Also, use numbers for decimals (9.82) and other measurements but not for fractions (two-fifths).
For very large numbers, use “million” or “billion” instead of using numbers for all of it (5.3 million).

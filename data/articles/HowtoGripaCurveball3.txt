 For this pitch, you will grip the ball with your thumb, middle finger, and knuckle of your index finger. Holding it this way allows the ball to break sharper and later (closer to the batter).While more difficult to grip (and throw), knuckle curves increase speed without sacrificing spin.


A knucklecurve grip is on average 2.5 mph (4 km/h) faster than a standard curveball.
Over a quarter of curveballs thrown by major league pitchers in 2013 were classified as knucklecurves., Place the ball in the palm of your hand so the seams curve to the side of the ball. Bend your middle finger over the top of the ball so it rests along the seam. Next, take the index finger and bend it so the knuckle rests on top of the ball next to your middle finger.Think of the knuckle of your middle finger "digging" into the top of the ball., The placement of the thumb and middle finger are identical to other types of curveballs. The thumb should be placed on or along the seam on the bottom of the ball so it forms a "C" with the middle finger. Stabilize the bottom of the ball by curving your ring finger in and resting the ball against the first and second joint., Throw as you would for a regular curveball. As you release the ball, snap your middle finger and thumb together so it pivots against the knuckle of your index finger.This will help generate the speed and spin required for the ball to reach its target and break or curve downwards.

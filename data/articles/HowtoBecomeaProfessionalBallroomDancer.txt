 You can't just wake up one day and decide "Hey, I think I'll take up Ballroom dancing". It is much too expensive to just whim on. Actually have the passion to ballroom dance, and go from there.;
, Of course, you are not obligated to keep this partner all throughout your career, but it would be a smart choice to pick one that you can get along with. You will be practicing hours upon hours upon hours together and you will be travel buddies as you travel around to compete in competitions, and that could be anywhere, so be prepared.
 Training 4 hours or more will be the norm, and will need to be willing to travel the world going to competition. Warning, you need years and years of lessons to become the professional dancer that all ballroom dancers tend to enjoy.
 Get some ballet training, as this will help you tremendously in your ballroom. Learning different dancing will help you see what looks really good on the dance floor. Also, try working with multiple different coaches because your coach can act as a judge and help you to critique your dance moves.
 Ballroom is perhaps the most expensive sport in the world. A half hour lesson can cost anywhere between 80$-300$. Not to mention the costumes are dramatically expensive. Also, you will be paying for lodging and traveling expenses to be on the lookout for that as well.
 Build your endurance, which will help with your dancing.
 Female ballroom dancers are required to have a tan,perfectly manicured nails, and a made-up face while dancing. Men have it a bit easier, but still have to be tan and have to wear tight pants.

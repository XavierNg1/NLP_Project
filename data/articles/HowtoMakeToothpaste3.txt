 For this powder, you will only need three parts baking soda, one part salt, and a few drops of essential oil (optional).Be aware that this is a powder, not a paste. If you prefer a paste, choose one of the other recipes, or add a bit of filtered water to the powder. However, also understand that in terms of effectiveness, there is no difference between them.
A part can mean whatever amount you want it to mean, what is important is the ratio. For example, if you use 3 tablespoons of baking soda, you will then use 1 tablespoon of salt. If you use 6 tablespoons of baking soda, you will use 2 tablespoons of salt for an increased whitening effect. For a better taste, you can also add a few drops of lemon juice.



The shaking method may be better for making sure the two ingredients are well mixed.
 Add a few drops of your favorite to the powder and stir or shake thoroughly.
 If you added essential oil, you should store the powder in a glass jar.If you didnâ€™t, you can store it in a plastic bag or a plastic or glass container. Either way, make sure you store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
 You can wet your brush in the sink and then dip it into the powder until you have a generous layer on your brush, or you can do it without water. If you wish to do this, simply put some of the powder on the brush (without wetting it first) or in your mouth and brush normally for two minutes.


Experiment with and without water to see which method you prefer.

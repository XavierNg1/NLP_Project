 Packing peanuts, bubble wrap, and even boxes can be quite expensive. To save money on these expenses, you can use or reuse items around your house to safely pack your parcel. For example, you might:


Use crumpled newspaper, old blankets, clean rags, or fabric stuffing to keep your packaged items from getting damaged en route.
Salvage boxes from your place of employment, from local businesses (like grocery stores and big box stores), and so on. Black out previous addresses on these with a permanent marker.
 Your home country's national postal service is most likely the least expensive option. However, for regular shipping or high volume shipping, you can often negotiate a better rate than the ones offered by competitors.


If one company has given you a better quote for the cost, mention this to competitors. They might offer to beat that cost.
 Private shipping companies might have special rates for those who are shipping from home for the first time. There might also be special rates offered during the slow season to encourage more shipping. When shopping around, be sure to ask something like:


"I'm planning on shipping a medium sized, 20 pound (9 kg) package from my home. Are there any special rates being offered right now for that kind of shipping?"

, Media mail is a more affordable way of shipping packages under 70 lbs (32 kg). The downside to media mail is that it usually takes much longer than regular shipping, so it isn't preferred for time sensitive packages. Items that qualify for media mail include:Print material at least 8 pages in length (including sheet music, play scripts, manuscripts, guides, periodicals, and so on).
Sound and video recordings (like CDs and DVDs).
Computer material that is readable.
Film (16 mm or narrower)
Educational materials (like test materials and accessories, reference charts, etc.)

 If you have a day at the beginning of the week free, you can make all of the meals for that week in advance. With a little bit more time and planning, you may even be able to cook an entire month worth of meals in one day. All you will need to do is heat the food. This is a great if you have a busy work schedule or not much time to cook. Some healthy meals to make in advance include:


Chicken Noodle Soup
Baked Ziti
Turkey Chili
Indian Curry

, You can put ingredients in a slow cooker in the morning and come home to a fully cooked hot meal. Slow cookers are also great for making meals in large batches. Some wholesome things you can cook in a slow cooker include:


Chuck Roast
Beef Stew
Shredded Chicken
Turkey Breast
Soup

, If you make large batches of food, you can save them by freezing. This will reduce waste and save time. Stick the extra servings in a plastic container or freezer bags. If you need a quick meal sometime later in the month, you can thaw it out and cook it. You should let foods cool completely before placing them in the freezer. You can hurry this process up by letting them cool in the refrigerator.
If using freezer bags, make the bags as flat as possible. This will help them thaw more quickly.
Label the food with both the date you cooked it and the meal name before placing it in the freezer., Some foods are fast but still healthy. Try to pick healthy foods that are easy and quick to make. This is especially helpful with side dishes, such as vegetables or starches.Frozen vegetables are just as healthy as fresh vegetables. They usually only take a few minutes in the microwave to cook.
You may be able to find pre-chopped vegetables at your grocery. You can usually find chopped onions, garlic, sweet potatoes, butternut squash, or carrots.
If you want warm rolls at dinner, you can buy premade frozen dinner rolls that will heat up in the oven. You can also buy premade dough, and bake it yourself.

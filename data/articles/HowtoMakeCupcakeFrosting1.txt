 Place them in a medium bowl and use a mixer to cream the butter and sugar until the mixture becomes light and fluffy, about two minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl every once in a while to make sure all the butter and sugar get mixed in.


If you want to make chocolate buttercream, add the cocoa powder to the bowl and cream it with the butter and sugar. Make sure the cocoa gets completely mixed in, and beat until the mixture is light brown and fluffy.;
, Add the vanilla and cream to the bowl and mix them in thoroughly with your electric mixer.
 This will help you achieve the right light, fluffy, spreadable texture you want for your cupcake frosting. Keep beating until the frosting is slightly stiff.


Add the food coloring if you're making colored frosting.
If the frosting seems too thick, add another tablespoon of cream and keep beating.If it seems too runny, add another 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and keep beating.
 Buttercream frosting pairs wonderfully with any type of cake flavor. You can spread it on with a knife or pipe it on in swirls, and it will hold its shape until you're ready to eat the cupcakes.


Make sure you wait until the cupcakes are completely cool before you frost them; otherwise, the frosting will melt and slide off.
Store extra frosting in the refrigerator for up to three days.

 If you have a volt/amp gauge, it will read the alternator output for you. Run engine at 2,000 rpms for tests and turn on the blower fan for the AC or Heater, the headlamps, and any other accessories that put a strain on the alternator, and watch the gauge to see if it decreases voltage or amperage. As a rule, if the voltmeter is higher when the engine is running than when the engine is not, you can confidently assume that the alternator is charging.
 If there is a problem with the bearings you may hear a squealing sound coming from the front of the car, which becomes louder with more electrical accessories using power at the same time.
 Tune your radio to a low number on the AM band with no music. If the radio whines or goes fuzzy whenever you hit the gas, the alternator is quite likely the culprit.
 Since every store would love for you to buy your new alternator from them, many will try to get the edge-up on their competitors by offering free testing. Dismount your alternator and bring it in to be sure.

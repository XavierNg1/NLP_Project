 Does it line up with neighboring doors? Is it too high or too low? Does it close all the way? Does it leave a gap or overlap too much?
,, You may need to do this for all the hinges on a door at once. Loosen the top and bottom screws, push the door up or down as necessary, and firmly tighten the screws again.

Support the door as you loosen these screws, or it could drop completely out of its initial position.
 Loosen this screw and push the door further in or push it further out.

Try adjusting the hinges in this direction one at a time. It will help to prevent the weight of the door from pulling itself very far out of adjustment. Support the door, especially if you loosen all the in-out adjustment screws at once.
 Tighten this screw (turn clockwise) to move this corner of the door further toward the frame (to the right on this side); loosen it (turn counterclockwise/anticlockwise) to move the door away from the frame (to the left on this side).

This adjustment can also be used to correct a door that is not hanging straight. If the top is further to the left or right than the bottom, adjust the top and bottom hinges separately to correct the tilt.
 Make gradual corrections., One holding the door, and moving; the other one screwing and unscrewing.

 You want new material available regularly, so that the training materials don't become stale. Also, look for a site that has graduated exercises so that you don't become bored once a level becomes too easy for you. Yes, as hard as it might seem at first, it's a skill that you can learn! There are many just a Google search away.;
, There are number of books specifically designed to teach sight reading, and take you through practice exercises methodicallyâ€”each exercise building on the previous exercise, and adding a little something new each time. Here are couple highly-recommended titles:



Improve your Sight-Reading! Piano, Level 1 from Alfred Music Publishing. There are a total of eight volumes, which take you from beginner to advanced.

Primer Level Sightreading Book from Hal Leonard Publishing. For more advanced readers, there are two additional volumes.
 The biggest key to successful sight reading is that you only read and play the music once. You can buy a number of music books, borrow them from the library, or print out piano music from a website. Those will all work, but may result in a haphazard learning process.


Think of it like this: when you learned to read, you started with "See Spot run. Run, Spot, run!" You didn't immediately jump to "O joy, O new vertigo of difference, O my platonic reader-writer racked by a most platonic insomnia..."For the best results, focus on music within your skill range.

 Large potatoes serve one person each, but you'll need 3 or 4 smaller potatoes per person.
 If the potatoes are already small, you can skip this step.
 Cover the potatoes with water. Place a lid on the pot and set it on the stove. Turn the heat to medium-high and allow the potatoes to boil.
 Take off the lid and poke a fork into them to test for doneness.


If the potatoes are fork tender, they are ready for the next step.






If the potatoes are still firm, allow them to cook until they are tender.
 Pour them into a colander, then place them back in the empty pot.
 Use a potato masher to mash the mixture together until it is smooth.


If you have an electric mixer, this can be used in place of the potato masher.






Spice up your mashed potatoes by adding additional seasonings, sour cream, cheese, chives, or green onions.
 Serve alongside a main course of fish or meat.

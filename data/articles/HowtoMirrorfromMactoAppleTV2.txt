 The HDMI port is a six sided port labeled HDMI.


If your Mac does not have an HDMI port you will need a Mini-DisplayPort to HDMI adapter. The adapter will plug into the Mini-DisplayPort on the Mac and then you can plug the HDMI cable into that.
If your TV does not have and HDMI port but has a DVI connection you can use a DVI to HDMI adapter to make the connection.



If using an adapter also check to make sure the HDMI cable is connected to the adapter.
 Note the display name for the port, it should be located adjacent to the port.


If using an adapter also check to make sure the HDMI cable is connected to the adapter.
The name of the port if you're connect with an HDMI cable should be similar to HDMI 1, HDMI 2, etc.
, Do this using your TV remote's "Input" button. Select the input source that corresponds to the port that you plugged the HDMI cable or adapter into. Your TV should now be mirroring your Mac.

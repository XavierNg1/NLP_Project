 Just go with the flow and be yourself. There is no such thing as normal; normal in this context (wikiHow) means to fit in well with society.;
, You don't have to look like that model in "Seventeen." Develop your own style as you go along. If you wear unusual clothing with confidence, you can still be "normal."

, It is important to respect that others might find vulgar language distasteful, including many adults. (Some teens choose to abstain completely from swearing, and that's fine, too!)

, Yes, you're going to meet people who do mean things. But you don't have to be one of those people. You can be whatever and hang with whoever. If your friends don't treat you the way you deserve, or if they pressure you to do things you're not comfortable with, you can choose new friends!

, Don't just lay around the house. Get out and go to the pool with your friends, go talk to boys, play a sport, do whatever you find fun.
 Lots of girls these days have Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Pinterest, etc. You do not have to have these to have a social life. Socialize face-to-face with people.
, You can be cool and normal no matter what your family's economic status.
 Take a shower every day and use antiperspirant. Brush your hair and teeth, floss, use mouthwash, daily stuff.
 Try your best in school. Getting straight A's is excellent; it's not nerdy at all. Make high goals for your academic life, and try your best to achieve them.
 "Normal" girls have best friends and hang out with guys. They occasionally get into trouble with things such as ding-dong-ditch, but nothing too illegal.
 Be yourself; no one likes a poser.
 Don't bottle everything up!

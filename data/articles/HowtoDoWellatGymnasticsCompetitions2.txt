 Not Dunkin-donuts, or McDonalds. Eggs and bacon are good, with toast.
 It may seem strange to target something so obvious, but it has happened that a gymnast "blanked" on even the balance beam mount.
 Continuing on the first step, go over your routine. Even if you went over it the night before, you can never go over your routine to many times. Use the tips in the previous section.
 It is dangerous to do gymnastics without warming up (as in any other sport), as you can pull a muscle. Run around and warm up, then stretch.
 There are many (good) ways to do hair for gymnastics, but some good styles are:


French Braids
Spider Webs
Cornrows
Buns
Pony tail

, Make sure you present before and after every routine on every event as you can lose 0.1 every time you forget.
 That sounds hard, but it's possible. Nerves are notorious for making even the best, most prepared gymnasts mess up. Be confident, especially on beam. Projecting confidence and showing attitude, especially on beam and floor, can give you a higher score even if you mess up.

 Coat a large pot with olive oil and place over high heat. Add the short ribs and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the meat is browned.
 Place the vegetables and garlic in a food processor and puree until the mixture forms a thick paste.
 Drain the fat from the pan, and then coat the bottom of the pan with fresh oil. Add in the pureed vegetables, and cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until browned.


Scrape the bottom of the pan with a spatula occasionally while vegetables cook.
 Pour in the wine, scrape the bottom of the pan, and lower the heat. Cook under low heat until the liquid reduces by half.
 The water should almost completely cover the meat. Add the thyme and bay leaves, cover the pan, and cook in the preheated oven for 3 hours.


Check on the meat periodically, adding more water if necessary. Turn the ribs over halfway through.
 This will allow the meat to brown and the sauce to reduce.
 Pour the braising liquid over the meat for added flavor and moisture. Garnish with parsley if desired, and pair with a glass of rich red wine if you are old enough.

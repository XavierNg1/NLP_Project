 One of the safest and easiest ways to immobilize a cat is by wrapping its body in a towel. Place your cat on top of a towel lying on a flat surface, several inches from the edge of the towel. Cover the cat’s body with the short side of the towel, leaving its head out. Grab the other end of the towel and pull it over the cat’s body.Make sure you do not restrict the cat’s airway.;
, Muzzles can be challenging to put on a cat, due to the shape of most cats’ faces and their propensity to use their teeth as a defense. You can purchase muzzles made specifically for cats, or you can loop a pair of pantyhose around a cat’s mouth to prevent it from biting., If you are unsuccessful immobilizing the cat with a towel or muzzle, you can try placing the cat in a box or pet carrier. If necessary, you can immobilize the cat inside the box by gently tying the cat down with straps or rope., If your cat is hesitant to enter a box or pet carrier, try using food to lure them inside. For example, you can leave a trail of cat treats starting near the opening of the carrier or box. You could also try placing a can of tuna in the box.

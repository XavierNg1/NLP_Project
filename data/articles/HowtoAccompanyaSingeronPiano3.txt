 sounded together. If you speak of only two notes that are to be sounded then that is known as an interval (like a distance).
The C chord made of the notes "C-E-G" some indicated sharps and flats -- which would make whole different chords. Double click the photo to see it larger.

"C" chord:






"F" chord:






"G" chord: The simpler three note chords shown above are major chords in order "C, F, and G" that are made up of only white keys spaces exactly the same way.






Notice that C chord is exactly the same shape (same fingering) as F and G chords in the photos using sticky notes on a keyboard above... but C shown as three notes on lines of sheet music also shows that concept
These three note chords are called triads or triadic formed by a "formula" like a pattern. Chords may have more than three notes (not needed for this basic accompaniment work): for example, a chord of 4, 5 or 6 notes are called tetrads, pentads and hexads (also called tetrachords, pentachords and hexachords).

Also, some chords may be complicated by spaced out combinations of notes that are called "perfect," "augmented," or "diminished", etc. for more complex chords.

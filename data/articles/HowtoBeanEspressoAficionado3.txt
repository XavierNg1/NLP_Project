 Drinking an espresso is an experience in and of itself. And to help you make the most of this pleasure, here are a few tips:


Look at the espresso. Ideally, a shot will be rich brown in color with some speckling or flecking of copper or dark gold. The top layer is called crema, a rapidly-evaporating compound of coffee oils and solids. The thicker and richer the crema, the better the shot is likely to be. The heart of the shot is a dark, almost black, syrup-like layer beneath the crema.
Drink fast! Espresso begins to deteriorate within fifteen seconds of extraction.
Take the tiny cup, or demitasse, and slurp to throw the espresso against the back of your palate. Expect a shock. Espresso is one of the most astonishing taste sensations in the world, but if done right, is never bitter.
Keep slurping, tasting for elements such as spice, fruit, wood, or smoke. Every shot is slightly different.
Discuss your findings with your barista to see what he or she “gets” from the shot. Making an espresso is an art form for many baristas and you can learn a lot by engaging them in a discussion.

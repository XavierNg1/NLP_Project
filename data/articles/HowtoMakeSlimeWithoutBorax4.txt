 Be sure to do this in a microwave-safe bowl as you will be putting the mixture in the microwave later.
 This will be the color of your slime. It will not be diluted later. Stir thoroughly.
 Heat it on high for four to five minutes. Check on the mixture regularly to make sure that it does not boil over the bowl., The mixture should be relatively cool after this amount of time.
 The more times you repeat this process, the thicker your slime will be.
 Let it sit for 10 or so minutes. Make sure not to handle it before it is fully cooled as it will be very hot.You can place the slime on a plate or cutting board to cool.

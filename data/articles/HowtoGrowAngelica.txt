 Just be sure to plant quickly as the seeds lose viability quickly after harvesting. (Angelica seeds itself readily, so once it's growing, you should see it re-emerging continuously in your garden.) Alternatively, purchase a seedling from the nursery/garden centre.


Sprinkle the seeds into a seed-raising tray filled with seed-raising mix. Cover the seeds minimally. Keep moist across the entire tray. Wait for the seeds to germinate. This will take around 3-4 weeks but this varies. If you see no signs after 4 weeks, assume the seeds did not take and try with a new batch.
Division is another method for obtaining more angelica. Simply lift the plant when it is two years old, in the early spring. Divide the roots into smaller sections and replant immediately in loose, quality soil.
If planting new seedlings from a parent plant, plant them some distance away from the parent plant.;
, Angelica likes lightly shaded spots in the garden; however, if you have a cool climate, a full sun aspect is preferable. The soil should be fertile, drain well but remain moist.


Angelica can be grown successfully in containers.
, This plant originates from cool, rainy areas. Use mulch (rotted compost or old manure).
 An application of a complete plant food once in early spring as new growth appears and again in early summer will give angelica a boost.
 If you'd like to prolong the life of the plant, snip off the flowers when they appear. This can extend the life of the plant considerably beyond its 2 year normal lifespan.


Cut stems after the plant has bloomed to obtain the best flavour.

Dig out the roots just as the flowers are forming and wash clean straight away.
Seeds can be harvested once ripened. Cut off the whole flower head, place in a paper bag and leave to dry in a warm, dry place. The seeds will drop off. They can be stored in an airtight jar.
 This should be done to the stems before storing.

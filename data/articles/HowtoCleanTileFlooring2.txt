 Mix 1/2 cup vinegar with a gallon of water and proceed to mop as usual. If the floor still doesn't look as clean as you would like, mop the floor again using fresh water and detergent.









Rinse the floor with clean warm water after you are done washing it. It is important to remove all residual soap from the tiles so it doesn't remain on the floor to attract and hold dirt.
Do not use vinegar or chemicals on marble flooring. See How to Clean Marble for information on safely cleaning stone floors.
 If a spill is left to sit for awhile, it can stain your tile floor. Make a paste to spot clean the area.

Prepare a paste using a 50/50 mixture of scouring powder and warm water.













Rub the paste on the stain using a clean cloth, and then allow it to sit for five to 10 minutes.
Scrub the area with a soft brush, then wash the area with warm water and a cloth to remove all remains of the paste.













Repeat the process if the stain is still visible.
 Tile floors in bathrooms tend to get mildew sometimes. The best prevention method is to air out the room after you've showered and keep the floors dry. If mildew does accumulate, an ammonia solution should take care of it.

Put on a pair of rubber gloves to protect your hands. Make sure the room is well ventilated.
Prepare a 50/50 solution of water and ammonia.
Scrub the area using a soft brush and the ammonia solution.













Rinse the floor with clean water after the mildew is gone.
 You probably won't have to do this often, but if you do, cleaning with kerosene does the trick on rust.

Put on a pair of rubber gloves to protect your hands.
Dampen a clean cloth with kerosene.
Rub the rust stain away using the kerosene rag.













Wash the area with warm water to remove residual rust and kerosene, then repeat the process if the rust is not entirely gone.

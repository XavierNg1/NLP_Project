 Practice 100 punches/kicks a day. Don`t rush into it if you can`t do 100 punches yet do baby steps and eventually work up 100 punches/kicks. It can be any punch/kick as long as you're getting a workout. Be sure to use proper form. If you don't have a heavy bag punch the air. When your punches get good enough add wrist weights or dumbbells, but be careful, because they can hurt your joints. Remember to do them slowly.;
, Give your muscles a break for 1-3 days. Try to make your own routine. And use proper form. Never use ankles weights when kicking.
, Whether it be plyometrics or jumping over a chair. Just strengthen that explosive power.
 Go all out but play it safe.
 Practice your flips as much as you can and learn safe rolls.
 Find 200 yards (182.9Â m) of space and try to run it in the fastest time possible. Proper form is important.
 Practice drills with friends or homemade dummies. Look to a Martial Arts instructor, books, or online for help.
 Do dynamic stretches before a workout and static stretches to cool down after.
 Parkour can be practiced virtually anywhere.
, Make your own combinations too and don't work too hard because our bodies aren't as strong as Goku's.

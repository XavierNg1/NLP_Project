 Smart players will target your Pylons before going after other buildings. If your enemy forces manage to destroy a pylon, all the buildings within its power field will cease to function--unless, of course, you overlap pylons to extend power fields.
 Unlike Terran SCVs, your Probes do not need to tend to a building during construction. In fact, Probes don't "build" buildings; they warp them in. Once your Probe initiates the warp-in process, you can assign it to other jobs, like resource gathering. The building will appear on its own.
 As a Protoss player, your strength lies not in numbers, but in brute force. Two or three Protoss units are equal to twice as many Terran and Zerg units. Build up contingents of four to five combat units, then attack to keep up pressure on your opponents.
 The Sentry unit has an ability called Hallucination that creates illusions of combat units. To you, hallucinations appear translucent, but to your opponents, they look real. They cannot inflict any damage and they die quickly, but you can use them as decoys to keep your opponents busy while your real combat units wreak havoc.

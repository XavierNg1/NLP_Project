 Your mother might be controlling your life through your finances. If you are a teen, talk to your mom about getting a part time job to pay for any of the things she is using to control you, like your phone or car. If you are older, save up your money to move out and pay all your bills on your own., Try not to get so caught up in your relationship with your mom that you forget about your other relationships. Spend time alone doing the things that you enjoy. Hang out with your friends when you can to keep those connections strong, as well., If possible, limit the amount of time that you spend with your mother. If you still live at home, this will be difficult, but you can try to spend more time alone in your room or you can engage with her less. If you are living away from home, visit and answer her calls less often.When she asks why you’re distant, you can let her know that her controlling behavior has been stressing you out.
 If her controlling behavior is beginning to affect your health, then it might be time to cut the cords. If she has done something to negatively affect your work life or to harm your children, then distance may be necessary.If she shows to you at some point that she is able to change, then consider allowing her back into your life.
 Your mom’s domineering personality might have reached an unhealthy limit. If nothing seems to get her to back off, or if she is starting to harm you physically or emotionally, get help. Talk to a teacher or counselor about these issues. If your mom is open to change, see if she is willing to go to therapy with you.

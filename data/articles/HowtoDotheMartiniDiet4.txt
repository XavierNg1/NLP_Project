 Strong, mint-flavored breath strips should be popped into your mouth as soon as you feel a strong craving. Nothing tastes good right after eating a mint strip, which should be enough to kill the craving.
 Wearing white strips during the times of day when you are most susceptible to cravings will make it physically impossible for you to eat.
 Donâ€™t hesitate to use your best plates and a vase full of flowers, even for a leisurely lunch. Setting a beautiful table helps to stave off feelings of deprivation.

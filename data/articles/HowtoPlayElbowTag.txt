,, Each grouping can consist of 2 (a pair) or 3 or 4 players, depending on how many people you have available. Don't make the groupings any larger. Players should not be holding hands; just linking arms so that they form small human "chains" of 2, 3 or 4 people. These chains need to stretch out to keep the large circle shape.
 One person will be reserved as "It" and other person will be the runner.
 The objective is for "It" to tag the runner. The runner will be trying to get away and not become "It". A runner can avoid capture by joining one of the human chains - the runner is safe if he or she links arms onto one end of a human chain. However, when the runner joins a human chain, it sets off a chain reaction which forces the person on the opposite end of the human chain to become the next runner.
 The runner should immediately link with one of the human chains to have a rest! "It" will then start chasing the new runner.

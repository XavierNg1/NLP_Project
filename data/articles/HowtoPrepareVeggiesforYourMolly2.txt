 Lightly dry it off with a clean towel.
 Puncture little holes into it. That way, the steam can escape while the vegetable is cooking.
 Pour in 1/4 to 1/2 cup of cold water.
 Cook the squash/zucchini for 5 minutes in the microwave on full power. After it has cooked for five minutes, pierce the vegetable with a fork and see if it is tender. If it isn't tender yet, put it in for another 5 minutes.


The squash or zucchini may need to cook for up to 20 minutes in the microwave.
 Allow it to cool.
 If you've cooked it long enough, it should sink. However, If it doesn't, take the other pieces, and pop them into the microwave for another 5 minutes. Cook them in another 1/4 cup of water.
 They will be very happy!

 Try to make your throat passage nearly vertical. Tip your head enough that the water runs down your throat from the force of gravity alone. This way, you won't need to engage your throat muscles to physically suck the water down your gullet. You should be able to chug more quickly as a result.


Don't tip your head back forward until you're done chugging water. If you shift your throat passage while the water is still draining, then that water might be slowed by the muscle contraction. This can cause you to choke.
Never chug while lying down. Chugging while horizontal increases the likelihood that the water will slip into your windpipe, causing you to choke.
 If you feel your throat tense up, try to calm yourself. Do not make any swallowing motions, as these may actually slow the process. Pour at a steady rate to avoid a backup.


Be careful! It is easy to accidentally pour the water into your windpipe, which can cause a series of choking spasms.
 If you are drinking from a bottle, leave a small gap between your upper lip and the top of the mouth of the bottle. This will allow air to flow past the mouth of the bottle. If you have an air source other than the inside of the bottle, then you won't need to pull the water source away from your mouth to take a breath.

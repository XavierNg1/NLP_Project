 Peruse through fashion magazines, and online reviews for low cost cosmetics. This is your first and best step to finding makeup. You will find hundreds of helpful reviews from beginners to professionals online. But as always, don’t believe everything you read. You’ll never really know until you try it on yourself.


For good quality brands and products available at drugstores, read the products credits next to photos in fashion magazines. Professional makeup artists tend to use less expensive and readily available products., It can be overwhelming walking into a cosmetic department with so many options. To combat that, start by deciding on the look or products you are going for. Take into consideration your complexion, eye color, and hair color. Search out looks that are similar to those, to help prevent the confusion of color choice.


Skin tone breaks down into two types, yellow based (olive skin), and pink based (pinkish, peach skin). Do not let surface redness or scars confuse you. When you tan do you turn olive, bronze, or golden? If yes, you are yellow based. If you turn rosy, red, or a reddish brown, then you are pink based., Just because it claims to be the best of the best or look amazing in the bottle doesn’t mean it is. It’s always a good idea to test the product out before you buy it. See if it's possible to try the cosmetics on beforehand.

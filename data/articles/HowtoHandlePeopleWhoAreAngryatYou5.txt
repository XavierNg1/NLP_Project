 If you did something wrong, you may need to remedy the situation by apologizing and making amends. Don't try to make excuses for your behavior. If you did something to wrong the other party, you need to acknowledge your mistake.
Think about whether or not an apology is best during the interaction or later after s/he has calmed down.
Assess whether or not an apology would be heartfelt and meaningful to the situation. You should not apologize if you don't mean it, as this might escalate the problem further.
 You need to show the person that you have remorse for how your words or actions affected him or her.You may not have intended to make this person angry or hurt his or her feelings. Regardless of your intentions, you need to recognize that your behavior had a negative effect on the other person.
Frame your apology first around a statement of remorse. For example, you could start by saying "I am so sorry. I know I hurt your feelings."

, Your apology needs to include a statement about responsibility to be effective and diffuse the situation. In other words, you need to state how your actions contributed to the other personâ€™s feelings of hurt or frustration.A statement of responsibility may sound like "I am sorry. I realize that my being late made us miss the event"
Alternatively you could say "I am sorry. I know my carelessness caused you to fall"

, An apology is meaningless unless you state how the situation can be fixed or avoided in the future.An offer to remedy the situation can include an offer to help the other person or a means by which you not repeat the same mistake again in the future.
For example, you could say "I am sorry. I know my being late caused us to miss the event. From now on I will set an alarm on my phone an hour before I need to be ready".
Another example would be "I am sorry, I know my carelessness caused you to fall. I will pay better attention to where I put my belongings in the future."

 Your bulldog will need a high-quality food that is balanced in the nutrients dogs need. Read the ingredient list on the pet food label. If the first two or three ingredients are meat and not meat by-products, it’s probably a high quality food. The dog food label will also give the recommended amount of food to feed your bulldog daily. Use an actual measuring cup to measure this food out to make sure he eats properly for his size, age, and activity level.You can also ask your bulldog’s breeder or your veterinarian for their suggestions.
 When choosing food for your bulldog, do not get food that contains soy. Soy ferments and produces a lot of gas in the bowels, which can predispose the dog to bloat, so its best avoided., Always remember to leave clean, fresh water out for your bulldog at all times. Clean the water bowl about once a week or even more frequently. Running it through the dishwasher is a good way to sterilize the bowl.
 Buy a heavy duty stainless steel bowl. This can help reduce redness and rashes from developing on your bulldog’s face.

 Remember that alphabet song from Sesame Street? We both know that. How about "Sing! Sing a song, make it simple...", Whether you use karaoke, a choir, or lyrics, you can learn any song. Start with the easy stuff. People really don't mind a newbie coming in and singing "Somewhere, over the Rainbow", which is harder than it sounds., You might start off a composition with "bum, bum, badum, bum...bidabidabohduh" -- then translate that to quarter notes, eighths, and sixteenths. It started off in your head. Really? Can you find lyrics for it? Are you a poet, too?, Does it make duet harmony with your first? Does it naturally carry the same beat? Once your duet harmony works, you can work on third and fourth parts. Six duets are in four-part harmony, and they must all work., A decent headset, perhaps operable with your phone, can be had for thirty dollars in 2016. Professional quality stereo mic: ~180. The software to cut noise and add special effects can be anywhere from free (Audacity) to a rental (Adobe Audition). Record something...most memorable parts....hardest parts...parts that don't work. Fix them in your head. Rewrite them., It is easy to chuck stuff in your head: Just write a different part for it. Don't worry. If you really learned the melody, then working on counterpoint will hurt nothing. The good patterns will stick.

What matters is how much you chuck. If you didn't make two parts work when you were singing them together, then when you write them, you can transpose them. If you have the necessary range, then you can transpose them in your head. Even if you don't have the necessary range, you can transpose them in your imagination.

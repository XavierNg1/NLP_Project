 Ask yourself the question "what do we need to feel fulfilled when being served?". In the service world, you either do your job well or you make no money.;
, As a customer, we need to feel taken care of, we are paying to be pampered. Of course, the extent of pampering is dependent on the type of restaurant, as in McDonalds may not bring you a refill on a water, whereas another style of restaurant would do this. Customers are demanding they are paying to be served at the table. It is for this reason that the server needs to be able to adjust to all situations on the go.
 What you do is your livelihood. How you conduct yourself and convey it to others pays your bills and keeps food on your table.

Anticipate what people need before they have to think about it. This may seem difficult but it is really common sense. If the glass is half full, fill it, if the plate is empty, take it away and ask what else they need. Even if you know the answer, this makes the customer feel relaxed.

Be knowledgeable, understand the menu, and be able to show the customer your expertise in your line of work. The service industry is much underrated, but not everyone can do it.

Know your customers and let situations dictate the kind of service that is needed. Business professionals on lunch want to be left alone to conduct business. They may not want to sit and chat. A birthday party may require a lot of attentiveness. You could make a great or bad memory for the customerâ€™s special day.

Do not act over-eager. Show the customer that they matter. If they feel that, they will reward you. When they think, you are just there to see what is left on the table, you may not see much there. Always remember it is gratuity, the customers have already paid for the food.

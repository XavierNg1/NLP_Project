 It's entirely up to you., Why? Because you'll be less hungry later. That leads to eating fewer calories per day, as did a group of overweight women to whom St. Louis University researchers gave two scrambled eggs and two slices of toast with jelly for breakfast. Another group ate more calories during the day after consuming half as much protein at breakfast.
 Make yourself climb to the attic or go downstairs to the basement to get to your less-healthy snacks. Put your most tempting foods "out of reach and out of sight". Cornell University food psychologist Brian Wansink, PhD, keeps his favorite sodas in a refrigerator in the basement.
 You will consume fewer calories at a well-lit restaurant table than in a dark corner. "In the light, you're more conscious of the other patrons what you eat," explains Wansink.
 Avoid snacks in variety packs. Why, you may want to try several., People given ten colors of M&Ms to munch on versus seven eat 30% more! says Wansink

, Less sleep can cause the release of hormones that increase appetite, according to researchers.
 Scientists have scanned the brains of people eating different foods and found that the brain reacts to fats in the mouth in a similar way as it responds to pleasant aromas.
 The more food you see, the more you eat. Pack up half of your restaurant meal before eating. That half will make a great meal later.
 That limits your time to eat. You'll have food left on your plate when others are finished. Tell yourself you're finished, too. Eat the leftovers for another meal.
 In other words, don't "eat on the run." You'll eat fewer calories if you're conscious and watchful of what you eat.
 Start lunch with around 100 calories worth of vegetable soup (not a rich stew), and you'll eat 20% fewer calories overall during lunch. This is according to Penn State experts.

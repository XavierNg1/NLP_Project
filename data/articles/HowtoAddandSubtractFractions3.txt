 A mixed fraction is when you have a whole number and a fraction, like in the above example (1 5/12). Meanwhile, an improper fraction is one where the numerator (the top number) is bigger than the denominator (the bottom number). That's also seen in the above step, with 17/12.


For the example for this section, let's work with 13/12 and 17/8.
 Remember the three ways you can find the LCD? By either writing out the multiples, using prime factorization, or by multiplying the denominators.


Let's figure out the multiples of our example, 12 and 8. What's the smallest number these two go into? 24. 8, 16, 24 and 12, 24 – bingo!

, Both denominators now need to be turned into 24. How do you get 12 to 24? Multiply it by 2. 8 to 24? Multiply it by three. But don't forget – you need to multiply the numerators, too!


So 13 x 2/12 x 2 = 26/24. And 17 x 3/8 x 3 = 51/24. We're well on our way to solving the problem!

, Now that you have the same denominator, you can add these two numbers together with ease. Remember, leave the denominator alone!


26/24 + 51/24 = 77/24. There's your one fraction! That top number is mighty big, though.
 Having such a large number on top is a little weird – you can't quite tell the size of your fraction. All you have to do is put the denominator into the numerator until in can't be repeated again and then see what you have leftover.


For this example, 24 goes into 77 three times. That is, 24 x 3 = 72. But there's 5 leftover! So what's your final answer? 3 5/24. That's it!

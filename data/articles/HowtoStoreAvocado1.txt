 You can skip the paper bag, but placing an unripe avocado in a paper bag will speed up the ripening process.


Without the paper bag, an avocado can take up to 7 days to ripen.With the paper bag, this time frame drops down to 3 to 5 days.






To speed the process up even more, place an apple or banana in the bag alongside the avocado. This will drop the time frame down to 2 to 3 days.






A brown paper bag traps ethylene gas produced by ripening fruit. Apples and bananas produce ethylene hormone in excess as they ripen, so placing an avocado in a bag with either of these fruits will cause all the fruit in that bag to ripen faster.





;
, Place the avocado on the counter or in a pantry, out of direct sunlight.


Ideally, the avocado should be kept in temperatures between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 and 24 degrees Celsius).
Do not refrigerate the unripe avocado. Refrigeration dramatically slows the ripening process, and as a result, your avocado may not ripen correctly or quickly.
 Give the avocado a light squeeze to determine how close it is to becoming ripe. A ripe avocado should yield slightly when gentle pressure is applied.


Avocados can be kept at room temperature for about a week if you start with an unripe one.






The avocado should only give a little when you press it. If you press the skin with your thumb and it leaves a bruise or deep, permanent indentation, the avocado may already be over-ripe.

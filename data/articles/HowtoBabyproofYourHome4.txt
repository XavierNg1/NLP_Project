 Clean up any small or dangerous bits of trash that your baby/child might try to eat.
 Keep toys, games, coins, balloons, and wrappers out of reach of children.
,,,,, As a parent you want what's best for your child and you may think about providing a soft bedding. This, however, is considered to be serious safety hazard. Cozy and fluffy bedding can cover your baby's face during sleep- causing breathing problems. Therefore, remove soft bedding, such as extra pillows, comforters and soft toys in the crib before your child's sleep., Toys like jumping ropes, puzzles and containing other small objects are a red light and are heavily dangerous to a child. When consumed, small toy parts can block the air getting in and out of the lungs and cause dangerous chocking. Furthermore, all cables and chargers and anything long and flexible can be dangerous to a child, so make sure all household cables/strings are hidden and out of reach. Avoid purchasing toys with overwhelming amount of moving parts so you can memorize all of them and keep an eye on missing ones.

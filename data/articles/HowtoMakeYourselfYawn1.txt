 Just thinking about yawning can cause your body to want to yawn. Prime yourself for yawning by imagining yourself doing so. Look at the word "yawn" and think about how it feels to have a good, deep yawn.;
, Pretend like you're going to yawn, even if you don't feel one coming on. Open your mouth as wide as you can. Just getting in position to yawn can be enough to prompt an actual yawn to form.
 These muscles naturally contract a little when you yawn. Contracting them now may stimulate your body to form a real yawn. Your brain will connect the feeling of these muscles contracting with the act of yawning.
 Just as you would with a real yawn, breathe in through your mouth. Breathe quite deeply and slowly, rather than taking a quick, shallow breath, since real yawns allow you to take in a lot of air.
 With your mouth and throat in position, a real yawn is likely to kick in at this point. Your body will naturally want to yawn when your mouth is open, your throat is slightly contracted and you've taken a good deep breath. If you still can't yawn, try the next method.

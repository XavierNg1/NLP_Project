 Even many people who bake regularly use a strainer instead of a hand-crank sifter. A small strainer minimizes the amount of mess created. If you only have a wide strainer, such as one for draining vegetables, only use a spoonful or two of sugar at a time to prevent it falling around your bowl rather than into it.


Note that colanders, which drain through holes instead of a wire mesh, do not typically have small enough holes to prevent sugar lumps from falling through.
 If you do not have a sifter or strainer, stirring with a whisk or fork can help you find lumps to remove manually, but this will not be very effective. However, if you are instructed to sift all the dry ingredients in a baking recipe together, whisking them with a whisk or fork is a fine alternative. Just like sifting, whisking adds air to make the mixture fluffier, and helps mix the ingredients evenly together., Sometimes, bakers sift powdered sugar over cookies or other small treats as tasty decoration. A mesh tea strainer may actually work better than a sifter for this purpose, since it shakes the sugar only over a small area.Make sure the tea strainer is well-cleaned and dry, with no strong aroma.

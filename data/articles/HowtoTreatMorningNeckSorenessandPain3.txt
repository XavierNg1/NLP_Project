 The ice should only be applied in the first twenty-four hours of the injury at twenty minute increments.
Â Heat will help to stimulate blood flow into the neck allowing it to heal. This can be done by taking a warm shower after waking up or by applying direct heat.


In the shower allow the warm water to run over your neck for at least four to five minutes. Do not move your neck around and keep it straight as you do this.
If you prefer solid heat apply a heating pad/wrap to the sore area on low heat continuously.
 Taking an anti-inflammatory medication, such as ibuprofen, will reduce the inflammation of the tissue and cause less pain while a pain reliever such as acetaminophen will also reduce the perception of pain.
 It is often helpful to have someone help you with this step. After waking up, use your fingers to apply light pressure to the shoulders and neck in small circular motions. Then, using firm pressure, massage the neck and shoulders in a downward motion. This will help to relax the tissue and stimulate blood flow in the neck.
 Applying gentle traction to the neck can often ease and elongate tight muscles, allowing pinched nerves or compressed blood vessels to be released. Tight muscles can constrict and tighten muscles around them and cause morning neck aches.
 Soaking in Epsom salt can relieve pressure and pain in muscles. Epsom Salt must contain Magnesium Sulfate to be effective. Soak in bath for 15-20 minutes.
 By stimulating pressure point located between the knuckles of your pointer and middle finger, pressure can be released to treat pain.

 Your first step after painting should be to evaluate the curtains and blinds you have in the room. Curtains, blinds, and other window treatments have the effect of darkening a room. By making small changes, you’ll bring more light into your dark room.


Remove fabric valances to allow more light in.
Take down curtains if they’re limiting the light that can come in.
Replace dark colored blinds with light colored blinds.
Keep your curtains or blinds open to allow a lot of natural light to enter the room.;
, The simplest way to brighten a dark room is by installing more light fixtures. Placed appropriately, your light fixtures will temper your dark paint and help you create an airy feel.


Have an electrician install recessed lighting, if you want.
Use desk or table lamps to add more light.
Add free standing lights to the darkest areas of your room., If you have a part of the room that is particularly dark, like an accent wall, you can focus your light there. This will temper the darkness of that part of the room.


Place a free-standing light near an accent wall.
If you have “eyeball” recessed lighting, point it toward the dark area of the room., Another way to brighten a room is to control the type of light your light fixtures give off. While traditional incandescent lightbulbs give off a yellow or goldish light, other types of lights spread a brighter and whiter light.


Use LED light bulbs.
Pick incandescent or other lights that are labeled “white” or “bright.”
Choose the brightest bulbs your fixture can safely handle. For example, if the fixture can take a 100- watt bulb, don’t use a 60-watt bulb in it.

 Look at the inside of a ring’s band to find the hallmark that indicates the platinum purity. Find this marking as a sure way to determine that the ring is truly made of platinum.


You may need a magnifying glass to see the fine engraving on a small ring.
If there is no engraved hallmark, the ring is not platinum, or is made with less than 50% of it and cannot be considered and marked as platinum.;
, Check the inner band for a symbol that you can use to quickly identify if the ring is made with real platinum. The type and presence of the symbol depends on the country of origin; sometimes there may only be words and numbers instead of a symbol.


In the U.S., you will see a symbol that resembles a house shape (triangle atop a rectangle), or simply a combination of letters and numbers.
In India, you will find a symbol created by an uppercase “P” and a lowercase “t,” followed by the number 950.
In China, you will find the English letters “Pt,” perhaps alongside other Chinese characters.
In Japan, you will see “Pt” followed by the number 850, 900, 950, or 999., Look at the numbers and/or letters that are given as part of the platinum hallmark. The letters will designate the ring as platinum, while the numbers indicate how many parts out of 1000 are pure platinum by weight.


If letters are given, they will say either PT, PLAT, or PLATINUM, which indicates that the ring is at least 95% platinum.In the U.S., the number given before or after these letters can be 850, 900, or 950. This indicates that the ring is made with 85%, 90%, or 95% pure platinum, respectively. The other percentage of the ring composition is a metal that the platinum is alloyed with to make it harder.

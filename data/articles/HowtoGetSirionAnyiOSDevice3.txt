 You will need to jailbreak your iDevice in order to install Cydia. Cydia will allow you to download a port of the Siri program that can work on your iDevice. This port will connect to an unauthorized Siri server in order to process the Siri data.


You must be running iOS 5.1.1 or later.
Older devices may have difficulties running this program. If your device crashes and becomes unstable, you may need to restore it.
 Add the SiriPort repository to your Cydia sources so that you can access the file. Tap Manage > Sources > Edit > Add. Enter "http://repo.siriport.ru" into the box that appears. Tap "Add Source" to start adding the repository.
 After it has been added, search for the "Siriport (original) iOS 6" package. Install the package and then reboot your iOS device.
 Look for the entry SiriPort.ru. You may have to scroll down to find it. Select the entry, and then tap the "Install Certificate" button. A Safari window will open showing the Install Profile page.


Tap Install, and then tap the next Install button. Once you do, you will be taken to the Profile Installed Page. Look for the word “Trusted” printed in green letters. Tap Done and close out of Safari.
 There will be a delay when you first start the SiriPOrt, because it has to communicate with servers overseas. If you cannot get it to start, release the Home button, reboot your iDevice, and try again.

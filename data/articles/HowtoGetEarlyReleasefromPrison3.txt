 If you have a child whose caregiver dies or becomes incapacitated, or if you are the only possible caregiver for your own spouse or registered partner who becomes incapacitated, you can request an early release from prison in order to care for that person. To make your request, explain the details in writing in a letter to the prison warden.


Your letter should include your plan for how you will provide for this person if you are released, and should include copies of a death certificate or medical records to prove death or incapacity., Inmates may be considered for early release if they are suffering from a debilitating or terminal medical condition. You can make your request to a member of the prison staff, who shall be obligated to pass your request along to the prison warden. You will be considered for a compassionate release if you have been given a life expectancy of no more than 18 months, or if you are confined to a bed or chair for more than 50% of waking hours and are limited in your ability to care for yourself., Some elderly inmates may be eligible for a reduction of sentence based only on their advanced age. You may be eligible for early release if you are:


Age 70 or older, have served at least 30 years, and were sentenced on or after November 1, 1978;
Age 65 or older, have served at least 50% of your sentence, and have a serious and irreversible aging-related medical condition; or
Age 65 or older and have served the greater of 10 years or 75% or your sentence.

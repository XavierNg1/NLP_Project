 Here's what you need to get started:


A laptop or a desktop computer. Approximately one per four children is needed, although in the home environment, this will depend on the availability of computers and how the children like working together.
Paper and pens. This lets children take notes to share. Remember too that writing on paper has a mind and body connection that is different from typing, and many creative people insist that this connection sparks different ways of thinking, so encourage both.
Webcam, microphone, creative software for graphics manipulation/videos/music making, etc.
 Approximately half an hour to an hour will be needed for your first SOLE session. Choose a time that is relaxed, when school homework is out of the way and when your child or children are likely to be engaged.


You might like to treat this as special time spent together, as you might read quietly nearby or simply be present somewhere in the vicinity. Or, you can get on with the cleaning or cooking while your children are happily investigating the answers (the investigation stage is hands-off, although keeping an eye on progress is recommended).
 Switch off the TV and any other electronic distractions not related to the computers being used for research. Have the children sit or hang out somewhere that is comfortable and enjoyable in the home. This is a fun experience, so it's important for the children to feel comfortable.

 Limit the amount of moving around you do right after the injury occurs. Injured ligaments should be well rested to promote faster healing and to avoid further injury. Make sure to avoid placing any excessive pressure on your MCL, as this could cause further complications.Another way to avoid damaging your knee further is to avoid exposing your knee to hot temperatures for at least 48 hours after the injury occurs. Hot temperatures could cause your knee to swell up and become even more tender.;
, Your doctor may recommend that you wear a knee brace for a period of time (the length of time depends on how badly the knee was injured). A brace can help to keep your knee stable, which in turn can keep further damage from occurring.
 Use an ice compress to do this. Cold temperatures can help to numb the area so you feel less pain, while also restricting the flow of blood to the area, which can help to bring the swelling down.


Do not place an ice pack or ice directly against your skin; make sure to wrap it in a hand towel first to avoid damaging your skin. Hold the ice pack against your knee for 15 to 20 minutes, then let your knee rest.You can repeat this process throughout the day.
 You should elevate your knee above the level of your heart; doing this can help to keep the amount of swelling that occurs to a minimum. Continue to elevate your knee as much as possible for at least 48 to 72 hours after the injury occurs.You can use a pillow to prop up your leg.

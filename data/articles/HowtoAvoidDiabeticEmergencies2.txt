 One of the best ways to avoid diabetic emergencies is to commit to a healthier lifestyle and managing your diabetes. This includes eating healthy foods that are approved by your doctor or dietician and staying away from foods that cause blood sugars to spike. You should also make exercise a daily routine.Avoid foods and drinks with sugar or refined and simple carbs. This includes junk food, such as snack cakes, ice cream, crackers, chips, white pasta, white bread, and similar items.
Talk to your doctor about adopting an exercise program right for you. Good ideas for exercise include walking, yoga or Tai Chi, dancing, gardening, and riding a stationary bike.

 One way to help avoid emergencies is to wear a diabetes identification item. This may be a bracelet, necklace, or other item on your body. This lets people know that you have diabetes in case your symptoms have made it so that you cannot speak.You can buy medical alert items on the internet or in a pharmacy.
 Staying hydrated is extremely important when you have diabetes. If you are experiencing high blood sugar, you can easily get dehydrated because your body is making more urine. Another problem that can arise with diabetes is diabetic ketoacidosis.

 Some rental car companies will provide you with a discount if you pay for the entire rental up-front, rather than when you pick-up or return the car. This can be especially helpful when the car you’re renting has unlimited mileage, so you know the price you’re paying up-front will not change later., Most car rental agencies have loyalty programs that give points to frequent renters. Signing up for such programs is usually free, and may even provide other advantages (e.g. easier checkin, etc.).Most of these loyalty programs work for any rental you book worldwide, as long as it’s with the same agency.
If you rent cars frequently, but don’t always use the same agency, sign-up for more than one loyalty program so you always receive points.
Be careful as points can expire, or memberships can become inactive, if you don’t meet certain criteria.
 Car rental agencies will charge a lower price per day the longer you rent a car. For example, booking a car for 1 week will be cheaper than if you book it for 6 days. If you’re able to book a car for a longer period of time, you’ll pay less per day.

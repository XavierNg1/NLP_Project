 Google Scholar can keep track of any particular search terms you are interested in. When new sources using those terms are added to its database, it will send you an email with citation information for those services. To sign up for these alerts, just click the small envelope icon at the bottom of the left-hand menu on a page of Google Scholar search results, then enter the email address you want to use.For instance, creating an alert for ‘Vietnamese cultural traditions’ will send you an email anytime Google Scholar finds new sources using those key terms.
 If you are logged into your Google account, you can save citation information for interesting sources you find to make it easier to retrieve them later. Just click “Save” at the bottom of a source’s citation information, and Google Scholar will add it to the feature called “My library.”You can access the “My library” feature from the top center of the Google Scholar main page, or from the left-hand menu from a page of search results.
 Google Scholar is free to use and intuitive to operate. It can be useful for running initial searches and for general research. However, you may need to account for some of its limitations when doing research. For example:Many of its search results are restricted.
You cannot limit by the type of source you want to find (e.g., books only, or articles only).
You cannot know which databases Google Scholar uses to find its search results.
There are sometimes errors in the way Google Scholar records data (e.g., journal names may mistakenly be listed as authors)
Some results that Google Scholar retrieves (such as personal web pages, non-peer-reviewed articles, etc.) may not be traditionally-defined scholarship.

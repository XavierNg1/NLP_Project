 You can use as many threads as wished, 2,3,4,5,6â€“however many pieces of yarn you need. This article demonstrates the technique using 4 pieces. The pieces don't have to be the same size, weight etc.;
, Put the yarns together and twist them. If you like the way that it looks, then you are ready to go.
 Close the bag but leave a small opening that allows the yarn to come through. Use paper clips or bulldog clips to close the bag.
 Knot the yarn around the needle and start casting on. Keep knitting as many stitches as you need. The best way to use this technique is to make a scarf because it doesn't really matter how big or how little it is. Otherwise, just make a swatch to see how many stitches you get to an inch, and then you can make a sweater or any other garment wished.
 Once done, you are ready to purl back or knit back, depending on what stitch you want. A couple of rows of garter stitch are always good when starting a scarf, for instance.
 Use these; slip the first stitch, knit the second with the tail, the third with the tail, and the fourth with the tail. Drop it. You can cut if off later; for now it is not going to go anywhere because it is now woven in.
 Turn the work around and knit back. When you get to the end stitches that you have knitted in double, don't separate them, so knit them together. Knit the last stitch.

 Talk to your partner when you get home from work or before bed. Ask them how their day was, and share an interesting detail or a funny story from your own day. Don’t worry about finding “important” things to talk about. Just stay in the habit of communicating with your partner regularly., Even though you know your partner well, avoid assuming you know what they need or want. Trying to be a mind reader almost never works. Instead, ask your partner what they need from you.Be straightforward. Say something like, “I know you’ve been really busy taking care of your mom lately. What is the best way I can help you feel less overwhelmed?”

, When you talk with your partner, pay attention to what they’re saying. Remove all distractions — turn off the television, put away your smartphone — and make eye contact so they know you are listening. Make them feel understood by rephrasing their words and pausing for clarification when you’re not sure what they mean. Avoid just waiting for them to finish talking so you can talk again.For instance, if your partner has just finished telling you about his difficulty getting everything done, you could rephrase by saying, “It sounds like you’re feeling really overworked.”
Asking good questions is another important part of active listening.
 Let your partner know that you’re always there for them if they need you. Emphasize that you’ll be happy to make their life easier if you can.Many caregivers don’t like asking for or accepting help from others, so you may need to remind your partner more than once that you welcome opportunities to help them out.

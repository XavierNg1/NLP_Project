 You'll need the following ingredients to make simple boiled new potatoes:


1 pound new potatoes
Butter, for serving
Salt and pepper, for serving

, Scrub off any dirt, and cut off bruised or pitted parts.
 Set the pot under the faucet in your sink and add water to completely cover the potatoes.

Before placing the potatoes in the pot, using a sharp knife draw a thin line around the potato. Make sure you don't press it too hard. Just a thin line around the potato that divides the potato into 2 different segments.
 Turn the burner to medium high.
 Lower the temperature and cook on medium low for about fifteen minutes. The potatoes are finished cooking when they are tender when pierced with a fork.


Monitor the potatoes closely as they cook, so the water does not boil over the top of the pot.
 Pour the potatoes into a colander, or use the pot's lid to strain the water from the pot over the sink.


If you want to peel the potato, start by peeling the center where you drew a line before boiling it. Once you start peeling from the center, the skin automatically comes away.
 Toss with pieces of butter and salt and pepper to taste.


Alternatively, slice the potatoes and use them to make Salad Nichoise.






Another option is to toss the potatoes with oils and spices and make a New Potato Salad.

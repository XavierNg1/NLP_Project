 A flat, wide open space is ideal for this game. If you’re playing outside, use hula hoops to create a three by three grid with the hoops in the shape of a tic tac toe board. If playing indoors, use masking tape to mark out the game board on the floor. Use chalk to draw the board on cement., Each team should have three players. Give each player two bean bags. Teammates should have the same color bean bags, but opposing teams should have different colors bags.
 Set a start marker, like a cone, on opposing sides of the board, with each marker 15 feet (4.6 m) away from the game board. Each teams should line up behind a single start marker.


Feel free to adjust the distance between the start markers and game board. A longer relay may be more suitable for older players, and shorter ones younger children., Have a judge yell “1, 2, 3 – go!” Players might also start on a three count. Once the signal is given, players should run to the board and place their marker in an open square. When that player returns and high-fives the next teammate in line back at the start marker, that teammate can run to place their marker and return to tag the next player, and so on.


Players should continue to run the relay until one team gets three squares in a row or the game ends in a draw., After two games, shuffle players between teams to keep things fresh and exciting. Have players track their wins. After several rounds, have a special Round of Champions between the players who have the most combined wins. The winning team will be the Grand Champions.

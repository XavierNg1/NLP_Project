 To make your lashes more pliable and likely to hold a curl, you should start by applying mascara. Use your favorite mascara, but make sure that it’s a waterproof formula because they typically do a better job of helping to hold a curl.








Apply two to three thin coats of mascara to ensure that your lashes look as full and long as possible.
 In order for your fingers to curl your lashes, they’ll need to be warm. Place your fingertips together, and rub them back and forth against one another several times to heat them gently.
 When your fingertips are warm, close your eyes and use your fingers to gently push your lashes back against lid. Press them so they’re going up toward your brow, and hold in place for 10 to 15 seconds.








If your lashes aren’t curled enough when you’re finished, rewarm your fingertips and repeat the process until you’re happy with the curl.

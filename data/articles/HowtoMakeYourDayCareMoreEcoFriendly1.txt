 Refrain from using chemicals as much as possible.


Use alternatives to cleaning with chlorine bleach. Peroxide-based bleach, quaternary ammonia, and borax are all safer options for the environment and the children.
One multi-purpose green cleaner is ionized acidic water from a water ionizer. When made at 2.7 pH, ionized acidic water has been lab tested and proven to kill E.Coli and staph bacteria on contact. It is safe and effective on plastic toys, countertops, floors, glass, toilets, door handles and even on the skin so no gloves or masks are needed. You can make it for pennies on the gallon by hooking a water ionizer up to your tap and filling a plastic spray bottle with it.
Refrain from buying aerosol spray cans. Instead, create your own air fresheners using essential oils and baking soda.
Create your own cleansing products from ingredients you can trust rather than purchasing cleaners full of chemicals.
Mix ingredients such as vinegar, borax, mild detergent, antibacterial essential oil and water to make products such as window cleaner, mold and mildew remover, carpet spot cleaner and all-purpose cleaner.;

 Hold your gaze a little longer than you’re used to but don’t stare.









Only try this during a non-essential moment of the movie. If your date is watching attentively, you might miss your chance.
Be sure you’ve already broken the touch barrier; kissing shouldn’t be attempted before things like handholding.;
, Your body language will let your date know that a kiss is in order.









If your gaze isn’t returned, just smile and look back at the movie. Don’t give up hope yet; your date might just be nervous.
 Starting off with a closed-mouth kiss is a safe bet; it’s better to leave them wanting more than to scare them away with unexpected tongue.









If you panic at the last second and don’t move in for the kiss, just laugh it off and try again later. This will break the tension and keep the pressure off.
If you plan to kiss; you and your date might want to head to the back. Nothing ruins a moment more than getting ugly stares from the people around you.

 Make sure to use it often to keep your skin soft, smooth and moisturized. Try Warm Vanilla Sugar body lotion from Bath and Body Works. It'll be hard to pull off your new apparel if you don't look good. You might get rude comments such as, "You see what too much candy does to you?" (but remember, you don't care what other people think).
 Try Cotton Candy lip gloss from Bath and Body Works.
 Whether you want sweet designs or sweet patterns, it's your choice.
 No matter how good your accessory looks, you'll never pull it off if you have bad hair. Get your hair professionally done at least once a month. Suggestions: headbands and barrettes for straight hair, bows for ponytails, and colorful beads for braids.
, Don't wear a shirt with a simple lollipop or cupcake - act like you're advertising a brand of candy, such as Skittles or Hershey's. Custom-made shirts are fine, too -- they increase uniqueness. Skirts, socks, and shoes should have sweet patterns in bright colors. As for pants, go for jeans with a cute belt.
 Dessert-themed accessories are must haves. You'll need earrings, necklaces, bracelets, headphones, rings, hair stuff, and bags that have a sweet design. Good online stores to get them are It'sugar, Etsy and CherryRedBoutique.
 Celebrities like Nicki Minaj or Katy Perry who have a sweet style are perfect for your image. Look at their fashions and accessories for inspiration, such as Katy Perry's cupcake headband or Nicki Minaj's ice cream necklace. Also follow their beliefs, whether they are confident, sassy, hopeful, or anything else. Watch their documentaries to find out.

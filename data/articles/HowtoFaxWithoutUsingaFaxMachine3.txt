 Consider what comprises the traditional machine: A simple black-and-white scanner, an electronic connection from one location to another—aka a phone line, and a thermal printer that even in 1984 was antique technology. Today, those same tools might laying around your home or office: a computer, a full-color inkjet printer, a high-resolution, low-cost flatbed scanner, and broadband internet. It's like a fax machine on steroids!


You may not have a printer—so many things these days just don't need to be printed, so why bother? But printers do have advantages. With the quality they deliver, you aren't limited to printing out black-and-white reports or blurry pictures of your niece and nephew—with the right paper (and a modicum of talent), your photos could be worthy of framing.
Likewise with a scanner. If you never have to scan a document, you don't need one of these, but they come in handy for many other things besides faxing—scanning old photos of yourself for Facebook, doing "art scans" of your face pressed against the glass, etc. They're also useful for scanning your signature, priceless old documents that you love to look at but don't want to handle too much, etc.
If you do a lot of printing and scanning, an all-in-one printer has pretty much everything you need: printing, scanning, even faxing the old-fashioned way—with a phone line! (Assuming, of course, that you have phone service).
Most online fax services have mobile apps available on the Google Plan and Apple market. This allows you to send or receive faxes from anywhere, you literally only need internet access if you download one of these apps. Here is a list of the mobile faxing apps available with links to download them straight on to your phone: Fax Services with Mobile Apps

, Stir until the dry ingredients are mixed properly.
 In a large bowl cream the butter, white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and the pudding mix using a hand or electric blender. Cream the ingredients until they are light and fluffy and there are no butter clumps. Crack the eggs in, one at a time. Blend again until there are no egg streaks.


You can also use a whisk to cream the mixture but do note it may take longer.

Take caution not to over-mix the cookie dough. Over-mixing will cause the cookies to become greasy and have a darker color. , In four different plastic containers, separate the cookie dough into four equally sized pieces. Add 5 drops of food coloring gel to the first container and mix using a wooden spoon until the color reveals itself. Repeat the process again using the other 3 colors.
 Continue until there is no more dough.

 If you're only hanging things in your closet, you could probably be using the space better. Move the hanging items to one side and then place a shelving unit into the closet. Use shelves, baskets, and small drawers to arrange your clothing. Try to include all of the space in the closet, even the floor and the ceiling.You can install ceiling racks that hang down.
If you don't have much hanging space in your closet, consider placing an open clothes rack in the bedroom itself.
 You may have a mirror hanging behind your bedroom door. If you don't (or it's a small mirror), install small racks or pegs, so you can hang things behind the door. For example, hang pegs so you can store your laundry hamper or jackets.


Don't forget to use your closet doors for storage too. This works best if your closet doors open out, rather than slide across.
 You can purchase long, short storage boxes or clear bins to put underneath your bed. This is a great way to store things that you don't need to access on a daily basis. Consider storing unseasonable clothing or outerwear under your bed in zippered storage boxes or canvas storage bags.You can even buy beds that have built-in shelving below them. These are sometimes sold as captain's beds which are raised up on storage platforms.
 Instead of storing your small accessories in boxes that are difficult to get to, place them in plain sight. Frame pegboard or cork board and hang it on the wall. You can arrange and display jewelry, ties, scarves, or cuff links from the pegboard or cork board.Consider painting the frame to match the colors in your room.
You can hang several of these in different sizes throughout your bedroom.

 In order to reach a sense of peace about your grades, determine how big of an impact the bad grade will have overall on your college career. In some cases, a bad quiz grade won't do much to destroy your average. If you failed one or more classes, you may have dropped your GPA. Instead of getting upset, take a few deep breaths and look at the big picture, making concrete plans to fix what you can.If you’re in your first year of college, you may be able to recover easily from a bad semester.You can calculate what grades you will need from this point on to achieve your ideal GPA. This can give you a sense of what can be done in the future.
 Perhaps you’ve determined that you have poor study skills. Maybe you realize that your notes are disorganized or that you keep forgetting due dates. Once you have identified these issues, you can take steps to fix them. Make a commitment to change.


If you are forgetful, you can buy a calendar, mark down important dates, and set reminders on your phones.
If you have time management problems, you can make a schedule and reward yourself with treats when you finish tasks.
 Identify where you want to be when you graduate? Is there a career you want? Do you want to be making a certain amount of money? Do you want to apply to graduate school? Create a list of manageable goals. After you decide on a few, list some practical steps towards attaining those goals.


For example, if you want to apply to medical school, you should keep a list of what courses you need to take, what GPA you need when you graduate, and what extracurriculars look good on a medical school application. Your list of practical steps should also include things like “Study for the MCAT” or “Research good medical schools.”

, Part of the process is understanding that while you can’t change the past, you can change the future. Reassure yourself that you can fix your problems. Once you know what you have done wrong, you can start taking steps to improving.

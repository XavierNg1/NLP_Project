 The slipknot is the start to your crochet pattern – the knot that holds the yarn to your needle as you work. To tie the knot:








Drape the yarn with the tail end in the palm of your hand, wrapped around the top of your index finger and under your middle finger.
Wrap the yarn back over the top of your index, behind the first loop.
Pull a loop from the center of the piece of yarn, and tuck this through the center of the large loop you’ve made around your fingers.
Place the new small loop on the crochet hook, and pull the tail of the yarn to tighten it.
 The foundation chain is simply the first row of chain stitches you create. Because you’re crocheting a hat, the foundation chain will not be very long – only five stitches to start.









To crochet your first stitch, hold the tail end of your slipknot and slide the hook forward, so that there is plenty of space on the end. Wrap the yarn around the end of the hook once, and then pull the hook backwards through the original slipknot. You’ve completed your first stitch! Repeat this five times to create your foundation chain., This will finish your foundation row, by hooking it back in a loop. Stick the end of your hook through the center of the first stitch, and do a single stitch (as per usual).
 As you crochet, you’ll need to keep count of your stitches. To do so, you’ll need to know where your row started.There are two general methods for marking the starting point: tie a piece of string around the first stitch in the second row, or slide a bobby pin over the stitch. When you get back to this part of each row, you will know you’ve completed an entire row of stitches.

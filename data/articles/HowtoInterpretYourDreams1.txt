 Dream interpretation is more meaningful when you have a clear picture of your dreams, rather than a string of hazy images that you struggle to recall. Remembering your dreams clearly is much easier when you get a good night's sleep and take measures to remember as much as possible.



Keep a dream journal next to your bed and write down everything you remember of your dreams on waking. Make this a daily morning ritual before doing anything else.
Write down everything, even if it doesn't make sense. The things that don't make sense or seem out of place may end up being the most valuable insights.;
, It might be tempting to connect separate symbols in your dreams by overlaying them with a plot of sorts, in order to make more sense of it all. Avoid this temptation, since you could obscure the real meaning of your dream.
 Your dreams are reflections of yourself and belong to you. While dream dictionaries and dream interpretation aids can be of some assistance in a very general way, the real nitty gritty of understanding what your dream means will always come down to you, your personal circumstances and the context of the dream and your waking life.

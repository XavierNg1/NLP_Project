 Regardless of the topic of your post, don’t make the readers search for your main message. Have a one- or two-sentence conclusion at the end of each post to help sum everything up.;
, If you try to use a voice that you don’t feel comfortable with, it will show through in your writing. Instead, only write about things that you can express passionately, knowledgeably, and comfortably.
 Generally, you should keep your voice professional unless you’re being intentionally colloquial or satirical to make a point. However, this could differ depending on the group of people you want to reach.

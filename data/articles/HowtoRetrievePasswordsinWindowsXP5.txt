 Use this method if you’re unable to get the user’s password with other methods. This method won’t allow you to find or reset the password, but you can access the user’s files so that their data is not lost. You’ll need administrative access to another Windows computer for this to work.

You will be temporarily removing the hard drive from the Windows XP PC and installing it in the second PC. To use this method, you’ll need to have some familiarity with removing a hard drive from a PC as well as putting a hard drive in an external USB hard drive enclosure.
If you don’t have an enclosure, you could also put the hard drive in the other PC.
If the computer with the missing password is a laptop, the instructions are similar, except you’ll definitely need an external hard drive enclosure to connect a laptop hard drive to a desktop computer (and vice-versa).
 With the computer turned off and unplugged, open the case and disconnect the hard drive., Alternatively you could open the second PC and install it., Because you’re logged in as an administrator and have the other hard drive connected to the computer, you now have access to everything on the other hard drive., Press ⊞ Win+E to open the File Explorer.

The second hard drive will show under “Computer” or “This PC,” depending on the version of Windows you are using. Double-click this drive and navigate to the user’s files, which are located in C:\Windows\Documents and Settings\User, where “User” is the name of your user.
Press ⊞ Win+E again to open a second instance of the File Explorer, which will make it simple to drag files from your user’s directory to the second computer. You can drag the files anywhere, including a flash drive.
 While you haven’t recovered the password, you’ve copied the user’s files so they haven’t lost any data.

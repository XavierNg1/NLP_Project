 The free version of FRAPS only creates screenshots in BMP format. This creates a perfect copy of the screen image, but results in a very large file size. You'll want to convert the files to a PNG or JPG if you plan on uploading or sharing them. While it's simple enough to do one or two conversions using Paint, if you have lots of screenshots you'll want a tool that will let you convert them all at once.
 IrfanView is a free image viewer that allows you to convert all of your screenshots at once in a batch. You can download it from irfanview.com.
 Click "File" and select "Batch Conversion/Rename". This will open a new window.
 Click the drop-down menu and select the format that you want to use. PNG and JPG are the most common formats for screenshots.
 Click the Options button to the right of the "Output format" menu to adjust your quality settings. Most users can leave these at their defaults, but you can increase or decrease the quality of the finished files. This will directly affect the size of the files.
 Use the frame on the right to navigate to your screenshots folder. Select the files that you want to convert, or click Add all to add every file in the folder., You can choose where you want the converted files to appear. Click Use current directory to put the converted files in the original screenshots' directory.
 Click Start Batch to begin converting the files. The time the conversion takes depends on the number of files you are converting and your quality settings.

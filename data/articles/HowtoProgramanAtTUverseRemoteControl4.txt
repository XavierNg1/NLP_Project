 Then, point the remote control at the device. If you cannot find your user manual, you can search your remote control's memory for the 4-digit code device code. This is also effective if the desired device isn't listed in the manual.
 At the same time, hold the OK key. All keys should flash twice.
 The selected mode key should flash two times.
 Wait for the device to turn off before you release PLAY. Use the REW key to look through each code backwards one at a time, and the FF key to look through them forwards one at a time. PLAY will resume an auto-search of the codes.
 The mode key will flash three times.


If you cannot find the desired code, press EXIT to return to normal use of the control.
Note that the Mode keys will flash red and the remote control will return to normal function if it cannot find a valid code.
 If it does not work, you may need to repeat the steps.

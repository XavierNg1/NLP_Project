 Clean teeth are instrumental for good contact between the whitening gel and the tooth surfaces.;
, (If you do not have a tray, order an impression set with your first supply of whitening gel.)

, Wipe off any excess gel that spills out of the tray's top.
 Most models come with a shield that you remove. Gently clean the mouthpiece.
 Insert the light source's mouthpiece between your lips. It will bump up against the tray, which is perfectly alright.
 Since most whitening sessions last about 20 minutes, you can do fun things like surfing the Internet or reading while waiting for the timer to alert you to the end of the whitening period.
 Remember to turn off the LED light!

, Use a soft cloth to clean the whitening tray and the LED light's mouthpiece. Store everything out of the reach of children. Your equipment is now ready for future use! If you notice that you are running low on whitening gel, contact Sporting Smiles for a refill.

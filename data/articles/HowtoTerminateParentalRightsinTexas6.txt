 Most states have adopted safe haven laws to prevent infant abandonment and infanticide by mothers in distress.The laws permit mothers to leave their newborn children at a designated place without facing prosecution for child abandonment. Babies surrendered at safe haven locations receive care from the state's child custody department until the department finds a permanent home for the child., You must surrender your child at the place and within the time specified. In Texas, you must take your child to a safe haven within 60 days of the child's birth. Safe haven locations include any emergency medical services provider, hospital, or licensed child welfare agency., You can choose to deliver a baby anonymously.Provide as much information as you can about the baby, including any particular medical needs and when the baby was last fed.


In Texas, unlike some other states, the child must be delivered to the safe haven location by a parent.Texas will not recognize the privileges of anonymity and immunity from prosecution if there is evidence that the baby has been abused or neglected.

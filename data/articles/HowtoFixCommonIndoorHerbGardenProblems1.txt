 One major problem with household herbs is a lack of light. If your herbs seem to be wilting, make sure they have enough access to quality natural or artificial light. This may correct the problem and lead to your herbs growing strong.Herbs require natural light to thrive and cannot grow adequately with regular household lights. For the best results, place your herbs near a window or allow them exposure to a natural light source.
If this is not an option, stop by a local greenhouse. You can pick up some LED grow lights that will allow your herbs to thrive. Regular lightbulbs will not help your herbs grow.;
, A common problem with indoor herb gardens is a lack of humidity. In general, the insides of homes and apartments are less humid than the outdoors. Heaters, air conditioners, and other appliances can dry out air, causing herbs to wilt.Mist your plants once a day with a spray bottle.
If the air in your home is very dry, invest in a humidifier. Keep that running in the room where you're growing your herbs.
 These places tend to be very dry. They can also cause sudden fluctuations in temperature, which is bad for herb plants. If your herbs are by a radiator, stove, or an air vent, move them elsewhere right away to prevent problems from occurring.Some herbs require specific temperatures during the germination period. Sage seeds, for example, will not grow if the temperature is not between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. When planting herbs, be particularly careful about avoiding temperature hazards., Natural light is always best for herbs. If you have access to a balcony, and the weather does not get too cold in your area, this is the best place to place your herbs.This works best if you have a balcony facing east or west.
Make sure your balcony is big enough to accommodate all your herbs. Overcrowding can slow the growth of your plants.
You can also look into planting in an exterior window box, if you have one.

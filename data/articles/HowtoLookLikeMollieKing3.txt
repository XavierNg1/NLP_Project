 If you're not then just keep your skin spot free and it will be as beautiful as Mollie's anyway.
, Use it on the cheekbones and a tiny bit on the outer corner of the eye.
, For this step it doesn't matter what you use as long as it is a good quality eye primer

, For the base colour just use a light peach colour. For the crease of the eyelid I recommend MAC wedge but you could use any eyes shadow close to this colour.
 Lining the eyes is the main part of this look. You can use any black waterproof eyeliner for this step. Don't do it to thick or it won't look right

, This step is optional but you can use a black eyeshadow and brush it over the eye liner. Little parts of the eyeshadow should come out of the line to create the effect.
 Use a black mascara for the top lashes and brown for the bottom to make your eyes appear wider. You can use a volumizing mascara if you want.
 Use Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Glow Sheer Powder but if you can find anything like it then use that. Add on a blusher of your choice.
 Fill the lip in with the lip liner MAC strip down or any lip liner with the same colour. Then use a pink/peach lipstick or lipgloss like Bobbi Brown pink sunset lipgloss.

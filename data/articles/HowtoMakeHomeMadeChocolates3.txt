 Here's what you'll need to make homemade chocolate bars:


1 cup cocoa butter
1 cup dutch process cocoa powder
1/2 cup honey, maple syrup or agave nectar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

, Place the cocoa butter and sweetener (be it honey, maple syrup or agave nectar) in a bowl. Microwave it on high until the cocoa butter is completely melted, then stir the ingredients together until smooth., Stir them into the mixture until the ingredients are completely blended and no lumps of cocoa powder remain.
 Use candy molds or create bars of chocolate by pouring the mixture into the bottom of a small baking pan, such as a bread loaf pan.
 Allow the chocolate to harden at room temperature, or place it in the refrigerator to speed things along. If you're making chocolate bars, score the chocolate to create bar shapes halfway through to make the bars easier to cut later.
 Pop the chocolate candies from the molds, or cut the chocolate into bars. Store chocolate you don't immediately eat in the refrigerator.

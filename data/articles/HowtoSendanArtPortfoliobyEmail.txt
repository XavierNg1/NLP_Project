 If possible send a personal note or a postcard with images to introduce yourself. Let them know you are interested in submitting your art for consideration and you want to do so properly.


You can check in art listings on-line or local guides to determine what type of art they specialize in. Can you see your work fitting in with the style of their gallery? Read what their policies are on submissions, contracts, fees, publicity, art openings/closing receptions, insurance and collecting taxes.;
, Include some full views and detail photos. Label each image you send with your name, title and media.
 They may also want a written artist statement, bio, exhibition experience. Clear contact information and plans for the exhibition are a must. Respect their guidelines carefully to make it easy on them.
 Most shows set their calendars months even years in advance. Be aware they be interested in you but for the following year.
 This will show that you have a following and possible clients.
 Art Gallery Commissions may be set at 30/70%, 40/60%, or 50/50 depending on where the gallery is located. Do not try to negotiate this, as the owner/ event coordinator is looking at his cost, and profit too. if you believe it is too high, you may have to adjust your prices or look else where. Art co-ops are another option to high end galleries, but you may need to work at the desk or hang shows.
 Pick art avenues that are not too far away, so that if needed you can deliver the work easily, and figure in the cost of going to a reception, gas and overnight stays.

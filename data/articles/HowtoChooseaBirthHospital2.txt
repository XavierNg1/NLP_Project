Some birth centers are free-standing facilities, while others are located within or adjacent to typical hospitals., If you want to have some choices considering whether to eat while in labor or what birth position to choose, a birthing center may be your better choice.Most birthing centers allow you to snack or have light meals while in labor, in contrast to hospitals that typically only offer ice chips during this time.

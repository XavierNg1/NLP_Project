 The process is GMAW (Gas Metal Arc Welding), commonly known as MIG welding (Metal Inert Gas welding). MIG welding was developed during World War II as a fast, portable process to create strong, durable joints. Today it is used in many shop and factory applications as well as by home hobbyists and welding enthusiasts.;
, MIG welding uses a machine to feed a wire through a contact tip into a MIG gun. The electrically charged contact tip transfers the welding current to the wire. The arc is established between the wire and the base metal. Often times an inert gas is used, which flows out of the gas nozzle to shield the welding process from the atmosphere. There are several modes of metal transfer:


Short circuit (thin metals)
Globular transfer (heavier metals)
Spray transfer (hottest)

, Once you learn how to use a MIG welder, you can make repairs around the home. A MIG welder can be used on stainless steel, mild steel, and aluminium of all thicknesses. Shielding gases will vary depending on base metal and welding wire.

 Some players are better at hit an run attacks (quick and cheap to make). Some players are better at large scale attacks (slow to make but powerful).


Have a goal before attacking: gold, elixir, and dark elixir.
Go for targets that have enough of the resource you want, and the resource that is easy enough for you to get.
Don't just go for the ones with a lot of loot available; it needs to be within your power to get them.
Accept failure. Learn from mistakes to improve your strategy (this will also help make you better for war).
 Notice where things went right or wrong. Watch other people's attacks; notice their army composition.

 This can be a difficult task even for those people close to you, so it is helpful to at least start the process off. You can create an outline stating the major points that you would like covered. Or, you can write out an entire draft and provide a list of the places that you would like it sent to., It is always a nice gesture to write a few, quick words (or even a more lengthy note) to those people closest to you. These letters can be designed to be opened right after your death, as opposed to the weeks it may take to process your will and related effects. Be honest and sincere in these letters and use them as an opportunity to say an extended good-bye.


It is a good idea to update these letters every so often. You can ask your lawyer to hold onto them for you or you can give this task to someone you trust.
 Go through all of your documents and notes and make copies. Give one copy to your attorney and a few others to family members who you trust. This will allow them to act on your preferences without delay. Many funeral homes will also file your plans away for you, usually free-of-charge.Avoid putting your only plan copy into a safe deposit box as it could be difficult for your family members to access it quickly. The same goes for a will, which can be read days after a funeral.The Funeral Consumers Alliance has a funeral planner available for purchase ($15) as well. You can use this binder to contain and carry all of your assorted paperwork too. Some companies also offer funeral planning via a website subscription, such as My Wonderful Life.

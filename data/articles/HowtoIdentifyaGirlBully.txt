 This is the most obvious type of bullying and the easiest to identify.






If she simply talks about possible violence, "Ooh If the girl ever talks to me again I will sock her in the face," but never follows through, then it is likely she is not a bully.


Does she act nice one minute and then act rude another? To a degree where you don't know if she is nice or mean? This is an indicator of bully behavior.
Does she say thinks like," I can beat up this..." OR " I am so bad..." then she is just trying to seem bad but don't test her to find out if all that isn't true.
Lastly, do you see her publicly insult, start degrading rumors about, or attempt to embarrass others? If so, then she is probably a bully.;
, If she won't let you, then talk to an adult.

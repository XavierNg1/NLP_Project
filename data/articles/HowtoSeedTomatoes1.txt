 On a cutting board, turn the tomato sideways, so that the top is facing to the right or left. Cut down the middle of the tomato towards the board. If you think of the tomato as the Earth with the North Pole being the top of the tomato, you'll be cutting through the Equator., Place the tomato cut-side up on the cutting board. You should be able to see that the tomato is basically divided into four even sections with seeds and gel in between each section. You're trying to keep the flesh that's dividing up the seeds., Find a small spoon, such as a 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon. It should be smaller than a regular spoon. Scoop out the seeds, being gentle with the flesh. If you want, you can place the seeds in a strainer over a bowl to drain out the juice for later use.The nice part about this method is you can now stuff the tomato halves with something, such as goat cheese.

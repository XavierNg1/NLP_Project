 You'll need a large foam or styrofoam ball to be your Sun. Get smaller items, like marbles or painted balls of paper or clay to be your planets. Paint them as necessary to make them look like the planets.
 Get some thick gauge wire or a wooden dowel and a styrofoam cone/half sphere/other good base. Stick the wire or dowel into the base, leaving enough of the wire exposed at the top to go at least halfway into your sun with an extra 1" remaining between the top of the base and the bottom of the sun. Then, glue the styrofoam to a wooden or other heavy flat surface that you can use as a base.
 Stick the Sun onto the dowel or wire, being careful to leave the extra 1" of space available below.
 Take some long wire that is thick enough to hold its shape but malleable enough that you can bend it with tools like pliers. Wrap one end of each of 8 wires around the extra space below the Sun, and bend up the ends in an L shape in order to give you a spot to place each one of your planets. Adjust the arm's length and height to keep the planets in their correct order and line.


The planets should be placed so that the furthest is on the lowest arm and the closest on the highest arm.
 Once all of the arms are attached, attach the planets to the arms using glue or tape. Enjoy your solar system model with fully orbiting planets!

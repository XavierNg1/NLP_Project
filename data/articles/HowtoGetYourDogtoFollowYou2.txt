 You can help teach your dog to follow you by teaching them to come when called. Start by placing the dog on a long rope or leash. This rope or leash should be long enough so that the dog can run around and play with some freedom.You may want to get a cheap rope or lead from a hardware or home improvement store since most leashes are too short.
 With your dog on the lead, use the "come" command. If they don't come towards you when you give the command, correct them softly. Pull the dog towards you gently by reeling the rope in slowly. Make sure to use the command of "come" again while pulling them towards you.
 Make your dog want to come to you when called by using positive reinforcement. When the dog obeys, present them with a treat, praise, or a toy.Avoid punishing the dog, yelling at them, or hitting them for not obeying. This will make your dog not want to come to you.
Give your dog lots and lots of praise! Praising them for following your instructions will help to motivate them to continue with training and make training a positive experience for them.
 At first, start this exercise with the dog close to you. You should be far enough away that the dog has to walk towards you, but not so far that they are on the other side of the yard. When the dog masters coming to you at this point, expand the distance between the two of you slowly.Continue expanding the distance between you and the dog until the dog gets to the length of the rope or lead.

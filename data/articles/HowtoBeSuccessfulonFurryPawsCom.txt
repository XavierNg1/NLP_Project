Try to befriend someone who has a lot of experience with Furry paws, they could give you a couple of pointers if they are up too it.
 Most of the teenagers and young adults, are "Elite."

, "How do you want to be successful?" What this means is there are about 3 ways to become successful on FP. First way, Train, breed or show dogs that could come in handy. 2nd way, is to get a sponsor (a sponsor is someone who helps you get elite, please learn about elite on another article because this is not what we're focused on.) And lastly, Art this is the absolute best way to be successful, if you have a laptop your art may be a little sloppy. There are a lot of art programs and photo uploaders and you may put the art up for sale and get real money sometimes.
 Keep building up and follow these steps!

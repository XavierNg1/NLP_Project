 You could heat it up to make it gooier on the inside if you'd like -- but just a quick blast in the oven or microwave is plenty.
 If you have a wedge, it's simple enough to plop it on a nice tray with some grapes and crackers (and a knife!) and call it a day. But if you have a wheel, you may want to make the first initial cut -- sometimes making the first cut into a beautiful wheel of cheese at a party is intimidating when you're only a guest!


Your guests may not know what to do with it either! Feel free to precut just a slice to make the whole process clear.
 Just like mentioned in the previous section, a number of delicious things go well with brie -- nothing super fancy or at all time consuming is necessary.


Don't wanna scroll up? That list was apples, pears, fig jam or tart cherry compote, honey, French bread, almonds or candied walnuts, or white crackers.

 Studying multiple languages can feel like a daunting task. To avoid burnout, include some fun language-learning activities into your study time. Watch movies or shows with subtitles in one of the languages you’re learning, listen to music in your new language, or find native speakers of the language that you can talk to and practice with.


Joining a local conversation group or language exchange for the languages you’re learning can be a great way to stay motivated and meet new people. You can use a website like meetup.com or your local newspaper to find a group like this. You can also join a virtual language exchange through a website like iTalki.
 Be sure to schedule time each day to practice at least one of your languages. In addition to the scheduled time, you can label items around your house in the different languages, or change the language settings on your phone and computer. Small changes like this will give you little bits of language practice even when you’re not formally studying.
 To stay motivated, it helps to have a solid reason for why you want to learn the new languages. Find something that you care about to help you get motivated to keep learning. Some ideas are to plan a trip to a country that speaks one of the languages you’re learning, or join a volunteer group for helping speakers of that language get accustomed to life in your country., Don’t forget to celebrate all of your small accomplishments! Allow yourself to take breaks as a reward, or treat yourself to a dessert that is traditional to a country that speaks a language you’re learning. Planning a trip to a country that speaks the language is also a perfect way to reward yourself.

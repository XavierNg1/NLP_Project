 To make palette bases for eyeshadows, you will need to roll out and cut out some black fondant into rectangles and








If you want to create some round eyeshadow pots, then use circle cookie cutters to create perfect circular pieces.
If you want to create rectangular pots, then cut out a couple of rectangles.
Use some of your actual eye shadow pots to help you determine what dimensions you will need.
 Next, you will need to create some fondant eyeshadow for the pots you created. Cut out some pieces that are slightly smaller than the pieces you created for the pots.








Make each piece about ½ inch (1 cm) smaller than the black pot fondant piece you created.
After you create the eyeshadow palette pieces, attach them pieces to the palette pieces with a drop or two of water and set them aside to dry.
If you like, you can shape, imprint, or indent the pieces as desired. For example, you could use the side of a ruler to makes small indents in a rectangular piece, or use a fondant imprint mat to press a design (like a heart or flower) into the fondant eyeshadow., If desired, you can also make an eyeshadow applicator by cutting out a small black fondant rectangle (about ½ inch by 3 inches) and a small white fondant cone for the tip. Flatten the cone and attach it to the end of the black rectangle with a drop of water.

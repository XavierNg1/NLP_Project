 This works well to remove stains caused by organic items, like coffee, food, leaves, and lichen. Mix a small amount of ammonia with water. Scrub with a sponge or soft cloth until the stain lifts, Then, dry the area with a clean towel.








Bleach can also be used, but it is not as good as ammonia because it is more acidic.
 Rust occurs when metal oxidizes during contact with stone. The rust stains can be lifted with lemon juice and salt. Pour some lemon juice and salt onto a clean cloth. Scrub with the cloth until the rust is gone. Immediately rinse the surface with water.








Lemon is acidic, so it should be removed as soon youâ€™re done using it. Rinse with a lot of water and dry with a towel.
 Paints and inks are more difficult to use because the cleaners for them are typically harsh. You can use mineral alcohol and a cloth to scrub off the stain. Methylene chloride can also be used, but it is dangerous.
 Fats from things like barbecues and candles can stain stone tile. Talcum powder can be used to remove the stains. Pour a fair amount of talcum powder on the stain and leave it for several days. Repeat the process again if the stain does not lift.

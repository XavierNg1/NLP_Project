 Make sure the napkin is free of wrinkles so the napkin roll will be smooth when finished. Iron the napkin if necessary to eliminate all wrinkles.;
, The cloth napkin will now be shaped like a triangle. Line the seams so they are even; smooth out creases in the fabric.
 Center it even so the middle of the knife is aligned with the top corner of the napkin. Leave a space between the edge of the napkin and the cutlery. Place a fork directly on top of the knife and then lay a spoon on the fork so the cutlery is stacked in a straight line.
 Hold the fabric in place with 1 hand so the edge will stay secure while you fold in the end pieces. With the other hand, fold the right side of the napkin all the way over the cutlery. Repeat this on the left corner of the napkin so that both corners overlap in the middle. Make sure the corners are snug where they crease against the covered cutlery. For reference, the napkin should now form the outline of a house.
 Keep the napkin snug so that the napkin roll does not fall apart easily.
 Place the finished napkin roll on your place setting with the exposed seam facing down. You may rest it on the right of the dinner plate or directly on top of the plate. For a buffet arrangement, have the wrapped silverware in a basket so guests can take one as they make their way through the buffet line.

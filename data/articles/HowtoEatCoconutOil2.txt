 This is a delicious treat that incorporates coconut oil. Break 2 ounces of dark chocolate into pieces, and melt it in the top of a double boiler.
Take the melted chocolate off of the heat and add 1 cup coconut oil, stirring until it melts.
Add a handful each of coconut flakes and slivered almonds. Mix thoroughly.
Line an 8 x 8 Pan with parchment paper and pour the chocolate-coconut mixture into pan. Sprinkle top with sea salt.
Freeze for at least 15 minutes, then cut into 12 squares. Wrap and store in the freezer.

Add 1/2 cup coconut oil and melt.
Add 1/2 cup honey and stir well.
Stir in 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 cup chia seeds, and 1 1/5 cups shredded coconut. Add vanilla and sweetener to taste, if desired.
Line a 9 x 13 inch baking dish with parchment paper. Pour mixture into prepared pan. Refrigerate for at least one hour or until hard. Cut into squares and serve.
 First, heat a mug so that it will melt the coconut oil. Pour boiling water into the mug and let sit for 20 seconds, then pour the water out. Add 1 tablespoon of coconut oil to the mug and wait until it melts. Stir in 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder, a pinch of sea salt, and sugar to taste. Pour boiling water into the mixture and stir. Add cream or milk to taste.

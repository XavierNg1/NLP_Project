 This may sound like a clich√© that is sometimes impossible to remember, but if you panic you are only worsening the situation.
 Also, keep in mind that your child may not really be lost. They may have simply slipped out of your grip and are following behind, or are stopping to look at something. If you have looked everywhere around you and absolutely cannot find them, continue to the next step.
 They will radio the security office to inform them that there is a lost child in the park.
 This will make it easier for them to locate your child. Tell them if there is a specific area that your child might be likely to go to, such as a favorite ride or activity, or a pre-arranged meeting location. Take a picture of your child before going to the park (dressed in the same clothes, etc.) on your cellphone, if possible. You can show or share this with security personnel.
 Panicking or disagreeing with the security may land you in more frustration than you are in already. They are experienced professionals trained to deal with this type of situation. In fact, they see similar situations hundreds of times a year.
 Your child may be nearby, just hidden in the crowd, and will most likely come back to you if they see where you are.
 Many amusement parks have stations like these where employees who find lost children take them. There are usually some activities there to keep your child occupied until they can be reunited with you/their group. In most cases, your lost child or group member will be found by now if you have given the security a good description of them. If hours pass and your child is still not found, they will contact the local authorities.

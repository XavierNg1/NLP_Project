 Dance aerobics can vary from low impact to high impact depending on what you feel comfortable doing. For these reasons, you should wear a good pair of sneakers and some clothing that will move with your body. Wearing a sports bra is also a good idea.Try stretchy materials, such as lycra and spandex. Or go with some loose fitting sweatpants and a t-shirt.
 You can do dance aerobics in a small to medium sized space, such as your living room or bedroom. However, you will need to make sure that you have an open, clear space to move around. If there are any tables or chairs that might get in your way, move them to the sides of the room before you start your workout.
 It is important to stay hydrated while you exercise, so keep a glass or a bottle of water nearby. Drink some water before you get started, during your workout, and after you finish your workout as well.


You will need to drink between 1.5 to 2.5 cups of water to replace the fluids you lose from sweating. If you work out at a high intensity or for more than an hour, then you may need to drink even more water., Exercising is good for you, but it can cause pain if you overexert yourself. Make sure that you do not push yourself too hard and that you stop if you start to feel any discomfort.


For example, if you feel short of breath, have pain in any part of your body, or feel exhausted, then stop the workout right away.

Courage has an egg shaped body, so begin by drawing and egg in the middle of your paper.;
, Once you have the egg sketched, on top of the egg (this will cover some of the eggs head), you will sketch a hat with a flat end.


Once the hat is drawn erase the egg lines that are inside of the egg.



Draw the nose in a triangular shape.



When drawing paws think of them as a three leaf clover.



When drawing the eyes, think of them as ovals.
The ears almost resemble hot dogs on a stick, just bent.



Add any final details around Courage's neck and snout.
When details are done, erase any extra pencil lines.

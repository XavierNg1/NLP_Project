 These cosmetics items can be used to help create an appearance of paler skin. However, the effect may look artificial if you try to use a shade that's much lighter than your skin. Instead, choose the shade that best matches your skin tone â€“ perhaps even one that is slightly lighter, since you're trying to get paler skin. Use foundation or concealer to cover minor blemishes. This will create a blank canvas on which to apply the rest of your makeup.


Try a BB cream to help even out your complexion and cover blemishes or splotchy patches.
 Dark colors on your nails, lips, and eyes will contrast against your skin and make your skin appear paler. Try black, maroon, deep purples, reds, blues, indigo, or cobalt.
 Like dark makeup and other accents, having darker hair can create a contrast with the skin on your face and neck. This can bring out some natural paleness, but it is no permanent solution. There are many henna-based hair dyes available as well, in case you have sensitive skin or want to avoid some of the harsher chemicals present in other dyes.
 Pale people who wear pastel or light clothing can look washed out. Darker clothes might create a slight contrast, making your skin look paler by comparison. Keep in mind that this effect will only be noticeable if your skin is already fairly pale.

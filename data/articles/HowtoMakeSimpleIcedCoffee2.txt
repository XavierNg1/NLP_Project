 If you have not already, get out your coffee maker, and brew a cup of coffee. Try to make it on the stronger side, as the ice will water it down later on.


Consider adding the sugar now. Sugar dissolves better in hot drinks than it does in cold drinks.
 If you just add ice to it, it will not be cold enough. You'll need to let the coffee cool down a little. Room temperature will be enough. If you'd like your iced coffee even colder, wait 15 to 20 minutes, then place it into the fridge for a little bit.


Don't stick your hot coffee straight into the fridge. You'll risk the cup breaking. The hot steam will also raise the temperature of your fridge.
 You can use regular ice cubes, or ice cubes made from frozen coffee. Avoid filling the glass all the way with ice, or you may not have enough room for the coffee. You can always add more ice later, if it is not enough for you.
 If you need to add more ice, do so now.
 If you have not already, add the sugar to your drink now. Start with a splash of cream and a spoonful of sugar, stir, and taste. Add more cream and/or sugar until you get your coffee to where you like it.
 The longer you let it sit, the more watery it will become.

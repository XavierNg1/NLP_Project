 If your soil pH tested below 7, add dolomite or quick lime to the soil. Wood ash in moderation helps as well. Both are available at local gardening centers.
 If your soil pH tested above 7, add organic matter such as pine needles, peat moss, decomposed tree leaves. Sulfur is very effective as well.
 For example, add sulfur to a certain area of your garden to encourage beautiful blue blooms on your hydrangeas, which prefer more acidic soils. The pH of your soil does not need to be uniform your entire garden over; feel free to alter it to support different plants.

 Pour a small amount of chlorine bleach onto a clean rag and dab it into the linoleum in an inconspicuous area. Bleach has a lightening effect if not used on an already light surface, so if the linoleum looks discolored or markedly lighter, do not use bleach to clean the stain.Bleach should only be used as a last resort. Some advise never to use bleach on linoleum, while others report success in removing hair dye stains. This is why spot testing bleach is essential; if it discolors the surface of the linoleum, it should not be used since it can cause even more damage.
Wear gloves when using bleach.
 If the bleach is safe to use on your linoleum surface, apply the bleach to a cotton ball, then rub at the dye stain, taking care to not rub outside the stained area.As you are cleaning, you may find it helpful to rub the area clean with water to get a better idea of your progress before blotting again with bleach.
 Once you have finished removing the stain, damped a clean rag with water and rub the area you were cleaning to get rid of any excess bleach or other cleaners.

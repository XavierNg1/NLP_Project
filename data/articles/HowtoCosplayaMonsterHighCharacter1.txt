 Draculaura is the 1600 year old daughter of Dracula. She has a sweet, bubbly personality and tends to develop crushes very easily. You can be like her by being nice to everyone, including your enemies. Say hello when you pass them in the hallway, smile and compliment someone, etc.;
, Draculaura's style is inspired by the Japanese Gothic/harajuku style. She wears a lot of pink and black. You can wear a black skirt with pink tights and a cool pink and black graphic t-shirt. Mix and match what you have in your wardrobe to create something truly Draculaura (she uses the clothing her father bought and accessorizes to make it more, well, up to date.) If you're attending a formal event or dress party, wear her Sweet 1600 look, wear a sparkly little black dress, accessorize with a satin pink belt, and wear gold jewelry.
 Draculaura has black hair with pink streaks. You don't have to dye your hair pink and black, but you can buy some clip on highlights; they're really cheap and look very realistic. Put your hair up into pigtails.
 Draculaura has flawless beautiful skin. Put on some good quality foundation and some powder for a perfect base. Then, use some dark pink eyeshadow on the bottom part of your eyelids, then some light pink eyeshadow on the rest of your eyelids. Top off with some blush and pink lipstick & lip gloss.

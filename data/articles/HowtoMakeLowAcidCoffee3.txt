 Add 10 tablespoons (54 g) of medium-ground coffee, 10 cups (2.4 l) of cold water, and 5 empty egg shells that have been crushed to a large sauce pan. Turn the burner to medium-high to bring the mixture to a boil.Make sure to use a nonreactive pan for boiling the coffee.
The pan should be partially covered while you’re waiting for it to come to a boil.
 Once the coffee mixture has come to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover the pan completely, and allow it to simmer for 5 to 7 minutes.If the mixture isn’t simmering, you may need to raise the heat to medium.
 When the coffee mixture has simmered for several minutes, remove the pan from the burner. Let the mixture stand until the coffee grounds settle, which should take approximately 2 minutes., After the coffee grounds have settled, use a fine mesh sieve to strain the coffee ground and egg shells from the mixture. Transfer the coffee to a pot, and serve.

 Follow the seed packet directions if planting seeds; you will need to sow indoors 8 to 10 weeks earlier in order to get the spring flowering.;
, Lobelia can be grown in a container or in the garden. Use either very good quality potting soil or good quality soil with compost added for garden planting.
 If planting in containers or window boxes, you'll have the freedom to move these around if needed.
 Plant the seedlings in sunny well drained spots after the last frosts have gone or in a frost-free environment. Space plants 10 - 12 cm (4-5 in.) apart. In a container, Lobelia can be grown more closely together.
 A liquid feed is the best option for fertilizing lobelia.
 This will tidy up the plant and encourage new blooms.

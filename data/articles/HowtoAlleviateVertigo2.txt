 Start by turning your head 45 degrees to the left, and then to the right.
 Next, quickly lean your head back onto a pillow, keeping your neck and shoulders relaxed. Tilt your head so that the ear affected with vertigo is lower, resting on the pillow. Hold this for 30 seconds.
 Keep your head on the pillow, and slowly turn it so that your opposite ear is resting on the pillow. Hold your head in this position for an additional 30 seconds.
 Stabilize your head so that it doesnâ€™t move, and then move your body 90 degrees further in the same direction. Hold your entire body in this position for 30 seconds.
 In order to rid yourself of vertigo completely, repeat all of these movements (in order) three times daily. These are similar to those performed by a physical therapist, but for much less hassle and money.

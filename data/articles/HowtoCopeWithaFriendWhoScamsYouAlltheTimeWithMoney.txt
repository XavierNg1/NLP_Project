 Tally up what is owed, with dates if possible. Present these facts to your friend, pointing out how much this has cost you so far and over what period of time. Tell your friend that you need to get the money back now as you owe money for X bill or a payment on something etc. Provide facts and back up with your pressing need.;
, When you go out with your constantly begging friend, start refusing to pay the entry fee, for drinks, for a cinema ticket, for the meal. Warn your friend in advance that you are only paying for yourself. You can ease it by saying you can't afford it this time (likely this is true anyway) and that you only have enough money for yourself.
 You might feel like a Grinch and a little mean but you're going to be even grouchier if this money scamming keeps going on and you end up paying for everything. Look it as a favour to your friend; until your friend learns to stand on their own two feet and pay their own way, they are not going to learn the true value of things and what the real cost is in having money (e.g., hours at work, commitment to saving etc.). Tell your friend is becoming a real strain on your own finances and that their constant need for you to give them money or cover their expenses is making you feel obliged rather than part of an unconditional friendship.
 If your friend lacks understanding and gets angry or whines about your requests, and doesn't stop pestering you, it might be time to reconsider your friendship. A friend who always needs money will always be a friend; is this friend truly one or not is the question you should be asking yourself and putting to the test.

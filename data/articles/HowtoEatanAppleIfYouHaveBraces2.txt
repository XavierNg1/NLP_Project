If you have a juice extractor, all you need to do is cut up your apples and feed them into the machine. Be careful not to put your fingers or any foreign objects into the juicer.
You can also experiment with adding other fruits and vegetables, like cucumbers, kale, carrots, pineapple, or oranges, to your apple juice. You can invent your own recipes or search online for suggestions.
If you don't have a juicer, you can also make homemade apple juice or cider by cooking diced up apples in water on your stove top, mashing the apples with a potato masher, and then straining the liquid. Search online for a recipe so you will be sure to get the proportions right.

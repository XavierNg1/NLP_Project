 You know the people in your life who will provide you with encouragement as you lose weight. Avoid telling people in your family or social circle about your weight loss journey if you know that they will try to sabotage your goals.
 Online, you can meet people all over the world who are on a similar journey to your own. You can share tips about what works and what doesn’t. When you’re tempted to veer from the diet, you can go to the community to find support.
 Sometimes, losing weight with a friend makes meeting goals easier. Check in with your friend daily via email or telephone.
 Sometimes, people enjoy the accountability of broadcasting their weight loss efforts to their social media circle. Find a mobile app that will post to Facebook when you record exercise, or tweet your weekly weight loss or gain.
 When you are going to a party, for instance, eat a nutritious Atkins meal before you leave. That way, you won’t feel as tempted by the hors de oeuvres that are on display at the party. Also, plan to limit your alcohol intake. Alcohol not only adds carbs but also affects your judgment.

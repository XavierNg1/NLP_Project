 Remove anything that may be in the drawers of the cabinet. Clean the cabinet well with a damp cloth. Allow the cabinet time to dry. Use fine sandpaper and go over the cabinet to remove any loose paint or rust. Sanding will help the new paint to stick better.;
, You may choose to use a special spray paint that is made just for painting on metal. Purchase a primer for metals that prevents rust. Purchase the kind of paint and the new color you would like for your cabinet. Read the label on the paint can to determine how much spray paint you need to buy.
 Paint the drawers separately from the cabinet. You may choose to only paint the front of the drawers. Decide if you want to paint the handles. If not, you will need to either remove them or cover them with painter's tape.
 Put something under the cabinet to protect the ground, such as newspaper or a drop cloth. Be aware of anything that is outside that might get stuck in the paint.
 Shake the paint can several times as you are applying the paint.
 Apply 1 coat of primer. Allow the primer to dry completely before applying the top coat of paint.
 Spray the cabinet holding the can several inches (cm) away from the cabinet. Use a steady back and forth motion with the can. Spray light coats of paint. If you get the paint too thick, it will run down the side of the cabinet.
 When the paint is completely dry, return the cabinet drawers.

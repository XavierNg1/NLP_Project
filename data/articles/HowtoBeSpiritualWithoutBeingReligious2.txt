Some of the most impressive people have felt spiritually empty. This is natural. One must doubt life's inherent meaning, in order to hope that life has significance., You probably know one or two people in your life who you think have found inner peace. You should engage them in conversation. Ask them for advice. Sure, they may not have the perfect answer to your problems, but they might have struggled with the same questions that disturb you.


You could ask: "How did you find meaning in your day to day life?"

, When you were a child, you probably did not struggle with connecting with the universe. You were a different person then. You should meditate on that time in your life. You can also focus on more recent experiences of serenity. Try to understand how you managed to enter those spaces of tranquility.


We are each made up of past selves.They still live within our memories. These previous versions of ourselves can teach us lessons if we let them.

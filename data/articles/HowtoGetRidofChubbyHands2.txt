 Longer nails and nail beds can give the illusion of longer, thinner fingers. Nail shape also plays a role. Filing your nails to a round or “squoval” shape is best for short, wide fingers., A pinching, too-small ring can make even thin hands look chubby! Accurately determine your ring size. Don’t just guess! The same thing goes for bracelets and watches.
 Thin bracelets and rings can make your hands look chubbier than they actually are. Conversely, thick bracelets and rings draw the eye away from chubby areas. They can also create the illusion of a more slender silhouette. However, minimal hand jewelry is also advised if you’re self-conscious about your hands. Consider wearing your flashiest accessories elsewhere to accentuate the attributes you’re proud of.
 If you’re extremely self-conscious about your hands, gloves may give you a confidence boost. Short nylon gloves with frilled edges work with many casual outfits. For dressier occasions, formal gloves are popular. Formal gloves can be a variety of lengths from short to very long, reaching past your elbow. Pick the type that is most flattering for you. When the weather gets chilly, wear insulated gloves.

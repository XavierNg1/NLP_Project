 Cleaning is hard physical work that requires consistency and much effort. If you get sick a lot, then cleaning would not be a good choice. On the other hand, if you see it as a paid workout, then good for you!


Mentally, it can be much easier cleaning other people's houses than cleaning your own, and it is also better than sitting bored at a desk pushing paper all day long or being yelled at by unsympathetic bosses.;
, This is one business where it can be easy to slip in because there are often more clients than good cleaners. If it is saturated where you are already situated, look further afield. Once you have established your reputation, you can move to your own residential area if wished.
 The beauty of beginning a cleaning business is its low start-up costs. You need cleaning products and equipment unless you are using the client's own gear and products (decide that in advance). You will also need transportation that is reliable, and some suitable clothes. Try to wear clothes that inspire confidence in the client, not dirty ragged things. You can always change or wear aprons, etc., for dirtier jobs.
 You will need to show these to worried clients, and you will need to meet all small business requirements in your region.
 What can you do that will set you apart? Eco-cleaning? Oven cleaning? Special pet dander removal? Allergen cleaning?


Many cleaning businesses offer various services such as carpet cleaning, general cleaning, window cleaning, hard floor maintenance, cleaning, special events, related insurance and more. A cleaning company offering the flexibility of control in decisions, gives more stability and consistency for your business.

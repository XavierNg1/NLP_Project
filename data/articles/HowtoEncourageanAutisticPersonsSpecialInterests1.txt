 They can read about their favorite things at their own leisure, without the expense of constantly buying new books.;
, This will ensure that they like whatever you give them, and they will feel understood and appreciated. Here are some examples of good gifts:


Arts and craft kits (e.g. bead bracelets with cat-shaped beads)
Home and kitchen ware that matches the interest (cat-shaped oven mitts in their favorite color)
Books (a book detailing types of cats)
Outfits (a shirt with a cute cat picture on it)
Toys (a stuffed cat)

, This is particularly easy if you're a parent or guardian. Whenever your child needs something new, see if any have designs related to the special interest. For example, your son could have shirts with pictures of cars, toothpaste with cartoon cars on the tube, car-themed bedsheets, et cetera. Treat it the same way you treat favorite colors or favorite cartoon characters.
 Sharing an interest is not only a good way for you to bond with the autistic person, but for others to bond for them too. For example, if your daughter loves chemistry, you can buy...


Age-appropriate chemistry sets to play with her siblings together
Science books that she can read to her little brother, or that her older sister can read to her
Board games with a science theme
Toys that combine science and one of her siblings' interests (e.g. a dinosaur science kit with her T. Rex-loving brother)

, For instance, when sending birthday invitations, mention the child/teen's special interests, so the attendees can pick out appropriate gifts. Relatives will also appreciate this knowledge, in case they want to bring presents or talk one-on-one with the autistic person.

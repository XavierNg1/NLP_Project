 Early Nokia phones (units, like the N8, that was released before Nokia adapted the Windows platform) use the Symbian operating system. Just like any other phones, all the data saved on a Nokia Symbian phone gets deleted when restored to its original settings, so make sure to create a backup of its contents (preferably on your computer).;
, Access your phoneâ€™s keypad (either physical or on-screen) and type in *#7370#. This is a special code that triggers the restoration process in Symbian phones.
 Your phone will reboot, and when it starts up, it will begin restoring itself to factory settings.
 Once the process is complete, your Nokia phone will restart and you can now use it again normally.


Now you can re-install any applications that were deleted when you restored your Nokia phone.

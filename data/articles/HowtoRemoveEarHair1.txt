 Before trimming your ear hair, make sure to clean wax or other debris out of your ears. Mix a salt water solution using a ratio of one teaspoon of salt per ½ cup (4 oz.) of water. Dip a clean Q-tip into the salt water and gently clean the immediate ear area (exterior to the ear canal) and the crevices at the top of the outer ear., To avoid cheap, ineffective trimmers as well as needlessly overpriced ones, opt for a mid-range model of ear hair trimmer (approximately $30-$50) . Look for a model with a rotary blade system and skin guard, which will prevent the blades from cutting your ears while you trim. If you are a frequent traveller, opt for a more lightweight trimmer that comes with a handy travel case.Most models of ear hair trimmers are battery-operated, so consider investing in rechargeable alkaline batteries and a charger.
 Choose a room with bright lighting (e.g. the bathroom) to trim your ear hair in. If possible, use a magnified mirror to see the ear hair that you want to trim as clearly as possible. While your fine ear hair might be invisible to you from some angles, it may be visible to people around you!, Make sure your ear hair trimmer fits comfortably into your ear canal and make sure that you don’t have to apply any force to insert it. Turn the trimmer on and gently move it over your ear hair to remove it. Stop and check your progress every minute or two to decide if you like the results.

 This is simply a bar or rod with a rope tied around its midpoint. The other end of the rope is attached to a weight. This simple piece of equipment is one of the most effective ways to build forearm muscle and train grip strength.;
, Most people cannot lift nearly as much with their wrist as they can with their full arm. Find the weight where a set is challenging, but not painful or extremely difficult., Grip the rod in both hands and hold it in front of you at around waist level. Since this position is not difficult to maintain, your wrists will be the limiting factor of the exercise. This lets you repeat the wrist roller exercise as long as your wrists are holding up.You can extend your arms straight in front of you instead to work your lower arms and shoulders as well, but this will likely limit the number of repetitions you can perform.
 Maintain your grip with one hand and turn the rod with the other to wind the rope around the rod. Alternate the turning and gripping hands until the rope is fully wound and the weight reaches the rod.


Try to keep the rod in position as you rotate it, without much tilting back and forth., Rotate the rod the other way until the rope is fully extended. Do this slowly and evenly. If the rod keeps slipping out of your grip, wrap a grip around the rod to reduce friction, or just focus on the upward motion.


Try 3 sets of 10 reps.

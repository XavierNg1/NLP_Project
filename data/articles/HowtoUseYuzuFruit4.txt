 Use a citrus zester or grater to finely grate the rind of a fresh yuzu fruit. Measure out a quarter ounce of zest and place it in a mortar.When making essential oils, use a ratio of a quarter ounce (7 g) of zest to one cup (240 mL) of carrier oil. Your carrier oil should be a neutral oil, like jojoba or grapeseed. Avoid olive oil, which is too viscous and fragrant.
 Pour in just enough oil to cover the grated zest. Use a pestle to grind the zest and oil together and release the zest’s essence. Continue to macerate the zest for at least 15 minutes, then add the rest of the oil to the mortar., After adding the rest of the oil, cover the mortar tightly and let it stand out of direct sunlight for at least two days.If you’re making multiple batches, transfer the macerated zest and oil to a lidded jar or container so you can reuse the mortar for the next batch.
 Use a string or rubber band to secure cheesecloth to the top of a jar. Make sure it has some slack so it can catch the zest when you sift the oil. After at least two days, uncover the oil and pour it slowly through the cheesecloth into the jar.Let as much oil drain through the cloth as possible, then unfasten it from the top of the jar, but keep the zest in the cloth.. Squeeze the cloth over the jar to extract as much oil as possible from the zest.
 If you plan on using the oil within a month, just keep it tightly sealed when you’re not using it. Use yuzu essential oil for personal fragrance, add a few drops to a bath, or use it in a fragrance diffuser.You can also freeze extra batches of your yuzu essential oil for up to six months.

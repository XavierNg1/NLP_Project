 Have fun! It helps a lot when you get to the sleepover.
 Most likely, you will be tired anyway, and won't have the energy to think! Also, try not to think about home much during the sleepover, and if you find yourself really missing home, you could always just call home and ask to come home. You may not be quite ready for a sleepover yet.
 Every house runs a little differently and your friends routine may be different. This can be chores before bedtime, helping with siblings in the morning before school or going to church or other function. Ask about their schedule before so you can pack for it.
 Try to forget that they aren't there. Imagine they are in the next room, and they move out of the room when you go in there.

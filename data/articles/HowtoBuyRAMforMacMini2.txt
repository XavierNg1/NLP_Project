 The 2010 Mac Mini supports a total of 8 GB in memory, or RAM; whereas the 2009 Mac Mini models can only support a total of 4 GB in RAM.


Only 2 memory slots are built into these Mac Minis; therefore, you can purchase 2 separate memory modules that do not exceed the maximum capacity of supported GB for each model.
 You must purchase RAM with specific features that are compatible with the 2010 and 2009 Mac Minis.


Buy memory modules with features that are unbuffered, non-parity, 1066 MHz, PC3-8500 DDR3, and have 204-pin modules.

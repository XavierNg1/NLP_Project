, Navy Basic Underwater Demolition and SEAL (BUD/S) candidates who have successfully completed “Hell Week,” in which they are awake for virtually five days, say that it is difficult to fall asleep when you are moving around. The candidates are constantly moving, exercising, and being yelled at by their SEAL instructors.You can use some of these techniques to help your friend stay awake:


Create an exercise circuit to keep moving. Try doing 10 pushups, 10 sit ups, 10 squats for as many rounds as you can.
Throw a football or play a game of soccer. Near the end of Hell Week, SEAL instructors have the candidates engage in fun sports to stay awake.
 Try telling stories. Speak in a loud voice.


Tell your funniest story.
Tell a scary story.
 If you are studying late into the night, stand up to take your notes.
 Have her move around or stand up immediately.
 This is common in BUD/S training. The candidates are constantly being yelled at by their instructors.

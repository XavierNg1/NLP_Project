 If freezing lots, use more trays.
 Sprinkle to about 1/4 of the way in each ice cube hole in the tray.


This can work for mixed herb combinations as well as single herb varieties.
 Don't overfill the cubes or herbs will float away.


Note: Some people find it easier to pour in a little water, then add the herbs, then pour in the remaining bit of water. Experiment to see what you prefer.
 Once frozen, transfer to resealable freezer bags or freezer containers and label and date as appropriate.
 Leave until needed.
 To use, simply add one or two cubes to a dish you're cooking at any one time.


To help you measure, one ice cube of herbs is worth approximately 15ml/1 tablespoon of chopped herbs.

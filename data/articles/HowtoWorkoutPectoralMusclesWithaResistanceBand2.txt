 Before you do pectoral fly exercises, you will need to find a workout area that has a tall and narrow object, like a pole or a pipe, that you can loop the resistance band around so it stays in place. The idea is to have the resistance band at chest level so you can work your pectoral muscles properly.


Make sure the object you choose is a stable and attached to the ground and/or the ceiling. You will be using it to help create resistance for your body to work against so you want to make sure it will not shift or move as you do the exercises.
 This is a good introductory exercise that will strengthen your pectoral muscles in two simple movements. This exercise is a good alternative to the pectoral resistance machines found at the gym.









Start by looping the resistance band so it is around one side of the stable object. Hold each end of the resistance band in each hand so it is spread out to the distance of your arms. Make sure your arms are straight but your elbows are not locked. Your arms should be just below shoulder height.
Breathe in as you bring both arms forward so your hands meet in front of your chest. Try to keep a small bend in your elbows and your arms straight.
Breathe out as you return to the starting position with your arms straight on both sides.
Repeat these motions, breathing in and out, doing two to three sets of 10 to 15 reps.
 This is a variation on the standing pectoral fly where your arms stretch out and in at a 45 degree angle, instead of a 90 degree angle. You may need to find a stable object that will hold the resistance band at a lower angle, such as the bars in a stairwell or a doorknob that is secured well to a door.








Loop the resistance band so it is around one side of the stable object at a 45 degree angle. Hold each end of the resistance band so it spreads out to the distance of your arms. Your arms should form a 45 degree angle and sit at just below your shoulder height.
Breathe in as you bring both arms forward, towards your head, so your hands meet in front of your chest at a 45 degree angle.
Breathe out as you return to the starting position with your arms straight on both sides.
Repeat these motions, breathing in and out, doing two to three sets of 10 to 15 reps.
 In this variation, you will moving your arms towards the ground, rather than towards your head. It may be easier to do this exercise if you kneel on the ground. You can use the same object you used for the incline pectoral fly. Make sure you loop the resistance band around the stable object well so it stays in place as you do this exercise.








Kneel down so you are on your knees facing away from the object and loop the resistance band so it is around one side of the stable object at a 45 degree angle. Hold each end of the resistance band so it spreads out to the distance of your arms. Your arms should form a 45 degree angle and sit at just below your shoulder height.
Breathe in as you bring both arms forward, towards the ground, so your hands meet in front of your chest at a 45 degree angle.
Breathe out as you return to the starting position with your arms straight on both sides.
Repeat these motions, breathing in and out, doing two to three sets of 10 to 15 reps.

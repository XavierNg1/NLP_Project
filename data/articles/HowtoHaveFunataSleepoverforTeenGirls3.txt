 Leave some time in your sleepover plan for suggestions from your friends. Write up a list of things that everyone suggests and then pick one or two places to go.


Make sure your parents are okay with this plan. They might want a more settled plan for the night and might not want to add something new after everyone arrives.
 You don’t have to go anywhere special during your sleepover. Just going outside – to the backyard or maybe a nearby park – can make your sleepover more fun and special.


If you think you might go outside, make sure you tell your friends to bring appropriate clothes and shoes with them.
If it's warm outside, you can all bring towels outside and lay in the sun - just make sure you wear sunscreen first!
If it's cold and snowy, bundle up and have a snowball fight or build snowmen!
You can also use the outdoors as a backdrop for a fun photoshoot with your friends.
 You can have a camp out right in your backyard during your sleepover. Get a tent and ask your friends to bring sleeping bags. You can start a camp-fire if you have a fire pit, and use it to roast hot dogs or make s'mores.If you're having a sleepover in the winter, or if the weather isn't nice, you can still have a camp-out. Put your tent in the living room and make smores in the microwave.

 Dogs of all ages do not really need to be bathed unless they have a skin condition or if they are very dirty. If your puppy is very dirty or smelly you can bathe it occasionally.


Try not to bathe a puppy more than once a month or so.
Most dogs only need to be bathed a couple times a year.,


Do not put puppies into a bathtub, sink, or tub full of water. It is hard for them to regulate their body temperature and they can become too cold when immersed in water.
 Brush your puppy to remove tangles or mats before you bathe it if it has a long or fluffy coat.


It is good to get longer coated and fluffy dogs used to being brushed while they are young.
 Choose a soft clean cloth and get it wet in water that is warm but not very hot. Wipe the puppy off with the cloth.


Start at the head and wipe gently back towards the tail.
Make sure to wipe the underside too.
 Use shampoo made for puppies or babies. Puppy skin can be sensitive even as they start to grow.


Just use a small amount of shampoo.
Dry shampoos can be used on older puppies that don't like water. These are rubbed onto the coat without water.Make sure not to get the suds in the puppy's eyes.
 Lather the shampoo like you would on your own hair. Wipe the suds away with the cloth, then rinse it in warm water and wipe again. Repeat until the puppy is clean.
 Dry the puppy right away with a clean dry towel. It is important to get the puppy dry so it does not get too cold.
 Puppies need a place to stay warm since it is hard for them to regulate their own temperature.Choose an area that is not drafty.
 Get your puppy used to bathing and make them associate a bath with nice things like toys and treats. Let your puppy have a nice treat after its bath.

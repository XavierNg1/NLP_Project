 Sarepia forest is a great place to go, Mt. Shiveer is also a great place to go camping because they both have fire pits.;
, Gather all the things needed, like a weapon, blanket, and Boots. The Hot Cocoa Hut at Mt. Shiveer has some good items that can help, like snow trail shoes and parkas. You will not need this if you are camping at Sarepia Forest.
 Watch out for others on your trail, and bring everything you need with you.
 Set up your shelter, your bed and gather food. Maybe go fishing in Crystal sands if it is not too far away, It's up to you.
 So nightfall has settled down and the moon is up, and you're tired from your long adventure today. Get into your bed and get warm in your sleeping bag or blanket. Put your blanket or sleeping bag on and snuggle down (Preferably not with your hot chocolate with marshmallows so you don't spill it on you) and doze off into a lovely nature slumber.
 You've stayed the night and might have enjoyed it. Gather all your things and pack up. Take down your shelter, don't leave it for someone else because that will be a waste of gems and diamonds. Go back along the footsteps that you've taken wandering to your camping ground!

 When referring to it, use the table number: “table 1.”


Double-space all text corresponding to the table, including the reference information and the caption.
Align the table to the left.
 The table number goes above the table. The caption goes below the table number.
 If you are pulling the table from another source, place the source information below the table. Use a full reference citation under the table.


Use the author’s name (inverted, followed by a period), the title in italics (period), the location (colon), the publisher (comma), the year (period), and the medium (period).”
For example: “Red, Jay. Art for Art’s Sake. Alabama, Georgia: Art Publishers, 2004. Print.”
Use hanging indention (indent the lines after the first line). You don’t need to repeat this information on the reference page.



Label it underneath, with capitalization: “Figure 1” or “Fig. 1.” Right after that (on the same line), write a caption or title to describe it. Follow it with source information if it came from another source.
Align them the best way for the text. Some illustrations may fit better with text to the left or right, and MLA permits that usage.

 Baseball futures are wagers that are available for the entirety of the season. You may place your wager during the offseason, regular season, pennant races, and the post season. The odds will be updated and posted each week.Baseball future bets include who will win the world series, who will win the pennant, who will win the Cy Young award, etc. Keep in mind that the odds change each day as the season progresses. Future bets are challenging because performance, injuries, and personnel moves can all dramatically change your odds of winning and where the sportsbooks set the betting lines.
 Not all sportsbooks offer prop bets. Prop bets arenâ€™t usually related to the score of the game but rather the stats of individual players. For example, a prop bet could be which player will have the most RBIs, runs, and home runs in the game?You will see the players name and the payout of the bet. For example, Ken Griffey Jr. (SEA) -110
Prop bets are fun because you may bet on your favourite players. That can also be very profitable if you catch a player on a streak.
 A baseball parlay means that you combine two or more bets to create a greater payoff. All of the parts of your wager must win for you to win your parlay. This is especially useful if you put little down. There are many MLB games in a day so each parlay can increase your payout.For example, you may bet the moneyline of one game and parlay the total of another game to increase the payout odds of that single bet.

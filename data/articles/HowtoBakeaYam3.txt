 Since the peeling will be left on the yams, make sure to wash them thoroughly. Cut the yams into thin slices.


For potato wedges instead of fries, cut into eighths. The yams will be in long wedge shapes.
 Place fries into a large bowl or a plastic bag. Toss the fries with salt, pepper, and olive oil.

Try garlic, paprika, cumin, chili powder, curry, or seasoning salt in any combination.To make the fries as a paleo or clean eating dish, use coconut oil instead., Spread the fries on a baking sheet. Bake them for 20-30 minutes, turning them over at least once while baking. Depending on the oven, it may take more or less time.

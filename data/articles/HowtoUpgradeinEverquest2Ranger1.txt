 This means that if, for example, you find a rare towards the end of a tier, and you should avoid upgrading a skill that you got at the beginning of the tier, as it will be replaced quite soon.
 If you solo and/or kite a lot, then upgrading certain ranged attacks first will be the best choice (see section 4.2.2. for advice on the best attacks to use in kiting) If, however, you prefer to play in groups, you’ll want to upgrade the attacks you use the most often in groups.


When choosing upgrades at the level cap, bear in mind that the last few levels in a given tier will not be upgraded in the next expansion that comes. This is due to the 14-level upgrade rule – this means those very high-level skills are good upgrade choices, as you will be using them a long time.

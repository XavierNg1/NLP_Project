 If making your Chihuahua homemade meals is not a feasible option, you can still find a healthy manufactured food. Protein from meat should be the number one ingredient in your Chihuahua’s diet, so look for one in which ingredients like chicken, lamb, beef, or fish are listed first on the nutrition label. Dog food companies are required to list ingredients in descending order, so this will ensure meat is the main ingredient. Meat meals are also acceptable as the main ingredient as they are a concentrated form of meat.


Stay away from any products that contain “digest” or animal by-products., Your Chihuahua also needs fat in their diet. But they need to be good sources of fat. Look for ingredients like chicken fat, fish oil, and omega-3 fatty acids on commercial dog food labels., If you decide to feed your dog a manufactured food, opt for kibble instead of wet food. Though your Chihuahua may prefer wet food, it can affect your dog’s bowels and cause runny bowel movements.Try drizzling some low-salt broth over your dog’s dry kibble if you’re having trouble getting them to eat their meal.If your dog is already eating wet food, plan to slowly switch them to dry kibble by mixing the wet and dry food. Begin with an 80/20 ratio of wet to dry food, making sure to cover the kibbles completely with the wet food. Add less and less wet food over an eight to ten day period until you end up with only dry kibble., Not all dog foods are created equal. Some brands are more committed to producing high quality dog food than others. Some highly recommended commercial brands for Chihuahuas include Orijen and Whole Earth Farms.Royal Canin and Eukanuba each offer a line of Chihuahua-specific dog foods.
In addition, many brands, including Wellness and Blue Buffalo, offer dog foods formulated especially for small breeds.

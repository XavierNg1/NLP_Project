A light seasoning of lemon, salt, and pepper is ideal while microwaving orange roughy.


Place the fish in a microwave-safe bowl, and place in the microwave. Cook with general heat for approximately 4 minutes, and check for doneness. If the fish does not flake easily with a fork, continue cooking for 30 second intervals until the fish appears to be completely cooked.

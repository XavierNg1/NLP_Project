 Take the egg in your fingertips and give it a gentle shake like a maraca. Concentrate on the feeling you get from the egg.





If the egg is hard boiled, it will feel solid like a rock.
If the egg is liquid, you will be able to feel the liquid inside moving and shifting as you shake it.
 Place the egg in a pot or bowl of very hot water (nearly boiling is best). Look for small streams of bubbles coming out of the shell of the egg. When the test is over, take the eggs out quickly unless you want them to boil.





If the egg is raw, you will see these bubbles. Egg shells are not completely solid â€” they are actually covered by thousands of tiny holes that sometimes can allow gases to pass through. Heating the egg makes the gas inside the shell to expand and pass through these holes, creating bubbles.If the egg is boiled, you probably won't see these bubbles because the gas was already forced out during the boiling process.
 Wait until night or head to a dark room with your egg and a bright flashlight. Turn the flashlight on and hold it against the side of the egg. This test works best with smaller flashlights so that the rim of the flashlight forms a tight "seal" against the egg shell.





If the egg lights up like a lantern, it is raw. The liquid inside allows the light through.
If the egg is dark and opaque, it is hard-boiled. The solid white and yolk do not let the light through.

 Clean any nail polish off, use a q-tip for any polish stuck around the edges. Apply either cuticle remover or rosewood oil onto your cuticles, and let sit while you file the nails straight across, and use a foot file, pumice stone, lemon, or your exfoliant of choice to soften the skin on your feet. Using an orange stick or other cuticle stick, gently push the cuticles down. Then buff your nails to a high shine. If you want, use Nail polish.;
, This will help your feet stay less dry and flaky, and help prevent future foot wrinkles!

, This keeps them from ever smelling funky. Spray on deodorant works well too. Another good method is to soak your feet before cutting your toenails in any kind of oil.

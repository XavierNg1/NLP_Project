 Football players and grapplers in sport have strong grips and in occupations - carpenters and other laborers have strong grips (and especially at the index finger). You must have knowledge on the workings and limitations of your hand and fingers. Knowledge and experience go hand in hand.;

Do a general warm-up. Such a general warm-up could include: brisk walking, jogging, cycling, circuit training, or any other invigorating activity such as washing a car. Keep the warm-up time between 10 - 20 minutes.
Next, do a few specific warm-up exercises. Estimate what phone book thickness you can easily rip and divide a book, at the spine, to those thicknesses and do at least two sub-maximal rips.
 But not as a quick one––think of it as more of a 100 meter (328.1 ft) sprint than a 10,000 meter (32,808.4 ft) run. The initial tearing of the book is powerful and the force needs to be sustained for several seconds.


Concentrate on your form and put out a lot of force quickly. There are two methods of applying force. The first method is to accelerate like a rocket launching. The second method is more impacting, like a karate chop breaking a brick or a short plank of wood. This article advocates using the second method and especially when ripping the thicker books. Whatever the case, even with a quick and powerful rip, if you have just moderate strength, your technique has to be perfect and with little room for error. The technique and strategy increase in complexity as the difficulty of performing the task increases; for example, compare ripping several sheets of paper versus ripping a 1,000 page phone book.
Review the many videos available online on the technique used by various people who have successfully ripped phone books.

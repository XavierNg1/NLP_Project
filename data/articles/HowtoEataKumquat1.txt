 Ripe kumquats range from bright orange to yellow-orange. Stay away from greenish, unripe fruits .The skin should be nice and firm, free of blemishes or shriveled areas., No matter where you got the kumquat, rub the peel under cool, running water. Since the peel is edible, you don't want any traces of pesticides or dirt on the surface. Pat the fruit dry with a paper towel.
 Some say that rubbing or squeezing the fruit between your fingers helps it release the sweet, citrus-like scent of the rind., The seeds are not poisonous, but they have the same bitter taste as orange seeds.If you're feeling dainty, slice the kumquat in half and pluck out the seeds. You can easily spit the seeds out as you eat instead, or even chew them up if you don't mind the flavor.


Pull off the nubs of green stems as well.
 Unusually, kumquats have a sweet rind and sour flesh. Nibble the end of the kumquat to taste the rind first. Once you encounter the mouth-puckering juice, you can either keep nibbling cautiously, or pop the whole fruit in your mouth. If you can stand it, the explosive wedding ceremony between tart and sweet is unique in the fruit world.


Some kumquat species are less sour than others, or have a thicker peel. If the flavor doesn't impress you, try to find a different type, or use the fruits in cooking.
If you hate the sour taste, squeeze out the juice and eat the peel by itself.
 Kumquats will last for about two days at room temperature, or about two weeks in an airtight, refrigerated container.You can eat them cold from the fridge or let them warm up first, whichever you prefer.

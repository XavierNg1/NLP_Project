 If your recipient has what seems like a few warehouses of small electronics or even just a few, try sewing a case for them. For example, an iPod or iPhone case. See How to Make an iPod cover for details. This method can also be used on many other small electronics.
 Use an old clean sock, perhaps one of those whose companion was lost in the blackhole of the washing machine or, if you sew, make a sewn version from an old t-shirt or scrap fabric. Great for all sorts of purposes from toys to back support cushions.
 If you are good at sewing, quick and inexpensive gifts can be made when you focus on the accessories. Try making belts, neck ties, hair accessories or shoe bows.
 For children and the young-at-heart, hand-made toys will be treasured for years to come. Choose cute fabrics, from vintage to eye-popping colors, dependent on the age and likes of the gift recipient.

 Carefully look over the mother’s teats on her underside. If you notice redness, swelling, pus, abscesses, or discolored milk, the dam might have mastitis. Mastitis occurs when the mother’s milk ducts become inflamed. This makes lactation and nursing very painful for the mother dog. If it is severe, the mother can become aggressive towards the puppies or refuse to nurse. A vet can treat mastitis with antibiotics.You can relieve the pain of mastitis by applying warm water compresses to the mother’s teats.
You can help stimulate the flow of milk by gently pressing the teat between your forefinger and thumb. Be aware that if the dog is in extreme pain, she may become aggressive.
 If your dog refuses to nurse and starts pacing excessively, she may have milk fever. Milk fever, also known as eclampsia, may cause the mother to refuse the puppies. Symptoms begin with restlessness or anxiety. The mother may start to walk with a stiff or wobbly gait. This can develop into tremors, spasms, heavy panting, and fever. If you suspect that the dam is suffering from these symptoms, take her to the vet immediately. If untreated, it can lead to death.Symptoms of milk fever typically begin between three and five weeks after the puppies are born., Even if you do not notice the symptoms of mastitis or milk fever, there may still be an underlying medical cause for the mother’s abandonment. Take both the mother and the puppies to the vet. The vet will do bloodwork and other tests to determine what is going wrong.Occasionally, something might be wrong with the puppies, causing the mother to abandon them. Your vet may be able to help them thrive.If the vet determines that there is no medical cause, they can help you try to encourage the mother dog to accept the puppies. The vet may also recommend that you feed and care for the puppies yourself.

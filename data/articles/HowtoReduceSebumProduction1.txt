 If you are struggling with excess oil and acne, you may want to talk to a dermatologist about retinoids. This type of medication is the most common treatment for acne and excess oil production. You can get an oral retinoid, like Accutane, or topic medications, like tretinoin, adapalene, tazarotene, or isotretinoin. Oral retinoids are generally more effective than topical ones.You may experience side effects like dry skin or sensitive skin.;
, Excess oil production can be caused by an excess of androgen hormones. If this is why your skin is oily, the doctor may prescribe you an androgen inhibitor, such as spironolactone and cyproterone. These medications can help reduce the amount of sebum your body produces. These medications may be either oral or topical., If you are a woman who has excess sebum production, you can try taking a birth control pill. For some women, this can help reduce the oiliness of their skin, but for others it might make it worse. Talk to your doctor about this option to determine if it is right for you.Birth control may help reduce the androgens in your body, which can help reduce your bodyâ€™s sebum production.
 Another procedure you may want to try to help your sebum production is light and laser therapy. Photo Dynamic Therapy and Diode Laser Therapy can work to decrease oil production from your sebaceous glands. Many people use light or laser therapy with other treatments to really reduce their sebum production.This is a good option for people who cannot use medication to treat their oily skin, such as pregnant women. These treatments are non-invasive and fairly safe.
You need to get multiple treatments to get the best results. These treatments can be expensive.

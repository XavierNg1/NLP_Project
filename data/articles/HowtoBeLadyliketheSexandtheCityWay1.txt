Carrie is romantic and led by her emotions. To follow your heart in a ladylike way, you must be gracious in defeat, courageous in a struggle and be prepared to laugh at yourself. In the episode The Real Me, (Season 4, Episode 2), Carrie trips on the runway whilst modelling in a fashion show. Although mortified, she gets up and finishes strutting her stuff to great applause, like a real lady. Handle yourself similarly in humiliating situations to be ladylike.;
, Carrie doesn't intentionally, publicly, belch, break wind, flash, moon, throw tantrums, talk down to people, insult shop staff or wait staff or, 'flash the cash'. Avoid these behaviours and similar. Carrie has been known to drink to excess and get Carried Away. Avoid this to be ladylike. Carrie also is an on / of smoker - smoking is proven to be detrimental to health, but it's a matter of opinion whether it's ladylike or not.
 Carrie loves Vogue, Christian Louboutin shoes, (amongst many others), Chanel, vintage telephones and romantic movies like, "The Way We Were". It's conceivably ladylike to prefer these sorts of things as opposed to OK!, Ugg Boots, Juicy Couture, iPhones and The Hunger Games.

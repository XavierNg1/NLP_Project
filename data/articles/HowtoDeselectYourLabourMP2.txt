 The NEC is formed of representatives of multiple different groups, so there is not much that a single member of the Labour Party can really do to influence the makeup of the NEC. However, you can choose which CLP reps to support, and you may be in a position to influence the choice of other reps, for example if you are a BAME Labour member you should, in theory, have a say in the representative of the BAME caucus on the NEC. Sometimes, organisations within the Labour Party, such as Progress or Momentum, will have slates (a set of candidates who they think should be elected). You can support the group which is most in line with your views.
 The NEC has the power to rule that an MP cannot stand in the next general election. Usually, this occurs if it is felt that the MP has done something so totally unacceptable that they should no longer represent the party. For example, sabotaging the Labour party politically by deleting information on important Bills or Acts of Parliament. If the NEC has a majority, then they can deselect the MP without needing the majority of local parties and union branches to agree.
 The NEC is the only body which can change the rules of the Labour Party. This could be used to help in the deselection process.. Alternatively, the NEC could go further and change the rules so that each MP must undergo a full leadership contest every time they want to stand for election, in effect abolishing the trigger ballot.

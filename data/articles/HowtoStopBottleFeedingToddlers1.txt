 While your child might not be able to completely drink from a cup independently, beginning at this age will help her to become familiar with the cup.Consider giving your baby a sippy cup to play with in order to get her familiar with the object.;
, At around one year of age, your child can begin drinking cow’s milk rather than formula. At the same time, you can introduce your child to drinking out of the cup (rather than just playing with it). Giving your child a new cup and a new drink at the same time may help her to make the transition.


If you notice any rash, redness, difficulty breathing, vomiting, or diarrhea when you give your child cow’s milk, consult your doctor right away. Your child may have an allergy to milk.
 If your child is stressed for some reason, such as that you just moved to a new house, you may want to delay taking away the bottles entirely, as this could cause further stress. Instead, wait for a time when your baby is in a good mood and generally stress free.Do not switch your baby entirely to cups if she is sick or just beginning preschool.
 When you include your child in your plans, she will most likely be more receptive to them. Talk to your child about how she will have to start using a cup soon because she is a ‘big girl’ now.Speak positively about the cup, and say that the bottle is only for babies.
If you have an older child, ask him or her to talk to your toddler about how big kids use cups. Your younger child may be more inclined to emulate her older sibling.

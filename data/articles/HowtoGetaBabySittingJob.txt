 Your experience can even be just having watched a little brother or sister, or helping out at a daycare.;
,, Determine how much you want to be paid, how many children you can handle, and what time you can babysit until. Discuss the pay with the parent if your price seems too high.
 Nobody's going to come to you if you don't advertise! Go around your neighborhood and look for people who are outside with children. Tell them that you can help babysit if they need help. Also you could always make little business cards and hand those out at church, school or if your neighborhood needs child care help! Tell them more about yourself! Post flyers, give out pamphlets.
 You will need to find out how many children will you need to take care of, what will be your pay, emergency numbers, and other safety concerns. Also, be certain to find out how you will get there and how you will get back home!

, After you have done a job, you can ask their parents if they can tell others about you. That way a lot of people would know that you can help!

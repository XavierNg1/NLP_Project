 Try olive oil with coarse salt, freshly ground pepper or a few hot red pepper flakes and chopped hardy herbs, such as rosemary, thyme, or sage.


You can also try garlic, butter, seasoning salt, or anything you prefer.
 Try mustard, mayonnaise, and herbs. Save some of the sauce and use it as a dip for your cooked potatoes.
 Coat the potatoes well with olive oil before sprinkling your favorite dried spices over the potatoes. Rub the spices all over the outside and edges.


Try salt, cumin, coriander, paprika, chili powder, allspice, freshly ground black pepper, and dried thyme with about 1-1/2 tsp. salt and a little sugar, if you like.
 If grilling in a packet, try adding other cut up vegetables to the same package to create unique taste combinations. Sliced onions, carrots or squash are good combinations for grilling with potatoes.

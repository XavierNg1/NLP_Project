, Make sure the gaps in the hoop (called Snare Gates) line up with the Snare mechanisms. Screw in the tension bolts so they don't fall out. Don't tighten too much.
 The T-Nut is what your Tension Bolts screw into instead of Lugs, you can see them inside the Suspension Ring. The general idea is you're trying to get the snare side of the system pre-leveled before you put the shell in.
 Here is where it gets a little tricky. Snares have a little depression in the shell called a Snare Bed. It is vital that the snares are aligned correctly with the snare bed. To find the snare bed on your shell, look for either a sticker or a shallow cut on the inside on the shell.


This snare has a small dot instead of those.
 An easy way to do this is to take two opposite sided tension bolts, and screw them in just enough that the suspension ring or the top of the T-nut stops moving.
 Don't tighten it too much, 2 turns should be enough., Because of the way Sleishman drums work, the bottom head won't have similar tension on all of the bolts. So go around and tighten any bolts that are very loose. Don't over tighten, you're aiming for as close to the same tension on each bolt as you can.
 As Sleishman drums are under constant refining, this article won't discuss how to attach the snares to the snare mechanism. However, once again, make sure that the snare wires are sitting directly in the middle of the snare bed and in the middle of the drum. If you get it off, it will have an undesirable sound.
 Because you've set up the drum already, all your tuning happens from the top head., How you tune your snares is you tighten them up and tap on the drum lightly. If it sounds like a tom, it's too tight. Start loosening it up until you can hear the snares responding to your lightest touch. Once you've done that, your snare drum is done.

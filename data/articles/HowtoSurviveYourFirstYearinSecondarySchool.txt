 If someone looks lonely, then say hello to them, and smile! You might discover some great friends, if you only look for them.;
, Don't stick only to the people in your classes or the ones that seem most similar to you.
 They will see right through you.
 It can be annoying, but that's better than the teachers getting on your case about it.
 It will make getting into college much easier.
 If you are friendly, helpful, and honest towards everyone, the people that really matter will notice. Let the gossipers talk all they want; they're just jealous of people with real friends.
 See How To Be Confident for advice.
 Don't be afraid to ask them why they're doing something, or ask questions in class, but don't be rude or insulting either. If you're unsure about how to say something to them, talk to them after class.
 Take notes, have your locker (if you have one) non-cluttered and organized. Try not to talk to people between periods if you think you'll be late for class.

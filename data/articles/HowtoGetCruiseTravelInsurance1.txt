 Most cruise insurance policies will cover you for any expenses that come with the interruption of your cruise.;
, If you need to cancel your cruise because of illness or injury, your insurance policy will reimburse you for the money you paid.
 Not all cruise insurance policies will cover medical expenses, but if your health insurance is not comprehensive, you might want to consider buying a policy that will reimburse you for out of pocket medical expenses.


Think about how you will pay for a hospital visit if you trip and break an ankle, for example, or if you come down with appendicitis and need emergency surgery while on your cruise.
 A good cruise insurance policy will cover you if your baggage is lost or you miss a flight connection that causes the cruise ship to leave without you.



Check policies careful before you buy. For example, some policies will reimburse you only within a certain number of days. Suppose a war breaks out in your cruise destination 30 days before you are scheduled to arrive there. Your policy might only cover wars that begin within 10 days of your arrival. These are things to check for in coverage descriptions.
 You might be booked on a cruise for later this year, and before your scheduled departure date the cruise line goes bankrupt. Only an insurance policy that covers this type of default will ensure you are reimbursed for the cruise.


Look for this specific coverage if you decide to buy the policy offered by your cruise line. Many cruise line specific insurance policies do not include this.
 No insurance policy will reimburse you because it rained every day of your cruise.


Do not expect to be able to file an insurance claim because it rained on your beach days or because a port of call was switched or canceled.

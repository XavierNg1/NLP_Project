 Use cold water to rinse your fruit of any dirt. Washing the fruit will keep you from consuming any pesticides that may be on the surface of the fruit. Pat your fruit dry with a paper towel., It is up to you as to whether or not you want to chop up smaller fruit like strawberries, but it generally recommended that you chop up larger fruit, as it will make it much easier to freeze. Cut your apples into slices, cube your melons, and quarter fruit like apricots.
 Make sure that your fruit is in one layer without any pieces overlapping. If they overlap while they freeze, your pieces might fuse together. Place the tray in the freezer., Once your fruit has frozen completely, you can take it off the baking sheet and move it to a freezer container.


You can also store frozen fruit in a resealable bag. Better yet, if you have a vacuum sealer, you can also use it to store your fruit. Vacuum sealers remove all air from your storage bag. If frozen food is exposed to the air, the food might develop a strange flavor.

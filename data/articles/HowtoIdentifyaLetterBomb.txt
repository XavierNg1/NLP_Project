 Letter bombs can be small, but flat, thin envelopes are very unlikely to contain them.;
, If they do not exist be very wary. Try searching for reviews on the companies services to make sure they are legit. Be aware that companies will almost never hand write addresses, and will usually (although not always) use pre-pay stamps.
 As said above, pre-pay stamps usually are a good sign, while many smaller stamps could be a cause for concern.
 Letter bombs are usually bulky, and can be of an irregular shape, with many protrusions. When inspecting, never apply pressure to the parcel, or push down on any lumps or bumps, as this could trigger an explosion.
 Most companies do not use string, but secure boxes, or neatly applied tape. String is a sign of poor packaging, and maybe someone who does not have the equipment to professionally package a parcel.
 If there is an opening, take a look to see whether you can see wires, or any other suspicious items.
 If there are any fingerprints of oil, or oil soaking through the package then immediately move away, or place the item safely outside. This is the same with protruding wires.

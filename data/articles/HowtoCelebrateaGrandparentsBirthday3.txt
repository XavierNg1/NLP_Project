 If you don’t live close enough to your grandparents to visit, make sure you get in touch for their birthday! Call them, email them, or write them a letter, depending on what technology they’re most comfortable with.
 If they have asked to go out for their birthday, plan the excursion for them. Depending on their interests, make dinner reservations, buy show tickets, or arrange a tour guide. Make sure you arrange transportation and payment for them., If your grandparent would prefer to stay at home or visit you for their birthday, plan for a small celebration in your home or theirs. Keep it small and low-key--a small cake should be enough!, If you know that your relatives often forget to call or visit, remind them of your grandparent’s upcoming birthday ahead of time. Many grandparents would appreciate hearing from all of their children and grandchildren, and helping make that happen would be a great birthday gift., Quiet time together is the perfect opportunity to wish your grandparent a happy birthday and tell them about your love and respect for them. If you feel awkward speaking directly to them, write it down in a birthday card and give it to them.

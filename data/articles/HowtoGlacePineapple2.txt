 Pour 1 1/2 cups (355 ml) of water into a large, heavy pot and stir in 1/2 cup (100 g) of sugar. Turn the heat on to medium-high and bring the mixture to a boil. Stir it occasionally as the sugar begins to dissolve. This will make a very light syrup., Add 12 pineapple rings to the syrup. Boil the pineapple rings in the syrup for 5 to 10 minutes. You may have to stir the mixture to ensure that the pineapple rings are completely covered by the syrup.You can use fresh peeled and sliced pineapple rings or pineapple rings from a can.
 Turn the heat down to medium and cook the pineapple rings for 30 minutes. The rings will soften and the syrup will thicken., Turn off the heat and leave the pineapple rings in the pot for 10 minutes. The syrup will cool a little and coat the pineapple rings., Set a baking tray next to the pot of candied pineapple. Place a sheet of parchment paper on the tray. Carefully lift the pineapple rings out of the syrup and set them on the paper and leave them to completely cool. You can serve the candied pineapple on its own or as a garnish for other desserts.You can use the syrup in recipes calling for a heavy syrup or use it to flavor drinks.
Store the leftover candied pineapple rings in an airtight container for about a week. The pineapple rings may crystallize over time.

 Insert the thumb drive into the appropriate slot on your computer.
 Sometimes your computer will automatically prompt or simply open the file explorer for the thumb drive. If not, you'll need to navigate to the file explorer for the drive. On a Windows computer, this is done by going to My Computer, and then selected the thumb drive from the options on the left. It will usually be labeled with the thumb drive manufacturer's name.
 Copy all of the files that you do not want to delete to a temporary location on your computer.
 Take a boring file that you don't care about and copy it onto the thumb drive until it is completely full. Then delete all of the copies.
 Replace the files that you wanted to keep on the drive. You are now done and your file should be securely deleted.

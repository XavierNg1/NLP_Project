 Do not use system restore since when you create a restore point the viruses file's are also backed up.;
, That way you will be sure once yo remove the virus it will be off your computer.
 Some good choices for anti-virus software are Bitdefender Free Edition, Avast Home Edition, and Avg Free Edition. Only have one of these installed at a time and make sure to update them before you run them. For anti-spyware software you can download Ad-Aware Free Edition or Spybot Search and Destroy.


Note: You might have to download your anti-virus and anti-spyware software on a non-infected PC then put the file's on a disk and bring them to the infected PC.
 Make sure you write down the name of the infection it finds before you remove them.
 Use the (F5 or F8) keys depending on which OS you are running.

 If you have a mortgage on your home, you may want to consider using your tax refund to refinance it or to make an extra payment on it. Both of these options can significantly reduce the interest that you pay on your mortgage over time.Check whether your mortgage has any pre-payment penalties associated with it. Prepay fees typically range from $200 to $500, but borrowers can generally pay up to 20% of their loan balance each year before the prepay fee kicks in.If you have a large balance on your mortgage, only make additional payments if you have already paid off your other debt and have sufficient savings.If you do decide to prepay, make sure you stress to your lender that you want your payment to go towards your principal. If you do not specify this, the lender may not apply the amount paid towards your principal.

Not only will you feel much better without all this debt, but you will also have extra income each month once it's paid off.If you have several sources of debt, pay off the debt with the highest interest rate first. This is the loan that you are paying the most interest on, so it makes sense to eliminate it first. Then pay off the debt with the second-highest interest rate, and so on, until all your debt is paid off. This is known as the avalanche method.
Another method, known as snowballing, takes the opposite approach. You pay off the smallest debt, thereby immediately eliminating one payment from your list of debts (paying of your largest debt or the debt with the highest interest payment may take some time, while paying off your smallest debt can potentially be done in a single payment). This has the added benefit of improving your morale and motivation â€” these "quick wins" will make paying off all your debt seem more doable., If you have children, the thought of having to pay for college one day is probably terrifying.

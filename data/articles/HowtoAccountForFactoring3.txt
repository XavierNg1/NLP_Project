 If you are having cash flow issues, your customers take a long time to pay, or you need to spend a large amount of money on raw materials before you even start a job, factoring may work well for you. The small fee you pay is the trade-off for getting cash immediately in exchange for your receivables., Over time you may be losing a lot of money that you are paying as fees to the factoring company. It might be more profitable to get a line of credit from a bank to help with cash flow, secured with your receivables. However factoring might be the best solution if you have bad credit, an unproven business venture, or nothing to offer as collateral., Companies such as The Receivables Exchange let you post your receivables on their private website, and then factoring companies bid on them. You might get better financing rates as a result.

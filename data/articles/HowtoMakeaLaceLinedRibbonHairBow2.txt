 Make a circle with the ribbon and stick both ends together with the tape.
 See the image for closer guidance. Wrap a small band, thread or ribbon around the middle and knot to keep the bow permanently pinched in place.
 This is the bow upon the bow, shown in the images as the black satin ribbon bow.


Cut the smaller black ribbon to a length of 15cm/5.9".
Cut another piece to a length of 5cm/1.9".
Fold the long ribbon length into a bow (see final image box in previous step).
 Use the center of the small bow as the midpoint. Wrap this with a band, thread or ribbon and knot to keep firmly in place.


Attach to the larger bow, at its midpoint. Use the same wrapping item as for before.
Wrap the smaller piece of cut black ribbon around the middle of both bows, to disguise the join. Glue neatly in place, wiping away any excess glue immediately.

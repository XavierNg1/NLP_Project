 A rubber mat attached to the bottom with suction cups will protect your sink from dirty dishes and scuffs made by pots and pans. Find an inexpensive mat at your local home store and use it every time you do dishes. Prevent any additional stains and watermarks by removing the mat when it’s not in use., Get into the habit of wiping your sink after each use to prevent yellowing or staining in the first place. Use a small amount of dish soap on a wet, soft rag or sponge and thoroughly wipe your white sink down. Rinse the soap with water and completely dry the sink with a paper towel or other dry cloth., Things like coffee, tea or grease can stain white porcelain or fire clay. Make sure you don’t leave half-filled, dripping coffee cups or dirty frying pans in your sink overnight. The longer dirty plates stay in your sink, the longer stains have to set in.
 Polish and give your sink a protective coating with lemon oil. Add several drops of lemon essential oil to a soft, dry cloth to coat your white sink with. Remember to dry your sink out first before adding shine and repelling residue with lemon oil.

 Melt 1 tablespoon of salted butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. If you’ve got one, use a cast-iron skillet. While salted butter isn’t your only option – it’s widely accepted to be the best. For instance, mayo will work, but is best for American cheese on white bread – not quite worthy of “gourmet” status.In fact, your butter can be the source of your sandwich’s sophistication. Try truffle butter, herbed butter, or garlic butter.
 Before placing the sandwich in the pan, press it down gently. Avoid crushing any of your gourmet ingredients, or press hard enough to keep it all together. After three minutes, use a spatula to peak at the side of the sandwich that’s been cooking. If it’s golden brown, you’ve nailed it. Hurry up and flip your sandwich over., Lift the sandwich with a spatula and inspect the skillet’s surface. If the sandwich lifted without resistance, and there is still an buttery sheen to the skillet’s surface, carefully flip your sandwich and begin cooking the other side. Give it three minutes and check to see if the bread has browned to perfection.Add a bit more butter between sides if the sandwich sticks to the surface or the skillet looks dry when you check it.
 Carefully transfer your sandwich from the pan to a plate of your choosing. Garnish per the recipe you’re working with, or with something that will simply boost the visual appeal of your sandwich. A single stalk of parsley or another well-placed bit of herb, albeit simple, will not only look good, but will call attention to the fact that you put care and attention into the sandwich. Finally: enjoy!

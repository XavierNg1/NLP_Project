 Try to use distilled water if you can, as tap water has too many chemicals and mineral in it, which can affect the outcome of your diffuser. If you need to, use a funnel to help guide the water into the bottle.


If you can't fin a diffuser bottle, any small bottle with a short, narrow neck (such as a perfume bottle) will do. Make sure that the bottle is glass, as essential oils tend to degrade certain types of plastic.
 If you can't find any vodka, you can also try witch hazel or rubbing alcohol instead.
 You can use equal parts vanilla and cinnamon essential oil, or you can play around with different proportions. For example, you could do 7 drops of cinnamon essential oil and 5 drops of vanilla essential oil. You need 12 drops of oil total.
 Plug the bottle up with a cork or your finger. If the bottle came with a screw-on cap, use that instead. Shake it briskly to combine the ingredients, then open it back up again.
 You may not notice any fragrance right away. There is still one more step you have to do. Right now, you are just soaking the reeds.
 Take the reeds out of the bottle, and turn them around. Stick the dry ends back into the bottle, and place the bottle down on a table. Your room will eventually get a soft, vanilla-cinnamon fragrance.


Reverse the reeds once a week.

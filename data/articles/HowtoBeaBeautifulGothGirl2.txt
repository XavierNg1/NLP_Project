 While Traditional Goth's tend to be all about the 80's music scene, Romantic Goth's focus on the dark, sensual and mysterious world of Gothic created by Victorian literature and subsequent movies. In other words they’re probably more “Gothic” than “Goth,” if that makes sense. Identifying features are velvet and lace, flowy clothes (often Victorian or Medieval inspired), and a love of poetry and literature.
 It is unsurprising that Romantic Goth's are typically emotional, creative and dreamy types. Dead roses, crumbling graveyards and old skulls are things of exquisite beauty to these creatures. Preferred bands tend to be those that focus on “brooding” rather than “horror,” and so may include down tempo ethereal bands (eg. Love Spirals Downwards), and folk-ish bands (All About Eve, Faith and the Muse). The Sisters of Mercy and The Cure tend to go down well too. And of course a bit of atmospheric Classical music, especially Bach or Wagner.
 Victorian fashions like corsets, lace, frock coats and pale skin are popular throughout the scene, but maybe none wear them with as much style as the Victorian Goth.
 Clothes must be smart and, for many, historically accurate (corsets are to be worn beneath one’s garments, of course). Ball dress and mourning garb are particularly prominent in the scene.
 This includes theatre, masquerades, tea parties and poetry. And, naturally, any kind of Dickensian or other Victorian festival that gives them an excuse to parade around in costume (not that they need an excuse).

 This method is an ideal option if you interact with your customers in person.


Advise your customers to complete the questionnaires and return them to you. If you have a business location or office, you can also install a box at your business in which customers can drop the completed forms.
You can also have the testimonial questionnaire developed into postcards with prepaid postage. This will allow customers to take them home and fill them out at their convenience before mailing them back to you.
 The questionnaire can be sent to your customers after they have used your service or product.


Allow a sufficient amount of time to pass in which customers can use your product before sending the testimonial. For example, if you sold a teeth whitening product that takes up to 3 months to work efficiently, send your customer the testimonial letter after 3 months have passed so they can provide an appropriate testimonial.
Include an envelope with prepaid postage or send the testimonial printed on a prepaid postcard so your customers can return the feedback to you free of charge.
 This is ideal if your customers reside in your local area and you have a number of regular customers who utilize your products or services on a regular basis.


Reserve a local venue such as a hotel conference room, or book a room at a restaurant and provide catering or refreshments for your customers.
Invite your regular customers to a public venue in which you can videotape them sharing positive experiences and testimonials about your business.
Hire or enlist a person experienced in video or photography to film the event who can produce professional footage.
Play the testimonial video at your place of business or feature the video on your website.
 Your close friends and family can help you with testimonials if you have recently started a business or have recently decided to collect customer testimonials.

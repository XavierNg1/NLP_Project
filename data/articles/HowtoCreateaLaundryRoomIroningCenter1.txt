 You will be building a small, thin shelf to hold supplies and grab the ironing board. So you’ll need not only an area to house the items, but enough space to allow the ironing board to comfortably be used. If your laundry room isn’t feasible, consider a large closet or spare bedroom for your organizing system.


Make sure you have room on one wall to mount a shelf that will hold your ironing board. Check the wall to ensure you can drive screws into it and that its sturdy enough to hold the supplies.;
, You’ll need a 10-ft. piece of 1x8 and a 2-ft. piece of 1x6. This will be used to create the shelves and overall structure.
 Look for a set that comes with its own pair of screws or mounting materials.
 Big tools you’ll need include a jigsaw, electric screwdriver, clamps, nail gun and safety equipment (glasses and gloves).

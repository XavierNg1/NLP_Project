 Put on warm clothes. Then layer on a jacket and a nice warm pair of long pants.
 Find a nice spot outside. Try the balcony. Maybe you have a lovely terrace, or patio. Pull up a chair and have a seat.
 Put on some gloves so your fingers won't freeze. Whether you're drawing a hummingbird with watercolors, or your favorite movie character with markers, drawing or doodling is a great way to relax.
 Listen to music. You can play it from a stereo, or give your MP3 Player some speakers because music always feels good.
 You can write about your trip to the beach with your friend, or about the insane dream you had the night before. Or you can make a few entries in that journal you have been meaning to keep.
 Now, you can relax outside and watch the world around you.

 The main difference between nominal and real GDP is that real GDP takes inflation into account. If you don't take inflation into account, you could believe that a country's GDP is increasing when really their prices are increasing.


Think about it like this. If GDP of country A was $1 billion in 2012, but in 2013 it printed and then circulated $500 million, of course its GDP is going to be bigger in 2013 than it was in 2012. But this increase isn't a good reflection of the goods and services produced in country A. Real GDP effectively discounts these inflationary increases.
 Your base year can be a year back, five years, 10, or even 100. But you need to choose a year against which to compare the inflation. Because, at heart, real GDP is a comparison. And a comparison is only really a comparison if two or more things — years and figures — are being weighed against one another. For a simple real GDP calculation, choose the year prior to the year you're looking at.
 This number is also called the "deflator." If your rate of inflation from the base year to the current year is 25%, for example, you'd list that inflationary rate as 125, or 1 (100%) plus .25 (25%) times 100. For all cases of inflation, the deflator is going to be higher than 1.

If, for example, the country that you're measuring actually experienced deflation, where purchasing power increased instead of decreased, the deflator would drop below 1. Say, for example, the rate of deflation was 25% from the base period to the current period. That means the currency can buy 25% more than it used to in its base period. Your deflator would be 75, or 1 (100%) minus .25 (25%) times 100.
 Real GDP is equal to the ratio of your nominal GDP divided by 100. As an equation, it starts off like this: Nominal GDP ÷ Real GDP = Deflator ÷ 100.


So, if your current nominal GDP is $10 million, and your deflator is 125 (inflation was 25% from the base period to the current period), this is how you'd set up your equation:

$10,000,000 ÷ Real GDP = 125 ÷ 100
$10,000,000 ÷ Real GDP = 1.25
$10,000,000 = 1.25 X Real GDP
$10,000,000 ÷ 1.25 = Real GDP
$8,000,000 = Real GDP

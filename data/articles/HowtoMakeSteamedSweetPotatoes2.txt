 This classic combination tastes just as good on sweet potatoes as it does on normal potatoes. It's not fancy, but it's always a fine choice.


If you wish, you can simply toss the potatoes with butter, salt, and pepper once they finish steaming. However, if you're dining with picky eaters, you may want to serve the potatoes plain with butter, salt, and pepper on the side so everyone can have as much as they want.
 Garlic may not seem like a good accompaniment for sweet potatoes, but its zesty flavor actually compliments the vegetable's smoothness well. Don't use too much, however, as it can overpower the mild flavors of sweet potatoes easily. Here's just one way to make a garlicky sweet potato dish:Steam the potatoes as normal.
Add olive oil, chopped garlic, and rosemary to a serving bowl with the potatoes. Stir well to combine and coat the potatoes evenly.
Garnish with ground pumpkin seeds for presentation.
 Onion is another savory vegetable that pairs well with sweet potatoes. Like garlic, it's something you won't want to add too much of or you risk overpowering the potatoes. For best results, use white, yellow, or sweet onions — red onions have a little less sugar, so they're less sweet.Adding onions to a sweet potato dish is easy: just chop half an onion into small bits and steam them in the pot along with the potatoes.
 Adding just the right spices to sweet potatoes can make them taste like a dessert without adding any extra calories. Sweet, pungent spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves tend to go best with sweet potatoes.


Sprinkle very lightly at first — you can always add more, but you can't take the spices off once you've already added them.

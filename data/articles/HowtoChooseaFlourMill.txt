 It's a good idea to see if you can test each type as well as knowing their features, because this will give you the chance to see which you like working with the most. Do you have a friend or neighbor who already has one you can try? The main types of flour mill are:


Hand cranked burr grinder: This can become tiring when used for a lot of grain on a regular basis. The romance soon disappears!
Stand mixer attachment: This can be fitted onto an already existing powerful mixer.
Electric impact grill
Electric stone grinder
;
, If you're only going to be making flour occasionally for fun, the hand grinder version will probably be fine. But if you're going to bake bread regularly, or more than one loaf at a time, go for an electric version to save energy and time.
 When it comes down to actually choosing a mill, ask the following questions:


Is it able to take the amount of grains you want done within a reasonable amount of time?
Are there any known issues about it overheating when it grinds the grain? (You can check people's opinions about individual products online.)
Is it easy or complicated? If you don't like complicated items, be sure it is simple and straightforward to use.
Think about the cleaning. Does it appear to be easy to clean, with pieces coming apart or not?
Look for the ability to adjust between fine or coarse grinding. Does it offer adequate degrees of coarseness for your needs?

, Also be sure to ask if it is easy to source replacement parts if something goes wrong. Grinding can be tough on a flour mill and if a part breaks, you don't want to be left with something useless.
 This might be enough to convince you whether or not it works.

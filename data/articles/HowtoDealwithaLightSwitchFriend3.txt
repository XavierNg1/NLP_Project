 Every day, set a goal for how many minutes you don't talk to her, and even if it is ignoring, it was your decision to move away from them. You could set something like: At the end of this month, we will hardly even know each other, or talk to each other.
 You could switch your classes, or do anything to promote less contact with this person. If you can't do this, try not to make any contact, unless you're forced to.

 The legal custodian, not just the physical custodian, can petition to change the minor's name. Legal custody is usually determined by divorce proceedings and court orders. If there is shared legal custody, both parents must agree on the minor's name change.If one parent or custodians petition to change the name, the other parent or biological parents must be served notice of the change.
 File a petition with the Probate Court in the county where the minor lives. Be sure to check your specific county for name change fees, since they vary. Note that you can fill out the form online, print it out, and file it with the court. If you pick up the form from the office, you'll be charged an additional fee. If you print it out at home, the court has strict rules about the quality of the printed forms. Be sure to check the technical printer requirements. You'll need to fill out a name change form (CN-2) with the following information:The minor's current full legal name and date of birth
The address of the minor
The name of the petitioner
The address and telephone number of the petitioner
The new name requested for the minor
A brief statement of the reason for the name change request.
 Once you've filled out the name change petition, you'll need to file a certified copy of the minor's birth certificate. If the name change is a result of a divorce, you'll also need to include a certified copy of the divorce decree.Depending on your situation and county requirements, you may need to provide a court order concerning custody of the minor or the death certificate of the deceased custodian.

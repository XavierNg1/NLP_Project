 Apply denatured alcohol on a clean, soft cloth and wipe the surface with the cloth to remove dirt and other impurities. If the wood has a finish, you'll need to remove it. You can either sand it off, which takes a lot of work, or you can use chemical strippers.


If you choose to remove the finish using chemical strippers, do the work in a well-ventilated area. They contain very harsh chemicals, such as methylene chloride,which can do serious damage to your eyes, lungs, and skin.
Shellac and lacquer can be removed with just denatured alcohol.
 Common household bleach contains chlorine, which works for dye stainsand may work to remove set-in ink. Another choice is a wood bleach containing oxalic acid. Oxalic acid is great for iron-based stains, which covers some types of ink. Yet another choice is two-part wood bleach. The first part contains sodium hydroxide and the second part has hydrogen peroxide. The former open up the pores of the wood, while the latter reacts to the former. You can find either type of wood bleach at any hardware store.

As with any other harsh chemicals, be sure that your work area gets plenty of air. Use gloves to protect your skin and wear a mask to protect your lungs.
When working with two-part bleach, use separate cloths for each part to prevent the two chemicals from reacting with each other.
 Work it into the stained area with a clean cloth, avoiding getting any on the surrounding wood. Let it sit on the surface for 10 minutes. Repeat the process if necessary.
 Carefully wipe away the bleach with a cloth dampened in water. Avoid touching the surrounding wood. Follow up with another damp cloth and use it to wipe the entire surface. Next, towel it dry. Wait at least 24 hours before refinishing it.

 Add 5 kiwis that have been peeled and sliced into rounds, 3 clementines that have been peeled and separated into segments, 2 peeled bananas that have been cut into rounds, 2 cored and diced pears, 2 cored and diced yellow apples, and 2 tablespoons (3 g) of finely chopped fresh mint to a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon or salad tongs to ensure that the fruit is well mixed.You can substitute mandarin oranges for the clementines.
Golden delicious and ginger gold are good yellow apple options.;
, Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of fresh lime juice and 1 tablespoon (21 g) of honey to a separate small bowl. Use a whisk to blend the two together until they’re fully combined.You can substitute lemon juice for the lime if you prefer.
 Once the lime juice and honey are combined, add the mixture to the bowl of fruit. Use your wooden spoon or salad tongs to toss the salad well so all of the fruit is covered with the dressing., After you’ve tossed the salad, cover the bowl with a piece of plastic wrap. Place it in the refrigerator, and allow it to chill for approximately 2 hours so the flavors can meld before you serve it.If you prefer, you can serve the salad right after you finish tossing it at room temperature. It will become more flavorful if you chill it, but you’ll still have a delicious salad.

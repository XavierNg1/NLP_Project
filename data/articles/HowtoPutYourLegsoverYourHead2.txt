 A brisk walk around the house or some jumping jacks can be useful. Or, do a short dance, run on the spot or jump rope.;
, This might be a shelf, a chair/couch back, a window ledge, etc. Check that you can put your leg onto that with ease. This is not meant to be a hard height, it must be something that you can reach with ease for now. Place your foot onto the item and stretch the leg while doing so. Keep stretching while holding your leg on this height, keeping the stretch longer each time. Do this for each leg a few times a day for at least a week. This will improve your flexibility and increase your legs' strength.
 When it doesn't hurt at all to this anymore, aim a little higher next. Find a slightly higher shelf or ledge and practice the same routine until it too becomes comfortable and easy. Then raise the level again until your legs are stretching really high with relative ease.


Take care not to strain your legs.
For now, keep resting them on a stable object of some kind. Even the wall is fine if you can't find anything higher to rest on.
, This is going to be harder as there is no longer a support, just your legs in the air. Work on lifting up one leg at a time, working on your balance when holding that leg in the air.
 In time, it will become easier until you can do this without feeling as if you'll lose your balance or that it's too hard. Just be sure to give yourself a lot of time to achieve this, as it won't happen overnight for most people. It may take up to a year to be able to perfect this, so practice and patience are much needed to achieve success.

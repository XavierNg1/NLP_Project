 If you have a dermal filler infection right after your procedure, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. Antibiotics that are commonly used to treat dermal filler infections also contain anti-inflammatory properties. They may be prescribed for up to six weeks., This medication is commonly prescribed alongside antibiotics. Hyaluronidase helps to dissolve the hyaluronic acid fillers from the injection that may be clogged or inside the infected area.Some people are allergic to hyaluronidase, so you may have to test it on your arm first.
 For more serious infections, the doctor may decide to inject the infected areas with antibiotics. This may be given up to three times. There should be one week between the first and second injections, then there will be two weeks between the second and third injection., Your doctor may decide that you need to have the filler they injected into your face or any infected pus removed. This will help clear your pores of debris so they can heal. This procedure will be performed in the doctor’s office., One way that you can avoid infections is to start treating potential infections before you get the dermal filler injections. If you start taking antibiotics prior to the procedure, it could help prevent any infections occurring afterwards.Talk to your doctor about trying preventative antibiotic therapy before your injections.
 Certain conditions may put you at a greater risk for infection after a dermal filler injection. You shouldn’t get them if you already have an infection around your face, including pimples or rashes. People who have dermatitis should also not receive dermal fillers. If you have infections in the nose or mouth, like sinusitis, periodontal disease, throat infections, or abscessed teeth, you should not get this procedure.For example, people with the herpes simplex virus, human papilloma virus, impetigo, mollusca contagiosa, or yeast infections near the injection site shouldn’t get them.

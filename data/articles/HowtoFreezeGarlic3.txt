 Separate the cloves from it and peel them.
 Add oil in the ratio of 2 parts oil to 1 part garlic.


Olive oil is a good choice, or a less strong flavored vegetable oil of your choosing.
 Transfer to a freezer-proof container with a lid to prevent odor transference.
 Stick a teaspoon or butter knife in and retrieve as much oily garlic as needed for such things as making pasta sauce, adding garlic flavor to meats, stews and other dishes and for adding to stir-fries or saut√©e-ing.


Do not let this mixture sit at room temperature; either keep it frozen or heat it up immediately.

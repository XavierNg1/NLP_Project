 While the oven is heating, grease a 30 centimeter (11.8 in) x 20 centimeter (7.9 in) tin and line with baking paper.

Ensure the dimensions of the tin are accurate. If they aren't, the cake will turn out either too thin and weak, or too thick and hard to eat.;
, Continue until the mixture is light and fluffy.

Pour the sugar in slowly while mixing, or add a little in between mixing to make sure that the sugar is properly combined.
 Mix well.

Make sure you beat the egg yolk properly.
The flour and baking powder must be sifted, so the finished cake will come out light and not dense.
The mixture's consistency should resemble that of fine breadcrumbs.
 Make sure that it is firm and evenly spread.

Repeatedly pat the base down so it can retain its shape.
 Remove from the oven to cool for five minutes, then increase the oven temperature to 180 °C (356 °F) (356 fahrenheit).

If the base is let to cool properly, it will harden and won't fall apart when the additional layers are added.
 Add the sugar a little at a time while continuing to beat the mixture until it is thick and glossy.

An electric hand mixer or stand mixer is recommended.
Again, it is best to add the sugar a little at a time.
 Be careful when doing this., Spread the coconut and egg topping over it.

Avoid mixing the jam with the coconut layer. Keep everything separate and uniform.
 Cool in the tin for ten to fifteen minutes, and cut into squares.

If the Louise cake isn't cooled for long enough, it can break apart when cut, and burn.
If it is also immediately stored in a container, the container will steam up and the cake will soften.
Optionally top with fresh raspberries.
 Louise cake can be kept in an airtight container for up to a week.

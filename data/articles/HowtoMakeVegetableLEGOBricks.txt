 Many vegetables are suitable, including carrots, potatoes, squash, and rutabagas. You could also use firm tofu and add a food color to the water, which the tofu will soak up. You can do this with the vegetables, too. Be bold!;
, Boil or steam the vegetables so they are soft but not mushy. Soak them for a couple minutes in salt water. This will make them a little firmer by drawing out some of the moisture.
 As with real LEGO pieces, you will need to decide what bricks you would like to make: a single stud square brick, the four stud square, or the six stud rectangle. ("Stud" refers to the little bumps on top of real LEGO bricks).
 This will create a round hole and will push out the inside the vegetable brick. Be sure to match holes with the LEGO stud arrangement you're creating.
 This ensures that it looks like a LEGO brick, complete with studs!

, If it's not, carefully press a stud back in, or poke one farther out.
 Your kids will be delighted!

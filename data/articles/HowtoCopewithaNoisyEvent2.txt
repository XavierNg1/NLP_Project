 This is the aspect over which you will have the most control. Arrive late, leave early, or take a break., Ask the host, the DJ, the waiter, or anyone else who might have control, if they can help limit the noise. If no one knows it's bothering you, no one is going to do anything about it., You won't have control over all events and venues, but if a group of colleagues is headed out to eat, see if you can steer them toward a quieter place. Often, the first person to suggest a restaurant can persuade a group.

Suggest an early or late lunch, if no time is set, at a time when the restaurant might not be so crowded.
 Is there an outdoor patio or balcony, a back room, a lobby, or even a restroom where you could take a break, or carry on a conversation?

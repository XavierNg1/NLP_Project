 If you look at a ready-to-use cable tie, notice that one end tapers to a point, while the other is capped with a tiny cube. When used, the pointy end is fed through a slot in the cube to form a loop and then pulled tight. The cube is the locking mechanism that keeps the tie from worming back out through the slot, so look for that.

, Notice how the loose end tends to curve over the locking mechanism once it’s fed through it. You want access to that side of the cube, so bend the tie back to expose it some more.
 Look underneath the loose end where it comes out of the cube. Use your fingernail or any tool you may need (like a nail or pocket-size screwdriver) to push down on the bar that you find there. This releases the locking mechanism.
 Keep pushing down on the bar. As you do, use your other hand to slowly draw the loose end back through the cube. Once it’s out, you’re all done!

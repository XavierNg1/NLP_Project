 Remember that the Belbus only drives in specific areas, and it is possible that you will have to change buses, so allow extra time if necessary. Visit this site to find out if there is a bus stop near you, and at your destination. Remember, when you make a reservation, you will need to tell the phone operator where the bus stop is at your destination.;
, Book the Belbus at least 2 hours before your departure; ideally, you should book the bus one day before. Note that the rules for making a reservation may vary from town to town. If you plan to use the Belbus all week, you can mention this to the operator and they will make arrangements. Usually, the operator will ask you the following questions:


What is your name/client number?
When would you like to depart (date and time)?
Which bus stop will you depart from?
What is your destination?
Will you return with the Belbus?

 Buy your ticket(s) a day or two before your trip. You don't have to do this, but it will make your trip easier and less stressful and it will help the bus driver keep to his schedule. You can buy tickets at any NMBS station (train station) in Belgium, or at the ticket window near the bus stop in a big city. You can also buy tickets at many newspaper and magazine shops.
 As a general rule, make sure you arrive at the bus stop at least 10 minutes before the bus driver is scheduled to pick you up. Don't forget to bring your ticket and any other items you might need.

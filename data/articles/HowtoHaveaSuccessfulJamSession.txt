 Jamming is meant to be fun, so you want to pick music that is fun for everyone to play and isn't too heavily focused on a single instrument.;
, It is a good idea to start simple and as you get more comfortable with more complicated progressions.
 As the jam progresses the percussion will build up in complexity and intensity bringing the entire band with it.
, There is no pressure involved.

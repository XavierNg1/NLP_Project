 Chinese cabbage is a long, cylindrical vegetable that comes in two types. These requires slightly different approaches:


Napa cabbage looks similar to a head of Romaine lettuce, with thin, tightly packed leaves.Bok choy has a long, thick white stem with several branches. The leaves are dark green and clustered at one end.
 Rinse the cabbage and remove any wilted leaves. If cutting bok choy, chop off and discard a small chunk from the base. This brownish area where the stem branches meet tends to be tough and unpleasant.









You do not need to chop the base off Napa cabbage.
 Whichever variety you are using, place the cabbage on a stable cutting board. Cut the cabbage through the center of the stem with a large, stainless steel knife.









Avoid carbon steel knives, which can leave black marks on the cabbage.
 When chopping any vegetable, the "claw" position will protect your fingers from cuts. Curl your fingertips inward, so your knuckles are nearest the knife blade.
 Cut across the width of each half to make cabbage pieces as thin or thick as you desire. Thin shreds of ⅛" (3 mm) are ideal for coleslaw or sauerkraut, but thicker slices are fine for soups, or if you have a dull knife.









Both the stem and leaves of napa cabbage and bok choy are edible.
 Some heads of bok choy have large, wide leaves. Cut these into more manageable pieces by slicing through the pile of leaves once or twice lengthwise.








The bok choy leaves may require less cooking time than the stems. Consider adding them 5–10 minutes after you start the stems.

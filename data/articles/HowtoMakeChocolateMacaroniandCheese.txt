 Fill a pot with water and place it on your stove top. Pour the macaroni or elbows into the pot and cook per packaged directions until soft enough to eat. When the pasta has finished cooking, drain it in a colander.;
,, In a large bowl, combine the Mascarpone cheese, cocoa powder, almond extract, and egg yolks. Do not add the egg whites. It is recommended to use a hand blender or electric mixer for faster and better results. Blend for 8 minutes, until the cheese mixture is a light brown and is creamy.
 Use a wooden spoon to combine the pasta with the cheese sauce together. Ensure you mix well. All the pasta should be covered with the chocolate cheese sauce.
 Use a whisk to beat the two ingredients together until it forms soft peaks that are white.
 Add macaroni mixture to the egg mixtures, not the other way around. Use a wooden to spoon to slowly combine the ingredients.
 Use melted butter for easy spreading. Salted butter is recommended for more flavor.
 Scrape all the macaroni and cheese out of the bowl and spread it in your casserole dish using the wooden spoon. Then add the chopped almonds. Sprinkle the chopped almonds over the macaroni, all around so every part can have the full flavour.
 Cover the casserole dish with aluminum foil to prevent the dessert from burning too quickly. Place the casserole dish in the oven and have it bake for 20 minutes or until lightly crisped.
 Do not slice the chocolate macaroni and cheese when it is hot or you will end up with a chocolate gooey mess. Have it cool for a few minutes so the pasta and cheese can set slightly.
 Slice a piece of your chocolate macaroni and cheese and serve it on a dessert plate or in a bowl. Add the melted chocolate and spread all over your serving. Pour yourself a cup of cold milk. Enjoy!

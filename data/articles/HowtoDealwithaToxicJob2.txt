 In a toxic workplace, it is easy to become the person who does everything. You may feel as though you have to take complete responsibility for a task so that it gets done, or you may feel pressured to always say yes to your boss and coworkers when they ask you to do something. Put your foot down, and assert your boundaries.



Learn to say “no.” Do not agree to do something unless you are willing and able to take it on. You can say, “I know you want to take next week off, but I can’t cover for you during that time. I have my own work to complete. Sorry, but maybe you can find someone else.”
You may also want to establish when you are and are not available for work calls. You should make it clear to your coworkers and boss when you can be called during non-work hours., If there a particular coworker who causes problems, you should try to avoid them as much as possible. Only interact with them when you have to do, and keep it strictly professional. You do not have eat lunch with them, carpool, or chat together if you do not want to., It can be tempting to vent about your boss or colleagues to your coworkers, but this is generally a bad idea. Not only does it contribute to the toxic atmosphere of the workplace, but it can also get you in trouble, especially if the other person decides to complain. Do not risk your job. Avoid talking about coworkers behind their backs., A great way to inject some positivity into your workplace is to compliment others when they have done well. This can help ease the tension, and the happiness may spread throughout the workplace. Aim for at least compliment or positive reinforcement a day.For example, if a coworker has responded quickly to a request, you can say, “Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. I knew I could rely on you.”
You should also compliment your boss in a productive way. You can say, “Thanks, Joe. I know it is a stressful time of year, but your efforts really help us all stay productive.”

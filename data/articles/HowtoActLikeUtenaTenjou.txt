 Utena lost her parents and had to go through many hardships, but still manages to smile, and keep going. If you're always the type to cry, or whine, then toughen up and cut it to a minimum. Try not to care what others think, and do your own thing. It's not like it's not okay to cry; just stop worrying about little things.;
, While you may continue to act and dress like a girl, don't be afraid to get yourself dirty. If you're gonna play, play hard! Don't let guys scare you or, like Utena, be one of the guys.
 Just like she fights for Anthy Himemiya, the rose bride, you, too, must fight for the things that are right, and what you believe in. Don't be afraid to get your word out.
 Yes, you are trying to capture the essence of Utena by being her, but that doesn't mean you still can't be yourself. Do things because you feel like doing them (remember, Utena was the only girl to wear the boys uniform, simply because she said, "It suits me better; I like it.").
 Tomboy Utena tenjou acted like a man, but still had a feminine side, and got playboy Akio (and, unintentionally, Touga). Don't chase after them. Instead, use your natural grace and charm. Be strong, but don't come across too strong.
 If you really want, you could try dyeing your hair pink.
 Utena is a trusting (sometimes too much), loving girl. She isn't a liar either, so don't lie. Remember to do the right thing, even if it's the hardest thing to do.
 Yes, Utena was good at almost every sport. Join an afterschool sport. Who knows? You might find that you're really good at it.
 Depending which version you like, grow your hair out (anime) or cut it short (movie).
 Hey, even Utena had to draw the line sometimes. Learn to defend yourself (both physically, and verbally) and not only will you feel good about yourself, but you'll probably be admired for it, too.
 Utena wanted to be the prince that never came for her, so she tried her best to be one. Try your best all the time. Never give up!

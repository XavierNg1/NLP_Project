 Hoeing weeds is an important part of managing flowerbeds, vegetable gardens, and fields. You should always hoe weeds at first sight. Waiting until the weeds take over your garden will make hoeing more difficult., The best time to hoe is when the soil in your field or garden is as dry as possible. This creates what some gardeners refer to as dust mulch, which can help prevent new weeds from germinating. Try hoeing your garden early in the morning, before you water the plants., Before you begin to hoe, stand tall. Pick up the hoe by its handle and stand it on the ground beside you. Take notice of your upright position. Try to maintain as close to an upright position as possible while you hoe. This will make the process easier on your back., Grab the hoe and make sweeping motions over the tops of weeds, much like you would do if using a broom to sweep a floor. Make broad, fluid sweeping motions to slice the tops off the weeds., You should aim to sweep your hoe just below the surface of the soil. This will result in cutting off the tops of the weeds at this level, which can prevent future weed growth., It is important that you are precise and cautious while hoeing weeds. An accidental sweep to the right might result in an accidental chop to your favorite flowers. Make sure the hoe passes easily and precisely between the rows of plants, and does not disturb your flowers or crops.
 Hoeing weeds can be hard on your hands, arms, and back. Try to evenly distribute the labor on both sides of your body. You can easily do this by switching hands and arms frequently while hoeing.

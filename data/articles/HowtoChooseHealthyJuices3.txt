 If you have two juices with two different healthy qualities, feel free to combine them for a super-juice. There are endless combinations of healthy juices. For instance, mix cucumber juice with apple juice, or grapefruit juice with beet juice., If you’re worried that your healthy juice consumption is adding unwanted calories to your diet, drink a smaller portion of juice. Use a juice cup – a small cup that holds about eight fluid ounces – instead of a tall glass when drinking healthy juices., Another way to cut back on unwanted liquid calories is to mix water and healthy juices.Mixing a drink that is two parts healthy juice and one part water should be a good start. For instance, mix two cups of healthy juice and one cup of water in a pitcher, then pour yourself a serving equal to or less than that which you’d normally drink.Once you begin to lose your taste for juice, you could reduce the portion of juice in your beverage even further.
Try adding sparkling water for variety.
 If you make more healthy juice than you can consume at a time, bottle it. Place the excess healthy juice in the fridge and consume it within 24 hours.

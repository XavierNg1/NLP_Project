 There are online services which will convert your file, but it is difficult to verify the security of those sites. Apart from being a good converting tool, Adobe Acrobat also provides features for marking up documents. Adobe Acrobat Reader does cost money, but you can get around this by downloading a 30-day trial from this link: https://www.acrobat.com/en_us/free-trial-download.html?promoid=KQZBU#. Follow the steps to install the program.


You will need to enter in some information such as name, e-mail, and date of birth. Be sure to uncheck the option which notifies you through e-mail about new Adobe products and information. These e-mails can get annoying
If you do not want to sign up for an account, or if you have already used a 30 day trial, there are online services which convert your documents for free. Check out https://www.pdftoword.com/ or http://www.pdfonline.com/pdf-to-word-converter/ and follow the instructions on the page. Be aware that there are some security issues with using these online programs.

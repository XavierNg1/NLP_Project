 Your child should brush their teeth, and pick out a stim toy or comfort object to bring along. Help them find something they can hold in one hand; they can bring it to the dentist chair.

Don't rush your child. This will further stress them out. Try getting them started early, so they can move slowly if they need to.
 If your child is stressed, they may act differently, because they are struggling emotionally. Be gentle, and recognize that it isn't easy for your child.

Try doing something your child likes in the car. Bring the child's favorite music, talk about their special interests, or start a sing-along if your child likes singing.
Recognize that your child may need extra reassurance, or ask repetitive questions. This is due to stress.
 They may be able to make accommodations to help your child have a more pleasant visit., Your child may be afraid of you leaving them.

If your child has a lot of separation anxiety, ask if you could stay with your child the whole time. They may allow you to stay in the room while your child's teeth are cleaned.
 Tell them that they did a good job handling the dentist, and carry out the reward plan (such as watching a movie or buying a small toy). This will help your child feel better about how everything went.

If your child had a very hard time (crying, screaming, et cetera), tell them that courage isn't about lacking fear, but about facing their fear. So they truly did a good job: they went to the dentist, even though it was scary and difficult. Tell them you're proud of them.

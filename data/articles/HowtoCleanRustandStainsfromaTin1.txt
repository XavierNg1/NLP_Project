 These easy-to-find items can brush away small rust stains with ease. There's no reason to attempt more involved methods for lighter areas of rust when you can rub them away with common household items.;
, Vigorously scrub your tinware with one of these items using a back and forth motion. You need to put a decent amount of pressure on the tin to effectively clear away the rust.
 A grinder outfitted with a grinding wheel, stripping or flap disc can easily remove larger areas of rust. There are important factors to consider before using an electric sander.


Sanders, flap discs and fiber discs work best on long, flat patches of rust. In contrast, wire wheels are suggested for corners and curved areas.
Make sure the grinder is constantly moving so it doesn't puncture or wear away the tin. Consider using a mouse detail sander for smaller areas.
Always begin with the coarsest grain and carefully move to smaller grains as the rust wears away.
If there is significant scratching left on the tinware try using a fine grain sandpaper to smooth out any of the remaining marks.

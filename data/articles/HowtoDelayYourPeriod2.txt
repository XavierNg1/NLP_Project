 If you're going to be altering your existing birth control plan or workout routine, always talk to your doctor ahead of time. For instance, it's usually safe to manipulate how you take your birth control to delay your period. However, you should ask your doctor about occasionally delaying your period when you are prescribed birth control, and see if she thinks it's safe for you given your health and medical history.
 Delaying your period is not a means to guard against pregnancy. Unless you are on birth control pills or have a device like an IUD, you are not protected against pregnancy because you managed to miss or delay your menstrual period. Use protection (like condoms) and know the common signs of pregnancy. If you deliberately delay or miss a period, it may be harder to tell if you're pregnant as a missed period is usually the first sign. Pregnancy can also be marked by breast tenderness, fatigue, and nausea. Watch for signs of pregnancy and take a pregnancy test if you have any symptoms., Skipping the inactive pills if you're on a 28-day pack should not decrease the overall effectiveness of your existing birth control. However, birth control pills do not protect against STIs, so unless you and your partner have both been tested, you should still use condoms.

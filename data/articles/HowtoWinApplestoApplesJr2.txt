You should choose the card that best matches the meaning of that card in your mind., The person with the most cards at the end of the game is the winner. That means that if you forget to take your green card or drop it, then you will have fewer points at the end of the game.Remember to hang onto the green cards that you win and keep them in your sights at all times.

 "Selfies" (pictures you take of your self) are popular on Instagram — simply scroll through the "Explore" tab and odds are that you'll see plenty. However, unless you're a gorgeous celebrity, followers will often get annoyed if all they see on your profile is your face, so try to avoid posting too many pictures of yourself. A selfie or two is OK every once in a while, but doing it all the time can make you come across as vain or narcissistic, which can have a negative effect on your likes.


In this section, we'll give you a few tips for getting lots of likes with the selfies you do take. However, keep this first step in mind — no matter how good your selfies are, taking too many can be a very bad idea.
 Research has shown that certain color combinations make selfies statistically more popular on average. In particular, cool tones like blue and purple and earthy tones like tan, beige, burnt orange, and so on seem to do especially well. On the other hand, bright, "warm" colors like red, yellow, pink, and so on seem to be less popular on average. , Sometimes, the best selfies are ones that show you as you actually are. Posting a selfie without an obnoxious, overpowering filter can be a boost to your popularity if it helps convince others that you're not especially vain about your appearance. In fact, besides those with the "Willow" black-and-white filter, selfies with no filter at all have been found to be the most popular on average., You can sometimes get away with posting lots of selfies if the selfies themselves are shot in interesting ways. Playing around with the composition can help here — for instance, you might try to show off your amazing eyes by posting a close-up of your iris, or you might advertise the new lip gloss you're crazy about by posting a selfie that only captures your face from the nose down. It's up to you — there's no "right" way to take a creative selfie, so use your imagination!

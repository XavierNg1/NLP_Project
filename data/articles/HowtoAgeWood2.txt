 Allow time to set and then wipe off the excess. This will remove any previous color or stain from the wood, and enhance the natural grain and texture.
 This particular stain gives the appearance and color of wood that has been left for many years. If desired, this can be the final step.
 Combine your own unique combination of a color glaze, antiquing glaze, and mixing glaze. Be sure to use all three glazes from the same brand, so as to insure proper color mixing.
 Use a paintbrush to thoroughly coat the wood with the stain. There are multiple methods to do this:









Apply a single coat for a lighter look. This also can give the appearance of slightly newer wood.
Add multiple coats of stain to create a more worn look. This will also darken the wood, giving it a richer color.
Create “freckles” on your wood by flicking stain using a paintbrush or toothbrush. This will give irregular small spots of dark color on the wood.

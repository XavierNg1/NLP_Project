 You usually find them in "?" blocks while in Super Mario form, but you can also get them in Toad Houses. The Tanooki Suit also allows you to fly (and gives you the added ability of being able to turn into a statue), as does the P-Wing (which gives you infinite flight), but both are less common.;
, While running, you will see a meter on the bottom of the screen fill up. This is the Power Meter.
, You'll stop flying after flying for a bit of time (unless you're using the P-Wing to fly), hitting an enemy (and subsequently losing the Super Leaf, Tanooki Suit, or P-Wing power-up), or landing on solid ground.

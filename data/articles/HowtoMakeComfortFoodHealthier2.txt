 Another comfort food that is especially easy to crave is french fries. When this craving kicks in, go for baked sweet potato fries instead of classic fried french fries. This will significantly reduce the fat and overall calories of your snack.Slice a sweet potato into sticks or slivers and spread them on a baking sheet coating with coconut oil. Sprinkle a conservative amount of salt and any herbs you favor on top. Bake the fries at 375°F (191°C) for about 20 minutes.
Not only are sweet potatoes healthier than french fries, they make for a relatively healthy dessert as well. Use sweet instead of savory herbs, such as nutmeg and cinnamon.
 One of the less healthy components of pie is the crust; however, you can indulge in a pie filling-like custard if a pie craving hits. For instance, combine pureed pumpkin flesh with 1/2 cup low-fat milk, four eggs,2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 2 teaspoons pumpkin spice, and 1 teaspoon liquid stevia (try pumpkin-spice or vanilla flavored). Pour into six greased ramekins and bake at 350°F for 45 – 50 min. If you miss the crust terribly, sprinkle some crushed graham crackers on your serving to add a bit of crunch.
To make this and other recipes that call for eggs healthier, replace each whole egg with two egg whites.
 Dark chocolate — on its own or in a recipe — can be a great treat. Not only is it delicious, dark chocolate can provide you with healthy antioxidants, and has less fat and sugar. In fact, the darker the better. Go for an option that’s made of at least 70% cocoa.If cookies are on your minds, use dark chocolate chips. Further, use some quinoa flour and ground flaxseed, and replace some of the sugar in the recipe with a banana.

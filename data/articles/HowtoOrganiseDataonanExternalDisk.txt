 Create files for personal work, schoolwork/homework/projects/assignments and especially for presentations that you must give during meetings, speeches, ceremonies etc. This way you will find what you need when you need it, and quickly too.;
, Once again, make it obvious which files are to be used for any meeting that you attend. Always have a folder that you know off-by-heart to go to for presentation files. No mess, no fuss, no panic.
, Get out of the habit of simply loading information on to your memory stick and letting it go stale there. Sort regularly and remove the unneeded to free up space. Put things in their proper place for fast retrieval. And every now and then, wipe it clean when everything on it has stale dated.

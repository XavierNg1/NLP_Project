 There’s nothing that will interrupt the fun quite as quickly as a dud squirt gun. Accordingly, avoid the cheapest squirt guns, as they tend to break (not to mention leak). You don’t need to get the fanciest guns on the market, but look for options that feel solid to the touch and have triggers that are easy to pull.If you do go the dollar store route, be sure to get extra in case a few don't work out.
Generic options from large retailers are often just as good a name-brand options.;
, Depending on the age of your children and the specific activity you have planned, squirt guns that fire by way of a pump instead of trigger may be preferable. For instance, young children may struggle with a trigger, but be able to pump a small squirt gun.Whether trigger or pump-powered, simple pistol-style guns will be sufficient for most projects.
 The reservoir that will hold the liquid paint is important for two reasons. Second, the reservoir closure is a good indication of the quality of the gun.


Smaller reservoirs, of course, will be better for stationary art projects, in part because the guns will be lighter and easier for children to aim.
Be sure to check the seal on the reservoir's closure. Cheap plastic plug closures are unreliable, and indicate that the toy is low quality in general. That said, these may work fine for a one-time project or party, especially if you get extra.

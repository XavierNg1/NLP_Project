 You can buy whichever type of grape you want.;
, Look for some grapes with a long green vine.



If the vine is less than 4 inches (10cm) in length, or black in color, then don't use it.



If it is brown, black, or, red, then it is rotten.
If it is bright green and shriveled up, it is too dried out.
 Put the the vine inside it.


In less than 2 days, it should look healthier.
In about 4 days, it should start growing little roots.
 Plant the grapevine in the soil once the roots have grown.


A disposable cup can be used in place of a planting pot.
 Keep it in a sunny location.
 Once the plant is too big for the pot, remove it from the small pot and move the plant to a sunny area outdoors or in a greenhouse.

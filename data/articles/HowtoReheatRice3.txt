 The baking dish should be oven safe and large enough to contain the rice without needing to press it down to squeeze it in.
 For a single portion, add about 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 ml) of water. For larger amounts of rice, add more water., Pour a splash of olive oil or any type of broth over the rice for an added boost of moisture and flavor. Stir the rice a little so the liquid evenly coats as much of it as possible., Make sure all the rice is broken up and evenly spread around the baking dish so that it all heats at the same speed., If a lid came with the baking dish you’re using, place that lid on top of the dish before putting it in the oven. If you don’t have a lid, just rip off a large sheet of aluminum foil and wrap it over the edges of the dish., If after 20 minutes you think the rice is still too dry, pull it out of the oven, sprinkle another tablespoon of water over the rice, and place the lid back on. Let the dish sit on the stovetop or a trivet and steam for about five minutes.

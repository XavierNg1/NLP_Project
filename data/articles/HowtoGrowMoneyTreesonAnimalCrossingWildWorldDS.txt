 This is required before starting the money process.


Purchase two shovels from Nook's.
Dig a hole into the ground and bury the other shovel that is in your inventory.
Wait overnight and dig the shovel up after 6 am.;
, Note that planting 99,999 bells in a hole will have a 99 percent chance of success. Each 10 percent down (88, 77, etc) will also be that rate of success.
 Depending on how many bells you planted will determine on the odds and waiting time of your money tree. Do other activities in Animal Crossing, such as fishing or do present trading with neighbors.
 Money trees are not continuously growing, like fruit trees in the game. If you wish to do this again, you must start from the beginning of planting the money.

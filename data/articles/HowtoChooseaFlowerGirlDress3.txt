 Talk to the parents of your flower girl about who will pay for the dress. If necessary explain that traditionally the flower girl’s parents will pay for the dress. Offer to pay for a more expensive dress if that dress is very important to you., Pick dresses in different price ranges so the flower girl’s parents have options that can fit their budget. Look in different types of stores -- children’s shops, bridal stores, department stores, and online -- to find things you like in different price ranges. Be sure to provide her parents with information about where they can find each dress you’ve selected.

Consider asking them how much they can spend if you’re comfortable doing so. That way you can focus on finding dresses in their price range.
 Don’t hide any costs for the dress or accessories. Tell her parents about additional costs for accessories you will want the flower girl to wear, including shoes, tights, sweaters or wraps. Ask them to buy those together with the dress so everything is together and ready before the wedding.Pay for any flowers, wreaths, baskets, and hair accessories yourself because these would be considered flower girl gifts.

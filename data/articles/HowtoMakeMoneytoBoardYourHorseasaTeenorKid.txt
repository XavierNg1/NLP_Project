 Every boarding barn has people who go on vacation, or people who'd love to take a break from mucking stalls every day. Or even just riding all the time. Set up a rate schedule, depending on how much care you are willing to do. Not only will you get a little bit of income, but you'll learn a lot about horse-ownership along the way.;
, Offer to pull manes, braid, polish hooves, etc. If you're boarding your horse in a show barn, you can probably find customers fairly easily. Braiding, especially, can be very profitable. In the higher up levels, itâ€™s not uncommon for people to pay up to 60 dollars for a well braided mane.
 Offer to haul hay, repair fence lines, organize the feed room, etc.
 in your neighborhood.
, There are so many parents who are looking for a good babysitter to come and take care of their young ones after school. People can pay big money for a good babysitter! You can also set a price per child for each hour! Just make it reasonable, otherwise you will never get a good job! (Example: $5.00 per child each hour)

, If your barn has horses that aren't being used currently, talk to the owner and ask if you could school horses for them. If it works, ask if you could school them for a small break in your boarding fee.
 Coaches often need help, especially if they have inexperienced riders in a lesson that need a leader. Learn how to lunge, especially- it can be very useful!

 You can use an upright steamer or a hand steamer, but try to find one that is durable and well-regarded. Check online reviews and shop around before purchasing.Steamers are a good all-purpose way to get wrinkles out of leather. They work for garments and shoes as well as larger items such as furniture.
 Set your steamer to a medium-low setting, and allow it heat fully. Test it out away from the leather before you apply any steam to the wrinkled item. Cold or barely-there steam would allow for quick condensation on your leather item, which create some damage.


Read over your steamer’s instructions and the manufacturer recommendations regarding heating times before you use the steamer on your leather.
 If you are steaming a leather garment, hang it vertically. The steam relaxes the leather, allowing the natural weight of the garment to pull the wrinkles down and out. Use a hanger or the rack of your standing steamer.


If your leather objects are too large to hang, do not worry. The steam will still relax the leather enough for the wrinkles to settle.
 Use the steamer to apply an even coat of steam over the wrinkled parts of your leather. If possible, get both the inside and the outside of the wrinkled areas. Be sure to hold the steamer four or so inches from the garment and only apply steam for a second or so at a time, moving over the garment in same fashion that you would with an iron.If the wrinkles aren’t relaxing on their own after steaming, gently pull them to help relax them further.
Do not apply too much steam at a time. This could damage the leather and possibly the seams of your piece.
If you notice any moisture condensing on your leather because of the steam, take a clean, dry cloth and gently blot off the excess moisture.

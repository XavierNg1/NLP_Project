 Following a healthy diet may also help to control acne and get rid of your blind pimple. Try to avoid foods that are sugary, salty, greasy, or processed. Instead, opt for a diet of healthy, low-glycemic foods to help improve your acne.For example, you might want to include:


Lean meats like turkey, chicken, canned tuna, and shrimp
Whole grains like brown rice, whole wheat pasta, and whole grain bread
Fruits such as cherries, strawberries, apples, oranges, and grapes
Vegetables such as broccoli, peppers, carrots, green beans, spinach, and cauliflower

, Frequently touching your face can also make acne worse. The oil, dirt, and germs on your hands and fingers can also cause acne. Do the best that you can to keep your hands away from your blind pimple.

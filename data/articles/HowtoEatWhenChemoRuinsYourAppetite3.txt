 If your appetite does not return or you are struggling to maintain a healthy weight, your doctor may recommend certain medications. Medications such as Megestrol acetate and steroids can help to improve your appetite and encourage weight gain. Other medications like Metoclopramide and Dronabinol can also help to stimulate your appetite.Your doctor may recommend that you get treatment for any symptoms of chemo that may make it difficult for you to eat, such as nausea, dry mouth, or depression. Treating these conditions can help to make eating easier and more appetizing.
 If you are struggling with how to eat healthy and regularly while undergoing chemo, you may set up an appointment with a registered dietitian. Speak to the dietitian about your eating issues and work together on an eating plan. The dietitian can also recommend certain foods and certain eating habits you can try.You can get a recommendation for a registered dietitian from your primary care doctor or through your cancer treatment center.
 Keep in touch with medical professionals and track your eating progress with them. You may try keeping a food journal to note how often you eat and what you eat. You can then show your doctor the journal and use it as a reference for your progress.


Your doctor may also suggest monthly check in appointments to ensure you are eating regularly while undergoing chemotherapy.

 For your appointment, you'll need a photocopy of your passport's first two and last two pages including ECR/Non-ECR page and page of observation. Print out these photocopies before your appointment so that you have the proper documentation with you. These extra photocopies will go into your file., The documents you'll have to bring to your appointment include your old passport, two forms of proof of your present address (utility bills, aadhaar, or voter ID), and proof of your employment status. If you don't have a job, you'll need to get your sponsorship declaration or your application for residential status.Remember to bring the confirmation that you originally printed out after paying for the PCC online.
 Visit the Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) or Regional Passport Office (RPO) on the day of your scheduled appointment. Once you get to the front desk, let them know that you made an appointment online and have all the documents that you need to get your PCC.If there are no issues with your application, you should be able to get the PCC on the same day.

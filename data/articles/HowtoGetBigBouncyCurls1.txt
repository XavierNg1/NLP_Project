 Plug your curling iron in and turn it on to a temperature equivalent to the thickness of your hair (the thicker it is, the higher the temperature). For big curls, use a curling iron at least 1” wide; the wider the barrel of the iron, the larger your curls will be. Give the iron at least 2-3 minutes to heat fully before attempting to curl your hair.;
, Hair must be totally dry before being curled with an iron, so use a blow-dryer if necessary to dry it out. Add in a heat-protectant spray or mousse to keep your hair glossy and prevent it from getting fried. If desired, you can also add in a curl-enhancing product to help create big, voluminous curls with your iron.
 Curling your hair is a timely process, and you will get the best results if you work in sections. Tie the upper ⅔ of your hair into a ponytail on the top of your head, and leave the bottom-most layer down. Brush out your hair to remove any knots and tangles to prepare it for curling.
 Take sections of hair about 1” wide and wrap them around the barrel of your curling iron, starting in the center (rather than the ends) of each strand. Hold the hair in place around the barrel of the iron for 5-10 seconds, and then release the curl. Repeat this process throughout the entire bottom layer of your hair.
 Let down half of the hair in your ponytail, and brush through it to prepare it for curling. Following the aforementioned instructions, wrap each 1” section of hair around the barrel starting from the center of the strand until all your hair has been curled. Finish up with the top layer once the middle section is completed.
 Turn your blow dryer onto the ‘cool’ setting and blast your hair with the cool air. The temperature will return to normal in your hair, helping to keep it in place for longer. To finish it off, flip your head upside down and mist all of your hair with hairspray. Flip your head back over and adjust your hair to your liking. You’re finished!

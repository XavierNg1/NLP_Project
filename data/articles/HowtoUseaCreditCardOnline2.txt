 Check that your credit report doesn’t contain any errors (such as accounts that you have closed), discrepancies (such as accounts you never opened), or other suspicious activity. Also, review your card statements or online account regularly to make sure that there are no charges that you didn’t make. Not only will this keep your credit report clear, it will also reveal if you have been a victim of fraud (such as a stolen card number).
 If you do encounter a confirmed or suspected instance where your credit card information has been stolen, don’t freak out. Call your bank or credit card issuer right away, and let them know what is going on. They will walk you through the next steps to report and deal with the fraud, which usually involves erasing any fraudulent charges, changing your credit card number, and monitoring your credit report for any future issues.


In almost all cases, you will only be liable for up to $50 of fraudulent charges, if anything at all.Banks and credit card issuers offer protection from liability, and most customers are not help responsible for any fraudulent charges at all.
Don’t be embarrassed if you are the victim of credit card fraud. Cyber criminals are clever, and online security is a constantly developing field., If your bank or credit card issuer does not already offer credit monitoring services after a case of fraud, make sure to do this yourself. Let the three major credit reporting agencies--Transunion, Experian, and Equifax--know that there has been a problem with your account.

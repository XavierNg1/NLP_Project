 You should also see your doctor if the itching develops into a rash with bumps or blisters on your belly and/or other areas of your body. If none of the over-the-counter lotions or home remedies work, it may be time to see your doctor.


You should also speak to your doctor if the itching on your belly gets worse, especially at night. With treatment, your itchy belly should go away once you have your baby. Many women also do not experience an itchy belly again after their first pregnancy.
 If the itching is unbearable, your doctor may prescribe a strong anti-itching cream. Pregnant women can use some steroid creams safely, based on their individual health needs; however, your doctor will likely only prescribe anti-itching creams if the itching is severe and other remedies are not working., Based on the severity of your itchy belly, your doctor may test you for other health conditions, such as PUPPP (pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy), PEP (polymorphic eruption of pregnancy), or intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). You should be treated for these conditions by your doctor right away to ensure they do not negatively affect your pregnancy.


It is not known what causes PUPPP, but the condition may be caused by an immune reaction, a genetic factor, or a family history risk. PUPPP is treated in the same way as a regular itchy pregnancy belly, using moisturizers and steroid creams. Once you have your baby, PUPPP usually fades away on its own.ICP is a rare condition that affects up to 1 percent of pregnant women.It is caused by issues with your liver and your gallbladder. Symptoms of ICP include itchy skin, a loss of appetite, mild to moderate nausea, and fatigue. Your itching may also feel worse at night. ICP is treated with soothing creams and lotions, anti-itching medication, and lifestyle and diet changes.

 Before you address your big sister’s annoying habits and mean words, take time to review your own actions. Whether you would like to admit it or not, you may not be completely blameless. Your sister may have started the fight, but your response might have prolonged the fight. Consider the following:


Did you do or say anything to provoke your sister?
Did you react out of anger?
Were your actions and words intentional or unintentional?, While it is tempting to “get even” with your sister, this often makes the situation worse. Instead of hurling insults back at your sister, put an end to the incident with a sincere response. If she continues to bother you, get up and walk away instead of resorting to physical violence.


Don’t let her words affect you. For example, you could say “Maggie, what a funny story. I’d forgotten about that. Thanks for sharing.”
Being the “bigger” person is always the best option. It will keep you out of trouble., When your sister hurts your feelings, don't react in anger. Instead, let her know how her actions hurt you. This is a great way to start a serious conversation with your sister about your relationship.


For example, you could say “Maggie, please don’t tease me in front of my friends. It really hurts me and makes me uncomfortable.”

, No matter how hard they try, some siblings just can’t get along. If this describes you and your big sister, limit the amount of time you spend together. Not only with this reduce the number of fights you have, but the distance might make you two appreciate each other more.


Spend your free time in separate parts of the house.
If you share a bathroom, pack your items into a tote and get ready in a different room.
If you share a bedroom, ask your parents if you can sleep somewhere else.

 This is a free Excel macro that converts .vcf files into .xls format. This allows you to easily edit .vcf files with multiple entries. You can download it from sourceforge.net/projects/vcf-to-xls/. You will need to unzip the file before you can use it.
 Disable "Protected Mode" by clicking the "Enable Editing" button. Enable macros when prompted as well.
 The file will be converted, and will then be opened in a new Excel workbook.
 You will be able to see each entry in the .vcf file on each row, with all of the available information in each column. You can edit any information that you want.
 Once you're done making changes, export it as a .csv file, which can be read by nearly any contacts program.


Click the File menu and select "Export".
Click "Change File Type" and then select "CSV (Comma delimited)".
Name the file and save it.
 You can import a .csv file like you would a .vcf file in most cases. Select ".csv" or "CSV" if prompted.

 Scaly mites (Cnemidocoptes pilae) cause your bird to develop crusty patches.These can appear on your budgie’s beak or toes, even the eyelids, cere, vent and wing tips.
 An overgrown beak is another possible sign that your budgie has mites (such as Cnemidocoptes pilae).An afflicted budgie’s beak may grow abnormally long, or appear deformed.
 Using spot on medications eliminate mites that cause crusty growths on budgies. However, you should contact a vet for specific recommendations and instructions.Treatments may include:


Xeno (an insecticide). It is applied to your budgie’s feathers in drops or by using a pipette. Several doses at two week intervals should eliminate your bird’s mites.
Insecticide dusting treatments.
Thoroughly cleaning your bird’s cage.

 You should only use food grade plastic buckets or glass carboys as your fermentation vessel. Make sure that the lid is food grade as well. A 7.5 gallon (28 L) vessel will allow for 5.5 to 6 gallon (21 to 23 L) batches. Keep in mind that you may occasionally need to stir the batch, so containers such as buckets are often ideal., You need about 1.5 to 2 gallons (5.7 to 7.6 L) worth of space in a 7.5 gallon (28 L) vessel. This allows room for the foam and gases that form during fermentation. If you don’t leave enough room, the pressure can build and pop the lid on the vessel, leading to contamination., You need to make a hole in the lid that is the right size for a rubber grommet and airlock. Push the grommet into the hole. Then fit the airlock into the top of the grommet. Install a rubber gasket around the lip of the lid to form an airtight seal between the lid and the container., The fermentation vessel (and rubber stopper for glass vessels or lid for a plastic bucket), airlock, and a large spoon should be cleaned and sanitized. Fill the fermentation vessel to the brim with a sanitizer, such as iodophor, that is made for brewing and winemaking. All these items are available at homebrewing and wine-making shops.

 This can cost you as little as $5. While the idea of a grapple is simple, the construction requires knowledge of metal working, forging and welding. The hooks must be capable of bearing at least your weight. You need to attach the hooks together such that whichever hook bites, it as strong as any other. You need to create a loop or ring to attach a rope that is also strong enough to bear your weight. You will need the following:


3 feet of 5/16" round steel rod ($5.00 Canadian at Home Depot)
Hacksaw
Clamps or magnets (to secure the pieces while welding)
A welding mask, gloves and appropriate clothing
Welder
A grinder of some sort
A length of sturdy rope
Eye protection

,, Make two 90° bends about 1.5" apart, forming a "U" shape on one end of the shaft. Use a vice to "pinch" the two straight legs of the "U" together, forming a loop. Finally, bend the shaft at about a 45° angle so that it is centered over the loop.
, Cut a 5" piece of 5/16" round steel rod, and use the grinder to sharpen one end of the 5" piece into a dull point.
 Repeat this step until you have 4 hooks.
 Place the first 2 hooks on either side of the shaft, near the top. Weld them in place. Then flip the grappling hook over and make matching welds on the other side.
 Weld it in place on both the left and right sides of the hook.
 Use the magnet to secure the 4th and final hook to the shaft perpendicular to the first 2 hooks you welded. The hook should also be in line with the hook you welded just before this one (the 3rd hook). Weld it in place on both the left and right sides of the hook.
 If you want, you can spray paint it.

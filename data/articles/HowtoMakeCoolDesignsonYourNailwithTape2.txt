 It can be diagonal or horizontal, but press it down hard so none of the nail polish leaks.;
, No specific color, just the color you love. and it's ok if you get nail polish on the tape.
, I would not recommend using tape for this, because there is a risk of the tape puling the nail polish off. I use freehand for this part, because it still looks nice.

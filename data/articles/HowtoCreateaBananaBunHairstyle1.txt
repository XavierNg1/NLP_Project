 You want to have two side sections and a back, center section. This style works best on slightly dirty hair.It does not matter if you have curly, wavy, or straight hair.If you hair is freshly washed or very smooth, consider spraying it with some dry shampoo or texturizing spray. This will help give it some texture and make styling easier.;
, Keep the hair tie low, about the middle of your hair.
 Twist the strand a little as you cross it so that it is more like a rope. You want the strand to be just above the hair tie, or covering it.
 Keeping a hold on the right strand, pull it under the old middle strand (the strand currently on the right). You want the tail end of the strand to be pointing to the right.
 Once again, give the left strand a twist as you cross it so that it becomes more like a rope. You want to finish with the tail end of the left strand pointing to the right as well.
 You can use bobby pins or U-shaped pins.How many pins you use depends on how long, thick, and heavy your hair is.
 This really depends on how you want your bun to look like in the end. For a messier look, leave the tail ends of the strands hanging down. For a cleaner look, tuck the tail ends under the bun and pin them into place. If you have very long hair, you may need to wrap them around the bun a few times first.
 Gently loosen a few strands of hair from around you hair line. This will help give your bun a more relaxed and natural look.If you want to help your style last longer, mist your bun with some hairspray.

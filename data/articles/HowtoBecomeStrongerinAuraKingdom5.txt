 The Envoy’s Path system works by making you choose some stat bonuses and skills from a “map,” sort of like a modified version of the skill trees normally used in games. You can access it from the Character menu, which you can access by either clicking “C” or by clicking on the helmeted icon on the lower part of your screen, then clicking the Envoy's Path button.
 New bonuses and abilities can only be selected from squares directly adjacent to squares you have already unlocked as you levelled up, and the best abilities and the abilities for sub-weapons are available on the farthest sides of the map.
 To unlock a bonus, left-click on a darkened icon (and not the “locked” ones), then click “Confirm.” If you’re having second thoughts or made a mistake while selecting, as long as you haven’t clicked on “Confirm” yet, you can just click “Undo,” which will reset your choices. If you made the mistake of pressing “Confirm” as well, you can press “Reset,” but doing so will cost you quite a lot of money.

 They should be pretty easy. By the time you have 5 attack buy a steel sword for between 140-300gp.;
, If you happen to run out of shrimp, go back and fish or if you fished a lot get a full inventory of shrimp.
 Train on cows. Repeat this process until you have 20 attack. Buy a mithril scimitar, if you are not rich, pick up the cows' hide and tan them. Then, start training on monks, no food is required.Keep doing this until you have 30 attack. Buy any adamant weapon.
 Congrats you are now available to use rune weapons and dragon weapons.

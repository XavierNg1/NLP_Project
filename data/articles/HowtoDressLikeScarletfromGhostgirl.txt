 No I do not mean brand, I mean music bands. Scarlet has shirts with underground bands on them like Deathcab for Cutie, The Killers, and All Time Low. A good place to get these cheaply are online or thrift stores, but if you're willing to shell out some cash, you can go to the concerts as well.;
, They are cute and interesting and make your T-shirts from being obscene. you might also want to wear them just in case you spontaneously decide to go swimming with a hot popular seniorÂ ;).
 Remember the only color you wear is in your cami. But don't go overboard or punk e.g. ripping your clothes and pinning them with diaper pins or imitating Pink. Remember Scarlet's outfits are a mix of burlesque and dark wave. Burlesque does not mean slutty, it means sexy and ladylike to a point. Wear lacy camisoles, tight-fitting shirts, and ruffled skirts.
 cocktail rings are a must! Make them glittery and loud. Also wear crosses and intricate necklaces around your neck (a fairy pendant gold chain or an unusually braided silver necklace with a cross).
 If you want to wear foundation, choose the pale kind since the book mentions that Scarlet is naturally pale. A little bit of eyeshadow is okay, but don't go overboard you are not trying to be Bozo the clown.

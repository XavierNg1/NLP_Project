 Mating lions and lionesses are extremely aggressive. They are easily triggered during this time. There is no specific time of year that lions reproduce. However, it is very easy to know when lions are mating because when the lioness is in the heat, the couples mate up to 40 times a day. This lasts for several days., No matter how tempting it may be or how cute lion cubs are, you should never interact with a lion cub. Lionesses are ferociously protective of their young and should therefore be given extra space. Do not attempt to interact with it in any way, shape or form. In the event you encounter cubs, try to find a route to take you as far from them as possible to avoid an attack.
 Lions are predominantly nocturnal. This is when they do a substantial amount of their hunting. If they’re in predator mode, they are much more prone to attack. If you’re in an area of high lion density overnight, maintain a night watch so that you aren’t caught off-guard.

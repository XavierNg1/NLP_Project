Reflections on shiny dark wood can be as eye-catching as boats reflecting in water, or as distracting. The shinier the surface, the more distinct and brighter your reflections. Black glass tables can give mirror accuracy with hard edges but reduce the highlights dramatically. If you can get the lighting just right, glass objects on a regular mirror can create a wonderful maze for the eye to wander.
Introduce colored or dark backgrounds to show off the clarity of the glass. Don't make them too busy like a paisley cloth unless you're either letting them go out of focus or looking at how the glass distorts patterns - larger bolder patterns distort more dramatically if you're doing that for your setup.
Wind a soft silk scarf through the setup to provide a contrasting texture. It can also be placed or piled up strategically to reduce an unwanted highlight.
 This will give you the needed control that you need to improve your photos., This will help with the lighting and background.

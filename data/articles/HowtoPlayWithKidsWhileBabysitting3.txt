 This is a job and the parents are your employers. Wear clothing that is modest, clean, and appropriate for the activities you will be doing with the children.
 Tell the kid that it is a special spray that will shoo away the monsters and get the kid to spray the water across the room. Make sure that the water bottle setting is on mist. If you can't use the spray bottle for some reason, take some glitter with you to the babysitting job and claim that it is pixie dust and if you sprinkle it over their favourite stuffed animal/doll/toy, then the stuffed animal/doll/toy will keep all of the monsters away. Just make sure that you clean up the glitter after you sprinkle it on the stuffed animal/doll/toy.
 For example, build something out of soft blocks or small square sponges and let them knock it down. You could also get them to build something out of Play-Doh or putty and then let them crush it. You'll keep the kids happy for hours playing like that.

Qualified Retired Persons Program
Citizenship;
, If you have family members who are Belizean citizens, you may qualify to apply for citizenship by descent before you move to Belize.


Citizenship is granted to individuals born in Belize and to the children and grandchildren of citizens of Belize.
Your Belizean parent or grandparent does not need to be alive at the time of your application for you to receive citizenship, but you will need to be able to prove that they were legal Belizean citizens.
 If you marry a citizen of Belize, you are eligible to become a Belizean citizen as well. Belizean citizens can file for citizenship for their foreign born spouses as soon as their marriage is legalized.Marriages are investigated to make sure they are not fraudulent immigration scams.
All children from this marriage are automatically eligible to become Belizean citizens, whether they are born in Belize or in another nation.
 If you do not qualify for citizenship through marriage or descent, you will need to go through the citizenship application process. This is a long-term process that has a specific set of requirements that must be met.


Belize requires the applicant to have lived in Belize as a permanent resident for a minimum of 5 years before they can apply for citizenship.
The citizenship application is usually processed within 6 months, but may take up to a year, or more., When you decide to move to Belize, you will first need to obtain a tourist visa to remain in the country for over 30 days. If you have received citizenship status through marriage or descent, this is not applicable to your situation.


All visitors, besides cruise ship passengers, must present a valid passport before entering the country. Your passport must not expire within three months of your arrival date.
You can stay in Belize for up to one month without a visa.
If you decide to stay longer than a month, you must go to the Immigration Department in Belize City or Belmopan to receive a visa extension and to pay for a new tourist visa. All prospective Belizean residents must enter the country on a tourist visa until they have completed one year of residency.
 Tourist visas are intended for short stays, and can be extended up to one year. They do carry certain requirements and can be renewed.


Check to see if your current country of residence requires a specific Belize visa to enter Belize. There is a flat rate fee for a tourist visa that increases after the sixth month of your stay. If you are driving or boating into Belize from either Guatemala or Mexico, you will receive a temporary importation permit for your transportation. You cannot legally work in Belize with a tourist visa so ensure that you come to the country with enough funds to sustain yourself.
 Permanent residency is the first step in becoming a citizen in Belize if you are not the relative or spouse of a Belizean citizen. Applicants for permanent residency must live in Belize for one year prior to applying.


To become a permanent resident, you must first enter the country on a tourist visa. You will then apply for residency and renew your tourist visa every 30 to 90 days until your residency is denied or granted.

Once you receive residency, you will pay $62.50 USD for a residency card.

QRPs are considered non-residents for banking purposes so they can set up a bank account with a local or offshore bank in Belize.
QRP status is not the same as citizenship, it is a separate program that is akin to residency. , To receive nationality status (i.e. citizenship), you must become a permanent resident, and have been a legal resident of Belize for a minimum of five years. If you become a citizen through descent or marriage, these requirements will not apply to your case.

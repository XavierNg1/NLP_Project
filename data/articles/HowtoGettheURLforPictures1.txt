 You can get the address for most images you find online.;
, Some websites will display a thumbnail instead of the whole image. If you get the URL now, you'll only be getting the URL for the thumbnail. Make sure the full-size image is loaded in your browser.


For example, the images in this wikiHow article are actually thumbnails. To see the full-size version, you'd need to click the image to open the full-size version in a new window.
 Once you've found the image that you want to get the URL for, right-click on it if you're using a computer or press and hold on it if you're using a mobile device.


If you're using a Mac with a one-button mouse, hold Ctrl and click the image to open the right-click menu.
If you can't right-click the image, click here.
 The wording for this option will change depending on the browser you are using:Chrome (computer) - "Copy image address"
Chrome (mobile) - "Copy image URL"
Internet Explorer - "Copy"
Safari (iOS) - "Copy" (Note: This only works if the image is not a link. If the image is a link to another page, you cannot get the URL using Safari for iOS)
Safari (OS X) - "Copy image address"
Firefox - "Copy Image Location"

, Once you've copied the image URL, it will be copied to your device's clipboard. You can then paste it anywhere you'd like, such as a message, document, or a browser's address bar. If you copy something else before pasting it, the copied URL will be overwritten with whatever you copied last.

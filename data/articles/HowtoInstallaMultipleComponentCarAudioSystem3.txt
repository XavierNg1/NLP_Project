 This is crucial to achieve perfect precision with 4, 6, and 8 or more sub woofers.


An amp that is rated at 1000w RMS (Root Mean Square, or the average watt the speaker is intended to receive and play with) set for 1 ohm can power two 2-ohm subs rated at 500w RMS.
That same amp can power four 4ohm subs and so forth. But the more subs an amp is placed on, the less power it can give to each individual sub. This is not necessarily a bad thing if you have a 2000w RMS amp and two 600w RMS subs. In fact, you always want the power from the amp to be slightly higher than what the sub(s) requires; a 1000w amp will work well with a 7 or 800W RMS sub.
Just make sure that the sub's peak power is rated above 1000w. If rated under, make sure your amp's level is not too high as you can damage the sub.
If you have a really powerful amp that's 3000w RMS or higher, then you can really power multiple subs at once without any problem. Just make sure the subs donâ€™t combine to read at 0.5 ohm (a dangerous level for an amp, unless it specifies that it can run at that low ohm level) and all your wires are properly connected and wired.
 However, depending on whether you wish to connect them in series or parallel or bridge the amp, you may only use two terminals. Refer to your amp's diagram for more specifics.

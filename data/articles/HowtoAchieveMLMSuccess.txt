If you're working online, you will need a website or personal blog. This site will be about you, your MLM business and what you have to offer.

While that sounds like a recruiting tactic, the reason it’s important is that anyone who succeeds in MLM, does so with a strong team.

If you can bring these people with you, it eliminates the need to find them later and can really speed up the growth of your business. It’s also much easier to work though advanced MLM Training courses and develop marketing plans with a friend or peer.


It’s a little more difficult to find a good mentor but if you reviewed enough of the MLM training programs out there you probably encountered someone you would like to work with.

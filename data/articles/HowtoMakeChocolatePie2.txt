 Place a piece of tin foil or parchment paper against the crust and weigh it down with some dried beans. Cook the crust in a preheated 350 F (177 C) oven for 15 minutes, then for an additional five minutes without the beans and foil.Remove the crust and allow it to cool.
Turn the oven down to 325 F (163 C).
 First combine the dry ingredients. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, cocoa, flour, and salt. Then add the milk and switch to using electric beaters. Beat the mixture until combined.Add the eggs one at a time, incorporating each one into the mixture before adding another.
Finally, add the butter and vanilla. Beat the mixture for two to three minutes, until everything is smooth and all the ingredients have been incorporated.
 Use a spoon to get all the filling out of the bowl. Spread the filling around evenly in the pie shell.


Place the pie into the oven and bake for one hour.
 After an hour, remove the pie from the oven and place it on a cooling rack. Let the pie sit and cool for another hour before serving. This will give the filling time to set properly.

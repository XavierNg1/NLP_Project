 If your meningitis is caused by bacteria, your doctor will start you on antibiotics. Often, you will stay in the hospital and antibiotics will be given by IV. Oral antibiotics may not be strong enough or fast-acting enough to treat bacterial meningitis appropriately.


Your doctor may start you on “broad-spectrum” antibiotics immediately, even while waiting to see what bacteria grows from your spinal tap. These are antibiotics that fight a wide range of bacteria. Then once results return, your antibiotics may be changed to specifically target the appropriate bacteria causing your illness.
You may also get treated with corticosteroids to minimize the chance of complications like seizures and brain swelling.;
, Most cases of meningitis come from viruses, not bacteria. Viral meningitis is usually less severe than bacterial meningitis. It usually requires no treatment and should clear on its own.Stay home from work or school, get plenty of rest, drink fluids, and allow the illness to pass.


Over-the-counter pain medication can help to temporarily relieve uncomfortable symptoms.Your doctor may want to give you a course of steroid treatment to prevent brain swelling, and maybe anticonvulsants to prevent seizures.
If the herpes virus is causing your meningitis, you may be prescribed an antiviral medication.
 Chronic meningitis – when symptoms develop over a course of 2 weeks or longer – occurs when a slow-growing organism, like fungus, causes the infection. This requires hospitalization and treatment with antifungal medications. The symptoms are similar to bacterial meningitis, so seek care and diagnosis when you have any meningitis symptoms., If someone around you has meningitis, your doctor may recommend that you take antibiotics as a prophylactic, or preventative, measure. This can help keep you from getting the illness, especially if you live with someone who is sick or you have a weakened immune system. Discuss this option with your doctor.

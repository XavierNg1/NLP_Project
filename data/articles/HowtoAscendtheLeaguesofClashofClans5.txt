 Farming requires sacrifice and patience. The game is not meant to be completed in a short amount of time, it is one that you can go back to over a long period of time.
 Make a general plan of what you are going to upgrade, how you will get the resources, and when you will do them. Stick to the goal.


Ask clan-mates their thoughts on it, and be willing to change your plan if they offer a better one
Recognize and remember that the best players did not rush the game; they took their time, played a lot, and have a ton of experience.

 When you take a break from Atkins, you upset the fat-burning process and go back to burning carbs for energy. To effectively continue lipolysis, you need to consistently eat low-carb.
 You may use low-carb bars or shakes for occasional snacks, but the Atkins diet should be primarily based on whole foods.
 Just because you’re not counting calories doesn’t mean that you have a license to eat as much as you want.
 Use enough mayonnaise when you make chicken salad to hold the mixture together without making it too dry. Drizzle your vegetables with olive oil; don’t pour olive oil on them.
 Avoid pigging out on red meat or bacon. Instead, eat plenty of chicken, fish and soy in addition to occasional servings of red meat.
 Write about what you tried to do and why you didn’t succeed. Also, keep a food journal so that you are holding yourself accountable for every bite that you eat.
 Try some of these:



Stretch your quads (quadriceps).

Perform the cobra pose for your back.

Stretch your hamstrings.

Stretch your back.
 Clothing should breathe and fit properly. Shoes should provide your feet with proper support and cushioning. For women, a supportive bra is a must.

 The cap is the top of the pen covering the “grip section,” where you hold the pen, and the “nib,” which is the part where the ink comes out.;
, The barrel is the cover housing the body of the pen, where the ink is held. The most common modern pens will require this step. Older and rarer pens will have self-filling mechanisms that do not require removing the barrel.


Instead of a barrel cover, built-in piston or button systems may have a “blind cap” over the screw knob or button.
 If you aren’t sure what kind of method to follow, examine the inside of your pen. Most likely you will have a plastic cartridge, or a piston converter system with a plunger, or a squeeze filler converter system that has a long button on the side of the pen.

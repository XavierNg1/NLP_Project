 Red popsicles contain artificial food coloring that will stain your lips red, just like lipstick. Choose the brightest red popsicles you can find. Look for flavors like cherry, red raspberry or strawberry.You can use any food product with red dye. If you don't have popsicles available, look for red soda.
You can also use red food coloring, the kind used in baked goods. This is highly pigmented and will stain your lips for hours, so be careful.
 You'll apply the melted popsicle to your lips just like you would fruit juice. If you'd prefer, you can eat the popsicle and let it stain your lips red, but it may end up looking a little messy.
 Rub it over your lips to coat them, making sure to stay within your lip lines. Let the liquid dry on your lips.
 Every layer you apply will make your lips look redder, so apply as many coats as you want. Let each one dry for a moment before applying the next.
 This will prevent your stain from rubbing off and give your lips a pretty shine.

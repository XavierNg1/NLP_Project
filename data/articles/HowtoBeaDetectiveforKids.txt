 Try to get somewhere between 1-4 people; in case you need help they will always be there for you.;
, Some ideas are:


Someone's lost or stolen item.
A mysterious note.
A suspicious person or a group.
 Analyze the case with your team but don't be too bossy. You should work together as a team.
, Don't accuse anyone without a good amount of evidence or you could get in super big trouble.

 If you want to make your attempts to ignore your guy a little subtler, one great option is to wait a few days to agree to hang out. If he wants to go meet up outside of school, you can let him know that you are interested, but that you need to figure out when you're available.


When he asks you to hang out, let him know that you have to get back to him.
Wait anywhere from one to three days to confirm.
 If the guy you like wants to spend time with you, make him work around your schedule. Don’t change your life to accommodate him. This is an excellent way to play hard to get and ignore your guy in a subtle way.In order for this to work, you've got to stay busy.
Fill your time with regular activities, such as a weekly date to do your nails with your friends or weekly trips to the bookstore to look at new books.
 Another effective way to ignore your guy is to pay some attention to somebody else. Making your guy a little bit jealous can be an excellent way to remind him how much he values you, and push him to give you the attention you deserve.You can make him jealous by texting or writing notes to someone else.
Another method is just to let him see you talking and having fun with others.
Be careful not to take this too far. You only want to make him a little bit jealous, not drive him away.
 If you are already going out with this guy, but he isn’t treating you the way you would like, you may want to drop some hints that you’re looking for the door. If he really cares about you, he will step up and make sure you stay.Talk about your plans for the summer (as if they do not include him).
Perhaps you are thinking about going away to a summer camp, or on a long road trip with family.
When you talk about the future (like where you will attend high school or college), try dropping a line like, “Well, we don’t really know what is going to happen with us.”

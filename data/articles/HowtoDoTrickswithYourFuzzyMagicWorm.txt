 They come with the names "wriggly magic worm" and "twisty worm". They come in colors like green, blue, light blue, purple, red, orange,Â and pink.


Check online if you can't make it to the stores to buy one.
 Twist all the way until it is fully extended.;
,, The worm will start to follow you.


To make it even funnier, pretend you don't know its there, and when turning to see, move your fist so that it goes behind you. This works best on younger children. If you want, try with a younger sibling first.
 You will need to extend the worm to about 12 inches and put it under a pillow.
,


To make it go back, pretend to view the back of the cave and move your hand with you, therefore pulling it back.
 Choose a cylinder, from a pencil to an oven handle, and wrap it around three to five times.



To make it do a little extra, with more "pizazz", wrap it on a chair with bars on the back, and do it any pattern you want.
, Find two flat surfaces that are slightly shorter than the full length of the string.
 The magic fuzzy worm will fly through the air and land right in front of you.


To make this more believable, stretch your hand out, say, "come here wormie" and then pull to put your hand back in place.
 Put it on the ground at full length or long enough so that it is on the ground and when you pull all it does is moves its head.
, Stop occasionally for sniffs, and continue.


To make this more believable, light a scented candle or make a scent and then start the action!

, Any cool tricks that you think you would like? You can even get some friends and start a live "magic wormie" comedy show, charging a charity fee of 50 cents per person!


Make it funny: Is the wormie your friend, your enemy, does it spy on you, does it hide on you? Introduce some comedy to the performance.

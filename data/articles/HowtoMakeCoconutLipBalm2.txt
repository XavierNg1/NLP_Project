 Some good flavors/colors to try are strawberry, pink lemonade, tropical punch, cherry.


You can mix flavors if you would like to create your own color.
 You will probably need to add a little more later but this amount is so that you can see the color.


If you want, add in a different color so it is closer to the color you want to achieve.
 The Kool-Aid itself will be very sour so it does taste better if you add a little sugar. Roughly 1 or 2 spoons should be enough.
 Try to crush all of the sugar and Kool-Aid. If you miss a little that's okay, but if you miss a lot of the sugar grains, the final product will look grainy on your lips.
, Microwave it for a few seconds to melt it. Remove from the oven.



Use a container that has been thoroughly cleaned and sterilized beforehand.
 The oil and Kool-Aid paste don't blend very well, so it takes lots of stirring. Watch some TV or listen to a podcast while doing this.
 Let it chill for 2 minutes. This will help the coconut oil re-solidify so that it won't be a liquid.
 That will probably require about three rounds of mixing and chilling, but it depends on how much your stirring it and how cold the fridge is.
 Once it is thickened, just leave it in the fridge for 30 minutes to set completely.

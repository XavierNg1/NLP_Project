 Your time and talents are a great resource. There are several non-for-profit organizations, like Human Rights Watch or Global March Against Child Labour, who depend on volunteer help to defend, uphold, and advance human rights.Local chapters especially need volunteers to help in the day-to-day running of the organization. For a listing of local chapters, look here.
Reach out to your local chapter through their website or email. They will have more information and specific people to contact on their websites as well as more ways for you to get involved.
Offer to help run specific outreach programs or events in your area.
Offer to be in international ambassador. If you're interested in helping beyond your local level, volunteer to go abroad and help in those countries most plagued by child labor injustices.
 Organizations strive to influence policy makers and increase awareness through petitions. Through a little online research, you can find open petitions for local and global child labor issues.
 Supporting organizations and their efforts through a financial donation is another way to make a difference.


Many organizations sponsor public aid programs, collect funds for better schools, and offer financial services for children and their families; often, you can donate directly to these initiatives and individual programs.
Be sure to make contributions through reputed organizations so that your donated dollars really count and go where you want them.
If you chose to donate clothing, toys, or books, make sure these items are Fair Trade certified and haven't been produced through sweatshops or child labor.

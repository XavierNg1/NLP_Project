 You can purchase a powdered worm food from a bait supply store or make your own worm food by blending fruit and veggie scraps, coffee grounds, or eggshells. To feed the worms, sprinkle a light layer the worm food over the top of the worm box. Wait until all of the food has been eaten before feeding them again.Don’t mix the food into the soil. This can harm your worms.
Avoid feeding your worms citrus fruits, spicy food, meat and dairy products, bread, and oil.
 Place the worms in a covered container, taking care to keep the majority of the soil in the worm box. Either take the worms fishing immediately or store them in the refrigerator for up to a week.


Discard any leftover worms from your fishing trip by releasing them into a shady section of your garden.
Harvest worms before feeding them to avoid mixing the food into the soil., If you don’t, the worms will get sick and die. Remove all of the worms from the worm box into a bucket. Next, scoop out all of the old soil or bedding and replace it with new moist soil. Once you’ve finished, dump the worms back into the worm box.Wait for the worms to reintegrate into the soil before feeding them again.
The old dirt can be used as a fertilizer in your garden.

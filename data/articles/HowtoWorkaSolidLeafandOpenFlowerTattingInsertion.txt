 Each of the six leaves forming a circle is composed of 4 double, 2 purl, separated by 2 double, 4 double (the first and last purl of each leaf must be joined in the manner before explained), and the centre of each circle forms a wheel.;
, The flower has four leaves. Each leaf consists of 6 double, II purl, separated each by 1 double, and again 6 double; each leaf is filled up with button-hole stitches in fine cotton.
 Turn several times the thread which joins the leaves, and work button-hole stitches round it.
 Do this by knotting them together, or by making 1 purl longer than the others, and by drawing the next figure through.
 The crochet border on each side of the tatting consists of six rows, which are plainly seen in the illustration.

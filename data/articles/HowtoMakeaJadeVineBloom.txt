 Jade vines like the full sun and the sturdy support for their vines.;
, The vines quickly mature if you prune them every three months or so. Blooms come right after pruning a new shoot of purple leaves on a mature vine no less than 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick.
 Don't let your coffee grounds go to waste! Dump them at the base of the vine. The coffee will add acidity to the soil. acidic soil will encourage the jade vine to give more blooms.
 They are attracted to the purple shoots and the tips of the new bloom.


Only bats and wasps can pollinate the jade vine.

 If you are in the T terminal, you need not worry about taking the Plane Train, as you'll have arrived in the center court of this Terminal building. For others, you'll need to look up at the boards in the Atrium portion as you enter to see for gate assignments. Although your ticket gives you some of the information, the most-up-to-date data is available on these screens or your airline's app., You'll need to pass through both the main and north/south checkpoints to be able to go any further. If you flight takes off from the T terminal, you don't have to go walk too far past the security checkpoint, as your terminal is on either side of the main checkpoint. It's best to walk through either the North or South security checkpoints to get to your gate, and you won't have to travel on the Plane Train at all., Stand aside if there are people trying to rush by.

If you need to use an elevator, look for signs sending you to the elevator. The signs may be overhead or around the opposite escalator so look accordingly.


Plane Trains come every minute or two, so if it's not right there, it will arrive soon.
 Walk quickly into the train, but don't run - even if there aren't any people on the train., Don't push or barge into people; slowly make your way to a safety spot., There are no physical seats on these trains. Hang onto the hanger bars as the train moves. Although the train moves forward, it will feel like you are moving sideways from terminal-to-terminal., Don't try to exit the train with the mob of people if people try to barge through or around you. Move carefully around people and out of the train.

When you arrive at your terminal, head down the hallways and up the escalators to find your gate.

 The water temperature should be warm, but not hot nor cold. Make sure the water is at least halfway full unless your dog is really little then only use as much water as is safe.;
, Try to keep him/her in their for as long as possible. You can attach him/her to a leash and tie it somewhere.
 Rub it all over your dog. Rub it behind the ears, the neck, the stomach and even the tail!

, Make sure all the shampoo is gone.
 The body wash should be in a bottle, not a bar. Soak it in hard so you get to his skin. The stomach should be easiest.
 Â Do the same with the conditioner as you did with the shampoo.
 Now your dog will be squeaky clean!

 On ethnic skin, it just looks unrealistic and makes darker skin look dry. Just focus on getting your skin even and clear, apply foundation that matches your tone and covers any imperfections.;
, Even though ethnic goths can't really make skin paler, it would help to avoid wearing any blush or bronzer. But if you want your face to have a more sculpted look, only apply bronzer to hollows of cheeks.
 Darker ethnic skin can pull off darker eye makeup during the daytime and night. Make sure you avoid anything pastel or shimmery.


The best colors to use: black, grey, all purples, dark blues, forest green, and browns with a red undertone for a more bloodshot look. Another way to achieve a bloodshot look is to apply red or dark pink blush before you apply your eye shadows and liner.
 You can go with no lipstick at all (if you already chose to have smokey eyes; you don't want to look over done!) or a variety of different shades. Most of the time, lipsticks with plum, burgundy, and brown tones work with olive, medium, or dark skin. Gothic lip colors include black mixed with red, blue, green, or purple, or deep berry and red shades.
 Basically any hair style or color you choose can work, whether you have straight black hair, wavy blood red hair, or big wild curly hair. Just get creative and style or dye it the way that best suits you. Some popular hair colors among goths are black, blue black, bright red, and colored streaks.
 You can't wrong with short(or long if you like) nails that are painted a dark color such as black, red of any kind, plum, purples, and dark blues.

 These will create the base for your blush. It may not be pink enough for you at first, but don't worry; you will be fixing that later. Here is what you should start out with:2 tablespoons sericite mica
½ tablespoon titanium dioxide
1 teaspoon red iron oxide
⅛ teaspoon white mica powder

, This will help break up any lumps and clumps. Place a fine sieve over a clean bowl, and pour your powders through the sieve. Use the back of a small spoon to scrape the powders against the sieve. Next, place the sieve back over your first bowl, and repeat. Do this about 2 more times.
 The blush may already be pink enough for you. If it isn't, stir in a pink-toned mica powder, such as hot pink.Be sure to pass the powder through your sieve a few times to ensure that everything is evenly incorporated.
 A sifter jar is what companies use to store loose powder makeup. It's a basic jar, with a lid-like insert that has holes in it. This will help you pick up just the right amount of blush with your brush when you go to use it.

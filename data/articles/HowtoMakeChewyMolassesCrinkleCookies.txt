 Cover the dough in a plastic wrap then refrigerate until it is firm (about 1 hr. or overnight), Put the remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar in a bowl. Using a 1 3⁄4 inch (4.4 cm) ice cream scoop form the balls of dough. Roll the balls in sugar for the coat and place the balls 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart on baking sheets.

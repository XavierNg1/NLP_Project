 The hole should be 1.5' deep and 5' wide. Get it as flat as possible on the bottom.;
, Buy a bunch of firebricks (used to line fireplaces). There should be enough that you can make a circle to your desired size with the bricks standing on their ends. Form the circle in the hole by standing the bricks on end and putting one next to the other.
 Use concrete, cobb, clay, or other fire-resistant materials to join the bricks together into a solid, strong ring. Let this material dry completely before continuing.
 Fill in any space outside the circle with dirt. This is so the ground leads right up to the top edge of the brick.
 Pour a layer of river rocks into the central pit.
 Get some paving stones or garden stones (the kind you usually use to make a path with) and use them to form a ring around the fire pit.
 Be careful not to let grass overgrow the stones and get too close to the fire.

 Your site should describe your business and the services and products it provides.


Include information about how to contact you, and if you sell products, make sure customers can buy them from your website.;
, In addition to a website, your home-based business should have a Facebook page and a Twitter feed.


Consider your clients and target customers when determining where to establish a social networking presence. For example, if your audience is tech-savvy about their social news, make sure you can be found on Digg. If video is important to your business, get on YouTube. If your business is creative, consider a board on Pinterest.
 Having a blog on your website or social networking sites will allow you to share information about your business and offer insight into the field or industry you belong to.


Update your blog regularly. You want to give people a reason to revisit your sites, and fresh content will do that.
 Gather contact information for current and potential clients, and deliver a weekly or monthly newsletter to their inboxes.


Share information about new products, services and other updates important to your company and your clients.
 Pay-per-click online advertising is popular with many home-based businesses because it can drive business to you based on what people search for online.


Check out websites such as Google Adwords, Yahoo Search Marketing and Microsoft adCenter to get started. When you use this model, you only pay the publisher, or website your ad is posted on, for the number of times that their viewers click on your ad.
Make your home business searchable. For example, if you use pay-per-click advertising, someone searching the Internet for "Colorado interior design" might be driven to your Denver design business.
 Yahoo Local and Google Maps are good ways to help local customers find you when they search for a service online.

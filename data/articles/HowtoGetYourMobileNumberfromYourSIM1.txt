 If you find an old SIM card but don't have a phone to test it on, take it to a store that sells SIM cards from the same carrier. The staff there will usually be able to identify the number.
 If you have a working phone but don't want to use it to activate the SIM card, look up the customer service number of the company listed on the SIM card. Almost all SIM cards have a serial number printed directly on them. Read this number aloud to the person who answers your call, and ask them for the number associated with the card.
 Many carriers do not assign a phone number to the SIM card until it is activated. When you buy a brand new SIM card, it might not have any number at all. When you place it in a phone to activate it, you will be assigned a number.

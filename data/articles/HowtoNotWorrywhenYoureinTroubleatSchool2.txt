 The first step to getting out of trouble is to acknowledge you did something wrong. Apologize to the teacher or other disciplinarian for what you have done. This will go a long way toward easing the consequences.For example, you might say to your teacher “I’m sorry that I fell asleep in class today. It won’t happen again.”

, Apologizing is a good first step, but it does not correct your mistake. Offer a suggestion as to how you could fix the situation. Be ready for your teacher to change your idea a bit. If you are willing to compromise, you might be able to move past the incident without getting into much trouble.Given the example of falling asleep in class, you could suggest to your teacher that you will get to bed earlier so that you aren’t so tired.
 Whether you are truly sorry or not, you might still have to face consequences. As long as these consequences are fair and within reason, accept them without complaint. This will show that you do truly want to fix the situation.Do not be combative, even if you feel the consequences are much too severe for your actions. If you feel that you were treated unjustly, talk to your parents or the school counselor/principal.

 As noted above, plastic worms and related soft plastic lures come in a variety of lengths and shapes. A partial list of these plastic worms is given below:

Finesse worms. These plastic worms are thin, short worms of 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm), designed to fish with light tackle in clear water conditions, such as those found in older reservoirs that have lost most of their grass and sunken timber cover. They are often fished with light split shot or "Slider" jig heads.



 


Straight-tail worms. These worms, usually 6 inches (15 cm) in length, resemble nightcrawlers in appearance, usually in everything but color. These worms are usually retrieved straight, although they can also be fished in a "lift-and-drop" style.






Paddle-tail worms. These worms feature longer segments and a tail that looks like the business end of a paddle or oar. These worms are often fished with a straight retrieve. Paddle-tail worms are usually around 7 inches (17.5 cm) in length, although jumbo version may exceed 10 inches (25 cm).






Forked-tail worms. These worms come in the same lengths and are segmented like paddle-tail worms, but they feature a forked tail instead of a paddle tail.






ï¿½French-fry" worms. These worms have pronounced segments like that of a crinkle-cut French fry or of a centipede or caterpillar. These segments create resistance when the worm is drawn through the water, producing an erratic swimming motion.






Ribbon-tail/ripple-tail worms. These worms may be segmented near the head like either straight-tail or paddle-tail worms, but they feature a curved tail section that ripples or waves like a ribbon when the worm is drawn through the water. Some plastic worms of this type feature little more than a hook-like tail, while others devote 1/2 to 2/3 of the worm's length to the curved tail; some feature 2 or more tail curls. These worms are usually fished in low-visibility conditions or in underwater cover, but they may also be fished in open water as an alternative to finesse or straight-tail worms. Some styles of this type of worm have a tendency to hang up in submerged brush, which some anglers try to prevent by liberally coating the worm with scented oils.;
, While natural worms are pinkish or brownish in color, most fishermen favor non-natural worm colors, with purple being the most popular. In general, anglers fishing plastic worms follow the same rule as fishing other lures, using light colors such as blue, green, or pearl on bright days and clear water conditions and darker colors such as purple or black on dark days and in cloudier or choppy water.


Some worms, notably the ripple-tail variety, feature 2 colors, usually a darker color for the head and a lighter, sometimes fluorescent color, for the tail. The fluorescent tail color can be an attractor in particularly dark water conditions.






Some plastic worms are impregnated with flecks of glitter to give them a metallic appearance.






In some cases, when the fish are nibbling on a plastic worm but not hitting solidly, you can increase your chances of success by changing to a different color worm, even if the new color doesn't follow the "light day-light color, dark day-dark color" rule.
 Use shorter worms with light tackle in clear water or clear sky conditions when the fish aren't biting, such as during the first few days following a cold front. Use longer worms when fish are biting aggressively. In most cases, you'll favor a length of 6 to 7 inches (15 to 17.5 cm).


If you're fishing for smallmouth bass, choose a shorter worm; if you're fishing for largemouth (particularly the larger Florida strain), choose a longer worm.

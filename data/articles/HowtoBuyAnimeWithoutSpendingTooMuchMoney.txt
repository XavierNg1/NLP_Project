 It's a good idea to look up a series on a website such as Anime News Network, or to read other people's opinions about it to make sure it'll be worth spending money on. You could also try sampling a few episodes online; there are many sites that legally stream anime.;
, You can easily save money if you find anime on sale, such as a "buy one get one" or "discount on all ______ brand anime".
 When stores sell used anime, it usually has a much lower price than an unused version. Though someone else may have had it before you, most used DVDs are in good quality and are checked by store workers before they are sold.
 Did you know that an average volume of Inuyasha costs twenty-five dollars? That means if someone were to buy every DVD up to volume 52, they would have spent over $1,300! Nowadays, most series are collected into boxed sets. These usually contain every episode of a series instead of four or seven like a regular volume. Though some may seem expensive to buy, with prices ranging from twenty-five dollars to all the way to a hundred, they usually wind up costing less than buying every individual volume of a series.
 Many places (such as Amazon, eBay, right stuff, and Robert's Anime Corner Store) sell used and/or discounted anime at much lower prices, and even the new DVDs are generally cheaper than other stores.
 If you do, see if you could borrow it from them. This way, if you watch it and you don't like it, you don't have to look at it again and you didn't waste any money.

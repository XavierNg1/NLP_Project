 Freezing is one of the most common ways of preserving food. Keeping the food at freezing temperatures generally, prevents microorganisms from increasing in number and spoiling it. Freezing can thus be an effective way to preserve the nutrients. Freezing food will change its texture after it is reheated so it is best to avoid freezing things like creamy sauces or yogurt, basil, parsley, soft cheeses, apples, lemons, cucumbers, celery, onions, and more., A great way to preserve food is to learn how to can, if you are not already familiar with it. Canning removes oxygen and prevents the growth of bacteria that spoils food. There are a number of techniques for canning that you can choose from.


Canning in pressure cookers involves using a pressure cooker to create enough pressure and heat that will create a seal to keep air out and liquid in. This is the safest method for preserving meats, vegetables, poultry, and seafood.Canning in a boiling water bath is ideal and safe for tomatoes, fruits, jams, pickles, and other preserves.
 Dehydrating food involves eliminating the water that is in food, leaving you with a dried version. This is popular because it is all natural, makes food portable, and can be delicious. Try dehydrating food like apples, tomatoes, broccoli, or carrots with an oven or a dehydrator.
 Pickled foods are soaked in solutions that prevent the food from spoiling. Pickling can be done without canning and usually involves the use of vinegar or a salt brine. Don't limit yourself to pickling pickles - you can also preserve yellow squash, green beans, and cherries in this way., Fermenting and pickling have similar preparation processes but the methods preserve food in different ways. Fermentation uses a process called “lacto-fermentation” to preserve food and enhance the nutrient content. You can ferment fruit as well as ferment vegetables.

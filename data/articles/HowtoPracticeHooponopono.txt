 This involves the acknowledgement that we are all a part of a greater “whole”, that is, we are all connected on a higher level and there is no need to analyze, figure out, solve, manage, cope with, or control problems. All that is needed is to go directly to the Creator and ask that the error/thought/memory be corrected and cleaned. Only Divinity can do this. Divinity/Creator/Love knows us and what memory is replaying. This is merely an exercise in letting go; there is no need to invite conflict with one’s religious beliefs or non-beliefs.

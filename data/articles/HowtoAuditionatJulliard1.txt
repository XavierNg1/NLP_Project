 Your body will need energy so give it energy. Never have any candy that will get you to a sugar high for about 10 minutes. hen the fat is stored and your at a sugar-normal. After this feeling, you will feel very tired, this doesn't in any way prepare you for your audition

, If you made your own solo then it will be easier, but make it stand out then others. You got the easy part if you have your own solo, now you have to make it shine. These judges want to go home and eat, make them love you! When they give you choreography or notes to play you have to memorize and address them quickly to make it in Julliard.
 If you are given choreography and don't get it, ask to repeat it or clarify. If your really shy then you don't belong at Julliard. Julliard is a performing arts that's equal or greater than the Olympics. If you want this you have to grab it, because it's yours!
, The summer before you audition think about going to their summer intensive camp. This will give you an idea on what your ahead of and it will prepare you better.
 You have to love the judges and make them love you! If you are dancing, for example, when spinning/twirling spot. If you don't know this term, look it up because you won't make it in Julliard if you don't know what it means. For example, playing trumpet look at them frequently, but also keep your eyes on the music if not already memorized. If your doing drama/acting, look at them always. Unless you have stage directions to look at the person always have a good eye on he judges!


Don't stare at them though. Have a glare that the judges can't forget.
Even when your taking your bows have this gleam in your eye with a grin. If you really want to jazz things up wink when leaving the stage.

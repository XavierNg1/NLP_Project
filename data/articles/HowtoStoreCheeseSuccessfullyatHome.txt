 Avoid any cheese that looks dry or discolored, as the seal may be broken or buy from a service counter from people who know their cheese. Check the freshness date on the package for fresh cheeses. When you get them home:









Fresh cheeses should be kept cold, in their original containers, and consumed quickly.
Unwrap all other cheeses immediately. Plastic wrap suffocates cheese.
Rub the surface of all but american, Grey, Bleu, and Washed Rind cheeses with olive, canola or other cooking oil. Rub only the cut faces of the White, Grey and Washed rinds. Bleu will protect itself.;
, Similar cheeses can not be stored together, as long as they donâ€™t touch. You can use plastic webbing, or the mats they use to roll up sushi, to stack in layers and still allow airspace.
 Dry, rub with fresh oil and store as above in a clean container with clean towels.
, Be sure to minimize contact so it can breathe.
 Wipe off any mold every couple of weeks as it forms. After a few treatments, mold will slow or cease to grow if your container has enough towels to soak up excess moisture. Change the towels and wash container often.

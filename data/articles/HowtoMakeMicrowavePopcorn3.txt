 You can use vegetable, canola, coconut, or olive oil to cook with. Set your stove-top to medium-high heat


Coconut oil has a slightly sweet flavor to it, while olive oil is more earthy and savory. Both vegetable and canola oil are mostly tasteless, but cook the popcorn well.
 Pour in the kernels slowly and be careful of splattering hot oil.
 In order to cook the popcorn to crispy perfection you need to let steam escape. If using a lid, leave it slightly off of the top, or use aluminum foil to cover the top, poking several holes in the foil with a knife.
 Pick up the pot by the handles and shake it up and down -- this gets the unpopped kernels to the hot oil.
 This means your popcorn is about done. Shake it one more time and add any seasonings you desire.

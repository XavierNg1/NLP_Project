, If you are going to effectively communicate with medical staff and serve as an intelligent representative and advocate for the mother, it is your job to understand when and why medication or medical intervention may be necessary.
 Your role will vary considerably depending on where the baby will be delivered.


If you will be advocating for the mother in a formal hospital setting, your advocacy will primarily involve interacting with medical staff and supporting the mother’s decisions before, during, and after the birth.
If you will be in a birthing center or midwifery clinic, your role may involve more advocacy for the mother’s comfort or explaining her preferences for medication and intervention should the occasion arise.
If you will be a birth advocate at a home or private birth, your role may involve communication with a birth attendant or simply serving as a coach to offer support and encouragement.
 Attending classes such as Lamaze or childbirth advocacy courses or prenatal yoga classes will, to varying degrees, help you learn about breathing techniques, the process of labor and delivery, what to pack for the labor and delivery process, how best to physically and emotionally support the mother and what type of birthing experience the mother wants.

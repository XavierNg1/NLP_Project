Pokémon League is only an option if you are at the point in the game where you can battle it. That means if you haven't beaten in once, you should do that first with a team of level 60-80 pokémon and lots of healing items.
Wild pokémon is the only option when you haven't beaten the Pokémon League yet, and is the better option if you only have to do a few levels on the training pokémon because the Pokémon League takes up a bunch of time, including a cutscene as well as battling 5 powerful trainers.
 The Pokémon League is hard. Make sure you have lots of healing items, such as full restores, revives and hyper potions.,

 Put down area rugs and door mats in high-traffic areas such as entrances and frequently used hallways. Make sure you put down good mats in front of entrance points from the outside, since dirt, water and debris tend to get tracked through these areas the most. You may want to ask your family to remove their shoes at the door as an additional safeguard.
 Felt floor protectors can be purchased at home improvement stores and even some grocery stores. Simply remove the adhesive backing and stick the felt protectors under chair legs, couch legs and other furniture, especially the heavier pieces. Felt protectors can help prevent damage and scratching on the floorâ€™s surface., If your pet has nails or claws, they may scratch the surface of your floor and track in dirt. To prevent this, groom your pets frequently and keep their nails trimmed. Cut their nails so that the tips are blunted, with no sharp points., Over time, even well-maintained prefinished flooring will start to show signs of aging, such as dullness, fading and mild scratches. If you leave furniture and rugs in the same place for years at a time, your floor will age unevenly. Move your items around every year or so to prevent this.

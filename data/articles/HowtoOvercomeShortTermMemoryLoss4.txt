 If your memory loss is bad enough that it severely inhibits your everyday life, visit a general practitioner. He or she can evaluate your symptoms and refer you to an appropriate neurologist, immunologist or other specialist to treat your condition. It is important to set your mind at ease about the possibility of underlying medical conditions causing the memory loss, otherwise you risk adding anxiety to your frustration.
 While a daily routine won't improve your short term memory, it will help you overcome some of the difficulties you experience as a result of short term memory loss and lessen the frustration. The security of your routine will let you focus on the fun parts of improving your memory, not on stressful parts of losing it.


If you regularly misplace your eyeglasses or car keys, try putting them in the same exact place every day, without fail. Create special spots for all items that tend to go missing and make an effort to always put the items in that spot.
If you struggle to remember whether you've eaten or taken your medication, stick to designated mealtimes and purchase a days-of-the-week pill container that you stock up every Sunday night. Set alarms on your phone, computer or clock to remind you.
Write down your routine so you won't forget it. Post it somewhere prominent, like on your bathroom mirror or refrigerator, or enter it into your calendar app with reminders or on a wall calendar in a place you pass often.
Write down every appointment or social engagement as soon as you make it. Program it into the calendar on your phone, or carry a small paper day-planner with you. In fact, doing both is ideal, as the act of writing helps to solidify the memory.
 Explain your problem, and that you'd appreciate occasionally having his or her help attending social engagements. This person can help you remember appointments, directions, your wallet, names and other things that help smooth out your social interactions.

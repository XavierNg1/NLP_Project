 Lay out a sheet of wax paper, and place the dough on it. Form the dough into a log shape. Now roll the log along the paper's edge, then unroll it. Now roll it again, but this time more loosely so it has space to expand while cooking. Finally, secure both ends with string.
 Place the spotted dick in a boiling steamer. Cook on medium to high heat for an hour.

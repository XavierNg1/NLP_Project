 Preheat your broiler and chop your vegetables and fruits to the size you want them. Keep in mind that the smaller the piece, the faster it will broil. You can also leave some items fully intact, like peppers. Melt a little butter and brush it on both sides of the items.


Broiling will create a unique and complex flavor. You can experiment with broiling almost any fruit or vegetable that you wish.Some popular choices are pineapple, banana, mango, pears, apples, asparagus, potatoes, zucchini, peaches, tomatoes and peppers.
 Use a shallow dish or pan that has sides so you can stir the pieces easily while you’re broiling them. This will ensure even cooking. Make sure to spread the fruits and/or vegetables out evenly so there is only one layer of them on the pan.


If you like, sprinkle a little sugar on the fruit pieces or salt on the vegetables before broiling them.
 Vegetables and fruits broil very quickly. Don’t put them on the top rack – they will broil too fast and probably burn. Use one of the lower racks that is at least five or six inches beneath the heating source.How long you leave the items under the broiler depends on how big the pieces are, but in general it will only take a few short minutes to broil any fruit or vegetable.


Supervise the items constantly so they do not burn.
Use a spatula to stir or flip the pieces so that both sides are broiled.
 Broiling vegetables and fruits causes their natural sugars to caramelize. On the outside they will be browned and slightly crisp. Inside they will be soft and juicy. The natural sugars will result in a sweet taste and the browned exterior will provide a toasty flavor with a pleasing texture.Serve warm. As an extra treat, serve broiled fruits with nonfat Greek yogurt, ice cream, or sprinkled nuts.

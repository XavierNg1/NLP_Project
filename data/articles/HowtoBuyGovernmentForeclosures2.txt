 These are houses that end up in the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VAâ€™s) possession as a result of the owner defaulting on a VA backed loan. In a VA foreclosure:


The homeowner defaults on their VA loan. Like in most other real estate foreclosures, the foreclosure process begins when the owner falls behind on their VA loan payments and defaults.
If the owner fails to pay their default, obtain loan modification, or arrange with the lender to sell their home as a short sale during this time, the lender obtains ownership of the home.
You do not need to be a veteran to buy a VA foreclosure., VA homes will usually sell to the public at 30 to 50 percent off their market value. Keep in mind that a VA home may be in better condition than other foreclosed properties. This is because the VA takes an active part in preparing their foreclosed properties for sale.


Even non-veterans can be eligible for VA loans, such as the VA Vendee Financing Program, when buying a VA foreclosure.
VA loans offer a number of benefits. For example, they do not require a down payment, allow closing costs to be financed (included in the mortgage amount), and have no prepayment penalties., The easiest way to find VA foreclosures is through a local real estate agency or in multi-listing system (MLS) listings. Alternately, the VA has contracted Ocwen bank to handle VA foreclosures, so a list of these homes can be found on their website. Once you have found a listing for a home you want to pursue further, contact the real estate agent on the listing., Work with the real estate agent on the listing to complete the proper paperwork needed to submit an offer for the VA foreclosure. You will be able to view an appraisal for the home and are able to tour the home with the agent. If your bid is accepted you will be able to work out details like financing closing cost and applying for a VA loan before closing the sale.

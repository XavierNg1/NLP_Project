, State the most important information first, make it easy to scan. If you want to add details put them at the end. Don't leave the punch line until the end. The receiver might not get that far.
 Don't leave them in doubt of what they should do. If the email is just to inform, tell them that.
 We all respond better if we are given a reason.
 Motivate them and make the action easier by giving helpful information.
 This is a great chance to leave a lasting impression.

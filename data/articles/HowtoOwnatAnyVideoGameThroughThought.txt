 Make sure it has events which are unpredictable and can take place anytime during the match. (Anything online is fine because you don't know what your opponents are thinking, hence making it unpredictable);
, Don't really try too hard to do anything in the game. Just go where the wind takes you and don't get upset if you die. Try to achieve a carefree feeling.
 Keep that carefree attitude you had in the practice matches, but now you have to point out your objective in the match. Say you had to capture the flag in the match. Don't concentrate too hard on trying to get your hands on it, just slowly advance toward it. If there are enemies guarding it then your new objective is to eliminate them to get your hands on the flag. Concentrate on whatever obstacle gets in your way.
 When you're concentrating on your goal, your brain will create the events necessary to reach it. If you need to get your hands on a sniper rifle to kill some enemies guarding the flag which was your primary objective, you may see your teammate die and drop it in front of you. Weird huh?

, The only thing that can keep this from working is that your opponents may use it as well and then it comes down to your own actions that will determine what will happen.

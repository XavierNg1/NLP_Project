 Find a large container big enough to submerge the entire skillet. Fill the container with a mixture of half white vinegar, half water.
 Make sure it is completely submerged. Allow it to soak for three hours. The vinegar will dissolve the rust. Remove the skillet after it's finished soaking.


If you still see rust on the skillet, use a scrub brush to scrub it off. It should come off easily at this point. Make sure no rust remains.
Don't put the skillet back in the vinegar solution to soak. If you let it sit in vinegar for too long the cast iron will start to degrade.
 Make sure it is completely dry by heating it up over the stove or in the oven for a few minutes.
 Make sure it is completely covered. Use a paper towel to rub the fat or oil into the skillet's surface.
 Season the skillet at a temperature of 350 ºF (177 ºC) for 2 hours. Remove the skillet from the oven and allow it to cool.
 To make sure you build a good nonstick coating, coat the skillet with oil, bake it, allow it to cool, and repeat the process again.

 Sometimes, you may not trust yourself to make decisions when you have depression. You may second guess yourself or have anxiety that you are making the wrong decision. To help with this, have someone help you make decisions.Choose one or two people you trust completely and who know you well. These people can help you make the decision by giving you their opinions about what they honestly think and what they think will be the best choice for you.
 If you are so depressed that you cannot make a decision, let someone else make the decision for you. During bad times of depression, this may be the only way you can get a decision made because you are incapable of making a decision for yourself.Make sure you trust the person you are letting make the decision. It should be a partner, child, or trusted family member or friend.
You may allow a person to make simple decisions for you, like what you want for dinner or if you should go out, or even major decisions, like should you get therapy or choose a medication.
 Cognitive behavioral therapy can help you figure out how to make decisions. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a technique used to help you replace negative thought patterns with more positive ones. When CBT is used for decision-making, you are taught how to replace those feelings of indecision or helplessness with a proactive way to make a decision.For example, during CBT you may learn how to make a pro/con list or how to look at the decision from multiple sides.
CBT may also help you learn how to replace emotionally-driven decision making with more balanced decision making. CBT can help you learn how to avoid jumping to conclusions.

 The chicken breasts need to be about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) thick. Focus on the thicker parts of the chicken breast first; you want the breasts to be the same thickness all around. This will help them cook faster and more evenly.No meat mallet? No problem! Use a rolling pin or heavy jar instead.
Can't find any plastic, zippered bags that are big enough? Use two sheets of plastic wrap instead.
Don't wash the chicken breasts before hand. You can cut away any excess fat if you'd like, however.
This method is not recommended for bone-in chicken.
 You can also use your own spices, seasonings, and rubs.
 Tilt the pan from side-to-side to help the oil spread across the entire surface. If you are using a nonstick skillet, then you don't need to coat it.
 The skillet needs to be big enough to big enough to fit all of the chicken breasts in one layer with some space in between each breast. If the skillet is too small, the chicken will steam instead., It is ready when the inside is no longer pink, and the juices are clear. The temperature should read 170°F (77°C).


Stick a cooking thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken. It needs to read 170°F (77°C).
If the chicken is browning too quickly, lower the heat to medium-low.
 Sautéed chicken is tasty on its own, especially if served alongside some rice. You can also slice it up, and serve it on top of a salad, or use it in a sandwich.

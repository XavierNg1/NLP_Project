 Add the pinto beans, salt, black pepper, and red pepper to the slow cooker. Pour 7 1/2 cups (1875 ml) water over the ingredients and stir to combine


Slow cooking the beans is less traditional, but it will result in beans that are more tender and creamier.
The red pepper is only optional, but adding it does provide the pinto beans with a nice kick.
If desired, you could also add margarine to beans for a touch of added creaminess, but the pinto beans will end up being creamy even without the margarine.
You can grease the slow cooker with butter or cooking spray before cooking the beans to make your clean-up easier later on. Similarly, you could also use specially-designed slow cooker liners to prevent the pinto beans from sticking.
 The beans should cook for 7 to 9 hours


Do not open the slow cooker as the beans cook. If you do, valuable steam will escape and you may need to add an additional 30 minutes onto the cooking time.
The total time largely depends on the size and age of the pinto beans you use.
When done, the beans should appear tender but they should not be falling apart. You can test your beans after the 7-hour mark with a fork to determine how tender they are.
 After the beans finish cooking, turn the slow cooker off and let the beans sit until they can absorb more of the liquid.


By letting the beans sit, they will absorb more liquid and become creamier
Leave the lid of the slow cooker on to help the beans stay warm

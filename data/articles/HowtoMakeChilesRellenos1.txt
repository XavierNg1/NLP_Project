 You will make two fillings: one comprised of meat, and the other of cheese.









Meat filling - Fry the ground beef in a standard non-stick pan. Chop up the tomato and one of the onions. Add the chopped ingredients to the pan when the meat is fully brown. Remove the pan from the heat and give the ingredients a stir.
Cheese filling - Grate the cheddar cheese into a bowl with a cheese grater. When the whole pound is grated, chop up and add the remaining onion.;
, Sometimes, you can buy the peppers already roasted, especially in areas where chiles are a popular part of local cuisine. You can also buy them online, roasted and frozen.









To roast the chile peppers yourself, put them on the grill or on a gas stove and leave them over the open flame, rotating until they are completely charred. Then rinse them off in cold water, rubbing off the burnt skin. You should now have 20 tender chiles ready to be stuffed.

 If you’re looking for ways hide the fact that you’re into him, you likely have a good reason you can’t admit your affection. Maybe it’s already been determined that he isn’t interested, or he’s off limits for one reason or another. If there’s a reason it simply can’t be, remind yourself of this.Literally talk to yourself. Say, “, this can’t happen. Think about something else.”
You’ll likely wind up laughing at yourself – which is a good thing, because laughter is distracting.
If it’s simply unrequited love, move on with your life. This can be a mighty challenge, but you’ll wind up happier sooner than you think.
 Admit it: there’s way more than one human you’re attracted to in this world, and likely even more than one you have emotional feelings for. Actively trying to transfer your affection may seem weird, but you can suppress your attraction to someone by thinking about someone else, especially someone you have an emotional bond with.
 Recognize that you don’t control everything. You especially don’t control other people. To help yourself let go of any affection you can’t admit to, focus on other aspects of your life, particularly those you’re enjoying.Remind yourself about the paths you’re walking in your individual life that have nothing to do with you crush.
Recognize your own free will – and his. If you’re hiding your affection, respect the reason, whatever it is and whoever it has more to do with.
Put energy and effort into things you can act on, improve, and enjoy.

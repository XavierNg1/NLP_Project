 Almost all cars have spark plugs located in a row at the front of the engine (or possibly on the top depending on configuration). Some older V engines have spark plugs located to the sides of the engines. With a few exceptions, cars have one spark plug for each cylinder.








Make sure the engine is cool before you get started.
If you're having trouble locating the spark plugs, look for the black rubbery wires running around the engine. Follow them to the end and you'll find the spark plugs. Otherwise, some modern engines have a cover over the coils and plugs. The cover must be removed for access. This set up typically has the plugs going right down the center of the valve cover.
Check your car's owner manual for the exact location of the spark plugs and the spark plug size you need.;
, Once you've determine the size of your plugs, gather the tools and supplies you need. You just need a few things to change your spark plugs. Get a socket wrench with a spark plug socket extension that's the right size for your plugs, as well as a new set of spark plugs.


In the past, a gapping tool was always required to fit the plugs properly, but modern spark plugs now come pre-gapped.However, spark plug gaps may still be set incorrectly (even if preset). You should always check and set the gaps to be sure.
Having compressed air, a rag, and rubbing alcohol on hand can help the job go more smoothly.
If you want to make sure the plugs unscrew easily next time you need to replace them have a bottle of anti-seize on hand to apply a light coat over the threads of the plug before screwing it on.
 Nothing should go into that hole while the plug is out, so make sure the area is clean. Use compressed air to blow away dirt and debris around the spark plugs, to make it easier to see what you're doing. If there's a lot of buildup, clean it off with a rag and some rubbing alcohol.

 The steps below give you a lot of different ways to use your mascara wand in your beauty routine, but none of them will work if your wand is still clumped with mascara. Use an eye makeup remover to clean it, first.
 Just apply hairspray on the brush end and use it to comb out the tiny hairs.
 Apply hairspray on the brush end (don't over-apply, otherwise your brows may feel stiff depending on the hairspray you use) and comb your brows the way you want them to stay.
 This works great for those with fine/light coloured brows (but anyone can do it), or those who want to add only a little bit of colour to their brows. Roll the wand through a matte eyeshadow colour that flatters your brows until the bristles are coated, and lightly brush the wand through your brows. You may experience a bit of eyeshadow fall out, and so you might want to do this before foundation (if you use it).
 Look for a bottle of Unrefined/Cold Pressed Castor Oil. Pour a little castor oil in a travel container and dip a clean mascara wand into the oil. Lightly sweep it across your brows and eyelashes. You will notice quicker growth and stronger lashes and brows overtime.
 A brow comb may work wonders for separating clumpy lashes, a clean wand works just as well.  When using a clean brush, it disturbs your mascara less while helping to separate clumps and picking up excess mascara (then if you were to use a brow comb).
 Do you have any other mascaras where you just hate the wand it came with? Save your favourite wands, and when the mascara runs out, use the wand in another mascara for better results.

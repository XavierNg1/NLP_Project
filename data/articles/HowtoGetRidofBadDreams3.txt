 Take actions to make the quality of your sleep improve. Poor sleeping habits can make nightmares more likely to occur. Take some of the following steps to help get a good nights rest:Get regular exercise. Exercise helps you fall asleep faster and sleep more deeply.
Limit caffeine and alcohol. Both can reduce the quality of your sleep.
Make time for activities that you enjoy.
Practice meditation or relaxation techniques.
Have a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time everyday.
 Start with your head and shoulders, tense and release those muscles. Work your way down your body, tense and release each area. Doing this has been proven to reduce the occurrence of nightmares by up to eighty percent.By tensing your muscle first, you allow for a deeper relaxation of it.
You can do this many times a day, in addition to right before bed.
 Don't do any other activities in your bedroom that would be counted as “waking” activities. By mentally establishing that your bed is a place for sleep and rest alone, you will be able to fall asleep more quickly and more deeply.


Avoid any activities, even simple ones such as reading or watching TV, while in your bed.
Only go to bed when tired and ready for sleep.

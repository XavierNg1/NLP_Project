 Make sure you aren't preventing natural run-off water from the position of the wall and footing. Observe the land in question for a few days prior to doing any work. Pay special attention to the area after it rains. You don't want to disrupt the flow of water so that it floods into your neighbor’s property., Stone walls come in different shapes and sizes. Some stone walls are similar in cut to an average 8” concrete block. Other stone walls use disproportionate stones to create a rustic look. Consider the time you’re willing to take on this project.


The disproportionate stones look the best, but take a long time to install.
 Footing is the concrete base that is used as the wall's structure. You can either use dry footing that requires you to mix it with water to activate, or purchase prepared footing.

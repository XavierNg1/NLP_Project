 This will be the flavor of your popsicle. You can choose lemonade, grape juice, Kool-Aid, or whatever else tickles your fancy.
 Fill up each popsicle mold so it is almost full. If you don't have molds, you can use paper cups or ice cube trays.


If you're using an ice cube tray, you can create handles out of toothpicks. Put plastic wrap over the tray, and place two toothpicks into each cup. The toothpicks should have a small amount of space between them.
 This may take a few hours.
 Once the popsicles have all completely solidified, remove the tray from the freezer. Do not tug on the toothpicks or stick, but instead press from the bottom of the cup to remove the popsicle.
 What ever remainders you have, you can put back in the freezer until next time.

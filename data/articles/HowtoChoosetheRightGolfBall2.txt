 Urethane covers have quite a bit of rubber in them. Using a golf ball with a urethane cover allows it to bounce harder off of the golf club, giving it more distance. However, these types of balls are also harder to control, so they are generally better for more advanced golfers., The center of this ball is harder. Again, they’ll go further but are harder to control. These are best for golfers who regularly drive further than 240 yards (220 m)., The layers of the ball allow for a particular transference of energy that makes the ball go further. They also tend to roll longer, so you’ll get distance over the ground, rather than just in the air.

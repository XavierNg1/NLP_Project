 Looking at the schools to which you were accepted, look at the college's offer on a larger context. Did they provide enough financial aid that it wouldn't be a hardship to attend? Think not just about tuition but room and board and travel money, particularly if you have to fly there. , Look at the creative possibilities, the academics, and the school itself. Debate locations and financial aid offers. Think about where you can thrive and achieve long-term goals. , If you're still not sure where you'd like to go, reach out to the students and faculty you have talked to and ask for their advice. Many of the students have probably been in the same situation and often have good insight into the final decision.
 Most places require you to let them know by May 1, so keep that date in mind as you're working on your decision. Let the other schools know that you will not be attending as soon as you can -- they might be able to offer your spot to another student on a waiting list.

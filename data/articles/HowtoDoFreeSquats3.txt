 If you come up to the balls of your feet while squatting (also called relev√©) you will work your calf muscles. You try staying up on your toes the whole time, or simply doing a calf-raise at the top of each squat.
 Instead of moving up and down in your free squats, try sitting back and doing an isometric hold. That is, hold yourself in the bottom squat position, as if you are sitting in a chair. Try holding this for 30 seconds, and adding time as you get stronger. You can also try doing this against a wall.
 Doing a variety of squats works more muscles and makes your workout varied and more fun. Additionally, when the leg muscles are strengthened, a person's metabolism becomes more active. Performing a mix of different squat exercises works more muscles and revs up your metabolism to burn more calories.

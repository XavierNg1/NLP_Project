 When you have ended a friendship with one friend, this doesn’t mean that this person is completely out of your life. Your other friends may still be friends with her. It’s best to remain neutral, or at least as much as possible. Don’t make your other friends take sides or make them feel bad for continuing their friendship with that person., There is a short period of time after you’ve ended a friendship when you can talk about the hurt you feel. But then you need to move on. If you truly want to forget about your former friend, don’t keep talking about her with your current friends. They don’t want to rehash the same conversation over and over with you.
 The loss of one friend might make you try to fit another friend in their place. If you ended a friendship with your favorite dancing partner, you might try roping in another friend to go dancing. But if that person hates dancing, then accept their preference.
 Use the experience of your former friendship as a way to become a better friend for your other friends. If your former friend ended the friendship and you may have been at fault, think carefully about how you treated her. Use this as a lesson to keep your other friendships going strong.

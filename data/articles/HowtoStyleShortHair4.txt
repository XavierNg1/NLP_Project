 Since this style requires holding your hair in place against its natural grain, you'll want to start with hair that has a little natural oil distributed throughout to help hold it in place. Otherwise, your hair will want to flop forward., Use a comb to comb it away from your face and straight toward the back of your head. Then insert the comb at the roots and lift your hair from your head without pulling the comb through. This adds a little volume to the slicked back style.

For a super slicked look, skip the volume-adding technique and simply comb your hair back as close to your scalp as possible.
For a less severe look, part your hair on one side and slick it around the front and then back, rather than combing straight back from the forehead.
 Use maximum-hold spray to hold the style in place. Be sure to apply plenty to the sides, front, and top of your hair, the part that will tend to move out of place after a few hours.

Consider wearing a headband to keep your hair from coming forward if yours tends to come loose from hairspray.
You can also pin your bangs back with barrettes to keep the slicked back style in place.

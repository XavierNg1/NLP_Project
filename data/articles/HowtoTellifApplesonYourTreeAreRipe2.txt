 The ultimate test of ripeness is the taste test. The flesh should be sweet or tart, depending on the apple variety, and slightly softer but not mushy.


Don’t be discouraged if all signs point to harvest time but the apples are not as sweet as they should be, especially if they are a type of Delicious apple. Some types of apples will get sweeter after they are picked and stored for a short while.
 Apples that are fully matured are also slightly softer in texture than unripe apples. A good way to test a fruit’s ripeness is by giving it a light squeeze between your fingers and thumb. If the apple indents a little then it is finished growing. It may take novice gardeners some time before they become proficient with this test, however.
 If all else fails, gardeners can cut an apple through the core and spray it with iodine to see if it is ripe. Iodine will turn the unripe cells a dark color due to the presence of starch in the apples. Fruits that are to be stored should have a completely white center and dark spots that take up anywhere from three quarters to one half of the fruit. Fruits that are completely clear should be immediately eaten or preserved in some fashion.

 This is the width and height of the measurements between the rough framing. Rough openings need to be 2 inches (5 cm) wider and 2 1/2 inches (5.7 cm) taller than the actual door size you will be installing. If it's too big or small you will need to correct it; otherwise it will make for a difficult installation.









For example, if you are installing a 30 inch (76 cm) wide door you will need a 32 inch (81 cm) wide rough opening. A normal sized door, 80 inches (200 cm) in height, would need an 82-1/2 inch (~209 cm) tall opening.
 Remove any packing or shipping bands that are still attached to the door. Sleeves on the sides of doors should also be removed. Remove the lock brace from the side of the door; failure to do this now will result in a whole lot of hassle later.

 Performing "rock the baby" will require you to be able to keep a yo-yo "sleeping" - spinning in place at the end of its string - for a few seconds. The first step in this process is to throw the yo-yo down and let the string extend fully. Keep your hand still after throwing the yo-yo.;
, Once the string is fully extended, the yo-yo will have plenty of rotational inertia and will begin spinning in place or "sleeping." Keep your hand still during this time to avoid jerking the yo-yo and causing it to wind up again.
 After letting the yo-yo sleep for a few seconds, jerk your hand lightly upward and then down again. As the yo-yo moves upward and your hand returns to its original position, slack will be created in the string that will cause the string to begin winding around the yo-yo's bearing. If it has enough inertia, it will return to your hand.

 Do you just happen to act annoying, or do you happen to actually be mean to other people? There's a difference between being irritating - simply being not cool - and being an irritating jerk - where somebody's mean-spirited and rude attitude is considered irritating. Learn the difference between the two concepts, for example:


The lovable Steve Urkel from "Family Matters" would be considered simply irritating;
While the arrogant Nermal from the "Garfield" comics would be classified as an irritating jerk.;
, Your irritating behavior could possibly be the result of looking like you're trying too hard to fit in - and posting less could make it seem like you're not trying so hard -- however, even if over-posting isn't actually the problem, laying off the posting a little or even taking a break all together could still cause other people's opinions of you to lighten up over time.
 It's good to speak with proper capitalization and spelling, but also watch your grammar. Evaluate how you speak. Do you tend to speak with grammar that, while not necessarily improper, may be awkward?

, In a calm and controlled manner, let them know that you feel that they're hurting your feelings and carefully attempt to set things straight. Try discussing your feelings over in a chat room or by sending them a private message or e-mail.
 Do you have a talent? Work on developing it, then show other people your work and make them realize that they're underestimating you (while preferably making an attempt not to pass off as egotistical in doing so). For example, are you a good artist? If your forum or chat room has a thread/section for people to post their art, then post it there. Are you a good composer? Show them your music.
 Maybe they mistakenly think that you're trying to be annoying on purpose, or trying to troll people.

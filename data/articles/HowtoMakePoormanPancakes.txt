Add margarine to the pan (if desired) to stop the pancake batter from sticking.
 Try to make it look like a circular or oval-like shape. Wait for 1-2 minutes for it to cook. You will know that it is cooked when bubbles start to form around the pancake. Each side should be golden brown once it's cooked all the way.

 Continue cooking with the remaining batter until the bowl is empty.
 Add maple syrup, peanut butter, etc. to them.
 Enjoy!

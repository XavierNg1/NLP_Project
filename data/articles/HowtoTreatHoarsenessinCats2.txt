 Sometimes hoarseness occurs simply because the cat has used its voice too much. For instance, if a cat gets trapped somewhere and repeatedly cries to get help, this can stress the cat's vocal cords and cause it to be hoarse for a day or two. In most cases, the cat's voice will come back on its own with some rest.If your cat has recently had a traumatic incident like this where it used its voice excessively, and it has no other symptoms, then you may want to let the cat try to recover on its own for a few days before seeking veterinary care.
 If a cat is parched and has not been drinking enough water, its voice can be affected. Giving your cat some fresh, cool water and encouraging it to drink may clear up your cat's hoarseness immediately.

Cats should always have access to clean drinking water. Restricting their water can be hazardous to a cat's health, in addition to affecting its voice., If your veterinarian has prescribed medications to treat your cat's condition, you should give them to your cat and follow the directions provided. Give the medication for as long as prescribed and give it to your cat as often as directed.

It can be difficult to give cats medication, especially in pill form. If you are having a hard time getting your cat to take pills, you may need to restrain it.
 Depending on the treatment that your veterinarian provides, you may need to provide aftercare to help your cat recover. If your cat has had surgery, you will need to make sure any incisions stay clean and heal correctly by changing bandages and making sure the cat doesn't mess with its injuries. Getting a cat to leave incisions alone usually requires putting a cone, also known as an Elizabethan collar, on the cat.You will also need to make sure your cat is comfortable, is fed nutritious meals, and is not in pain.

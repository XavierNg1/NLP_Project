 All fasts need to be broken carefully and slowly. Breaking a fast, in general, should take half as long as the fast itself. So if you fasted for 10 days, you need to spend five days breaking the fast.Fasts longer than three days are harder to break than short fasts. This is because your body gets used to not having food and begins to feel really good. Consuming food at this point can actually feel wrong (but necessary).
 The key to breaking a fast slowly is to make sure you don’t suddenly consume a large amount of food too early. In order to help yourself break a fast slowly, start in the evening so your sleep interrupts you and prevents you from eating more than you should., On the first day of breaking your fast eat a small amount of melon (or another really juicy fruit) for breakfast. Drink diluted apple, grape, or orange juice throughout the day. Have another small amount of melon for dinner., On day two of breaking your fast, eat three small meals of fruit for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Drink fruit juice throughout the day., On the third day of breaking your fast, eat fruit for breakfast. Then have a raw vegetable salad for lunch and dinner. Drink fruit juice in the morning and vegetable juice in the afternoon and evening., Starting on the fourth day of breaking your fast, plan your meals based on the ‘inner cleanse’ diet.

 Mix 1 cup (225 grams) of powdered sugar with 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of pineapple juice, beating them together with a whisk or fork until combined. The consistency should be fluid enough to drizzle but thick enough to hold its shape once it is on the baked good.


Use this icing on biscuits, fruit cookies, pound cake, and sugar cookies.
 Whisk together 1/2 cup (113.4 grams) of powdered sugar with 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of pineapple juice. The glaze should be spread onto your baked goods and should be too fluid to retain any form.
 The flavor of coconut naturally mixes well with the taste of pineapple. Whisk 1/2 cup (113.4 grams) of powdered sugar with 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of pineapple juice, 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 milliliters) of coconut extract, and 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 milliliters) of rum extract. The glaze should be very fluid and should be spread on instead of drizzled.


This tastes especially good on plain donuts and pound cake.
 Whisk together 1 cup (225 grams) brown sugar with 3/4 cup (177 milliliters) pineapple juice until the sugar dissolves. Spread this glaze over ham and bake as directed.

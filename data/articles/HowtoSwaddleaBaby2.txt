 SIDS, or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, is the sudden and unexplainable death of a healthy baby.This usually happens when the baby is asleep. Many parents worry about SIDS and they may associate it with swaddling. This is because, many times, the cause of the infant's death is later determined to be suffocation due to a number of factors. However, swaddling itself cannot cause SIDS. If precautions are taken, swaddling is very safe and beneficial to your baby.
 If you swaddle the baby too tight, especially if the baby is very young, they may have trouble filling their lungs with air. The swaddle should be tight enough that they can inhale, just not loose enough that they can get their arms free. Keep an eye on your baby for a few minutes and make sure their breathing isn't labored, if you're worried.
 Babies spit out their pacifiers and then get upset when they realize it's not there anymore. This is a near universal occurrence! But you should not swaddle the baby so that the pacifier is held in their mouth. It will solve the spitting out problem, but if your baby needs to breathe through their mouth or something like that, it can cause them to choke!

, This is the most important way to keep your baby safe while sleeping, especially if they are swaddled. Infants are very weak and often not strong enough to lift their body with each inhale enough to get a proper breath of air if they are on their stomach. This is why you should always sleep a baby on its back: so that it can breathe free and easy.
 A mattress which is too soft can suffocate a baby, if they do end up face-down in the crib. A firm mattress will let baby sleep and keep them safe.
 These present a hazard, if baby gets its face pushed up against items like these. Only put things in the crib which baby absolutely needs.

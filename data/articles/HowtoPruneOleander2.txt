 Apart from your annual pruning, you should also prune here and there when you see dead or damaged branches or blooms. Especially if it’s an old plant, or if it’s exposed to pests, it will benefit from pruning to remove unhealthy sections.
 Even if you’re just doing a few minor clips, still wear gloves when you are pruning oleander. Any kind of exposure can cause irritation, so even if you are just clipping a few branches, put on gloves and consider wearing long sleeves in case you brush up against the oleander., Take note of any shoots or stalks that look dead. If it is a young oleander, you may not see any. However, the older and bigger the plant is, the more sections you will see that are past their prime., Use sharp gardening shears to cut off the dead or damaged branches of your oleander. Try to cut them a few inches below where the damaged section begins. If you don’t cut off the entire damaged section, the branch won’t be able to regrow in a healthy way., If the oleander is not only damaged on its branches, but on the whole stalk, cut off the entire stalk. Oleander is an extremely resilient plant, so even cutting off an entire stalk won’t hurt the plant. This stalk will regrow eventually, and will be bushier and healthier than ever!

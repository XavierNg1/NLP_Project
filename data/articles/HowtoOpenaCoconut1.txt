 At the top of the coconut, there are three eyes or indentations. One of these is usually the weakest, so use a sharp knife to poke each one. When you find the eye that gives most easily, insert the knife into it to create a ½-inch (1.27-cm) hole.You can also use a metal skewer or screwdriver to poke a hole in the top of the coconut.;
, To collect the water from the coconut, you’ll need a glass. Place the coconut upside down over it so the hole that you’ve punched in it is directly over the glass.You can also place the coconut over a bowl to collect the water. However, using a glass that the coconut just fits over the top of means that you don’t have to hold the coconut as it drips.
A measuring cup also works well for collecting the liquid.
 After you’ve placed the coconut upside down over the glass, let it sit for several minutes or until all of the liquid drains out. You may need to shake the coconut a few times to get last bit of water out of it.If you are planning to put the coconut in the oven to help open it, you must drain it first. A coconut that hasn't been drained may explode in the oven if it's heated too long.
If you plan to use a mallet to open the coconut, you don't necessarily have to drain it first. However, you can wind up making a mess in your kitchen if you don't, so it's best to start with a drained coconut.
You should collect approximately ½ to ¾ cup (118 to 177 ml) of water from the coconut.
The water from a fresh, young coconut should be sweet. If the liquid has an oily consistency, the coconut likely isn’t good and should be thrown away.

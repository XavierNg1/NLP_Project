 It's the green app with a white phone icon on it.


If you haven't yet set up WhatsApp, do so before continuing.
 This option is in the top-left corner of the screen. You'll see a list of your existing chat conversations appear.


If WhatsApp opens to a conversation, first tap the "Back" button in the top-left corner of the screen.
 Doing so will open the conversation with the corresponding contact.


You can also tap the green "New Message" icon in the bottom-right corner of the "Chats" page and then select a contact to create a new message.
 It's in the top-right corner of the screen, just left of the overflow stack of dots.
 You'll see this in the bottom row of options in the drop-down menu at the top of the screen.
 It's just below the map that's near the top of the screen. Doing so will send a map to your contact with an indicator showing your location.

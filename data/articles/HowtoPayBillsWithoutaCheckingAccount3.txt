 AccountNow and PayPal debit card both offer ways to have a debit card without having a checking account. Both work somewhat like a bank account in that you add money to the account. PayPal debit is free (with the exception of some cash withdrawals),while AccountNow is $8 a month., Before you can pay bills, you need to add money to the account. That's because these accounts are basically prepaid accounts, and so you need something to draw on before you can use it to pay bills, which is one of the bonuses of these accounts. You don't have to jump through hoops to get these accounts, just sign up. Both accept everyone.With AccountNow, you can set up direct deposit for your paycheck or deposit cash at one of the many locations across the country.With PayPal, one easy way to add money is to buy PayPal cash. Basically, you buy a PayPal card at a place like CVS, Family Dollar, 7-Eleven, or Dollar Tree. It's just like buying a gift card. Once you have it, you use the number on it to add the money to your account., Once you have cash in the account, you can use your debit card to pay for your bills. Online, most bills can be paid with a debit card, but you can also go in person to pay the bill if you prefer. With PayPal, you'll need to apply for the debit card separately from your account, but it's not difficult to get one.With AccountNow, you can even use it pay bills by sending money, rather than entering your debit card on the bill's website or in person.

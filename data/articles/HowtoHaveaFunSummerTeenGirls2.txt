 If you're not happy with yours already, find a good set that really improves your skin. All the basics for teen skin are:

Face Wash/Cleanser






Toner (optional)






Moisturiser (oil free)






Face masks x3 (one for spots, one for dry skin, and one for a perk up.)






Spot cream

, Everyone loves a summer glow, and that's fine, just be careful. Make sure you wear suncream everyday, especially if you're abroad.
 The key to healthy looking skin is a rich, and smooth body butter, so get out and find a nice smelling one that does the trick!

 It might seem counter intuitive, but white wine actually works great on red wine spots (they neutralize one another). Simply pour white wine over the red wine spot right before doing laundry. Then, toss your jeans in and wash normally.


If this didn't work for you, try one of the steps below.
 Pour a little bit of salt onto the stain and let it sit for about five minutes. Rub the stain with a rag/cloth while rinsing it out with cold water, or club soda. Repeat this action until the stain vanishes. Then, wash your jeans.
 Egg yolks work particularly well on coffee stains. Mix one egg yolk with a couple of drops of rubbing alcohol and warm water. Take a sponge and apply the mixture to the coffee spot. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, then rinse. Wash your jeans as usual.
 Mix club soda and a teaspoon of salt in a cup, then apply it directly to the stain. Let it soak in overnight for best results.


As previously mentioned, avoid all types of water on greasy stains.
Club soda and salt work especially well on coffee stains.

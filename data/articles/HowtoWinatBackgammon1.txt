, Remember that blocking is a good way to prevent your opponent from advancing to the bearing off stage too soon in the game. Go on the defensive right away by getting two or more of your checkers onto some strategic points around the board. Remember, you only need two checkers on a point to make it unavailable to your opponent.Having two or more checkers on points will also prevent your opponent from hitting your blots, which will set you back in the game. Do your best to protect any weak points that your opponent might try to hit.
 If your opponent has any blots (points with only one checker), go on the offensive and hit (take) those blots. By hitting one of your opponentâ€™s blots, you will force him/her to move the checker to the bar and roll for reentry during the next turn. This will consume time and make it harder for your opponent to advance in the game., Bearing off is when you have all of your pieces in your home board and you can begin moving them into your tray. The sooner you can get all of your pieces off of the board and into the tray, the sooner you can win the game. Get your pieces into your home board as quickly as possible to increase your chances of winning the game.

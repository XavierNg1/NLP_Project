 Some other options include Eddy for speed, King for grapples, and Lee for a desperate situation.
 Back Back Square takes of 3/4 of enemy health. Some say he is sheep because of his sword but he is the best when you know his moves. If you opponent wants you to go o them go into meditate and your health slowly goes up, then when they approach you you can teleport behind them and attack.
 If you do, you'll have a firm style of attack from each of these characters.
 For King, learn linking combos. For Lee, learn his fast and speedy moves or use this: hold down circle and then press it about 4 times. This will be very useful if your opponent doesn't know how to block this move.

Paul is one of the most powerful characters in Tekken, but also one of the slowest. Timing is everything with this character. He is also one of the few characters that can counter-attack, making it easy to turn an attack back towards the attacker if you get your timing right.
To win almost any match with Paul, start of with one of the power-attacks that sends your opponents flying. Then start a rush towards him/her and stamp your opponent. If he/she manage to either roll away or get up before you get to him/her, do a low attack which gives you another try to either run over him/her, tackle him/her, or do another power-attack. If you manage to knock your opponent up into the air, continue to hit him/her in the air while he/she is defenseless for as long as possible. It's possible to juggle your opponent for at least 4 hits. Find a basic range of combos and moves, practice timing with different characters and try to keep your opponent as far away from you as possible. With proper timing it's easy to decide when to attack your opponent instead of letting him/her decide when to strike you.

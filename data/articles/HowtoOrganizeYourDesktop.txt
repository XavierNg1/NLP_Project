 Label these by year and folder hierarchy. Make sub-folders for each set of programs. Make sure that your naming conventions (the names that you use) are clear and concise.;

 If your version of Windows features it, you can use this automatic desktop cleanup tool. Go to "Start", "Control Panel". In the "Desktop" tab, click "Customize Desktop". Then choose "Clean Desktop Now". You can also choose to run this tool periodically. The wizard moves unused items from the desktop to an archive folder. It is the digital equivalent of scooping all that paper into a box.
 Use the menus, launch bars, or an add-on to launch frequently-used programs, rather than cluttering up your desktop with shortcuts.
 You can even install software to automatically align all your windows and make it much easier to find them in addition to increasing the size of your desktop.

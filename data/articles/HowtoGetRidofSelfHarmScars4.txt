 Makeup is best applied to skin that is free of oil or dirt. Wash the area of your skin where you plan to put the makeup and pat it dry.
 Concealer and foundation can be combined to cover up many scars, especially if they are smaller or lighter in color.


Choose a concealer that is a few shades lighter than your skin. If your scar is red or pink, choose a foundation with green undertones. For a brownish scar, choose a concealer with yellow undertones.Apply by dabbing the concealer on your scar. Let it dry for a few minutes.
Choose a foundation that is the same shade as your skin. Blot the foundation over the area, taking care to blend in the edges.
Apply translucent powder to the area. This will help seal the foundation and prevent it from smudging too much.
 Tattoo concealer is a heavy duty, usually water-resistant concealer that can be applied to the skin to cover marks such as tattoos. It can be purchased at drug stores. Some of the top-notch tattoo concealers cost $20 or more for a tube. Many also come with a setting powder to set the concealer so that it wonâ€™t smudge.Choose a shade of concealer that matches your skin tone where your scar is.

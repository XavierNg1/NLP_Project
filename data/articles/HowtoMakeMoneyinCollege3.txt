 This doesn't mean you have to do anything illegal. You can earn great pay and do a good deed if you sell your blood or other parts of your body, as long as you are healthy. Here are some great things to sell:


Sell your blood or plasma. Once you pass a few tests, you will be able to do this easily, though there may be some pain involved.
You can make good money selling your eggs or sperm, but this can be an invasive and painful process, so you should do your research before you go down this route.
If you have long, healthy hair, you may be able to sell it.
 Once you're done with a class, you will have many textbooks that you may never need again. Instead of hanging on to them, you should sell them online, back to the bookstore, or sell them to friends or people you know will be taking the same course.


You can also offer to take notes for people for a fee -- just don't sell your old exams, or you may get into some trouble.
 You can make some extra money by selling your old clothes, furniture, novels, or any other old stuff you may not need. If you have a roommate and you find yourselves with two microwaves or two mini-fridges, don't waste time and money storing your doubled things, and sell them instead. Here are some great ways to sell your stuff:


Sell your stuff on eBay or craigslist. Try selling your stuff at the start of the school year, when students will need it most.Have a garage sale where you try to get rid off all your stuff in one fell swoop. Advertise with big signs just blocks away from your home.
Take your old paperbacks to a used book store.

 With Netflix's massive popularity in countries where it is available, it shouldn't be too hard to find someone with an existing Netflix account that will let you share the online streaming portion of the service. While sharing an account password outside your household is not a violation of the terms of service, you and the account owner should be aware of these limitations:The account owner is responsible for all activity on the account.
There can only be 5 profiles on each account (used to determine recommendations and favorites), and only 2 of these can stream from more than one device at a time.
Local or state law can make this illegal – this is true in Tennessee – but Netflix is considered unlikely to pursue these violations to a court, if you cooperate after being discovered.
 Most likely, you don't love Netflix enough to switch careers for a free account. However, once in a long while, Netflix puts out the call for what many people consider a dream job position: a part-time tagger. If you get hired as a tagger, you'll spend your workday watching Netflix content and deciding which genre and description to label it as. If you're a film buff, it could be worth bookmarking jobs.netflix.com or following them on Twitter @NetflixJobs.

 A common reaction to cramps may be to roll up in a tight ball or press hard on the aching area. However, these actions will only worsen your condition. Because cramps fold the stomach muscles inwards, additional pressure will intensify the pain. Although you may be tempted to squeeze your stomach, stretch your muscles with simple exercises and do gentle yoga poses, such as the cobra.
 The Internet offers hundreds of different methods to help reduce your cramps. Find natural ingredients to alleviate your pain, such as hot water and raspberry tea leaves. Drinking plenty of tea will help soothe the chemicals in your body that are causing the menstrual cramps. Avoid taking pills or over-the-counter medications, as it will damage your health in the long run and possibly worsen your cramps.


The side effects of medications can be serious and health-damaging. It is best to avoid using unnatural methods, especially when it comes to eliminating your cramps.
 Inhaling deeply will help relax your muscles, which tense when experiencing pain. To further relax your body, drink glasses of hot water throughout the day. If the pain persists, take a hot shower and allow the warm water to soothe your pain. Then, apply a hot pack against the aching area while breathing deeply.
 Distracting yourself from the pain can be an effective method, especially if you find fun activities to participate in. Whether it's enjoying a cup of tea or watching television, find a relaxing way to pass the time and allow your pain to be soothed. Maintain a tranquil environment, keeping it free of work or worry. Although it may take time, your menstrual cycle will soon end and allow you to be free of pain.

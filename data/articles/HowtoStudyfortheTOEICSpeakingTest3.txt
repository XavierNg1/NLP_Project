 In an English club, you and others who are studying English as a second language can practice your skills, usually under the direction of a native English speaker or someone who is fluent in English. This will help you polish your abilities, and you might even be able to gain some insight into what the test is like by speaking with people who have taken it.If there are not English clubs near you, start one or locate an English-language chatroom where you can practice your speaking skills.
 Watching English-language shows and movies (especially with subtitles) or listening to spoken English will expose you to new vocabulary and help you get a better sense of how natural English sounds. There are countless hours of both audio and video online. Start your search for useful foreign-language multimedia there.When you encounter new or useful phrases in your multimedia sources, write them down and repeat them word-for-word daily. This will enable you to memorize and deploy them later.
 There are many ways to incorporate English into your everyday life. For instance, you might volunteer for an activity or project where you have to communicate with English speakers. You could also set your phone or computer to display alerts and menu information in English., If there are certain words that you know you have a hard time using or pronouncing, write them on a list. Read each word from the list aloud daily, and make a sentence using each. This will quickly familiarize you with the meaning of the word and its use.

 If you don't have a name, but it's up, you have a big problem. Think of something catchy, something people will remember.;
, Does your site/show have a theme? Is it really serious? Or is it totally random? Whatever it is, think of drawings that describe it, jot them down, and make a flyer from there. Pass it around school. Better yet, hang it up on everyone who was involved with the show's lockers. And for the REALLY daring, you can shove posters in between random people's locker slats.
 Tell the people you know in an e-mail, to visit your site or watch your show on whatever video site you put it on (i.e.-YouTube, Google Video, etc.). Also tell them to e-mail other people the links. Or, you could create an email saying, "Send this totally cool video to everyone you know!"

, If you are part of a club or a sports team, tell the whole group about what you created. Who knows, maybe they'll take a look at it.
 If there aren't enough ideas here, or none that you like, think of your own ways to advertise. Chances are, people will find out about the things any way you get them to know.

 This one goes without saying, really. You should do the research, get fitted properly, and purchase hiking boots that suit the type of hiking you are doing.;
, Socks that ride down into the shoe, prevent proper breathing, or are just plain itchy, will make your hiking experience a misery. Purchase good quality hiking socks, preferably those made specifically for the purpose. There are many to select from to suit any budget. Some hiking socks have in-built padding and special features accompanying them; seek advice from the sales assistant or the manufacturer's online website.
 There is nothing more uncomfortable than long toenails on a hiking trip. Deal with them before you even embark on the trip so that they won't be creating holes in your socks and causing you pain as the boot knocks them into your toe skin. Ouch!

, If your laces are always undoing, chances are that you have laces that have a slippery covering. Solve the problem at the start by tying a double knot.
 As you hike, your laces tend to loosen. It is always a good idea to check the tension of your laces before commencing a descent. Retying the shoelaces to tighten them again will help prevent such problems as slipping feet and toes banging against the front of the boot.
 If you know you are hiking somewhere that your boots might get wet, place plastic bags over your socks before putting on the boot. If the unbearable happens and your boot gets completely wet, your feet stay dry. Or, if your boots are wet from a day of hiking, put the plastic bags over your dry socks the next morning so that the wet boots don't create wet feet.
 Some hiking boots with high backed supports prevent your ankle from flexing as you walk uphill. To prevent your shin from being rubbed raw, loosen the top laces or tie only the second-to-top eye. You can tighten the laces again on flat or downhill surfaces.

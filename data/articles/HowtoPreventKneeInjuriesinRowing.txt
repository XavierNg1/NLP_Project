Many cities and towns with a marina, lake, or river have a rowing club where you can take classes or private lessons.
If you don't live by the water or don't feel comfortable on the water, you can use a rowing machine at your local gym or buy one for use at home. Make sure to take some lessons from a personal trainer so you understand the basics of the exercise.;
, A good warm up consists of approximately 10 minutes of aerobic exercise such as light rowing or running.
 Long, sustained stretches of all the major muscle groups such as legs, arms, back, chest and abs are recommended. A healthy stretch is smooth, without bouncing, and lasts between 20 and 30 seconds.
 Listen to your coach's instructions and those of other experienced rowers.


Coming up too fast on the recovery of a stroke can result in too much force on the knee joint. Pay attention to a smooth yet strong transition from the recovery to the next stroke.
Plant your feet correctly. Don't just use the ball of the foot or your heel; instead, push off using the entire foot. It may take some time before your calves are stretched enough but with time and practice you'll most likely be able master it.
Try to perfect your technique. By rowing with better technique, you'll need fewer strokes and have less chance of injuries.
 Straining your muscles, tendons and joints is likely to lead to injuries. Bring your intensity down a notch if you feel discomfort. If you feel any pain, stop immediately to prevent knee injuries.
 Muscles that are properly hydrated function better and are less likely to cramp up and create friction in the joints or tendons.
 After the main part of your training, spend between 5 and 10 minutes rowing at a decreased intensity to bring your heart rate down to normal.
 Spend about 5 minutes stretching your major muscle groups and pay attention to any muscles that feel especially tight.
 Strength and endurance combat fatigue, while fatigue facilitates mistakes.

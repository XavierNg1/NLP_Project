Each airline has their own policy regarding dogs on flights. They all, however, require that you call ahead to let them know that you'll be traveling with a dog. If the dog is small enough, it may be able to travel in the cabin of your airplane; otherwise you'll need to ship the dog in the baggage compartment. Service dogs may be allowed in the cabin regardless of their size, but call ahead to check on the airline's policy regarding service dogs.;

Airlines specify that the pet must be able to stand, turn around and lie down in the pet carrier. If they cannot do so, then the carrier is too small and you take the risk of your pet being denied access on the plane.



Depending on where you're traveling, you may have to provide a veterinary certificate to prove the dog is in good health, or provide the dog's immunization records. Always check with the country of your destination to see if they have any other requirements for bringing a dog into that country. Ensure that their vaccinations are current.



Due to the actual flight duration, the amount of time spent on the tarmac and transportation to and from the terminal, some airlines impose restrictions on the time of year you can ship a pet in the baggage compartment. For example, you may not be able to book your dog on a flight if travelling from Texas to Canada in the middle of winter.

 To get that rich Kahlua flavor, you'll want a good-quality base. And it should be strong, too – a weak coffee won't transport the flavors into the final product. Once brewed, prepare to use the coffee immediately.


If you're not so great at brewing a decent pot of coffee (it is definitely harder than it looks), you may wish to have a coffee aficionado do this for you. It can make a world of difference., Once the pot has seen its final drips, transport it over to a large bowl. Then, add in 4 cups of granulated sugar and mix in until the little granules are all dissolved.


Again, you could use brown sugar or raw sugar if you like. Just know that each little change will affect the flavor and it may or may not be to your liking.
 Once the sugar has dissolved and the coffee isn't warm anymore, add the vodka, stirring to combine.


Some bartenders believe in a combination of vodka and rum, or even different types of vodka or different types of rum within the same recipe to give it a fuller flavor. If you have the end of a few bottles laying around, try combining them – it may not hurt., Three 12 oz bottles will work well, but one large bottle works, too. Cut the vanilla bean into thirds and drop one piece into each bottle. After that, put the cap on. Your Kahlua is made.


At this point, you could also add in a cinnamon stick, cocoa nibs (about a tablespoon), or orange peel, if you like. This will give it a more signature, dynamic flavor.
 The vanilla needs this much time to infuse and the flavors need to settle into the coffee to give it that rich, liqueur flavor. Once the time is up, strain it beforehand and then rebottle.


The basement or cellar is good for this stuff, but a closed box in a dark room (or under the bed) will work just as well. Just make sure it has a label on it in case you forget what that mysterious dark bottle is in six months' time.

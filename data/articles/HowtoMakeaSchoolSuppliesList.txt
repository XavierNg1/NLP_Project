 In most cases, you can't just make up what you want but the school will tell you. This will give you an idea of what to get. If you need extra items, write it on the list.


Often you can print school lists out online, or some stores associated with your school might provide them for free.
If you have lots extra to get, copy it down with the school's recommendations on a piece of notebook paper.
Make sure that your list is on one page.;
, Clean each item to get a better look at its condition.


If your binder is breaking at the spine, has any torn pockets, or its rings have stopped working properly, replace it.
If you don't have any spare notebooks at home (or you just don't like the ones you have), buy some new ones.
If old folders are tearing, bending, or breaking, replace them.
If your pencil pitch or box is getting stained, tearing, or breaking, go get a new one.
If you're running out of any supplies, you'll now know what to get new.
 These include pens, pencils, a pencil case, an eraser, a ruler, a protractor, a compass, colored pencils, markers, highlighters, sticky notes, a stapler, glue stick, scissors, and notebooks/pads/paper. Each subject will have particular requirements along with the general needs., Include the quantity needed. Look up the stores you plan to buy from. Try to create a budget to minimize spending, stick to this budget and take advantage of discounts and offers.


Get recommended brands if they're on sale or affordable. If they're too expensive, any brand will do.
 When you go to the store, only buy what you need. Try not to pick up little extras that aren't on the list (unless you genuinely forgot about them). Be kind to your or your parents' wallet.
 Dispose of all packaging and other useless waste. Feel ready for school!

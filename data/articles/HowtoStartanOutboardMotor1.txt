 If your motor has a kill switch, you should sit close enough to plug in the kill switch. You will also need to sit close enough to the motor to reach the pull string without standing. You should remain seated while starting the motor to reduce your risk of falling overboard. A kill switch is a small part that is inserted into the motor to enable it to start and run. The kill switch will have cable that attaches to your wrist. If the cable is pulled, it removes the kill switch and shuts off the motor. This protects you from being injured by the propeller if you fall overboard.;
, Use the choke valve to restrict the amount of air coming into the engine. By turning the valve handle to the “choke” setting, you reduce the amount of air in the fuel. This means that the air-fuel mixture will contain more fuel than normal. The higher fuel concentration will help the engine start.If the engine is warm (i.e. has been running recently), you may not need to choke it at all.
 Set the gearshift on the motor to neutral. The motor will not start unless it is in neutral. This prevents the boat from accelerating as soon as the engine starts.You should also have the propeller lowed into the water before starting the motor. This improves the flow of fuel to the engine and protects anyone on board should the propeller start turning unexpectedly.
 Reach up and grasp the handle on the pull rope. Gently draw the handle back until all slack in the rope is gone. When the rope is tight, pull the handle back quickly. If the motor does not start the first time, repeat the process.If after several pulls the motor does not start, check the gas and choke. Let the motor rest two minutes before trying again.

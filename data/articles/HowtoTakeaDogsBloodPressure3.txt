 There are a number of conditions that could cause hypertension in dogs.Some, like obesity, can be treated with dietary and lifestyle changes. Others may require medication or even surgery to treat. Some common conditions that can cause high blood pressure include:


chronic renal disease

diabetes mellitus
acromegaly

obesity

, Your dog's nutrition doesn't directly cause any health conditions that would lead to high blood pressure. However, a diet high in fat may cause your dog to become obese, which is a common cause of hypertension.Check the nutritional label on your dog's food and any treats you commonly give your pet.
Look for foods that are low in fat. You may want to consider restricting your dog's sodium intake as well.
Give your dog plenty of exercise. Take your dog for at least one 30 minute walk each day, but be sure to bring plenty of water for your pet.
Consider measuring and restricting how much food you give your dog with each meal. You can find charts that will help you determine your dog's ideal caloric intake by searching online.
 If your dog has been diagnosed with high blood pressure, you'll need to schedule regular checkups with your veterinarian. Your vet will need to monitor your dog's progress over time and may recommend further dietary changes or medication.Dogs with high blood pressure should have their blood pressure checked by a vet every few months.
Your vet may recommend one or more medications, either to dilate the blood vessels (to lower your pet's blood pressure) or to treat the underlying condition causing hypertension.Which medication your vet recommends will depend on how high your pet's blood pressure is and what underlying condition(s) your dog has.

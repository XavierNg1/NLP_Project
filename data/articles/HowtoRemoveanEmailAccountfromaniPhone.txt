If you are trying to delete an iCloud.com email, you will be taken to the iCloud Settings page and will only have the option to Sign Out at the bottom of the page.
 The email account will be removed from the Mail app on your phone.


This action only removes the account from the phone. It does not delete the account itself.
Deleting the account will also remove any calendars or contacts synced from that account. If you just want to disable the Mail and keep calendars or contacts. Turn off the Mail button on the account page instead of deleting.

 In most cases, you'll want to add the berries to your beer during secondary fermentation. If you add the fruit much later, the sugars will not undergo much fermentation. If you add the fruit any earlier, you run the risk of infecting the beer with the bacteria that are inevitably present on the berries.
 Perhaps the most common and straightforward way to add berries to a beer is by pouring fruit puree or juice directly into the secondary fermenter. This will give you a full blackberry flavor, but will also lend your beer a bluish purple color.
 If you have access to good quality fresh berries, you can add them to the secondary fermenter as well. Before adding them, freeze and thaw them to break up the berries' cells and release their juices. Steeping the berries in a cheesecloth bag will prevent you from having to filter skins and seeds out of your beer later.
 If you use dried berries, you can impart the full flavor of the fruit without turning the beer purple. You can dry the fruit yourself using a food dehydrator or purchase the dried fruit from the supermarket.
 If you want to bypass the trouble of steeping fruit in your secondary fermenter, you can purchase a small bottle of blackberry extract instead. This liquid can be added directly to your bottling bucket. Note that the flavor of fruit extracts is often thinner than the flavor from whole or pureed fruit.

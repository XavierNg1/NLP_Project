 Many of these shoes are limited edition and sell out quickly, so there is no motivation for a seller to drop the price below retail value. It is very rare to find Jordans for under $100. If the deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.
 If you’re looking at Jordans online and no style number is included, email the seller to inquire about it.
 Fake Jordans are often sold in boxes that list details which don’t match the shoes themselves. Real boxes will feature correct colorway descriptions and all style numbers should match. If the shoes you’re considering don’t come with a box at all, purchasing them is not recommended., When buying shoes online, make sure multiple pictures are posted and you can clearly see the detail in each one. If a photo of the interior tag with the style number isn’t included, email the seller to request one. Stock photos of shoes are usually a red flag. The descriptions should be clear, not vague.


If the images provided are extremely small, ask the seller for better ones. If they aren’t provided, avoid the purchase.
 Unless you are sure of the seller’s authenticity, avoid overseas purchases. Nike may import from their overseas factories, but they supply from major hubs in the United States and Europe. Most fake Jordans are manufactured in Asia, especially China.Your chances of purchasing fake Jordans go up substantially if the shoes are shipped from Asia.
 Look for established sellers with a lot of solid feedback. Avoid buying from sellers who have very little or no customer feedback; the merchandise is most likely inauthentic. Before you bid on a pair of Jordans, do your homework and make sure all of the information and pictures look right.Trust your gut; if something feels off about the sale, it’s safer to avoid it and buy from someone else.

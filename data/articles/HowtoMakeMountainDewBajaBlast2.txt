 Rinse the lemon, lime, and orange under running water and scrub the peels with a vegetable brush. Pat each dry with a towel and cut the fruits in half. Over a bowl, use a citrus reamer or juicer to remove the juice, and separate the seeds.


When the juice has been removed, use your knife to carefully peel the outer layer of zest from each fruit half. Set these aside and discard what's left of the fruit.
 In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, cream of tartar, and 1 cup (237 ml) of the water. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring often. Once itâ€™s boiling, continue simmering for 20 minutes.


After 20 minutes, remove the pan from the heat and set the syrup aside to cool.
 Boil the remaining cup (237 ml) of water in a kettle. Transfer the boiling water to a heat-safe bowl and add the zest from the lemon, lime, and orange. Cover the bowl with a towel and set it aside to steep.


Let the citrus peels infuse into the water for one to two hours, until the water returns to room temperature.
 When the citrus water has cooled, strain out the peels and reserve the water. Add the syrup and citrus juices to the citrus-infused water and stir to combine.


Although this homemade mixture isn't the same color as Mountain Dew, it will have a similar citrus flavor. You can add some green and yellow food coloring if you want the soda to be a similar color.
 There are several ways to carbonate drinks at home. The simplest method is adding carbonated water, which you can either buy at the store or make yourself with a home carbonation machine. To carbonate your Mountain Dew this way, add enough carbonated water (up to a gallon (3.8 L)) to achieve the level of fizziness you want for the soda.


You can also carbonate your homemade soda using dry ice or champagne yeast.

 Sift the ingredients together with a fine mesh sieve. If you don't have a sieve, you can use a bowl and your hands to thoroughly mix the dry ingredients together., Use a whisk or a fork to incorporate the coconut oil and water in a separate bowl before pouring it in your cassava and flax mixture. Continue to mix everything together until it starts to form a dough. , Knead the dough on a cutting board until it is smooth. Take portions of the dough and roll them out into two-inch diameter balls. Set the balls onto a piece of parchment paper. Once you have a row of dough balls, you can either use a rolling pin or your hand to flatten them out into round tortillas.If there are holes in your tortillas, roll them back into a ball and make thicker tortillas.
 Make sure to grease your pan with a cooking spray or coconut oil before cooking the tortillas. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the flat tortillas in the pan on low-medium heat until they become crispy and golden brown on both sides., Set your tortillas aside on a paper towel-lined plate for five minutes and allow them to cool before serving them. You can refrigerate your tortillas in the refrigerator overnight and reheat them in the microwave when you're ready to serve them.

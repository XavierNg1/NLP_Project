 Do not towel dry your hair before you apply serum. Hair experts say that it is best to apply hair serum directly to wet hair. Use 1-2 drops of serum on medium length hair. Rub the serum between your palms well, and then evenly distribute onto the midsection and ends of hair.









Be careful not to use too much serum, it may make your hair greasy and heavy if you do.
 Consider using a heat protectant spray on your hair before you style your hair with heat. You want to try to keep your hair as naturally strong and vibrant as possible so you can use less serum.
 After you have styled your hair, put a teardrop amount of serum in your hand to start. You can always add more later. If you don’t want to squirt it in your hand, you squeeze out one to two finger tips worth of serum from the nozzle.
 Distribute the drop in your palms evenly to help you evenly distribute the serum in your hair. For example, you don’t want all of your serum to end up in one spot on your head.

 When dealing with a linear equation, the standard form of that equation should follow the form: Ax + By = C


Additionally, A must not be negative, neither A nor B should be "0," and A, B, and C should all be integers (not decimals or fractions).
This form can also be referred to as the "general form" of a linear equation.
 The equation should have three terms. One term should include an "x" variable, one should include a "y" variable, and one should have no variable (this is called a "constant" term).



Example: Change the following to standard form: y/2 = 7x - 4

, Since all of the terms must be integers, you cannot have any fractions in the equation. If there is a fraction somewhere in your equation, multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator of that fraction to get rid of it.Example: 2 * (3y/2) = (7x - 4) * 2

3y = 14x - 8



, You must isolate the constant, C, to the right side of the equal sign. If there are any other terms on the same side of the equal sign as the constant, add or subtract those terms from both sides of the equation to shift them to the left side.



Example: 3y = 14x - 8

The constant here is "-8." Since "14x" appears on the same side of the equal sign, you must subtract it from both sides of the equation.
3y - 14x = 14x - 8 - 14x
3y - 14x = -8



, Rewrite the equation so that the variables are all in the proper order according to standard form (Ax + By = C).


Make sure that each term keeps its charge (positive or negative) as you move it.

Example: 3y - 14x = -8

-14x + 3y = -8



, Recall that the A term cannot be negative. If it currently is, you must multiply both sides of the equation by "-1" to remove the negative.Example: -1 * 14x - 3y = 8



, You should now have the standard form of your linear equation.



Example: The standard form of the equation is: 14x - 3y = 8

 Having your hair loose is a classic way to wear it, and prevents a lot of the damage that comes from keeping it in elastics all day, every day. Here are some ways to get started.
 To straighten your hair, you can dry it with a blowdryer and a round brush, or flat-iron dry hair. Some people with stubborn hair blow dry first, then finish with the flat iron. Either way, make sure you use a product that helps protect your hair from the heat.
 Use a curling iron, curling wand or crimping iron to add curl to dry hair. Again, use a heat-protecting product on your hair.









To curl your hair without heat, start with damp or wet hair the night before. Twist small sections into tiny buns, and set with gel, mousse or hairspray. Take down dry hair in the morning and tousle gently. Do not brush out.
 To put some wave in your hair, dry it with a blowdryer and a diffuser attachment, scrunching it close to your scalp.
 The night before, braid damp or wet hair into two or four braids or French braids, depending on the texture you want your hair to be tomorrow. Make sure that your hair is dry or damp. Braid your hair pretty tightly so that you can comb your hair tomorrow without losing the wave. In the morning, take out your braids and tousle gently. Do whatever you want with your bangs. Enjoy!

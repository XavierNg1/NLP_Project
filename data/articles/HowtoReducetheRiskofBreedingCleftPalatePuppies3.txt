 There are many different types and degrees of a cleft palate. Many are immediately apparent, causing teeth and gums to show unnaturally, or a nostril to be misshapen. Secondary cleft palates may be hidden within the mouth, but can still put a puppy at considerable health risk.Signs that may indicate a secondary cleft palate include sneezing and snorting during nursing or eating, a runny nose after eating, coughing or gagging while drinking water, stunted growth, and breathing issues.
 You can peer into a puppy's mouth or reach within it to check for a cleft palate in the hard palate. Simply look at the roof of the dog’s mouth or run your finger along this area. Look or feel for signs that the palate is not entirely fused. A puppy will likely have to be anesthetized for check their soft palate, as this is located further back in the throat.Whether or not you are able to find evidence of a cleft palate yourself, take your dog to the vet if you are concerned about their health.
 A puppy with a cleft palate may need surgery. Unfortunately, the surgery will likely be risky. Obey all of your veterinarian's directions following a pet’s surgery, which will likely include the following:Provide antibiotics in the event of an infection.
Have the puppy wear an e-collar for at least a week to prevent them from rubbing their face.
Feed the puppy soft, wet food that has been blended for 2-4 weeks following the surgery.
Withhold hard food or toys for a month following the surgery.

 Look at them the whole time - they are your support team.;
, If you don't have a support team, or you can't bear to look at anyone at all, choose a point just above the audience's heads and focus on it. There may be a clock, a piece of ceiling ornament or a colored hanging - anything that is in a fixed spot that is roughly in the middle of the audience will help you to focus and still make it appear that you are looking out into the audience.Those butterflies in your stomach is excitement.
 Don't shortchange yourself on breathing; always follow the breathing exercises that you have been taught in singing lessons. Make sure that your breathing comes from deep down in your diaphragm.
 Use visualization techniques or counting backwards to calm down. Examples include:


Try saying the alphabet backwards in your head - this takes so much concentration effort, that you forget your nerves.
Close your eyes and pretend you are in the shower.
If you start swinging your arms, or other distracting body movement, wiggle your toes in your shoes. No one can see it!

, Just concentrate on your part and the words and enjoy the flow of the music through you.
 You have worked hard to get this far and now it's time to show what you are capable of doing.

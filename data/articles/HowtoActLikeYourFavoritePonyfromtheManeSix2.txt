 Work hard at school no matter what happens. You want a reputation as a straight-A student. Twilight Sparkle is always a neat and organized type. Never leave things to the last minute; the last thing a smart and studious girl such as her needs is reputation for laziness.


Read like crazy! Bring books to school and talk about them with your friends!
Use big words when you talk, for example, saying "tardy" rather than "late", etc.
There are so many fun quirky words for "confused" to use. Try to use "befuddled" "perplexed", "baffled", or even "flabbergasted"

, Twilight is always the friend who is saying, "Okay, girls, let's think logically..." Not only is this the way she thinks, but it's also good for your mind and habits. Aspiring to act as Twilight would is a big step to becoming a productive and rational thinker.
 Twilight has the "Adorkable" look, one of cute but nerdy and dorky. Knee socks and argyle or plaid patterns are ideal, and you should try to wear accessories with stars on them! Glasses would be cute and add to the effect as well. Wear mainly purple or pink accessories, as well as white and maybe some blue. Try light purple eyeshadow but nothing else that is flashy in that way. Bangs are very good.
 You want to show you are smart, not tell it to the point where you are most like Trixie.
 You want to be Twilight, not a hipster!

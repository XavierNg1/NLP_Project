 Google Maps is located at www.google.com/maps.
 In the Google Maps search box, enter the name of the city, area, or country where you want to start measuring distance, and then press Enter. Google Maps jumps to that part of the map.


You can also navigate to different points on the map by clicking and dragging the map.
Click the + button to zoom in and the - button to zoom out. If you have a mouse wheel, you can scroll it up and down to zoom in and out.
 Right-click the map at your chosen starting point, and then click Measure distance. A white circle with a black outline is added to the map as your start point.
 Left-click the map at your chosen ending point. A second white circle with a black outline is added to the map, as well as a line between them. The distance is shown under the second circle.


You can see the distance in miles and kilometers under the Google Maps search box.
 Click and drag either the starting or ending point to change the measurement.
 Click and drag the measurement line to change the shape of the line and add another distance point. You can also add a distance point by clicking the map.

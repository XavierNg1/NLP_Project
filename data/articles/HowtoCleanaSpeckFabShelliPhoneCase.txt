Get a toothbrush, preferably a toothbrush that is old and not used anymore.



WARNING: Do NOT use bleach. Bleach may cause the colors to fade away.
 After, soak the case in water.



Don't put a lot, just put enough detergent so that it slightly foams up a little.
 Brush the toothbrush gently in an up and down movement.



Add more detergent on the brush after each side.



Remember to rinse the case thoroughly. Don't leave any detergent.

Set it on low and point it on the case. Start with the back, and then the top, working your way to the sides.

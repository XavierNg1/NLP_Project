 You may find someone listed in a regular classified ad, from various sources on the Internet, or you may just meet a fellow collector at a gun show. In Texas, one private individual is allowed to sell a gun to another private individual, without further licensing, as long as each of them is a Texas resident and each is legally allowed to own a gun.


Texas does not require a license just to own, to purchase, or to sell a gun privately. There are certain classifications of people who may not own a gun (minors, convicted felons, psychiatric patients), and it is up to the seller at least to ask if the buyer falls within one of these groups., For a private sale, in person, within the state boundaries of Texas, a license is not required.For personal safety, if you do not know the seller personally, you should take a friend along with you., A bill of sale is not required under Texas law, but it is a good idea, both for you and for the seller. A good bill of sale will include the name and address of both the seller and the buyer, along with a description of the gun and the sale price. In case the police ever show up asking about the gun, you can show by the bill of sale that you came by it lawfully, and you can identify the source.Most likely, the seller will have a bill of sale, or at least a blank form. You can find your own forms online at several sources like formsbirds.com, texasguntrader.com, or tidyforms.com.
 You should ask the seller before you get together what form of payment is acceptable. Most likely, a private individual is not going to be able to take a credit card, and carrying that much cash with you is dangerous.

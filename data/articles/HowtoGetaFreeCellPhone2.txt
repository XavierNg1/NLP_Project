 Ask yourself whether or not your job can be done without the technology. Are you expected to be available for calls from customers or business partners at odd hours or extremely frequently? If you feel a cell phone or an advanced smartphone is necessary for doing your job, and you don’t have one that can fill the needs of your job already, then you should consider speaking to your boss or Human Resources department., When you sit down with the appropriate person at your place of business, inquire as to whether or not the company already has a program in place for providing cell phones. Many companies have such programs, similar to systems that exist for subsidizing gasoline expenditures or other transportation costs, in place for communication.


With the globalization of modern business travel has become a standard aspect of operations, making cell phone usage a necessity for many companies.
In the Internet Age there is a need for instant response times. Employees without cell phones are at a serious disadvantage in relation to competitors with cell phones., If the above points don’t convince the decision makers at your work place, try personalizing your argument with concrete examples of when your lack of a cell phone or your discretion to keep cell phone costs down hindered your (and your company’s) success or profits.


Remind your boss of the importance of being reachable, and the stress the importance of being able to reach the office. Sometimes you need tech support, product details, or a superior’s decision in a hurry.
Another great point to raise is that employee cell phones are no longer taxable by the IRS!

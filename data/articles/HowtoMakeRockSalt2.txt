 You do not need a lot of water at this point, but you need enough to create a concentrated solution. Aim for about 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water.
 Keep adding salt until no more will dissolve, and you see a few grains of salt at the bottom of the pot.
 Once no more salt will dissolve, take the saucepan off the stove, and pour the water into a small dish. You are only using a little bit of water for now, so that it can evaporate faster. You will likely have a lot of water left over. Either save this water for later, or pour it out.


Be very careful not to get any salt grains into the dish. If you get any salt grains, your salt crystals won't be very big., Put the dish someplace where it won't be disturbed. It will take a few hours to a day for the water to evaporate and tiny crystals to form.
 The crystal should be well-shaped, and not have any smaller crystals attached to it.This is known as a "seed crystal." The rest of the salt crystals will cling to this, and create a perfect, cubic crystal., Tie the other end of the thread to a pencil. You can also use a popsicle stick or chopstick instead.
 Boil some more water, and add some salt to it. Keep adding salt until no more will dissolve, and you see a few grains at the bottom of the pot. Take the pot off the stove and let the water cool.
 Don't let it splash into the water, if you may trigger the growth of smaller crystals.The water must be cool, or the crystal may dissolve.
 If you can, try to keep the jar covered, such as with a box. You want the water to be able to evaporate, but you don't want any dust to get into the jar. The temperature in the room must also be consistent., As the water evaporates, the salt will stay behind, and collect on your seed crystal. The longer you wait, the larger your crystal will become. Once it reaches the size you want, pull the crystal out of the water, and cut the string off. Pour the salt water out. You should now have an extra-large salt rock.

 A newborn will simply be smaller than an older one. It's important to ask whoever you purchase your corn snake from the snake's age. There are pros and cons to each side- A newborn can't breed and is more fragile, however can be trained to be friendlier and easily eat frozen mice. An adult, on the other hand, can breed, is less fragile, but may have issues eating frozen mice.
 Rather than a pet store, it's best to contact a reptile breeder and meet them. This way, you can ask them about the conditions in which the corn snake was raised and possibly see the snake's environment for yourself. You can also be sure that the snake was born in captivity and now caught wild., Some young snakes aren't fed for a long time, until they are bought in order to save money for breeders. This means that the snake could be starving and possibly near death, and as a result unfriendly to humans as well., This will provide you with a clear understanding of what to feed the snake in the future and whether or not you need to transition the snake out of live mice into frozen ones., Hold the snake for several minutes. The corn snake will naturally be scared at first, however it should begin to calm down the more you hold it. If the corn snake does not calm down, however, this may indicate that it was mistreated or caught in the wild rather than being born in captivity. Also look to see that the corn snake is sticking its tongue out regularly as well as alert, as this indicates a healthy snake., Specifically make sure the snake has clear eyes without cloudiness, even skin that doesn't seem particularly thin in areas, no cuts or scrapes, and no signs of mites or ticks.

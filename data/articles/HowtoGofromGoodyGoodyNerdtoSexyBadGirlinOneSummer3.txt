 It's a good way to boost confidence, make new friends and keep in shape.
 Be a risk-taker, be impulsive, and always say what you mean. Be a rebel. If you don’t wanna break the rules, bend them! For example, let’s say you have a school uniform, roll up your skirt a little or add lots of jewelry to make it unique. Just don’t do something stupid, like coming to school drunk or high.

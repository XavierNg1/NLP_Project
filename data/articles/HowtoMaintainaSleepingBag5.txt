 Allow bag to drip dry if needed. This is more likely necessary after the Bath Method. Have a place ready for drip drying, such as a clothes horse, where water can run freely (laundry, bathroom).
 For many sleeping bags, it is possible to use a tumble dryer. While this is suitable for numerous sleeping bags, read the label carefully before you proceed.


Set the tumble dryer setting to low. See "Warnings".
Ensure that the bag is not still soaked (allow drip drying first).
 Tumble dry at low setting only. Check regularly and remove as soon as it has dried. Placement of one or two tennis balls can assist in ensuring even distribution of down or filling.
 If you have sunshine, dry the bag outdoors. See "Tips" below for more information on hand washing a sleeping bag.

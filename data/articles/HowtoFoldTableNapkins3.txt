 Here, you will bring the bottom point of the diamond to meet the top point. You will now have a napkin that looks like a triangle.Press down on the fold to crease it.
 Take the left corner and fold it in and up to meet the top corner of the triangle.


You will now have a napkin that has a triangle with three equal length sides on the left half and a long triangle on the right side.
 You will repeat the action that you just used with the left side on the right side. Pulling the right corner up and in to meet the top corner of the triangle, you will now have two sides that are identical.


Your napkin will now be back in a diamond shape with the open sides facing away from you.
 Flip the napkin over so you no longer see the folds. Fold the bottom point of the diamond to the top point.


Your napkin will now look like a triangle. You will see a fold going down the center of the triangle. Press on these folds to crease them and keep them smooth.

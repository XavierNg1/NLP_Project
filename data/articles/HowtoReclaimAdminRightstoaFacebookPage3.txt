 Doing so will afford you some legal grounds if your account is hijacked. All employees or users on your Facebook page should sign this document before being permitted access.
 When creating your Facebook page initially, make sure you don't give any of your employees a title greater than "Content Creator"; this will ensure that they have the ability to perform page maintenance and create posts without having the power to remove you as an admin.Your title should be the highest tier, which is "Manager". No one else should have this title.
 If your employees are posting information that goes against Facebook's copyright or trademark agreements, your page may have its privileges revoked by Facebook until the offending material is removed.
 Happy employees don't take over administrator accounts or attempt to steal intellectual property; make sure you're listening and responding to your employees' feedback in order to cultivate a positive work environment.

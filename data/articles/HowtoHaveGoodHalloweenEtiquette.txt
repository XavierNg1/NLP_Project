 People are more likely to give you extra candy if you look and act nice. If you want to find humor in your costumes, go as a toilet, plunger, etc.;
, It's expected for you to be a little louder than normal, but screaming on the top of your lungs will just be a pain to the people in their houses. Some people may have kids who are trying to sleep and they will not be impressed if you wake them up. Also, keep in mind what you say when talking to your friends. There will be kids younger than you and you don't want to teach them any words that are rude or mean as it is not nice.
 Ring it once and only once. If there is no bell or it doesn't seem to be working, you may knock. If after 30 seconds nobody is answering, try again.
 Be sure to say thank you after they give you treats. If they comment on or ask questions about your costume, just reply in a nice voice without sounding rude or conceited.
 If you have been there before, you should not go again. It does not matter how good their candy is.
 Either they have no candy or they ran out.
 It's mean and rude!

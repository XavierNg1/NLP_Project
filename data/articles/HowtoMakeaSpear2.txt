 When making a knife spear, you want to find a handle that will be easy to cut into but sturdy enough to use as a weapon or tool. Avoid using green wood. Recently deceased trees are ideal.Search for a limb that is roughly 1 inch (2.5Â cm) in diameter.
 Trim any branches or knobs off the chosen limb and make a clean handle. You may choose to remove some of the bark in order to make the handle easier to grip., Choose which end of the branch you will be attaching the knife to. Using a sharp knife, cut long, thin, vertical strips off the branch until you are left with a shelf for the knife.Creating a shelf lends support to your spear and will aid in securing the knife to the handle.Brace the branch against another tree or stump to make this process safer and easier., Use a length of rope or other available cordage to secure the knife to the branch. Tie one end of the rope to a tree trunk and wrap the other end around the knife and branch. Walk away until the line is taught. Then, using your body weight to keep the line taught, begin wrapping the rope around your knife.Wrap the rope all the way up to the hilt of the knife. For extra security make another pass back down the handle. Finish the wrap with a simple knot.

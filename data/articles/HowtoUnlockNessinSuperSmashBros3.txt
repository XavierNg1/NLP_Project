 Play any ten fights, then beat Ness when he challenges you. You'll also get the stage "Magicant" for winning., This is identical to the one-player mode in the original game. Simply pick any character and beat the classic mode to fight and defeat Ness., Ness hasn't changed much from earlier games. He still has a good grab, if not the best in the game, so keep some distance and use your speed to rack up damage while avoiding grabs.

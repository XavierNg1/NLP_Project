 Most extra-short haircuts are achieved with an electric razor and a pair of scissors. Make sure you have the guard you want for the razor (which will determine how much of your hair it cuts off) and sharp scissors.
 You can wash it, or simply dampen it with a spray bottle before you start. Wet hair is easier to cut, and makes cleanup a breeze.
 For a traditional men's cut, the hair on the top of your head should be slightly longer than it is on the sides and back.


Start an inch or two (2.5-5 cm) above your ear, and follow that line around the back of your head the other ear, moving the razor in a straight-up motion as you cut.
Then, starting at your forehead, trim the top of your hair by moving the razor back over the natural curve of your head.
Catch any spots you missed between these two areas.
 Put the shorter guard on your razor. Start with your sideburns, moving the razor in an upwards motion. Cut just as far as the point where you started using the longer guard.


On the back of your head, start the razor at your neck and move upward, again stopping where you cut with the longer guard.
Don't worry about the difference in length for now - that's where the scissors come in.
 Using the index and middle fingers of your non-dominant hand, grab a section of longer hair that's just above where you switched guards.


With the scissors, carefully trim the hair until the two different lengths blend into each other.
Do this all the way around your head until the two sections look well-blended and the there is no obvious difference between the two lengths.
Have a friend double-check the back of your head, or use a hand mirror in front of a larger mirror to check it yourself.
If the "long" part of your hair on top is shorter than finger-width, then skip using your index and middle fingers to pull out sections.

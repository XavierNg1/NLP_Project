 You may need to pin the fabric for it to stay folded. Make sure to pin near the crease of the fabric, because you do not want to put the pins in places that you will be sewing. Your fabric should be folded so that the wrong sides face outward and right sides, or sides you want to show, are facing each other. You want the wrong sides facing out because you will soon be turning the strap right side out.
 Use a sewing machine or hand stitch to Sew down the length of the fabric ¼ inch from the edges of the fabric using a running stitch. Then trim the edges of the fabric to make the allowance slightly smaller. Make sure to use a thread that matches the colour of the strap. Do this for both straps. , Both of your straps should now look like tubes, with a little excess fabric after the seams. Take a set of small scissors and cut a small slit into the tube, about ½ inch from the end of each strap. , Take a bobby pin and insert it so that one prong of the pin is inside the tube and one prong is outside. Push the bobby pin down the slit, still with one prong inside the tube and one outside. You can also use a safety pin, but be careful not to prick yourself when using one.
 The easiest way to do this is to scrunch the fabric of the strap around the bobby pin. Hold the bobby pin vertically with the base of the pin facing downwards and the prongs facing upwards.
Pull the fabric down by scrunching it until you see prongs of the bobby pin emerge out of the other end.
 Grab portion of fabric with the slit near the base of the pin. Pull up. This will turn the tube right side out, so that the excess fabric is hidden inside the tube. , Now that the straps are made, iron them to make them flat. If you are having trouble getting the straps to lay flat before you iron them, safety pin the straps. Leave them this way for an hour or so and then come back and iron.

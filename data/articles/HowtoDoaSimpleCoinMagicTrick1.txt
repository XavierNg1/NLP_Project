 Allow them a moment of disbelief. Make it sound convincing, letting them know that you've been practicing the lost art of telekinesis for a while now. The more they doubt you, the more fun it becomes.

 It's going to look like you're sort of just waving your fist over your other hand – what the audience doesn't see is that the coin drops into your other hand. As soon as you feel the coin drop, clench your other fist.

 They will, hopefully, choose the original hand, since it never opened up to deposit the coin in the other hand.


If they choose the new hand, demand they explain to you how you could've possibly had the coin change hands if it weren't for your amazing telekinetic powers.
 If you managed to not move your fingers when the coin dropped and clenched your fist soon enough in catching the coin, your friends will be adequately wowed. Now, can you move that table over there?









If this trick is proving difficult to master, move to a smaller coin. It will more easily fall through any gap you create in your fingers.

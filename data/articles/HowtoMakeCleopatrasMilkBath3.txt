 For the salt, you can use sea salt or Epsom salt. For the milk, you can use goat's milk or cow's milk. Which ever milk you decide to use, try to use a full-fat variety. It will be more moisturizing for your skin than the low-fat or nonfat kind.
 You can also use honey powder instead. Using dry honey instead of liquid honey will make it easier to mix into the milk powder.You also won't have to store it in the fridge.
 You can use a blender or a coffee grinder. This will make the milk bath easier to use, and will prevent your drain from getting clogged.
 You can do this using a mortar and pestle, or a coffee grinder. If you don't like lavender, try another type of dried flower, such as chamomile, rose, or lily., You can use any type of oil you'd like, but scents that go well with milk and honey baths include: geranium, lavender, mandarin, and ylang ylang., Keep shaking until all of the ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the milk powder.
 Avoid using water that is too hot, or you will ruin the beneficial properties of the honey.
 Store any leftover mixture in a cool, dry place. If needed, give the water a gentle swish with your hand, to help mix the powder in better.
 Don't use soap during this bath. When you are done, drain the tub, and rinse yourself off with soap and fresh water.


To get the most out of the bath's fragrance, consider closing the bathroom door so that the aromas don't escape.

 Each universe is a collection of thousands of players. There is no difference between any of them, except for universe 5, 30, 35, 40, and 42;
, You will do this throughout the entire game, but for the beginning stages of the game, this is the main priority. Mines will get you resources (sometimes called "res" for short), which is used to build and research things in the game. Basically, it's the currency of the game.
 Defense, as you might guess, deters other OGame players from attacking you to steal your resources.
 Before you can, however, you must build a research lab. The more you research, the more things you will be able to build, the faster some ships will be, and various other things which will prove important. The higher your research level the better and quicker things get done. Research is vital so after you can raid start building this up if your a turtle you will want to get laser 6 asap for heavy lasers. If your a raider get those drives up and get impulse to level 6 for the coveted bomber which has rapid fire on every defense.
 The most important thing for you is your fleet of ships. You will use your fleet to attack other people.

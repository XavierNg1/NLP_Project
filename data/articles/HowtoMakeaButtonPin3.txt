 The color and style of the buttons is entirely up to you but you might like to consider some of the following ideas:


Choose matching but varying hues.
Choose the exact same color; this could be good where you want it stand out against a plain top.
Choose a rainbow of colors.
Choose different patterns, or even sizes of buttons.
Whatever buttons you choose, ensure that they are in excellent condition and will be able to withstand being turned into an often-worn item of jewelry. Older, more fragile buttons may not be ideal for this project.
 For alternating colors, choose an even number of buttons. Arrange the buttons in a circle, alternating the colors and check that the look is suitable. You can have an odd number of buttons if the colors are matching.
 For this, the button needs to be much larger than the petal buttons, as they will sit around it. You can either match this button to the petals or choose a button in a completely different color, texture or style, as long as you like how it looks.


Place the large central button over the already-made circle of petal buttons. Make sure you can see the petals poking out from around the edges.
 Place this one on top of the big button. Do the same for each additional layer you want (obviously, you're limited by how large your central button is).
, Using hot glue, glue the petals to the center. Then flip it back over. Use hot glue again, but this time to add the center layers. Now you have a fixed button flower.
 Glue it to the back of the flower.
 On the side that doesn't open, lather this with hot glue. Place it on the middle of the craft foam circle. Then place a lot of glue on either side of the pin, and on top of the side that doesn't close. Press it in for a few seconds. Then let it dry. If needed, add more glue until the pin sticks.
 Enjoy your new button pin.

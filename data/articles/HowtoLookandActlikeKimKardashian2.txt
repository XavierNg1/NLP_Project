 A variety of different styles in your closet is important if you are trying to be like Kim. If you change up your style and don't always wear the same thing, then people will be much more interested.


Kim wears her hair up, down, half-up or whatever is her day! Try different hairstyles--a braid on the side is nice--up or down.

 There are over 600 varieties of heirloom tomatoes; each has its own unique flavor and appearance. In choosing the variety to buy, consider the following:

How much fruit do you want your tomato plants to produce? Some varieties do not produce as much fruit as modern hybrid varieties.
Do you need tomatoes that transport well? Some just aren't good travelers, which explains why they fell out of favor over the years.;
, Heirloom tomato seed packs may contain anywhere from 25 to 75 seeds, depending on the variety of tomato, the experience of the gardener and the seed company.
 The growing season differs quite a bit from one area to another, and you’ll have a better crop—and taste—if you learn which variety grows best in your area.

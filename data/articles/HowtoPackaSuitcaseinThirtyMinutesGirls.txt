 Make sure it's not too heavy or big, because you don't want to overpack and have to pay expensive overweight luggage fees.;
, Pack 1-2 extra tops and 1-2 less pants or shorts than the days you're traveling. Remember to pack PJ's, underwear, socks, bras, and your bathing suit, no matter where you go. Also, if you're traveling on a plane, make sure to pack an outfit in your carry on in case your luggage gets lost.
 A traveling outfit is something comfy you would like to wear on the car ride or flight there. (keep your traveling outfit out that you are going to wear on the way there and pack the other.)

, You'll need a toothbrush, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, sponge, toothpaste, deodorant, and maybe perfume and/or lotion.
 Just make sure not to bring too much, and if you're traveling by air and keeping your makeup in your carry-on, don't forget about the TSA rule (3.4 fl. oz or 100 millimeters per object max.)

, Try to keep it small, like tennis shoes or sneakers and a pair of flip-flops.
 A fun bag is a bag full of stuff to keep you entertained on the way there. It contains one or two books, an iPod, Nintendo or Game Boy, a few games, a drawing pad, your diary, your phone, chargers, your laptop, headphones, etc.

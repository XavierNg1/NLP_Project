 Have your cat in a standing position and kneel behind it. Place your thumbs on its backbone and spread your hands down over its ribcage. Then feel for your cat’s ribs.You should be able to feel your cats ribs, but they should not be visible with your naked eye. If your cat’s ribs, spine, and pelvic bone are visible, then your cat may be underweight.
If a thin or thick layer of fat is preventing your from feeling your cat’s ribs, then it may be overweight or obese.;
, Do this by viewing your cat from the side, i.e., its profile. Get on your hands and knees to view its profile from an even level. Your cat’s abdomen should tuck up in front of its hind legs. Its underbelly, i.e., flank fold, should also be present.If your cat’s abdomen tucks up sharply and an underbelly is not present, then it may be underweight.
If your cat’s abdomen only tucks up slightly (or not at all) and its underbelly wobbles or sways when your cat walks, then it may be overweight.
 Do this by viewing your cat from above while it is in a standing position. Try to observe a visible waistline in the space between its ribcage and hindquarters. Look for a slight narrowing in this area.If your cat’s waist dramatically narrows behind its ribcage, then your cat may be underweight.
If your cat has little or no waistline and its back broadens, giving it a rounded shape, then it may be overweight.

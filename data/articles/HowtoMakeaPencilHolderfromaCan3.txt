 Paint designs onto the can to customize your pencil holder. Acrylic paint is a great all-purpose medium for painting on various surfaces, and dries quickly, allowing you to continue to decorate your pencil holder.


Use a primer before applying paint to the can in order to ensure the paint adheres to the metal.Use acrylic spray paint to give your can a full, uniform coat for adding further designs.
The paint on your can will likely crack if the can is bent, so be careful once the paint has dried.
 Use a box cutter to cut various designs into the can. Hearts, diamonds, abstract patterns, or faces are all fun options for customizing your pencil holder.Avoid grabbing the can near these designs, as the holes created will have sharp edges.
Try marking the designs you will be cutting with stencils to help guide your cutting efforts.
 Draw some designs on a piece of paper and paste them on the can as decoration. You can also paste an entire sheet of plain paper onto the can as a canvas for additional paper decorations.


Cut your name out of paper, or another’s name if you are giving the pencil holder as a gift, and paste it onto the can to mark the can as yours.
Glue sparkles, felt, ribbon and other accoutrements to put the finishing touches on your design.
 A homemade cozy for your pencil holder can help bring some warmth to its appearance. Feel free to knit whatever design fits the room you’re placing the pencil holder in, or make multiple cozies to keep the style of the can fresh.If you used a soda can for your pencil holder, you can also purchase a regular cozy from the convenience store. These can at least give your pencil holder stability, if you aren’t concerned about the design.

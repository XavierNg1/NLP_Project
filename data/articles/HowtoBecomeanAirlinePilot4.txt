Prepare a one page, professional pilot resume. The resume should be broken down into sections with your contact information, ratings and flight hours, experience and chronological job history and any awards or accomplishments.
Get recommendations. Have other pilots who have direct knowledge of your flying skills write letters of recommendation.
Fill out applications and update regularly. A search of the company website is a good place to look for minimum requirements and how to apply.

Collect records such as College Transcripts, Military Records, Licenses, Medical, Passport, Criminal Background Check and Driver's Records.
Prepare early for the interview. The interview can be stressful. There will usually be a story telling section with "Tell us about a time when...." questions, and technical questions. Check professional pilot websites where pilots share airline specific interview experiences.
Pay for a practice mock interview. There are several companies that offer resume review services and conduct mock interviews. The chance to practice in front of an audience and get unbiased feedback can be invaluable.
Simulator preparation. Get some practice time if the airline conducts a simulator check. Some companies offer airline specific interview simulator preparation.
Dress appropriately. Generally, a dark navy suit, black dress shoes and a conservative power tie.
Don't forget the "Thank You Letter". It's a professional courtesy to write a thank you letter addressed to your interviewers. Get their names before you leave, and make sure to take the time to write one.

 You may have several breeding locations to choose from, depending on how far in the game you are.;
, This will allow you to select the two dragons you want to breed.
 Below are some of the most effective combinations to get a Sky Dragon. Note that even the best combinations only have about a 10% chance of success, so you'll probably need to try multiple times. Also note that your two parent dragons will need to be at or above a specific level:

Parent 1
Parent 2
 Parent Level 


Terra
Electric
19


Cactus
Electric
20


Uncle Sam
Terra

 Double Terra 
 Double Electric

There are other combinations as well, but these offer the best chances.
 A Sky Dragon will take 20 hours to breed. If you get a shorter time, there's a good chance it won't be a Sky Dragon.
 Once the breeding has finished, you will see the egg in your Hatchery. You will need to wait another 20 hours in order for the egg to hatch. Tap "Hatch" when it is ready.

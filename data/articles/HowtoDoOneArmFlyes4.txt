 Taking the time to reflect on why you want to do one arm flyes versus double arm flyes may be helpful. It is more common for people to do double arm flyes, but you might have some specific reasons for wanting to do one arm flyes.

For example, you might need to do one arm flyes due to an injury on one side.
You might also want to isolate your muscles as you work them. You can take more time to focus on isolating your shoulder muscles when you are doing one arm flyes.
 Flyes are often done with hand weights. When you begin, you should use low weights. Flyes can be difficult for some people, especially if you are new to exercising. Start by doing flyes with a small weight, such as five pounds, and increase from there.









If you cannot use five pounds, you can try two pounds, or do flyes without any weight at all.
 Break it down into sets and reps. You may want to do 3 sets of 10 reps, 2 sets of 15 reps, or another reasonable number. Consider keeping the total number of reps under 50.









You may want to combine chest and back flyes with other arm exercises, like curls, presses, or push ups.
 You need to decide how often you want to perform this exercise. Most exercise plans suggest doing three days of strength training with a day of rest in between. You shouldnâ€™t do strength training two days in a row of the same muscle.


You may want to choose to work a different muscle group on your flye off days.

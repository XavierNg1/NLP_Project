, baking potatoes in half lengthwise.
 Poke each potato with a fork a few times. This will help them cook in the microwave.
 Wrap the potatoes in a wet paper towel and microwave them. It takes about 5 minutes to microwave a single potato, and about 10 minutes to microwave 3 potatoes. Place several potatoes on a plate at a time and keep checking to see when the potatoes are baked through by poking them with a fork.
 Take off the wet paper towel and wait for them to cool.
 Use a sturdy spoon to scrape out the inside of the potato, leaving only the skin and a thin layer of potato. If you scrape out the insides too much, you can tear the skin of the potato, which will make it more difficult for the potato to hold the ingredients later.
 Combine 2 cups of grated cheddar cheese, 1 bunch of diced green onions, and 4 tablespoon (59.1Â ml). bacon bits with the potato insides in a bowl. Stir well until the ingredients are blended.
 Add salt and pepper to the mixture to taste.
 This will let them get a bit crisp.
 Bake the potato skins and insides together in the oven for at least 20 minutes. Check on them to make sure that the cheddar cheese doesn't burn. When they're ready, the skins will be nice and crispy and the insides will be tasty and brown.
 Remove the skins from the oven and let them cool for at least 5 minutes. Then serve them with either 1 cup of sour cream on the side, or with a dollop of sour cream on each potato skin. They're also delicious with a glass of beer.

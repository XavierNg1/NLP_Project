 If you no longer have use for an album, you can safely delete it without deleting the photos inside. Start by launching the app on your mobile device or visiting Google Photos in a web browser., It’s at the bottom of the mobile app, and on the left side of the website. The icon looks like a square with a bookmark at its upper-right edge. Once clicked or tapped, a list of your albums will appear.
 The contents of the album will appear.
 It’s at the top right corner of both the website and the mobile app.
 Remember: the photos inside the album will not be deleted—just their container.

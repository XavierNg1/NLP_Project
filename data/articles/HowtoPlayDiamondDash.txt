 You can play Diamond Dash on your computer through Facebook, or on your iOS and Android mobile devices. You can download the app for free from your device’s app store.


Opening Diamond Dash in Facebook—Once logged into your Facebook account, you can access the game link under the Apps section on the left panel of your Facebook News Feed page. Click Diamond Dash from here and the game will load.
Opening the mobile app—Locate the app on your mobile device. The app logo has a red and blue split diamond on it. Tap on it and the app will load.;
, The game board will load filled with colorful diamonds. You are given 60 seconds to match as many gems as you can.
 The simplest match you can make is a connection of three similar gems. They don’t need to be in one row or column. As long as they’re connected, you can match and clear them. Click or tap on the gems you want to clear.
 You only have 60 seconds per game. Work fast on matching the gems. The timer is visible on your screen so you can see how much time you have left. Once the time is up, the game will end and your score will be shown.
 Matching three similar gems at a time will be slow, and you won’t get huge scores. The key to getting a high score in the game is to match long connected gems. Look for them, and try to build large chains. The longer the connection of similar-colored gems, the higher the scores you can get.
 Make your matches as fast as you can and make every click or tap count. You will be rewarded with the Fire Mode. When activated, the borders of the board will be on fire, and every match you make will explode and give you more points.
 Each match you make increases the Diamond meter on your screen. If you take some time between moves, the meter will slightly go down. It will also go down if you click or tap on an invalid match. Once the meter reaches the maximum, you will be rewarded with a magic diamond on the board. Clicking or tapping on it will clear a full row and a full column of gems.

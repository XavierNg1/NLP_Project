 In general, the least toxic cleaner is best for cement. Start with a mild cleanser, like detergent, and work your way up to chemical cleaners if necessary. Chemicals can wear cement down, so they should be avoided unless absolutely necessary., When using an acid-based cleaner, never pour add the acid to a bucket first and then the water. You should add the water followed by the acid. Doing so the other way around can cause a dangerous reaction., Many people use push brooms to target cement floors. However, push brushes are actually less effective than deck brushes. The bristles are too long to effectively remove dirt and debris from cement.If you don't have a deck brush, buy one at a hardware store.

 As the kids are making their crafts, walk around the room and ask everyone how they are doing. This will let the kids know you are there to help them if necessary. You can also let the kids know you are ready to refill supplies if they run out., If your guests’ parents are staying for the craft party, ask them to help out. You can assign them different roles, like refilling supply stations or checking in with individual kids to make sure their crafting is going smoothly., You can have even more fun at a kids’ craft party by playing games. This is a great way to spend time in between craft steps, like while the kids are waiting for the glue to dry. Try a game like musical chairs or duck, duck, goose. For older kids, try a game like pin the tail on the donkey., You don’t want the party to go on too long, so it’s important that there is an end time. For example, if you are hosting a group of 3-year-olds, an hour will generally be long enough for the craft party. A group of 4-6 years olds, on the other hand, can enjoy a party that lasts a couple of hours.

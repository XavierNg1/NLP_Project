 As long as you do not cut the pineapple, it should stay fresh for several days. Do not leave cut pineapple out in a room temperature setting, however, since it will spoil after a few hours.
 A whole refrigerated pineapple, when left uncut, can last about two weeks. Once you cut the pineapple or remove its skin, it will only last for about one week in your refrigerator.
 To properly cut your pineapple, cut off the crown and the base of the fruit. Place the pineapple upright on a cutting board and carefully slice on the inside of the rind from top to bottom. Make sure to cut deep enough to remove all of the prickly rind.The pineapple will still have its "eyes" at this point. You can cut them away individually, but it might be easier to cut along the sides of the pineapple in a diagonal, v-shaped trench since the eyes should be patterned along the sides in a diagonal.Cut the pineapple in half lengthwise and then in half again so that you have four triangle-shaped quarters.






Cut the tough core out of the center and discard, then slice the four pieces into chunks or slices.
 Slice the pineapples in large chunks to retain as much flavor as possible, as freezing can cause pineapples to lose flavor. Place the pineapple chunks in freezer-safe plastic containers or freezer-safe plastic bags before storing.When you're ready to use the pineapple, simply remove it from the freezer and let it thaw in your refrigerator or at room temperature before use.

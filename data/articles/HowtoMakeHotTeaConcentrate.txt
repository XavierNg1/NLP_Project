 Measure out 2/3 cup of loose tea into a canning jar. Good quality, organic tea is the best. Some yummy suggestions would be, Assam, Oolong, or Lapsang Souchong. Most people think that Lapsang is too smokey but once you acquire a taste for it you will love it.In fact, it was the favorite tea of a few famous people including Winston Churchill and Julia Child!;
, Let this stand for about 5 minutes. Then stir and strain the tea concentrate into another heat proof jar so the tea doesn't stew.
 Drink plain or add cream and sugar to taste.
 This will keep for at least a week in the refrigerator, but if you leave it out it will sour. It is meant for large gatherings, but if you have leftovers refrigerate them and enjoy a special cup of tea yourself later on.
 One quart of this will also make one gallon of cold tea so if you don't use it all up make cold tea and enjoy when the heat of the day attacks!

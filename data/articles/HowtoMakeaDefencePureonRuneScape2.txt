 some notable ones include:

Red Topaz Machete






Bone Spear






Dagger(P++)






Iron Spear (Kp).
 It's the fastest XP you can get, and it won't level up your hitpoints.
 Kill them. They each have 50 hitpoints. This spot can become very crowded.
 If you can't afford everything you want, you may want to take some time off defense to do some skilling.

If you're mega rich, then at 65 defense, you can buy Bandos or 3rd Age armor.
 These have some of the highest defense ratings in the game, and are less expensive than dragon, Bandos, and 3rd Age.
 This shield is extremely expensive, but can be your lifeline in a duel or fight. In addition to its high defense bonuses, it has a special attack, that hits up to 250 damage points. Be careful, using the special on a monster or familiar will give you magic XP, which will increase your combat level! Using it on another player however, will not.
 Once you hit 40 combat, members will be able to play pest control. It is advised using this method as it is much better experience. Good luck!

 While your back is lifted off the mat, bring your legs over your buttocks and stretch them so your feet are pointing towards the front of the mat. Position yourself by using your hands to support your lower back.
 Bend your right knee completely so that your right leg forms a V with your right thigh.
 Meanwhile extend your left knee. This motion essentially allows the legs to trade places. The motion is similar to riding a bicycle. Repeat the exercise for the desired number of times.

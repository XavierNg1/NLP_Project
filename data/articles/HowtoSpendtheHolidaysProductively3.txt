 Plan family outings, like skiing, skating, snowshoeing, sledding or swimming, that are exercise oriented.
 Accept that your hectic holiday schedule will change your availability to exercise. Fitness should be a priority, but you are more likely to do it if it doesn't interrupt fun activities.


Avoid signing up for fitness classes during late November and December, but choose an activity like hiking, walking or swimming that can be done at any time of the day.
Replace evening workouts with morning or lunch workouts. Most holiday parties and children's activities take place after school or work. Just as you are more productive at work in the morning, you are also likely to exercise more if you do it earlier in the day, before other things come up.
When you don't have time to do anything else, walk. Plan a 30 minute walk after dinner or in place of a television show. Try to stay as active as possible to avoid weight gain, sleeplessness and even depression.
Create an at-home routine, in case you don't have time to go to the gym. You can include free-weights, crunches, yoga poses and pilates moves that target the same areas. Lay out a mat and exercise for 15 to 20 minute each morning.

,


Immediately beneath it says 'Create a List'. Click here to get started.
 This can be related to a particular theme. To come up with a theme, think about


Time of year. Are there any particular holidays approaching?
Color schemes. Are there any trending color schemes you like? Look to fashion magazines, design shows or Pinterest for ideas.
Cultural influences. Maybe a geeky, Doctor Who vibe. Or a hipster collection with lots of dark eyeglass frames and moustaches. Let your creativity flow!

, This is where you can talk a little bit about what inspired your collection. I also like to use this area to remind people to click on the items and favorite those they like. This will move the Treasury further up the list and help it get more views.
 It is clear where the images will appear. The spots are represented by the gray boxes. Underneath each box is box labeled 'Listing URL'.


Type in the listing number of each item. This is found on the item page, in the URL. It should say 'www.etsy.com/listing/xxxxxxxxx...' The Xs represent a series of numbers to be typed into the Listing URL box.
If you change you mind and would like to remove an item, simply hover over the image and click 'remove'.
To change the position of the items in the Treasury, simply drag and drop until you are satisfied.
, Think of the following when coming up with tags.

For simplicity, it may be best to create your first repository folder on the Desktop.
 This program is installed along with the git tools, however you can also use the natively installed Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)., Enter the “cd” command following by the path to the repository folder you created. Folders in the path are separated by “\”. Hit ↵ Enter to complete the action.

For example, a folder on the desktop for Windows would use the command “cd c:\users\\desktop\”
“cd” stands for “change directory”
You can change directories one at a time instead of all at once if you find it faster to type: “cd desktop” ↵ Enter “cd folder name” ↵ Enter.
 Go to the github (or whichever git alternative) page of the repository you are trying to clone. The source location of the repository will be displayed on the repository page.

The exact location of the source location will vary depending on which repository site you are using, but they are usually located near the top for easy access. Look for a URL.
 Click the source location (typically a URL starting with “https” or “ssh”) and hit Ctrl+C or ⌘ Cmd+C to copy., The “git” command tells the command line you are using a Git function, and “clone” tells it to clone the location following the command. Paste or type out the source location after the command.

In order to paste into the Windows command line, you have to right-click and select “Paste” from the context menu. This is not necessary in the Mac or Linux Terminal.
 The cloning process will begin and display its progress in the command line. You will be notified when the process in completed by a message in the command line.

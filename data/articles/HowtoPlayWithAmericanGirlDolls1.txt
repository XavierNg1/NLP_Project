 Teach your doll math, reading, science, social studies, etc. Give them spelling papers or math tests so it will be more fun. You can also hold fire drills and tornado drills like in a real school. And you can make her a locker and desk. You can use your own schoolwork and make copies and teach your AG doll what you are learning (if you have a printer).


Use a dry erase board (if you have one). If you don't, you can draw on something thick or a piece of cardboard.;

, Pick up the handkerchief.
 With your free hand grip around the handkerchief beneath your pinching hand, and gently pull the cloth downwards.
 Holding the handkerchief secure with your bottom hand, fold that top section (that you were pinching) down towards the center.
 The four ends should now be at the top, with your fold base at the bottom.
 Adjust the tops to your liking.

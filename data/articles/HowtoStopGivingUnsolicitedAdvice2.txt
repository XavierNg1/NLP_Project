 If you are in a face to face conversation, face the person, maintain eye contact and listen with an open mind to what they are saying. Likewise, if you are on the phone, listen attentively with an open mind. Try to just comprehend what they are saying.If you are having a hard time concentrating, try repeating their words in your mind.Rather than going on to offer unsolicited advice, you should continue trying to understand their situation in greater depth through active listening. Only offer advice if they directly ask you for it., To assure them that you are actively listening to their story, you can nod your head in affirmation. You could also say, “uh huh.” Where appropriate, you can offer affirmations such as “thanks for sharing” or “that makes sense.”, If your intention is to make friends, perhaps you should try simply listening to the person. If you offer unsolicited advice, they may react negatively and it could defeat your purpose. Instead of offering advice, try listening and then making empathetic nods or making the following kinds of statements:“I understand, tell me more”
“That sounds hard, I’m sorry to hear you had that experience”

, After they have finished speaking, you could try making a comment or question for the purpose of recapping what they have said. This will ensure you have understood them correctly. Try recapping and then asking if your recap of their story is a correct interpretation:“What I understand from what you have just told me is that you feel terribly about what happened to John and you want to do something about it. Do I understand you correctly?”
“From what I understand, you really want to fix your relationship with Sue, which seems to have gone south since Christmas. And the issue seems to be partly the long distance but also these other things you were talking about. Am I getting this right?”

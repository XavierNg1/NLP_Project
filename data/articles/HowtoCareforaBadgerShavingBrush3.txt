 Dip the tip of the brush into the shaving cream or soap (you can use a shaving bowl). Lather gently using a light circular or up-and-down motion. When applying the shaving cream or soap, avoid applying so much pressure that the badger hair splays - be gentle.
 After shaving, rinse the brush gently but thoroughly in clean, warm water.
 If you do not have a stand, leave the brush pointing out rather than horizontal, so that air can get to all hairs and dry the brush naturally.
 Natural hair that is left wet can develop mildew; try to avoid enclosing a wet brush in a too small space.


If you keep it in the bathroom cabinet, make sure that it has sufficient space to dry.
If you shave away from home and keep your shaving brush in a travel tube or kit bag, give it an opportunity to dry as soon as you can.
 If your brush becomes affected by mildew or a build-up of soap, soak it in a solution of borax, which can be obtained from a pharmacy.

 The FILO method operates on the basis that the most recent inventory acquisitions will be the first sold. You will still need to do an inventory count at the beginning and end of the period.
 You can refer to the invoices sent by the vendors. The costs may vary even if it is all the same kind of inventory.


Again imagine you stocked your inventory with 10 widgets at $1 each on Monday and another 10 at $1.50 each on Friday. By Saturday you sold 15 widgets.
 This time COGS would be all 10 of the widgets purchased at $1.50 each (sold first under FILO) (10 x $1.50 = $15.00). Then add 5 of the widgets purchased for $1 each (5 x $1 = $5) sold last for a total COGS of $20. When the remaining inventory (5 widgets) gets sold, COGS for that will be $5 (5 x $1). Companies use the FILO method when they carry large inventories with increasing costs. This method can result in lower profits and therefore lower taxes.

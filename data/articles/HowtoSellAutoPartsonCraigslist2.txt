Use short paragraphs within your post. Short paragraphs that consist of 2 or 3 sentences may be easier to read and look more appealing to buyers than long, block-style paragraphs.
Give a brief history of the auto parts; such as where they came from, how long you have had them, and why you are selling them. This will help gain the trust of your potential buyers.
Provide honest information about your auto parts. Buyers may not follow through with the sale if they arrive to look at the auto parts and see that components are broken or missing or that the information you provided was misleading.
Include as many details as you can about your auto parts in the posting. This may prevent potential buyers from making additional inquiries if you do not provide enough information, such as the year or model of the auto part.
 You can renew your posting every 7 days when you log into your Craigslist account.

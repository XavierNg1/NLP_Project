 These are listed below under "Things You'll Need".
 Where the eggs don't cover up, this is what will be noticed. Pin into place.
 Plan out the pattern for placing the eggs around the wreath before you start gluing them on. The specific arrangement will be dependent on a few things:

Color scheme: You might like to arrange the eggs so that they're all certain colors, one color, a pattern of colors, etc.






Size: If you only have one size of artificial egg, this won't be an issue. However, if you've purchased big, medium and small eggs, you might like to create a cascading effect that has the egg arrangement descending from large eggs on the outside to smaller ones on the inside.






Placement of other Easter items: If you're also inserting other Easter decorative elements, plan these in now. They might be inserted in between the eggs, or stuck on top of them.
 Use the ribbon to make a loop for hanging. This now becomes the top of the wreath.
 Add any embellishments at this stage too.


If you have a sign that says "Easter" or has a bunny/chick, etc. on it, this could be glued into the center of the wreath, or added wherever it looks best. Just be careful to ensure good balance.
 It can go on the front door, over a mantelpiece or anywhere in the house where it would add to the festive flavor.

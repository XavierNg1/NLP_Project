 Look for the Google Earth app on your mobile device and tap on it. The app icon has a blue sphere with white lines on it.


Once the app has opened, you will see a beautiful 3-D rendition of our world.
 Use the search field on the upper right corner and enter the place you want to view. Tap the Search button on your keypad to proceed.


Just like in Google Maps, Google Earth will bring you to the location you’ve entered.
 Since you can touch your screen, your fingers will act as your navigation tools. Use two fingers to touch two points on the map, and then move them away from each other. This will expand the map and zoom in on the point you’ve chosen. The map will immediately adjust as you zoom.


Sliding your fingers toward each other will zoom out.

 Birth is always messy. Whelping means not only new puppies, but amniotic fluid, placental sacs, and umbilical cords, all of which have their own unique juices. These birth liquids are difficult to get out of matted dog hair. You can easily avoid the unpleasant task of scrubbing your dog’s rear legs and tail by trimming the hair in that area at least a few days before labor is expected.Use your knowledge of how far along your dog is in its pregnancy to determine when to trim it. Remove hair in the area of the vulva, the rear legs, and tail.
 In case your dog has trouble getting its puppies out and going to the vet isn’t an option, you should be ready to intervene on your dog’s behalf. Collect three or four pairs of sterile hemostat forceps, sutures, a tube of lubricating jelly, a small bottle of povidone iodine solution, and your whelping manual.These common medical supplies can be obtained online or at your local pharmacy. Forceps might need to be obtained through a larger big-box store or through your local medical supply company.
In the event that you need to remove a pup from your dog, consult your whelping manual or call your vet and have them walk you through it.
You might also want to get a book or deck of cards for yourself so you have something to do while waiting for your dog to deliver.
 In the early stages of labor, your dog might pace, shiver, dig, or vomit. This might last six to 12 hours, after which your dog’s amniotic sac – a gray balloon-like bulb, also known as the placental sac – will emerge from your dog’s vulva. The sac will appear small at first, then grow in size. Eventually the dog’s puppies will slide into this sac, at which point the mother will nibble at it to deflate it.

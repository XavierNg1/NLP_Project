If you believe you cannot afford the multiple fees to get a governor's pardon, you can file an application to have the fees waived. Keep in mind the Board rarely waives fees unless the applicant is currently in prison.;
, Because it can take several months to receive the required documents after you request them, you should start this process as soon as possible after you've downloaded your application.The instructions for filling out your application contain a list of documents you must submit along with your application. If anything is missing, your application won't be filed and you'll have to send it again after you've obtained the missing documents or information.One of the documents that must be included with your application is your complete criminal history from the Pennsylvania State Police. You will have to pay a fee of $10 to get your history, and it may take as long as six months to process your request.You also must include a copy of your certified driving record and a color, passport-sized photo.In addition to the required documents, you may want to include other documents related to your rehabilitation and your current life.

You must provide specific details about the conviction for which you're requesting a pardon, including the date of the crime, the place where you were tried, and the name of the judge. You can get this information by visiting the clerk's office of the courthouse in the county where you were tried.
In addition to details about the crime, make sure you provide details about your conduct since your conviction, with emphasis on positive changes you've made in your life and any efforts at rehabilitation.The application requires you to provide general information about yourself and your employment. If you're not employed, be prepared to explain how you support yourself financially.Although the Board doesn't have any specific eligibility requirements for individuals seeking pardons, you generally must be able to demonstrate that a sufficient period of time has passed since the conviction for you to be rehabilitated, and that you've completed all court-imposed requirements associated with the conviction for which you're seeking a pardon.You should have a specific reason you need a pardon, such as a particular job or activity that you cannot complete without it. The Board generally doesn't approve application if you have a general reason or want to restore certain licenses or privileges that you lost as a result of your conviction., Once you finish your application, you must make five copies and send the entire package of documents to the Board.Your application must be accompanied by a certified check or money order for $25 to cover the filing fees., The Board reviews your application to determine whether it is complete and accurate. If it is, you will receive confirmation that your application has been officially filed.Assuming your application is complete, you can expect it to be filed within two to three months of the date it was received.After your application is filed, the Board will send copies of your application to the Board of Probation and Parole, the Department of Corrections, and the District Attorney and sentencing judge in the county where the crime occurred., After your application has been filed, a state parole agent will investigate your case and prepare a report.As part of this investigation, he or she will interview you in your home and collect information about your life.The interview typically takes place about two years after your application is filed, so you have plenty of time to gather the information and documentation you'll need.You will need to have supporting documents for the investigating agent, including any documents such as birth or death certificates, marriage certificates, or divorce decrees that relate to your marital status and family composition.Financial documents and information you should collect include pay stubs, W2s, and other evidence of employment, loan and credit card statements, rental agreements or mortgage statements, and bank or investment statements along with valuations of any assets you have.Additionally, you should gather documents or information related to your membership in any organizations or religious institutions, community references, and your educational history., A state parole agent will ask you questions about your personal life and your conduct after your conviction.Make sure to highlight any positive activities in which you've participated, including community service, military service, and your religious or community involvement.Keep in mind that the agent will prepare a report for the Board based on your interview, so be polite and cooperative. If you're uncomfortable with any of the questions the agent asks, you should explain what it is about the question that makes you uneasy, but try to answer all questions as honestly and completely as you can., The Board has five members, including the lieutenant governor, the attorney general, a victim representative, a corrections expert, and a psychologist.Typically you'll have to wait about one year for a Board decision on your application. At least two Board members must vote in your favor for you to be granted a hearing.If the Board decides to grant you a hearing, you will receive a notification telling you when the hearing is scheduled. The Board also will send notice of the hearing to the Board of Probation and Parole, the Department of Corrections, the District Attorney and judge in the county where the crime occurred, and any victims or survivors.At least one week before your hearing is scheduled, a public notice will appear in a newspaper located in the county where the crime occurred. The notice will provide your name, the crime for which you've requested a pardon, and the time and location of the hearing., If you are granted a hearing, it will occur within a few months after the Board reviews your application.Because you only have a brief period of time to present your case, you should outline what you plan to say to the Board and practice your speech several times. Stick to the facts and keep your presentation short, but detailed.
You also might consider bringing along witnesses to speak in support of your application for a pardon. Having witnesses may be particularly helpful if you know there will be others speaking who are opposed to your application.
 Although you don't need an attorney to represent you at your hearing, a criminal attorney with experience in expungements and pardons can increase your chances of success.If you're concerned about your ability to afford a private attorney, you might want to check for clinics or community legal services programs in your area that provide free or reduced-cost legal assistance for low-income individuals.However, keep in mind that having an attorney won't do anything to speed up the process. It still may take several years to receive your pardon, regardless of whether you have legal representation., All pardon hearings are public, and are held in the Supreme Court Courtroom in Harrisburg.You must attend your hearing in person. Although you will be expected to speak for yourself, you may bring others to testify on your behalf.Each day hearings are held, the Board holds two sessions: a morning session beginning at 9:00 a.m. and an afternoon session beginning at 1:00 p.m. You must be present at the beginning of your session. Cases will be called sequentially in the order they are listed on the Board's calendar., When your case is called, you have the opportunity to explain your position to the Board and tell them why you believe you should be granted a pardon for your crime.Typically you will have no more than 15 minutes to present your case to the Board.If you've brought witnesses to speak in support of your application, they will have an opportunity to speak after you've made your presentation.Depending on the crime for which you're seeking a pardon, there also may be presentations from the victim, the victim's family, or anyone else who opposes you getting a pardon., After you've presented your case, Board members will ask you questions regarding the crime for which you're seeking a pardon, any other arrests or convictions on your record.


The Board also will seek assurance that you have remorse for committing the crime, and won't commit any more crimes in the future., At the end of the day, the Board members will vote on all hearings held that day.


The Board meets privately after each public hearing session, then reconvenes to have the public vote.Generally, at least three of the Board members must vote in your favor for the Board to send a recommendation to the governor that you be granted a pardon.For life in prison or death penalty commutation cases, the Board's vote must be unanimous before a recommendation for a pardon is sent to the governor., Although the governor typically follows the recommendation of the Board, he or she has full discretion in whether to grant a pardon.It can take up to a year after your hearing for the governor to make a decision regarding your application.The governor will send his or her decision to the Secretary of the Board, who notifies all interested parties.If the governor decides to grant your pardon, you will receive a signed certificate in the mail.Your pardon restores any legal rights that you lost as a result of your conviction, including your right to vote, serve on a jury, carry a firearm, and hold public office., After you receive a pardon, you must file a petition in the court where you were convicted to have your record expunged.The pardon does not expunge your record, it only grants you the right to have your record expunged.Within two to six months after the judge orders your record expunged, the crime for which you received a pardon will be removed from court and state police records.After your record is cleared, you can legally and honestly tell people that you were never convicted of a crime.

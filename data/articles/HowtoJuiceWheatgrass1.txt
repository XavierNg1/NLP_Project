 (1 1/4-cm.) above the ground. Use a clean knife or pair of scissors. The blades should be about 8 inches (20 1/3 cm.) tall, having grown for about a week after the wheat grains were sown. If you're not growing your own wheatgrass, you can purchase it in a health food store or some grocery stores.
 Place the wheatgrass blades inside a strainer and run cool to lukewarm tap water over the grass and through the strainer to remove any dirt, insects, or bacteria.
 Place the wheatgrass on a cutting board and give the blades a rough chop. The smaller the pieces are, the easier it will be to grind or blend them and create the juice.
 You can work in smaller or larger batches, if desired, but this amount should be enough for about two servings. This will be enough to give you a healthy dose of all of the wonderful properties that wheatgrass has in store for you.

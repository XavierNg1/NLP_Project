 The symptoms of whipworms depend on how many worms the dog has. With a mild infection, the dog may not show any signs of ill health. With a more severe infection, the worms damage the wall of the large intestine as they suck blood, leading to inflammation. This can present as diarrhea, or feces streaked with blood and containing mucus.In the worst cases, the dog may hemorrhage and die from dehydration and blood loss.
The parasite infects the large intestine, which is distant from the stomach, so vomiting because of this parasite is rare.
 If you think your dog has whipworms, take him to the vet. The vet can take a stool sample and check it for whipworm eggs. If your dog has whipworms, your vet can prescribe a medicine that will kill the parasites.The medicine your vet prescribes is more effective at killing whipworms than medications you can buy in the store.
Even if your dog doesnâ€™t have whipworms, your vet may give him dewormer medicine just in case.
You should take your dog to the vet annually to check for parasites, such as whipworms.
 A dog gets whipworms by ingesting whipworm eggs. The eggs have to be at a certain stage of development inside the egg for the dog to get infected. This means that eggs in fresh feces are not infectious. Instead, it takes a delay of around nine to 21 days to embryonate and become infectious.Eggs are extremely tough and can survive in the environment for years, despite extremes of temperature such as freezing.
 Once your dog becomes infected by ingesting an infected egg, the embryonated eggs hatch inside the dog's gut and become larvae. These larvae burrow deep into the mucosal lining of the bowel, and eventually mature into adult whipworms.This process can take 74 to 90 days. Prior to this time, the dog may test negative for whipworm, despite being infected, since the worms are not mature enough to shed eggs.

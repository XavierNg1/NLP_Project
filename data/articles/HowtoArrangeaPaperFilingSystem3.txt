 One way to ensure your filing system runs efficiently is by filing paper as you process it.The filing system is not going to work if you put off filing papers. Getting into the habit of filing papers will also help your productivity and workflow.
 Every couple of months you should go through your filing system and do a brief sweep. You arenâ€™t required to review all your papers like you did for the initial organization. Check through all files and make sure everything is organized and in the right place.


After the first few months you could also reflect if the system you choose is working for you.
 Once a year you should do a larger cleaning of your workspace. You might have some files that you regularly use, but you should now go through the other files you use less.Open the files you use less and read through all your documents to see if there is any unnecessary paperwork.


Take out all the files and wipe down the filing cabinet with a damp washcloth to remove dust buildup.

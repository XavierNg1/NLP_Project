 To open the Spotify application, look for its icon on your desktop or in your Downloads folder. The icon is a green circle with three black lines. When you find it, double-click on it.;
, Launching Spotify will land you on the login screen on which you will see two text boxes. Enter your username and password into them, and then click on the green login button to open your account so you can adjust your sound quality settings.
 Once you are signed into your account, look at the menus at the top of the screen. The first one is “File,” and the other is “Edit.” Click on the latter to open its drop-down menu.
 The very last option under Edit is Preferences. Click on that to load its own settings options in the center of the screen.
 When you see the settings under Preferences, scroll down until you see the subheading “Playback” under which you will see “High Quality Streaming.” Check the tickbox next to it to enjoy the best possible quality while you stream and download music.

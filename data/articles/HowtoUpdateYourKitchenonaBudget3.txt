 Countertop kits make the job easy to do on your own and are relatively inexpensive. You can use acrylic craft paints and high gloss sealers to make the counters look as close to granite as possible for a fraction of the cost of real granite.
 Concrete can be a little difficult if you are new to working with it and you may not want to use it for your countertops if it is your first time working with concrete. If you feel confident in your DIY abilities, however, concrete is a versatile and affordable option.
 Butcher block countertops are made of thick slabs of wood. You can buy the wood at a hardware store, or you can also find inexpensive butcher block countertops from various home furnishing stores. The countertops can also be installed without the use of professional help.
 Laminate might be a bit more expensive than paint or concrete, but thanks to the numerous patterns and styles available, it makes a fantastic way to update your kitchen. Laminate is also easy to clean and install, and it is much cheaper than marble or granite.

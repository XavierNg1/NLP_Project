 Fresh shrimp does not store well, and you should sauté it within 24 hours. Most grocery stores sell frozen shrimp that they have thawed, and these shrimp should be cooked within 2 to 3 days.


Look for fresh shrimp that has transparent skin and smells like salt water. Unless you are buying tiger shrimp, avoid specimens with dark rings or spots. Dark rings or spots may indicate that the shrimp is going bad.
Choose frozen shrimp that has not been peeled or deveined. It's more work to peel the shrimp yourself, but when preparing shrimp, you want to preserve the flavor. The shrimp shell encases the full flavor of the meat, so pre-prepared shrimp loses some of its taste.;
, 1 serving of shrimp consists of 4 oz. (.113 kg) to 8 oz. (.226 kg), and 1 lb. (.454 kg) of shelled fresh or frozen shrimp will become 1/2 lb. (.226 kg) of sautéed shrimp. When sautéing shrimp, you will lose some of the weight when you peel the shrimp, and the heat will cook out some of the moisture, shrinking the meat.

 A psychopath may end a conversation with a statement that opposes what they said at the beginning. Dishonesty and pathological lying is a sign of psychopathy.The person may talk about how disrespectful it is that your coworker always shows up late and does things they are not supposed to, and then moments later the person will break the rules without apology.The contradictions may not occur within the same conversation, so keep track of what is said over time. Log in a journal important information that you think might later be contradicted.;
, Psychopaths talk excessively about the people in their lives because they view them as extensions of themselves. A psychopath will lie about the people in their life; they will even lie about their children. Psychopaths are prone to giving out half-truths or disinformation. They have no problem keeping important information away from you.
If the person has told you stories of betrayal or tragedy to explain their damaged family, friend, or romantic relationships, see if you can verify these stories independently.
 A psychopath refuses to take responsibility for their own actions and will blame others for things they have done.If there is irrefutable evidence that they are at fault, they may then admit it, but will show no remorse.A psychopath will also try very hard to control the narrative by professing an altered version of events, which may be very different from what you experienced. This can cause you to question yourself and is known as "gaslighting."
On the other hand, because the psychopath displays a grandiose sense of self-worth, they may brag about or inflate their achievements, or even take credit for the work of others., Notice if they quickly and smoothly change topics when you broach a subject that might reveal their anti-sociality. They may rapidly dismiss discussions of their odd behavior by accusing you of causing too much drama, or by insisting that you are mentally ill and need professional help.

 Even though horses are known to kill more humans than bulls, the most docile bulls tend to be the most dangerous, because you won't know when they will suddenly turn on you.

Never make a pet out of a bull. Bottle-fed bulls tend to be the most dangerous, or any bull calf that has been made into a pet or "humanized", like dogs and cats often get treated. In making a pet out of a bull calf, you are unknowingly teaching it to connect more readily with humans than with other cattle. Thus "bull people" or "bull humans" are confused bulls, quite often feeling that they have to assert their dominance over humans and interact with humans, not others of their kind. This is what makes them dangerous.

"Pet" bulls that are made into pets but treated with respect and like they are bovines, not humans, can still pose a threat just like any other bovine, but less-so than a bull that thinks it is a human.


Cows shouldn't be trusted either, especially around calving time. A cow can get aggressive around her new calf if you are not careful nor respectful of what she's trying to communicate to you.
 Horses are actually the most dangerous livestock animal, with more accidents and deaths occurring around these magnificent, dramatic animals than the horror stories involved with charging bulls or angry, over-protective cows.

If riding, know how to ride. Always pay attention to good horse handling practices, such as staying in the horse's sight, not walking behind a horse within kicking range or provoking a horse with unfamiliar things.
 Any other livestock animal can pose a danger to injury to a person if the person is not careful, respectful or considerate of how they treat or handle those animals. Turning any farm animal of medium to large size into a pet brings risks for the same reasons described above––for example, pet sheep have been known to chase and knock over smaller humans, hurting them and trampling on them. Always be cautious, calm and gradual around animals.

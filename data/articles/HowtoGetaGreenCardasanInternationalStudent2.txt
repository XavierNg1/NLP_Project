 This is probably the easiest way to get a green card.


Although this method is easy, it can carry a lot of dangers. You will be asked several questions like how you met one one another, intimate details of your lives, if you have any children, if your spouse's family knows about you etc.
The main thing to note here is to have a real marriage and to only marry the U.S. citizen if you love him/her. Otherwise, you may face grave legal consequences.
Always consult with a reputable lawyer before filling out any immigration papers.

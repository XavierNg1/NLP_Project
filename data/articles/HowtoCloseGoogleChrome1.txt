 This button is a number (reflecting the number of tabs you have open) inside of a square and is located in the upper right corner between the search bar and the menu button.


The mobile Chrome app does not support multiple windows, only tabs.
Tablets will display tabs similarly to the desktop interface and will not use the tab display button.;
,, Alternately, you can open the Settings menu (vertical ellipses) after opening tab display and select “Close All Tabs” from the list.
 If you turn off the screen (power button) with an incognito tab open, you will see a “Close Incognito Tabs” notification when turning the screen back on. Double tap this notification and you will be returned to the home screen with all incognito tabs closed.


Incognito tabs can also be closed using the same methods as regular tabs.

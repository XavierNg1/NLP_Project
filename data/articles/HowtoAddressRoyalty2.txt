 If you're writing a letter to royalty, your salutation needs to be slightly more formal than a regular letter. Your salutation should have two lines.On the first line, begin with "Unto" and then include the appropriate title of address. For example, if you're writing to the queen of England, your first line would read, "Unto Her Majesty, the Queen of England."
The second line should state who you are. A letter to royalty should not withhold the letter writer's name until the signature. If you have any titles, include them here. For example, "Lord John Smith of Scotland sends greetings."

, How you address the envelope is also important. Addressing the envelope in an improper fashion can show disrespect. You have to use royal titles on the envelope as well. Do not simply write the name of the queen. Write the title instead. For example, write "Her Majesty the Queen" on the envelope., You want to add some formality when signing your name. A regular signature, where you would use a term like "sincerely," is not appropriate when addressing royalty.For high ranking officials, like kings, queens, princes, princesses, and emperors, use something very formal before your signature. Usually, you would write something like, "I have the honor to remain Your Majesty's most humble and obedient servant."
For other forms of royalty, "Yours faithfully" is usually sufficient.

 Try to use eggs that are at least 7 to 10 days old. Many people find that the fresher an egg is, the more difficult it is to peel.







;
, Whatever you use, make sure that the eggs are under 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water. If you don't use enough water, the eggs may not cook evenly.
 This will help the eggs cook slowly at first. They will continue to cook, even after you turn the heat off later on.
 Keep the saucepan on the burner during this time. The heat from the burner will continue "cooking" the eggs. If your burner doesn't stay hot after you turn it off (such as gas), reduce the heat to low, simmer for 1 minute, then turn it off.








If the eggs are small or medium-sized, cook them for 11 minutes.
If the eggs are large or extra large, cook them for 13 minutes., Fill a large bowl with cold water and lots of ice. When you put the eggs into this, the coldness will "shock" the eggs, and make the shell easier to peel off.
 Use a slotted spoon or a pair of tongs to lift the eggs out of the water and place them into the bowl. During this time, the eggs will cool down; cold eggs are easier to peel than hot eggs.
 Keep the bowl of water handy. You can dip the eggs into the water once you peel them to get rid of any broken shell bits.
 Try to crack both ends of the shell first, as this is where the air pockets tend to be. To make the shell even easier to peel, roll the egg across the counter with your palm. This will help loosen the membrane from the whites., From time to time, dip the egg into the cold water. This will help loosen the shell from the whites even more. It will also help rinse away any broken shell fragments that might be stuck the to whites.
 At this point, you can use the eggs in your recipe, or you can store them in a sealed container in your fridge. If you do store them, be sure to eat them within 3 to 5 days.

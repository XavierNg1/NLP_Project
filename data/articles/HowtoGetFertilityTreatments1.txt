 A doctor will evaluate the lifestyle and sexual habits of the couple. The doctor may recommend changes in sexual habits, and the couple will enter a period of trial and error to see if their infertility can be resolved without invasive treatments. The couple may also undergo testing to determine if there is a physical cause for the infertility.


Women who have not menstruated in six months or are older than 30 should consider scheduling an appointment to receive a diagnosis of infertility as soon as they suspect they are having trouble conceiving.
Men with a history of testicular or prostate issues or a known low sperm count, and women with a history of recurring miscarriages, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, pelvic pain or unusual menstrual cycles should consult a doctor before they begin trying to conceive.;

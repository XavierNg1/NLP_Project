 If you are using a smaller packet of instant pudding mix, about 3.4 ounces (96 grams), use 2 cups (475 milliliters) of milk. If you are using a larger packet of instant pudding mix, about 5.1 ounces (144 grams), use 3 cups (700 milliliters) of milk.;
, Most of the pudding will float on top. You may notice the milk changing color as the powder starts to dissolve.
 You can also use a handheld mixer or a food processor. There should be no lumps or clumps of pudding mix by the time you are done.
 If you are using a smaller packet, you will have enough to fill 4 bowls. If you are using a larger packet, you will have enough to fill 6 bowls.
 If you'd like, you can garnish the pudding with some whipped cream or sliced strawberries.

 You do not need to use a lot of water. If anything, a smaller amount will be easier to work with. For the baking soda method, you will only be dipping strands of hair into the solution, rather than pour it over your head, so you only need enough water to dip the dyed hair into. Allow the water to reach a rolling boil.
 The water will fizz a little violently after the addition as the baking soda dissolves, but this is normal.
 Set it down on the counter, somewhere near the sink. Do not treat your hair while the water is still above the burner.
 Leave it there for about one minute. The water will continue to fizz, and it should also change color to whatever color Kool-Aid you used to dye your hair.
 Pour the baking soda water into the sink and immediately rinse the sink out. Rinse you hair under the faucet using warm water. If it appears tangled or abnormally frizzy, you may also want to go to the shower and wash your hair properly with shampoo and water. Most of the Kool-Aid should be gone, though.

 High-waisted jeans are hugely flattering for female bodies: they accentuate your lower-body curves, conceal any bumps and lumps and help keep your lower half covered when you bend over.Look for a pair that cinches just about your hips.
Check the zipper before purchasing. An ill fitting zipper will create a bump in your front, making your stomach look larger.;
, On women, skinny jeans should hit just above the ankle bone. Jeans longer than this will make you look sloppy and jeans shorter than this will make your legs look stockier than they really are.If you find a pair of jeans that fits perfectly but are too long, take them to a seamstress to get hemmed.
Alterations will cost about $10, and depending on where you buy your jeans, can even be done in stores.
 Skinny jeans should be tight, but not skin tight. Jeans should easily slide over your calves and thighs – if they don’t, choose a larger size. Practice squatting and bending in your jeans to make sure they give you enough room to move around in.It’s better to go up a size than to buy a pair of jeans that are too uncomfortable to wear.
Jean sizes vary from store to store, so always try on a few different size options to see what works best.
 Buy a pair of skinny jeans with pockets that are high and close together. Wearing jeans with high pockets creates an optical illusion that makes your bottom look higher and fuller.If your back pockets look strained or if you can see the pocket lining, you need a bigger pair of jeans.
Avoid pockets that are wide and saggy; they won’t do your backside any favors.
If your jeans are too tight in the butt, it may cause camel toe. If you’re concerned about camel toe, opt for jeans with more room in the butt.

 Try wearing the shirt with a pair of straight-leg trousers in black, gray, pinstripe, or khaki. Tie the look together by throwing a fitted blazer over your denim shirt. Choose a blazer in a classic color, like gray, navy, or white, to create a classy business casual look. Finish the look off with closed-toe heels or flats and simple jewelry.
 You can wear the shirt on its own, or you can highlight your feminine form by wearing a sparkly metallic tank top beneath it. You could also try a lace-up boot or some funky, chunky jewelry in gunmetal gray to further glam this look up.
 For tunic style denim shirts that extend past the rear and down to the mid-thigh or longer, leggings can create a look that is both casual and edgy. Black leggings make the look relaxed, but you could also try a metallic print legging for a funkier twist. Because of how form-fitting leggings are, though, they generally do not look right with shorter shirts.

 Alternatively, you can make your own paper cover. Try to select a material that is not too slick or glossy, so your marker won’t smudge.
 Make sure to get permanent markers that will not smudge or wipe off once the ink dries. The type of marker you should get will depend on the material that your cover is made of.


If your diary or notebook has a paper cover, regular permanent writing or art markers (like Sharpies) may be your best bet.
For fabric covers, try fabric markers, which are designed to write on fabric without bleeding or washing out.
Use oil-based paint markers for surfaces that don’t take regular ink well, like leather or glossy paper.
Opaque or metallic markers are best for drawing on dark surfaces.
 Do some sketches on scratch paper before writing or drawing on your cover. Draw pictures, doodle some geometric designs, or have fun with hand-lettering words and phrases that are meaningful to you.


If you’re not comfortable drawing or writing freehand, you can also use stencils to add ready-made designs.
Try creating an airbrushed effect with a marker and an airbrush spritzer., You may wish to sketch your design in pencil before filling it in with your markers. Take care not to smudge the marker as you are drawing. Allow the ink to dry completely before using your diary or notebook.

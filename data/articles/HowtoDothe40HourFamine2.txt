 Tips on asking for donations can be found in the World Vision booklet about the Famine. Just be courteous and express gratitude to donors. Most people donate between $5 and $20.
 Go to the 40-Hour Famine Website and the "My Famine" section. You will receive a link for email recipients to use in donating by credit card.
 This is a great way to reach people. Be very courteous when contacting the public. It's safer and more fun if you go with a friend. This step is definitely optional.

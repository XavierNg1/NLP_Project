 Contact your carrier and ask them to block restricted numbers from calling you. Each phone company has different methods for blocking restricted numbers from calling your phone. For example, Verizon requires you to sign up for a program called Family Base: once you have signed up, you can use their website to block restricted numbers. At&T requires you to sign up for call screening, at which point you can specify that blocked numbers are to be screened.


If you have an iPhone, you can go into "Settings" and set your phone at "Do Not Disturb," which will prevent anyone not on your contacts list from calling you. However, this could prevent new friends or colleagues from getting in touch.

 Check with your local Ministry of Natural Resources Publications of wildlife agency to see which fish is in season and in what location. Most anywhere where the ice freezes for a while is a good place to fish.;
, Ice fishing is best during cold winters when the flesh of the fish is warm and flaky. The fish tastes the best during this time because you stay away from muddy flavored fish that you may catch from fishing during the summer.
 It is important when ice fishing that you have an ice hut. This will keep you warm when the weather is windy and the hut will allow you to stay out fishing longer. Additionally, the hut will also protect you from the sun when it becomes bright and blinding. You can purchase an ice hut at any fishing store or if you have the time and patience, you can build one on your own.
 Once you find the perfect fishing spot, drill a large hole completely through the ice until you can see open water. Then, get out the ice chisel to widen your hole. Unpack your ice hut or equipment and take out your rods to catch the fish.
 You will probably need to sit on a portable seat so that you can look directly through the hole to see what's happening. Make sure it is sturdy and comfortable.
 Once your line is set, you'll need to keep a close eye on it or watch for the flag on the tip-up to see if you've caught a fish.
 Keep a cooler to store the fish in once caught. The pleasure of ice fishing is being in the great outdoors, plus you have fresh fish to take home to eat.

 You will use the rope for both the harness and the leash, so you want it to be at least 8” long. Any material will do so long as you avoid rough, abrasive ropes that might irritate your rabbit’s skin.Fold the rope so that you have two unequal lengths, one about 6 feet and the other two feet.
Loop the center of the fold under the bunny’s neck.
Cross the two sides over the bunny’s back between his shoulders and run the shorter around his chest just behind his legs and back up to meet the other side of the rope.
Tie a slip knot where the two ropes meet. This will allow you to adjust the harness when taking it off and putting it back on.
 A slip lead is a length of rope with a handle at one end, and a ring at the other. They cost as little as $10 and can be used to make a quick figure 8 harness and leash.Pass the handle through the ring to make a loop.
Loop the handle back through the ring a second time to make another loop.
Place the looser loop around the rabbit’s chest behind his front legs and the other loop around the neck, with the ring on top between the shoulders.
Use the excess rope as a leash, or if you are using a smaller lead, attach a leash to the loose end of the lead.
 If you want to make your own leash, simply take a length of rope and tie off or clamp one end to make a handle. Tie the other end to a snap hook that you can attach to the ring on the harness.

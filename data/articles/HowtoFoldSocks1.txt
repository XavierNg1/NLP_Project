 This technique is excellent for any kind of socks, but especially any kind of casual socks. It is also an easy one for children to learn.


Start by finding a pair of clean matching socks to fold.
Lay the socks on a flat surface such as a table or an ironing board.
Line up the socks together so that if you turn them to the side, it should look like you have 1 sock. The toes, heels and cuffs should all be lined up.;
, Run your hands across the fabric to remove any lumps. This will help you create a neat fold at the end.









Take hold of one of the cuffs and fold it over the top of the other sock.
Pull the folded part down until the desired length.
 Fold a few more pairs if you would like to get faster. The more you practice, the easier this will be.









Continue practicing but with different types of socks.
This method of folding socks is especially handy if you keep your socks in deep drawers, and you have plenty of room.

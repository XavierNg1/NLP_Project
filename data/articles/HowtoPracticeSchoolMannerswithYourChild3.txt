 Ask your child’s classroom teacher if there are any areas your child needs to work on. If there’s a serious problem, get your child’s own feedback as well as feedback from other parents or teachers. If your child is having a hard time getting along with other students, ask them what’s going on and how they are struggling.For example, if you get a report about your child bullying others, ask them what’s happening at school and where problems are occurring.
 Use good manners when you speak to your child and to other adults. Show your children that you respect others through your words and actions no matter who they are. Watch your words and how you speak to your other children, your partner, teachers, and other parents. Set an example that you’d be proud to watch your child follow.Remember to say your own “please,” “thank you,” and “excuse me.”

, Children are more likely to repeat actions if they receive positive feedback or reward from them. Especially if your child is working on a skill (like picking up after playtime), catch them doing it and say something. Say, “It was really thoughtful of you to help Addie put away her toys. Thank you for helping.”Resist the urge to over-praise your child. While you want to encourage them to think of other children and do nice things, don’t treat every action as something special or remarkable.
 Teaching your child manners will take time and patience. Make sure to include lessons about manners in your child’s daily routine and look for opportunities to help your child work on their manners not just at school, but at home and during family outings as well. This will help your child to develop manners that they can use any time, and not just in one circumstance.

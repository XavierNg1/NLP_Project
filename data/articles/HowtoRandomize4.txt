 Most online random generators use a numbering system, so it will be helpful if your participants are each assigned a number. Simply write a number, starting with 1, next to each name on your list.


This tool is especially useful in classrooms, where teachers can assign their students numbers and then use this tool to call on them to answer questions or read aloud.
It is also helpful in choosing winners for giveaways, as it removes any human bias or error in choosing a winner (in the case that the winner is to be chosen randomly).
 There are a variety of websites available for this.

, Most of these websites simply ask for your first and last numbers, and it will generate a number from within that range. Others might ask for more information, like the Research Randomizer, which is helpful in research studies.
 When you click it, the program will run an algorithm, which will randomly select a number for you within the range you entered.


Document the number(s) generated as you need to. If you are using this tool to randomly assign numbers to participants, then have a document ready on which to add each number generated. Tables, spreadsheets, or lists are all good options for documentation, and you can record the numbers on your computer or by hand on printed paper.

 Select shoelaces in colors and designs that you like. If you are making a single shoelace belt, then all you need is one long shoelace. If you're twisting or braiding the shoelaces to form a belt, you'll need several shoelaces.


If you can't find suitable shoelaces, consider purchasing plain white ones and decorating them with fabric paint. Use patterns, geometric shapes, animal shapes, etc. to make the shoelace more interesting.
You'll also need hair ties or elastic bands if you are braiding the laces.
Use ribbon, lace, etc. for decorating the shoelace belt.
 Consider whether you want to keep things very simple and just use a single shoelace or you would like to use a double twist or braid the belt. The latter requires basic braiding (plaiting) skills.


The braid can be a basic one or a fishtail.

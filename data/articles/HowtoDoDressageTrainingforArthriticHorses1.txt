 Before you continue doing dressage training with an arthritic horse, you should talk to your vet. Only your vet can assess your horse’s individual needs and whether or not the horse should continue with dressage training. The vet may also suggest injections or supplements to improve joint function during dressage training., An arthritic horse’s feet should be well trimmed and balanced, especially if it is participating in dressage training. This will ensure that foot angles are as correct as is possible. Get a radiograph performed on your horse’s feet to ensure balance and proper angles., It is important that an arthritic horse that does dressage training is at an appropriate weight. This will ensure that weight is distributed evenly across joints and bones. Talk to your vet about the appropriate weight for your individual horse., Keep an eye on your horse for signs of pain and injury. Look out for heat and swelling in your horse’s joints. You should also be aware of changes in gait or increased stiffness. If you notice these symptoms, talk to your vet before continuing dressage training.

 If you say, "I thought I heard something" every time you are caught, your parents will begin to realize you are up to something. Change your tactics because obviously they aren't working.


Know what you have to work with. If you're obsessed with biology, tell your parents your teacher got you on this kick about earthworms and their nighttime habits. And if you're not obsessed with biology, put in the work (mentioning it in daily conversation) a few days beforehand to make your story believable.
 Adjust your technique based on what actions they take. What days are they the most tired? What days do they get up a bit earlier? And what arouses their suspicion the least?


If you have siblings, you may want to take into account their schedules, too. It's a lot to juggle, true, but the investment will pay off in the long-run.
 If you're out all night and you have school the next day or you simply have to act as if you weren't out all night, you'll be incredibly tired. So slam that coffee or energy drink and burn the 7 AM oil.


Caffeine should be part of your post-sneak out alibi, depending on your situation for the next day. You don't want your own tiredness leading to your exposure. All that work for nothing!
Some parents wait until morning and make you do a bunch of things when you're really tired from sneaking out. You got yours, now it's time for them to get theirs. Deal with it...it's better than being grounded!

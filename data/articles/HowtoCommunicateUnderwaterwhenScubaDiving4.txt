 Diving in low light is common. Usually the best way to communicate with other divers is by using a combination of hand signals, electronics and slates.
 Rope tugs or line tugs are often used by cave divers to communicate with their buddy.  Before the dive be sure to talk about your signals and practice them to ensure you will both understand what is being said underwater.
 A dive light is good for illumination and signaling. Hand signs may not be visible without a light. The light itself can also be used as a signal.


The first rule of using a dive light underwater is never to shine it at another diver’s face. That may attract his or her attention, but all they will see is a point of bright light coming from your direction. Point the light towards yourself, and make sure you are not blocking your hand signals.
To attract your buddy’s attention, move your light rapidly back and forth across your buddy’s light beam. Back and forth horizontal movement signals “I want your attention.” Up and down vertical movement signals danger or emergency.
Dive lights are also used for signaling from the surface at night. Here again, keep your light beam pointed at yourself unless you are trying to attract attention from a distance.
Signal “OK” using one or two arms over the head, pointing the beam of your light down toward your body.  If you are in distress, point your light toward the boat or shore and wave it back and forth over your head.
 You can bang on your tank or use a noisemaker, but it is difficult to tell where the sound is coming from when you can’t see the person making it. In addition to an audible signal, you can use your light.

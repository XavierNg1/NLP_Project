 Read any relevant chapters before class so that you can understand the lecture better. You will also be aware of any concepts that you have difficulty understanding. You can ask the teacher before class or during class to clarify these concepts., As you are reading and studying before class, you should take notes. This way, you solidify the material in your mind. You should also scan or redraw any figures or diagrams that are important (e.g. they show up multiple times in the chapter)., For every class, you should bring notes from previous classes. You should also bring your notes from independent studying, including pictures. This can give you an edge on taking notes in class, which will free up more time for you to absorb what the teacher is saying.

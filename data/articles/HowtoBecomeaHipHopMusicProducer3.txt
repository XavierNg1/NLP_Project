 If you want to become a professional, you have to start sharing your songs with friends, family, and strangers. This can be scary, but just remember that music is meant to be shared, and is more fun with other people.


Start with close friends and family members so you feel comfortable with feedback.
Never let anyone tell you that "you can't make music." If this is your dream, keep practicing and trying.
Put your music online for instant feedback and listeners. Youtube, SoundCloud, Reddit, ReverbNation--the opportunities to share your talent are endless!

, Once you've got other people nodding their heads to your music, start promoting yourself. Sites such as rocbattle.com, soundclick.com, givemebeats.net, and cdbaby.com are made to promote young producers.


Become active on social media to tap into the largest market you possibly can.
Attend hip-hop shows and network with local musicians and producers. , Part of the beauty of hip-hop is how collaborative it is. Producers and rappers mix and match regularly, finding new inspiration from other musicians and helping each other gain notoriety.


Ask rappers you know if you can produce a song for them.
Offer your beats online, hip-hop forums from Reddit to DatPiff are full of rappers looking for a beat to rap over. , Mixtapes are free albums posted online that act as resumes for the hip-hop community. Even if you cannot get a rapper to give you vocals, put together a collection of songs that people can download and share.
 Kanye West famously proclaimed that he produced "five beats a day for three summers," but that is what it took to break into the industry. Only those that practice every day, make beats for anyone who asks, and constantly learn new tricks will become successful hip-hop producers. Even if you only want to produce for fun, you'll find the only way to real become a hip-hop producer is to produce some hip-hop.

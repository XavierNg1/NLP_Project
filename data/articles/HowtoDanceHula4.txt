 Gently stretch both of your arms diagonally to the right, with your hands at waist level. Your palms should be facing the ground, and your fingertips should be elevated. As you rotate your hands so that your palms face up, bring your fingertips together to create a “blossom”. Do this for two counts, and then repeat on the left side.









This motion usually accompanies the kaholo or kao.
 Bring your right arm to the side, so that your hand is slightly above your head. Lean back to the left and look slightly upward at your hand. The left hand should be near your face, about five inches away from your right hand. Gently move your fingers as you bring your hands down to your waist. Repeat on the other side.









This motion will accompany a swaying motion, or the kaholo step.
 Move both of your hands up and down twice, in a fluid, wavelike motion. Repeat on the other side.









A similar waving motion represents the ocean. With your arms in front of you, act as though you are picking flowers out of water, alternating picking motions between right and left hands. This creates the illusion of many waves.

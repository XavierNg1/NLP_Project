 This simple approach gives plenty of room for discovery, research, creativity, analysis and conclusions.
 Make the question an exciting one that sparks the imagination and interest of the class participants. The best questions tend to be those that are large, open-ended, difficult and interesting:


Encourage class participants to consider theories rather than concrete answers. If the question seems unanswerable, children will be encouraged to posit many possibilities, pushing their thinking boundaries.






Broader, harder questions promote deeper and longer discussions.
Consider using a mix of familiar things and less well known things. For example, you might ask questions related to coursework already covered along with questions about things the class participants are yet to learn about.
For many ideas of good questions, check both How to formulate questions for SOLE activities and the SOLE guide at http://www.ted.com/pages/sole_toolkit.
 There are many possibilities here, such as reading a brief information sheet, showing a video, playing music or audio, showing images, etc., all things related to the question. Basically, look for things that spark curiosity and cause the class participants to want to dig deeper and look for the solutions.

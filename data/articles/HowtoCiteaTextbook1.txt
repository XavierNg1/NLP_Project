 Place the in-text citation in parentheses, as soon as possible after the quote or clause being referenced. Include the following information in the parenthetical citation (unless you can include any of the information in the text itself, in which case there's no need to repeat it in the citation):


The author's last name, or the authors' last names, followed by a comma. Separate multiple author names with a comma, and use "&" instead of "and" to end a list of author names.
The year of publication. If you're referencing a specific quote or passage, you must also include the page number or numbers, prefaced by "p." and separated from the year of publication by a comma. Example: (Smith, 2005, p. 42). If you're referencing a general idea from the textbook, you do not need to include the page number. Example: (Smith, 2005).
Any sentence punctuation - e.g. commas, periods - goes outside the parentheses.;
, Include all of the following, or as much as is available from the textbook in question, on your References page at the end of your work:


Author's full name, last name first, followed by a period. If there are multiple authors, place a comma between each name, including a terminal comma, and preface the last author's name with "&".
Year of publication, in parentheses, followed by a period.
The book's title, italicized. End with a period.
If the book is not a first edition, include the edition after the title, in parentheses. Place a period outside the parentheses. Do not italicize. Example: (4th ed.).
Place of publication, followed by a colon, then the name of the publishing company, ending with a final period. For example: New York, NY: Dover.

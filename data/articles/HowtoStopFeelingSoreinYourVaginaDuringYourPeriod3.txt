 This can include any number of activities, depending on your lifestyle. Sexual intercourse can be risky because it will increase the amount of friction imposed on an already sore vagina, so only have sex if you feel comfortable. Some other common irritating activities to avoid are:


Biking.
Sitting on a chair for extended periods of time (lie down instead).
Anything that causes unnecessary rubbing on your vagina, like walking in very tight jeans or driving for extended periods.
 Heating pads or hot water bottles can be purchased online or at your local store. Heating pads need to be plugged in and controlled with an attached remote, and hot water bottles can be filled up with hot or warm water from your sink. Lay the heating pad or bottle on the sorest parts of your body.


Never fall asleep with a heating pad on you.
Buy a sturdy hot water bottle so it will not leak.
Use as often as needed.
 Relax in bed whenever possible, particularly when the soreness is at its worst.If you have work or school you cannot miss, still try to avoid strenuous activities and stress.
 Eating light meals throughout the day that consist of whole grains, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates, while avoiding alcohol, salt, caffeine, and a lot of sugar will help you avoid intestinal issues during your period.As a result, your vagina will suffer from less irritation.
 Using your fingertips, press down lightly in circles around your lower belly button area. Have a friend or significant other rub your lower back if is difficult to reach, or see a professional masseuse.

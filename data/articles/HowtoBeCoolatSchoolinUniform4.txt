 Usually a school uniform has the same colors as the school athletic programs and mascot. These can be a variety of combinations of colors. Take a look at a color wheel and see what colors best complement each other. Complementary colors are any two colors which are directly opposite each other.Green is complementary to blue and yellow.
Purple is complementary to red and blue.
 No matter how dull your uniform or school colors may be, you can always brighten things up with jewelry.For girls, you can focus on earrings, bracelets and necklaces. For guys, you can stick with rings, watches and subtle chains.


Be careful not to go overboard. Even if you buy a lot of jewelry, you don't have to wear it all at once. Use different pieces and vary them throughout the week.
 Just because you're stuck wearing a uniform doesn't mean you can't add to it (sometimes). Try purchasing a new jacket or cardigan.Adding scarves or accessorizing your belts could stand out as well.
 Even if your school doesn't allow hats to be worn in the building, you can still look cool before and after school with a hat. Guys can sport a backwards baseball cap while girls flex a visor or stylish cap. The same works for sunglasses.


Just make sure you have a place to put the hat and sunglasses while class is in session so they don't get taken away. Invest in a cute bag or backpack to carry your things.

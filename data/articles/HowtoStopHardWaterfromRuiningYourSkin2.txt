 If you have hard water and wish to treat it, start with a water softening shower head before thinking about installing a larger system. These shower heads use replaceable filters to purify water and are available online or in hardware stores. Installation is as simple as replacing your old shower head, and the filtration works immediately to provide soft water in your shower., If you wish to soften the water throughout your home, buy a whole-house system. Ask neighbors or colleagues for recommendations, and read reviews of local companies providing this service. Note that professional installation of such a system is required to keep warranties, and systems cost a minimum of $1,000 before additional costs.Get quotes from different companies and compare prices before making a purchase.
Some municipalities do not allow these systems because of their use of salts and resins to remove contaminants. Call your local municipal office to find out what regulations are in effect in your area.
 Contact local companies to inquire about the possibility of renting water softening systems. This may be a more cost-effective choice for smaller homes, apartments, or vacation homes. Renting a system may also be a good way to see if buying a whole-house system is a worthwhile investment for your home.

, Hobbes was inspired by a house cat named Sprite, so he's really a tiger/cat mix. Here are few specific characteristics to imitate:
Pretend that tuna is your favorite food. Hobbes tends to prowl the house at night trying to find cans of tuna.






Lurk behind corners or doors waiting to pounce on people. Act like you are overjoyed to see them. Hobbes enjoys tackling Calvin when he gets home from school.







Nap often. Hobbes enjoys sleeping in and reading Calvin's comics while he is at school.
 Although Hobbes is an animal he has a lot of human qualities and habits as well.


Have lots of common sense. Hobbes refuses to cooperate when Calvin suggests something dangerous or daft.
Do not interfere with trouble-making beyond a few oblique warnings. After all you won't get in trouble, will you?
Insist that tigers are superior to humans. If someone asks you why humans exist, answer "tiger food" and grin evilly. Brag about tigers and your abilities constantly.
Be susceptible to girls, and mention "smoochies" often.
Be an intellectual. Be a great artist and help others with their homework. Hobbes often ends up doing Calvin's projects or reading his books.
Act kindly towards people and smile a lot. Hobbes is almost always polite.

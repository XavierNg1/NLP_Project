 You might receive a complaint that you are using an image without permission. For example, the person who submitted the photo might have stolen it from someone else. You should immediately remove the image as you investigate.You can always put the image back up if, after a thorough investigation, you believe you are using the image legally.
Courts look favorably on someone who is responsive to complaints. If you simply ignore a complaint, then you could be digging yourself a deeper hole.
 After removing the image, you should contact the person who submitted the image and tell them you received a complaint. Also tell them that you removed the photo. If you want to continue posting the image, you should ask for proof that the person who submitted the image actually owns it.


For example, you could ask for a copy of their copyright registration.
Of course, someone doesn’t have to register with the Copyright Office to have a valid copyright. However, you might not want to risk continuing to use the image if you are unsure as to who owns it.
 Some people wrongly think they can reproduce anything they want but protect themselves by claiming fair use. Instead, fair use is a vague concept that applies only in certain situations, especially when your use of the photograph is “transformative” (i.e., you don’t simply repost it).You probably shouldn’t post a picture on the grounds of “fair use” unless you have talked with an attorney. An attorney can analyze the fair use factors and decide if you have a strong case for using the image.
 Copyright infringement can carry steep penalties, and you are better off getting professional legal advice before you do something that could expose you to a lawsuit. You can get a referral to an attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.Schedule a consultation and ask how much it will cost.
At the consultation, describe your situation and explain how you want to use the image.

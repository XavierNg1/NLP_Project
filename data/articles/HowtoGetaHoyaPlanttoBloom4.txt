 Hoyas are occasionally bothered by mealybugs and scale insects.They are small, flat, oval, immobile insects and are commonly white, tan or brown.
 If they do attack, rub them off with your thumbnail or dip a cotton ball in Isopropyl rubbing alcohol and wipe them off the plant with that. Check beneath the leaves and along the stems.
 Aphids may also try to make a meal out of a Hoya. They are small, oval, soft-bodied insects that are most often green or red, although they can be nearly any color.


If they attack, set the Hoya in the sink or tub and wash the aphids off with a strong spray of water.

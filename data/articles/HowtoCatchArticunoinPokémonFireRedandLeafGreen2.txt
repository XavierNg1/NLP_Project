 Once you're situated with Pok√©mon and Ultra Balls, head down to the bottom-most end of Fuscia City and hop in the water.
 You'll be going southwest. Start by going straight down until you get stuck, then turn hard to the left to reach the Seafoam Islands, the home of Articuno. You'll see a little cave that you need to enter.


There are two entrances to this cave, but only this entrance will work to get Articuno., When you enter, there will be a small boulder next to a hole in the floor. Use Strength to push the boulder through the hole. Off to the left, on the same floor, is another boulder that needs to be pushed through as well. Without leaving that floor, push that boulder the whole near it as well. Then return to the first hole and drop through along with the boulders.


Do not use the ladder in the cave, as it will reset your boulders.
The boulders halt the current in the lower levels of the cave, allowing you to surf on the river and find Articuno.
 Keep pushing the boulders down the holes until you're at the lowest level of the cave. There will be a river with two boulders blocking it off, slowing it down enough to surf on.


If you try and surf on this water without getting the boulders placed you will be swept away and out of the cave.
 It will be sitting on a small, raised platform, and will be clearly visible from the water. You won't fight it until you talk to it.

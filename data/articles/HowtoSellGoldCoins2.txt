 Remove everything on the box that may indicate anything related to gold coins inside the box. A business name indicating gold, or anything related to bullion, is a clear indicator of the contents. Follow the steps below to ensure your package doesn't encounter any issues when sending out your gold coins:


Double box - one inside another - in case the outer box rips/breaks.
Use heavy-duty tape with nylon to cover every single edge and corner. Ensure the package is as secure as possible.
Reinforce heavier packages with strapping tape.
If the business with which you are dealing requires something extra, like a filled out form or a voided check, include it in the box where applicable., There are several options when choosing how to send your coins. In general, the most secure method, discrete method possible is preferred. You may even be able to deliver it by hand.


USPS doesn't have fuel or residential charges like UPS and FedEx, but that doesn't mean the price will be cheaper.Some sellers offer door-to-door services. An overnight shipping label will be sent to you, and pickup will be scheduled according to their schedule., Because gold is more valuable than the average shipment, and likely more prone to theft, you'll probably want to take some extra precaution when shipping your coins to ensure everything arrives to the buyer safely.


Ensure you get a confirmation number. You will want to track the package, something also called delivery confirmation.
Get insurance. Larger carriers offer loss or damage protection. Some, like UPS, offer up to $100 USD coverage for free. Based upon the declared value, you will have to make additional payment.

 Certain medications may cause drowsiness and fatigue. These include:


Antihistamines, diuretics and many blood pressure medications, amongst others.
If you think your medication may be causing fatigue, speak to your doctor. He/she they may be able to switch your medication to a non-drowsy alternative., Sometimes fatigue is related to depression - either because the fatigue is a symptom of depression or because the depressed person finds themselves unable to sleep.


If you feel depressed, speak to a doctor and know that several effective treatment options exist, such as counselling or cognitive behavior therapy., Fatigue is sometimes just a symptom of a more serious underlying issue, such as diabetes, thyroid disease, sleep apnea, arthritis and heart disease.


If you think this might be the case, or notice any other symptoms, speak to your doctor immediately.
The sooner these issues are diagnosed, the sooner they can be treated.

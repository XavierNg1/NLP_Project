Input Percentage to cell F38. Set cell G38 to .8 for now, but finally to .97 -- don't forget. The reason you want it at .8 now is that it makes it easier to find the series "sticks" that Excel mis-plots off to the right side of the chart, which you need to click on, but can otherwise be very very tiny. In the meantime, you will get some long, out of place iris fibers; do not let that deter you as you will easily fix it later by changing Percentage to .97
Enter to cell G37 the formula =VLOOKUP(RANDBETWEEN(1,10),Looker,2)*Percentage and copy it and paste it to cell range H37:IL37.
Insert Name Define Modifier2 to Row 37.
Edit Replace in cell range G23:IL23 =$ with =Modifier2*$

Be aware that this last process takes a bit of time. -- about 6-8 hours in this author's experience. Also, the line weight is a matter of personal discretion and this author chose to see some space between individual fibers and so chose a line weight of .75 or 1, but bonding of the fibers at the pupil's edge might be improved either with some constant glow or a slightly greater line weight.
 It includes the following revisions:

ShrinkExpand = 20, X_Offset = 20, Y_Offset = 20, ShrinkExpand2 = 4, X_Offset2 = 20, Y_Offset2 = 20;
The Vertical Axis Scale has a Minimum of -2 and a Maximum of 42; the Horizontal Axis Scale has a Minimum of -2 and a Maximum of 43; the Chart measures 10.0 by 10.0;
The Gradient of the Main External Circle has Darker Blue Sky at 3% and 59%, White = 63%, Very Dark Navy Blue = 68%;
The Fill for the Plot Area Gradient = Very Dark Navy Blue = 16%, White = 18%, Darker Blue Sky (a pickable color) = 25% + 36%; Medium Blue = 47%, Dark Blue = 57%, White = 64% + 83%, Dark Red Blood = 86%, Burnt Orange/Flesh = 97%;
The workbook was renamed "Model Your Own Iris In XL.3.xlsx"; Row 2 values from G2:IL2 were pasted in per a new data worksheet showing the original photo of an actual eye in large closeup on a worksheet named 'Big Baby Blue', with the following data chit using the variables Expander and XYadj to adjust the standard Cos and Sin row formulas:





;
The Cos formula in cell BB4 of that worksheet is =Expander*COS((ROW()-4)*PI()/180)+XYadj and the Sin formula in bottommost rightmost cell CG364 is =Expander*SIN((ROW()-4)*PI()/180)+XYadj;
Those columns set up a series of rings;
30ยบ lines were added via the following data chit:


 30 Degree Lines


Those applied to the original data set in columns K:AQ -- here is the image of the Expander and XYadj settings for that portion:





Together, the following image was assembled, using the actual iris photo as chart background:





Per that image and the data table, Row 2 G2:IL2 values were changed of "Model Your Own Iris In XL.3.xlsx" per pasted in values, as copied from the BB:CG cell range of Big Baby Blue;
A white triangle and white 5 pt weight line were added from Media Tools to the upper right of the Plot Area to block that portion of the "flesh" showing, and were very carefully placed.

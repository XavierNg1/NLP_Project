 Some Android devices have the Amazon App store preinstalled in it. If yours doesn’t, open your device browser and go to the official Amazon App store download page., Tap the three-bar icon at the top left to open the menu. The 3rd option down is “Apps & Games.” Tap it and the screen will reload to show a list of game apps for your Android device.
 Scroll down a bit and you’ll find three Top headings: Top Free, Top Grossing, and Top paid. The apps in these categories are highly rated by users. Tap “See all” next to the heading to view the apps in it.
 Check out the apps in the list. You can see how well they are rated by the yellow stars below the app name. Good app games should have 4 stars up.
 Tap an app from the list to view its description. Read it to learn what features the app has. If the description page has a video, watch it to see if you like it. Some videos can give you an idea of the game play.


Most importantly, scroll down the screen to view the reviews of other users. It will help you gauge if the app is really that good and worth downloading, or even paying for.
If you decide to download an app from Amazon, you must first have to log in or create an account if you don’t have one yet.

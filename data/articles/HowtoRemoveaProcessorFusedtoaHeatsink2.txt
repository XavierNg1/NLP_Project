 Heat each flat side of the CPU for 10 seconds and keep nozzle of heat gun about one inch away from the metal surface. Make sure that the heat is not hitting the CPU itself, as it may damage the transistors.



If the CPU does not turn, apply more heat to the heatsink. The warmth of the heat sink will soften the thermal paste.

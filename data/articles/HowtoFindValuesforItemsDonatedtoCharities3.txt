 When calculating the FMV of a used car, you need to determine the current value of your car. Several organizations collect this information in what is called a “blue book value.” These guides not only provide FMV estimates based on the make and model of your car but also help you make adjustments for mileage, unusual equipment or body damage.


You can locate the average sale price of a car at http://www.kbb.com and http://www.edmunds.com/tmv.html.
The FMV of your donated car may be less than the amount listed on one of the above websites if your car has engine trouble, high mileage, or body damage.
If you donate a car that is worth more than $500 to a charitable organization, you can make a deduction based on either the gross proceeds of the sale of the car by the charitable organization or the vehicle’s FMV on the date that you made the contribution., Unless you are donating a small, inexpensive boat, the IRS expects that you will consult an expert when determining the FMV of the boat. Since the condition of the boat is critically to its FMV, you need to retain an appraisal from a marine surveyor or other expert in valuing boats.


To get a general idea of what your boat’s FMV will be, you can use an online valuation website for boats. You can find this valuation website at: http://www.boats.com/nada-guides/.
You can locate an accredited marine surveyor through the Society of Accredited Marine Surveyors at: http://www.marinesurvey.org.
 You can calculate the FMV of an airplane by retaining an expert or by using an aircraft bluebook. An aviation expert would be in the best position to consider all of the factors that impact an aircraft’s FMV, including: the condition of the aircraft; damage history; depreciation; and other technical factors. However, you can attempt the valuation yourself by using an aircraft bluebook. A bluebook should help you factor in the above considerations when calculating FMV.

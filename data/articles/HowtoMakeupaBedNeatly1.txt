 A bed ruffle, also called a valance, will help to keep dust from collecting under the bed while providing a decorative accent. The bed ruffle goes on top of the box spring, covering the box spring and bed frame. It does not require washing as often as sheets, but it should be washed from time to time.


Not all beds have or need this. If yours has an external frame that serves this purpose, or if it is a captain's bed or waterbed, skip this step.;
, Your mattress pad is a protective covering that goes on top of your mattress. It also adds a slight cushion to the bed. The mattress pad should be fitted for the size of your mattress. Tuck in the top two corners of the mattress pad, and then the bottom two corners.


Smooth it out, running your hands outward from the middle, to remove any creases or wrinkles.

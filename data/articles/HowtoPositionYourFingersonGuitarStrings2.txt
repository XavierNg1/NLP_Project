 The hard little part of your fingertip, just to the sides of the nail, is a small, precise location to fret with. The fleshy part of your finger will work, but it will be harder to get a clean note and it is much easier to accidentally mute other strings. Angle your hand and fingers slightly so this hard part of your fingertips is hitting the strings.
 If you're playing a note on the 3rd fret, get your finger as close to the 3rd fret as you possibly can. This allows the cleanest, sharpest tone. You don't want to be on the actual fret, just right behind it.









Remember, if you're playing the 3rd fret you want to be between the 2nd and 3rd frets, you finger as close to the 3rd as possible.
 This is a slightly more advanced technique, but is a key way to position your fingers. You can minimize mistakes by letting unused fingers rest lightly on the strings, which prevents them from sounding out if they accidentally get picked. Frequently this involves lightly draping your index finger behind the frets you're using.
 When playing a barre chord, when one finger covers multiple strings and frets, is often the bane of new players. If some of the notes in your bar won't stay down, and always buzz when played, adjust how high you set your finger. Most people start with the tip of their finger on the top string of the barre. But this doesn't always work. Place your bar so that your finger joints don't leave any strings exposed.
 If there is a chord you struggle to fret with speed, work on shifting to it from a chord you are already comfortable with. Slowly, waiting until you can comfortably play each chord with no bum notes, strum along and switch back and forth between the two chords to build up finger strength, speed, and precision.

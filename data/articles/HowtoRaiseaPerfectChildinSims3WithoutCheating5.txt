 No more teaching, feeding or changing diapers. Those days are gone but you still need a good relationship with your child! Make sure they are now best friends. If you've taught your toddler all the necessary things they need to know, you'll be able to pick another trait for the child. If not, the game will randomly assign your child one. Give them another good trait., Also make sure your child completes his/her homework on time and goes to school in a good mood., Change their room up! They're too old for a crib now and are ready to sleep in a big kid bed., Hanging out with friends is a great thing for them to do, but make sure they complete their homework.

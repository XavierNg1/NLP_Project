 You should have 500g of lean beef, 300g of lean pork, and 200g of pork back fat. Grind the lean meat coarsely and cube the pork back fat., The first four ingredients are 1 tbsp. refined salt, 1/2 tsp. curing salt, 1 tsp. phosphate dissolved in 1/4 cup water, and 1/4 tsp. vitamin C powder. Mix the meat with these four ingredients until it is tacky.
 Now add the remaining ingredients and mix them into the meat until they've been blended evenly.
 If you put it in the refrigerator instead, then it will take 1-2 days.
 The casings should each be about 4 inches (10.2 cm) long. Link the meat clockwise and counterclockwise.
 You can dry the meat in an oven or in turbo with a temperature of 115°F (46°C) for 20 minutes. Alternatively, you can leave it under the sun for 4 hours.
 You can pack the meat into polyethylene bags or put the sausages in brown bottles and pour boiling animal fat over them.
 You can store the meat at room temperature for 4 months, or 6-9 months inside a freezer.

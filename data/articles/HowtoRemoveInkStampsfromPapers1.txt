 If the ink stamp is light enough, an eraser by itself might do the trick. This will better protect the paper. Pencil erasers are fine as long as they're still soft. If you’re not making any progress after about five minutes, switch to something more abrasive., Any type will work as long as the grit is between 150 and 400.The lower the grit, the higher the abrasiveness. If you’re using thin paper (such as notebook paper), opt for the highest grit possible., Make sure it measures about 1 by 1 inch (2.5 by 2.5 cm). This will be small enough to focus on the ink stamp without affecting the surrounding area., Place several sheets of scrap paper on your work surface. Pile them one on top of the other. This is to cushion your paper from the hard surface of the table so you may avoid tears. The number of sheets will depend on how thin your working paper is.


Make sure your work surface is solid. A table should be fine. Clear away anything you won’t need.
 Place it face-up on top of the scrap paper. Hold it down firmly with your free hand. Be sure to use all of your hand and not just your fingertips. Position this hand so that the inked area of the paper is visible between your thumb and index finger. Make sure the paper is perfectly flat.
 Work away from your body. Use slow and gentle strokes. Avoid pressing too hard. Be patient. This method can be time-consuming.


As you sand, hold the paper up to the light to make sure you're not in any danger of sanding through.
When the sandpaper feels less gritty, you can clean it by holding it up and flicking the back of it.
 Try erasing the ink as it becomes lighter. This mainly helps with any smearing effects from the sanding. Continue the process. Keep sanding the stamp. As the marks lighten, you can use the eraser to remove what remains.Keep in mind the paper is weaker where you have sanded it, so be as gentle and patient as possible.

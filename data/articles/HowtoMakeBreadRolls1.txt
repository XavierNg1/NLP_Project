Make a well in the middle of the mixture., Stir together with a large wooden spoon, to combine all ingredients and form the dough. Knead for 2 minutes to form a ball inside the bowl., Set aside in a warm place to double in size. This will take about 1 hour., You can either place parchment sheet across the sheets or grease them., Punch down the dough. Knead for another 2 minutes until the dough is smooth., Shape into balls and arrange on the baking sheet. If you want the rolls to be separate, don't touch but if you don't mind pulling them apart, they can expand into each other during baking and you can pull them apart once baked. Place another lightly oiled sheet of plastic wrap over the top of the rolls and set aside to rise until doubled in size. This will take about 15 to 20 minutes., Preheat the oven to 400ºF / 200ºC., Remove from the oven and cool on a wire cooling rack. The rolls can be served slightly warm or cooled completely.

 If you have a cool complexion, you will want a different color lens than someone who has a warm complexion. Determine your skin tone. If you have pink or blue undertones, you have a cool complexion. If you have yellow undertones, you have a warm complexion.


Cool complexions might want to choose blue, purple, rose, gray, or green tinted lenses.
Warm complexions may want to choose red, yellow, brown, amber, or orange colored lenses., If you want a vintage or classic look, you should stick to neutral tones such as brown, gray, dark gray, or green. These colors do not go out of style, and they draw the attention to the shape of your glasses instead of to the tint., A mirror-coated lens has a shiny outer layer that gives your sunglasses a polished gleam. Mirror coatings can reduce glare without distorting any color. You can choose almost any color for your mirror-coating without it affecting your vision. Some even come in multiple colors.You can buy glasses with mirror coating already applied or you can ask your optician to fit your frames with mirror-coated lenses.
 If you do not like how dark sunglasses are, pastel lenses are another option. These stylish lighter shades may not block out much light, but they will give you a cool, summery look.Lighter shades can still block out UV rays so look for a pair that is labeled as providing 100% UV protection.Some shades that you might consider are:


Light orange
Rose
Lavender
Soft blue
Light gray

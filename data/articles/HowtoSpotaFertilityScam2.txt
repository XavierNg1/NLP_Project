 One way to determine if a fertility clinic is reputable is to look into their success rates. Most legitimate fertility clinics will post their success rates on their website. The success rates should be clearly broken down by age and number of embryos transferred. If you cannot easily find the success rates, or they are not provided upon request, then you should look for another fertility clinic.The success rates themselves can, at times, be misleading. For instance, some clinics will not take on “hard” patients while others will. This means that success rates can be deceiving.
As a general rule, if the success rates are not provided the clinic should be avoided.
 If IVF is the only type of treatment offered at the clinic, this is a red flag. IVF is the most expensive form of fertility treatment and is not always necessary. For instance, some people may just need advice on properly timed intercourse. If a clinic focuses solely on IVF treatment than they are likely more interested in making money than helping couples with fertility issues., Depending on where you live there will be different requirements and certifications necessary to operate a fertility clinic. Make sure that the clinic you use is properly certified. For instance, to obtain certification in the United States a physician must complete four years of training and two years of clinical practice. Additional training is required to gain special certification in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility.

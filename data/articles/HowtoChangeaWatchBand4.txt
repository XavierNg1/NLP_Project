 Make sure the new band fits and is designed to be attached in the same way as the one you have removed. To install a new band, line it up between the lug holes and carefully thread the screw bar piece through one of the lug holes, and down through the hole in the band. Hold it in place and try to keep the bar and band aligned with the lug holes. Then take one screw and carefully position it in one of the lug holes. Turn it clockwise a couple of times.


Then place the second screw in the other lug hole.
Hold the first screw in place with another screwdriver or a screwdriver block.
Then tighten the second screw until it wonâ€™t turn any further. Once you reach this point, tighten up the first screw.
You may consider replacing the screws, which can wear out over time., If you are attaching a new band to a watch that has end caps, you will need to ensure your new straps fits the old end caps. Fix the new band to the end caps by first sliding the spring bar into the end caps. Then move it into position between the lugs, pressing the bottom of the spring bar into the lower lug. Depress the spring bar and after some manoeuvring, you should be able to click it into the hole in the top lug.This is very tricky work, and if you are struggling to get it in, pay a quick visit to the jewellers.
Bands with end caps have less regular sizing than flat-ended bands, so it is advisable to check with a watchmaker or jeweller to ensure your new band will fit.
 A new spring bar strap is reasonably straightforward to install. Ensure you have all the pieces together and the band fits the watch. Insert the spring bar into the hole at the end of the band and move it towards the watch. Depress one end of the spring bar and slide it into place between the lugs.


When one end is in the indent, press down and slide the other end into position.
Listen out for the clicks as the bar slides into the holes in the lugs.

 When she's upset and shouting at the top of her lungs, the last thing you want to say is "calm down". Although calming her down may, indeed, be your focus, those two words actually have the power to rile her up even more. In addition, saying this can make her think you are minimizing or dismissing her feelings.Instead, try something like this: "I can see you're upset/frustrated/anxious...what can I do?" or "I can't make out what you're saying. Let's take a few deep breaths and start over".
 If you see her all hung up over something that's getting her down, ask what you can do to take the burden away, even temporarily. Maybe she would like you to help her with a project at school or a chore around the house. She may even just like to go to lunch or take a walk to the park with you.
 One way to take her mind off what's stressing her is to change her perspective. Do something to make her smile. Tell her a joke or watch a funny video or movie together. Splurge and buy her that new book/pair of earrings she's been wanting. , Human touch has amazing calming properties. Since touch is one of our earliest and most basic forms of communication, mostly everyone responds to it. Physical touch in the form of hugs, a caress, a pat on the back, or hand-holding can offer comfort that perhaps words cannot. Physical touch has been shown to lower stress, improve health outcomes, and lift mood.Ask her if it's okay, then give her a hug, rub her back or shoulders, or hold her hand. This seemingly small physical connection with you might be just what she needs to calm down.

 Under certain circumstances, your doctor will prescribe blood thinning medications. These medications will prevent blood viscosity, platelet aggregation, and the formation of blood clots. Some of the most commonly prescribed medications include:


Aspirin
Hydroxyurea
Anagrelide
Interferon alfa
Busulfan
Pipobroman
Phosphorus â€“ 32

, In emergency circumstances, your doctor may advise a treatment known as plateletpheresis, which rapidly decreases the number of platelets in the blood.


During plateletpheresis, an intravenous line is inserted into one of your blood vessels to remove blood from your body. This blood is then passed through a machine that removes platelets from the blood.
The platelet-free blood is then passed back into the body through a second intravenous line.

 Power down your computer and turn off the power switch located on the back of your computer case, near the power cord socket.


Remove the case door and locate the memory slots on the motherboard. The slots, which are approximately 4.5 to 5 inches (10 to 12 cm) long, typically will be lined up in a row of 4 to 8. Depending on amount of RAM installed on your system and the number of memory slots on your motherboard, some of the slots may be empty.;
, Choose a memory stick on the outside edge of the row of slots that seems easiest to access. Notice that there are 2 plastic tabs situated on either side of each memory slot.


Place your thumbs squarely onto the tabs on either side of the memory stick you wish to remove, and press down firmly but gently. The memory stick will rise partially from the memory slot. Grasp the memory stick between your thumb and forefinger and pull it out the rest of the way.
 Document the name of the manufacturer and the memory type information.


Reinsert the memory stick by lining it up with the slot, then press down, applying equal pressure on each end with your thumbs. The tabs on either side of the slots will rise up and lock into place. Replace the case door and turn on the power switch.

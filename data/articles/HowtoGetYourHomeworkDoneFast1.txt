 Try sitting at a desk in a padded, comfortable chair. Avoid doing homework on the floor or on your bed, because these areas are more likely to make you sleepy and distracted.Also make sure that you’re working in a well-lit area so you don’t have to strain your eyes to read., Turn off your cell phone, log off of your computer (unless you will need it for your homework), turn off the television and close the door. Let your family and friends know that you do not want to be disturbed while working so they can respect your privacy.Download website-blocking apps such as Freedom or SelfControl to stay focused while using your computer for homework.
 At the start of each assignment or subject, start a timer with however many minutes you’re aiming to complete your work in. You can regularly glance at the timer to stay aware of how much time is going by and how much you have left. This will help you realize when you’re spending too much time on something, and will quickly snap you back into focus when you get distracted.If one subject or type of assignment is taking much more time than the others, you may want to ask for a little extra help in that area from your teacher or parent.

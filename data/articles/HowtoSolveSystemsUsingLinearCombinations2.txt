 When you have your equations written in standard format, lined up so the similar terms are aligned, check the coefficients. You are looking for one pair of coefficients that match.

For example, consider these two equations:


2x+y=5{\displaystyle 2x+y=5}


2x−3y=1{\displaystyle 2x-3y=1}



You should see very quickly that the term 2x{\displaystyle 2x} appears identically in each equation.

Be very careful when matching the terms. Look for the signs (plus or minus) to match as well. For this method of solving, the terms 2x{\displaystyle 2x} and −2x{\displaystyle -2x} are NOT considered to be the same.

If your system does not have a matching pair of coefficients, you cannot use this method for solving. You will need to go on to the next method.
 Working across the system from left to right, subtract each term of the second equation from the corresponding term of the first equation.

It may be helpful simply to draw a long horizontal line across the bottom of the two equations and subtract downward, as you would with any ordinary subtraction problem.


2x+y=5{\displaystyle 2x+y=5}


2x−3y=1{\displaystyle 2x-3y=1}

------------------------


0x+4y=4{\displaystyle 0x+4y=4} 




, If one of your terms matched exactly, as it should, and you subtracted correctly, then one of the variables should be eliminated from the problem. Rewrite what you have left as a single equation.

In the example above, you should be left with 4y=4{\displaystyle 4y=4}.

Because one of the variables gets eliminated in this method, some textbooks will refer to this as the “elimination” method of solving a system of equations.
 What you have left should be a fairly simple, one-variable equation. Solve it by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient.

In the example above, divide both sides of 4y=4{\displaystyle 4y=4} by 4. You will be left with the solution y=1{\displaystyle y=1}.
 Take that solution, in our example y=1, and substitute it in place of y{\displaystyle y} in either one of the original equations.

In this case, we can choose the first example, 2x+y=5{\displaystyle 2x+y=5}. When you replace the variable with its solution, you will have 2x+1=5{\displaystyle 2x+1=5}.
 Use basic algebraic steps to solve for the remaining variable. Remember that whatever action you do to one side of the equation, you must also do to the other side. For example:


2x+1=5{\displaystyle 2x+1=5}      (original equation)


2x=4{\displaystyle 2x=4}        (subtract 1 from both sides)


x=2{\displaystyle x=2}         (divide both sides by 2 to get solution)


, Verify that you have done the work correctly by checking your solutions. You should be able to place your two solutions, in this example x=2{\displaystyle x=2} and y=1{\displaystyle y=1}, into each of the original equations. When you then simplify the equations, you will get true statements.

For example, check the first equation as follows:


2x+y=5{\displaystyle 2x+y=5}       (original equation)


2∗2+1=5{\displaystyle 2*2+1=5}      (insert values for x and y)


4+1=5{\displaystyle 4+1=5}        (simplify multiplication)


5=5{\displaystyle 5=5}          (simplify addition, to get solution)

The true statement 5=5 shows the solution is correct.



Check the second equation as follows:


2x−3y=1{\displaystyle 2x-3y=1}      (original equation)


2∗2−3∗1=1{\displaystyle 2*2-3*1=1}    (insert values for x and y)


4−3=1{\displaystyle 4-3=1}        (simplify multiplication)


1=1{\displaystyle 1=1}          (simplify subtraction, to get solution)

The true statement 1=1 shows the solution is correct.
 The final solution, which you have proven to work in both equations, is x=2{\displaystyle x=2} and y=1{\displaystyle y=1}.

If you are working on graphing linear functions, you may also write your solution as an ordered pair. Thus, for this example, you would write x=2{\displaystyle x=2} and y=1{\displaystyle y=1} in the form (2,1){\displaystyle (2,1)}.

 The most common treatment for Paget’s disease of the vulva is surgery. During surgery, the doctor will perform a wide excision of the affected area. This wide area will ensure that any cells in healthy-looking skin are removed., In some instances, you may have to get a skin graft after surgical removal of the cancerous tissue. This is used when so much skin was removed that the wound cannot be closed on its own.The graft will replace the skin removed to help close the wound.
 Because of the nature of extramammary Paget’s disease, the condition may recur at any time or you may get a related Paget’s disease. You may also be at risk for additional underlying cancerous cells.Your doctor may suggest getting colonoscopies and mammograms since gut and breast tissue can be affected due to Paget’s disease.
To make sure you carefully monitor your health, work with your doctor to set up frequent appointments and follow up gynecological exams.

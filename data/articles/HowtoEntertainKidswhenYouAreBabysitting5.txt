 Kids often love to do things for themselves, especially if it means a snack. Let them pour or stir their own drinks, make their own peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, or help you make cookies. This helps pass the time while teaching them skills, and they will feel more involved and grown up instead of you taking over everything.


Many things that adults think of as drudgery is fun for young children. Find ways to let them help you and make them feel important. Thank them for helping.
 Give them options to choose from. They can help prepare too.


If you give the kids snacks, serve them a way that's a little fancier than you'd normally expect.
 Some finger painting and play dough recipes are edible. For example, vanilla yogurt with food coloring can make for interesting, edible paint. And no-bake cookies are delicious and easy!

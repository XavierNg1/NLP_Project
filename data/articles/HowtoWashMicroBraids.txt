As micro braids are quite delicate, you will need to arrange them properly to prevent possible breakage or damage while washing. Before entering the shower or bath, braid your hair into 4 to 6 larger braids. Keep the braids relatively loose to allow the water, shampoo, and conditioner to permeate all strands of hair. Secure the end of each braid with a rubber band or other type of hair tie.;

Use warm water to completely soak your hair. Dampening hair that is formed into braids can take longer than dampening hair which is free flowing, as all sections of each strand may not be completely or quickly exposed to the water.



Liberally apply shampoo to your braids. Gently rub the shampoo into your braids, as well as into your scalp. Avoid rubbing the braids excessively, as this can cause them to become frizzy. Rinse the shampoo out of the braids using warm water. Continue rinsing until all shampoo residue has been removed.



Liquid conditioner more completely hydrates micro braids than cream conditioner does, as it has an easier time penetrating the braids. For best results, liquid conditioner should be kept on your hair for at least 15 minutes. Use warm water to remove the conditioner after the appropriate amount of time have passed.



Air drying is effective when it comes to removing moisture from micro braids. After the completion of your shower or bath, use a large, clean, dry towel to gently squeeze all of the excess moisture from your hair. Remove the rubber bands which held your larger braids in place, and allow your hair to flow free. Depending on the length of your hair, total drying time can take up to several hours to complete.

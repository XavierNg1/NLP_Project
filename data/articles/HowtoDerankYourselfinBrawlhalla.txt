 De-ranking yourself is not that simple, you have to pretend like you're actually battling this Gold player on even grounds. Even a fish on land will flop around before it dies. You need to put up a fight for at least 30 seconds before you're giving this lucky guy his free elo.
 Jump off the ledge. Run off the ledge. Whatever. Just drop down and lose your stock., While your opponent stand in confusion to what just happened, as soon as you respawn and landed into the ground, jump off again into the bottomless pit., Your opponent would've caught on to your plan by now, but it's already too late., You did it, you've successfully lost your elo. But there's still one last step to do. You have to go to the character select menu as fast as you can. Don't type out "gg", don't say anything, just exit., Now that you know how to lose your elo, it's only a matter of time until you de-rank yourself by repeating this technique. You're the hero that Gold players need. A silent guardian, a watchful protector. A diamond player.

 The metric system, also called the decimal system, is designed for easy conversion. To convert from one metric unit to another, you only have to work with round numbers: 10, 100, 1000, and so on.
 Metric unit of measurements use prefixes to show how big or small the measurement is. Here's an example with units of weight, but all other metric units use the same prefixes.The prefixes below are in italics, but you can do most conversions with just the most common one, in bold.



kilogram = 1000 grams

hectogram = 100 grams

dekagram = 10 grams
gram = 1 gram

decigram = 0.1 grams (one tenth)

centigram = 0.01 grams (one hundredth)

milligram = 0.001 grams (one thousandth)

, If you know the prefixes, you don't need to look up the conversion every time you need to convert. The prefixes already tell you the conversion. Here are a couple examples:


To convert from kilometers to meters: kilo means 1000, so 1 kilometer = 1000 meters.
To convert from grams to milligrams: milli means .001, so 1 milligram = .001 gram.
 The best part about metric conversion is skipping all the calculations. Multiplying a number by 10 is the same as moving the decimal point to the right. Dividing a number by 10 is the same as moving the decimal point to the left. Here's an example of how to use this:


Problem: convert 65.24 kilograms to grams.
1 kilogram = 1000 grams. Count the number of zeroes: three. That means we multiply by 10 three times, or just move the decimal three spaces to the right.
65.24 x 10 = 652.4 (multiplied once)

652.4 x 10 = 6524 (twice)

6524 x 10 = 65240 (three times)

The answer is 65240 grams.
 It gets a little trickier when both the units you're converting between have prefixes. The easiest way to solve this is to convert to the base unit (no prefix) first, then convert to the final unit. Here's an example:


Problem: convert 793 milliliters to dekaliters.
1 milliliter = 0.001 liters. There are three zeroes, so we move the decimal point three to the left. (Remember, move left when dividing.)
793 milliliters = 0.793 liters
10 liters = 1 dekaliter, so 1 liter = 0.1 dekaliters. There is one zero, so move the decimal point one to the left.
0.793 liters = 0.0793 dekaliters.
 The mistake that's easiest to make is multiplying instead of dividing, or vice versa. When you get your final answer, check that it makes sense:


If you converted to a larger unit, your number should get smaller. (Just like 12 inches converts to 1 foot.)
If you converted to a smaller unit, your number should get larger. (Just like 1 foot converts to 12 inches.)
If your result doesn't match this, check your work.

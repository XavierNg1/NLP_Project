 The Contacts app resembles a person's silhouette on a grey background. It should be on one of your Home screens.
 It's in the top right corner of your screen.
 Here, you should see several groups of locations from which contacts are synchronizing to your iPhone.


If a location has a checkmark next to it, it's currently being synced.
 While doing so won't delete the contacts permanently, you won't see them in your Contacts app anymore.


You can undo this action at any time by re-checking the location(s) you un-checked.

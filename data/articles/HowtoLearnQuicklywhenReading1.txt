 Give yourself a minute or two to just look things over and think about what it is that you need to absorb from the text. Use the steps in the section "Familiarizing Yourself with the Text" to Identify the basics first:


Is it a list of facts? An understanding of a concept? A sequence of events?
What sort of learning will you need to do?;
, Especially if you are reading something that was assigned in a class, good questions to consider include:


Why am I being asked to read this? What is the purpose of the assignment?
How does this assignment fit in with the rest of what we have been doing? It is the main idea? Or, is it just an example or sideline to the main idea?
What am I supposed to be getting out of this? (Ideas, background information, procedures, overview?)
What level of detail am I going to need to retain? (Do I need to understand everything, or will the main ideas be sufficient?)

, The iTunes program will then begin to access the iTunes store.







An immediate click will redirect you to the "Movies" section. This will show you a strew of iTunes movies available for purchase and download or for rent.
If you click and hold on the "Movies" section, a drop down menu will appear allowing you to search the iTunes movie selections through other options including "New to Rent or Own," "99 cent Movie Rental of the Week," "Highlights by Genre," "Pre-order Movies," and by movie genre.
 This will bring you to the movie's page giving you a plot summary, the option to view a free trailer, as well as details such as run time, release date, rating, among other various specifics. This page will also show you what other viewers bought who have purchased this same iTunes movie, giving you ideas for another purchase. Directly under the movie's main picture on the left, there are 2 buttons: "Buy Movie" and "Rent Movie."






The "Buy Movie" option allows you to download the iTunes movie to your library and it is yours to own. This option is typically more expensive.
The "Rent Movie" option allows you to download the movie for a limited time only. Once you download the iTunes movie rental, you have 30 days to press the "Play" button to actually watch the video. However, once you have pressed the "Play" button for the first time, you will only have 24 hours to view that movie before your download is rendered unwatchable.
 You can also click the dropdown menu arrow on the right hand side of either button for more purchasing options.


The "Buy Movie" drop down menu options allow you to "Gift This Movie" if you want to purchase the video as a gift for someone else, "Add to Wish List" if you want someone else to buy the movie for you and a couple other options that allow you to share the movie information via the internet and social networks.
The "Rent Movie" drop down menu only allows you to share movie information via the internet or social networks.

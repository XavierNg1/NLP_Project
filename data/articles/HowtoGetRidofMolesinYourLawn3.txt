 Sometimes people will easily mistake a gopher to a mole. The biggest difference with gophers is they don't kill your grass., Keeping your grass cut will help you to easily see the signs of a mole. Also, avoid your lawn from getting too soggy. This can be challenging if your lawn is prone to this, but moles are drawn towards wet earth, so avoid over-watering your lawn.
 Put dry ice in their tunnels. The carbon dioxide it emits will suffocate the moles. Put garden wind spinners along their trails and at their entrance holes. They cause the ground to vibrate and moles won't like it, causing them to move on to a more "peaceful" location.
 Moles dislike digging through rocks, so it could be a good preventative measure to fill their tunnels. Other moles could occupy the abandoned tunnels, but they'll be less inclined if you use rocks.

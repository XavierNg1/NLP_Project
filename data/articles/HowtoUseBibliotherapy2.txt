 Clinical bibliotherapy is implemented by a trained mental health professional. This type of intervention aims to work with significant emotional or behavioral issues as guided by a psychologist, therapist, or mental health professional.The goal of clinical bibliotherapy is to aid in your recovery inside and outside the therapy room.


Your therapist may recommend using a workbook each week and discussing your progress.
Clinical bibliotherapy often involves discussion with a therapist during and/or after reading. It can include fiction, nonfiction, and self-help books.
 While some therapists may actively use a book in session to discuss and reflect upon, others may ask you to supplement therapy by using a book during the week between sessions.Sometimes, therapists assign ‘homework’ for you to work on and bring back for subsequent sessions. This can include reading a book and engaging in exercises outside of therapy.


For example, a therapist may suggest a book on deep breathing and relaxation if you suffer from anxiety, or suggest a workbook to cope with your depression.
If this is not part of your therapist's treatment plan, don't hesitate to ask if they have any reading recommendations.
 Developmental bibliotherapy is used by teachers, librarians, parents, and other adults who are interested in children’s growth and development.While not implemented by a therapist, it can help children gain skills and perspectives. Some teachers may use bibliotherapy to address issues in the classroom, and parents may use bibliotherapy to help aid a child’s understanding of things like cancer or chronic illness.


Developmental bibliotherapy can be useful in learning values, social skills, and for self-discovery. It can aid in understanding puberty, bodily functions, and developmental milestones.

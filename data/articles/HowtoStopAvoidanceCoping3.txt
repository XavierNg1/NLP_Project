 To stop avoidance coping, you need to know that you’re doing it. Spend some time acting as an observer to your own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.Ask people who ae close to you to let you know when you appear to be avoiding the things that cause you anxiety.
 Keep a notebook with you so you can jot down any interesting information you learn through your observations. Notice which situations prompt you to avoid and what you do to avoid them.For example, you might avoid going into a certain building at your school because it reminds you of an embarrassing incident that happened there.
You may be surprised by the lengths you will go to avoid things that make you feel anxious. For example, you might pretend to be ill or lie about having a previous engagement.
 While you may engage in avoidance coping to prevent anxiety, you may find that it has the opposite effect. Avoiding limits you from being able to grow and learn from what you fear. And, it ends up adding to your stress and anxiety.Write down your thoughts and feelings when you avoid. For example, you might avoid the building, but still feel anxious. Or, you find yourself thinking, "I'm such a freak."

, In order to fully take action against your avoidance coping, you need to recognize that avoidance doesn’t help. Think back on some situations or events you have avoided and the outcomes.Have there been negative consequences associated with avoidance coping? Maybe you lost a friend, missed out on a big job opportunity, or see yourself as weak because of it.
Also, be sure to ask your spouse, family, and close friends, “Does my anxiety affect your life in any way?”

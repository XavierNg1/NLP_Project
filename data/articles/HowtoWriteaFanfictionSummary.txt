 Once your story is complete, read it again and try to determine your main theme. Any major pairings, battles or dilemmas should be included in the summary if possible.;
, If someone reads a summary with several misspellings or incorrect grammar, they will assume that the fan fiction is also typed in a similar way and not even bother to check out the story. Therefore you should keep it to proper English. Make sure you do not type in all caps.
 That way your readers won't get any nasty surprises. It is much better to use ten characters in a brief warning than to get a flame the next day. If you cannot list a warning in the summary, you should list it in the first chapter. There is no excuse for posting triggering material without warning. Warnings include "AU" (meaning "alternate universe"), "Abuse", and things of that nature.
 If you've ever turned a book over, it only has about half a page of a summary. Remember that the average book is usually much longer and deeper than the average fan fiction. Therefore, the summary for a fanfiction should be shorter than that of a book. An average is about 150 to 277 characters. Some websites, such as Fanfiction.net, will not let you go over that amount of characters.
 Often people will want to read it more if they actually see a bit of your writing! You may also have a quote that sums up the whole story well. If you do, use it, as such quotes can make great summaries.

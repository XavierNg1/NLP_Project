 There are a few places on the board that allow you to score double word score, twice in the same word. They give you even more points that the shiny triple word scores, so try to use them!

, Some experts try very hard to close off every possible move for the opponent. It works for some. Try it if you haven't done so; it may work for you.
 That way s/he will be tempted to make a quick move that is low points.

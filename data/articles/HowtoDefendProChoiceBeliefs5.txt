 Never interrupt, shout over, or insult another person (even if you feel that they really, really deserve it).
 Religion and government are separate, and religion and abortion rights are separate. Condemning someone's entire religion is cruel and divisive.


Not all religious people are anti-choice; for example, it is possible for some self identified Christians to be pro-choice. Even if the person in front of you is a flaming bigot, think of the nice religious people, and don't insult their religion.
 Pro-choice people have long pointed out how "baby" and "unborn child" are manipulative ways to refer to an unwanted fetus. But calling all fetuses "clumps of cells" is also an insensitive use of rhetoric, because there are some fetuses that are truly loved and wanted, and to those parents the fetus is far more special. Stick with the factual term fetus.


Dismissing fetuses as mere "clumps of cells" can be deeply upsetting to people who miscarried a loved, wanted fetus.Don't accidentally minimize the hardship of losing a beloved fetus.
 Transgender men, nonbinary people, and some intersex people of any gender can also get pregnant. Be sure not to step on the toes of transgender people as you fight for the rights of everyone with a uterus.
 You are not obligated to change anyone's mind, nor do you have to keep talking to someone who says very rude or upsetting things. This may be personally upsetting to you. Say "I don't want to talk about this anymore," "I need a break," or "I need to get some air" if you can't keep calm. Any decent person will respect your wishes.


If the person makes you feel unsafe, leave right away. Call police if you are being threatened or stalked.

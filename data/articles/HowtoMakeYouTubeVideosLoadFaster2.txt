 Sometimes all it takes to speed up YouTube videos is a simple browser update. Take steps to update Google Chrome, Firefox, or Internet Explorer and see if that improves things.
 This can greatly affect the quality of videos. You'll need to find the driver on your computer, install any updates you find, and restart your computer.



Google Chrome, Firefox and Opera are all modern browsers that work well with YouTube.
 If it's not so important to see the videos clearly, you can try loading them at a lower quality, like 360p instead of 720p. The higher the video quality, the longer it takes to load on many browsers.


You might also try using a smaller image size when you're watching videos. Things might speed up if you don't use fullscreen mode.

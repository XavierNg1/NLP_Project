 Pinch the sides of crust to the pan and push the center down firmly to the pan. Using a fork or toothpick, poke holes at the bottom and sides of the crust at 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) intervals to prevent puffing up. Bake at 400 °F (204 °C) , 10 minutes or until crust starts to brown.;
, After you have prepared your pie crust, preheat your oven to 350 °F (177 °C).
 In a large bowl, mix pumpkin and cream cheese with an electric mixer. Blend until creamy and bright orange on high speed. Add melted butter and the eggs. Blend well until well-combined and there are no egg streaks.
 Add the sugar and salt and blend again on medium. Mix until the dry ingredients have combined in with the pumpkin batter.
 Add vanilla, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice or ginger. Add each one at a time to avoid having your blender get stuck. Use medium speed for better results. When mixed well the mixture should be orange and creamy.
 Pour filling into the pie crust and bake 50-60 minutes or until the center is set.

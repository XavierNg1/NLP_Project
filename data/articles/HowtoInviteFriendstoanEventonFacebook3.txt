 The quickest and easiest way to invite all of your Facebook friends using Google's Chrome browser is to download a free browser extension that will do the work for you. On the home page of the Chrome Web Store,type "Invite all friends." On the search results page, scroll down to the "Extensions" section. You should see several free extension designed to help you invite all your friends to Facebook events.
 These extensions are usually easy to use and come with their own instructions. The precise steps involved when using each extension may vary slightly. The rest of the steps in this section will assume you chose the extension "Facebook Friend Inviter," a popular choice which should be near the top of your search results.


Click "+ Free," then "Add" in the box that pops up to add the extension to Chrome.
 To do this, log into your Facebook account, select "Events" from the Favorites menu on the left of your home page, then either create a new event or select an event that you've already created.
 A popup window displaying a checklist of your friends should appear. To invite every friend, you need to scroll to the bottom of this window. Facebook doesn't automatically populate the list with all of your friends - it adds them as you scroll down. Because the extension automatically checks only the friends that are displayed in the list, scroll to the bottom of the window to ensure every friend is displayed.
 The icon is located in the extensions area of your Chrome window - usually in the top right. The icon is a blue lowercase "f" next to a box with a check mark in it. Within a moment or two, a popup window that says, "Done, all your friends have been selected" should appear. If done correctly, every entry in your "Invite Friends" window should be selected.
 This invites every selected friend, completing the process! Enjoy your party or event.

 If you are actually innocent of the crime you’re being accused of, the best way to prove your innocence is to establish an alibi. If you were with someone else at the time the crime was being committed, they can vouch for your innocence.If you stand accused of cheating on a test and you know you were actually at the nurse when the test was occurring, have the nurse call your parents and explain.
If someone else knows who committed the crime, convince that person to come forward and exonerate you.
 When most people commit crimes, they have a motive or reason for doing so. Proving that you had no reason to want to commit this offense is a useful way to prove your innocence.If you’re accused of stealing money from your parent’s wallet, point to all the money you just made baby-sitting as a reason why you wouldn’t need to steal.
If you know that your brother really wants a new video game, but he doesn’t have the money, point to that as a possible motivation for committing the crime.
If you know someone else has a clearer motivation for committing the crime, suggest them as a possible suspect.
 The only real way to exonerate yourself fully is to catch the person who actually committed the crime. Depending on the crime and person who committed it, this may be impossible to do, but you owe it to yourself to try.


Set up a trap to catch the criminal. If you’re accused of stealing food from the pantry, set up a hidden video camera above the pantry to see if you can catch the person in the act.
If you think you know who did it, stage a conversation with that person and try to trick them into confessing. Record them on your smart phone and use the recording to prove your innocence.
Remind your parents that under American law, you are innocent until proven guilty.

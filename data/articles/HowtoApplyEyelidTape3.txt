 Eyelid tape comes in a few different colors. You can get eyelid tape that is clear, skin toned, or even black to make it look like eyeshadow or eyeliner. Choose an eyelid tape that you think will work with your skin and makeup.Clear eyelid tape may be your best choice if you don’t plan to wear much (if any) makeup while you are wearing the strips. Just keep in mind that any part of the strip that peaks out will be shiny under the light.
 Emphasizing your eyes can also help to hide the tape while you are wearing it. Try going all out with some black liquid liner and false eyelashes to take the attention away from the eyelid tape.Avoid wearing too much eyeshadow while you are wearing the eyelid tape. It can weaken the adhesive.
 You can also draw attention to another part of your face while you are wearing eyelid tape. Try going with a bold lip look while you are wearing eyelid tape to help distract from your eyes.

For example, you could wear a bright red or pink lipstick to emphasize your mouth rather than your eyes.
 If someone notices that you are wearing eyelid tape, then it’s best to just be honest about why you are wearing it. Don’t be ashamed to tell them that you are wearing eyelid tape to make your eyes appear rounder or to create a new crease in your eyelid. People do all sorts of things for beauty and wearing eyelid tape is not a very drastic measure in comparison.For example, wearing a small piece of tape on your eyelids is nothing compared to going from brown hair to blonde hair. Wearing eyelid tape is just another way to accentuate your eyes, like wearing eyeliner or mascara.

 If you know the writer personally, consider the writer's personality and point of view. This may offer insight as to whether or not this person is being sarcastic or not.


Sarcasm is frequently used as a form of humor. If the writer is known to make jokes, he or she may be using sarcasm in text. Sarcasm is also used when someone is frustrated. Is this person one to get annoyed easily?
Also, consider the writer's opinions. If this is a writer is, politically, pretty far to the right, he or she saying Obama's new healthcare policy is "just wonderful" is probably sarcasm.
 Just as you can figure out the meaning of the word by examining the words around it, you can detect sarcasm by examining context. Where did you encounter this piece of writing you believe is sarcastic? Given the context, is there any evidence that would indicate sarcasm?


What was happening leading up to the sarcastic sentence? Was the writer expressing an opinion, joking around with another person, or engaging in an argument? All three of these situations are ones where sarcasm is a likely response.
You should also look at the text proceeding the potentially sarcastic portion. It may be leading in to sarcasm. For example, let's return to an above example. If the writer spent a paragraph criticizing Obama's healthcare plan, and then said the plan was "just wonderful," you can reasonably assume the "just wonderful" sentiment was meant to be sarcastic.
 Where are you reading the text? Are you on an online forum or are you reading an e-mail for work? Certain mediums are more prone to sarcasm than others. You could get in trouble for sending a sarcastic e-mail in a professional setting. However, people use sarcasm all the time when casually commenting on articles online.

 How many times have you seen a really popular, admired person stink badly of sulfur? Shower daily, wash your hair every other day and apply deodorant. Aftershave/Perfumes and Colognes are also a good way to smell your best!;
, Nobody likes someone who tries too hard so wear something that makes you feel comfortable and people will feel relaxed around you. If you're a girl who likes to accessorize, use very subtle ways to upgrade your look.
 A little dusting of powder and some mascara and lip balm will do the job, and if you feel you need any more, try to keep it to a minimum. Nobody will respect someone who has orange foundation lines and clumpy mascara.
 People feel most comfortable around someone with a smile rather than someone who gives them looks that makes them feel insecure. Compliment your friends and others, even people you don't know. A simple 'I like your shirt', or whatever, will do the trick. If you like, you can make your compliments more unique. People will feel cared about and better about themselves if you let them know they're important to you. Real smiles start with the eyes.
 You don't have to be a straight A student to try your best. Focus on your studies and don't get involved with the wrong things, such as heavy drinking, smoking and taking drugs. Teachers will praise you more and people will follow your example.
 Whether it's helping out at Youth Hostels or feeding the hungry children of third world countries, it all makes a difference and people will notice your good nature.
 For example, if someone looks alone, invite them to sit with your group at lunch. If a new person starts, show them around.

 To overhand serve, it is an easy, four step piece. You'll first need to have your left foot slightly in front of right foot. The rest is in the next section.
 Do this move. (2 part) Step 1, your position; have your left foot forward. Hold the ball directly in front of you at chest height, arm length away. Step 2, bring back your right arm like your hand is going to touch your ear. Step 3, keeping left arm straight, toss the ball up about a foot above your head. Toss it a little bit forward, but not so much you can't reach it. Step 4, step forward with right leg, and hit the ball as you step. If you aren't strong, do it with your fist instead of flat handed; some coaches don't allow their team to do it with their fist, though.

 Pull the skin below your eye down with one finger, and use your other hand to squirt some drops into your bottom lid. This method produces tears that look quite real, but getting the timing right is tricky, since you have to bring the bottle to your eye right before you want the tears to flow. It's a great method to use if you're fake crying for a photo shoot, but it's not very effective if you're trying to fool someone in person.
 Since you don't have to work hard for the tears using this method, you'll need to make an extra effort to look like you're crying. Be sure that your eyes, forehead, and mouth look like they do when you cry.


If appropriate, try "crying" tears of joy instead of tears of sadness when you use the eye drops method. This way you won't have to work as hard to look sad; you may find it easier to look ecstatically happy.
If you can find an excuse to turn away for a minute, put the drops in your eyes when the person for whom you're performing can't see your face. You'll have to be quite sly to pull this off.

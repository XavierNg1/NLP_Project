 It’s their apology, so let them take the lead. When your coworker pulls you aside to talk, hear them out completely. Resist the urge to interrupt what they’re saying.


Let them get their entire message across before giving your response.;
, There’s a tendency among victims to minimize the wrongdoing of the offender. This doesn’t help anyone, however. It lets the person off the “guilt” hook, and protects you from dealing with conflict. Conflict is a healthy way to deal with disagreement and grow from an experience, so don’t act like you aren’t bothered just to keep the peace.Avoid comments like “It’s no big deal” or “Don’t worry about it.” Saying something like this is dismissive of your feelings, and the other person’s.
 Before you formulate a response to the person’s apology, evaluate the message. Was it heartfelt? Or, did it seem like the person was indifferent to what they’d done to you? Look into their eyes and question whether they truly feel sorry about their behavior.


You can spot sincere apologies by looking for two key elements: the person seems to understand how it feels to be standing in your shoes and the person offers a solution to make amends.

 Lie down on one side and prop your head and neck up with your elbow. Look straight ahead of you. Using your elbow to prop up your head will keep you from straining your neck.


Keep your other arm in front of you with your palm facing down., The leg should go up at least one or two feet. You can keep your free hand either on your hip or on the floor in front of you for some additional support. Keep looking straight in front of you instead of looking up at the leg.









Make sure you keep your hips stacked and your torso still., Keep your body in the same position except for the leg, and slowly lower it until it meets the other leg. Remember to keep your spine straight and to avoid caving forward as you lift your leg.









For more of a challenge, lower it, but keep it about an inch away from the bottom leg to feel an extra burn in your side.
 Once you've finished with one leg, just move over onto your other side and elbow and repeat what you did with the other side.









This is a great leg exercise for your side body. It is also a great workout for improving the appearance of your butt!Most leg lifts are focused on working out your front body, so this is a great way to get that full-body workout!

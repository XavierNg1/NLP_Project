 Metal cases are hardier than plastic and fabrics, so you are free to use hot water on them and any dish soap or detergent. Collect the water then add a small amount of the cleaner to make it soapy.


Many companies offer metal cleaners, too. You may wish to check a local shop for one of them.
 Because metal cases are stronger, you can use most kitchen brushes or sponges. Using the brush or sponge, push the soap and water up into the corners and scrub any marks.


Avoid harsh cleaners such as steel wool, Brillo pads, and abrasive substances. These leave scratches that make future cleaning more difficult.
You may still wish to use a gentler cleaning material such as a soft cloth for the sake of reducing wear and being better able to get into the corners.
 Metal exposed to air oxidizes, which causes the unpleasant colors at the bottom of your pencil case. Add two tablespoons of vinegar to a quart of water in a pot on the stove. Boil this mixture, then soak the pencil case in for 15 minutes. Repeat as needed., Put it back under warm or hot water in order to remove all the soap or vinegar. This removes any possible erosion from those chemicals and prepares the case for drying.
 Grab a cloth or a paper towel. Wipe away all the water. At this point, the pencil case should look ready for use again. If stains persist, you may wish to clean with vinegar if you havenâ€™t tried or only did it once.

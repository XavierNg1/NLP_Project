 The sod you use for planting rye grass should be cut no more than 24 hours before you plan to plant it. If you can’t plant the sod right away, store in a cool, dark place so that it doesn’t dry out., The soil you lay the rye grass sod on top of should be slightly moist. This will help the sod begin to take root. It also ensures that your rye grass sod doesn’t dry out., The sod will root best if it’s laid in a staggered placement. This means that the seams of the sod pieces should not line up exactly. Lay one row, then stagger the second row so that the seams from the first row touch the middle of each piece in the second row.You may have to cut down the sod to ensure it fits into smaller spaces or staggers properly. Use garden shears to gently cut the sod pieces down to size. The sizing doesn't need to be exact since you can fill the spaces in with soil, but it should be pretty close.
 If you’re sodding a new rye grass lawn on a slope, lay the soil out as you would on a flat surface. Then stake it with garden stakes so that the sod stays in place until it takes root., This prevents the edges of the sod from drying out. It also helps the sod take root in a uniform manner, without space in between, giving your lawn a smooth look., Once you’ve laid the sod and filled in any cracks, water it with a garden roller that is about one third full. This also helps smooth out the sod and soil and will contribute to a smooth lawn.

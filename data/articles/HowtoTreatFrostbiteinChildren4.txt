 While continuous exposure to very cold weather; the first action of the body is to order the peripheral blood vessels located at the body’s extremities to undergo vasoconstriction, this narrowing in their lumen decreases the blood flow to the skin layers, while keeping it to nourish and ensure that vital organs (Brain, Heart, Lungs and Kidneys) are still functioning.


This would make your child to feel cold and to have a cold skin if was touched, that’s why frostbite mainly attacks extremities like hand fingers, leg toes, nose, ears, cheeks, and chin, the decrease in the peripheral temperature would allow the body to keep his internal temperature to keep the vital organs.
Till this stage it can be called a “Frostnip” and can be still treated at home, symptoms would appear like having a degree of white skin, tingling sensation, then numbness.
 While exposing to freezing climate is still running; the body takes another step aiming to minimize the damage happening at the affected extremities by making vasodilatation to the peripheral blood vessels for a while then returning back to constriction, blood going to the extremities supplies them with oxygen and other nourishment to keep them functioning as much as possible.


However; the return back is clearly with a fall in its temperature as a result of being exposed to the outer cold climate; this leads to its returning to the internal vital organs causing an additional decrease in the internal body temperature causing another situation called Hypothermia which is the decrease in the internal body temperature less than 98.6 F or 37 C.
This is the point when the brain detects the initiation of hypothermia and decides no more peripheral dilatation, ordering a permanent vasoconstriction at the extremities and announcing the starting of frostbite.
 This stage concludes the starting of the cellular damage resulted by the sharp shortage in heat, nourishment, and oxygen at the extremities, while skin cells and tissues scream for the three mentioned above; dehydration become to form another problem and directly cause capillaries membrane lining damage that causes fluids leakage outside of cells.


This can cause swelling of the affected tissues, redness and numbing, the skin also would be dry and hard, in a re warming trial; the blood flow would gradually return back to injured extremities through the damaged blood vessels that would allow some of the circulated blood to escape to the near soft tissues, this would affect the velocity of the running blood especially in the small tiny vessels, that may lead to the formation of blood clots, this complication can easily cause further irritation to the already damaged tissues that can increase the inflammation and swelling there.
The symptoms at this point (re warming stage) are said to be very painful as blood is trying to circulate back through the injured vessels, pain, aching, tingling and swelling are all can be seen here, throbbing sensation can persist for few days or weeks depending on the damage degree, in addition to the discoloration of the skin into a black bluish color due to the trapped leaked blood, the degree of damage can be determined here by doctors when parents follow the first aid steps for frostbite to their children to allow re warming before heading to the hospital to seek medical help by their doctor.
 Light frostbite would show signs like feeling cold, having tingling or itching sensation then numbness, skin appearance would tend to have a white color but frostbite degree or damage is still said to be superficial, this can be proven by parents or doctor’s pressing with their finger on the affected skin finding it giving some resistance indicating that deep layers are not damaged yet.


On the other hand; deep frostbite with continuous cellular damage is manifested by numbness ended by a complete sensation loss, with noticeable skin swelling and black bluish skin discoloration, finger pressing would show hardness of the skin with no resistance indicating great chances that deep layers have already undergo a degree of damage, skin blisters can be seen after the first 24 hours of cold exposure.
Note for other similar conditions with frostbite that are known to have milder damaging effect to the affected skin, examples are like Frostnip as we mentioned before, with another difference of being lighter in making damages; that its signs resolve once applying first aid procedure and re warming, with no skin damage in the future.
Another condition is called Trench foot that mainly affects the feet and toes, causing their redness, swelling, associated with pain or numbness sensation, this condition is widely seen within adults and children at home in winter, especially people with weak peripheral circulation.

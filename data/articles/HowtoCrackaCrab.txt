 Do this by holding the body in one hand and twist the class of the off with your other hand. Sometimes crab meat comes out of the legs and swimmer fin; you can eat that right up.;
, An explanation of how to eat the claws comes later.
 Flip the crab’s body on its back to open the apron. The apron looks like a tab or a flap. Discard the apron; we are not going to eat that.

 You can do this using your hands or knife.
Press your palm down to break the chambers and pull apart if you decide to use your hands.
Eat! Any meat that is firm and white is edible. You can use your fingers or thing metal seafood picks to pull the meat out.
, Sometimes people tend to forget about the claws because they think there is not anything in them. However, there is very juicy and sweet meat in these legs that you can use for soups or crab cakes. To begin, take the hinged seafood cracker and hit the claws with a crab mallet, or use your knife. The easiest way to open a claw:


Take your knife and lay it with the sharp side down on the middle of the red side of the claw.
Use the crab mallet to gently hit the knife until it is halfway through the claw.
Lastly, swivel the knife to the side. The claw will open and make it much easier to grab the crabmeat.
Once you have snapped the shell open, eat the meat. Make sure you avoid the cartilage.
 So now you can tackle that uncracked crab with confidence!

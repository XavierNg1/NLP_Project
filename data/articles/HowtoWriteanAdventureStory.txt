 This is very important if you are to create an adventure story, your artifact could either be based from true objects (the Excalibur, apple of discord, etc.) or you could make one up! Does your artifact possess supernatural powers? Be free and creative! Have fun.;
, Every adventure story must have a hero or else the events will not untangle! You could choose what your protagonist could be, is he/she male or female? What's his/her educational degree? Why is he/she interested in the artifact? It's your call!

, Adventure stories are no fun if the hero goes solo, that's why you must create a sidekick (usually a leading lady, a child, etc.) Is your sidekick loyal or is he a traitor? Is he/she male or female? It's also your decision.
 Now if there's good, there is always bad, that's why you must make a villain. Is your villain alone or with some companions? Does he repent or not?

, Now this is the most fun part in making an adventure story. You get to choose, arrange and decide the fateful events in your story. Make a draft and put it aside so that when you're done making the story, you can polish your story's details. Does the villain die? Is the artifact retrieved?

, When you're done with the drafts, you must arrange your events and start to polish your adventure story's details. Here you can see the plot spaces and could change a certain event in the story.
 Since your adventure story is already done, write its title! It must be connected to your story and it must be inviting to your listeners. After making your adventure story, go share it with your friends!

 Most padlocks will have the combination listed either on the back of the lock or somewhere within the packaging. Look for a three digit code when you buy your lock., Turning the dial three full rotations clockwise will reset the numbers and allow you to input the first number in your combination. In most padlocks, if you don't reset it, your code won't work.
 On your third rotation, line up the indicator on the top of the lock with the first digit in your combination. The indicator will usually look like an arrow or upside down triangle., Turn the dial to the left, passing the first number in the combination. Line the indicator with the second digit in your combination after you pass the first number. Stop rotating the dial once you land on the second digit.Remember to pass the first number in the combination when turning the dial or your lock will not open.
 Complete the opening of your lock by rotating the dial clockwise until the indicator matches up with the last digit in your combination. Do not pass the third digit in your combination this time.


When you last on the last digit in the combination you should hear the click the shackle disengaging with the body of your lock.
 Gently pull down on the body of your lock to disengage it. You can then rotate the lock and remove it to open your storage.

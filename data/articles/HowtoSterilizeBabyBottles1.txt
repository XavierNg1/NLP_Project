 Although it never hurts to be extra clean, sometimes going through the work of sterilization is unnecessary.

Historically, water has never been filtered as much as it is today. That means mothers of the past had to deal with bacteria in the water contaminating their baby bottles. Today, unless you know your water has bacteria in it, you may not need to sterilize it for this reason.
No environment is completely sterile. Therefore, although you may sterilize a bottle, it will likely come in contact with bacteria from your hands, air, counters, etc. Soap and water is often all that is necessary to thoroughly clean a bottle, making further sterilization superfluous.
It is safe to sterilize baby bottles before the first use after purchase from a store, as well as after extended periods of disuse or if your baby was recently ill.;
, You will need to pour enough so that the bottle(s) as well as the nipple(s) are completely submerged., Remove the nipples or tops from their bottles.
 This is to clean any preliminary grime or bacteria that may have found its way onto the bottles. Do this while bringing the pot of water to a boil., The bottles should be completely submerged, and left to soak for at least ten minutes. This allows time for the bottles to be completely cleaned of any remaining bacteria.
 Use metal tongs to grab them and place them to dry upside-down on a drying rack.
 The process of washing and boiling removed any harmful bacteria from the bottles, but being placed back into a natural environment removes any sterility they had. This is fine though, as all homes house bacteria which is important for helping a babyâ€™s immune system to develop. If a bottle is not used immediately, put all the parts back together and store in a covered area to keep from the insides being contaminated.

 For lasting texture and beachy waves, set one to three braided sections with your flat iron. Clamp and iron braids down while working through sections the same width as your iron. Loosen the braids, then toss and lift your roots to work hairspray underneath.

Braid hair into three sections for thick hair. Place one on each side starting above your ears and one in the back starting at your nape.
Braid hair into two sections for medium to thick hair. Place one on each side starting above your ears.
Braid hair into one section for fine hair. Place one in the back starting at the nape.;
, Velcro rollers work by giving you soft lift off your scalp. Start with a section the same width as your roller in your crown area. Use three rollers back to back and roll one to two more perpendicularly on each side. Continue this pattern all the way to your front hairline if you want maximum volume.

Make sure you roll each section directly off and perpendicular to your scalp.
Add extra volume by pulling each section towards your face at a 45 degree angle and rolling back.
 Your natural oils will give you the grip and texture you need for a tousled look using a curl wand. Hold the wand with the small end pointing down and wrap 1 inch (2.5 cm) sections away from your face.

Swap your wand for a regular 1 inch (2.5 cm) curling iron and make sure you point the top down., Make your curls look effortless and lived-in instead of perfectly placed by spraying dry shampoo and piecing them out with pomade. Curl your hair with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) curling iron, spray and scrunch dry shampoo through the mid-lengths, ends and roots of your hair. Rub a fingernail sized amount of pomade through your palms. Then, twist 1 inch (2.5 cm) sections of your curls while you run the pomade through 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) of your ends.

 Wash the strawberries, and slice off the stems. Cut the strawberries into smaller pieces; this will ensure that they blend more smoothly.
 Zest the lemons first; it will be a lot easier this way.
 If you don't have a blender, you can use a food processor fitted with metal blades instead.
 From time to time, you may have to open up the blender, and push the syrup down the sides with a spatula. This will help everything blend more smoothly.
 If you'd like the syrup to be more sweet, add more sugar or honey. If you'd like the syrup to be more tart, add more lemon juice. Make sure to blend the syrup again to mix in your adjustments.
 If you are using a bottle, pour the syrup through a funnel. Close the lid tightly once you fill the jar or bottle.
 Don't put the hot syrup straight into the fridge. You will risk raising the temperature and spoiling the surrounding food.

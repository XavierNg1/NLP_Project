 It is common for drivers to panic or even freeze up when their vehicle fails to behave as anticipated. While this is natural, it is also extremely dangerous. Combat this by preparing yourself to identify understeer situations by looking for signs of it.The best way to avoid panic is to develop an understanding of what causes dangerous situations.
You cannot correct understeer without identifying it.
 As you drive, pay attention to the way the car reacts to your steering input. If you turn the wheel to the left or right, but feel the momentum of the car carrying it forward rather than in the direction you’re trying to turn, you are in an understeer situation.In extreme understeer situations, the vehicle will not turn but will continue to go straight regardless of steering input.
In less extreme situations, your ability to turn may just be limited.
 When understeer occurs, the vehicle is pushing forward despite your steering input. This means the front tires are sliding and don’t have the grip to change the car’s direction as you turn the wheel. That loss of grip will make the steering wheel feel suddenly lighter and easier to turn.When the steering wheel suddenly gets much easier to turn, be careful not to turn the wheel even further due to the loss of resistance.
Some luxury cars may be more difficult to read steering resistance in due to their light wheel resistance to begin with.
 Understeer commonly occurs due to a loss of traction in the front wheels, and because most vehicles do the majority of their braking with their front wheels, heavy braking can cause understeer. If you lock the tires up by slamming on the brakes, the front tires will not have the traction to affect change in the direction the vehicle travels.If you slam on your brakes and they lock up, the vehicle will understeer due to a lack of traction.
Vehicle’s equipped with anti-lock brakes can still understeer due to heavy braking.

 Cancer and Pisces work well together, as both are water signs. Cancer is mystified (in a good way) with Pisces's quiet vulnerability, while Pisces appreciates Cancer's sympathetic nature.
 Another water sign, Scorpio also lives in a more — let's say — rarefied realm. Scorpio and Pisces appreciate each other's depth and reasonableness. Both signs, however, can begin to show signs of frustration when the real world butts its nasty little head in and requires either sign to make compromises, be practical, and get things done.
 Virgo and Pisces share a fascination with and fondness of communication. Although Virgo can be a little bit exacting from time to time, Pisces's loyalty makes these signs quite compatible.
 A Pisces/Pisces love match could either go one of two ways: unburdened and complete love for one another, or consummate distaste. They'll either love each other because of similarities or hate each other because of similarities.
 One likes to change (Pisces) while the other likes to stay the same (Taurus). Although the stability that Taurus offers may be reassuring to Pisces, her desire to always stay the same may eventually be stifling for a Pisces that can embrace changes readily and quickly.
 This relationship will enjoy a perfect balance of comfort and compassion, and will endure a long stay together.

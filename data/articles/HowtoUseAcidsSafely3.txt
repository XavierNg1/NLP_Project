 Concentrated acids react violently with bases. By diluting the acid, you will make it easier to neutralize safely. Slowly add the acid to a large volume of water (roughly twenty times the volume of the acid).
 Use sodium carbonate to neutralize the acid. For inorganic acids, the neutralization is complete when the solution no longer bubbles as a result of adding more sodium carbonate. For organic acids, you will need to check the solution with pH strips to confirm neutralization.
 You can safely pour the acid down the sink after being neutralized. Best practice is to flush down the drain with twenty times the as much water. So, if you had 10 milliliters (0.34  fl oz) of solution, you would flush it with 200 milliliters (6.8  fl oz) of water.

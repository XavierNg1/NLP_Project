 The park jump, or ski ramp, shouldn't be enormous when you're starting to learn 360s. Try to find one that few people are using, since you'll need to be aware of other skiers when jumping.
 Your legs should be a little wider than shoulder-width apart. Balance your weight on your toes and keep your skis parallel. Lean forward with your whole body.
 You should squat and twist your arms down to the side and back in the opposite direction you intend to spin.








The windup is important since it creates a spring action. This is what allows your body to twist in mid-air., Wait to pop up a bit and turn your skis once you're in the air. Then twist your upper body in the direction you want to spin the 360.









The harder you twist, the faster you'll spin.
 At first, turn your head over your shoulder looking in the direction you are spinning. Keep your head fixed while you spin and as you release, look at where you'll land.
 Once you come around, pull your arms out and away from your body to slow down your spin.
 Shift your weight forward and avoid tensing your muscles into a locked position. Remember to relax so you can absorb the landing with your hips, knees, and ankles.Try leaning forward and bending your knees slightly to soften the landing.
 If you are intending to stop, stop at the side where you are out of the way of others. If you are intending to spin another 360, repeat these steps.

 This can be done by selecting the Forge from the main menu of the Halo: Complete Multiplayer Experience disc and selecting the Longshore map from the ones available. Gathering the Mythic skulls is infinitely easier when you are in a Forge session rather than Custom game, as this one cannot be reached without entering editor mode in Forge.;
, Make sure that if you are not host, that the player who is has enabled all players to be able to enter editor mode.
 The defenders base, the one with the machine-gun turret, is opposite the attackers base of the outer wharf and has an aircraft carrier behind it.
 This is in the vicinity of the Longshore skull and will be on the second level of the defenders base, overlooking the water. The garage door is not difficult to see, especially when walking towards the defenders base via the alley with all the stacked crates in it.
 The vent is directly to the left of the garage door and to the right of a large Fronk's fishery sign with a whale on it. The vent is located over water, so it is imperative you stay in editor mode while you find it.
 The Longshore skull will be resting there behind the vent, facing away from the main map.
 Change from editor mode back into player form by pressing UP on the D-Pad again, landing on the ledge where the skull is resting. Pick it up by pressing the Right Bunker when prompted and be careful not to fall off before you claim it. Congratulations, you just found the Longshore Skull!

, It is represented by a skull with a harpooned fish on its' forehead.

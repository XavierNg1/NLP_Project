 Separate out the stems and seeds if necessary, and use a grinder or chop up the buds with a sharp knife until they're finely chopped, but not completely powdered.
 Use a scissors to cut off the top of the bag, then empty the contents. Spoon the ground marijuana into the bag, then fold it over several times to keep the marijuana from spilling out.


If you have a metal tea ball, you can use that instead.
Or use a coffee filter: place the marijuana in the center of the filter, then gather the edges and tie it up to make a little bag.
 Add a second regular teabag if you want to enhance the flavor. Earl grey, Irish breakfast, or flavored herbal teas all taste great.
 You can do it either on the stove or in the microwave.
 The longer it steeps, the deeper the flavor of the tea will be.
 Stir in sugar, honey or milk to taste.


Note: Plain marijuana tea has a nice herbal flavor but will not produce a high, since it's necessary to extract the THC using fat to get the full effect. If you want potent marijuana tea, use a different method.

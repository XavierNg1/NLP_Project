 Unlike a full-bodied professional letter, a simple note is not likely to be more than a few sentences in length. This means you have to economize on what you have to say. Get right to the point with your message. You don't need to be near as formal here, so you can dispense with a lot of the traditional formatting, so long as you remember to state your name, and to whom you're writing.


Using a pen with legible handwriting is preferable in this case.
 In a short thank-you note, you'll have to economize on the amount of things you want to say. While making sure to say thank you is the most important thing, it's just as vital you specifically state why you're thanking the person, and how you'll put the recipient's help or advice to good use.


For example, if the recipient gave you advice on an upcoming job interview, you can say: "I'd like to thank you for all the advice you imparted regarding the interview. I'm going to keep it in mind while I'm preparing for it; I'm confident it will help me land the job!"

, Even if a post-it thank-you note is relatively informal, you shouldn't go without giving the name and date. Particularly if the individual is very busy, it may not be clear who sent the message without a name. Adding a date also helps to give the note more context and professionalism.


If space on the page is an issue, you can just go the formal route and write the date in shorthand (e.g. 09/27/15).

Fairy tales with twists – most children know the real fairy tale and it's old news; however, when it has a twist, a change of plot or a hilarious and realistic overlay, it can be a lot more fun for the kids (especially when they realize it's not the same old, same old). Think Frozen and Tangled for more modern incarnations.
Schooldays – none of the boring stuff, instead, all of the dastardly adventures schoolkids dream about getting up to; think Enid Blyton meets the 21st century with a technological bang!
Science fiction – kids love space and science weirdness, so make the most of it by drawing out this interest as the basis for your screenplay.
Action – action at the child's level is as thrilling as it is for adults.
Mystery – children love mystery plots, especially when the children are able to solve it before the well-meaning but harried adults.
Travel – it could be a race against time, a race of travelers, a journey of discovery, dragging along on a parental work trip or unearthing a treasure. Whatever it is, travel offers opportunities for great shots of wonderful places around the world, seen through a child's eyes.
Based on an existing novel. You'll need the rights to the novel, which can be fairly expensive depending on its popularity.;

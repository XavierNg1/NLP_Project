 Suits rarely come equipped with this buttonhole, which is specifically for a boutonniere, since wearing a flower in your lapel is not really in fashion. To be functional, the buttonhole should be open (not sewn shut), reinforced with stitching, and have a latch 1-2 inches below it on the back of the lapel.If your jacket is lacking any of these elements, visit a dry cleaner or anywhere they do alterations and ask them to cut a buttonhole for you.Don't do this with a rented or borrowed jacket. Just pin the boutonniere to your lapel instead.
 The stem should pass through the latch as well, which will hold the flower in place.The latch is essentially a thin cord (often silk) sewn onto the back of the lapel to help secure the flower and hold it upright., Only the flower should be seen from the front of the lapel.If the stem is too long, give it a snip so it won't peek out from under your lapel.

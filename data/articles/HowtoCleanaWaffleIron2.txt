 You can unplug it when you're finished making your waffles, and it can cool while you eat.Remove the plates from the waffle iron according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions, if you still have them. Waffle iron grid plates usually snap out easily.
 It's probably easiest to do this in your sink, but you can also use a shallow dish of warm water. Don't add any soap to the water. Nonstick plates should never be cleaned with soap because it can cause the nonstick surface to deteriorate., Again, it's important to be cognizant of the nonstick surface and use soft cleaning supplies. Use a sponge that is made specifically for nonstick surfaces, or a kitchen brush with soft bristles. You don't want to scratch up the plates while cleaning them.
 Allow the water to remove any remaining crumbs. It's great to turn the plates vertical so that the water can run through the ridges, rinsing spots you may have missed with your sponge, brush, or rag. The dishwasher can be damaging to the nonstick surface of the waffle iron, so this method is the next best thing. Check your manufacturer's instructions to see if your plates can go in the dishwasher or not., Set them on a drying rack or on a dish towel on your counter. If you're in a hurry, you can certainly use a dry cloth or paper towel to dry them more quickly. You want to make sure your plates are completely dry before snapping them back into your iron.
 Use a damp cloth to get the exterior as clean as you got the plates.Be careful to avoid getting water into the electrical parts of the iron, which could damage the iron or result in a shock next time you plug it in.

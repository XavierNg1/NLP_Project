 Swiss Army Knives are made of stainless steel, which is much more water-resistant than regular steel.However, if you get them wet, it's still best to dry them relatively quickly. If you get your knife wet: dry off every tool and the base as fast as you can. Dry it by hand, and then let it sit out to dry more thoroughly. Let it sit open for 10-30 minutes., Place a dollop of lubricating multitool oil on the blade joint when the blade is starting to stiffen. Your manual will tell you how to oil and repair it., The sharpening technique will differ slightly for straight blades and serrated blades. Use the "straight cut" method for the standard Swiss Army knife.Straight cut: Sharpen your blade using a whetstone at an angle of 15-20°. This will result in a cutting angle of 30-40°. If you are sharpening on a grinding wheel, make sure to cool the metal with plenty of water. This might help avoid high temperatures and damage to the blade.
Serrated cut: Hone the blade with a sharpening stone. Pull it across the flat side of the serrated cut at an angle of 15-20°.

 If you are sweet and caring, then don't choose a deep blue or black. Likewise, if you are secretive and mysterious, don't choose pink or neon colors. If you have a favorite color, choose that for the basic color. If you have already got a color in mind, definitely use that.;

Don't fall for the trick that lighter colors are more attractive. Look at Luna, for example; she is pretty but is quite a dark blue.
If the pony has a personality different from yours, try to think from her point of view.
If your pony has two personalities, choose both and gradient the relevant colors in.
If you feel uncomfortable choosing a color that represents her personality, that's okay!

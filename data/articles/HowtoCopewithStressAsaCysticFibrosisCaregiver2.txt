 If you haven’t done so already, gather as much information as possible about the disease. Talk to the CF care team and ask for resources. Consult the websites of CF organizations for reliable information.Try finding information on the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation’s website: https://www.cff.org.
Since ensuring your loved one’s nutrition is essential, try looking up recipes and diet tips: http://www.cfliving.com/resources/recipes-nutrition.jsp

Educating yourself about the disease will empower you and ensure you can offer the best care possible.
 Incorporate treatment regimens into your family’s daily routine, but try not to let treatment be the focus. Think of treatments as a step in a daily routine, like brushing teeth or hair, instead of letting them dictate your family’s daily schedule.Ask your loved one with CF to offer input on developing a daily routine. Ask them, “Where is the best place to do airway clearance? Would you like to do it in the living room so you can watch television?”
Be sure to include nutrition and regular snacks and meals when planning your caregiving schedule.
 Deal with bills and forms as you receive them, especially if you’re the parent of a child with CF. Be sure to set aside some time weekly to deal with these. Do not wait for free time to open up. Avoid letting these pile up, as staying proactive and organized will keep them from becoming overwhelming.Consult the CF care team if you need help understanding a medical bill. Call your insurance provider if you have any questions about coverage.

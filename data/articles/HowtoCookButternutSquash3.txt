 Here's what you'll need to make mashed butternut squash:


1 large butternut squash
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste

, Use a vegetable peeler or a paring knife to peel the skin off of the squash., This will make it easy to remove the seeds and pulp from the squash.
 Use a large spoon so scrape out the insides of the squash, removing the seeds and pulp.
, Cover the cubes with water and bring the water to a boil. Cook the squash until it's tender when you pierce it with a fork, for about 10-15 minutes.
 Use a strainer to remove the excess liquid from the squash.
 Use an electric mixer or a hand masher to mash the squash until it reaches a coarse consistency.
 Drizzle 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of brown sugar onto the squash, and season it with salt and pepper to taste.
 This will blend the ingredients into the squash as well as change its texture.
 Enjoy this mashed squash immediately, while it's hot. You can eat it on its own or as a side with chicken, beef, or veggies.

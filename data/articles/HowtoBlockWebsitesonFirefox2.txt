 This file allows you to reroute certain websites to a local address, effectively blocking them. This will affect all users on the computer. Editing the hosts file is only really effective when there are just a few sites you want to block.


Windows - Navigate to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc and double-click the hosts file. If prompted to select a program to open it in, select "Notepad."
macOS - Open the Terminal program from the Utilities folder. Type sudo nano /etc/hosts and enter your password when prompted. This will open it in an editor.
 You'll be adding websites you want to block to new lines at the end of the file.
 For example, if you want to block Facebook, type 127.0.0.1 www.facebook.com.
 You can continue adding new lines to the file, each with a new site to block. Make sure to include 127.0.0.1 for each line.


You'll want to block the mobile versions of sites too. For example, if you blocked Facebook earlier, you'll also want to block m.facebook.com.
 Once you're finished editing the file, you'll need to save the changes:


Windows - Press Ctrl+S or select "Save" from the File menu.
macOS - Press Ctrl+X and select "Yes" when prompted to save. Use the same filename to overwrite the original.
 After changing the hosts file, you can try loading the website in any browser and it will redirect to a blank page. This will work for all users on that computer, and will also work in Private Browsing.

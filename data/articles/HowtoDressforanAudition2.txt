 Choose something you can move around best in. With this, you can still imply a certain character, but the last thing you want to do is have to dance in a Maxi skirt.


While you want to be comfortable, make sure to follow any clothing rules that the directors mention. For example, if you are going to a ballet audition, you should wear a leotard and tights.
Look professional. Even though you might have a really cute pair of dance shorts or a comfy hoodie, you should wear what is appropriate for the audition. This will make you stand out against the other dancers, and look more professional to the directors.
 Go into the audition wearing Jazz shoes, Character heels, or ballet flats. You won't waste time then by having to change from your Uggs into your dance shoes. Just come with them on, even if that means you have to walk across the street in them (if you do not own any type of dance shoe, wear athletic sneakers). Make sure to choose the best pair of shoes that are appropriate for the type of dance you will be performing.
 The casting director(s) don't want to see your hair flying all over the place while you dance. They want to see your face! Even if you hate to put your hair in a ponytail, it will look way better if you do. Hey, how bad do you want this? Is putting your hair up really going to stand in your way of getting a part? Doing a bun is very important for a ballet audition.

 Without dedication, you will most likely give up. This journey is not short, but all the while it's worth it.;
, It's critical that you do so. if you don't, your hair will be dry and brittle and break off easily.
 Wearing protective hair styles like braids, twists, sew ins, etc. gives your hair a break so it won't be strained. This will also help keep your hair up and out the way and give it time to grow.
 It’s essential to not put heat onto your hair, as the heat will dry up, burn and/or break off your hair. Also the heat could ruin your hair texture. Don't flat iron your new growth to fit your permed hair, just wear a protective hair style, like those I listed above.
 Treatments like hot oil and Tea Tree oil will do just fine. Deep conditioning will help strengthen your hair. Try to deep condition as much as possible!

, This does not mean cutting all of your hair out. Go to a professional if you do not feel comfortable doing it yourself. You do this because once your hair begins to grow, it will replace the permed/relaxed hair. Doing this will get the perm/relaxed hair out your hair completely. Once your hair begins to grow, you will notice a difference in your natural hair and your permed/relaxed hair. Your natural hair will be relatively stronger than your permed/relaxed hair; you don’t want your old hair to damage your new hair, that’s why you cut the permed/relaxed hair off.
 Your health plays a big part in the way your hair skin and nails grow.

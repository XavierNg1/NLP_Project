 Cut out two pieces of outside fabric and another two pieces of lining fabric in the shape of a stocking. It will be better if the outside fabric is a combination of red and green which can reflect the feeling of Christmas, so you can make a patchwork to achieve this.;
, Place two outside fabrics face to face and stitch it along the edges. Make sure to leave an opening for the mouth.
 Do the same to sew two lining fabrics. You need to leave a hole a few inches wide at the bottom of the lining fabric to turn the stocking through.
 Sew two mouths together along the edge. Turn the stocking inside out and sew the hole at the lining fabric.
 Sew a lace trim around the mouth. Make a bow knot with lace trim and sew it on the stocking. Or you can add some other embellishments.

 The easiest way to make a vest is to take clothes that fit your rabbit and to sew a metal loop onto the back between the shoulder blades. Make sure the metal loop is solid and well attached, so that it will not break or break off., Bunny patterns can be a bit hard to find, but you can use patterns for cats as a substitute. Use a string to measure your bunny at his neck, chest behind his front legs, and a few inches further back on his torso to make sure you get a pattern that will fit your pet. When finished with the vest, sew a ring on the back to attach the leash.
 Again, you will need to take measurements at your bunny’s neck, chest behind the legs, and a few inches further back on his torso. You can then start with a piece of breathable, flexible cloth.Cut the cloth to the appropriate dimensions. You’ll want to leave a little extra fabric for attachments. If the vest will attach with Velcro or buttons, the two sides will need to overlap completely.
Wrap the cut cloth around your bunny, and mark where his legs are.
Cut out holes for the legs.
Reinforce all edges of the fabric, including the leg holes, by folding the fabric over and sewing it down.
Attach Velcro, clasps, buttons, or zippers.
Sew a ring onto the top of the vest between your bunny’s shoulders.

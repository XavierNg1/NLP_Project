 Cubes are rectangular prisms (boxes) in which every side length and angle is equal. Thus, the volume of a cube can be written as length × width × depth = length × length × length = length3. To get your answer in cubic inches, ensure your length measurement is in inches.
 Cylinders are smooth-sided objects with two circular faces of equal size. The formula v = hπr2 where v = volume, h = height, and r = the cylinder's radius (the distance from the center of either of the circular faces to its edge) gives the volume of a cylinder. Make sure your measurements for h and r are in inches.
 Cones are smooth-sided objects with a circular base that tapers to a point. The formula v = hπr2/3 where v = volume, h = height, and r = the radius of the circular base gives the volume of a cone. As above, ensure your measurements for h and r are in inches.
 Spheres are perfectly round 3-d objects. The equation v = 4/3πr3 where v = volume and r = the radius of the sphere (the distance from its center to its edge) gives the volume of a sphere. As before, make sure your measurement for r is in inches.

 If you have any questions or need advice, drop into "the Lounge" and ask away;
,, This is essential to make it in the Premium side of FixYa

, Only open those you have some experience on.
 They will always give you a fair and reasonable answer, so please don't then become offended if you are told your solution needs more work.
 There will always be opinions on who is right and wrong, but keep it technical and directly based on the problem/solutions given. Go to the lounge for open discussion if you feel that a wrong must be corrected.
 You may think that there is an advantage to be gained by this, but in reality there is not. The client will just pass over any place holding posts, in turn ignoring any future comments you may have, making it harder to get a FixYa.
 If your spelling, vocabulary or grammar is not good, it may become very hard for people to clearly understand your solution, or you to understand theirs. If you have problems here, it may mean contributing customer paying premium posts is not the place for you. We all learned English at some point, just learn some more if you find communication difficult in the solution threads.
 Although the solution to a problem may not have a copyright on it, the body of work written describing that solution does have a copyright to the producer of that work. This sort of practice will lead to banning at FixYa, particularly when you have cut and pasted word for word from another website. your solutions must be in your own words as detailed in the Expert Terms of Service.
 FixYa have forbid this practice and banned people for doing it.

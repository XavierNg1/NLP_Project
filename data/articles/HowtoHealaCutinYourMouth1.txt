 If the cut in your mouth is bleeding, start by rinsing your mouth with cool water. Swish the water around in your mouth, making sure to swish it around the area with the cut. This helps remove the blood and help to stop the bleeding., If rinsing your mouth doesnâ€™t stop the bleeding, you can apply pressure to the cut with a piece of gauze. Gently press against the cut for a few minutes to stop the bleeding., Pressing a cold compress or ice against the bleeding cut can also help stop the bleeding. Wrap the ice in a cloth and put it against the cut. This helps reduce inflammation and constrict the blood vessels, which will help stop the bleeding.

 Any microwave-safe mug or bowl will work fine.
 Dip a paper towel in a little bit of vegetable or olive oil and smear the oil around the inside of the bowl. You could also spray the mug or bowl with non-stick cooking spray. Melting butter into the bowl is another option.
 Be careful so you don't break the yolk.
 You can use cream if you prefer creamier scrambled eggs.
 Mix up the yolk, the white and the milk until the mixture is pale yellow and smooth.
 Use a microwave-safe plate or a paper towel.
 Place it in the microwave and cook it for 45 seconds, then remove it from the microwave.
 Remove the cover and stir the mixture to fluff up the eggs. Add a tablespoon of shredded cheese, a small handful of scallions, or another topping if you'd like.
 Check to see that the egg is set. If it still looks runny, give it another 15 seconds., Use a fork to fluff it up. Your scrambled egg is ready to eat.

 Only let your dog sniff one hand. He will most likely become excited when he realizes that the treat is for him, but it's important to ignore his attempts at getting the treat., The most important part of this exercise is to ignore your dog until he stops actively trying to get the treat. Keep saying "leave it" until he responds to your command. It may take a moment, but eventually he should give up and sit in front of you., Once your dog has stopped pursuing the treat he knew you had, say "good boy," and give him the treat from your other hand. It's important that you not give your dog the treat used when you say "leave it," as this will only teach your dog that he will eventually get whatever you tell him to leave., It's important to be consistent in your training. Repeat the process until your dog immediately backs away from your hand when you tell him to leave it., Once your dog has mastered the "leave it" command, you can begin to use that command around your cat. You should still be cautious and supervise both animals, as your dog may have learned to leave a treat but may be less willing to leave something he perceives as prey. Be patient, and continue training until your dog learns to leave the cat alone on command.

 This will form the basis for the rose hair bow.
 The instructions for making these are at: How to make ribbon roses. Use ribbon of a color that is either a lighter or darker hue of the ribbon, or a contrasting yet complementary color.
 Either sew or glue the ribbon roses onto the hair bow. The arrangement is up to your preference, but here are some suggestions:


Do a row of ribbon roses from one end of the bow to the other. Keep them in a perfectly straight line.
Glue a small round belt buckle (without the buckle) or a similar flat round object to the center of the hair bow. Glue the ribbon roses around this circle, covering it completely.
Glue or sew a bunch of ribbon roses to the center part of the hair bow.
Glue or sew ribbon roses just on the edges of the hair bow.
 This simple yet effective rose hair bow is easy to make and fun to wear.

 Remove any mold and excess curing mix from the ham by using a cloth and some vinegar.
 The curing process should completely cure the ham by the beginning of April.
 Place it in a stockinette and let it hang in the same well-ventilated area where you cured it. Age the ham for 3 to 6 months so it achieves more flavor.

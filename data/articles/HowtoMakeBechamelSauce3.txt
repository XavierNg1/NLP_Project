 Whisk it in quickly to moisten the roux. Be sure to distribute it will throughout the roux; the mixture should now be slightly wet, but not runny.
 Slowly pour the remaining milk into the pan with one hand while whisking with the other hand. Continue pouring and whisking until the milk is gone, then keep stirring for a few more minutes.
 The thick, creamy, white sauce that remains may be seasoned with salt and pepper. Pour it over steamed vegetables or rice and serve immediately, or use it as the base for another dish.

 Fill your sink, bucket or tub with room temperature water. Do not fill water to the very top of the bucket.
 Try not to use any tools such as sponges, clothes or brushes to wash your bra. The softness and control of your hands will be enough to clean your bra.
 Don't use any soap with harsh chemicals because it will ruin the softness and/or the colour of your VS bra. Victoria's Secret has many vibrant colours of bras and some detergents may fade them.
 Try to air dry you bras as much as possible. Victoria's Secret bras often shrink if they are put in the dryer. Hang the bra up by the straps or clasps and wait at least 12 hours before wearing the bra.

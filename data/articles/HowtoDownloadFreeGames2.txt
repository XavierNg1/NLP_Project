 Abandonware are games that were released by now defunct companies. Most of these games are legally free, though some operate in a legal gray-area due to the fact that someone may still hold the rights. Popular sites include:

XTC Abandonware

, Most abandonware sites categorize their libraries by genre and release date. Browse through your favorite genre and look for a game that you want to try.


Check old reviews to see how the game played back when it was released.
 Most sites will provide instructions for installing the games on modern operating systems, as well as instructions for bypassing old CD key checks.
 Modern operating systems may not be able to run the games correctly. Oftentimes, old games donâ€™t work properly with widescreen monitors, or with modern graphics cards. Abandonware sites may provide information on how to fix these issues, but you may need to track down specific fixes yourself.


Use a web search with the game title and the specific problem you are having. You will often find forums with fixes posted by community members.

 Fatigue is a common early sign of pregnancy. Even when you have not changed your routine or sleep schedule, you may feel tired throughout the day. Unexplained fatigue can be an early sign of pregnancy., You may not experience food cravings right away. However, early on in pregnancy you may suddenly develop an aversion to certain foods. You may dislike the smell of a food or drink you once enjoyed or did not mind.For example, you may wake up one morning and be nauseated by the smell of your morning coffee brewing.
 Pregnancy hormones can cause changes in mood early on. You may notice you get angry or frustrated more easily or are very emotional. You may cry over sad commercials or television shows more easily.These mood swings may be similar to what you experience just before your menstrual cycle.

 Freezing works best for small votive holders or candle jars. Once your candle has cooled to normal room temperature, place it in the freezer.









If you put it in when it's too hot, you'll risk cracking the glass from too quick of a temperature shift. Make sure the glass is cool to the touch before you freeze it.;
, As the wax and glass begin to freeze, the wax will begin to contract and separate from the sides of the glass, pulling away and making it much easier to remove.
 Remove the glass from the freezer after an hour has passed and try to tap the wax out on the palm of your hand. Use your finger or a dull knife to scrape and remove the remaining wax from the glass.
 Remove any small remaining pieces of wax residue using a cotton ball or cotton swab soaked in baby oil or vinegar.Rubbing with a slightly damp paper-towel can be just as effective. It might take some elbow-grease, but it should come up.

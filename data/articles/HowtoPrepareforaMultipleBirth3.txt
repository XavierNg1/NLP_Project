 Once your multiples are born, you will probably be too busy caring for them to spend time baby-proofing your home. Try to get at least the basics done ahead of time:Cover electrical outlets
Install baby-proof cabinet locks
Pad hard corners or edges of furniture
Install baby gates at the bottoms and tops of staircases
Strap down heavy furniture, like TVs, bookcases, and dressers

, Buying and assembling the necessary products in advance will save you the stress and time of preparing the nursery once the babies arrive. Keep in mind that you need to purchase supplies and furniture that can accommodate multiple babies.


Very young multiple babies can sleep together in the same crib. Depending on how many babies you are expecting, you may not need to purchase more than one crib.Keep in mind that your multiples will likely be born pre-term, and therefore smaller than your average singleton newborn. Consider buying clothes, diapers, and swaddling cloths designed for pre-term babies.
 Many new mothers of multiples need help caring for the babies during the first few months. If you are able, start interviewing nannies, babysitters, family members, or neighbors before the babies are born so that you have a go-to helper when the time comes.


Consider hiring assistance even for just a few hours each day in the first several weeks after delivery. This will give you time to rest and recover or get things done around the house.

Trace the outline of your board in the sand.
Make a few marks where your feet should ideally land.
Do a few push-ups with the final one resulting in a jump up, trying to land your feet on those marks (centre fin rear and n/e/w/s centre of board).
Doing this often on land, even in your living room with a chalk outline will make the motion automatic.

Lie down on your board. Ask yourself how it feels.
Imagine the dune is moving forward, pushing you, lifting you to your feet.
Put your hands down palm flat, just on the inside of the rails, approx. two fifths of the way down from the nose (depending on the board).
Then jump in one motion to your feet, trying to land with you back foot centered between the rear fin(s) and your front foot in the center of the board.
Do this drill as often as possible, until the move is automatic.

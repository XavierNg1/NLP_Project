 MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) is a Windows service that requires the use of Windows Media Player, a media program that comes built-in to every copy of Windows. Windows Media Player must be upgraded to at least Version 10, and you must be running Windows XP SP 2 or newer (Vista, 7, or 8).;
, Open Windows Media Player. Click the arrow under “Library” and then select “Add to Library…” from the drop down menu. Select “My personal folders” to have Windows Media Player automatically search the most likely places for your music to be stored.


If you want to tell it exactly where to search, click “Advanced Options >>” and manually select your music folders.
Windows Media Player will build a library of your music.
 Windows will automatically begin installing device drivers so that you can access your phone’s files through Windows. This process may take several minutes.
 This name will be displayed in Windows Media Player whenever the phone is connected.


You are given the option to sync automatically or not. If you select automatic, Windows Media Player will transfer any music to your phone that is not already onto your phone.
After the initial setup, your phone will sync automatically every time you connect it. Songs that have been added to your computer since your last sync will be transferred over, and anything added to your phone that is not on your computer will be transferred back.
 To change what is synced, or to change your automatic sync preferences, right-click on your device in the left frame and click “Set Up Sync…” This will open the “Device Setup” window. When “Sync this device automatically” is checked, you can specify which playlists you would like to automatically sync.


By default, every playlist on your computer is selected, including the “All Music” playlist.

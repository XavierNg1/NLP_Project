 Once you are certified and have a solid grip of the rules of the game, you will begin by officiating children’s games. Many referees start at the middle school level, serving as the referee in games for 6th, 7th, and 8th graders.Officiating younger kid’s games provide you with an opportunity to develop a sound understanding of game mechanics and the officiating process.
Younger kid’s games tend to be slower paced, which allows beginner officials more time to learn the process.
 Basketball games are officiated by a single lead referee and two umpires. Until you are a more established referee, you will serve as one of the two umpires. Lead referees are great resources to learn more about the game and officiating.


Aside from your umpire duties, pay attention to how the lead referee manages the game to learn the process.
Ask the lead referee and other more experienced referees questions in order to improve your ability to officiate.
 Being a referee in basketball games requires continuous learning. Because such a thorough understanding of the rules is required in order to perform adequately and the rules can change, be added or removed every year, it’s important that you continue to attend training as you develop your officiating skills.Attend officiating clinics or training programs offered through your local sports organization or the private sector.
Increasing your officiating credentials will make it easier to transition to serving as a referee in higher level games.

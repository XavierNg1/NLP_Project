 Just because you hear a buzzing sound doesn’t mean that it’s a fly roaming around you. Beware of bees and wasps. You shouldn’t kill these bugs because they are important for the environment and can sting you.


Also beware of a horse fly. A horse fly is larger than an average house fly and can bite.;
, Once you’ve identified the fly, take a survey of your environment and the supplies nearby. If you have a counter nearby, you can use it as a hard surface to squash the bug on., If you’re going to catch this fly with your bare hands, you’ll need to be able to follow the bug with your eyes. When flies are indoors they usually try to escape and are tricked by windows. This is where they’ll usually be unless there is rotting food nearby.
 After following the fly’s behaviour and where it is spending its time, prepare to strike. Consider before killing the fly if there is an alternative to ridding the fly from your personal space. Outline the perimeter of the fly with your eyes.


Move slowly to a place you’ll have the leverage to strike., Once you’ve positioned yourself close enough to the fly, it’s time to kill. Make sure both your hands are free. Take a quick jab at the fly. The aim is to wedge the hard surface the fly is resting on with your palm.


Have your other hand ready to go if you miss the fly. This way you can slam the other hand onto the fly in a flash., If you are successful in killing the fly, you need to wash your hands thoroughly. Use antibacterial soap for the most efficient wash. Dispose of the fly in a napkin into the trash. Wash the smudge off the wall as needed.

 Secure the paper under the lid with wrapping paper.


If the lid is small enough, you can use scrapbooking paper instead.;
, If your paper is a light color, use white nylons. If your paper is a dark color, use black nylons. Cut the nylons towards the top, where they are wider. This will ensure that they are wide enough for your lid.


If you can find colored nylons, choose a color that matches your wrapping paper. For example, use green nylons if you have green wrapping paper.
For a fancier earring holder, use lacey nylons instead.
 Try to center it as much as possible, so that there are 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of nylon hanging off to either side of the lid.
 You don't have to worry about being too neat; this will be the back of your earring holder, and invisible once you hang it.
 Measure the width of your lid, then cut a piece of ribbon according to that measurement.
 To make the loop more secure, tie the ends of the ribbon into a knot first, then glue it down.
 Your holder is now ready to use. You can now stick your hook earrings through the nylons.

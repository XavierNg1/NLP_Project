 If your character has a fairly decent level, you can offer party assistance to low-level players. You can form a group and accompany other weaker players to dungeon levels that they won’t be able to get to without the help of a stronger player like you. This allows them to kill higher-level monsters and gain more experience points that they need to level up. You can ask for a couple thousand as payment for your service.
 If you’re a priest, you can offer to heal wounded players instantly in exchange for a decent amount of Zeny. Most of the time, players forget to purchase potions while they’re on their quest. Keep in mind though that only a Priest or a High Priest has the skill to heal other players.
 Another service that you can offer to other players if you’re of the Priest job is the Resurrection. Players that are out on a hunt will be reluctant to reload the game once they’re killed because they’ll have to respawn back to the dungeon entrance. Approach characters that are lying dead on the ground, and make an offer that you’ll resurrect them in exchange for a fair price.

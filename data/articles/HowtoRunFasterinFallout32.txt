 The easiest thing you can do to improve speed is to set your character's Agility to max. Alongside Intelligence, Agility is one of Fallout 3's most important attributes. You'll end up going faster, and you'll also get more Action Points for the VATS system.


Keep in mind that an imbalanced character can incur its own challenges. Attribute points you're giving to Agility will be coming out of somewhere else, so it's recommended you take the time to consider whether speed is important making the game more difficult in other areas.
 Weight capacity is calculated via several factors, not least of all being your character's Strength attribute. Setting a high Strength will mean your character can hold significantly more before having to slow down.


Choosing the "Strong Back" perk later in the game will also significantly help the weight carry issue. , Command codes only work if you're working with a PC; however, they're the fastest way you can increase a character's speed. First, press the ~ key, then type "fmoverunmult #", with the number standing in for whatever speed you choose. This technically counts as cheating, but if you're looking for a simple way of increasing speed, command codes are just the thing.


Inputting "player.modav carryweight #" and changing your weight capacity will solve any issues if you're constantly going over your weight limit.
 Again, this technically counts as cheating, but there are mods out there for virtually every issue in Fallout 3. Look on some of the Fallout 3-specific and modding websites. There are several speed-altering mods available for the PC.

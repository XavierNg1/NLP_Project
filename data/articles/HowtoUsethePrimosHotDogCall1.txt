 See all the different calls that are there. If you don't see 15 different calls (in bold lettering), download the PDF of it to your iPod touch or smartphone and look at that. The PDF is found at www.primos.com.
 If you already threw it away, look carefully on the mouthpiece for the letters A, B, C and D.
 They are used for both male and female coyote calls. Place your lips somewhere on the mouthpiece and blow quick bursts of air into it, as if saying "bark."

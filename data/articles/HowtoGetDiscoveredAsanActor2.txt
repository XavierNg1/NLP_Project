 Taking on a lot of acting roles will improve your odds of being discovered in two ways. First, taking on all the roles you can will give you lots of experience and a robust resume. Second, being on stage or on camera will allow you to meet more people in the industry and keep your name circulating among industry professionals and the public.For instance, if you have time, take on two or more small parts at once.
If you’re involved in a project as a lead actor, consider taking on another project at the same time in a smaller supporting role.
 With each role you take on, work to express a greater emotional depth and expand your dramatic capabilities. Ask directors what sort of performance they want from you, and push yourself to meet their demands and expectations.Scripts can be ready in many different ways. Try performing a given scene in slightly (or even radically) different ways. Ask other actors and production crew which version of the scene they like best.
 Some people scoff at small roles or roles as extras. But these minor (and sometimes even uncredited) roles could help you form connections with other actors, directors, or industry insiders, and they allow you the opportunity to impress others with your acting and professionalism. If you’re offered even a small role, eagerly accept it.For instance, if you audition for a lead role but are offered only a minor or supporting role, you should take it even though it is not the role you wanted.
 Many directors and producers are constantly on the prowl for people who have a particular “look,” and sometimes recruit people in situations that have nothing to do with acting. If you receive an invitation to audition for a film while, for instance, walking down the street, you should take it.If a director or producer approaches you while you’re shopping at the mall, buying groceries in the store, or enjoying a vacation, thank them and follow up on their offer.

 After you apply for family medical leave, your employer must respond within five days, telling you whether you are eligible. If you are denied, your employer must give a reason for the denial. Your determination letter will state that reason.
 If you are granted leave, your employer must return you to the same or similar job once you return to work. Although the job does not have to be identical, it must be “nearly identical.” The new position must:


involve the same or substantially similar responsibilities, duties, and status
carry the same general level of skill, effort, responsibility, and authority
offer identical pay, overtime, and bonus opportunities
offer identical benefits (life, health, and disability insurance, sick leave, vacation, pensions, etc.)
offer the same general work schedule at the same or a nearby location

, To facilitate the complaint process, you should gather necessary information ahead of time. You will need the following:your name, address, and phone number
the name of the company where you work
the location of the company
the name of your manager or the company owner
the circumstances of your FMLA request and your employer’s response

, To lodge a complaint, you should contact the Department of Labor’s Wage-and-Hour Division. Call 1-866-487-9243. You will be directed to the nearest office for assistance.

 Choose a safe and gentle cleanser to clean your tub out. This will prevent dirt and grime from building up. Just wet a soft cloth or sponge with antibacterial dish soap and it to scrub the entire tub. Rinse the tub to completely remove the dirt and soap.


You can use a mild antibacterial soap that you'd use for hand washing your dishes. This is gentle enough to regularly use on your acrylic tub.
 You should deep clean your acrylic tub occasionally, especially if you notice hard-water deposits or grime that's difficult to wash away with soap and water. Read labels to find a tub cleaner that's safe to use on acrylic. You can also check with your tub manufacturer for a list of approved commercial cleaners to use on the tub.Most tub manufacturers update their approved cleaner list every few years, so ensure that you find the most recent list available.
 Most commercial cleaning products will have you spray the product. Keep the bottle about 4 to 6-inches (10 to 15 cm) from the tub as you spray. Let the cleaner sit on the tub for 30 seconds to a few minutes. Rinse the cleanser off and wipe the tub dry with a soft cloth.


Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning the tub.
 Acrylic tubs can scratch easily, even from chemical cleaners. This is why it's important to avoid using aerosol cleaners that come in cans or solvents (like acetone). You should also avoid using abrasive sponges that can scratch or damage the acrylic tub.If you're unsure if a product is safe to use, only use it if it says it's safe to use on acrylic surfaces.

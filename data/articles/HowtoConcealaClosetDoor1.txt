 Your new closet door/bookshelf will be bigger than the 1 you already have, so make sure there is enough space in the room.
 Draw a diagram of a shelving unit with approximately 4 to 5 shelves, depending upon your preference.

If you believe there will not be space in your room for 5.5 inch (14 cm) shelves, you can make them more shallow. This will still give the effect of a bookshelf, but may only be suitable for knick knacks instead of books.
You will need to account for the fact that your top shelf pieces must be the exact width of the door, while your shelves will need to be 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) skinnier to account for 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) plywood on each side. Subtract 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from the side shelf panels to account for the same measurement.
 Buy 2 to 3 sheets of 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) plywood. One home improvement source recommends using birch veneer plywood., You will need a work table and an outlet for a circular saw., When using a saw, you will need safety goggles and a breathing mask. It is always a good idea to wear a long-sleeved shirt and long pants.

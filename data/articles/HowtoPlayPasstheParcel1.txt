 Place a gift at the centre of the parcel.


Use a small box if you want an even shape or to make it look larger than it is.
Wrap as many layers as players, with some to spare in case more players turn up.
The parcel should be large enough for at least a 5 minute game, so add more layers even when you have only a few players; it just means they get more turns.;
,, All the players should be seated comfortably and close enough to the person each side of them that they can pass the parcel quickly.
 This person will be responsible for turning the music on and off. It should be someone who is able to keep an eye on the players and stop the music in a fair way that allows everyone a turn at unwrapping. It is a little tricky because the music-keeper must be able to both see the players but at the same time, players should not be able to see the movements of the music-keeper getting ready to stop the music.
 The music-keeper plays the music and stops it when least expected.


The player holding the parcel unwraps a layer. If the parcel was midway in the air between exchanges, the parcel goes to the player it was being passed to.
 The music-keeper starts the music again. This continues until all the layers have been removed.
 The player who unwraps the last layer keeps the item.

Google Adwords is one of the best web-based marketing services available today and it can help you generate Internet mortgage leads. You only pay when readers click on a link to your own Website., Depending on the platform you choose, you will need to design a video (Gold Media) or standard text copy (Adwords). Remember that you are creating the campaign for a mobile phone, so the space will be limited. For Adwords, the text can include your phone number. This option allows your potential customer to call you directly rather than filling out a form on your website.This will cost you some money but advertising directed at web users has a large Return On Investment (ROI). If you are not confident in designing a campaign, you can hire a graphic designer and/or a copywriter.
 Your budget will depend greatly on the type of results you want. A starting budget could be $25-100 per day depending upon how many people click on your Website. Remember to do keyword research first so that you can plan accordingly. Test various keywords on an Internet search and see what results you get.

 This guide is primarily designed for adding apps from your computer to a linked Android device.


Connect your device to your computer before you begin, unless using your device to shop.
If you're shopping with the Google Play Store (aka Android Market) app on your device, the process is simpler. Tap the icon to get started.
 It can be found at https://play.google.com/store.


From the menu on the left, select Android Apps.
 Click “All Top Free Apps” at the bottom of the category to view the most popular free Android apps. Your results will be limited to the top 480 most popular free apps.
 If you have some idea of what you want, click the “Categories” tab at the top left of the screen to see a list of categories, including several game categories and a long list of non-game categories.


Choose the category you're interested in.
Look for the tab that reads “Top Free” in the middle of the screen, near the top, next to the “Top Paid” tab.
Click the tab to browse the top 480 free apps for the category you chose.
 If you know the name of the app you want, use the search bar to look for it directly. Enter the name of the app into the bar and hit enter.
 Click the gray “Install” button to retrieve the app. If you haven't accessed the store with your device before, you will be prompted to do so now.


Once the store knows what device you're using, download the app. It should install directly to your phone.

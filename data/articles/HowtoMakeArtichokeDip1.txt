 Artichoke dip cooks quickly, and you can even throw it in before the oven has finished heating if you prepare it in time.;
, If you do not have spray, drip a little olive oil on a paper towel and wipe it along the sides and bottom of your dish. This will prevent the dip from sticking later on.
 Make sure you drain the liquid out of the can before cutting. You want chunks around than the size of quarters.
 These pieces will be slightly smaller. The finer you chop them, the less noticeable they will be in the final dish.


For vegetable-based dips, chop your green onions, roasted red peppers, or extra spinach and add them as well.
 While you can experiment with different combinations, you want between 1 1/2 and 2 cups of liquid total. Mayonnaise is the most common wet ingredient.


For classic dip, use 1 1/2 cups mayonnaise and 8 ounces cream cheese.
For rich dip, use 1 cup mayonnaise, 1/2 cup sour cream, and 16 ounces cream cheese
For lite dip, use 1/3 cup lite mayonnaise and 8 ounces lite cream cheese.
 You want everything to be well mixed and coated with cream.


If you are adding other cheeses, like shredded mozzarella, add them now.
 Artichoke dip is a simple dish that is easily customized with a few spices or changes. Don't worry about "ruining" the cooking process, as from here you will mostly just heat the dip up.


Crushed red pepper, cayenne, or hot sauce makes a spicier dip
Lemon juice and dill give the dip a slight Mediterranean flavor.
 Leave at least 1/2 an inch between the rim of the dish and the tip, as it will bubble up as it cooks.
 Be sure to check your dip periodically, and be careful removing the dip when it is finished. If you smell smoke or the top is burning, remove the dip immediately and turn off the oven.
 After it has cooled for 5-10 minutes, serve your artichoke dip with something to dip into it -- like pita chips, crackers, cut vegetables, or sliced baguettes.

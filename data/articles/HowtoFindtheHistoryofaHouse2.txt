 Libraries are a wonderful source of information regarding your community, since most local libraries preserve newspapers, photographs, maps and other town records from the past. Ask your librarian for assistance in locating historical archives. Look for pictures of your neighborhood, as well as newspaper articles or other records about it. Researching the history of your entire town or neighborhood can also provide you with clues. Be sure to ask your librarian for recommendations of books dealing with local history, and let them know you are researching your home's history. They are likely to have experience helping others with such research.
 In many communities with historical homes and other buildings, historical societies are established to promote research and education about community history. These societies can be a great resource for finding documents and information about your home, about the previous owners, and about the community in general.


To locate historical societies in your area, simply search the internet for "historical society" followed by the name of your town.
 If you have managed to track the history of your home to a specific contractor or architect responsible for its construction, then you can check to see if they are still in business. If so, then they may have records of the construction of your home, including building plans., While building inspectors typically inspect homes for the purposes of evaluating the home's structural integrity, they are also often familiar with architectural styles and details which may be unfamiliar to you. If your home has been recently inspected, get in touch with your building inspector and ask about the original construction and style of the house.

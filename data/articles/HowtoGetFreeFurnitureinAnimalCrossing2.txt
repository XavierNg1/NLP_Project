 The trees you’d want to shake down are the ones without any fruit hanging on the branches. They come in 2 variants, the upright “triangular” cedar and the traditional branched oak., Go up to the tree and press A (or tap them in Wild World and New Leaf) to shake the tree, and if you’re lucky, you’ll have either a Bell bag or a leaf (signifying a piece of furniture) fall down to the ground!

You can also shake down fruit trees for their fruits as well, not only is it a good way to make quick money early on, sometimes a villager will request a fruit and give you a reward, hopefully furniture, in return.
 Do this by pressing B (or by tapping them again in WW and NL), and enjoy!, There are about 5 Beehives hidden in two random trees per day too, and if you disturb them they start stinging! But don’t worry, all that happens is that you’ll get a miserable expression on your face and a swollen eye, which could be removed by buying medicine from the town store or by saving and quitting your game, and then playing again.

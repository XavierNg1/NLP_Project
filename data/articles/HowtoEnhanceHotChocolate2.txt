 Cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves can all add interesting flavors to your hot chocolate. You can also try cardamom, though go easy on it, as it can be strong. You can add a dash of spice to the mix or pour in a bit of extract to enhance the flavor., While cinnamon might seem a natural addition to hot chocolate, cayenne pepper or chili powder may not seem as natural. However, many cultures add a hint of spice to chocolate. Just a small pinch will do, as you don't want it to be burning hot, just a bit warming., Nothing's quite as warming as a warm drink with a bit of booze, and hot chocolate is no exception. Try adding creme de cacao, Irish cream, or cognac to your hot chocolate, or even a splash of amaretto or raspberry liqueur.A touch of stout can also be a nice addition.
 Another way to add flavor is to simply spike it with a bit of your favorite extract. You could add vanilla, for instance, or a bit of almond extract. Peppermint is, of course, a classic addition to chocolate. You could also try raspberry, banana, or amaretto.

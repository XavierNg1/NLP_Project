 A good way to cut expenses is to reduce your inventory by not carrying as many different product lines. Monitor your cash flow monthly if not weekly and project revenue and expenses for three months out. Reduce your number of employees as a last resort as it will affect your future employee loyalty. Rather, look into shortening hours, job sharing or reassigning responsibilities., This is not the time to try and save money by cutting back on your marketing efforts. If you can't afford print ads utilize social media to advertise sales and other special promotions. Hire additional sales people who will work on straight commission.
 Postpone purchases of large equipment or computers unless it will affect company sales. Downsize the space you rent or own and see if you can sublet space to another tenant., Ensure your customers are paying on time by being in frequent contact with them. Try to lock in long term contracts with discounts or prepayment terms.

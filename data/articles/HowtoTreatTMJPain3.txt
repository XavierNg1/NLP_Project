 The TMJ works like a hinge, but also uses a sliding motion. The joint also has cartilage, including a small disc of cartilage that acts as a sort of shock absorber. This disc can become damaged by arthritis, injury, or infection, or the disc can be out of alignment, causing pain. TMJ pain can also be associated with a clicking sound when you chew or talk, or there may be a sensation of grinding.Some people with TMJ have other conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic headache, endometriosis, fibromyalgia, bladder inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome, low back pain, sleep disorders, and painful sexual intercourse in women. It is not clear that TMJ and these other disorders are necessarily connected.
TMJ occurs in both men and women, but women tend to have more severe pain and limitation of movement than men.
 The primary symptom of TMJ is pain in the joint and in the muscles of the jaw. Other symptoms include:Pain in the neck and in the shoulders
Chronic headaches
Stiffness in the jaw muscles
Limitations in jaw movement
Locking of the jaw
Pain or pressure in the ear
Ringing in the ears
Painful clicking, popping, or grating in the jaw joint when the mouth is opening or closing
A bite that feels off or is misaligned

, If you have any of these symptoms, it is recommended that you see a medical doctor as well as a pain specialist for treatment. Some dentists specialize in TMJ disorders as well.You should be certain that other potential causes of TMJ pain are excluded first. These causes include sinus or ear infections, dental problems including tooth abscesses, various forms of chronic headache, nerve-related facial pain, bone disease, and tumors.

 Don’t wear a ballerina bun with dirty or tangled hair—it doesn’t look very good.


Get rid of tangles by combing your hair gently when it is wet. Be aware that you will probably yank a lot of hair out if you try to brush wet hair.
Consider leaving your hair slightly wet to make your hair easier to manage.;
, Make sure your hair is smooth.









Make sure that there are no stray hairs in your face.
Look in the mirror to make sure that your hair is smooth and flat without any loose hairs sticking up.
 Use an elastic ponytail holder.









Make sure that the ponytail is tight so that you can finish it in a tight bun.
Wrap the elastic several times if you have thin hair.
Position the ponytail wherever you want the finished bun to be located.
 Make sure that no hairs are sticking out.









Grasp the ponytail in one hand and brush your hair with the other.
Redo the ponytail if it comes loose.
 Make sure that all of your hair is included in the twist.








Use both hands to do this properly.
Use hairspray to pat down any hairs that are too short for the twist.
 Begin wrapping your hair rope tightly around the base of the ponytail.








Keep twisting your hair as you wrap it around.
Make sure that the twist is tight against your head.
Tuck in any loose hairs.
 Make sure that the pins are helping to keep the bun tight against your head.









Start at the top and make your way around.
Place pins all the around the base of the bun.
Use more pins if your hair is very long or thick.
 Stop any hairs from coming loose.









Spray the bun and all around your head.
Don’t use too much hairspray.

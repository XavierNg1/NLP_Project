 To ensure that your grilled cheesy bread cooks properly, it’s important to preheat the grill. Set the temperature gauge to medium high heat. It usually takes 10 to 15 minutes for the grill to reach your desired heat, so plan ahead.Make sure to keep the grill’s lid closed while you’re preheating. That will allow it to reach the right temperature more quickly.
 Take a loaf of long, crusty bread, such as a French baguette, and cut it half lengthwise with a bread knife. Spread 4 tablespoons (57 g) of softened butter over the two pieces, and then sprinkle with 2 garlic cloves that have been minced.The best way to soften butter is to set it out at room temperature for about 30 minutes.
 Take the bottom piece of bread, and cover it with ½ cup (50 g) mozzarella cheese and ½ cup (50 g) fontina cheese. Drizzle 1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil over the cheese, and sprinkle with ¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) red pepper flakes.If you don’t like the heat that comes with red pepper flakes, you can omit them or replace them with another seasoning, such as parsley or green onion.
 Place the top piece of bread over the cheese-covered bottom as if forming a sandwich. Take a sheet of foil, and wrap the entire loaf of bread so all of the ingredients are contained inside., Place the foil wrapped bread on the heated grill, and allow it to cook until the cheese melts and the bread becomes toasted. That usually takes about 10 minutes.Be sure to check the bread often. It’s okay if it gets a little charred, but you want to avoid allowing it to actually burn.
 When the bread is finished grilling, allow it to sit in the foil for a minute. Next, unwrap the bread and allow it to cool for about 5 minutes or until you can handle it comfortably. Use a bread knife to slice the loaf crosswise for serving.

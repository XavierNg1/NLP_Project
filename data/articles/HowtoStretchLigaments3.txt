 Stand with your knees slightly bent and your feet shoulder-width apart. Face a chest-high stretch bar and grab it with both hands.


If no stretch bar is available, choose another stationary, steady object, like the handle of a closed door or the edge of a desk. Ideally, the object should also be between waist and chest height.
Cross your wrists while grabbing the bar. Your left hand should grab the bar from the right, and your right hand should grab the bar from the left. Using this type of grip should help steady the rest of your body.
 Gently ease your legs and buttocks back, pushing them as far as they will go without causing pain. Your upper body will gradually lean forward and toward the bar.


In this position, you'll be working on your lats (back), shoulders, and hips. You should feel the muscles in these areas stretch as you move into position.
Only push yourself to the end range of your back muscles. You should feel some muscle discomfort, but you should not feel any actual pain.
 Remain in this leaning position for a full 30 seconds before gradually rising up and forward.


During the first 15 to 20 seconds, only the muscles in the targeted areas will stretch. Afterward, the muscles will relax, allowing the connected ligaments to stretch.
Ease yourself back into a relaxed, upright position over several seconds. Jerky movements could potentially cause injury.

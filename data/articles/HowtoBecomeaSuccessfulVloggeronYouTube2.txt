 You don't have to buy the best equipment or cameras for your vlogs. Most you should focus on is getting a camera with good HD quality, and one that provides good sound quality for your viewers. These can be found at any store near you.
 They don't even have to be catchy. It can just be a title that can trigger a particular memory in your audience. The title can be fun. The title can be wild. The title can even be mischievous! Here are some examples of fun titles:


A Trip to Peru!
I Went Sky Diving!
You Won't Believe What I Found / Trip To Peru pt. 3

, Usually, the best time to vlog is around 8:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M. Those are the times when sunlight is most present.
 This is for if you are not vlogging around the house or in public.


You can even purchase a green screen. Later, when you've finished your video, you can edit a picture or background onto the green screen.

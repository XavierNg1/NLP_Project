 If your family is preparing to adopt a child, your children may confused as to the reasons why, particularly if the adoptee is a different race. If they haven't encountered blended families before, they may not understand that family members can have different colored skin. Simply explain that just because an adopted child has different colored skin than their parents, they are still related because of adoption.You might say, "Even though Sammy is a different color, she is just like any other member of our family. We will all treat her that way."

, The whole concept of a person raising a baby who did not grow from their own body is a difficult concept to grasp for some kids. However, if you explain that two people do not have to have the same blood lines to be related, they may become more understanding of the situation. Tell your child that the parents love the child just as much as they would if they had had the baby themselves.


If you are married, you can use this situation as an example of how people can be family if they aren’t technically related. Explain how you’ve created an emotional and legal bond with your spouse, and adoption is similar., Your child may not understand how a parent can love a child that they didn’t conceive themselves. However, it is important to reassure them that their friend or new sibling who was adoptive is loved just as much as they are. Additionally, go into how their parents are their “real” parents, even though they may have not actually given birth to them.


You might say, "Our family took in Sadie and we agreed to love her and take care of her as one of our own."Be sure to talk about why it is so special to take in someone as part of your family and how it means that you really love them.

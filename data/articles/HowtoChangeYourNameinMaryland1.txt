 Before you get married, you must apply for your license in the county where the ceremony will be taking place. If you don't have a license, your marriage won't be legally valid.


The clerk will issue your license when you file your application and pay the fee, but the license doesn't take effect until the second calendar day after it's issued.
Since fees vary among Maryland counties, you should contact the clerk in the county where you plan to be wed.
The application includes information such as full legal name, date and place of birth, place of residence, Social Security number and marital status of both parties to be wed.
Once you've filed your application, your license is valid for six months.;
, Whether you choose an elaborate ceremony or a simple civil court hearing, your wedding officiant will complete your license and distribute it according to instructions on the form., If youÂ choose to take your spouse's last name, or if you both want to use a hyphenated combination of both last names, you can start using it immediately after your ceremony.
 To get your name changed on government-issued documents such as your driver's license or your Social Security card, you must present a certified copy of your wedding certificate.


Fill out the Request for Copy of a Maryland Marriage Record and turn it in to your county's clerk of courts along with the required fee.
Present the certified copy at your local Social Security office to get your name changed on your Social Security card. After you've changed your name on your Social Security card, you can get your name changed on your Maryland driver's license and anywhere else.

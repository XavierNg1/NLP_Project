 If you do not have a case for storage, put them in a small pouch in your handbag or backpack so they can stay secured. Next time you use them, the cord will be wrapped rather than tangled.








Grab each of the ends. Starting from the earbuds, wrap your headphones around three of your fingers if you have larger hands, or four fingers if you have smaller hands. Stop wrapping when there is 3 inches (7.62 cm) left. Take out the wrapped part carefully, making sure that it doesn't come apart.Wrap the remaining length of cord around the middle of the headphones. There should be enough cord left to wrap it around the headphones at least twice.Tuck the end in. Once the entire cord has been wrapped around the headphones and you run out of cord to wrap, tuck the end of the cord into the part that’s already wrapped around. Check that it's secured tightly enough.;
, Take a small object, such as a pencil, a hairbrush, or a candle holder, and wrap the cord carefully around. This will hold the headphones in place so that they won’t tangle when not in use.








Tuck the end of the cord into the final loop while wrapping the cord around your object. This will secure the cord and will also allow for easy removal from the object.
 Find a small jar or a prescription bottle, and place your wrapped cord into the container. This way, the headphone cords will be unable to tangle since the small space will keep them in place.

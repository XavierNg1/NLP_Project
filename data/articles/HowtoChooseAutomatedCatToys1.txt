 Before you choose an automated toy, take some time to consider what types of toys your cat currently enjoys. For example, if your cat likes chasing a laser pointer, you might consider an automated laser toy. If your cat likes pouncing on a plush mouse, you might buy an automated mouse toy.

If your cat likes leaping, consider a hanging toy.
If your cat likes running, consider a toy that moves across the floor.;
, Make sure you choose a cat toy that is made of materials that are safe for cats. For example, you should not buy a toy that is made of small objects like beads, beans, or nutshells. A cat can easily choke on or consume these materials, quickly turning playtime into a visit to the vet., Before you buy a toy, inspect its integrity and construction. Cat toys should be free from loose parts, sharp edges, and metal. If you notice a component of the toy that could be potentially dangerous for your cat, do not purchase the toy.

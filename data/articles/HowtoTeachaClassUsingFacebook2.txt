 They should do this at the beginning of the class, in order to use the Facebook profile throughout the semester.
 Then, ask the students to become each other's friends. This is a good thing to do in a computer lab, while each student presents who they will be for the assignment.
 For example, by week 1 they must have a picture, by week 2 they must have biographical information and by week 3 they must make their first status update.
 They must write in from the perspective of the person they are representing, forcing them to think critically about how historical and personal events affected them.


Feature 5 excellent status updates from the class each week. This encourages students, gives them ideas on how to be creative on their profile and gives you a chance to bring new subjects into the classroom.
 If 1 student is Abraham Lincoln and the other is Stephen Douglas, they can use topics from the Lincoln/Douglas debates throughout the semester.
 Instead of having the student write down an answer on paper, they can respond in a colorful way, using links, photos and well thought out prose. Replace a quiz with this exercise.
 Set an assignment to post a comment or question on every other student's page, encouraging discussion. They can engage in a thread that is already being discussed by other students or start their own post.
 If you create a fun atmosphere around the assignment, next semester's students will be excited to start it.
 Ask the students to delete their profile so that future students will not be able to copy aspects of the assignment.

, Arrange for who will go first, and how long each of the intervals will be.
 The people after the leader should be straight behind him, and about 1–2 feet (0.3–0.6 m) back so that if the leader makes any sudden turns or stops, the people behind him will have time to react. Another, more efficient position (i.e. it maximizes the effect of drafting), is to offset your front wheel from the leader's rear wheel by a few inches, but trail within 1 foot (0.3 m). For example, if there is a headwind, position your front wheel so that it slightly to the side of the leader's rear wheel, not directly behind it. In fact, the wheels may even 'overlap' by several inches (when observed from the side). The photo above shows this very technique - the second person is less than a foot behind the puller, but offset by several inches.
 The puller (i.e. the person in front), will indicate that he/she will fall off, and then give one or two strong kicks to clear the pack (in case any followers overlap his/her rear wheel). Then s/he will veer sharply to the left or right, and then slow down or coast to the back of the pace line. The new puller should then resume at the same pace as before, or pick it up slightly.

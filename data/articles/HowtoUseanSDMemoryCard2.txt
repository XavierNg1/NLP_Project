 If your computer doesn't have a card reader, you can purchase an external adapter that connects via USB.


MicroSD cards will likely need to be inserted into an SD card adapter to fit into most conventional SD card slots.
If you are using Windows XP or Vista, SDXC (Secure Digital Extended Capacity) cards inserted into your computer will likely not be read, prompting you to format.

 You can move files around just like you would in any other folder. Copying content to and from your computer will take longer than moving files between folders on your computer.
 Some SD cards have physical locks on them that prevent the data from being modified. You can find the lock on the left edge of the SD card when you're looking at it from the front.


If the lock is broken, click here for instructions on fixing the card.
 If Windows cannot read your SD card, it may need to be formatted. Formatting will erase all of the data on the card, so make sure that there is nothing you want to keep on it before you format it.


Open Computer/My Computer/This PC.
Right-click on your SD card and select "Format"
Select "FAT32" as the file system. This will allow the SD card to be accessed by the widest range of devices.
Check the "Quick format" box and click Start.
 Formatting your SD card using the Windows Format tool can occasionally lead to poor performance or less available space. The SD Association offers a free tool that you can download from their website (sdcard.org/downloads).


This tool is necessary if you are formatting an SDXC card.

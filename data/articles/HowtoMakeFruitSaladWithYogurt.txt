 Depending on the fruit of the season, wash it first, then peel, seed, core and cut it into small bite-sized pieces. Save any juice that comes to add to the salad.;
, Place the cut fruit in a deep bowl, and if possible, sprinkle on a tablespoon of lemon juice to preserve the color of cut fruit.
 You could add shredded coconut, raisins, craisins, chopped raw or toasted nuts, or dried fruit bits.
 Use plain whole or low-fat yogurt, adding enough to lightly coat each piece of fruit, without having a lot of yogurt sitting on the bottom of the bowl. Toss lightly with a large spoon. You could also mix the yogurt with mayonnaise or sour cream to vary the taste. You could also use flavored yogurt such as vanilla or strawberry to add a sweeter, more fruity flavor.

Additionally, you want your refrigerator to be clean and avoid keeping expired or too much leftover food.
 The first advice you’ll hear from cooks on how to become better cooks is to have good knives. Invest in the nicest knives you can afford.

A knife that is sharp enough won’t cause you to cry.

Thursday is meat and potato night.
Friday is burger night.
Saturday is your night to go out.
Sunday is leftover night.

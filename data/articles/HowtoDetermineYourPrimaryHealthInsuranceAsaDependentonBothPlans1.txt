 The "birthday rule" is used to determine which health insurance plan is primary if you are a dependent on both plans, but it only applies to children.If you are a minor, you can use the birthday rule to determine your primary health insurance plan.
The rule also may apply if you are over the age of 18, but you're a college student and still considered a dependent of your parents.;
, As its name suggests, the birthday rule compares the birthday of each of your parents to determine your primary health insurance. The primary plan is the one for the insured parent that has the first birthday each year.For example, suppose you are listed as a dependent on both your mother's health insurance and your father's health insurance. Your mother's birthday is April 21, while your father's birthday is December 1.
Under the birthday rule, your mother's health insurance would be your primary plan using that example.
If your parents both have the same birthday, your primary health insurance plan is the one with the earliest effective date.
For example, if both your parents were born on July 11, but your mother's plan has an effective date two years before your father's plan, your mother's plan is your primary plan.
 If your parents are divorced or legally separated, your primary plan may not be the one associated with the parent with the earliest birthday.Generally, the policy of the parent who a court has ruled is responsible for your health insurance is your primary plan.
If there's no court ruling regarding health insurance, your primary plan is the policy of whichever parent has primary custody of you.
If primary custody hasn't been determined, then the birthday rule applies.

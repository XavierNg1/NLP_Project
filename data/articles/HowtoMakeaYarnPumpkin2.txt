 Hold your hand out flat with your fingers together. Wrap the yarn around your fingers about 120 times.Be sure to wrap loosely so has not to cut off blood circulation.


Choose plain, medium or worsted-weight yarn for this.
 Start by cutting a piece of your orange yarn that is around 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) long.Thread it below the yarn bundle, between your middle and ring finger.
 Try to keep the short piece of yarn in position.
 Bring the two ends of the short piece of yarn together, and tie them into a tight knot. Flip the bundle over, and wrap the yarn to the back. Tie the yarn into a tight, double knot.


Even though this is just like making a pompom, do not cut the yarn bundle apart.
 Cut a green or brown pipe cleaner down to 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) and place it on top of your knotted yarn. Tie the ends of the yarn over the pipe cleaner in another double knot., Fold the pipe cleaner in half, then twist the ends together to make a thick stem. If you'd like, you can curl the end of the stem over your finger, pen, or pencil.


To great vines: wrap a green pipe cleaner around a skewer or pencil, pull it off, then gently pull it apart to create a spring. Wrap it around the base of the stem., Once again, do not cut the loops of yarn apart. Instead, manipulate them with your fingers so that they are evenly spread around the stem, creating a squashed, pumpkin-like shape. At this point, you can cut the loose ends of the short piece of yarn off. Alternatively, you can tie them to a long piece of twine to make a garland.

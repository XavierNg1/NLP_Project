 Foods that contain fibers, healthy fats, and proteins are especially good for making you feel full. Get fiber from vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. Eat avocados, nuts, nut butters, and olive oil to add healthy fats to your meal. Choose lean proteins like chicken and fish.For an example of a balanced dinner, try some grilled chicken marinated in olive oil, rosemary, a pinch of sea salt, and ground pepper. Slice up some avocado to go on top. Have some quinoa or brown rice, and finish it off with about a cup (236.89 mL) of steamed lima beans (a great source of fiber).
 Maybe you’re going to a baseball game, carnival, or wedding. This is the time to plan to have some popcorn, cotton candy, or cake. Eat these unhealthy (but delicious) foods mindfully as well, and notice how much more you enjoy them!, Social situations can be especially hard to handle when you’re trying to lose weight. Look up the menu and pick a meal before you arrive. Eat slowly at the restaurant, and box it up when you feel full.If you can’t find anything healthy on the menu, eat a small meal before you go out. You can then just get an appetizer, or only eat half of an entrée.Don’t feel weird about eating slowly in front of your friends, family members, or a date. If they ask about it, tell them about mindful eating. It’s a perfect time to talk about something that’s making you feel healthier with people that are close to you!

, Traveling when you’re working on weight loss is also tough. Bring along small, balanced snacks when you’re getting from place to place. If you can, book hotels with small kitchens to make your own meals. Search online before you depart to find healthy eating-out and grocery store options.For healthy snacks, go with a piece of fruit or an almond butter sandwich on whole-grain bread.

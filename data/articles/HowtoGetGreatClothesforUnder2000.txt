 Sometimes thrift stores and second-hand stores sell great clothes for very little. You might be able to find brand-name clothes in great condition that someone has donated simply because it doesn't fit them anymore. If you're comfortable with wearing second-hand clothes, thrift stores offer great deals.;
, Stores such as Target, Walmart, or Kohls have stylish clothes for better prices than brand-name stores. Most of the clothing at these stores is still in style, as they tend to try to carry clothes that are "in" right now, but for less money.
 If you still want brand-name clothes for a steal, outlet malls are the way to go. They have great stores (such as Hollister or Abercrombie) for a lot less money than stores in shopping malls.
 The next time you're at the mall, try shopping at some new stores that are more reasonably-priced than others. You might find a store that you really like with really cheap clothes., If you're shopping at stores in the mall, try to hunt down deals, especially when shopping with your friends. If there's a promotion going on for 4 shirts for $20, ask each of your friends to buy a shirt so that you'll all save money.
 Always look through the sale racks at stores; sometimes you'll be able to find clothes that you love that are on sale. Also, try to find a clearance rack at every store - they sell nice clothes for rock-bottom prices, especially as the seasons change.
 Go online before going shopping and search your favourite stores. See if they have any sales going on on their websites. Find clothes that you like on-line that are on sale, and then find them at the store once you get there.
 If your friend tells you about a great deal they got at a store, go to that store! Once your friends come back from a shopping trip, ask them if there were any good sales.
 By doing this, you'll save more money on clothes in the long run, as you can use versatile clothing more often by layering it, putting a cardigan over it, etc.

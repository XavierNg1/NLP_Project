 They usually create negative energy. Also make sure you don't have things that shine, light bulbs in strong colours etc.;
, Don't meditate in a room that has open windows to a street that has intense traffic. If you meditate outside, choose a relaxing place. No cars or noisy animals!

, I advise you to do this on a radio, playing music on a computer or listening to it with earphones is not good enough. Choose a peaceful, calming music.
 Nice smells help you relax.
 Don't sit on a hard surface. On the other hand, a way to comfortable bed in which you are "sinking" is not good either.

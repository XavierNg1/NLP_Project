 Gogo wears her hair medium-long, pin-straight and dark brown with bangs down to above her eye-brows...if you don't already have this style, go to the mall or online to find a cheap wig.;
, Or lack-thereof. She doesn't really wear any, but she does have a nice complexion (the actress is a model in Japan after all) and nice eye-lashes, so you might want to put on some light cover-up and mascara.
, It's going under the blazer, so it's not too important.
 This could be on the expensive side if you decide to buy it, so check closets, thrift stores, and relatively cheap stores like Rue 21 or Walmart before you look anywhere else. The one she wears has just two buttons in the front, but it's not that serious unless you're a perfectionist.
 You have a few options here. You can

a) Ignore it...really, who's going to notice a patch?
Pay to have it made or
Make it yourself. You could just print it out in colour and tape it on, or do this. Take the time to paint it on canvas, then cut it out and use clear thread to sew it on. It's all up to you, and how serious you take your role-playing.
 This, believe it or not, can be the cheapest part of your outfit...one is found for only two dollars! This is why it's recommend finding the costume yourself, not buying it completed off of the internet--if you know how to shop, then it's MUCH cheaper this way. The skirt she wears in the movie is shades of navy; however, black should do just fine as well.
 In the movie, they're Nike, but if you don't feel like being a sell-out, there's always Payless. Try Claire's or Hot Topic for the socks--you should be able to find them there.
 After spending hours (and that means HOURS) creating her meteor hammer (the chain with the spike-y ball attached), it's recommended to buy this rather than making it. However, if you are extremely craft-y, go for it. She also has a blade (Tanto) that would be easier to create/find/purchase, but it's not as fun as swinging the meteor hammer around!

 Belle's style is very simplistic and sensible, but it's still flattering. Take Belle's simple white and blue dress, for example - it's very simple, but it's still flattering. To adapt that style into the modern-day world, think about buying a solid-colour dress and adding a belt at the waist, then pairing it with a solid-colour cardigan.;
, Belle's style is very versatile and effortless - she's able to pair up simple things and pull them off. To mimic this, wear blouses, cardigans, and skirts which are classic and timeless. Instead of buying clothes that are very trendy, go instead for items that are always in style and that you know you'll be able to wear a lot.
 Remember that there's a difference between co-ordinating and matching the colours; you don't want to literally match every part of your outfit, stick to just a few solid colors that compliment your eye, hair, and skin color and that go well together.
 This style should be put together and sophisticated. This means that short-shorts and tanks should be worn only at the beach or for a jog, and opt instead for classier, more put-together outfits when out with friends, at a restaurant, etc.
 Items that suggest a gothic, vintage style are perfect, like intricate embroidery, brooches, or old-fashioned buttons.
 Wear a bright-colored dress that fits in at the waist and has some nice detailing on it, such as ruffles, ribbon, or a bit of beading. Although you don't have to go all-out with a ballgown, you can incorporate touches of her beautiful gown into a modern-day sundress or another shorter dress.

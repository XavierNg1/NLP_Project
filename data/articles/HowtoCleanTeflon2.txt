 If you have an oily layer and some food particles cooked onto the Teflon surface, wait for the pan to cool, and fill up the pan about half way with water. Then, add about ½ cup of vinegar to the pan.
 Place the pan on a stove burner, and bring the water and vinegar to a boil. This may take somewhere between 5-10 minutes depending on how high you put the flame.


As the water and vinegar gets hotter and starts to boil, the oil and food particles will begin to rise to the surface of the water in the pan., Once the oil has risen to the surface, turn off the flame, and use a bunched up paper towel to dab at the pools of oil.The water will be very hot, so be very careful not to touch the water as you collect the oil. Once you have collected most of the oil on the paper towel, dispose the paper towel. If there are any floating food particles, use a perforated plastic spoon to collect the food, and throw it in the garbage.


It’s recommended to use a perforated plastic spoon so you can collect the food particles while letting the hot water drain from the spoon.
When all the food debris is removed, carefully pour the rest of the water down the drain.
 Let the pan sit in the sink and cool down before you start washing it. To cool the pan down quickly, you can try running cool to lukewarm water on the pan about a couple of minutes. Use a soft nylon scrubber, sponge, washcloth, or paper towel with a few drops of dishwashing soap to gently clean the pan in your kitchen sink. Gently rub the pan surface to remove any food particles that may still be stuck to the pan.


Thoroughly rinse the pan with clean water to remove any remaining soap.
 Use a drying rack, or some sort of towel to wipe down and dry the pan completely. The pan will be ready for another use, or to be stored for later use.

 This air freshener contains vinegar, so it also doubles up as a disinfectant. Here's a list of what you will need to make one:


1 teaspoon baking soda (bicarbonate of soda)
½ cup (120 milliliters) warm water
1 tablespoon white vinegar
2 – 3 drops essential oil

, Try to use a spray bottle made out of glass, as essential oils may eat away at certain types of plastic.
 Be sure to close the bottle first.
 Avoid using red whine or apple cider vinegar, or you may risk staining fabric and furniture.
 You can use more essential oil if you want a stronger scent. Keep in mind that the vinegar smell will go away once the spray dries.
 Vinegar may not smell pretty at first, but it helps deodorize other things. The smell also goes away once it dries.
 You can use it on anything that smells funky in your room. The baking soda will help deodorize it, while the vinegar will help kill and odor-causing bacteria. Once the spray dries, the lovely scent of the essential oil you used will be left behind.

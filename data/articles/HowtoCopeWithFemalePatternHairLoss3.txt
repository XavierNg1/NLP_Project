 The key is to feel bad for awhile but then to do something proactive about your problem.
 One way to think positively is to try to keep your hair loss in perspective. You are the same person that you've always been. What's inside of your head is much more important than what's on top of it! While it won't be easy to remember this all the time, try to keep it in mind when you are having an especially hard moment dealing with your hair loss.
 You can turn to your family or loved ones. They are the people who love you for who you are, not for how thick your hair is. You can also turn to other women who are experiencing hair loss. For instance, there are a variety of support groups for women who are experiencing the loss of their hair, some of which are online.

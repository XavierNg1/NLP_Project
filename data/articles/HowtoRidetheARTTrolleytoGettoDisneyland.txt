 Make sure that you obtain the route number. There are over 20 different ART buses that make a stop at Disneyland and it can often be confusing.(Write down this number in a safe location to be used for your return trip).;
, While most make direct stops at Disneyland, some don't unless you want to switch routes.
 While some hotels charge the room reservation, some aren't allowed to and you must buy the ticket to ride the bus and some are included in the reservation but few people decide to ask.
, There's no need to wave/flag the bus driver down. When they see people at the stop on their route, they will know to pick you up. The door will open.
 There will be a small step from the ground, but can be adjusted by the driver's permission.
 Let it scan the barcode. Make sure to follow the directions that the ticket tells you to use. Sometimes you stick it in face-up, sometimes face down, but always in the direction the arrow tells you to insert it.
 This ticket will be your ride back to your resort at the end of the day and the transfer ticket between the two bus lines.
 While most seats on some buses feel like park-bench type seats, they are not all bench-like.
 You'll be at their East gate and will have saved many dollars. (When the amount you've saved by not taking your car to the parking lots at Disneyland and/or other family members adds up, you'll eventually come to realize you've made the right decision and got their safely.
 Debunk from the bus the opposite way you came in. Walk straight up to the area straight ahead of your bus. If you see a road, you'll need to walk the opposite direction, but it will be straight in front of your nose.

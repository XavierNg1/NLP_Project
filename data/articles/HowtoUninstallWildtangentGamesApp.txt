Method 1 (Employ Windows' default uninstall feature): Open Start menu >> go to Control Panel >> "Add/Remove Programs" or "Programs & Features" >> locate the unwanted WildTangent Games then launch "Uninstall/Change" option or you can press Enter key if you're running a Windows 8/7/Vista operating system.
Method 2: Go to WildTangent's installation file folder, which should be saved in "Program Files (x86)" by default >> run the above "uninstall" application via your Admin rights.
, Delete the remaining "Games", "Touchpoints" folder and other traces if you do not want to reuse WildTangent.

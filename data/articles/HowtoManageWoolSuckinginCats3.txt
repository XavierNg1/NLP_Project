 When you notice your cat sucking wool, think about your cat's diet and energy levels. If your cat isn't eating a nutritious, high-quality diet, then a nutritional deficiency could be causing the sucking. But if your cat eats a good diet, has plenty of energy, and has a nice coat, the wool sucking probably isn't caused by a health issue.If you suspect an underlying health problem, the vet can do a complete physical and run blood work. This may find an untreated chronic health problem that's causing the wool sucking.
 Your cat's genes may play a role in causing the wool sucking. Oriental breeds are more likely to develop the behavior. Your cat may also be more likely to suck wool if it was weaned at an early age (around 6 or 7 weeks). Your cat may be sucking wool as a way of comforting itself.Most young cats that start wool sucking begin doing it around 2 to 4 months old or once it's weaned.
 Look to see if your cat begins to suck or eat other items that aren't food. This can mean that your cat has developed an eating disorder known as pica. Talk with the vet about treating it before it causes intestinal blockages in your cat. Talk with the vet if you notice your cat sucking or eating:Cloth and paper
Hair
Plastic (like electric cords) and acrylic cloths (like nylon)
Shoelaces
Wood

, If your cat isn't responding to redirection or you suspect the wool sucking is caused by another health issue, you may need to talk with the veterinarian about treating your cat with medication. The vet can give your cat medication for the wool sucking compulsion, but it may take weeks or months before you notice an improvement.The vet will need to monitor your cat for side effects and may need to adjust the dosages over time.

 Purchase fresh when it fits your budget and timing. Fresh fruits and vegetables can be more expensive, but are worth the money in nutrition and flavor. Usually they can be eaten raw or cooked. Sometimes there is not a substitute for fresh. Fresh fruits and vegetables should be consumed in the week you purchase them to avoid rot or lessening nutritional value. Antioxidant content begins to degrade immediately after harvest as do some vitamins, so the closer to harvest you eat them the more nutrition you will obtain.;
, Frozen vegetables are frozen quickly after harvest and maintain many nutrients. They are easy to cook and can be stored for long periods of time. They are also very affordable and readily available. Frozen fruit is also a good option. It can be defrosted overnight and eaten without cooking, but the texture will have changed because of the freezing process. It is best to use frozen fruit for desserts or to cook with.
 Canned vegetables are great for making soups and casseroles. They are also convenient. Canned vegetables may have lost some nutrients during the high heat cooking process, but they still contain a fair amount. Having canned fruits and vegetables on hand helps with having a fruit or vegetable at every meal. When purchasing canned fruit be sure to read the label. Many canned fruits are packed in syrup, which adds extra sugar and calories. Try purchasing canned fruit in juice or water instead. Canned fruit is great for all ages because it is typically softer and comes pre-portioned.
 Juice has nutrients, but lacks the fiber. It is good for getting a fruit in when you donâ€™t have time or you are not somewhere fruit is readily available. The high sugar and calorie content of juice makes it a tricky choice. The best way to consume is in moderation. Also, remember to only purchase 100% fruit juice.

,, Down at the bottom there will be a section titled Virtual Memory. Select Change.


There will be two spaces where you can change the amount of virtual memory you want to use. It is listed in megabytes (MB) so you want to take how many gigabytes (GB) that you are interested in using and multiply that number by 1024. This will give you the amount in MB.
 After that, just click ok and apply and there you go. You just changed your virtual memory and helped give your PC an option to rely on should you run out of RAM.

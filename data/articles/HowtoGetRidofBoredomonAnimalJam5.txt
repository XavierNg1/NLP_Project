 Up on the surface people bully and scam, down in the waves is all peaceful, nice, glitchy, fun, and friendly, so you know where to be––under the sea.
 For some reason, it makes Best Dressed more fun. Well, have fun with your probably neglected sea animal by playing this really fun game. And here's a tip, always wear the gingerbread man.
 It's more peaceful (most of the time). Since Jammers usually don't go underwater, it will be more peaceful and more calm, with no screaming traders or desperate singles. But, sadly, it is not always that peaceful. At times there can be big underwater parties with, yes, people screaming for you to join their adventure. But don't worry, it's usually peaceful.
 Some best friends were met underwater. So, just another good reason to go down there. You know what, stop reading. Go down there right now.

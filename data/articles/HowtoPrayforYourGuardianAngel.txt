 Be relaxed, sit in a comfortable chair and pray at a time when you will not be disturbed. Focus on communicating with your guardian angel.;
, Breathe from your belly if you are able to - this way you can focus on the breathing and relaxation will come easier. Focus on the prayer you want to make. If there are any thoughts that are popping up in you head, let them go and focus back on the prayer.
 Visualize that there is a white light surrounding you - with you. It banishes all negative thoughts and behaviors. Breathe in the light in until you feel that you are completely at peace with yourself.
 Relax and meditate for a couple of minutes. If you have any thoughts, let them go and continue with the meditation. When you feel like you're ready, say: Guardian angel, come to me. Exhale slowly and say to yourself: With love and joy, so let it be.
 Pause and repeat this breathing exercise for as long as you like, then let it fade away. Continue breathing and set yourself open to your guardian angel. No matter what you see or feel, stay relaxed and centered.
 Thank the divine for this gift and experience.
 When you are done, again see yourself surrounded by white light and see it disperse or fade into Mother Earth. Slowly come back to the physical world.

 Vacuuming is a good first step for clearing your floors. Since parquet floors are patterned by different sizes of wood, vacuuming can reach the dirt between the cracks. The vacuum also loosens the dirt to be scrubbed more thoroughly later., You can use a normal brush, but you can also use a dust specific dry mop. Certain dry mops even have special tissues especially for wood floors or parquet floors. Sweeping is important to get all the bits of dirt that the vacuum missed.
 Clean the parquet floor with a damp mop if your parquet floor is sealed. The trick is to use as little water as possible on the floor. Start in one corner of the room and mop in an eight symbol to remove excessive dirt and sand. Wring the mop thoroughly out, and mop the floor again to remove the excessive water until the floor is dry.
 It is best to do the aforementioned steps once every two weeks, if not more frequently. By doing these steps on a regular basis, you wonâ€™t be required to do a deep cleaning as often. You also will prevent the buildup of crude between the panels of wood.

 Responding to emails like this - or any type of spam - merely confirms your email account as an active one and can result in you getting a whole lot more spam. Forwarding an email like this to an anti-phishing website, like the ones listed below, can help stop or slow its progress.
 If you are concerned that there may be an actual problem with your account, navigate to the website yourself and log in.


Do not copy and paste text or links from the email to your web browser. What you might be able to do if the link is live and you're in an online email program, is hover your mouse over the link, without clicking and check the browser for confirmation of where that link will take you; if it's not legitimate, you'll soon see an odd address. This is simply more confirmation of your suspicions.
Banks do not send emails asking for you to input personal information from an email link. They're wise to the scams, so don't fall for any such emails. Visit or call the bank if you're worried and get reassurance from a teller or customer service officer (and use the Yellow Pages telephone number, not any number provided in an email).
 It is better to be slow in responding than to be fast in replying and lose it all. When your suspicions are raised, take time away from the email to talk to a trusted person, check online websites for information about scams or even call the police for information.

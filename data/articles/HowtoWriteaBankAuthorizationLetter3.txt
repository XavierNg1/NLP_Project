 If all you want to do is allow someone to deposit money in your account, some banks allow people to do this without special authorization. Depending on what bank you use, you may not need to write an official letter or fill out any forms. Contact your bank for more information on its policies regarding third party deposits.
 Giving someone your bank card or account information is a way to self-authorize them to make a withdrawal. However, banks advise against doing this, since you won't have control over how much the person withdraws from your account. Some banks have explicit policies in place to prevent non-account holders from making transactions, so using FPOA or listing the person as a co-signer may be a better bet.

 Ivermectin works by causing muscle paralysis in the worms. When it reaches the worms, it activates the worm’s chloride channels, which leads to paralysis. It also stops the worm’s nerve signaling by disrupting the worm’s calcium channels.When paralysis and nerve disruption sets in, the worms die within two days.
 In addition to combatting the worms listed in the previous section, this medication can also be used as an alternative to other first-line drugs to kill off other kinds of worms.

Trichuris Trichiura: This worm is more commonly known as Whipworm, due to its shape. It is generally found in areas where sanitation is poor.
Filariasis: This worm is transmitted by a mosquito and is generally found in tropical and subtropical areas. Cats and monkeys are common carriers of this group of worms.

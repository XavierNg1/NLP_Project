 Mastitis is a bacterial infection. One of the main ways dogs come in contact with the bacteria is from unclean living areas. To help prevent the bacteria from infecting your dog, change the bedding where the dog and puppies lay often. Make sure to clean the area as well.Many cases of mastitis start from the opening of the teat, so helping keep the environment clean can help prevent this.
 Since bacteria gets into the mammary glands to cause mastitis, you should clean the dog’s mammary gland are regularly. Use a warm compress to clean around the area every day.You should make sure to clean any wounds around the mammary glands that may be caused by a puppy’s claws.
Clean the underside of your dog after they go outside. Remove dirt and debris from around the teats. You should also clean them to make sure no urine has accidentally splashed onto the mammary glands.
 Another way to help prevent infection is to keep the dogs groomed. This includes the mother and the puppies. Start by shaving the hair around the mammary glands on the mother. This is important for longhaired dogs, since the hair can pick up bacteria and infect the glands.Keep the nails on the puppies trimmed. This helps reduce the risk of the puppies scratching the mother.

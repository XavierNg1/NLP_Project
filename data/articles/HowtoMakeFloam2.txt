 You will need two crayons, vegetable oil, water, flour, polystyrene beads, a knife, a pan, and a stovetop or hot plate. This method should be done by adults only.


The crayons should be from the same color family. For example, maroon and scarlet can be used together since they are both types of red., If the crayons are wrapped in paper, remove and discard it first. Using a sharp knife, slice up each of the two crayons into small pieces. The thinner the sections, the faster and easier they'll be to melt./images/thumb/6/64/Make-Floam-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Floam-Step-9-Version-2.jpg

, Set your stovetop to medium heat and place your pan on the burner. Measure out two tablespoons of vegetable oil and add it to your pan. Make sure that the oil doesn't get too hot.If your oil starts to pop or burn, turn the heat down.

, Add the chopped crayons into the hot pan. Gently stir the crayons and oil to mix. Once the crayons have completely melted into a liquid, move on to the next step. It's normal for some crayons to be clumpy or goopy at this stage. Others will be smooth and creamy./images/thumb/e/ea/Make-Floam-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Floam-Step-11-Version-2.jpg

, Slowly stir two cups of water into the melted crayon mixture. While continuing to stir, add two and a half cups of flour. Add the flour is smaller portions to make blending easier. Stir your mixture until it is well-blended and takes on a uniform consistency.

At this stage your dough should be relatively solid and pull together. If it is still sticky, add another half cup of flour before moving on., Turn off your stove and transfer the dough onto a clean cutting board. Wait a few minutes for the dough to cool down enough for you to comfortably touch it./images/thumb/4/4a/Make-Floam-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Floam-Step-13-Version-2.jpg

, Once the dough has cooled, use your hands to knead the dough for a minute or two. Next, add in some polystyrene beads and keep kneading./images/thumb/3/3c/Make-Floam-Step-14-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Floam-Step-14-Version-2.jpg

The exact amount of beads you'll need will vary. You'll want to add enough so that your floam is relatively thick and holds its shape well, but not so much that it crumbles apart. Add a half cup of polystyrene beads at a time until your floam reaches the right consistency.
 Since your floam is made from flour and oil, it can grow mold and go bad just as quickly as bread can. Refrigerate your floam when not in use to extend its lifespan. It's also a good idea to keep your floam in an airtight container or zipper bag to prevent it from drying out.

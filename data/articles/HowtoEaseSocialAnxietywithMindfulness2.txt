 One of the things to pay attention to with a mindfulness approach is your breath. Often, social anxiety causes irregularities with breathing. When you are in a social situation and you feel anxiety, take a moment to breathe. Pay attention to the way your breath goes in and out of your nostrils.This is a mindful action because you need to pull your thoughts away from whatever you are worried about and instead focus on your breathing.
 After you have focused your attention on your breaths and how the air is entering and exiting your lungs, you can breathe with intention. Take a slow inhale as you count to four. Hold for a count of four, then release as you count to four.You can do this discreetly as you talk to others or participate in a group gathering. You can subtly inhale and exhale, and count to yourself.
Repeat this three times. If you need to continue, keep breathing until you feel more in control.
You may also count to ten as you breathe. Count each breath as one count. If you start to focus on something other than your breath, start over at one. This is okay and normal.
Other types of breathing you might try include belly breathing and alternate nostril breathing.
 When you are focusing on your breath, your mind may wander. You may start thinking about your anxiety or something else. Part of the mindfulness technique is keeping your mind and thoughts on your breath instead of your anxiety. Whenever you start to drift, intentionally focus on your breath again.For example, if you are counting breaths, you may start thinking about something else. This is common. Just redirect your thoughts to your breath again. This intentional process of controlling your thoughts helps to decrease anxiety.
If you need to do this in private, you can step away from the group or excuse yourself to the bathroom.
Keep in mind that it is normal and okay for your mind to wander. When this happens, just return your attention back to the present moment and focus on your breathing.

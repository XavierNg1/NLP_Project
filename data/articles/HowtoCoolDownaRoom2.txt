 Ceiling fans are very effective because they move the air around the room and create a draft.They also pull air up when circulating it, and since hot air rises, this will help to cool the room down faster.If the ceiling fan isn’t already on in the room, turn it on immediately. If your ceiling fan has settings of low, medium and high, put the fan on the highest setting.


Check the ceiling fan blades to see if they’re rotating counterclockwise (if viewing them from below) – if they aren’t, adjust the settings.
Setting the blades to rotate counterclockwise and turning the fan on a higher speed will substantially increase air flow., Table fans, box fans, oscillating fans and mounted fans will all help to contribute to air circulation in the room and create a wind chill effect.A medium-sized oscillating fan placed on a desktop is very efficient at moving around stagnant hot air quickly. Keep multiple fans set up in the room during the summer so you can turn them on as soon as you walk in.Turn on your bathroom ventilation fan, too. The ventilation fan can help suck hot air out of the room, just as it does when you take a steamy shower., Create a makeshift air conditioner by filling up a shallow pan, tray or mixing bowl with ice and positioning it in front one of the fans. This will get cold, slightly misty air circulating the room very quickly.You could also use icepacks or, if you’re all out of ice, you can effectively improvise with something similarly cold, like a bag of frozen vegetables.


Position the bowl at a slight angle, tilted up, if the fan doesn’t seem to be blowing across the ice effectively., The fan will pull hot air out of the room and transfer it outside. It will also bring in cooler air. Put the fan in the window that gets the most shade – this will provide the coolest intake air. Close any other windows nearby tightly. Open a few windows on the other side of your house. This will create a house-wide draft and cool things down quickly.

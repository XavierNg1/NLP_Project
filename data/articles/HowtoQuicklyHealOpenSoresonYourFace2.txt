An uncomplicated infection on your face can sometimes turn into facial cellulitis.

Watch for redness, pain and swelling, and yellow or green pus. , Some people heal more slowly or are at risk of complications from infections, including those who are obese, diabetic, have poor blood flow due to arteriosclerosis, smoke, use alcohol heavily, or are under stress.See a doctor about your facial wound if you fall into one of these categories. She can advise you on the best plan of treatment.
 Only minor wounds should be treated at home. See a doctor if you have deep wounds with rough or uneven edges, if you can’t bring the edges together, or if you can’t properly clean the wound. You may need stitches to pull the skin back together, or you may be at risk for infection.If the wound won’t stop bleeding, you should also go to the doctor because this indicates it is a more serious wound.
See a doctor, too, if the area around the wound becomes very swollen, red, and tender to the touch. You may need an oral antibiotic.
 If the open wound on your face is caused by a cold sore, your doctor can prescribe antivirals to help heal the cold sore. These drugs may be in a pill or cream form. Pills generally heal cold sores faster than creams.If you don’t want to go see a doctor, you can buy over-the-counter creams that will heal the cold sore.

 Salt from your skin will corrode your razor blade, causing it to dull faster. Don't stop at simply rinsing the blade, give it a good scrubbing. Using an old toothbrush, simply scrub across the blade a few times to clean away any leftover skin and hair, before rinsing it in water again.;
, The quickest way to wear a razor blade is to let it rust. When water causes the metal blade to oxidize, tiny particles of rust form on it. You may not be able to see them, but those particles corrode the blade, dulling it.


Pat the razor dry on a towel to remove loose water droplets. Be sure you don't wipe it with the towel, because the blade will likely catch on the threads, dulling the blade.Dip the razor into a dish of rubbing alcohol. The alcohol will cause any remaining water to evaporate when it hits the air. As an added bonus, it also sanitizes the blade., You will defeat the purpose of drying your razor if you then stick it back in the humid shower or next to the sink where it will be splashed with water. Store the razor in a dry location away from either possibility or keep it in a resealable plastic bag. You can even set it in a cup with leftover beads of silicon gel - the kind that come in those little square packages - in the bottom or store it in your freezer between uses.

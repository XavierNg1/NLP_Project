 The relationship with your horse should have an equal amount of love, leadership, and language.Of these three, too much love and too little leadership from you can create a very spoiled horse.If your horse does not see you as his leader, he likely will not respect you. He is also unlikely to be responsible, since you did not set boundaries for him as his leader.Practice exercises that establish your leadership.
Ensure that his needs are taken care of, but do not overindulge him by feeding him a lot of treats or not disciplining him. His diet and training must have boundaries.
 If you notice that your horse’s ears are back, or if he is being pushy and forceful with you at feeding time, come back to feed him at a later time.If you feed him when he is acting aggressively, you will communicate to him that he is the boss. This will shift the balance of leadership from you to him.


Eventually, he will learn that he cannot act any way that he wants at feeding time.
 This may sound intuitive, but horses and dogs have a fundamentally different view of the world. Horses are prey animals and are motivated by safety and comfort. Dogs are predators and are motivated by attention and food.When you interact with a horse as if he were a dog—showering him with hugs and attention, for example—you are showing him way too much love and throwing off that part of your relationship with him.With all of this love and attention, your horse will think that you’ve given him free rein to push you around and assert his dominance.You will have much more trouble establishing your leadership if you interact with your horse as if he were a dog.

 Confidence comes from having a well developed sense of self and a grounded stability. In specific terms this means, not bragging about your successes and being unwavering in your commitment to overcome personal fears and obstacles:


Accept yourself. You do not owe explanations for who you are and how you behave in the world. People won't acknowledge you if you haven't already learn to accept yourself. This means that you've faced your dark emotions and thoughts and have processed them, reached your own conclusions and have a purpose and ambitious path in life. By ambitious, this means different things for different people. Woman admire guys who know where they are going and actively work each day to move closer to what they want.
Confidence and Arrogance are two different things. Confidence is inner strength and arrogance is an outer show display and an unhealthy obsession with an individual's persona. The arrogant man spends all his energy persuading others that he's always right and can do no wrong. The confident man doesn't involve himself in such behavior. He knows he's not perfect and doesn't even consider the idea of perfectionism.;
, You have to want to keep yourself clean and your body lean. Outside influences can't do this for you and if they do their efforts will be short lived because change and sexual power comes from within. The sexiest thing a guy can do is work towards: first, finding out what he wants, then who he is and where he currently stands and working ferociously to get where he needs to be.

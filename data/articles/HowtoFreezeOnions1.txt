 To prepare the onions for freezing, use a sharp knife to cut off the top ½-inch (1.3 cm). Next, slice the onion in half. Peel off the papery skin, and then chop the onion to the size you prefer..


It’s not a good idea to chop the onions any smaller than into ½-inch (1.3 cm) pieces because they may wind up becoming encased in ice when you freeze them if they’re too small.
You can slice the onions instead of chopping them if you’re freezing them for use in dishes such as fajitas.;
, When you’ve chopped the onions to your desired size, transfer them to a plastic freezer bag. Make sure to place them in the bag in a single, flat layer to prevent them from clumping together when they freeze. Squeeze all the air out of the bag, and seal it.If you’re freezing a large number of onions, prevent them from sticking together when frozen by placing them in a single layer on a shallow baking dish. Freeze them like that for two to three hours, and when they’re partially frozen, you can place them in the freezer bag without worrying about them clumping together.
Be sure to use plastic bags that are thick enough to protect the onions from freezer burn and keep the onion scent contained in the bag. If your bags seem too thin, double them up.
 Before throwing the onions in your freezer, use a pen or marker to label the bag with the date, type of onion, and when you should use them by. Place the bag flat in the freezer, making sure that the onions are still in a single layer as you position them.You can keep onions in your freezer for up to 6 months.
If you have multiple bags of onion that you’re freezing, you can stack them on top of one another to save space in the freezer. Just make sure that the onions in each bag are in a flat, single layer.

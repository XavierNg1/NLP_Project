 Verify that the problem contains a measurement of length described in centimeters (cm). It must also tell you to convert or change that value to its equivalent in meters (m).



Example: The length of a certain field is 872.5 centimeters. Find the length of the same field in meters.;
, There are exactly 100 centimeters in every 1 meter. As such, you can find the number of meters per centimeter value by dividing the centimeter measurement by 100.The "centimeter" is a smaller unit than the "meter." Every time you need to convert a smaller metric unit to a larger one, you must divide to find a lesser value.

Example: 872.5 cm / 100 = 8.725 m

The length of the field in this problem is 8.725 meters.
 The problem must contain a measurement of length described in meters (m). It will also tell you, directly or indirectly, to change that measurement to its equivalent in centimeters (cm).



Example: The width of a particular room is 2.3 meters. What is width of the same room when converted to centimeters?

, For every 1 meter, there exists 100 centimeters. This means that you can find the number of centimeters per meter value if you multiply the meter measurement by 100.The "meter" is a larger unit than the "centimeter." Every time you need to convert a larger metric unit to a smaller one, you must multiply to find a greater value.

Example: 2.3 m * 100 = 230 cm

The width of the room in this problem is 230 centimeters.
 Make sure that the problem starts with a length measurement provided in centimeters (cm). It should ask, directly or indirectly, for you to convert that centimeter value into the equivalent number of meters (m).



Example: The counter in a certain kitchen is 344.25 centimeters long. How long is the same counter when measured in meters?

, Since there are precisely 100 centimeters in every 1 meter, the centimeter value will be larger by two decimal places. You can convert the centimeter value to its meter equivalent by simply shifting the decimal point two places to the left.


Shifting the decimal point of a number to the left will cause the value to decrease. Each place holder shift represents a value of 10, so shifting the decimal to the left twice will decrease the final value by a factor of 100 (since 10 * 10 = 100).

Example: Moving the decimal point in “344.25” to the left twice would result in a value of “3.4425,” so the counter in the problem has a length of 3.4425 meters.
 Read through the problem and make sure that the length measurement is described in meters (m). The problem must also require you to change the current value to its equivalent in centimeters (cm).



Example: The store sold a length of fabric measuring 2.3 meters long. Convert the amount of fabric into centimeters.
 There are exactly 100 centimeters in every 1 meter, so the meter value will be smaller than its centimeter equivalent by two decimal places. As a result, converting the meter value to centimeters can be done by merely shifting the decimal point two spaces to the right.


Shifting the decimal place to the right makes the number larger and causes the value to increase. Each place holder represents a factor of 10, and shifting the decimal point to places to the right will ultimately increase the final value by a factor of 100 (since 10 * 10 = 100).

Example: Moving the decimal point in “2.3” to the right twice would result in a value of “230,” so the fabric in the problem measures 230 centimeters long.
 This problem requires you to convert centimeters to meters, so you will need to either divide the centimeter amount by 100 or shift the decimal two places to the left.


Mathematical Conversion:

7890 cm / 100 = 78.9 m



Decimal Shift:

7890.0 cm => shift the decimal to the left twice => 78.9 m




, For this problem, you need to convert centimeters to meters. The task can be done by either dividing the centimeter value by 100 or moving the decimal point two places to the left.


Mathematical Conversion:

82.5 cm / 100 = 0.825 m



Decimal Shift:

82.5 cm => shift the decimal to the left twice => 0.825 m




, In this problem, you need to convert meters to centimeters. Either multiply the meter value by 100 or shift the decimal point to places to the right to accomplish the required task.


Mathematical Conversion:

16 m * 100 = 1600 cm



Decimal Shift:

16.0 m => shift the decimal to the right twice => 1600 cm




, This problem tells you to convert length in meters to length in centimeters, so you'll need to either multiply the meter value by 100 or move the decimal point two places to the right of its current position.


Mathematical Conversion:

230.4 m * 100 = 23040 cm



Decimal Shift:

230.4 m => shift the decimal to the right twice => 23040 cm

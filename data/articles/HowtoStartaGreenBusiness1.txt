 Apart from brainstorming business ideas, you need to determine if the market already has a solution to your problem. If something already exists, you might not want to start a business that will be difficult to maintain and compete with other businesses. Do internet searches using keywords you have already brainstormed.


For example, if you want to make a green packaging material, Google "green packaging options" and see what comes up. If you are thinking about creating an environmentally friendly bathroom cleaner, Google "environmentally friendly bathroom cleaners" and look through the results.;
, Once you have a good idea of where your strengths and weaknesses are, you need to brainstorm how you can use your skills in starting a new business. Again, use a pen and paper to jot down questions and possible answers. Your objective here is to identify space in the market where a new green business could exist and thrive.For example, you might decide to start any of the following types of green business:


A locally-sourced grocery store, restaurant, or food truck.
A store selling green products.
An installer of energy-efficient home improvements.
An electric/hybrid transportation service., Ask yourself what big environmental problems exist and need to be solved. For example, maybe nobody has created an environmentally friendly packaging material to replace Styrofoam and plastic. As you might know, Styrofoam and plastics do not readily break down in the environment and can be hazardous to wildlife. In addition, the production of these materials is incredibly fossil fuel intensive.It may help to think of environmental problems that bug you personally. Here, ask yourself about what little problems you try to solve at home every day.
For example, maybe you send a lot of packages and you are constantly buying Styrofoam and bubble wrap. Maybe you think there is an opportunity to create a better packaging product that can even be reused.

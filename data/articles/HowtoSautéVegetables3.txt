 An alternative way to saute vegetables, for an especially tender texture, is to use a piece of parchment paper. For this variation, cut the vegetables and heat the pan as normalUse a pat of butter for your cooking fat.
 Next, add just a small splash of water, salt and pepper, and your vegetables. Again, be careful not to overcrowd the pan.
 Cover the pan loosely with a piece of parchment paper. Check the vegetables regularly. Wait for the water to evaporate.
 When the water has evaporated, remove the parchment and cook for a couple more minutes, allowing the butter to caramelize the vegetables.

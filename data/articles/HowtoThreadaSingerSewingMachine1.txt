 The most common Singer machines, no matter what year they were made, have a type of thread guide that falls into one of these categories:


A two-part thread guide is usually composed of a small metal piece and a longer plastic piece, both located on top of the machine. The thread is guided through both pieces before it continues down through the needle.
A single-part thread guide is one guide, typically metal, located at the top of the machine.

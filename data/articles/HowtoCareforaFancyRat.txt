 It is a good idea to daily wipe up any puddles of urine you might spot on shelves with kitchen roll or a non-scented baby wipe. How often they need cleaning will depend on your rats and the set up. If you fully clean the cage too frequently they will scent mark on purpose and you will notice they will smell very quickly, putting a little bit of dirty bedding in with the clean bedding helps avoid this.

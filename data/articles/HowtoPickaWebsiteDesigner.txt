 The easiest way is to Google them or look in your phone book. Also ask for recommendations from friends and colleagues, who have had positive experiences as clients.;
, It's usually easier to work with someone local, but not absolutely necessary. Ask them for references. Talk to them. See if you feel you can communicate with them, as this will be essential to the web building process.
 Any company can say they have great designs but a companyâ€™s portfolio should speak for itself. To adequately judge a website you must look at: Quality of design, ease of use, initial impressions, how the site compares to others in the same industry, consistent look throughout each site, and ease of navigation.
 Don't be afraid of bringing specific things up such as: Do they test on Mac and PC? Do they offer Search Engine Optimization? Do they use templates? Do they have their own servers? Do they consider accessibility and standards?

, Sometimes the smallest things can make all the difference. Look for:


Page titles - each page should be unique and descriptive.
Terms of use pages - every website should have a terms of use and a privacy statement.
Use of contact forms rather than published email addresses - this will reduce spam.
 Describe what you want in enough detail to be reassured by the developer's responses that she/he knows what she/he's talking about.
 Make sure the contract stipulates that a) you will own all rights to the domain name and will have access to the registrar in order to make modifications b) you will own all graphics, web pages and programs that are created for your site.

 A standard color scheme for any preppy-based style includes white, black, navy, and beige. These colors should be accented with like pastels like baby blue, soft pink, light teal, buttercup yellow, and peach.
 Button-down shirts look clean and crisp, which gives your look the polite, conservative edge needed to create an effectively preppy wardrobe. White shirts are the most versatile, but you can also throw in a few pastels.
 Cardigan sweaters are ultra feminine and classy, making them the perfect piece to throw over a plain shirt, floral blouse, or floral dress. White and cream sweaters work well, but a light pink cardigan is another classically preppy piece.
 Khaki pants are more common to the preppy style than darker dress pants and are especially well-suited for the pastel color scheme required in floral preppy outfits.
 Dark wash jeans have a dressier look than light wash jeans, making them better suited for any preppy style. Opt for a straight-leg style and avoid styles that taper or cling to your leg.
 Shorts are by no means forbidden, but short shorts should be avoided. Bermuda shorts and other styles that fall just above the knee look best for this style.
 Mini-skirts do not look conservative enough, and maxi-skirts may look too casual or frumpy. A knee-length skirt works best for the preppy style. You can either opt for a smooth A-line or pencil skirt, or look for a playful pleated skirt, instead.
 A fitted blazer creates a crisp, structured appearance that suits this style well. Throw it over a plain button-down shirt or a floral blouse.
 Avoid heels, which have a tendency to look too sexy for this style. Opt for flats during the warm weather and flat, knee-length riding boots during colder weather.
 Look for simple pieces that have a vintage or timeless look to them. Gravitate toward pearls and diamonds—or fake pearls and fake diamonds—over colored stones, and avoid loud statement pieces.

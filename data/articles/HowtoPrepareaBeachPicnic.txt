 A beach picnic could be lunchtime or evening. In very hot weather, evening is the best choice as the chances of sunburn will be removed and the warmth of the sand will be pleasant.;
, Beaches are not the best place to be setting up a barbecue, so the best option is to make sure that you select food that tastes wonderful when it is cold and to make sure that the flavours across the meal complement each other well. Some great choices for a beach picnic include:


Spreads and dips with crusty bread
Marinated vegetables
Quiche
Pasta and rice salads
Fruit salad or whole fruit
Slices of cake, cookies or brownies

, This will reduce the need for too many knives, forks and plates. However, you will probably still need serving spoons or forks for some items of food. And don't forget the serviettes - they'll be useful for removing sand as much as food crumbs!

, Take along a cooler to keep drinks chilled for the whole time you are there.
 It is much more pleasant to sit on a picnic blanket than directly on the sand. This will also help keep some sand out of the food, although this is almost inevitable anyway!

, If you have decided to have a daytime beach picnic, always include shade producing items. There is a range of shade furniture that can be taken to the beach, including large umbrellas and shade tents. In some places, a shade tent might also serve as excellent protection against insects.
 For a daytime picnic, these are essential inclusions.

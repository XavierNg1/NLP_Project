 If your cough persists, consider trying anti-cough medicines.


Cough medicines usually combine two ingredients: an expectorant, which loosens mucus, and a suppressant, which blocks the cough reflex. Check the labels to pick the one that’s best for your cough.Your doctor may be able to prescribe a cough syrup containing codeine, which can be a very effective cough suppressant. Be sure to follow the dosage instructions exactly as outlined by your doctor, as codeine has the potential to become habit-forming.
 Consider sucking on throat lozenges, eating frozen treats (such as popsicles), or gargling with salt water to sooth your throat if your cough has inflamed it.Many cough medicines contain a mild anesthetic to decrease the cough reflex. Likewise, cold items, such as popsicles, are thought to work by temporarily numbing the throat., Whether in the form of lozenges, ointments, or vapors, menthol has been shown to alleviate coughing.Menthol raises the "cough threshold," which that in increases the severity of sensations necessary to trigger a cough., If your cough is accompanied by shortness of breath, bloody mucus, severe pain, or a fever above 100.4°F (38°C) among other severe symptoms, consider seeing a doctor.

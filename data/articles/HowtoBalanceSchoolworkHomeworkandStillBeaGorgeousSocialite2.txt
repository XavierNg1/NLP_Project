 That means no smoking, drugs, sex, dressing slutty and wild, using foul language constantly and dancing inappropriately. All of these things look trashy and gross on a young lady and it makes you popular in a very BAD way.
 No matter what your personality is, you can't have a blooming social life without being nice. You don't have to compliment people all the time because too many compliments lead to them thinking you want what they have. If it's a guy, too many compliments makes him uncomfortable and makes you desperate. Instead, be subtle. Leave people guessing if it was a compliment or just a statement. Something like,"Omg, your purse reminds me of this super cute sun dress I saw at Forever 21. Nice!" Or you can say something like, "nice bag" and keep it simple.
 You don't want to be mistaken as cocky so be careful with that. But people are automatically drawn to confidence. Find something awesome about yourself, something that makes up you, and flaunt it.
 You don't have to be a whore, just be comfortable around them. You have to master the art of flirting too. Learn how to turn it on and off and turn it up a notch and down a notch. If you play your cards right you can have a date to the dance at the last moment just cause you are connected. So keep that in mind.
 Make sure you have, well, everybody's phone numbers. The jocks, the nerds, the tech kids, everyone! you never know when you might need a last minute tutor or want to know from someone when the next football game is. Befriend people on Facebook, Instagram, Kik, Twitter, Tumblr, ooVoo, Pinterest or whatever social network you fancy.

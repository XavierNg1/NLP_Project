 Eating lean meats, fish, soy, or other proteins may help to curb hair loss. Besides containing protein, many foods rich in protein also contain Vitamin B-12.
 Never brush wet hair, and avoid rubbing your hair dry with a towel. Instead, let it air dry or else blow dry it to the point of dampness, and let it dry from there.
 Sometimes, the root cause for hair loss is stress.


Practice meditation. Meditation can help to both reduce stress and restore your hormonal balance. Practicing meditation can also help you in other aspects of your life.
Get some exercise. Walk, swim, or bike for 30 to 60 minutes per day. Or, try playing a sport like tennis, so you can take out your aggression by hitting a ball. The exercise will help to lower your stress levels.
Talk or write it out. Talk to your spouse, a friend, or family member, or to a therapist about what you are experiencing. Take the time to record your feelings in a journal.
 While these may seem like good cosmetic solutions, they may also speed up hair loss by damaging your hair follicles.

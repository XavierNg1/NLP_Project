 Measure out the blueberries, sugar, and vinegar in a small saucepan. Heat this mixture over the stove, using medium heat. Slowly bring the mixture to a boil.Stir the mixture the entire time. Use a fork to gradually crush the blueberries as you stir.;
, Once your mixture has come to a boil, turn the stove off and remove the sauce pan from the heat. Use a mesh strainer to separate the juice from the berries. You will use your blueberries in the sandwich.You can store the juice in a Tupperware container and use it as a sauce for things like pancakes later.
 Spread your blueberries on one piece of your chosen bread. Place your desired amount of cheese over the berries. Then, add the spinach. If you want, you can add a dash of black pepper before topping your sandwich off with a second piece of bread.

 Add everything you want to take with you, starting with needs such as clothing and toiletries and ending with things you don't need as much. This will help you be more organized. You can also bring the list with you on your trip so you don't forget something on the way back.
 This one's pretty obvious but also very important. Bring one to two more tops than the days you're traveling and one to two less pants/shorts than the days you're traveling. Make sure you bring a bathing suit no matter where you're going in case there's a place to swim on your trip. Roll clothes instead of folding them to save room, and put socks and underwear into plastic bags to stuff in your shoes to keep their shape and save space., If your trip is at least a night, you'll probably find yourself taking a shower and wanting to wash your hair. While every girl uses different products, some good things to bring are:

Shampoo, conditioner, and body soap (travel sizes work best)
Lotion (also travel sized)
Hand sanitizer
Toothbrush and toothpaste
Hairbrush
Pads or tampons if needed
Makeup if you wear any
Makeup remover if you bring makeup

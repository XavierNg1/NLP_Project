 The shears are for smaller branches, and the loppers are for thick canes. Make sure your tools are sharp so they will make clean cuts rather than causing tears and rips in the stems.
 Rinse them again before moving on to another bush. This step disinfects your shears and prevents the transfer of diseases, such as black spot, between the plants.
 This way water will run off of the "wound" instead of collecting there. It helps prevent disease and mold from growing on the rose bush. The slope of the angle should head toward the center of the plant.
 The bud eyes, also called bud unions, are the swelling reddish knobs on the canes of the rosebush. Bud eyes produce the rosebush's branches. Making cuts just above the bud eyes redirects the plant's energy to a bud eye, so a branch will form there. Choose bud eyes that are facing outward so that the branches grow out, rather than into the center of the bush.
 This isn't absolutely necessary, but it's a good idea if you have pest problems in your area. It prevents rose boring insects from invading, and helps prevent stem diseases.

 Strategize ways to get your opponents out including using dodgeball rules to be able to direct the ball at an opponent instead of the wall so that she drops it and is then out. You may also distract your opponents before he tries to receive the ball so that he fumbles it and is penalized with a strike.You may throw at the direction of players you know are scared to catch the ball to build on the nerves and increase the likelihood that they will fumble and be out of the game.
Dare a bad thrower to throw in your direction if you know you can catch it and get him out.
 Use the rules to your advantage. For example, if you are playing with rules like “left handsies” where everyone must only catch with their left hand, aim at player’s right hand so that it makes it difficult for them to reach over and catch it with there left.


You may also throw the ball close to the end line so that a receiving player may be forced to step out of bounds if she attempts to catch it.
 The thrower has an automatic advantage because only she knows where the ball will go. If you have good aim and timing you will be able to continue your turn as the thrower as you get other players out. However, this may be difficult if you do not start as the thrower. Look to catch the ball if the server fumbles or for similar opportunities to establish yourself as the new thrower.

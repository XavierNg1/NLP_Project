 The plate needs to be wide enough to cover your face, so a dinner-sized plate is recommended. Make sure that the plate is plain. This way, the original designs won't show through when you paint it.Save the other half of the plate for another project or make a second mask for a friend.
 Find the middle of the mask. Next, cut a U-shaped groove into the bottom straight edge. How big you cut the groove depends on how big your nose bridge is. You want the mask to be able to rest on your nose.If you want a cat eye mask instead, cut a U-shaped groove into the top, curved edge instead

, Place the mask over your face, like a pair of sunglasses. Gently feel where your eyes are, then make marks using a pencil. Sketch out a pair of almond-shaped eye holes with a pencil right over the marks. Cut the eye holes out.If a young crafter is making this mask, he or she will need and adult to help them with this step.
For a more precise cut, use a craft blade.
 You can apply the paint using a large paintbrush or a foam brush. Make sure that you coat the entire mask with paint. You can make your mask any color you want, but purple, green, and yellow/gold are traditional Mardi Gras colors. Let the paint dry before moving on.This step can get a little messy. It would be a good idea to work on top of some newspaper.
 Let your imagination go wild here. The fancier your mask is, the better. Try some glitter glue, sequins, rhinestones, and feathers. You can even paint additional designs onto the mask as well!, Flip the mask over so that the back is facing you. Secure a dowel to one of the sides. Hot glue would be the best, but you can use a few strips of tape as well.You can also use a chop stick or a sturdy straw.
Consider decorating your dowel first with a ribbon or rhinestones.

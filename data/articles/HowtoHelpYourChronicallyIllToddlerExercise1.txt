 If your child has an illness that causes muscle atrophy or restrictive movements, certain activities involved in exercise may not be advisable.


For instance, if your child has permanently contracted hand muscles, exercise involving throwing or grabbing is likely to frustrate your toddler.;
, Most pediatricians can give reliable opinions on the safety of exercise options that involve balance and coordination, such as dancing, jumping, bicycling, and running.


If your toddler’s illness affects balance or coordination, exercises that rely heavily on these characteristics may be dangerous for your child.
 In some cases, most exercise for your toddler should be first demonstrated by a physical therapist and then repeated with your guidance during exercise sessions.


Children with less restrictive illnesses may be able to safely engage in a wide variety of exercise options when they are feeling well. Your child’s symptoms will be the guide of how much and what types of exercise are appropriate.

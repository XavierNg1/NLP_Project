 With BMP, file quality can be maintained when file is resized, and it loads quickly since it is not compressed. But, it cannot be used on the Web and it has a large file size.;
, TIF images can be very high resolution and can be used by most scanning and graphics programs. However, it also has large file size, but it supports various lossless compression schemes (image isn’t degraded when file is compressed), so they can be smaller than a corresponding BMP image without a loss of quality.
 GIF format has small file size, can be used on any browser, can be animated, transparent, or regular, has lossless compression (image doesn’t degrade when file size is reduced). Unfortunately, it can contain only 256 colors or fewer and is 8-bit only. Never send a gif to a printer or a design agency for artwork that is designed to be printed. The end result will look terrible and the designer will not thank you for it.
 JPG's contain millions of colors (24-bit palette). On the other hand, they use a lossy compression scheme -- when files are reduced in size, image is degraded because of a LOSS of information -- and may take longer to load because of decompression time.
 This image type can be 8-bit, 24-bit or 32-bit, has lossless compression, is endorsed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), can store alpha channel (variable) transparency, supports gamma correction (cross-platform control of image brightness), and supports two-dimensional interlacing (a method of progressive display). The drawback is that it is not supported by older browsers.
, These preserve vectors and are less likely to cause print issues.

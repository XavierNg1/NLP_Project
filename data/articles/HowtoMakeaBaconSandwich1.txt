 This will take about 5 minutes. When you are done, place the bacon on a plate lined with paper towels so that the excess grease can drain., This will be on the outside of your sandwich and help make it extra crispy when you grill it., Save the rest of the cheese for the other half of the sandwich. This will help "glue" your sandwich together so that it doesn't fall apart.
 If you don't like guacamole, you can either leave it out or use a few thin slices of avocado instead.
 Make sure that the buttered side is facing up. This will help prevent the sandwich from sticking to the skillet.
 Place a skillet on the stove, and turn the heat up to medium. When the skillet is hot, place the sandwich on top and grill it for 2 to 3 minutes.
 Carefully flip it over using a spatula, then cook it until it turns golden brown and the cheese is melted., This will make the sandwich easier to eat so that it doesn't fall apart on you.
 Put the sandwich pieces on a plate and serve it promptly. If you'd like to go an extra step, stick frilled sandwich or cocktail pick through center of each sandwich half to help hold it together.

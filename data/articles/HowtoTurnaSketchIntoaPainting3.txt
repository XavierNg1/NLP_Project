 In many schools, colleges, art institutions, etc, they will have a wide range of equipment available to you which make the method easier. Your sketch can be enlarged via scanner and then scanned and printed directly onto a plastic film for use in a professional projector.


If you're at home instead, this method can be easily replicated with some low-tech tricks, such as tracing over your sketch with a marker onto a plastic pocket, then creating a makeshift frame for the plastic pocket to stand on.
 Make sure to have drawn all lines before moving your canvas.
 Once drawn on with pencil, your painting is ready to paint! Your lines can be drawn over with a marker, black paint, fine liner, etc. The rest of the painting is up to you!

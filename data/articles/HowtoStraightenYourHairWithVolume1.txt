 This is very important. It won't do much to give your hair extra volume, but it will protect your hair from heat damage, and prevent it from turning brittle and dry. Be sure to focus the heat protectant on the ends of your hair, which tend to get damaged the easiest.;
, Plan on straightening your hair in at least three layers. If you have very thick hair, or just a lot of it, you will have to work in thinner sections., Take a small, 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) section of hair, and clamp your iron over it, as close as you can to your scalp without burning yourself.
 Instead of pulling the iron straight down, pull it upwards towards the ceiling by a few inches/centimeters. When you get halfway across your hair, pull the iron away from your head. Pulling the iron upwards helps create volume, while pulling it away makes it easier on your arm.If your hair is too hot for you to touch, use a hairbrush to handle it. It might also be a good sign that your hair straightener is set to too high of a temperature; you might want to lower the temperature a little.
 Once you are done, you can move on to the next layer, or gently tease your hair first. If you choose to tease your hair, give it a quick spray with a flexible hairspray to set the style while allowing movement and flow., Always work in layers and small sections. Remember, the thicker your hair is, the more layers you will have to work with.
 Run your fingers upwards through your hair, starting at the roots. This will give your hair that final lift it needs. If you want to, give your hair a spray with some texturizing hairspray.

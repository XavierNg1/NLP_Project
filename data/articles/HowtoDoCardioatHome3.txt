Turns out, jumping jacks are a great form of cardio you can do anywhere. All you need to do is start with your legs together and your arms at your side. Jump your legs out to each side and bring your arms up, moving them straight out and then up.

You can use it to go up hills, or just try for longer and longer distances. Remember, try to push yourself harder at some points, and then give yourself a minute to ride easier., Another simple exercise you can do at home is to box. If you don't have a bag, don't worry. Just pick up some small weights to use. You can even use canned goods. Then just spend some time punching the air. Don't forget to move your feet as you go.

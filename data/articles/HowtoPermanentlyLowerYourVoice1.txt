 Your voice will be its most natural and powerful when it comes from the area just behind and around your nose. In order to practice speaking from this place, hum mmm-hmm, as if you were responding to a question affirmatively. Feel the vibration in your face as you hum. This is where you should focus on speaking from., Breathing from your diaphragm as opposed to your chest will make your voice both more powerful and deeper. When you breathe, your stomach should rise, and your chest and shoulders should remain still. These are full, diaphragm breaths., You want your breath to come from your diaphragm, and go out through the part of your face you identified in step one. Practice this often, saying anything you like, but focusing on these two parts of your body. You will notice that you can get more power in your voice with less vocal strain, resulting in a louder, deeper voice., At first, breathing this way will feel unnatural and you'll probably switch back to your normal way of breathing and speaking often. But if you practice for a couple of weeks, as often as you can remember, eventually it will become second nature. Learning to breathe from your diaphragm is one of the easiest ways to naturally improve your voice.

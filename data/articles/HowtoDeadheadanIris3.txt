 Irises will benefit from a feed in the early spring. Try to use a fertilizer that is relatively low in nitrogen relative to potash (potassium) and phosphorus.


High nitrogen fertilizers are thought to promote rot in Iris rhizomes.
 Avoid mulching on top of your Irises’ rhizomes to avoid rot. A rhizome is a horizontal stem that grows out from the center of the plant. You can put a shallow mulch that is roughly two inches in depth around the plant, but you should make sure that the mulch doesn’t cover the rhizomes and the center of the plant.Avoid using manure, even at planting time.
 It can take quite a while to germinate Iris seed so you may have better results and faster ones by dividing the rhizome. Dividing the rhizome every few years also helps maintain the plant’s performance.This should be done about 6 weeks after flowering. It’s fine to deadhead your Iris plant thoroughly if you are planning to divide it.
 Irises don’t tend to need a lot of watering but you may like to water your plants occasionally during dry weather. Try to give your plant a good amount of water once a week rather than giving the plant a small amount of water more frequently.


Avoid over-watering as this makes the rhizome prone to rot.
It’s especially important to water over the summer if you have a variety that will rebloom the same year. Varieties that only flower in the spring don’t need as much summer attention.
 If you want to get seeds from your Iris, limit your deadheading and let at least one flowerhead remain after flowering so that the seedhead develops there.


Bear in mind the resulting plants will vary in appearance and won’t necessarily be like the parent plant.
 Growing Iris from seed usually involves soaking them for at least 2 days beforehand. Many gardeners pre-chill the seeds by storing them in the fridge beforehand.

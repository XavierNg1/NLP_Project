If you are afraid of holding it or if its in a windy situation you could use a fuse. Fuse could be bought in stores or you could create it from paper. To do it, you need to take a paper (size depends on your bomb), wrap 1/2 of the bomb using the paper but, if you wrap them all, the result is that it wouldn't smoke, but a huge fire. So, after folding it 1/2 of the bomb, you need to make a tail out of it. Now as usual, light up the tail. Yes it's slow but its better if you do this on windy days.

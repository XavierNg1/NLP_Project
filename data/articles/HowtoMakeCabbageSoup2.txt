 Place the olive oil in a large stockpot and heat it up for a minute or two over medium-high heat. Add the chopped potatoes and the salt, and stir them to coat with olive oil. Cook the potatoes until they are soft, which should take about 10 minutes.








Don't overcook the potatoes, since they'll keep cooking with the rest of the soup ingredients.
You can wait and add the salt later if you'd like, but adding it now will allow it to blend more evenly with the natural taste of the potato. Adding it later, however, will make it easier to adjust the final taste of the soup (simply add it when adjusting the seasonings toward the end of the recipe).
 Place them in the pot with the potatoes and stir. Keep cooking the mixture until the onions turn translucent, which should only take three to five minutes.









Stir frequently to prevent the garlic and onions from burning. If either one burns, it could ruin the taste of the potatoes, even if you remove the burnt garlic or onion from the pan.
 Pour the broth into the pot, then add the beans. Stir the mixture with a long-handled spoon. Bring the broth to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce it to low so that the broth is at a simmer.
 Stir well after adding them to the soup. Cook the soup for 30 minutes, or until the cabbage is tender. Taste and add more salt and pepper as desires.









The soup is ready once everything is tender and the taste is to your liking. Serve the soup with a dollop of sour cream or some grated cheese.

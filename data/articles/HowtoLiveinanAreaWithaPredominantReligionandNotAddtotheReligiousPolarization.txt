 While it may not conform with your beliefs, it is important that inter-faith respect be promoted and actively observed. You can set a great example by showing this respect.;
, Do not try to place one religion above another but see them as faith in general. Lead by example and others will feel comfortable in following this style of communication.
 It might be something as simple as a potluck supper, or something as elaborate as a food fair where you provide the neighborhood with the opportunity to sample different fare associated with the cultures behind each religion.
 Priests tend to have the respect of their religious community and are an important means through which any inter-religious unrest can be prevented.
 Have open days where the different faiths can be explored by the neighborhood.
 Show interest and obey their requests for different ways of dress, seating, etc. This will help to increase your understanding and respect for the other religion and provides you with an opportunity to meet key people in the other religion who can help explain things that you are curious about.

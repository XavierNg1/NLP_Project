 You only need enough water to slightly moisten the sugar; don't add enough to dissolve it. The blackstrap molasses in the brown sugar helps to exfoliate your face and leave it gleaming and healthy.Use brown sugar instead of white or powdered sugar for best effect.
If you have acne, add a few drops of tea tree oil or lavender oil to the scrub. These have antiseptic properties that help get rid of acne.
 Make sure your makeup is removed and rinse your face with water, then pat it mostly dry. Keep it a little moist so the scrub will go on more easily.
 Scrub your face in gentle, wide, circular upstrokes to exfoliate the dead skin. Keep gently scrubbing your face until the sugar has dissolved. If you wish, you can leave the scrub on your face for a few minutes to use it as a mask as well.
 Use warm water and make sure you rinse it out of the corners of your eyes and other hard-to-reach areas, so your face doesn't remain sticky. Pat your face dry with a towel.
 Apply moisturizer all over your face to help hydrate your skin, since using a scrub can be drying.

 Find the center of the watermelon and cut through the fruit at the mid-point., Set the fruit on your cutting board so the rind faces up and the flesh faces down, then cut each piece in half again.
 Take one of the quarters and slice into Â½ in (1.3 cm) wedges. Repeat until all the fruit is cut up.

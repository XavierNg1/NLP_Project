 If there are other animals in the house, the cat may feel uncomfortable eating, as it tries to compete for food. If you section off a room where you can feed just that cat, it can increase the chances of the cat eating., Smaller meals throughout the day may seem counter-intuitive, but it can actually encourage your cat to eat. If your cat doesn't have a large appetite, it may be overwhelmed by a large bowl of food., Some cats want attention when they're eating. Try stroking your cat and talking soothingly to it while it's eating. You can also try a bit of petting if your cat is near the bowl but not eating. This tactic won't work with every cat, though, so if your cat seems disturbed by the attention, leave it alone., If the cat has been sick, it may not be smelling very well. Wiping the cat's nose and trying to remove discharge may help it smell better. In turn, it may be more interested in food because it can smell it., A cat who hasn't been interested in food may be more inclined to eat if you hand feed it. For canned food, you can put a little on your finger and offer it to the cat. For dry food, place a bit in your hand, and hold it out for the cat to eat.

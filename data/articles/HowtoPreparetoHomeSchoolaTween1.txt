 Writing for a long period of time will make their little hands ache. You will not need much for a child between these ages.;
, Smaller pencils, hard wearing rubbers and slightly shorter rulers are good.

Put up bright, attractive posters with good mottos on up on the walls (eg Learning is fun with a kid reading a joke book, or 'Reading is Useful' with a toilet door with 'Pull' written on it, and someone trying really hand to push it open)






Write out the alphabet in bright letters and stick them on the walls, along with numbers 1 - 25, as a reminder for your child.






Buy a cheap blackboard, and a lot of white, blue and green chalk. If you write in green and blue a child may be more attracted to try to read it.






Buy lots of paper, paint, pens and coloured pencils for 'art' lessons, along with a good stack of newspaper to protect the tables.






Consider discipline. Are you in a state where they paddle the kids at school? Do you believe in paddling? Do you live in England where corner times are a traditional punishment for naughty 3 - 6 year old children? Do you believe in smacking but you live in England where schools don't do it? Now you can decide how to punish your children when they are naughty in school!






Buy plenty of lined and plain exercise books from your local stationary shop.

 You can serve God by being a mentor or positive role model to someone who may be younger than you, or even around your age.


Perhaps you have a younger family member who needs guidance, or you could join a Big Brother/Big Sister program.
Putting someone ahead of you and helping others is a great way to serve.
 Volunteering is another great way to serve God and can be done in many ways.


You can volunteer at a local food shelter or soup kitchen.
You can also serve God through cleaning up your neighborhood or being part of a neighborhood watch, and protecting those in your community you love.
Remember that serving God can be as simple as helping out a neighbor with a small task or favor, and doesn’t have to be a big grand gesture.
 If you’ve studied your bible you’ll know that there are countless passages about only taking what you need and helping others by giving what you don’t need.This is a great way to serve God as you can easily look around your home and find things you don’t use or need anymore to give away.
Instead of throwing out old clothes or furniture you can donate them to places like Goodwill.
You can also donate any extra canned food you may have to your local food shelter.
 You can always serve God by being the Good Samaritan. If you see someone in need try to help them.


You don’t have to do something grand as helping someone can be as simple as opening a door picking up something someone may have dropped.
 Remember a time when someone helped you out with something? Well, now it’s your turn. Do the same for someone who could use your help.


Maybe someone let you merge ahead in traffic or in a line at the store. Now it’s your time to do the same for someone else.
Paying it forward is a great way to serve God and doing something good for someone else will make you feel good as well. It’s a win-win

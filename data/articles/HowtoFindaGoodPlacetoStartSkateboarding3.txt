 If possible, choose surfaces with low-grade asphalts. This will help you avoid hitting rocks and falling. Swerve around older parts of the road to stay on newer parts of the road.Keep in mind that may be illegal in your city to skateboard on the street.


Never “hitch a ride” by grabbing onto the back of a car. Also called “skitching,” this activity is incredibly dangerous and can lead to fatalities.Use Google Maps to help you chart a good course in advance., If your city has bike lanes in the roads, use them. These lanes are generally well-maintained and provide a smoother surface for skateboarding. Furthermore, pedestrians and cars aren’t allowed in this lane, so you won’t have to worry about running into them. Keep in mind that some cities have laws against skateboarders using the bike lane. Call your local police department to find out whether or not you can do this.


Stay on the right side of the lane while skating. If you need to pass someone, pass on their left. Make sure to warn them as you approach by yelling, “On your left!”
Obey all traffic laws while using the bike lane., Skateboards are great modes of transportation. However, your chances of sustaining a serious injury are greatly increased when you don’t wear protective equipment on an uneven surface. Unlike a skate park, the surfaces you’ll be skating on will be irregular and can change unpredictably.


Protective equipment includes helmets, knee pads, elbow pads, and shin guards.
This equipment can be bought at most sports department stores and skate supply shops.

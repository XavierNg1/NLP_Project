 The worms that cause lymphatic filariasis are spread person-to-person through mosquito bites. Avoiding mosquito bites when in endemic areas is the best way to avoid infection, though it generally takes months to years of repeated bites to become infected.Protect yourself at night when mosquitoes are most active.


Obtain a mosquito net for your bed to limit the pests’ access to you while you sleep.If possible, sleep in an air-conditioned room with closed windows., The mosquitoes that transmit LF usually bite between dusk and dawn. When possible, limit your time outdoors in endemic areas to after dawn and before dusk – i.e. largely during daytime hours., As much as possible, wear long sleeve shirts, long pants, and socks. Cover as much skin as possible to minimize areas for mosquito bites., Obtain a natural or chemical mosquito repellent and be diligent about using it regularly.Effective repellents usually contain either DEET, icaridin (or picaridin), or the oil of lemon eucalyptus.Apply mosquito repellent outside, away from food, and at least 20 minutes after putting on sunscreen if you’re using both.
Cover up any rashes, wounds, burns, or cuts before putting on mosquito repellent.
 Those actively infected with LF can take a yearly dose of a medication called diethylcarbamazine (DEC). This drug does not kill all of the worms, but it prevents you from spreading the disease to another person.


If you live in North America or another area where LF is not common, your doctor will have to get this medication from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or other agency that deals with rare disorders.The medication is usually well tolerated, with minor possible side effects of dizziness, headache, fever, nausea, or muscle aches.Other treatment options are ivermectin and albendazole.

 The bass clef looks almost just like the treble clef, which is the staff you likely learned first. However, the bass clef is read differently. In general, the bass clef is used to denote the deeper, left-hand notes on Staff: This is the collection of five lines and four spaces that music is written on. Notes can go above and below the staff as well. Each line and space matches a specific note.

Ledger Lines: Lines above or below the staff, added to expand the staff. Remember, however, that they all must have spaces between them as well, which indicate notes.

Bass Clef: This is the backward "C" on the left-hand side of the staff. The top of the clef should touch the very top line of the staff. If this symbol is different (like a cursive "S" or strange "B") you do not have a bass clef.


Advanced music theory tip: Lowering the bass clef to the second highest line creates a "baritone clef." Raising it above the top line indicates a "sub-bass clef.";
, The lowest space (the one between the bottom line and the second lowest line) represents an A. The space above it represents a C, then an E, then a G. Thus, the notes in the spaces, form the bottom up, can be remembered thusly:


-------

Grass
-------

Eat
-------

Cows
-------

All
-------, The very lowest line is a G, then a B, then a D, F, and finally A. You can make up any mnemonic you'd like, but the classic is always easy to keep in mind:


---Airplanes---
_________
---Fly----
_________
---Don't----
_________
---Bears----
_________
---Grizzly----, Don't worry if you hate thinking about bears or cows. There are a variety of other mnemonics available, and you could even invent your own if you wanted. Remember that all of these count from the bottom up, because the notes go from lowest to highest.



Spaces:

Ants Can Eat Grapes
American Composers Envy Gershwin



Lines:

Great Beagles Dig For Artwork
Good Bikes Don't Fall Apart
Garbage Bags Do Fly Away., The bass clef simply moves through the alphabet, with each line and space representing one "move." So, since the bottom line is a G, the space above it is an A. The line above that space is a B. The next space is a C, and so on, until you get back to another A on the top line. This will also help you with the lines above and below the staff. Simply work through the alphabet, counting each space and line equally:Your middle C is on the first ledger line above the staff. The space beneath it is a B.
The space right below the staff is an F, and the first ledger line beneath it is an E.

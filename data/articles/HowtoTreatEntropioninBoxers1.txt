 There are specific symptoms that will develop in your Boxer if he has entropion. Notice if your Boxer blinks one or both eyes excessively, which is due to the eyelash or fur bothering the eye. Your Boxer may also rub excessively at this eye, have excessive watering in this eye, have a buildup of pus in the eye, or become overly sensitive to light.In many cases, entropion may also cause a scratch on your Boxer's cornea, which may lead to the development of an ulcer.This eye irritation, if left untreated, may lead to a buildup of dark scar tissue on the cornea of your Boxer's eye, which is called pigmentary keratitis. This condition may lead to a partial loss of your Boxer's vision or a blurring of his vision due to the buildup of scar tissue buildup.In rare cases, the ulcer may lead to a perforation on your Boxer's eye, which causes pain and may lead to potential blindness or loss of the eyeball.;
, Entropion can only be officially diagnosed by taking your Boxer to the veterinarian. Your vet will examine your Boxer and decide if his eyelid or eyelids are inverted or folded inwards, which is the cause of the entropion. Your vet will also check your Boxer's eye for any damage made by the folding, such as scratches, scarring, or ulcers.


Ulcers or scarring will be diagnosed by performing a stain test on your Boxer's eye.
This condition typically arises within the first year of a Boxer's life. This is because the symptoms are so noticeable and irritating for your dog., Entropion is a condition where a portion of your Boxer's eyelid folds in and under on its own accord. This physical abnormality causes the lid to come into contact with your Boxer's eyeball surface or cornea. When this happens, the eyelashes or the fur on your Boxer's eyelids irritate the eye, which causes the physical symptoms.


This causes your Boxer's eye to tear or become reddened.
If left untreated, your Boxer's condition will only get worse and may result in the loss of the eye.

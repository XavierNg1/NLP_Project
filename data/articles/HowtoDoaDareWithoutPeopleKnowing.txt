 Figure out how much trouble you would get in if you were caught.;
, How long does the dare take? Is it a small or big thing? How much evidence would there be left, and where, when, who, what, how and why you take the dare?

, Do it in a very secret place. If it will make any suspicious sound, make sure it is soundproof.
 If it involves being close to someone you do not want to see the dare in action, be really careful, when they turn around and see you, have an excuse ready.
 If you mess something up badly, like break something, you will have to handle that yourself.
 It's okay as long as you are not making it really complicated and way more hard to do.
 See if they start to think its boring and go away. Pretend that you were going to get something or do something else.
 Do your dare as fast as you can, and hide from everything possible. If you get caught, then make up an excuse, like if your sister sees you snooping around somewhere, things may get suspicious so you can tell her that you were just playing a spying game or training to be junior spies in a virtual game you made up.
 If you just did something hard to accomplish and didn't get caught, then most other dares will seem easy to you. Congratulations. You have completed a hard dare!

, Those are just the results of the dare you just accomplished without getting caught!

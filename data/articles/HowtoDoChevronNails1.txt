, It is up to you if you want to cut enough tape strips to make a chevron design on each of your nails or just do a couple.









Make sure that the tape strips will completely cover the width of each of your nails.
Attach the strips to the edge of a table by pressing a corner of the tape onto the bottom of the table's edge, just don’t press too hard.
 Use the pinking shears to cut each 1” strip of tape into a thin zigzagged strip. Cut along the long edges of the tape to make each strip.








Apply the strips to your nails as you make them or reattach the strips to the table's edge until you are ready to use them.

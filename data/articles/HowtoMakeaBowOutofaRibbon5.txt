 Along with loops, tails are a distinctive part of how a bow turns out. Not all bow designs have tails, but for those that do, making them appear neat and sharp is important.
 Make sure that the tails are as long as possible when making bows. You can always cut them shorter but it's near impossible to make them longer without ruining the loops of the bow.
 Cutting the tails prevents fraying of the ribbon and neatens the final look. Use a sharp pair of scissors suitable for cutting fabric. The ends of tails can be cut into distinctive ways:









Diagonally: This is a cut along a diagonal line along the tail fabric.
Chevron: Choose a center point at the end of the ribbonâ€™s tail. Cut diagonally to this point from the left and then the right side. Meet the two in the middle at the chosen point. Carefully remove the cut piece if it hasn't already fallen away.

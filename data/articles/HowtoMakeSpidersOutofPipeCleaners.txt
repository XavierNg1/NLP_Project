 To start, have your pipe cleaners out and ready.;
, Lay them out in front of you.
 Now you should have four, 1/3 pieces of pipe cleaner, and one 2/3 piece.
 this will be the head of your spider. If you have large thumbs, wrap it only around the tip of your thumb. In the end, the head of your spider should be about the size of a dime, or no bigger than a quarter.
 This means start at the base of the head, and all of the left over pipe cleaner should be wound tightly, like a coil. This will be the body of your spider.
 At the base of the head, just before your coil starts, wrap it around the body once.
 You should now have 4 "legs" sticking out on either side of your spider's body.
 Arrange the legs so that the spider is able to stand on its own, with the legs supporting it above the table.
 Pay attention to the surface that you are using. For example, don't put glue all over your walls.
 this is great if you place the spider in a doorway for somebody to walk into on the way out of the room.

 If you have used your washer to clean especially dirty items or dyed items, it may be getting pretty stained up. Use a mixture of ½ cup bleach to 1 gallon (3.8 L) water to clean areas that are stained. This mixture should reduce, or eliminate, the stains., The drawers or compartments used to deliver detergent into the machine can be cleaned with bleach as well. Even the bleach drawer or compartment can get a scrub down. Take a cloth covered in a diluted bleach and water mixture and wipe down all the surfaces on the drawer or compartment.Even though you run soap and bleach through these areas, they can have dirt and debris build up. This is especially true of the detergent compartment, because of the sticky nature of liquid detergent.
 To avoid getting bleach stains on your clothes in the future, you should rinse areas you have cleaned with bleach or wipe then down again with a cloth covered in warm water. Getting rid of bleach residue after cleaning with it can really minimize the risk of accidental bleaching.

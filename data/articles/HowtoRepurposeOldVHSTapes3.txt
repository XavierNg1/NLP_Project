 Essentially you can use VHS tape the same way as you would any other crafting string or twine. Braid or try macram√© with the tape for a fashionable look.
 Consider weaving charms or other interesting pieces into your VHS bracelet.



Braid multiple pieces of VHS tape together by securing the ends with either a hot glue gun or even duct tape depending on the style you desire.
Use the tape as your actual necklace and then hang an interesting charm or piece on the end.

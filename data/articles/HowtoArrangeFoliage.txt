 Leaves aren't just green. They come in a range of green shades, from light to dark, from plain to patterned, with acid-yellows, pale translucent greens, mottled grey-blues, etc. The variety is infinite and only limited by your ability to obtain different leaf types.;
, Equally as interesting and varied as leaf colours, the textures and shapes of leaves are an important part of creating a good foliage display. For example, consider the different shapes and textures of:


A maple leaf
A sweetcorn leaf
A cabbage leaf
A camellia leaf
An English ivy leaf
A flax leaf
A beetroot leaf
A rhubarb leaf.
 Again, there is a lot of variety here and you can create layered dimensions using light and heavy leaves together, or singly. Look for:


Leaves that are very light and feathery
Leaves that are very coarse, strong, and heavy - firm leaves will often last a long time.
 Some leaves are better during certain seasons. The following rundown will help you:


Spring: Tulip, daffodil, chestnut, hellebore, iris, ivy
Summer: Globe artichoke, hosta, privet, gladioli, ginger, beetroot, Swiss chard, willow

Autumn: Azalea, magnolia, broom, geranium, rose, beetroot
Winter: Laurel, ivy, periwinkle, camellia, rhododendron, magnolia.



Place heavier leaves at the back or base.
Place lighter leaves at the front, or above.
If adding flowers, use flowers at the back and front, to create a sense of depth.
Group varieties of flowers, colours, and textures rather than placing them haphazardly.
 Push each stem firmly into the arrangement foam or other floral aid to ensure the arrangement sits well.


Ensure that there is some water in the container.
Remove leaves that sit beneath the water line or they will rot and go foul.
Crush or split woody ends before placing in water.
 To make the appearance of the leaves brighter, rub with olive oil. This will brighten shiny leaves, as well as removing any stains.


Trim off any scraggly, withered, brown, damaged or diseased parts of the leaf display.

 In some word processing programs, it may be necessary to double click. The image is ready to resize when handles, which are small circles or squares, appear at the corners, along each side and in the middle of the picture.
 With your mouse, holding down the left button (or main button on a Mac), you can move these handles closer to or further away from the image center. This allows you to make a picture skinnier until it fits your specifications.

 Find an envelope, a nice piece of wallpaper, and a sheet of cardstock. Ideally, your envelope color should match the color of your wallpaper.


The size of your envelope will determine how much wallpaper you will need.
Your wallpaper, when folded in half, needs to be at least 1/8" (.3 cm) smaller on all sides than the envelope. To easily determine if the wallpaper is the right size, trace two envelopes on the back of the wallpaper.
 Then, fold it in half. If the wallpaper curls, place it under a book or paper weight overnight so it can flatten out.
 Adhere the cardstock to the back of the wallpaper with glue or double-sided tape.


Use your hand to smooth out any bubbles or creases.
Some wallpaper comes with a sticky backing. If this is the case, simply peel off the backing and attach the wallpaper to the cardstock.
 Choose a saying, phrase, or joke that the recipient will appreciate on their birthday.


Use a nice pen or pencil to write a message or saying.
For a cleaner look, use a word processor to create a message in nice font and then print it out to attach to the inside of the card.

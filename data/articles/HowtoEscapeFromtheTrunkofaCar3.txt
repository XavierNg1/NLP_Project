 The vast majority of trunk entrapment cases occur in the victim's own car. The good news is, you can prepare for such an eventuality by installing a trunk release. Check if your car already has a trunk release in the trunk. If it doesn't you may be able to install one as long as yours has an operational electronic trunk release mechanism.

If your trunk can be opened remotely, the easiest thing to do is to hide a spare remote in the trunk. Make sure to tell your children and other family members where it is located and how it is operated.






If your trunk cannot be opened remotely,you can purchase the supplies to install a trunk release yourself for about $4. Have the release installed for you if you are not confident in your mechanical abilities.
 Keep a flashlight, crowbar, and a screwdriver in your trunk. If you can't install a trunk release, keep tools in your trunk that will help you pry open the latch or, at the very least, help you attract attention from passersby.

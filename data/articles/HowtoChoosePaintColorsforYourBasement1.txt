 It is a common misconception that dark rooms should be painted light colors. In fact, light colors need an abundance of light to realize their potential; otherwise they tend to look drab, dull, and even dirty. The best way to counter the low light levels in a basement is by painting with rich, deep hues.Basement paint colors do not necessarily need to be dark, but they should be richly saturated. So, a highly saturated, medium-toned turquoise will often perform better than a dark-toned gray paint.;
, The more light a room receives, the better the paint will look regardless of color. This gives you more options in brighter rooms. Near windows and in rooms with plenty of electric light, you can use whites and off-whites as well as rich colors or dark tones., Choosing the right sheen is an important part of choosing your basement paint. The type of sheen can determine how light reflects off your painted walls (an especially important consideration for a basement), how visible imperfections in the walls are, and also how easy it will be to keep the space looking clean.If your basement is damp and tends be affected by mold, choose a satin paint finish. These kinds of paints can withstand moisture better than other types.
 How your basement is currently finished will, in some ways, determine what colors you should paint the space. For instance, if you have exposed brick walls, you might want to consider painting the adjacent wall a cool, refreshing color like mint green or pale blue.For rooms with finished drywall walls and carpeted floors, richer colors would be more appropriate.

 If not, it will fall apart during the first few songs.;
,, This part is not easy. A good bet is to simply hold a free concert right outside of your garage. This way you can play in the garage. Meaning you don't have to move any instruments, the people can listen from the driveway, and you don't have to charge anything.
 But you're still putting your name in their mind, so if they have a party chances are they'll let you play it.
 Their guests will see you and start spreading the word about your band.
, If they need a band to open for them, they might just call upon you.
 It is an excellent way to get to know bands and even venues because most of them have one.
 Musicians always have a plan of what they're going to play, even if they act like they don't. A set usually consists of 4 or 5 songs. A concert usually has 3 sets. Encores are 2 songs, but don't expect an encore your first concert. The reason that concerts are split into sets is so the musicians can get a short rest and do something -besides play- to entertain the crowd.
 First tracks on any rock CD's are good. Then another heavy song, then a lighter one, then finish off the set with another heavy song.
 Same for the last set. Except for the last song. Play a really powerful song that will make them want to come back for more, like a ballad with really heavy distortion.
 The crowd will usually be easy-going. The best way to connect with them is through casually conversing and joking around with them. Who hates conversation, right? Don't go overboard until you know the crowd is on your side! Once you start playing shows where you know the people came to see you, feel free to go crazy, but otherwise, going too far will make you look like an idiot. Still move and jump around of course, but setting stuff on fire for example, can be too much depending on the circumstances.

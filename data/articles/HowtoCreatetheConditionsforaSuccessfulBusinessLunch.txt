 If you go during the rush part of the lunch hour in your city, it'll be noisier and there will be more tension in the atmosphere. Perhaps this is what you're seeking but if not, consider booking the table or lounge area for a time during lunch that isn't so busy or rushed.


Talk to the restaurant or cafe owner for their idea of when a quieter part of lunch is for that particular establishment.
Often an earlier lunchtime reservation will guarantee you faster service and less noise.;
, To make it easier for people to reach the restaurant or cafe, make sure that it is in a centralised location that most, if not all, the business meeting attendees will find easier to reach.
 This will be a quieter location and if you set aside a good 45 minutes for this part of your meeting, you can probably get a lot of the talking done before moving to the table.


Use the remaining time at the table to share small talk, to get to know one another better, and to ensure that everyone actually has a good time, with good feelings all round.
 Find out whether there is a quiet room you can retreat to for the lunch, find out if it's possible to hurry food to meet people's need to get out on time, and find out if there are ways to cater for specific needs such as having to make calls or receive a courier, etc.


Check the menu in advance to be certain the food is good if you haven't tried the place before. You don't want any nasty surprises to spoil the atmosphere of the place.
 Set goals about what you want out of the meeting in advance, as well as the things you'd like to make known to the other party attending the business lunch.

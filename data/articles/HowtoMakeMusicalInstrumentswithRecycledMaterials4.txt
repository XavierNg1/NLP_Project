 Find four to six empty metal cans of various sizes and shapes. Make sure that the cans are clean and safe to use.


Some cans worth considering include soup cans, tuna cans, coffee cans, and pet food cans.
If the top edge of the can seems jagged, apply a layer of thick tape to the rim to prevent any accidental cuts.
 Stand a can upside-down and place a thick nail in the bottom center. Use a hammer to puncture the bottom of the can with the nail.


This step should be performed with adult supervision.
Repeat this procedure with each can.
 String a long piece of yarn through the hole in one of your cans. Repeat for each can, using a different piece of yarn each time.


Use yarn, cord, or another type of thick string for this part of the process.
There should be about 8 inches (20 cm) of string sticking out of the flat top of the tallest can. The rest of the lengths can vary, but the cans will need to be able to bump into each other as they hang.
 Tie a metal washer onto the end of the yarn sticking through to the inside of the can.


You could use another object, like a rock, if washers are not available. The object should be heavy, though, so that it can create additional noise when it hits the side of the can.
 Knot the other end of each string to the bottom of a sturdy clothes hanger.


The cans should overlap each other as they hang.
 Place the chimes in a windy area and let the breeze play them for you, or strike the chimes with a chopstick to play them yourself.

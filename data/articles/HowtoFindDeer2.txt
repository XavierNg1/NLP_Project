 If there is moisture or snow on the ground, this will make it easier to locate tracks. Deer tracks are easiest to spot in snow or soft dirt/mud that is malleable to the touch and will reposition into a track when an animal steps on it.
 When you find deer tracks, you can use them as evidence to help you determine how many deer were present and how big they were. Deer tracks have two “toes” and a marking at the base of the track. Deer have cloven hooves which means they're split down the middle. Deer tracks normally look like the image below. Generally, the bigger the track, the bigger the deer.


Remember, if you see larger tracks accompanied by small tracks, you may be following a doe with a fawn. You do not want to kill a mother deer as this will orphan the fawn.
 If the tracks seem frozen over or are messed up by other tracks, they are most likely old. If there has been a recent snow and there are uncovered tracks in it, they are probably new.

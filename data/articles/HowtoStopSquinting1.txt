 If you’re squinting even though there is adequate light without being overpowering, chances are there is something wrong with your vision. If it's been more than one or two years since your last eye exam, then it’s time to get a new one. Eye exams may not be free depending on where you live so consult your Doctor, family or friends as they may have recommendations.


Depending on your insurance, you may be covered for eye care as new glasses can set you back upwards of $500; however, there are also lower cost online distributors who will send low-cost glasses straight to your home after you send them your prescription. Ask your eye care specialist what options are available at your location.;
, Check your ego at the door and always use your glasses or contacts as prescribed to you. It’s easy to get lazy or vain and avoid having to wear them. Choose a pair of glasses that suit your style and facial structure and keep them close by so that straining (and squinting) is minimized.


Consider a bifocal lens if you find you are constantly wearing and removing glasses for different situations but consult an optometrist before doing so.
 If you squint because of difficulty focusing, move closer to or further away from the subject whenever possible. For example, ask to sit in the front of the classroom or boardroom if it will help you focus. You can also reserve your seat or come early to a movie or play if you know what row you need to be at for optimum viewing.

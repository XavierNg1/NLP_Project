 Betta fish come in many different colors, and the color can look different when it shimmers in the light. Take some time to notice all of the different hues of your betta’s scales.Names like Rainbow, Coral, or Shimmer could be good names.
Try using different languages to describe the colors. A name like Rûng, the Thai word for rainbow, would be great since betta fish are are also called siamese fighting fish.
Try putting the fish bowl near a window to see what your fish looks like in sunlight.
 Each individual fish is unique, so their behavior will be slightly different. Some fish might swim quickly around the bowl, or dart back and forth, but others may swim very calmly, or just float in one place for a while.


The swimming pattern of your fish can help you give it a name to match its personality. Names like Speedy, Slowpoke, Zipper, or Turtle could work.
 Sometimes, looking at where your fish likes to stay or sleep can help you come up with a name.


Does your fish hide in the leaves of a plant? You could name it Heidi.
Is your fish always resting at the bottom of the bowl? A name like Lazy Bones or Droopy would be appropriate.

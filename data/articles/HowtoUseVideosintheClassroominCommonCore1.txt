  Videos are appropriate in some lessons, and not others.  


You may choose videos for a part of a lecture because you already know there is high quality, interesting content.  
You may find students not engaged in a part of a lesson because the material is dry; in this case, showing them videos could help.
Many teachers who are piloting Flipped Classrooms and/or Blended Learning find videos particularly appropriate.;
,  Check with your peers, or simply look online.  There is an abundance of videos, and the issue may be finding the right one. If you are looking for younger kids, you will find a lot of good material at PBS Learning Media.  National Geographic is good for science, and code.org for programming.


You may find it easier to look on a site that has videos from different publishers, like OpenEd or Edutopia.  They make it easier to browse if you don't know where to look.
  Common Core encourages use of new material like videos, but you want to see if the video you chose is Common Core aligned to the class you are teaching.


Videos and other teaching material are labeled so you can easily find them. For example,if you are looking for Common Core, English Language Arts, Literacy for Kindergarten, you will see the resource labeled like this: CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.K.1

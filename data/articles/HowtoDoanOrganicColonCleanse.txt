 Abstaining from food for a short period of time will speed the process of releasing fat-stored chemicals, drugs and other toxins from your body. A 2 day fast is sufficient.

Prepare for your fast by eating nothing but fresh, organic fruits and vegetables for 2 days. Avoid all dairy products; they produce excess mucous in the colon. During these 2 days before your fast, take 1 capsule of fiber (ground flaxseeds or psyllium seeds) 4 times daily. Fiber will help form bulk and sweep the colon through the large intestine. Do not take a fiber supplement during the 2 days of your fast.



 


Consume at least 8 glasses of water on each day of the fast.






Drink a variety of fresh, organic vegetable and fruit juices each day. Add the juice from 1 organic lemon to a glass of warm water and drink it as soon as you awaken. Throughout the day, drink fresh organic juices such as apple, beet, cabbage, carrot and celery. Cabbage juice is particularly good for colon problems.






Drink 2 cups of herbal tea each day. Pau dâ€™arco and slippery elm are both beneficial in cleansing the colon.

, On the morning of the third day, eat very small amounts of organic watermelon, banana or natural, unsweetened applesauce. Continue to eat small amounts of these foods throughout the day.

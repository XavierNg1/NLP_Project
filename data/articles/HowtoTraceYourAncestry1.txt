 Find out as much as you can about your family history. Look through old photo albums, and ask your family members what they know. Ask for the names of grandparents, great-grandparents, and other relatives, as far back as they can remember. Determine the names, locations, and timelines of the ancestors you want to know about.


Make sure to get the exact spelling. Learn about any spelling changes that may have taken place over the years. Perhaps your ancestors changed their names when they moved to a new country or community.
Family members can be the simplest way to the past. Do not assume that your parents, grandparents, and other relatives have already told you everything that they know. Older relatives may remember further back.;
, Find out whether your family has done any genealogy research before. Look for any existing (online or physical) documents that tell about your family. Also, look for pictures that can give you a sense of what life was like back when the photo was taken. Look for family trees, records, and research projects that might give you a solid starting point.

 As of 2016, only estates larger than $5.43 million owe federal estate tax.This amount will increase each year in line with inflation, and does not include any property left to a surviving spouse or a tax-exempt charity.
More than 99 percent of all estates are not large enough to owe federal estate tax. The very large estates that do have to pay are taxed at a rate of 40 percent., If the estate must pay estate and gift tax, it is due nine months after the date of death.You may apply for a six-month extension provided you make your request before the due date and pay the estimated correct amount of tax.
 Depending on the assets of the estate, there are several different forms and schedules that may have to be filed to complete the estate and gift tax return.Generally, you must file Form 706, which reports on the estate itself. You also may have to file Form 709, on which you report certain transfers such as generation-skipping transfers and others subject to the federal gift tax.
 Because the estate and gift tax is complex and there is a lot of money at stake, bring on a professional such as a certified tax agent, CPA, or attorney to assist you with filling out and filing the forms.If the estate already has an accountant or attorney, he or she may be able to assist with filing federal estate and gift tax returns.
As the executor of the estate, you should have the power to hire professionals as needed to take care of financial or legal matters that are outside your area of expertise.
Any professional you hire would be paid out of the estate's assets, and his or her fees generally would be deductible on the estate's income tax return., Even if the estate isn't large enough to owe federal estate taxes, some states also impose separate estate taxes.Whether a separate state estate tax is due depends on where the deceased person lived or owned real property.While fewer than half of all states impose an estate tax, many of these states set the value of estates subject to the tax much lower than the federal limits. For example, estates in Massachusetts or Oregon that are worth $1 million or more must pay a separate state estate tax.

 Samples can be collected from the field or purchased. Alternatively, any jewelry or scraps of metal can also be analyzed. The sample will not be harmed by the spectrometer., Little preparation is needed to analyze a sample with ED-XRF spectrometry. The results are extremely accurate and cost very little compared to other methods. The spectrometer can examine samples that are solid, liquid, or powdered., ED-XRF spectrometry is short for Energy Dispersive - X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry. This technology identifies elements and compounds by the way that they disperse light. Results will show the percent composition of gold in your sample. From that, you can determine how much gold is present given the weight of the sample.For example, if you had a piece of jewelry that was 100 grams and had a 70% gold composition, the piece would contain 70 grams of gold.

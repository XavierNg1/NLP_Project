 In the top left corner, toggle open Search if it's not already open. When it is, you will see three buttons: Fly To, Find Business, and Directions. Click on Fly To.


Enter in your street address, and click the magnifying glass. Google Earth will rotate (more, or less depending on the state or country you've entered), and zoom in pretty quickly to your neighborhood as seen from a few thousand feet. There will be a gray crosshair over your house, next to your address.
 This is nice, but still a long way from what you want to see. Double click just outside of the gray crosshairs, and let's get closer.


Each double click brings you about halfway between where you were, and the ground.
Continue clicking until you are very close. That's usually about three double-clicks.
As you can see, it's a little blurry now. That's because the cameras that shoot the tops of houses are several miles up. They do a remarkable job despite that, but you were probably hoping for more.
 A set of controls will appear—–two virtual joysticks, one with a hand and one with an eye, and if Google has mapped your neighborhood, an orange human icon. Drag the icon to your house and release it. You will be placed on the ground, on your street!

, You can pan around, looking at your neighborhood—–you can even click on the street and "walk" along the road, anywhere Google has mapped!

 You can buy the console from Nintendo, or from any number of online stores. Enter 'Buy Nintendo DS' into an internet search and you will find a bunch of options to buy from. Prices range anywhere from $20.00 to $60.00 depending on if you are buying the console new, used, or refurbished.
 Some classic Nintendo series and characters include Donkey Kong, the Legend of Zelda, Mario Kart, Mario Party, and Mario World. If you have no idea what kind of game you want to play, starting with one of these could be a good bet. Everyone else seemed to like them and you might too!, Before you use the Nintendo DS for the first time, the battery must be fully charged. To do this, you'll want to find the power adapter in the package that your Nintendo DS came in. It should be labeled as the power adapter. Take the small end of the adapter and plug it into the plug at the back of your Nintendo DS labeled 5.2v ln. On the other end of the adapter, swing the prongs out of adapter until they lock into place. Now you can go ahead and insert the adapter into a normal 120 volt wall plug. Once the system begins to charge, an orange light will turn on. Once it is fully charged it will go off and that's how you will know you are ready to play.
Always unplug the adapter from the wall before unplugging it from the Nintendo DS.
Your battery is good for at least 500 full charges before it starts losing steam. Keep that in mind for future reference.

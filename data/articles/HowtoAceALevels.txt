 Write notes after each class, not during it. Pay the maximum amount of attention in class and maybe write down just a few headlines, then at home write detailed notes neatly on a separate notebook. Include diagrams and tables. If your school allows you to bring a cell phone to class, then record your teacher's lecture and write notes from it at home. This will allow you to pay more attention in class.;
, If you have already attended some classes, rewrite all the notes you have in a more organized way, adding in more information that you have learned since then. Remember, the more you know about a subject the better.
 Study all your subjects every day in small portions. This will help you to reconnect ideas you have previously learned, and helps with memorizing and understanding. After each weekly schedule has been completed, plan and write a new one for the following week. Only have 1 day a week as free time. Be strict and finish all your planned work!

, This will give you essential time to revise, practice past papers and answer additional questions.
, If you don't find it interesting, try to create interest by studying biographies about famous scientists.
 Change it when this happens.
 Keep your brain fresh and exercise.Remember "A healthy body possesses a healthy brain" and obviously, only a healthy brain can possibly ace Advanced level.
, Accept that it's normal and healthy and that it represents your concern.

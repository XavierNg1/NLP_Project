 Some abrasive cleaners are Comet, Barkeeper’s friend, or simple baking soda.These are all powdered cleaners that can be sprinkled on a surface area.
 It is easiest to wet the glass first, then apply the powder to it. This way, the powder will stick to the surface of the glass. The water and the abrasive will work together to make a sort of cleaning paste.
 Many purpose-made powder cleaners have multiple holes in the top that facilitate sprinkling. If yours doesn’t, or if you’re using baking soda, you could try putting the powder in a small sifter and sprinkling it on the surface with that.
 Think of it as a double benefit: cleaning and a workout at one time!








, While some cleaning products can be left on the glass, an abrasive cleaner is likely to leave a residue since it isn’t designed specifically as a glass cleaner. Thoroughly rinsing the cleaner away with water, then cleaning the glass with a traditional glass cleaner is the best way to ensure that the abrasive cleaner does not leave any residue.
 After you rinse away the cleaner and clean the glass with water or glass cleaner, be sure that you dry the surface thoroughly to prevent additional water spots.
 An alternate approach to using an abrasive cleaner is to use an abrasive scrubber. The scrubber essentially works like very fine sandpaper to remove stains and build-up from the glass. Some popular abrasive scrubbers are steel wool,rough green scrub sponges, and a product known as a magic eraser, which is a very fine sponge.

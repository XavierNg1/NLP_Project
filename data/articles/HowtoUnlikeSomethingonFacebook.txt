 So you're sick of a certain page's annoying posts constantly showing up in your newsfeed? Get rid of them! All you need to do is:


Click on the button that says "Liked" in the top right-hand corner.
You will be given the option to "Unlike". Click on it.
Congratulations! You no longer like the page, so their posts will no longer show up on your newsfeed.;
, Alternatively, you can unlike a page from your own profile. This method requires a few more steps, but you will be able to unlike multiple previously liked pages at the same time, which is great if you're planning on doing a mass clear-out. All you need to do is:


Go to your own profile page and click on the button that says "More" in the right-hand corner, under your cover photo.
Scroll down to the "Likes" option (it should be the sixth one down) and click on it.
This will bring you to a page displaying all of your previous likes, broken down into categories such as Books, TV programmes, Films etc.
Simply scroll over the image of the item you wish to unlike. A "Liked" box will appear, which you can click on.
Once you click on the "Liked" box, an "Unlike" option will appear. Click on it.
Scroll over the next item you wish to unlike and do the same. Happy unliking!

, Accidentally like a picture or comment while you were stalking someone on Facebook? Don't worry, it happens to everyone. Luckily, the mistake is easy to correct.


You see, after you have clicked the “Like” link underneath a post, comment, picture or whatever, the link will automatically change to “Unlike”, making it easy for you to reverse the like.
So just go to the post you want to unlike and look for the "Unlike" link directly beneath the content.
 Obviously, all you need to do now is click on the "Unlike" link to reverse the like and avoid any potentially embarrassment. Your secret's safe with us.

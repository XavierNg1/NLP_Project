 Although there are lots of apps that require a purchase, there are thousands of apps available for download that are completely free. These apps may be free versions of paid apps with ads, or they may be completely free with no strings attached.
 You will need to have a valid Apple ID in order to download free apps. You can create an Apple ID without a credit card by following this guide.
 There will be a variety of categories and featured apps to choose from on the main App Store page. You can use the categories to find apps that interest you, or you can search for specific apps using the Search bar. Free apps will say "Free" in the Price section of the App description.
 When you find the app you want, tap it to open a new window with all of the app details. Here you can see if the game is appropriate for whoever is using the device, and whether or not you can buy things from within the app.


If the app offers purchases from within the app, there will be a small notice underneath the company name that says "Offers In-App Purchases". Oftentimes this means that the full functionality of the app will require a purchase through the app.
 This will change the button to an "INSTALL" button.
 If your Apple ID is set to ask for passwords, you will need to enter the password before the app starts installing. The app will begin downloading and installing. When the app is finished installing, it will appear on your Home screen.


If your device is set to only download over Wi-Fi, you may need to wait until you're connected to a network for the download to start.

 If you only get on once every month you will miss out on a lot of exclusive and limited offers. Keep an eye out to see posts from your friends on Farmville, they might be giving away an animal or money. You will also get a lot more money from planting and harvesting crops, trees, and animals.;
, Ask neighbors if they will send you a certain animal that you need. Put the animals in rows once you have a lot.
 Plants are the most profitable thing possible on Farmville. Get at least 15 land plots and plant anything. Plant raspberries and strawberries during the daytime because they grow quickly and you can harvest them fast. Right before you go to sleep, plant something that is 8 to 12 hours (depending how long you sleep) and harvest in the morning. It helps to have a sheet of paper that you write down what you planted and when you need to harvest it so they don't wither.
 Usually during the holidays, Farmville will have special gifts you can send to your friends. So far, on Christmas you could send gift boxes and you could open them. There were actually really nice exclusive things that sometimes came from the boxes. I once got a gingerbread house from the free gifts. On Valentine's Day, you could send 'Valentines' to your friends, and you built up a certain number then traded it in for a rare item. Hang around Farmville a little more often during the holidays.
 Send some to your neighbors, they might send you one back. They have trees, the common animals (cows, chickens, pigs, etc.) and decorations. If you really need free gifts, you can make another Facebook, add yourself as a friend and send yourself gifts.

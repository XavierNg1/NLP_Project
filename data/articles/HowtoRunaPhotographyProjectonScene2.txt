 It's the day of the shoot. You've arrived early to scout the location real quick, just in case something is different or something needs to be changed quickly. Before your model arrives, if they aren't early themselves, set up your equipment. If you have any extra lighting equipment or backdrops needed to be place, make sure those are done. Set your exposure on you camera and fire off a few test shots.
 The time has finally come. All of your planning has come to this moment. When everything is the way you want it, it is time to shoot. When working with a person, it is nice to talk with them, make sure they are comfortable and relaxed. This is the fun part, so move around and even if you think you got your shot, take more. Get every angel and every pose you can think of and then make some up.

 This brings you to the program menu. Using the arrow keys, move over to NEW and hit .;
, Depending on what equation you enter, you can name it after the equation, or you can call it whatever you want, but it can only use numbers and symbols and can only be 8 characters long. So, let's say you want to enter the formula for the area of any triangle. Its real name is Heron's Formula. So type in HERON or HERONS. I don't recommend TRIANGLE because there are so many triangle formulas out there.
 This is an entry. Each entry tells the calculator what to do.
 Hero's formula asks for the three sides of the triangle. The sides will be stored as the variables A,B,C. These can change each time, so you have to tell the calculator what it is. In order to do that you would need to use the prompt command. Hit again. Move over to I/O (Input/Output) and move down to 2:Prompt. Hit . This takes you back to your creating screen.
 The "," key is right above the 7. Do not put a period after the list. Then hit .
 It says "sto>" for store. (It's right above your "ON" button) Hit . The store command will store the number to the variable.
 Continue to type "D(D-A)(D-B)(D-C)->E" and hit .
 Hit (which is E). Hit one last time. This will display the value of E.
 Exit the menu and go to again. Move to your program and hit enter. It will ask you for the prompts, and will display the answer at the end.

 Remember, the middle line will be where you'll be folding. make 3 rectangles that will be attached to the front of the pouch later. cut them. make 3 pockets on the pouch. you will fold the sides to the inside. then sew them.
 Use pins to hold them on. Start sewing. Make sure the 3 pockets are only on the front side of the pouch. Leave the back untouched. After sewing is finished, you can sew the two sides of the pouch. You can leave it open and next is to add the strap to tie around your waste. This will actually be tied around a bit lower of your right waist to the middle of left waist. Sew one end of strap on to one side of pouch, then do the same on the other side. Once it's complete. you're done!

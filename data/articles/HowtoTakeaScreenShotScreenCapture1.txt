 To take a screen capture of your entire monitor, press the Print Screen button. It may be abbreviated, and is typically located between the F12 key and the Screen Lock key. You may need to use the Function or Fn key if you are using a laptop.


The image will be copied to the clipboard. You will need to paste it into Paint or a document in order to see and edit the picture.;
, If you are using Windows 8, you can press the Windows key + Print Screen to save the screenshot directly to a file. This will save you from having to paste it into Paint first. The file is located in the Screenshots folder of your Pictures folder. The folder will be created if it does not yet exist.
 If you just need one of your windows in the screenshot, you can hold the Alt key while pressing the Print Screen button. This will take a screenshot of whatever window is currently active on your computer instead of your entire display.


You will still need to paste it before you can save the image.

 Do you want to use materials for the outdoors? Furniture in your house? This decision will greatly inform what type of fort you want to make. The great thing about a fort is that you can use anything you have available to make a cool little hang out space. Couches, beds, sheets and blankets are great options for fort materials inside. Branches, leaves, and even dirt can all be used as material outside.;
, You’ll want a lot of space so you can expand your fort as you see fit. Building a fort in a closet is a lot more difficult than in an open living room. Similarly, if you’re building outside you’ll need to find an appropriate area to build shelter. Look for places that aren’t in danger of being flooded or hit by falling trees. If you're making a fort outside, try to look for overhanging rocks to act for a roof, or 'Y' shaped trees to act as the center of your teepee. If a tree has fallen down and ripped up the roots behind it you can use the pocket where the roots used to be to set up a fort.


Closets and corners are good places to build inside.
 The size of your fort will determine where you build it and how many materials you need. Try not to be too aggressive with the size of your fort. You might lose interest. Try to decide ahead of time how many people you want to be able to fit into your fort. Do you want to be able to lie down in it? Stand up? Factor these decisions into the type of fort you make, and where. For example, if you want to be able to stand up in your teepee you'll have to find longer branches and a taller tree.
 Now it’s time to get going! Decide what kind of fort you want to make and find the materials to get started. Most forts are pretty simple to make, so this shouldn’t be too challenging. However, you might need to spend a good amount of time gathering blankets or card board boxes or branches. Spend some time gathering the appropriate materials before you start construction.

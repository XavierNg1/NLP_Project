 How difficult was the day for you? How often did you find that you wanted to speak? Was it uncomfortable? Relieving? Ask yourself why staying silent had any sort of emotional effect on you.Write down or record your experience. Consider keeping a journal or creating a voice recording of your experience. It may be nice to refer back to the experience in the future.
 Talk to your friends or family about your day. Let them know the impact it had on you and your outlook on life. Ask them how it felt when you were silent. They may also have interesting insights.If you were silent with a friend, debrief after the day is over. Have a conversation in which you compare and contrast your experiences. You will probably learn more about your unique qualities and your friendâ€™s inner world after the conversation.
 After investigating your relationship with speaking, and after talking with others, you may be able to analyze the success of your day. Maybe your purpose was simply to observe yourself, or maybe it was to reflect deeply on a social issue. Ask yourself if you fulfilled your original goal. If not, what could you do better next time?

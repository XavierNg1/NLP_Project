 If you have long hair, wring the water out of it with a twisting or squeezing motion. To do this, collect all your hair together and drape over one shoulder. Then grab your hair and twist it in order to help squeeze out any excess water and prevent dripping.


It is best to do this while still in the shower so that the water goes down the drain and does not make the bathroom floor wet and slippery.;
, Hold your hands at a right angle to the surfaces of your body and using the base of your palms as a squeegee. First run each hand along the opposite arm from top to bottom so that your arms won't drip on the rest of your body. Then proceed to dry your torso and legs in long, downward strokes, stopping occasionally to flick off the accumulated water on the hands.
 A robe can also be worn to help with drying off. It can work like a towel to help pat dry your skin. It is best to use a cotton or terry cloth robe because they are made from absorbent material and will help with the process of drying off. , Once you are no longer dripping wet it is best to leave the washroom. The hot air and humidity created from the shower will slow down the drying process and leave your skin moist for longer. By entering a cooler and less humid room you will dry faster. It is a good idea to have a few pieces of clothing to put on immediately after the shower so that you can comfortably exit the washroom quickly.
Clothes made from cotton are the most absorbent and can help you dry off quickly.

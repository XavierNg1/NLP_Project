 Bend back the pin so that you have a long piece of metal wire. This will be your pick, and is inserted into the lock and used to move the pins out of the way.

Strip off the rubber knobs on the ends, as they will only get in the way. You can do this with your teeth, or a pair of wire cutters if you have them.;
, Stick the pin into your lock roughly one centimeter. The flat side should be facing up. Push the rest of the pin to the left, bending the end of the pin slightly. It only needs to curl up a few millimeters.









You'll end up pushing the pin roughly 2 or 3 inches to the left to get the right bend.
 Take one end of your pick and bend half of it back on itself, creating a little loop. This is simply so that the pick is easier to hold and put pressure on.
 This is easiest with a pair of pliers, but you can do it with your fingers with a little persistence. The lever acts like the key-- turning the actual lock once you've moved the pins (which keep the lock secure) out of the way with your pick. You simply want the bent half off the pin (away from the rubber ends) to be at a right angle from the rest bottom of the pin.
 A typical lock is made up of two parts: the barrel and the pins. The barrel is the chamber you put the key into. The pins are small metal cylinders that sink into the barrel, holding it in place until a key (or your pick) pushes them up and out of the way. The pins are cut in half, and when the halfway mark lines up with the barrel you can turn the lock. Your job, as a lock picker, is to manually push up each of the pins into the correct position, slowly turning the barrel so that they can't call back into place. Once you've got all the pins out of the way, the barrel will turn freely and the door will be open.









A key is basically a complex pick. The groves are tuned so that, once inserted, all the pins are perfectly aligned and you can turn the doorknob.

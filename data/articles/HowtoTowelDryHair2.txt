 A towel wrap is a good system to use if you have very long hair that tends to hold onto moisture for a long time. You can wrap up your hair while you’re getting ready for the day, then take it down and style it when it’s still a little damp. You’ll need a large, soft towel long enough to wrap your hair.


You can buy special towels made just for this purpose. Check out a beauty supply store or look online for a good selection.
 Right when you turn off the shower, use your hands to gently squeeze water from your hair. Don’t wring it out, but just squeeze it lightly to remove the streams of water that will drip down. This way your hair will dry faster.
 Make sure all of your hair is hanging straight down, and use your hands to finger-comb it into place. Position the towel horizontally across the back of your head, so that the bottom of the towel is aligned with the bottom of your hairline.


Make sure all of your hair is hanging in the same direction, so it’ll get wrapped up nicely in the towel. If some of your hair is folded back in a random direction it could end up messing up your style when it dries.
 While you’re still bent over, use your hands to gather your hair into the towel so that the sides of the towel meet in the middle of your forehead. It should look as though you have a long top ponytail covered by a towel.
 Starting right next to your forehead, use your hands to twist the towel in one direction. Your hair and the two sides of the towel should all be part of the twist. When you’ve twisted the towel to the very end, put the end of the twist on top of your head.


Don’t twist too hard, since this could pull at your hair. Twist just tightly enough so that the twist stays in place.
You can hold the end of the twist in place with a hair clip.
 The towel will absorb the moisture in your hair during this time. It’s a gentle way to dry long hair. When you’re ready, remove the towel and style your slightly damp hair.

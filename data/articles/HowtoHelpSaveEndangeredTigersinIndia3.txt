 Follow conservation practices when you go on tourism trips in India, especially in relation to the forest habitat of tigers. This is true for both local and international tourists. Don’t take vegetation out of the forests and don’t use destructive vehicles to get around inside them.


Instead, if you’re booking safari trip in India, make sure the company you purchase a package with actively supports tiger conservation. If you don’t see it on the packaging or website, ask about it.
 If you use Chinese medicine, you are probably consuming tiger parts. Unless a product you’ve purchased says it is an herbal remedy, a Chinese medicine product probably has tiger parts in it, depending on what it’s for. Switch over to herbal medicines so that you aren’t part of the problem.


For example, tiger bones are used in Chinese medicine to treat a host of aches and pains. An herbal alternative to, say, a headache, is spring onion tea or wild ginger., If you ever hear a rumor of poaching activity in India, whether in your community or while doing any relief work, report it to wildlife conservers or the authorities immediately.


You might hear a poaching rumor if you are working as a volunteer in an Indian village.
 Since the tiger’s habitat is in the forest, consumer purchase of lumber and paper products places pressure on it.Try to find avoid purchasing wood products made or sourced in India if you live abroad, and find alternative materials for these items if you live in India.


The next time you purchase a ream of paper or a piece of wooden furniture, ask the manufacturer the source of their wood before purchasing.

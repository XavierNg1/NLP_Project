 Mix together the spices and 3 tbsp. of olive oil and rub the chicken in the spices to improve its flavor. Let the chicken soak in the marinade for at least one hour in the refrigerator before you begin to fry it. The longer you leave the chicken in the marinade, the deeper the color and flavor will penetrate the chicken., Add at least 2 tbsp. of olive oil to the pan, just enough to thinly coat the bottom of the pan. Wait until the oil is sizzling, which should take about 1-2 minutes.
 Fry the chicken until the bottom has darkened and begun to turn crispy and brown.
 Cook the chicken on its other side until it's the same color and consistency as the first side of the chicken. To check that it's done, you can cut into the thickest part of the drumstick. The juices should run clear and the meat should be opaque throughout -- not pink.
 Place it on a plate for at least 10 minutes until it has cooled down.
 Enjoy this tasty chicken while it's hot. You can eat it on its own or pair it with a nice portion of veggies and potatoes.

 If asking your friend point-blank about the issue isn't an option, visiting their Facebook profile is the next best thing.;
, This is usually indicative of a gap between private posts and public posts. If you've been restricted, you won't be able to see the private posts, hence the space here.Depending on when your friend made their public posts, you might not see a gap here even if you have been restricted.
 These will likely appear below the empty space if there is any. If there's a "Public" globe to the right of every post's timestamp, you know that you aren't seeing their private posts.


This doesn't necessarily mean they've restricted you--they may have simply decided to post only public items.
 Not being able to see photos or other content that you could before might mean you've been restricted.


It also might mean that your friend simply deleted their posts.
 Even if you can't see private posts or their old photos, your friend may have just deleted their old information and locked down their account to retain privacy from all of their Facebook friends (not just you). You can verify this by having a mutual friend look at your friend's Timeline and tell you if they see anything that you don't.


Even just asking them if your friend has posted recently when you can't see any account activity from the past month or so will accomplish this goal.
 There is always a possibility that the action was performed in error, since the "Restricted" list is in close proximity to the custom list section.

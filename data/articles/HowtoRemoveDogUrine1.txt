 Place a thick layer of paper towels and newspapers on the soiled area. Press or stand on the paper for a few minutes, allowing the liquid to be pulled out of the carpet.After you’ve soaked up as much urine as possible, leave the soiled papers in your dog’s bathroom area. For example, place the papers right outside in an area of your yard that your dog normally urinates. This will reinforce the expectation of their bathroom habits.;
, Fill up a drinking glass with water. Pour a quarter of the water on the area at a time. Allow each pour of water to seep into the carpet before pouring more.
 Evenly disperse the drops throughout the wet area.
 Do not reuse any paper towels from earlier in the process. Doing so will replace the urine you’ve already removed from the area.
 To create the mixture, mix 2 cups of warm water, 2 cups white vinegar, and four tablespoons of baking soda into a spray bottle or bowl and disperse on the wet area. Let it sit for five minutes., This will remove excess water from the fabric and prevent mold from forming underneath it. Blot the area until the area is only slightly damp.
 Excess water from the process will be left either way, but using a vacuum or hair dryer to remove more water will speed up the drying process.

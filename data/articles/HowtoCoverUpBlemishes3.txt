 This may sound counteractive, but if the blemish is large enough that it casts a shadow, you should counteract it by creating an optical illusion. Do this by using a highlighting concealer under the blemish. Your next layers of makeup will continue to reduce the visibility of the blemish while allowing the light to bounce off of the highlighter. This illusion will take away from the severity of depth in your blemish.
 A masking cosmetic is makeup that is thicker than concealer. It has added pigment as well. If youâ€™re trying to hide scars or other prominent blemishes, use a masking cosmetic as your concealer.
 When covering more prominent blemishes, a finishing spray is great. It will help keep your blemish concealed. Your finishing spray should go on directly after you finish covering your blemish. Apply your eye makeup and lip color after your spray.If you have smaller blemishes, a finishing spray is not necessary, but you may choose to use one.

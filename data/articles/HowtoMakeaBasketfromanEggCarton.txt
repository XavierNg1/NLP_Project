 While plastic ones probably could be used, they're liable to split when cut and be more fiddly, so this article is focusing on the cardboard ones. Any color is fine––if you've been collecting them and have a variety of colors, you might like to use a few different ones to liven up the baskets.;
, Cut as many cups as baskets you'd like to make. Cut with care, to maintain scallops around the top of the cup.
 Cut circles from the lid of the egg carton. The circle should be the same diameter of the top (open part) of the cup.
 This will balance the basket, ensuring that it doesn't topple over. Only proceed to the next step when the glue has dried. (It helps to press down on the circle, placing your finger into the base of the carton cup.)

Pierce two holes either side of the cup, just down a little from the top of the cup, at even heights.
Push one pipe cleaner end through one hole and loop around to keep in place.
Push the other end into the other hole, again making a loop to keep it in place. The handle should now form an arc over the top of the carton cup, serving as the basket's handle. It's now a miniature basket.
 If you need to cut it, do so, but account for the edges to make sure they stay looking pretty. If using fabric instead, it's a good idea to edge the fabric with pinking shears, to ensure a pretty final look.
 This doily should make a border around the outside of the circle, wider than the basket.
 Glue or staple on artificial flowers and leaves to complete the basket. Arrange them so that they are to the side, and not in the way of putting things into the basket.


If you'd like, tie a ribbon bow in the middle of the handle, at the top.
Markers can be used to decorate the sides of the basket. Draw small flowers, ladybugs, birds, etc., to enhance the basket's appearance.
 It can contain all manner of small items, from miniature chocolate eggs, seeds, beads, tiny pencils, little dolls, candies, jewelry, and more.

 The night before you make your kissing ball, soak your sprigs of mistletoe overnight. Place the stems down in a jar or vase of water. This will help them stay green and fresh looking for your display.During the holiday season, you should be able to find mistletoe at your local home and garden store.
 To create a “mini” kissing ball, trim your mistletoe sprigs using scissors or gardening shears. Instead of using whole sprigs, trim and separate sprigs to the desired length. In the end, you will want pieces of mistletoe that are roughly half the size of normal sprigs.


A normal kissing ball has pieces that are about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) in size., Take a two-inch (5 cm) floral foam ball and stick the stems of the sprigs in it. To get the sprigs inserted into the ball, you may need to use a metal skewer or ice pick to poke starter holes in the foam. Insert the sprigs until you cover the ball in mistletoe.Before you insert the sprigs, you may want to soak the foam ball in water for 15 minutes. This will help soften it up.
You can find floral foam at your local florist or arts and crafts store.
 Take about a foot (30.5 cm) of ribbon and tie it around the ball, creating a bow on the top. Then take a piece of wire, about 8 inches (20 cm), and insert it halfway into the ball. There should be at least 4 inches (10 cm) of wire sticking out of the top. Create a U-shaped bend in the remaining wire to create a hook from which to hang your ball.Because mistletoe berries are poisonous, make sure to hang your mini kissing ball in a place where children and pets will not ingest the berries.

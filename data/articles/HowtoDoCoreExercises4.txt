 The locust pose requires you to lift your chest and feet up off of the ground, using your core to stabilize your body. To give yourself added support, place your hands beneath your thighs with you palms facing upward. Use your fingers to push your legs up off of the floor until you become strong enough to keep your legs up without the added support.
 This yoga pose lifts your back and heels off of the ground, relying on your core to keep you stable and balanced. If you have difficulty lifting your feet, then wrap a strap around your arches and pull on the strap as you lift your back off of the ground. You can also have a partner press against your back so that your shoulder blades have something to push against as you raise your sternum.
 This exercise requires you to support your weight with your hands, but you actually use the core muscles to keep your body aligned as it lifts off of the ground. If you’re having difficulty keeping your elbows tucked in, then you can bind them together with a strap so that they better support your weight. You can also support your forehead or your ankles on a block or a cushion.
 Make sure that you have warmed up your core muscles before you perform this pose as it places a strong demand on your abdominals and lower back. If your hip isn’t strong enough to support your weight, then place some blocks under your shoulders and lean your extended leg against a wall to support your weight.
 In addition to strengthening both your core and your arms, the table pose provides a great stretch for the front of your body. This pose restores balance to your body after sports that require forward motion, like tennis or swimming. It also counteracts the effects of a day spent hunched over a computer at work.

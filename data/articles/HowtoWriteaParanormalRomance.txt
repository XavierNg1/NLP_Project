 This will give you an understanding for what you're writing about. In a paranormal romance, the creature is usually the male that the human female falls in love with. Don't be afraid to change this!;
, Give them a real personality, nobody likes a perfect character. Give them their flaws and habits. Give them unique traits and names. Especially the monster/creature/inhuman character. Remember the specific legends and traits your character already has behind them. (A vampire has to drink blood, a werewolf has to transform, etc.)

, What is your idea? How is do the characters meet, fall in love, and end up? What happens in between? Think about this as this is what makes up your story.
 Write your first draft, it can be as sloppy and weird as you want! Let the writing flow, unfiltered, from your pen to the paper or from your fingers to the keyboard.
 Really make the reader feel what's happening. A sentence like "She walked away from him." could become "With a toss of her auburn ponytail, she turned and stalked away, leaving him dazed and confused." See the difference?

, Make sure there are no spelling mistakes and that it all makes some sense before you move on to.
 Expect a couple of No's before you get published. But don't let it discourage you! If you get more than three No's, make some changes, like a different character or you might even swamp half the story line, and try again!

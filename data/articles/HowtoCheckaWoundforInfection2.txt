 This discharge may also have a foul odour. If you see pus or a cloudy fluid, draining away from the wound this is a big indicator of an infection.You should get medical care as soon as possible.


Some drainage from a wound is normal, as long as the fluid is thin and clear. Bacteria may create clear drainage that is not yellow or green. In this a case, your doctor may examine the fluid to determine a specific cause of infection., If you notice pus forming beneath the skin, around the wound site, you may have an infection.Even if you can see a build-up of pus, or feel a tender, growing lump under the skin, but it is not leaking out of the wound, this can still be a sign of infection and should be taken seriously., If there's no sign of infection, this will cover and protect the wound. If there are signs of infection, a sterile bandage will protect the wound from further contamination until you can see a doctor.Take care to only apply the nonstick part of the bandage to the actual wound. The bandage should be large enough to easily cover the wound.
 Some drainage may be normal from a wound as your body fights infection. But, if the pus becomes yellow or green and increases in amount (or refuses to subside), consider seeing your doctor. This is especially true if many previously discussed signs of infection are also present.

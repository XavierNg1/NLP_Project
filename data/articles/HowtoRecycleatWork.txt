 Informing employees of the significance of recycling and offering some recycling tips may motivate them to take part in the effort.;
, Post notices in appropriate locations informing employees of the various items they should be recycling, such as paper, cardboard, toner cartridges, soda bottles and aluminum cans.
 Ask that employees print on both sides of the copy paper and that the back side of used documents be reused as scrap paper. Purchase lighter stock with higher recycled content, and opt for re-manufactured cartridges.
 If you want to promote recycling at work, you need to lead by example. Therefore, post employee notices online or email notices directly to employees. Instead of printing brochures, newsletters, and policy manuals, send them out as .pdf files so that employees can print them only if they want to.
 Arrange for recycle bins for various materials to be delivered to your work. Accommodate the recycling needs of your particular business, including plain paper, cardboard, glass and plastic. Make sure that they are placed around your work area in locations that are convenient. If you want more people to recycle, you have to make it an option whenever you can.
 Arrange to have the shredder emptied on a regular basis. Depending on what you are shredding, consider using the shredded paper as packing material.
 Oftentimes, magazine companies will send more than 1 copy of a particular trade magazine. If you want the magazine but don't need 6 copies, call the company, and ask that they send just 1 copy. Recycle whatever comes in, in the meantime.
 Or ask that employees bring in their own. Opt for recycled napkins, compostable paper plates, and corn cups at office functions.

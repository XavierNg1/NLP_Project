 If you're new to the farm, you may not know of the problems until something happens. Ask when purchasing the property and do a thorough check upon purchase to find any such hazards. If there are any, take appropriate measures to guard against them. Such examples include:

Holes in the ground. From old mines to pits dug to dispose of dead livestock, holes in the ground can be a hazard especially if they have been covered and collapse in.
Garbage tossed into dams and other water bodies. The junk in the water might not be obvious until a boat or swimmer gets snagged on it. Worse still, there may be chemicals leaching into the water that are contaminating it.
Ruins of buildings. They might look romantic but they're lack of upkeep makes them potentially hazardous to all who wander near them.
Garbage tips filled with old chemical containers.
 Remove hazards that can be removed, such as demolishing unstable buildings and walls, disposing of chemical containers (get hazardous waste expert advice), filling holes, etc. Fence off hazards that cannot be removed, such as holes in the ground too deep to fill. Warning signs can help alert people to stay away from dangers––include visual symbols too for those unable to read.

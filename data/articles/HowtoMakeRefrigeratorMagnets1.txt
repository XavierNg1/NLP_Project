 You can turn almost anything you want into a magnet. Look for something that is between 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) wide/tall and not too heavy. Make sure that the bottom or back of the object is flat. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Legos
Small stones
Seashells and starfish
Large rhinestones
Small, plastic animals
Colorful buttonsBroochesScrapbooking embellishments (plastic flowers, cabochons, etc);
, You should not be able to see the magnet from behind your object. You can use a round button magnet. You can also cut a rectangle out of a thin, magnetic sheet. Keep in mind that the flat, sheet magnets tend to be weaker than the thicker, button magnets. It is best to save those weaker magnets for light objects.


If your object is large, consider gluing two small button magnets to the back: one at the top, and one at the bottom.
 If your object is very dirty, the glue may not stick to it. Simply soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol, and wipe the back of the object with it.
 The entire top surface of the magnet should be coated with glue. You can use hot glue or an industrial strength glue. Hot glue will be suitable for items made out of wood, foam, paper, and lightweight plastic. An industrial strength glue will be best for heavier objects, and anything made from plastic, metal, or glass.


Even if the magnet has a sticky back, it might be a good idea to use some glue. The adhesives on these types of magnets usually are not very strong or long-lasting.
 Press it down firmly enough so that the item sticks to the glue, but not so firmly that the glue gushes out all over the place.
 This can take anywhere from a couple of minutes to several hours. For example, hot glue will set within minutes, but an industrial strength glue may require up to a day in order to cure properly. If you are using an industrial strength glue, double-check the label to see how much time you need for it to dry and cure.

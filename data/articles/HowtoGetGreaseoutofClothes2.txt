 Use your fingers, or for thicker fabric, an old soft-bristled toothbrush. Make sure the grease spot is thoroughly soaked in soap.









Laundry detergent should also work for most stains.













Whatever soap you use should be colorless, just in case your fabric would be susceptible to a dye.
 Fill your sink, a bucket, or another container with hot water. Completely submerge your garment in the water, making especially sure that the grease-stained part is underwater.









Read your garment's care instructions if you need to double check that hot water won't cause it to fray or shrink. Use warm water if the tag instructs you to do so. If the tag instructs you to only use cold water, skip this step.













If you're concerned about completely submerging your clothing in hot water, try submerging only the spot with the grease stain. If the grease stain is just on a sleeve or one corner of the garment, weigh that part down with a stone or another heavy waterproof item to keep it underwater.
 Place the part with the grease stain under room temperature running water.









Examine the part of your clothing that was stained. Is the stain still there? If so, you'll need to continue treating it.













If the stain seems to be gone, you may hang your article of clothing to dry, or place it in the dryer.

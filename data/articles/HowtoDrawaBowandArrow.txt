 Make a curve that bends upwards on the tip; it should look something like a handle. Then add two rectangles on top of the peak of the curve. This will make the grip of the bow.






;
, Add a very slim rectangle next to it--this will be the body of the arrow.
 They should all be concentrated at one end, with three on each side.
 Make it isosceles and relatively thin, pointing downward as seen.
 Use a color you like for the bow.You can make the grip of a different color. Remember the tip of the arrow should look like metal, so use silver or grey.

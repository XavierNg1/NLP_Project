 The curve in the guitar's body will rest on your thigh, with the neck extending out to your left. Of course, left-handed guitarists would reverse, holding the guitar on their left leg. Sit up straight and hold the guitar close to your body, resting it on your thighs, hip, and stomach.

, It may feel more comfortable to lean the guitar back, but keeping it upright will help you play more quickly and comfortably. The body of the guitar should stay flush to the leg it rests on.









Resist the temptation to angle the guitar so you can see your hands -- this just makes it harder to play.
 For now, don't even worry about the note names. Just remember that guitar strings count up. The thinnest, lowest string is the first string, while the thickest, heaviest string on top is the sixth string.









If you're curious, the notes of the strings are, from 1st-6th, e-B-G-D-A-E.
 The frets are your key navigation tool on the guitar, and they correspond to different notes on each string. They are the little metal strips on the long, thin neck of the guitar. The first fret is the one farthest away from the body of your guitar. To play a note on the first fret, you put your finger down between the first fret and the head of the guitar.









If you're not holding a fret down on a string, then you are playing an open string.

You always play behind the fret -- if the song wants a note on the "10th fret," you'd put your finger between the 9th and 10th frets on the guitar, as close to the 10th as possible.

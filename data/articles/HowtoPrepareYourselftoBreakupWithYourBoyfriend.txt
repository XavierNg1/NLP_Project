 Come to terms with your own feelings and make a firm decision to end the relationship. Ask yourself: Is this really what I want? Do I really want to end a relationship with him? How can I do this without breaking his heart? Ask yourself these questions before you come to a conclusion.;
, Once you decide to break up with your partner, immediately think about how, when and where you will take action. Do you want it to be now? Tomorrow? Next month? Do you want to be break up with him at the park, your house, at school/work? Decide.
 Don't give a third party the opportunity to tell your partner that you want to break up before you have the chance to discuss the matter alone. That will ruin everything.
 Approach the topic when both of you are calm and rational. Don't announce your intention to break up during a heated argument or a moment of anger.
 Help your partner understand why you want to end the relationship. Be tactful, not brutal.

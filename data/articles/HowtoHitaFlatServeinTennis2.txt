 By holding it like this, you are able to more accurately control the toss. When you are setting up for a flat serve, you want to toss the ball in a simple, straight trajectory without any spin. This is most easily achieved when the ball is released from the finger tips, rather than the palm., This should be done by raising the arm straight, and releasing the ball from your fingertips when you are about head height. Because the ball will drop as you raise your racquet to hit it, you want to toss the ball a couple of feet higher than the place you intend to make contact with it. It should be tossed slightly in front of your body., An easy way to do this is by keeping your tossing arm raised during the serve. If you allow your arm to drop, it is easy to drop your head as well.Stay relaxed and focus on the serve, rather than glancing at your opponent or the net. Itâ€™s imperative to track the ball with your eyes the whole time!


This is a mistake that is most often made when a player is tense and nervous. As you practice your flat serve and gain confidence, you will more easily keep your eye on the ball the whole time.

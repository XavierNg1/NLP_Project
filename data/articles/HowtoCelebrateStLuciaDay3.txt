 It’s traditional in Swedish families for the oldest girl to dress as St. Lucia and wake her family at dawn on St. Lucia Day. She wears the same dress and wreath as the girl playing St. Lucia in the procession.

If you don’t already have the clothes, make sure you get these items ahead of St. Lucia Day--you’ll need them at dawn.
If there are no daughters in your family, there’s no reason why another family member can’t stand in as St. Lucia!, Swedish families traditionally eat lussekatter on the morning of St. Lucia Day. Lussekatter are cat-shaped saffron buns, but any bun or roll is also suitable. They are eaten with glögg or coffee. Make sure you have the food and drink ready to go before you go to bed!, The person playing St. Lucia should wake up the rest of the household at dawn to wish them a happy St. Lucia Day and to serve the traditional morning snack. Dawn represents the arrival of light in the winter darkness, so it’s important to get up early on St. Lucia Day., In Sweden, television stations show big St. Lucia processions and concerts on the morning of St. Lucia Day. If you aren’t in Sweden, you can look up videos online to recreate the experience in your own home.

 You can use leftover rice from last night's dinner, or you can make fresh rice. If you do not have any cooked rice on hand, you will have to make some now:In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water and ½ cup (115 grams) of rice.
Bring the rice and water to a boil.
Reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan, and simmer until the water has been absorbed, about 40 minutes.
Remove the saucepan from heat, and let the rice stand, covered, for 10 minutes.
 In a small bowl, combine ⅓ cup (85 grams) of bottled salsa, ½ cup (25 grams) of chopped, fresh cilantro, and ½ teaspoon dried oregano. Chop 3 large tomatoes, drain off any juices, and add them to the bowl. Toss the salsa mixture, then set it aside.


Make sure that you are using the smooth kind of bottled salsa, and not the chunky, "pico de gallo" kind.
 Pour the oil into a large skillet, and place the skillet onto the stove. Turn the heat up the medium, then add the onion and corn. Cook the onion and corn, stirring often with a wooden spoon or spatula, until the onion turns brown. This will take about 5 minutes., To prevent your salad from becoming too soggy, make sure that you drain all liquid from the tomatoes and the beans.
 This will prevent it from wilting the lettuce. If there is a lot of liquid in the skillet, it would be a good idea to drain it as well.
 Save the rest of the salsa dressing and shredded cheese for later.
 You can also add the tortilla chips directly into the salad, or you can keep them in a separate bowl. If the chips sit too long in the salad, they will become soggy; not everyone likes soggy chips.
 Keep the salsa and lime wedges in separate bowls, so that people can use as much as they like.

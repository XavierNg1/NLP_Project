 If you keep your quail together it is most likely that they all have mites and that their cage is infested with mites.


Quail with mites will have a decrease in egg production, they will be less active, and they will be feather plucking as you should know already.
 There are many treatments for mites, you can decide from chemical treatments to natural treatments. See below for a list of treatments:


Use products available in local stores such as mite spray or mite powder. Most pet shops and feed stores will supply poultry mite products and these can be the most effective.
Use permethrin. Permethrin is a safe insect killer used by many poultry owners and can also be sprayed in the quail’s cage to get rid of mite infestations.
Use garlic remedies. Garlic is said to be a good mite killer when put in homemade remedies such as a spray mix with 10 ounces of water, 1 ounce of garlic juice and 1 teaspoon of an essential oil.
 If the cage is infested with mites the quail will soon get infested with mites themselves. This is why you must clean the cage after treating the quail.


Spray permethrin in infested area. Quail usually infest cracks, bedding and feeders. Dispose of all the bedding and clean the feeder and water container. After that, hose the cage down and start scrubbing.
 Get a large tub and fill it to the brim with sand. Place the sand in the quail’s cage and make sure the quail have easy access to it. The quail should soon start to dust bathe.


Dust bathing prevents mites, it’s the quail’s way of cleaning itself. If you provide clean sand daily the quail shouldn’t get any more mites.

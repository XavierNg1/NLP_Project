 Anything one chooses to do is what is just right for them. But when it comes to do's and don'ts, many people throw out the ETIQUETTE word, or the word PROPER for what should not be done at all. i agree if one chooses to get married again that bachelor/bachelorette parties are a no-no, you're not bachelors! But when throwing a nice reception or even party for that matter i frown and get completely disappointed at the No gifts, or no registering for such! WHY NOT??;
,, When one is invited to a birthday, bridal, baby shower, or wedding, we all think hard on what to give our special friend or family member in celebration. we choose the perfect gift or what we hope will be the perfect gift. after all, we are spending our hard earned money on it and we want it to be valued and useful. Some of us Love the registry because it allows us to know exactly what is needed and helps to avoid duplicates. Many of us don't see the registry as a gift expectancy ploy but rather a suggestion of ideas. In this new society where technology rules, it's a blessing to have this resource for our show of appreciation.
 If they don't, many friends and family who will undoubtedly want to give a gift, a special gift for such a special occasion can do so with out the risk of giving something special that in turn will turn out to be 50 other peoples something special also.

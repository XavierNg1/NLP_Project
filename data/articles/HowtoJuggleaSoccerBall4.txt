 Doing this will keep your thigh flat. A flat surface is much easier to juggle off of then an angular surface.









Try to juggle with your thighs only after you have mastered juggling with your feet. Juggling with your thighs is a way to add versatility to your juggling skills. It will also allow you to keep the ball more in control.
 Let the ball drop onto the middle part of your thigh. If you bounce the ball off of your knee, it is almost guaranteed to go flying out of reach., Begin by bouncing the ball off your thigh and catching it. Repeat this process until you are able to control the direction of the ball and how high it goes with your thigh. Switch to the other thigh and repeat the process.
 Do this when you feel confident that you can control the ball with both thighs.
 Try kicking the ball with both feet and then both thighs. When you can do this without dropping the ball, try to bounce the ball off of each foot and thigh twice, then three times, and so on.

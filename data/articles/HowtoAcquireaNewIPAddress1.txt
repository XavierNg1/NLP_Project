 In order to know whether or not your IP address change is ultimately successful, you need to know your device's current IP address.
 This should be the computer, phone, or tablet whose IP address you wish to alter., This will essentially reset your Wi-Fi.

If your modem and router are comprised in the same unit, simply unplug the entire unit.
 This should be enough time for your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to provide your network with a new public IP address., It will begin lighting up. You'll want each light on the face of the modem to be on or flashing before you continue., After a couple of moments, the router's light will begin flashing, then turn constant., It should reconnect to the Internet once it finishes rebooting, though you may need to manually select a network and connect to it., You'll use the Internet browser of your choosing to view your new IP address., If the IP address listed here is different than the one you saw earlier, you have successfully changed your device's IP address.

If you don't see a different IP address, you may need to keep your router off for a longer period of time. Try turning it off for an entire night and then re-enabling it in the morning.

 Even though you may not be as physically strong as your aggressor, you probably have some kind of upper hand—whether that’s agility, compact size, or smarts, it depends on your situation. In any case, place yourself in a position where you have at least some kind of advantage.


Example: If you’re smaller, get some place where you’re difficult to reach (behind the bar, on top of the monkey bars, under or on the other side of the pool table). Distance will allow you to wear out your opponent and will keep you out of the way of any blows.
Example: If you can continue to talk your aggressor out of a situation, you should to do so. Use shame and try to get the crowd (if there is one) on your side—if your attacker knows that the crowd disapproves of their actions, the likelihood of an attack will decrease greatly.
 Whatever you do, be confident, and go a little crazy. If you don’t think you’re going to win the fight, who will? Also, feel free to make some noise. At the very least, it will throw off or annoy your opponent, and it will also draw attention to the situation—hopefully bringing in an authority figure.

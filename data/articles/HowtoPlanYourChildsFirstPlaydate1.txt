 Your child will likely not understand the concepts of good hosting unless you teach them. Explain that good hosting helps guests feel welcome. Playdates are more fun when everyone feels like they are wanted there.


Good hosting begins with greeting the guest at the door. It also involves sharing toys, food, and drinks, and including the guest in all activities. It may also mean not doing what your child wants to do, but doing what the guest wants, instead.;
, Children often have one or two items they don’t want others to play with. Put those toys in hiding to prevent any fights or hurt feelings at the playdate. The guest won’t be tempted to play with them if they aren’t in sight.


Have a talk with your child a few hours before the playdate to give them time to think about what they don’t want to share. This gives them a chance to decide what they really want to keep to themselves. Also, explain that these toys should be kept away. Tell your child they are fair game if they bring them out and that the guest will be allowed to play with them., Teach your child to be a properly-behaved guest before you drop them off at a playdate. This includes saying “please” and “thank you,” listening to the parent, and helping with cleanup. They should also understand that it is their friend’s home, so there may be different rules than at yours.


Talk to the parent after the date to get feedback on how it went. Consult with your child about the other parent’s concerns before the next date occurs to possibly prevent any issues from popping up next time.

 Your doll’s curls should be separated into individual strands, so you can grab each curl individually. If the curls aren’t clearly separated, grab a small section of hair near the doll’s face. 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm) of hair is perfect.
 Spray enough water so that the strand is wet, but not dripping. If your doll’s eyes aren’t covered, make sure that you don’t spray water into her eyes., First, look at the direction that the curl is going. Then, wrap the curl around your finger, a pencil, or a paintbrush in the same direction that the curl is already going. Hold it for 5-10 seconds, and then slide the object gently out of the curl.Pencils and paintbrushes work best for dolls with very curly hair. For hair that is slightly curly, your finger will work just fine.
 Move around the doll’s head, grabbing one curl at a time. For each curl, repeat the steps above. Once you have reached the other side of your doll’s head, her curls should be smooth and beautiful!

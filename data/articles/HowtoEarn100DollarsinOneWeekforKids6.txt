 If your parents, family members, or neighbors are having a garage sale, get in on it! Ask if you can have part of a table and have whatever money you make from the items you sell. Now the question: what are you willing to part with?


Don't try to sell your artwork, your dolls with one arm and one eye, or your Legos that you put into the blender. No one will buy them. Just look for things that are still in good condition but that you no longer use. Someone else could use and love them!

, There are several places that will take your things, put a price on them, and then give you most of the money when they sell. So gather up the things you don't need, ask Mom to take you, and head to the nearest consignment shop.


Consider selling some of your old things that you don't want anymore on eBay or a similar website. Have you been collecting anything that you have doubles of or don't want anymore?

, This one takes a little bit of know-how and creativity. But if you have those two things, why not give it a shot? Consider a couple of these ideas:


Can you make a mean cinnamon roll? Consider asking your neighbors if they'd like homemade cinnamon rolls delivered to their door on Sundays. People who live alone may love the treat, never bothering to bake for themselves!
Have a garden? Consider growing fruits or vegetables.
Are you good at woodworking, sewing, or crafting in general? Homemade things are all the rage. If there's something you can create that would be great for gift-giving, make it and sell it!

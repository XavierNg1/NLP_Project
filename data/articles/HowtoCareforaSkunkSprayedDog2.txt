 The spray can cause extreme irritation if it hits the eyes directly. If your dog shows signs of eye irritation—frequently pawing at the eyes, reddened and tearing eyes, eye swelling, squinting, or hard-to-open eyes—try to rinse your dog’s eyes carefully with plain tap water. You should also immediately contact a veterinarian.
 Dogs can also inhale the spray, leading to irritation to the respiratory system, including the nose. This may cause sneezing, nasal discharge, or drooling. Contact a veterinarian immediately if you notice these symptoms after a skunk encounter.
 While the spray of skunks does not carry the rabies virus, skunks are big carriers of rabies. Any time a dog encounters a skunk, there is a chance of exposure to the virus. Consult with your veterinarian after your dog has been sprayed to discuss a rabies vaccine booster to keep your pet safe.
 A very rare but serious condition called Heinz body hemolytic anemia can occur in a dog sprayed by a skunk.This is an emergency. A veterinarian must treat the dog for this potentially life-threatening condition. Signs of the anemia include pale mucous membranes, rapid heartbeat, panting, or a weak pulse.


In a more gradual onset, the dog may be lethargic, weak, and refuse to eat. Signs can occur up to a few days after the dog has been sprayed by the skunk.

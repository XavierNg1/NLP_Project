 It doesn't matter if it's an earlier version or the most recent version as long as it is PowerPoint. My method should work the same on all.;
,, You now need a background as this will be the first part of your game. You could create this on PowerPoint using shapes.
 When designing your background, make sure that objects in the room are click able. A way you can do this is right click, you should see something say Hyperlink. Click on this, but first duplicate the slides a few times so when they click on an object that doesn't do anything it doesn't finish the presentation.
 For example if it was a piece of paper. Have a close up on the paper and what it says, for example a code for a safe.
 This may take a while, but go into detail and try to make it look as professional as possible.
 Basically, if they go left, place a hyperlink on that arrow to take them to that side of the room, or if the other way, the same thing.
 You now need to decide how they escape the room. Don't tell them this though! That's why it's an escape game, they need to work it out. You could provide possible clues though, if you like.
 Congratulate them on their victory.

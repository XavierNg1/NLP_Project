 Begin by peeling the zucchini. Clamp the zucchini in place over the grinder. Crank the spiralizer to feed the zucchini through it. You should end up with 5 or 6 (1/2 to 1 kg) cups of the zucchini noodles., Put the zoodles in a colander. The colander should be set over a bowl. Put a pinch of salt into the bowl. Allow the zoodles to drain during the time you prepare the other vegetables., Roughly chop the cabbage into thin slices. Grate the carrots. Cut the pepper into 1-inch (2.5 cm) segments. Thinly slice the onions into a diagonal. Chop the cilantro, leaving the stems. Put all of these ingredients to a bowl with the zoodles., Put seasoned rice vinegar, olive oil, dark sesame oil, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes into a separate bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until thoroughly mixed. Toss the salad and dressing together. Then, serve the salad immediately.

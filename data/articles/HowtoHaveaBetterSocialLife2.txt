 You don’t have to overdo this, but sometimes people might not think to invite you places because they assume you are either busy or uninterested. An occasional post on Facebook like, “Looking for something fun to do this weekend. Anyone have any ideas?” Will let people know you are available and willing to meet up.


If someone tells you about a fun thing they did let them know you would be interested in participating in the same activity. "Boogie boarding sounds like it was so much fun, I'd love to try it sometime."

, When you show interest in them, they will show interest in you. They might ask you to come with if they are going out for drinks or heading to a museum.Even if they don't you can still get some good ideas for things to do on your own where you might be able to meet new people.
 Not everyone is going to ask you to join them, either because they haven't picked up on your signals or because they may not be able too for their own reasons. The worst thing you can do is be too pushy about being included. Be patient.
 Be willing to do some things that make you a little uncomfortable, knowing that ultimately they will help you grow. This could be something as simple as initiating a conversation at an office party or during your lunch hour at school.

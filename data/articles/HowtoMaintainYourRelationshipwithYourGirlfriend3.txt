 You are with your girlfriend because your list of “likes” about her is longer than your list of “dislikes.” If you want to make the relationship work, however, you’ll need to accept those dislikes. This could mean a lot of compromise on your part.


However, this doesn’t mean you should let go of your non-negotiables. Simply try to come up with an agreement that you can both live with. For instance, she may have her nose in her smart phone all night while you just want to spend quality time. Suggest that you set a designated time aside—for instance, one hour—where you both turn off your phones., You may have gone into the relationship thinking it was going to be your way or the highway. Or, you may have had other unrealistic expectations of how things were going to be. You’ll need to assess which is more important: trying to obtain these potentially far-fetched ideals, or compromising to something that works for the both of you., Determine if the compromise you are asking of or are asked by your girlfriend is actually fair. Some compromises are more like demands and can ruin a relationship. If you believe the compromise you are asked to do is unfair, let her know. You shouldn’t have to give up what makes you you, and vice versa.


The only compromises that you should ask of your girlfriend and she should ask of you are ones that make you better and grow as a couple. Compromises that make you feel bad about yourself and negatively affect your life are typically unfair to ask of one another.

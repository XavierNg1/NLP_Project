 Slugs generally do well in aquariums. An aquarium should be at least 20 centimeters by 20 centimeters (8 by 8 inches). You can buy an aquarium online or at a pet store.Make sure to provide proper ventilation. The lid should have holes for ventilation. Something like a mesh lid, for example, would work well.
Slugs are very small, especially in comparison to reptiles that are usually kept in aquariums. Examine ventilation holes carefully and make sure a slug cannot creep out of these holes.;
, It's best to use soil, grass, and leaves from outdoors for substrate. If you took the slug from outdoors, use soil, leaves, and grass from the area where you found it. Make sure to sift through soil before adding it to your aquarium to remove any bugs.Once a week, remove your slug and put it in a safe container with air holes. Remove the substrate and then replace it.
 Slugs may benefit from certain aquarium supplies such as fake plants and leaves. You can also bring in real material from outside, such as twigs, for slugs to climb on.If you bring anything in from outside, make sure to inspect it carefully before putting it in your slug's tank.
 Once every three months, clean the slug's enclosure when you remove and replace the substrate. You can rinse things like twigs and aquarium supplies in water and then let them air dry outside. If twigs get soggy or soft in response to water, replace them with new twigs.Slugs are very sensitive to chemicals. You should refrain from washing anything with soap. You should only use water to rinse cage supplies.
Slugs are sensitive to tap water, so opt for distilled water.

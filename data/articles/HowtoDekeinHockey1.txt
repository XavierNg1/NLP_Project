 Since if you're playing on tar or ice, falling down without equipment will hurt. Make sure you have the equipment on when trying the deke.
 It is recommended to skate alongside the boards first.,, This makes him go for where the puck was, while you skate past him!

The deke is a great move, but it can be changed to anybody's style and pace, so you can add fancy tricks, fakes, whatever you want; as long as you can keep up, it's fine!

 Notice words that are hard to say together. Then, find words that are hard to say with the initial words, and link them all together in a chain. Try making a list of all the similar-sounding words that you can think of. When in doubt, run a web search for words that are consonant, assonant, and alliterative.
 Your tongue twister doesn't need to be the most insightful sentence in the world, and it doesn't have to be funny â€“ but the words should at least make sense together. A nonsensical group of words might be hard to say, but it won't be as impressive as a cogent sentence., A lot of tongue twisters begin with a name: "Shelly sells seashells by the seashore," or "Peter Piper picked a pack of pickled peppers." This can give some structure to your phrase.Start with a person's name, and then come up with a sentence that tells a short story about them. Answer these questions:


Where did this person go?
What did this person do?
When did this person do this thing or go to this place?
Why did this person do this thing?, Try to say the phrase five times fast, and notice where you trip up. Ask your friends to say it, and gauge how much trouble they have. Rework your tongue twister if it isn't hard enough. Look for words and sounds that you can switch out with harder-to-say syllables.


Bear in mind that some people have more trouble pronouncing certain syllables than others. A hard tongue twister for one person might be easy for another. Always be respectful of speech impediments!

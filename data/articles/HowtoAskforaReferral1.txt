 Targeted referral requests tend to generate a better response than mass emails or a general request on your website. Reach out to individual clients directly.Try to target clients with whom you have a good, well-established relationship. If a client trusts you and is familiar with your work, they’re more likely to give you a great referral.;
, The best time to ask for a referral is while you are still actively completing a project with a client. That way, the client is still fully engaged with you, and has a clear idea of what kind of work you do., There’s no need to beat around the bush. If you’ve been doing great work for a client, it’s completely reasonable to ask for a referral. You can make the request in person, over the phone, or through email.For example, if you decide to request a referral via email, let your client know what you are asking for within the first couple of sentences.
You might start with something like, “Dear Robert, As I work toward expanding my practice over the coming year, I am reaching out to trusted clients to help me generate more business.”

, Your client will be better able to help you if they know exactly what you’re looking for. Target your request to someone the client is likely to be familiar with, or someone who has similar needs to the client’s.For example, instead of just asking, “Do you know anyone else who might need a real estate agent?” try asking, “Do you know any other young couples looking for a starter home in this price range?”

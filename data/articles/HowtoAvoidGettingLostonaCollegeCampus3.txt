 Locate the main student center where lots of important information and resources can be found. Here, there is usually a help desk to assist students and visitors find the area they are looking for, or to provide other usual information. They may also provide you with a campus map.
 Locate the bookstore on the campus. The bookstore is a hub of resources available to students, especially first timers. Here, you are able to download a schedule of your classes, purchase all your required books and any school supplies you may need.


Some campuses, depending on its size, have multiple bookstores. Locate the nearest one to you, such as the one closest to your residence hall or the parking lot that you park in to get to class.
Prepare your schedule. Once you have all your classes, keep a calendar to help keep track of all the times and locations of them for each day. You can do a regular calendar (manual input) or keep one on your computer.
If you need help deciding on a calendar, try Google Calendar. With Google Calendar, you can input your classes just once and it allows you to select a repeat option so you don’t have to manually complete the calendar for the entire semester. You have the option of inputting the class start time, class location, and any other useful notes that you need. You can also synch the calendar with your phone to send you notifications of when class will begin., The library will be your home away from home. It has the benefit of providing you with a quiet and studious atmosphere while you study for classes and exams. Most libraries also have a little café shop where you can purchase coffee, snacks, or other energy snacks to keep you focused and awake as you study.

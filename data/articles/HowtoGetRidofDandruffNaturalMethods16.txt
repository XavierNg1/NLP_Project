 Mix with two cups vinegar.


Stir until completely combined. You may want to use a fork or whisk to make a paste.
 Take extra care to massage the mixture into your scalp. Continue for 5-10 minutes or until the mixture covers your hair completely.
 Then, rinse the mixture out completely.
 Then, you can do this once a week as a preventative treatment.

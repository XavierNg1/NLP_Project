 Wash 3 large zucchini and use a sharp knife to carefully trim off and discard the ends. Slice the zucchini into 1/4-inch (6 mm) rounds and lay the slices on a baking sheet. Turn on the oven to 400 degrees F (204 C).Try to use zucchini that are the same size since this will help the slices bake evenly.;
, Pour a little bit of extra-virgin olive oil into a small dish. Dip a pastry brush into the oil and spread the oil over the slices of zucchini. Bake the zucchini in the preheated oven for 5 minutes.The zucchini should be tender and a little soft in the center. You'll finish cooking the zucchini once you've added the pizza bite toppings.
 Measure out 1/4 cup (55 g) of marinara or pizza sauce, 1/3 cup (37 g) of shredded mozzarella cheese, and 1/3 cup (50 g) of mini pepperoni. Spread a little of the sauce over each slice of baked zucchini and sprinkle a little of the mozzarella cheese over it. Top the bites with some of the mini pepperoni.You can also sprinkle a little dried oregano over the bites for a little garnish and flavor.
 Place the zucchini pizza bites back into the hot oven and bake them for another 10 minutes. The cheese should melt and the zucchini should be soft, if you poke it with a fork. Let the zucchini bites sit for a minute before you serve them. Consider serving the zucchini pizza bites with:Salad
Antipasto
Fresh veggies and dip

, If you'd rather grill the bites instead of baking them, just prepare a gas or charcoal grill. Once the grill is hot, add the zucchini bites directly onto the grate. Ensure that the bites won't fall through the grate. Put the lid on the grill and grill the bites for 3 to 5 minutes. The zucchini should soften and the cheese should melt. Use a spatula to carefully remove the bites. Let them sit for a minute before you serve them.


If there is a lot of cheese on your zucchini bites, you may need to grill them for only a few minutes. This will prevent the cheese from melting off of the zucchini.

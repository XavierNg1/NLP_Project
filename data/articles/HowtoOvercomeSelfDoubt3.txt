 Long-term goals are great, but self-doubt is likely to creep in when you don’t see yourself progressing. To build morale and keep your insecurities at bay, develop short-term goals that allow you to see more immediate results.For example, you might set a goal to double your income in a year. While this goal is motivating, it may help to create smaller goals, too. Try adding other goals like reaching a certain income within the next month. Or, strive to get five new clients in the next two weeks. Make them short-term, feasible, and exciting for best results.
 Sometimes, self-doubt creeps in when you feel incompetent in a certain area. As you work to stop self-doubt, it can help to hone your abilities in key areas of your life. You might do this by joining a professional development organization, taking a certification course, or reading books relating to your industry., Having an ongoing conversation with those around you about your talents and abilities can stop self-doubt in its tracks. Frequently, people avoid discussing areas in their lives in which they feel insecure. When you purposely bring these areas into focus, the self-doubt will gradually disappear. Plus, feedback helps you see both the positive and negative aspects of your abilities.The next time you catch yourself caught in a web of self-doubt, reach out to someone for feedback. For instance, you might say to your partner, “I feel like you are avoiding me. Have I done something wrong?”

, Whether your self-doubt is a recent issue or it stems from childhood insecurity, you must reach out for help if it’s undermining your goals. A professional therapist will be able to help you see your situation from a different perspective and offer practical tips for overcoming negative thought patterns.

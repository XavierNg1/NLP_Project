 Every state has different rules when it comes to being able to get a work permit. You may not even have to go to much trouble -- some states don't even issue them. The Federal government doesn't require such a permit; the law is on the state level.


A list of the states and their regulations can be found here. It'll tell you age requirements and where the permits are issued.;
, This can either be had at your high school (or a participating high school) or online at your state's Department of Labor website. Go to your school's main office and ask if they can help you.


Each state's form is different, too. Here's an example of California's.
 You'll definitely need to fill some of the form out yourself, but you'll also probably need a guardian's information and signature and your prospective employer's information and signature, too. Don't hesitate to ask! This is very routine for them.


Some states won't issue you a work permit until you have an employer that wants to hire you. They may also require workload and scheduling details, too.
You may also need a doctor's note and/or driver's permit, depending.
 This is often someone at your school or the superintendent of area schools. Ask at your school whose signature you should obtain.


If you are home-schooled, you may contact that area superintendent or call your local Department of Labor office -- they may be able to usher on the process for you.
The issuing officer should then give you your work permit. It's that easy! No fee and no waiting. It may be as simple as a Xeroxed piece of paper - so don't lose it!

, He/She should then take it any make a photocopy for his/her records. That bad boy is yours to keep! Unless of course you were issued an online certificate (which some states do).


Many states have websites for employers to check and see if a minor has a work permit. If this could help you, tell your boss! Proof is just a click away.

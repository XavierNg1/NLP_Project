 While Barnes and Noble recommends charging your Nook through an electrical wall outlet, it is possible to charge some Nooks through your computer. The versions that have this feature include: Nook First Edition, Nook Simple Touch, Nook GlowLight, and Nook GlowLight Plus. It is not possible to use a computer to charge the following Nooks: Nook Tablets, Nook HD, Nook HD Plus, and Nook Color., In order for your Nook to charge, your computer must recognize the device. The only way to guarantee that this occurs is if both devices are on. Power up your personal computer and your Nook., Detach your cord from the power adapter. Insert the cord’s USB into your computer’s USB port. Plug the opposite end of the cord into your Nook. Wait for the LED light to illuminate—this light indicates that your device has entered USB drive mode and is charging., When your Nook is fully charged, the LED indicator light will turn off. Once this has occurred, you may eject or unmount the the Nook drive from your personal computer. Unplug the USB power cord from your Nook and computer.


It often takes longer to charge your Nook with a computer than through an electrical wall outlet.
While your Nook is connected to the computer, you may continue to use it by ejecting or unmounting the Nook drive from your computer. Leave the Nook plugged in as you use it.

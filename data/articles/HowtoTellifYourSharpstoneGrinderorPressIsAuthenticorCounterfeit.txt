 There are a number of things wrong with the counterfeit grinders shown. First, SharpStone no longer uses the ™ symbol on their grinders! All new authentic SharpStone grinders will have a ® symbol, because SharpStone is now a Registered Trademark. However, this rule does not apply on all pollen presses. Standard Pollen Presses will have a ™ symbol, while the T-Shaped Pollen Presses will have a ® symbol. The second problem in the first image is that the logo is white on the counterfeit grinder! SharpStone does NOT use ANY white lettering on their non-clear top grinders. Typically lettering/logos will simply be a lighter shade of the color of the Grinder/Press.;
, Many of the counterfeit SharpStone Grinders are anodized in a color that isn't even produced by SharpStone. The only colors produced with the reeling crank handle are: Black, Silver, Copper, or Light Blue. Other types of SharpStone Grinders and Presses are produced in the following colors: Black, Silver, Copper (Brown), Light Blue (Blue), Grey, Red (Burgundy), Purple, Pewter (Green), or Pink. The colors in parentheses are what the colors are labeled on the brown cardboard box, however most retailers refer to the other color name. If you have a color other than what is listed, you might have a counterfeit product.
 SharpStone Grinders and Presses are high quality products! The teeth should never rub together and you should never see metal shavings in your grinder, these are tell-tale signs of a fake SharpStone®. If you have a reeling handle grinder, then you should expect the handle to be sturdy, it should not wobble.
 Notice how few holes are on the counterfeit grinder. Having so few holes in the counterfeit grinder will cause it to clog often. Many of the holes in the counterfeit grinder are also much too large, allowing very large particles to fall through. This leaves the user of the counterfeit grinder with a chunky, poorly ground blend!

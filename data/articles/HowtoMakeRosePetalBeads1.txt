 There needs to be a little moisture left to help with the moulding.
 You can test this after each mince or blend by rolling in your hands. If the mixture stays together in a bead shape, the mixture is ready to work with.
 Do this firmly so that the little bead balls stick together well. Remember that the plant material will shrink as it dries to half the original size, so make account for this in your bead size. Continue until you have made as many beads as required.
 Use a long hat-pin, a thin skewer or a piece of wire to create a hole through each bead. Leave the beads to dry on this to ensure that the hole remains stable and of a good size as the beads dry.
 Place in a warm, dry and well-ventilated place to dry.
 Take the dry beads and thread them onto a necklace thread. Intersperse with a gold or silver bead between each or every 2-3 rose beads for added effect.
, The necklace will keep well for many years. The scent can be retained and heightened by storing the necklace in a small wooden box that is closed and fairly air-tight. Keep the lid closed when the necklace is in storage.

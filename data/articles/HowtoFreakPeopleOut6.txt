 A high-energy approach can go a long way when it comes to freaking people out. Ridiculous dancing is a great way to employ your physical comedy skills. Here are a few ideas to get you started:


Dance in inappropriate places. Try moonwalking through the library or doing the electric slide through the checkout line at the grocery store.
Do spontaneous, flash mob-style choreographed routines. Learn complicated dance or cheerleading routines with your friends and do them in random places, like Walmart or in the middle of the street.
Try to involve strangers in spontaneous dance parties. Bring a radio or laptop into a shop or supermarket. Play a song by Parry Gripp or Bryant Oden (eg. "Do You Like Waffles?"). Start dancing and ask random people if they want to join in. Some people actually may join in if you wait long enough.
Give in to sudden dancing fits. In a mall or another public place, walk around casually, fall to the ground, start dancing, then go back to walking.

 In some countries, they may let you get on last second. Understand that the security in the US and international flights is high and you will usually not be let on.
 Ask for a supervisor or manager. They will reassign you a flight, which can be anywhere from a few hours later to a few days. If money isn't a problem for you, see if you can take a more expensive flight through another airline or airport. You may find yourself on "standby" for some flights, which means that you don't have a confirmed seat, but if one comes available, it's yours.
 Vouchers can save you lots of money in getting a place to stay, and overnight bags normally contain toothbrushes, hairbrushes, razors and shaving creams, and sometimes a t-shirt. If you have any nearby friends or relatives, and they don't mind, you can stay with them temporarily.
 Even if you think you are in the middle of nowhere, if there's an airport, there are probably tourist attractions. If you have a laptop or an internet cafe available, Google "things to do in ". If you're staying at a hotel, they will usually have flyers and brochures near the front that you can look at.
 If you spend time working things out with customer service, it will normally only be a couple of days. Find a nice manager or other representative and ask for them every time you return to the airport.

 Look online to see who has won many major events, or who has the best players. You can look on the sports web site to see who is top notch, stacked, or has the best coaches and trainers. These are all the best ways to decide the team that is great.
 See who is winning more, and who is losing the most. It's important to choose the team that has the best standing, such as, out of 18 games, if the teams stat is 1-17; they are probably the worst team, but if a team has 17-1 they are probably the best team in the league. But, don't choose a team that has a better standing than one, such as, if out of 12 games, one teams stat is 0-12, and another's is 1-11, don't choose that team because it won one game and the other one lost all the games, see if there are teams that are doing a lot better, because, odds are, there will be.

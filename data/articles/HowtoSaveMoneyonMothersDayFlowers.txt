 Start of by going someplace you've seen flowers before. They can be roses, or any other type of flower as long as they're not too small.;
, Make sure you take a pair of scissors used to cut flowers and cut about a foot's length of the stem from the flower. By the way, make sure it's okay for you to cut flowers, you don't want to get in any trouble.
 Find a long piece of silky ribbon and tie them all together. Try to make it look nice and pretty.
 Fill it with water halfway and put the flowers in.
 If you have one of those girly mothers, you can definitely add a few sparkles here and there. Just get some powered glitter (don't get some weird color that doesn't look pretty with the flowers, if you're not sure, just use silver) and put some in the water and sprinkle some on the flowers. Remember not to go overboard with it.
 Now you get hand the gift to your mother in person or secretly put somewhere she'll go or be at soon. Remember to make a little note to her saying its from you and telling her how much you care and love her.

 Celery plants are heavy feeders that require rich soil that must be fertilized frequently. To keep your celery plants happy, fertilize with a nitrogen-rich fertilizer every few weeks from planting to harvest.
 The most important aspect of caring for your celery plants is making sure that they are always well-hydrated. If they do not get enough water, celery plants will become shriveled and bitter to the taste.
 Blanching consists of shielding the celery stalks from the sun to achieve a milder flavor. Cover the stalks with newspaper, a milk carton with the top and bottom removed, or any other type or paper or cardboard. You can use twine to tie the celery stalks to keep them from sprawling.


While blanching is not required, it will alter the taste and color of your celery. Additionally, blanched celery is less nutritious than unblanched celery. Most people prefer the sweeter taste of blanched celery.
Be aware that some varieties are "self-blanching" and don't need to be blanched., You can begin to harvest the stalks when they reach eight inches in height. Make sure to begin your harvest from the outside stalks and work inward. This allows the innermost stalks to continue to mature.


Once mature, celery can sit in the ground for about one month as long as the soil remains a cool temperature between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit.
The longer the celery grows and the darker it becomes, the more rich in antioxidants, and thus nutritious, it will be. However, it will also become more tough and fibrous.

 This is a free app that manages mod files for Minecraft PE. It is one of the only reliable ways to install mods on the Pocket Edition of Minecraft. Another possible launcher app is PocketTool, which uses mostly the same process.


You can find BlockLauncher on the Google Play Store.
BlockLauncher only works with the Google Play Store version of Minecraft PE.
Note that BlockLauncher will not work with Android devices that use the Intel Atom chip. This applies mainly to some Vexia and ASUS tablets and phones. You can see the full list of Android devices running Intel chips here.
 There are lots of mods available for the Android version of Minecraft PE. You can find them on a variety of different mod and fan sites. Minecraft PE mods will have a link to a .js file, which is the mod code, and they may also have a link to a .zip file for textures.


You can only use mods specifically made for the Pocket Edition of Minecraft, and they should be for the version of Minecraft PE you are currently using.
You cannot use mods that were developed for the PC or Mac versions of Minecraft.
 Tap each of the download links to download the mod files to your Android device. Most files are small and should download in a couple of seconds.

 Fill a zip-locked plastic bag partway with water, squeeze out the remaining air, then seal it tightly. Put this inside a second zip-locked bag to minimize the chance of the bag bursting.


Water can damage your shoe and shrink it. Make sure the seal is tight and there are no leaks.
 The bag should fit inside the shoe tightly, but not so tight that you have to force it in. Use more than one bag if there is still room in the shoe, and make sure the tight area of the shoe has a bag of water pressed against it.
 Put the shoes in the freezer with the bags of water inside them. Over the next several hours, the water will freeze and expand. The bags of ice will press against the interior of the shoe, stretching it outward.
 After the water is completely frozen, take the shoes out of the freezer. Let the bags of ice thaw and melt for at least 10 minutes. Take out the ice, or wait until it is easy to pull out the bags without breaking them.
 You can repeat with fresh bags of water immediately, making sure they tightly fill the slightly larger shoes. There is a limit to how far a pair of shoes can be stretched, but two or three sessions of this can stretch it a little farther than one.

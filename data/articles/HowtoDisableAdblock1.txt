 If a site that you visit regularly uses unoffensive advertising, you may want to disable AdBlock for that particular site - a process called "whitelisting" - to access its full content and to support the site.
 If you're not already there, type the site's address into your browser's address bar, and hit â†µ Enter on your keyboard., The icon will be in the upper-right corner of your browser, to the right of your address bar. After clicking on the icon, you'll see a list of AdBlock's options and settings that you can tinker with for your current site as well as for the plugin as a whole.

On Safari, the AdBlock icon will show up to the left of your browser's address bar by default.
 This will cause AdBlock to turn off for all pages in the website you're currently visiting on your browser.

In AdBlock Plus, click the button that says "Enabled on this site." After that, the text will change to "Disabled on this site" and your work will be done!

, A window may appear indicating that "AdBlock won't run on any page containing: website.name/*" where "website.name" is replaced with the name of the website you're on. If this happens, confirm that the slider is dragged to the left of the bar it's on, and click "Exclude" to continue., After clicking the AdBlock icon to reveal its menu, you can click on "Options" to see all of the sites you have disabled and edit them from there.

 Generally, Tinder settings are tailored to people who live in big cities, and want to meet people in the same neighborhood or community. By enlarging the geographical area you’re willing to make matches with, you’ll probably get more.


Go to your settings and make your search distance a little bigger if you want more matches. If it's set at 5 miles (8 km), change it to 20, 50, or even 100. Remember, though, to make a match, potential matches must have similar distance settings.
If you live in a rural area, you might consider making your search area very wide. If you'd be willing to go anywhere in the state for a meet-up, consider it., A larger age range will open many more possible matches. Ultimately, you may discover many people you wouldn’t have otherwise matched with.


Start by expanding your range a little bit. For example, if you originally searched for 25 to 30, expand that range to 20 to 35. You might find you have a lot in common with people that are younger or older than you.
Think about your comfort range. For example, if you’re 25, will you be comfortable dating someone that is 7 years younger or 7 years older? A 14-year range might provide you with many matches., Tinder has recently introduced Tinder Boost. This service allows you to pay a fee to temporarily put your profile toward the top of the swipe list. By paying this fee, more people will be able to see your profile – thus increasing your matches.


Tinder Boost moves your profile up for 30 minutes at a time.
Tinder has said that their service may increase your views by 10 times.
The boosting service costs between 3 and 5 dollars depending on your market.
Tinder Plus users can boost their profile for free.

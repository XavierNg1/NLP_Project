 Partial transparencies also stack, meaning you can use this to "shade in" images realistically. If you need a partial edge or gentle transition, set the brush or eraser opacity to 10% or so. Now, every time you shade over that area, you erase 10% of pixels each time. So, if you erase it 10 times in one area, then move over and erase 8 times, then 6, etc, you would get a nice, gradual merge.
 Found through "Selection" → "Refine Edge," this shows off what your image will look like without a background. This allows you to see your new photo perfectly, fine tuning it before merging it in. Any selection, on any layer, can be refined. When done, click "Selection" → "Inverse" and hit the Delete key to erase all the pixels you refined out.



Radius: Shrinks the edge all the way around. Each pixel you "add" cuts a pixel closer to your selection.

Smooth: Rounds the edges

Feather: Adds partial transparent "blur" to the edge of the selection.

Contrast: Makes harder edges and points. Opposite of "Smooth."

Shift Edge: Grows or shrinks the entire thing based on the percentage you supply., This feature will sync up the two images, like a group photo where one person closed their eyes. Pull in another copy where they have their eyes open, then select both layers by Ctrl/Cmd-clicking them. From there, select "Edit" → "Auto-Align Layers."


Select "Reposition Only" for the best results., Blending modes relate one layer to another. So, for example, if your bottom layer has strong lighting, you can tell your top layer to take some of these light pixels and use them to lighten up your top layer. Sound confusing? The best part is, it is simple and easy to experiment without permanent damages. To use them:


Click on the top layer of the ones you're merging.
Click on the drop-down menu, currently set to "Normal" above the layers.
Choose a new blending mode, noting how it changes your image. Try out

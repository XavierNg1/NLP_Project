 To get your sim preggers, your relationship with the father must be at least a romantic interest. You must use romantic socials until it says, "Sim A think Sim B is extremely irresistible". Once you've gotten to this point, you're ready. Make sure there's a double bed somewhere in the lot they're on, and click "Try for Baby" with the father. After the Woo-Hoo is done, listen closely-- if you hear a little musical lullaby after the Woo-hoo, congratulations your sim's pregnant! If not, keep trying.;
, Go to the grocery store at some point during the pregnancy. Buy three fruits, watermelons for girls, and apples for boys. Any more than three won't increase your chances any further.
 Any time before labor and after conception is okay. NOTE: The fruits will not always result in that gender of baby, but they will significantly increase your chances. Also, baking the fruits into food to eat doesn't increase or decrease your chances.

 If your symptoms do not improve with home care, you should go see your doctor for a diagnosis. You may want to see an otolaryngologist (commonly known as an ENT physician) who specializes in diseases and disorders of the ears, nose, throat, and related areas of the head and neck.Start by describing your symptoms to your doctor so they can get a sense of your condition. You may experience nosebleeds, difficulty breathing, or nasal whistling, where a whistling sound happens when you try to breath in and out of your nose. Be forthcoming about your symptoms so your doctor can make a proper diagnosis.For example, your doctor may ask you, “When did you first notice issues with your nose?” “What kind of symptoms are you experiencing?” “How long have you had these symptoms?” “What do you think is the cause of these symptoms?”

, Your doctor will then examine your nose externally and internally. They will be looking for a hole in your nasal septum, any tissue buildup on a wound in your nose, or any crusting inside your nose.The doctor may need to do an rhinoscopy or a nasal endoscopy to determine the location of the hole in your nose. This requires the insertion of a very small camera and light into your nose.
The physical exam can be done in the doctor’s office. You will need to remain still and calm during the physical exam so the doctor can do a thorough check.
 The doctor may also run tests on your urine and run a blood test to determine if there are any diseases or conditions that are causing your nasal tear. They may also do a biopsy of septal tissue in your nose to test for any fungal or bacterial infections.If the doctor suspects drug use, they will screen you for certain drugs to determine if this may be the cause of the nasal tear.

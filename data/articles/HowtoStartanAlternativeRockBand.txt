 Ideally, most bands have a singer, lead guitarist, bass guitarist and a drummer. With other positions like keyboardist, acoustic guitarist or tambourinist, which are not used very commonly. A lot of Alternative Rock groups mainly focus on guitars. For example, Coldplay use a vast style of guitarists. Usually there are at least one guitarist and bass player, but ideally, you could have two guitarists and a bass guitarist. It is vital that you have a drummer and a singer, and it is quite helpful with a keyboardist.;
, Having a good band name is VERY important. You can just use something random like 'Grim Skunk Violation' or something meaningful like 'Frozen Arsenal' the possibilities are endless! If you are stuck in finding a band name, use this site: http://www.1728.org/bandname.htm.
 If you are at school, you could probably use a music room at break or lunch, or if you are out of school, you could probably rent a room for a small fee. You could even use your own garage, as long as your family is okay with it.
 Each band usually has a designated song writer, but you may decide that everyone will write songs.
 You could play at a fair, or charity event, if your council lets you. Eventually, after some concerts, you will start to attract fans!

, After a while, you should have a reasonable amount of fans, who should be looking for a CD of your tracks. On your album, you should have at least 6 songs, and a colourful cover and name for it.
 Make a musician's account. Get your friends to send you Myspace to their friends, and so on. Pretty soon you'll have a whole fan-base!

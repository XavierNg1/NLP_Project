 Cut them in half and sew the yellow top and the red bottom together. Add the black lightning shape near the waist and the "Flash" symbol near the chest.
, You'll need a yellow zentai mask, a white plastic face mask, foam balls, red craft foam, red spray paint, a hot glue gun, and scissors.


Cut out shape of KF's mask from the white plastic mask. Cut of the top of the zentai mask and hem it. Then attach the plastic mask to the inside of the zentai mask. Cut out and hem the eyes, nose, and bottom, so it recreates KF's mask. Color in the foam balls with the paint and cut out the two lightning shapes from the craft foam. Attach these onto the craft balls and attach the lightning-balls to the side of the mask.

 As with any formula, start with an = sign, then use whichever functions or arithmetic you'd like. We'll use a simple example spreadsheet, and add column A and column B together:



Example Spreadsheet


Column A
Column B
Column C


row 1
10
9
=A1+B1



row 2
20
8



row 3
30
7



row 4
40
6



, Once you hit enter on your keyboard, the formula will be entered and calculated. Only the result (19) will be displayed, but the spreadsheet will still have the formula stored.



Example Spreadsheet


Column A
Column B
Column C


row 1
10
9
19


row 2
20
8



row 3
30
7



row 4
40
6



,, Click on one and drag up or down using your mouse or the arrow keys. Unlike with the corner drag method, the cells you are copying the formula to do not need to be adjacent to the cell you are copying from.,

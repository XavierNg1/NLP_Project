 In order to do anything you want, you need to learn the requirements to get there. Find out if your goals require college, training, or money. Once you figure that out, find out where you have to go for those services, or how you can acquire what you need.


As with any project, groundwork and preparation pay off. Research it, cost it, and have a project plan.
 Don't just think about what you want in your life, but actively write out a detailed five-year plan on how you will get there. Try making a chart or spreadsheet that has categories for the things that are important to you and a column for each year.


For example, you can make a row for education, career, or relationships that each has five columns, one for every year. Your year five will have your ultimate goal that you are working towards for each category.
This is how you can distinguish your short-term and long-term plans.
 If the goal you want to accomplish seems big and time-consuming, don't get intimidated. Break down the path that leads to your dreams into smaller, more manageable steps. This will allow you to experience more successes that will keep you motivated and on track.

 Your friends and family can be vitally important to you during this time. If you are living away from home, you may want to transfer to a college where you can live with or near family. If you have a partner, make sure that they do their share to care for the child, especially if it is their own.If you develop a close relationship while in college with a new friend, see if they can watch your baby every so often. Try to make it only once a month or so so you don’t exhaust them.
 Find out if there are any clubs for student mothers or fathers on your campus. Get to know people in your class and find out if they have children. You will be able to relate to them much better than to your other peers who don’t know what it’s like to be a student and a parent. Spend time studying with them or even taking turns watching each other’s kids so you can have a night to study or do work., Avoid becoming isolated. If you're taking a walk with the baby, invite someone to come with you. Be social whenever you can and continue to develop and maintain your friendships. You do not want to get so caught up in your baby that you forget to have a life outside of being a mother or father.
 Just as your child is important, you are important, as well. Your baby cannot be well cared for if you are not taking care of yourself. Each day, be sure to eat three healthy meals, try to work out at least every other day, and be sure to take care of your hygiene. When possible, treat yourself to a new outfit and even a vacation occasionally.

 Choose somewhere that is well lit, so that you can see what you're doing with ease, and the colors appear realistic.


It's a good idea to begin with a small piece of paper, then as your confidence grows, you can paint larger sunsets.;
, For a sunset, the following colors are recommended:


Windsor Blue or blue
Cadmium Red or red
Lemon Yellow or yellow
Cobalt Violet or purple
Rose Madder Genuine or pink
Windsor Orange or orange
Windsor Green (yellow shade) or dark green.
 Use a 6B pencil (or whatever pencil you prefer to draw with). Once the line has been drawn, on the upper half of the watercolor paper, dampen it just a little with water, using a size 10 Brush (or big brush).
 Paint in lines, going back and forth. Do not cover the entire paper with yellow paint; you'll be adding other sunset-related colors shortly.
 Paint swiftly, randomly and spontaneously, moving the brush lines back and forth across the yellow part of the paper.


Use only a little touch of Windsor Blue.
 Use a size 6 brush and Windsor Green and Cobalt Violet paint for the hills. Keep them simple at this stage; you can be fancier when you gain more confidence.
 Paint back and forth using the same colors as you did for the sky. For more reflective look, use white pastel and draw short, wavy lines before painting the lake.
 Now you can show off your painting of a sunset to your friends and family. Keep practicing; the more you do, the more your own creativity will take hold and the sunsets will begin to look much more professional.

Windows Vista: Click "Display Settings" option in the Personalization menu.
Windows XP: Click the "Settings" tab after selecting "Properties".

 Your current resolution will be shown in the "Resolution" drop-down menu or slider.
 The Recommended resolution is the native resolution of your monitor. Selecting this will result in the clearest image.


Windows Vista and XP do not display the "Recommended" resolution. You will need to refer to your monitor's manual to determine the native resolution.
 Clicking the "Resolution" drop-down menu in Windows 7 and 8 will display the slider. Drag the slider to change the display resolution on your monitor. Resolutions other than the recommended one will result in a blurry, stretched, or squished image.


Selecting a lower resolution will increase the size of objects on your screen.
If you don't know the native resolution of your monitor, set it to the highest possible option for the clearest image.
 Your screen may flicker and shut off, and then the new resolution will be displayed. You will be asked to keep the changes or revert to your old settings. If you don't pick an option after 15 seconds, the image will automatically revert.


If you want to keep your changes, click Keep changes.
If you don't see an image after changing your settings, just wait for it to revert.

 Wash patio pillows in a gentle cycle and tumble dry on low. The tennis balls will help beat out excess moisture and will speed up the drying process., If the tag says that your patio pillows aren’t machine washable, take the removable covers off and wash them in the washing machine twice a season., Washing all of the fabric every time one little stain appears on your piece of furniture will make the colors lose vibrancy and have your fabric looking worn faster. When there’s something small that you want to clean, soak a sponge with mild soap and water and spot clean the problem area., Brush off as much mildew as you can with a scrub brush first, and then spray the umbrella with an equal mixture of vinegar and water on problem areas. Leave the umbrella alone for half an hour to let the mixture soak in and then gently scrub the umbrella to remove whatever mildew is left and spray it down with a hose. Let the umbrella dry out in the sun all day.

Also take these steps, minus the scrubbing, to regularly clean your mildew-free patio umbrella.

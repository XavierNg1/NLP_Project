 Brush your wet hair with a wide-toothed comb, a boar bristled brush, or other gentle, soft bristled brushes. These types of brushes allow you to remove tangles without breaking hair. Curly hair tends to tangle as it dries, so continue to brush throughout the drying process.;
, Place one section on either side of the head and one in the back. Itâ€™s best to dry the lowest layer of hair, closest to the head, first. Use hair clips to keep the upper layers of each section of hair separated. Brush each section gently taking care not to snap hair strands in order to remove tangles before you begin drying.
 While brushing with one hand, follow your brush with the electric dryer. Move the blow dryer to-and-fro from the top to the bottom of each section in even motions. Once each section of the bottom layer of your hair is dry, let down another layer of hair from each section. Continue this process until all the layers of your hair are dried.


You may also want to consider using cool air to straighten hair. This takes a little longer than blow drying with heat, but it prevents potential damage to hair that occurs with the application of heat.

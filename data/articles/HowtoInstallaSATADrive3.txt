 Most laptops only have one hard drive slot, so if you replace your hard drive you will lose access to all of your old data. Ensure that anything you need is properly backed up, and that you have your operating system installation discs handy to install the operating system after the new drive is installed.
 Turn it over and remove the battery. Make sure that the power cable is not plugged it. Ground yourself, either by wearing an antistatic wrist strap, or by touching grounded metal.
 The location varies from laptop to laptop, but generally it will be located behind a panel on the underside of the laptop. You may need to remove stickers to access all of the screws.
 Usually, you can pull a piece of ribbon to pop the hard drive out of the connectors. The method will vary depending on your laptop model. The hard drive should be easy to remove from the laptop once it has been disconnected.


Some hard drives will have cages attached to them. You will need to unscrew the cage and then attach it to the new hard drive before inserting it.
 Place the hard drive in the bay and press it firmly into the connectors. Make sure that the hard drive is lined up correctly before applying pressure. The hard drive should plug snugly into the connectors without a significant amount of force.


Secure the hard drive with any screws or clips that you removed to get the old one out.
 Once your hard drive is secured and the panels have been replaced, you can power up your laptop. Your new hard drive should be recognized automatically, but will not boot since there is no operating system present.

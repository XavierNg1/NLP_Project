 The most obvious place would be your backyard. It'd be best to have a clean-up of your yard of any rubbish that could injure little kids playing on it (such as rusted metal), and make sure it is a good size. Even better if you have things like trampolines or swingsets for the children. If you don't have a suitable yard, you can ask a close friend or family member to use theirs. If it's a small party, you could also use a public reserve or park.;
, You'll want to do this about a week or two in advance. A good amount would be between 5 and 10 kids, as you will have to be cooking a lot of food if you have any more than that. For invites, use a cute image of a teddy bear on the front and be sure to ask everyone to bring their own teddy or stuffed animal.
 Party favourites like chips, sliced fruit and vegetables etc. can all be used. You'll also want to include some teddy bear themed food like perhaps a teddy bear shaped cake. Make sure it's all able to be easily transported if your picnic is not in your own home. Also, keep in mind that young kids can be very fussy when it comes to food, and parents may want healthy food for their kids.
 A simple picnic rug on the ground with plastic cutlery and plates will be fine for food. Try putting drinks like juice in teapots for a more classic and charming feel. You can use pastel bunting hung from trees, helium balloons tied to teacups and more to decorate. You may want to set up an outdoor table with nibbles and coffee/tea for the adults, so they can socialize while keeping an eye on their kids.
 While the picnic may be fine by itself for a short party or younger kids, you may want to include other activities to keep kids occupied. Try a teddy bear scavenger hunt for chocolate coins, a teddy-bear dress up station, a bouncy castle or an obstacle course.

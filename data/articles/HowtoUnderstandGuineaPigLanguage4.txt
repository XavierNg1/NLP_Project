 These squeals are similar to the curious squeals, except they are a negative tone and have a larger time frequency than before. The pitch of their voice also goes from low to high quickly to express their annoyance.


If this happens, be sure to calm them down to make them happy. Stop whatever is bothering them; stop touching them in certain areas, separate it with other piggies, pet its body, or let it release its waste.
 That condition is that they will never pee or poop on their owners no matter how badly they need to go. Once they are far away from their owner, then they will release it wherever they feel like.

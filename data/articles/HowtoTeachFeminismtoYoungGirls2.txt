Don't just tell the child if something is wrong. Ask questions about it, and help them think it out.
 Point out some examples, like "boys don't cry," "girls need to look pretty," and "boys are good at STEM and girls are good at language and art." Talk about how they can be limiting, and encourage her to make her own choices.Try not to pressure her to break stereotypes, because this may make her feel limited. Allow her to explore art, fashion, beauty, and whatever else interests her. Explain that there's nothing wrong with being stereotypical, only with expecting people to be.
 Help her notice when women are being objectified, or when beauty is over-emphasized. Remind her that most people don't look like the women on TV, and the women themselves probably don't even look like that in their everyday life., A feminist wants to stand up for people who are being harmed, encourage kindness, and help others in need. Teach her that she should do the best she is able to do when she can.


Be a role model. Acknowledge when you mess up, and be ready to learn and apologize.Teach her not to beat herself up if she fails. Say "You did the best you were able to do at the time."

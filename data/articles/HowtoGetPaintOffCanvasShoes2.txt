 Use a coarse brush or toothbrush to flake off the dried excess paint. For smaller stains, you may be able to pick off dried chunks with your fingernail. Removing the dried top layer will allow you greater access to the set-in stain underneath. It will also be a more efficient, quicker way of removing the larger part of the stain.
 Apply a solution of one part detergent, one part water, to a damp cloth and apply it to the stained area of the shoe. Depending on the size and strength of the stain, you may need to apply some nail polish remover to a damp cloth and work that into the stain, as well.









Do this until the paint softens into the fabric of the shoe. Once the dry paint has softened, it will be easier to dissolve away from the fabric.
 Use a dull knife to scrape off the now soft paint. The paint should rub right off the shoe. There will still be a light layer of paint set into the fabric below. However, the large majority of the paint should now be gone.
 Use a solution of one part detergent, one part water, applied to a damp cloth. Continue to rub the remaining stain with the solution. Rinse with cold water by holding the stained area under a faucet. Continue this process until the stain is completely gone.
 If the stain still remains, apply some nail polish remover to a damp cloth. Dab it on the stain and continue until it disappears.

 If you feel like you're not understanding the material in your classes, donâ€™t be afraid to ask your professors or peers for help. The resources vary by college, so find out early how you can get help.
 Ask your classmates if they want to study. It can make studying more fun AND you can learn a lot.
 Use them as motivation to improve. This is just an assessment to let you know your status in the class. You still have time to improve if they disappointed you.
 Make sure that you understand the material as you go along so that you can use the days before as purely review.
 Buying yourself clothes, eating a hearty meal, or going out and having fun with friends are just some ideas to get you started.
 If you have been working hard and are still struggling, check in with the professors. Some will offer extra credit.
 They are typically quite knowledgeable about research. Good librarians usually a degree in library science, and have done research and published papers.
 Only consider buying them if you think you will find the useful in the future. Also consider buying their e-book version, if available, to save money.

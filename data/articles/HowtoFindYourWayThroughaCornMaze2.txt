 It is easy to get panicked if you are lost. Take a deep breath and count to 10. Sit down for a few minutes and close your eyes to regroup before trying again. Remember that corn mazes have preparations in place for those who get lost.


Good corn mazes keep count and have staff walk the maze. If you keep your head clear, you’ll make it out just fine.
 A corn maze employee may have handed you a flag to use in case you get lost. Raise and wave your flag if you have one. Some other corn mazes have watch towers or call boxes where employees can keep an eye on you. Other have corn cops that wander through the maze in search of people who need help., As a final resort, try yelling. An employee should be able to follow your voice to find your location in the maze. Yelling may also result in another non-employee person to come to your aid. Don’t yell unless you absolutely feel that you need to get out of the maze immediately.
 Tell them the name of the farm. Give them your best guess as to your location in the corn maze. Let them know if anyone is hurt or the nature of your emergency.

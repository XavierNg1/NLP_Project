, More than likely if your enemy does not have a DMR then you have the advantage in most cases because the DMR only takes five shoots to kill a Spartan III and six to kill an Elite (assuming the last shot was a headshot). Just unload until his/her shields are down and get the headshot.
 Then start shooting them. Pace your shots. Wait 1 second after each shot to let your reticle reset then shoot again and again until there shields are down.

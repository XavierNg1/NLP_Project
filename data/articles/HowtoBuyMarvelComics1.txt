 If you can't find a local comic shop, grocery stores and major book stores, such as Borders and Barnes & Noble, usually carry Marvel Comics.


Comic shops tend to have a wide selection of Marvel Comics titles. They typically carry all the current issues in addition to older archived comics. Some shops also buy and sell used comics.
Book stores usually have a moderate selection of Marvel titles. They carry popular compilations and series, along with some of the current issues.
Grocery stores typically just sell current issues of a select few Marvel Comics titles.;
,, Most stores allow you to read through the comic before buying it. This will allow you to determine the condition of the comic and if it is worth purchasing.
 A store clerk will scan each comic and ask for payment. Cash and credit card are common methods of paying for comics, though some grocery stores may accept checks.

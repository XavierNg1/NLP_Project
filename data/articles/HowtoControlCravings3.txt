 Before you can control your cravings you must first understand what cravings you are having and when those cravings occur. When you track your cravings, you will be able to identify exactly when, where, and how you should try to combat them. You should note several things in your craving log.When did the craving occur?
What did you do to fulfill your craving? For example, did you eat a particular food?
How much did you consume? Was it as much as you usually eat?
If you resisted your craving, what helped you be successful? For example, did you distract yourself or use a replacement?
How did you feel afterwards?

, A craving occurs when your brain chemicals are imbalanced. When you fulfill that craving, “feel good” chemicals are released. Your brain receives this positive feeling and associates it with your craving. Start reading reputable books or articles about the neurochemistry of cravings and addiction to gain deeper insight into why your desires are so strong., Some of these risk factors include being hungry, tired, lonely, or angry. These risks cannot be prevented in all situations but should be avoided as often as possible. Taking care of yourself physically and emotionally will help you have the willpower to resist your cravings.For example, if you don't get a good night's sleep, pack a few low calorie, nutritious snacks like fruit, nuts, and string cheese to help you combat cravings due to tiredness.

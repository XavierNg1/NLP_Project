 Generally it is mutual affection, trust, loyalty, and acceptance that contribute most to our lasting friendships.So think carefully about which of your friends you feel most comfortable and relaxed around. Good friends are people who take you as you are, and like you for who you are. This support is key to mutually great friendships, so think about who you are really closest to, and can really talk to.;
, If you are going to choose one friend over the other, it's unlikely that your overlooked friend will still want to do things with you. If one of your favourite things is going to the movies with Sarah, then think carefully about whether you might actually be closer to her than you thought. Being relaxed around someone is a good indicator of a strong friendship.
 One practical way to measure up friendships is to write down a list of things that irritate you about somebody. This could be a cathartic exercise, but try not to get too carried away. If all the points seem fairly trivial then it indicates that you don’t have major differences.


"Has an annoying laugh", is less significant than "always interrupts me", or "isn’t there when I need them".
Compare the lists and mark the points you have written "serious" and "trivial" to get a clearer picture.
 The more positive side to this list-making is writing up what you really like about your friends. Think about their personality, how they treat you, and what you do together. Don’t put down more superficial things, even if they have got a really cool haircut or a nice house.


Compare the two lists and pick out the most significant things.
"Accepts and likes me for who I am", "we always have loads of fun", and "completely trustworthy" are examples of excellent friendship indicators.If you write the positive list last, it will leave you with a warmer feeling about your friends.

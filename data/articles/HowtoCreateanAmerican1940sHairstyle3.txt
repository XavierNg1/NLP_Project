 Side reverse rolls involve rolling a thick strand of hair into a circle and pinning it down

,,,,, Teasing is a technique used to volumize one's hair through an "in and out" motion with a comb while holding the hair tightly. In order to create as much volume as possible, separate your hair into parts to make this process more manageable.
 Starting with a roll and a slight tuck, begin your roll from the back and move slowly towards the front to get that vintage look.
 This is an extremely important step because it allows the curls on one side to hold.
 Finish the look off with more pins and hairspray.
, Use a small portion of hair cream to clean up with a shine.


Women with round or wide faces benefit from the height of the hair, that elongates the face. Women with oval faces will also look good with this hairstyle.
Women with narrow faces can style the rolls more outward than up and will balance their features, but it may not work for all women of narrow faces.
This can also can be a good look for women with glasses, so long as the frames aren't so thick on the sides as to disrupt the flow of the hair up from the face, so wire glasses would look best.
Women who want a better balance between their figure and face will achieve a nice balance with this hairstyle. The hips, bust, and hairdo will all be in better proportion for curvier women, to heavier women.
Slender women should wear this style in a more petite manner with limited height and width in order to keep proper proportions.

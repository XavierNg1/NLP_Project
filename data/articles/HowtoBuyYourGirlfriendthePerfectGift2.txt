 This option is great if you donâ€™t have much money, and often, your girlfriend will value it more if it you made it. Making a gift takes more time and effort than just buying something online, but it doesn't need to take days. Plus, you know it will be unique. Don't worry, you don't have to be Van Gogh to make a beautiful gift she'll love.
 Since most photos are on the computer or phone these days, actually giving her physical photos can be nice. You can either put photos in a simple scrapbook or frame several photos of you two together., Whether she loves tea or hot cocoa, try putting together a little kit of her favorite beverage. For instance, for hot cocoa, you could make a homemade cocoa mix with little packets of marshmallows and several small bottles of Bailey's on the side.If she likes tea, try making an arrangement of all her favorites, plus some fancy honey. Include a fancy mug to top it off.
 If your girl loves to soak in the tub, making bath bombs will be perfect for her. Pick an essential oil she'll love to scent them, and she'll be in bliss.


To make a bath bomb, simply mix 2 cups of cornstarch with 1 cup of citric acid, and 1 3/4 a cup of baking soda by shaking it through a sieve.Fill up small spray bottles with water. If you want to color you bath fizzies, add 6 drops of food coloring.Measure out 1 cup of powered mixture. Use the spray bottles to add small amounts of water to the powder. Mix it up after each spray. The mixture is ready when it holds together when squeezed.Add in the essential oil. For an essential oil with a heavy fragrance (such as peppermint), add 5 drops; use 6 if it's lighter (such as lemon). Stir the fragrance in. Put the mixture in small baking molds, preferably ones that hold about 1/4 cup, enough for one bath. If smaller, use two bath bombs per bath. Repeat for the rest of the dry mixture.

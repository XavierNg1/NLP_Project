 Set to 180ºC/350ºF. Prepare the baking trays (sheets) by lining with baking (parchment) paper or silicone sheets., Place the cornflakes into a food-grade plastic bag. Place down on a work surface. Lightly crush the flakes using either your hands or a rolling pin. They should still have large pieces in them, so do this very gently. Place the crushed flakes in a wide, shallow bowl that you can easily dip the dough pieces into., Cream together using a small electric beater or a spoon/fork. Beat until the mixture becomes light and fluffy., Add to the creamed mixture slowly, a bit at a time. Beat in well each time., Beat through to combine., Transfer the butter and sugar mixture to the large bowl and mix to combine all ingredients., Do this using a metal spoon, not the beater. Stir the mixture together to combine well and turn it into a smooth cookie dough., Dip into the cornflakes mixture and roll around to coat in the cornflakes., Continue with the remaining dough until all cookies are formed. Leave plenty of room between each cookie for spreading during baking., Bake for 15 to 20 minutes. When the cookies look golden and crispy, they are ready., Let cool briefly on the baking sheet. Transfer to a cooling rack and allow to cool completely. They're now ready for eating.

 Once you have the equipment you want to use, you will need to level it up. To do this, you’ll need Weapon and Armor Fortification Scrolls, which you can get as a reward from certain quests and monsters. The scrolls have a chance to either level up your equipment or to add to the equipment’s Potential points, which basically represent the amount of points you need for a successful level up.
 To use the scrolls, you’ll need some Fragments. You can do this by using the “Salvage” option, represented by a claw hammer icon, at the bottom of your inventory. When you have any equipment that you haven’t sold or used, you can salvage them for a small amount of Fragments, and occasionally on higher levels, some nifty other items you can use to improve your weapons. This is a great way of getting rid of loot when you’re in an Instance Dungeon and running out of space.


At the lowest levels, you can get by with just scrounging up at least 20 Fragments, but at higher levels, the amount of Fragments you get from Salvaging and the amount you need for upgrading increases. Don’t be afraid to salvage multiple weapons and armors you aren’t using or you don’t need.
 To actually level up your equipment, click the shiny sword icon next to the Salvage icon. That’s the “Fortify” button, which opens up the Fortification menu. Now, on the lower right portion of the Fortification screen, place the weapon or armor on the left-hand slot, then the Weapon or Armor Fortification Scroll on the right. It will then show you how many Fragments you’ll use up per scroll, and if you have enough, you can just keep fortifying until you’re satisfied!


Keep in mind that Basic Fortification Scrolls only work up to level 9, and Advanced Scrolls only work up to level 20.

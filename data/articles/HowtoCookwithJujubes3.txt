 Fill a large saucepan with 3⅓ cups (780 milliliters) of cold water. Add 3⅔ cups (825 grams) of sugar, and 2 teaspoons of cornstarch. Bring the water to a boil over medium to medium-high heat to dissolve the sugar and cornstarch., Wash and dry 2 pounds (907 grams) of dried jujubes. Prick each one with a fork a few times.This will make it easier for them to absorb the water and sugar., Reduce the heat to a simmer over medium-low to low heat. Let them cook, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Ever so often, give the mixture a stir., Let the mixture reach room temperature first. Cover the saucepan with a lid, then store it in the fridge overnight., Place the saucepan on the stove and remove the lid. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium to medium-high heat. As soon as it is boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer. Allow it to cook, uncovered, for 30 minutes., Set them aside on rimmed baking sheets lined with aluminum foil. Don't try to cram them together on one sheet, or they won't dry properly.

Don't throw the syrup away! Keep boiling it until it reduces to 1⅓ cups (320 milliliters). Pour it into a glass bottle and use it as a syrup on pancakes and waffles. Store it in the fridge., Preheat your oven to 275°F (135°C). Place the baking sheets into the oven, and let the jujubes dry for 2 to 5 hours.Every so often, turn them over so that the other side dries. They are ready when they are dry like dates.

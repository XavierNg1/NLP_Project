 This is the easiest part.;
, Underneath login, there should be a little sign that says "join DeviantArt for free!" Click on it.
 This should be fairly easy; create an original username, and a good password to protect yourself from hackers.
 Usually, in order to post your art, you need to click on that email, which will verify your account.
 You did it! You are now apart of a fun, inspiring website. Enjoy!

 You will need a bowl, water, beans, a knife, a journal, and a magnifying glass. You can use any large bean such as a kidney or lima bean. You may also consider having a worksheet or print out of the bean’s structures.;
, You want the beans to be soft enough to cut. This will allow you to perform the dissection without destroying the bean. An easy cut is essential to preserving the structures inside the been., Write your thoughts down. Include an illustration of what you believe the inside of the bean will look like. A basic sketch is okay if you do not draw well., There is a line that runs down the middle of most beans. Use this line to guide the bean open. The bean should be evenly split. Use a knife if you need to cut the bean in half along this line.An adult should cut or supervise the cutting of any beans.
 Use a magnifying glass to see all of the details of the bean. Some structures may not be easily recognizable to the naked eye. Make notes or sketch what you see.
 You will find the embryo, cotyledon, and the seed coat. Label each of these structures on a diagram. If you don’t have a diagram, sketch the structures out in your notebook., Look at the predictions you made in your journal before the experiment. Determine how many of the structures you predicted are actually in the bean. Record your comparisons in your journal alongside your hypothesis. Ask yourself:


Was your hypothesis correct?
If not, what was different?

, Now look at a dry bean. This bean will have the same structures, but they may be visibly different. Record your comparisons in your journal. Answer things like:


What are the similarities?
What are the differences?

, Allow the soaked bean time to dry. Observe the same bean again. The embryo will be easier to identify when the bean is dry. Record your observations in your journal.

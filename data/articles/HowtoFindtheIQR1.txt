 Essentially, it is a way of understanding the spread or "dispersion" of a set of numbers.The interquartile range is defined as the difference between the upper quartile (the highest 25%) and the lower quartile (the lowest 25%) of a data set. The lower quartile is usually written as Q1, and the upper quartile is Q3 – which would technically make the halfway point of the data set Q2, and the highest point Q4., To visualize a quartile, chop a list of numbers into four equal parts. Each of these parts is a "quartile."Consider the set: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.


1 and 2 are the first quartile, or Q1
3 and 4 are the second quartile, or Q2
5 and 6 are the third quartile, or Q3
7 and 8 are the fourth quartile, or Q4

, In order to find the difference between the upper and lower quartile, you'll need to subtract the 75th percentile from the 25th percentile. The formula is written as: Q3 – Q1 = IQR.

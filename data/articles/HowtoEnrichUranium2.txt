, Because the 235U isotope is lighter than the 238U isotope, UF6 containing the lighter isotope will diffuse through the membrane faster than the heavier isotope.
 The repeated diffusion is called a cascade. It may take as many as 1,400 passes through porous membranes to get enough 235U to enrich the uranium sufficiently., Once the gas is sufficiently enriched, it is condensed into a liquid and then stored in containers, where it cools and solidifies for transport to be made into fuel pellets.


Because of the number of passes required, this process is energy-intensive and is being phased out. In the United States, only one gaseous diffusion enrichment plant remains, located in Paducah, Kentucky.

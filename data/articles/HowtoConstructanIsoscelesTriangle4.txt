 To use this method, you need to know the length of the triangle’s base, and the height, or altitude, of the triangle. You can also use this method if you are given line segments representing the base and altitude instead of the measurements.

For example, you might have an isosceles triangle with a base of 5 cm and a height of 2.5 cm.
 If you know the measurement, use a ruler. For example, if you know that the base is 5 cm long, use a ruler to draw a line that is exactly 5 cm long.


If using a line segment instead of a measurement, draw the base by setting the compass to the width of the base. Draw an endpoint. Use the compass to draw the second endpoint. Then, connect the endpoints using a straightedge., This means a line that cuts the line in half. You can use a compass and the method described here. Draw the line at least as long as the triangle’s altitude.


You can also use a ruler and a protractor to bisect the line. Divide the length of the base in half. Use the ruler to draw a midpoint. Then, use a protractor to draw a line at this midpoint that intersects the base at a 90-degree angle.
 If you know the measurement of the altitude, use a ruler to open the compass to this exact length (for example, 2.5 cm). If you are given a line segment, open the compass to the length of the provided line.
 Place the tip of the compass on the midpoint of the base. Draw an arc across the bisecting line. You need to draw the arc only on one side of the base.
 Connect the point where the altitude and arc intersect with either endpoint of the base. The resulting figure will be an isosceles triangle.

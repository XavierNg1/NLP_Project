 Add ½ cup (115 g) of sugar and ¼ cup (59 ml) of olive oil to a small bowl. Use a spoon to carefully stir the ingredients together until they’re fully blended.The recipe calls for a 2 to 1 ratio for sugar and olive oil. Adjust the amounts to make as much or as little of the scrub as you’d like.
 When the sugar and oil are mixed, stir in 2 to 3 finely chopped strawberries. Use a spoon or fork to muddle the fruit into the sugar and oil mixture until they are just combined.Avoid overmixing the berries into the sugar mixture. It can cause the sugar granules to dissolve.
The strawberries help brighten and tone your skin.
 When all of the ingredients are combined, spoon the scrub into a jar or other container with a lid. Keep it in the refrigerator, and it will stay fresh for up to two weeks., To use the scrub, apply it to a dry face with clean fingers. Use a circular motion to rub it into the skin and gently buff away dead skin cells.Be careful not to rub too hard with the scrub. The skin on the face is fragile and can easily become irritated if you scrub too hard.
 After you’ve applied the scrub, wash it off with warm water. Use a clean towel to gently dry your face, and apply your usual serum, moisturizer, and/or other treatment products.You can use the scrub one to two times a week for brighter, clearer skin.

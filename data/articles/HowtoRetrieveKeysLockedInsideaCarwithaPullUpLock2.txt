 Find a long piece of string that's at least 3 feet (91.44 cm) long. You can use yarn or a thin rope. If you don't have access to any of these materials, you can even use your shoelaces., To create a slip knot, make a loop and feed one end of the string through the loop. Make another loop 5 inches (12.7 cm) away from the first loop using the same method. Finally, feed the second loop you created through the first loop and pull the loose end of the string to tighten the knot. This will create a knot that you can tighten by pulling on one end.
 Place the string in the top left of the door and wiggle it back and forth by holding both ends of the string. Continue wiggling the string until the string gets squeezed inside of the car.
 Position the string so that the middle of the string is closer to your door's lock. You may have to fiddle with the string until you can get the loop in the slip knot directly over the lock. Carefully drop the loop around the lock.
 Once the loop has caught on the lock, pulling one end of the string will tighten up the knot. Pull hard so that you get the string as tight as possible around the lock. Older model cars will be easier to open using this method., Pull on the top part of the string while letting go of the other end of the string to pop open the lock. You should now be able to open the door and retrieve your keys.

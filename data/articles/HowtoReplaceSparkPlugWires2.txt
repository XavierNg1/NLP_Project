 Never try to replace plug wires on a running motor. Likewise, do not try to replace plug wires on a motor that's too hot to touch.
 Once located, take note of the length and location of each wire. You will need to put each new wire back where you pulled its corresponding worn wire â€“ and it will be much easier if you write down what you've done. If you connect the wires in the wrong order, your engine will misfire and run poorly. Try marking each wire with tape and a number (corresponding to a spark plug location) so that you don't lose track., Replace the wires one at a time, and in a specific order or direction. This may help you remember which wire goes where, and it will reduce the risk of putting the firing order out of sync with the engine. Take your time. Start with one wire, and completely finish replacing it before moving on to the next one.


The wire is connected at both ends. You must unplug each side before installing the new wire.
The spark plug must fire when the piston is nearly at its highest point in the cylinder. Thus, it is imperative that you do not get this sequence out of order. Try starting at one end of your engine, and working across.
 Use a spark plug wire removal tool to unplug and remove the wires. Use caution when you pull the wire from the plug. The newer engines have rubber boots that fit tightly over the plug, keeping it dry and clean. Remove the wire by pulling on the boot. If you pull on the wire instead of the boot, you may destroy the wire, and some of it will be left on the plug.Some of the wires can be very tightly stuck to the spark plug. Grasp the rubber boot firmly. If it doesn't pop off immediately, try twisting it back and forth while you pull it free.
Inspect the boot for signs of carbon tracking. This will appear as a black line running from top to bottom inside the boot. If you notice this line, the spark plug must be removed for inspection.

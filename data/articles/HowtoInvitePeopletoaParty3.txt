 No need to be sneaky about it -- just send them a quick message online. If you don't have their online info, ask a friend who likely has their information.
 They'll be less excited about your party if you're calling them when they're in the middle of a meeting or in between bites of food.


Before or after dinner is usually a safe bet. People are generally less busy between 5 and 6pm, or after 7pm. Gauge what time they eat dinner (different cultures, different times) and work around that. Earlier in the week is best, too.
Don't call too late! Call before 9:30 or 10:00pm. You don't want to wake anyone up with what should be a warm and welcome invitation.
 Chat with your guests as you fill them in on the details of your party. Your winning personality will sell the party for you!


Try starting out with the usual pleasantries. "How are you?", "How is work going?", and "How's the family?" are often good starting points. Choose a natural pause in conversation or termination of a subject to bring up that you are having a party.
After you have alerted them to the party, you can answer any immediate questions the guest might have, and even gauge interest through tone of voice.
 The spoken word can be easily forgotten, and it may be worth emailing, texting, or mailing them some of the details. They could be swamped with a dozen other things going on, even if they are really interested in your party.

Make sure they know what's expected of them. Sometimes getting involved (like bringing a dish) can get them remembering and even looking forward to it.
 You're not nagging them; you're simply getting a head count so you can plan your party accordingly.


If they can't give you a yes or no on the second go-round, it's best to discount them. If they show up, fine, but if they don't, it's no skin of your nose. The party will still go on and it'll be great.

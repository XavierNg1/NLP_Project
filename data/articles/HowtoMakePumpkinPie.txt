  Line a pie pan with pie dough. Place pie weights, or dried beans on the dough to prevent it from rising. Bake at 325ºF (165°C), just until lightly brown—about 15 to 20 minutes. This step is optional, but will help prevent the crust under the custard from becoming soggy.;
, When you are done with the pie crust, preheat your oven to 425° F (318°C).
 Combine and mix the pumpkin with the eggs, doing this in a large bowl. Mix both ingredients well.
 In a medium bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves, and blend thoroughly.
 Pour the blended spices into the pumpkin and egg mix, and stir thoroughly until the ingredients are well-blended.
 Pour the melted ice cream into the pumpkin mix. Mix until well blended so that the white streaks from the ice cream disappear.
,, Bake about 45 minutes longer, or until inserted knife comes out clean. Keep an eye every 10-15 minutes or so to make sure the pie crust edge is not getting too done. If it starts to look a little brown, cover it with a pie shield, or wrap the edge in tin foil.
 Have the pie cool so the custard sets.

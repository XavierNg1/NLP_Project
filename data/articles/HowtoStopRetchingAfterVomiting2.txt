If you can’t stop vomiting and aren’t able to keep down any liquids, you might need medical attention to avoid dehydration.You should also see a doctor promptly if you vomit blood, are experiencing diarrhea, or have a fever.
 If you take any oral medications regularly, taking them during a vomiting spell could upset your stomach. Further, if you vomit them up immediately, your body didn’t absorb them.Call your doctor or pharmacist and tell them about your condition. Ask them, “Should I hold off taking my prescription until a few hours after I’ve stopped vomiting?”

, Vomiting and retching could be associated with any number of medical conditions, from food poisoning to chronic digestive issues. If you experience regular patterns of vomiting and retching, you should talk to your doctor about imaging, urine, and blood tests to diagnose any underlying conditions.X-ray and ultrasound imaging can rule out ulcers, blockages, gallstones, and other issues.

 Most cases of Toxic Shock Syndrome produce symptoms that can easily be mistaken for the flu or some other illness. Listen closely to your body to help ensure that you don’t miss such important signs of TSS.TSS can cause a fever (usually above 102 degrees Fahrenheit or 39 degrees Celsius), major muscle aches and pains, headaches, vomiting or diarrhea, and other flu-like symptoms. Weigh your risk for getting TSS (for instance, if you have an oozing surgical wound or are a menstruating young woman using tampons) versus your likelihood of having caught the flu. If it is reasonably plausible that you may have TSS, keep a close eye out for other symptoms.;
, If there is a “telltale” sign of TSS, it is a sunburn-like rash that appears on the palms and/or soles of the feet. However, not every case of TSS includes the rash, and the rash can occur on any part of the body.People with TSS may also notice significant redness in or around the eyes, mouth, throat, and vagina. If you have an open wound, look for signs of infection such as redness, swelling, tenderness, or discharge., Symptoms of TSS usually appear two to three days after infection, and often start off mild in nature. They will, however, progress rapidly as the condition worsens rapidly, so be vigilant in watching for them if you have any inkling that you might have TSS.Watch for a rapid drop in blood pressure, usually accompanied by dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting; confusion, disorientation, or seizures; or signs of kidney or other organ failure (such as significant area pain or signs of improper functioning).

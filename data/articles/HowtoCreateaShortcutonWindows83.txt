 If you right-click on a Start screen app, you'll find that you cannot create a shortcut to it to move anywhere, you can only pin it to the taskbar. This is because the app on your Start screen is already a shortcut. You can open the shortcut folder to make a copy of the shortcut yourself.


You cannot create shortcuts to apps that run on the Windows 8 Modern UI. This means most apps from the Windows Store.
 Select Open file location. If you are using a touchscreen, touch the icon and swipe down with your finger to open the right-click menu.
 Windows will open the folder with the shortcut you've selected. You can now copy it or send it to the desktop as a new shortcut.

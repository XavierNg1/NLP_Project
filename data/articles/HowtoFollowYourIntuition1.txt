Try some basic meditation techniques to help you become more mindful of your physical state.Find a quiet and comfortable place to meditate where you will not be bothered or distracted.
Sit in a comfortable position, close your eyes, and focus on the sensations of your own breathing. If your mind wanders, gently redirect your attention to your breathing.
Try doing a “body scan.” Lie down, close your eyes, and mentally focus on each part of your body in turn, starting with the toes and moving up to the top of your head. Be aware of any sensations you are experiencing in each part of your body, and make a conscious effort to relax any tensed muscles. When you are done, focus on your entire body for a few minutes. Take a few minutes to focus on your breathing.
 While it may seem illogical, distraction can actually help you come to a decision. Your brain processes information on a subconscious level even if you are not actively focusing on it or thinking about it. If you find yourself struggling to make a decision, do something else for awhile. Then return to the problem, and go with the decision that feels “right.”, Sleep is important for resting and repairing our bodies and minds, and it also helps process information that we take in during the day. If you’re having trouble making a decision, try putting it aside and getting some sleep. When you wake up, you may find that your intuition has led you to a decision.

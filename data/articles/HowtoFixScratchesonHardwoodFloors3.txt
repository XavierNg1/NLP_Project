 Wipe down the scratched area with a damp rag moistened with water.This will remove the cleanser, further sanitizing the workspace.


Allow the damped area to totally dry before moving on.
 Gently rub over the scratch with fine steel wool. Be sure to rub following the grain of the wood. Lightly sand away the scratch until it blends in with the surrounding wood. Once the main scratch is blended into the wood, you may need to focus on lightly sanding the edges of the scratch to ensure everything looks uniform.


Use a clean cloth to wipe off the floor and clear it of any dust from sanding.
 Rub a wax stick over the scratched and sanded area to fill in the scratch.Wood wax can be clear, but they also come in common wood shades like honey, and different shades of brown.Allow the wood wax to dry and harden for at least 10 minutes.Wood wax sticks can be found at home department store, paint stores, or local hardware stores.
 Use a clean, soft cloth to rub back and forth over the scratched area, and buff the wax.Buffing the wax will smooth the scratched area, remove excess wax, and restore shine to the floor.

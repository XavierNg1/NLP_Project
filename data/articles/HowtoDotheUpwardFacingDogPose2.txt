 Your legs should still be lying flat on the floor. Look straight ahead of you with your chin propped on the mat.
 Squeeze your shoulder blades together.
 Straighten your arms, bringing your torso and legs up off the floor as if you were doing a half push-up. Your weight should be distributed between your hands and toes.
, Draw your shoulder blades deeply back to lift your heart forward and up. Hold the pose for a couple breaths, then release your body back towards the floor.

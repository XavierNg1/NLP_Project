Repeat 20 times with both legs.

 This stretch helps to lengthen the plantar fascia and is similar to what you will do if you wrap your foot. Cross whichever leg is affected over your other leg. Using the hand on the same side as the hurt foot, grab the sore foot and gently pull your toes back towards your shin.This creates some tension or stretch in the arch of the foot and at the plantar fascia.
Hold this stretch for 10 to 20 seconds and repeat 10 times.
 The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society recommends doing stretches that target your Achilles tendon and plantar fascia to help treat plantar fasciitis and reduce the risk of a recurring injury. For these exercises, make certain you move slowly, gently, and smoothly. Don’t make any quick movements because this may re-injure the plantar fascia.Repeat these exercises at least three times a day. Do these stretches especially after you have been sitting for a long time and when you get out of bed in the morning.

 If you're not particularly busty, this isn't quite so necessary, but it's recommended if your character wears anything like a tank top. Use either a binder or a compression shirt for this. DO NOT USE ACE BANDAGES OR TAPE, as these can cause fluid buildup in your lungs. If you use a binder, make sure you know how to prevent injuries and fluid buildup in your lungs.
 Luckily most men in anime have long girly locks anyway, but if the character you've chosen doesn't, are you willing to have your hair cut short just to play him? If not, consider a wig. Even if you have long hair, you CAN fit it all under a short wig! Likewise, if your character is supposed to wear a hat, you can take advantage of it by simply tucking your hair into the hat.
 Take on any of his gruff mannerisms (if crossplaying a butch man, it's likely he has nicknames for girls such as "doll" etc.)

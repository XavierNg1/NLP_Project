 Are you trying to teach a youngster sounds or to read small words? Are you trying to teach larger phrases or something else?


Consider the child's ability and age too. If you're working with a younger, preschool student will may need to “jazz” up the slider or purchase larger index cards to make it easier to read.;
, You will want the words or sounds to be challenging but not so challenging that they'd only be suitable for an older child. You don’t want your student to become frustrated working with material meant for an older learner.


Identify the number of words or the amount of time appropriate to spend on playing a word game based on the child’s age, skill level and maturity.

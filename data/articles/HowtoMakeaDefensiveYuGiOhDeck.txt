 Even if your deck is focused on defense, you still need a way to win. This can involve burn, mill, an alternate win condition like Final Countdown, or just stalling long enough to use up your opponent's resources and summon powerful monsters you can win with.
 Sort them into monsters, spells, and traps. Note any cards that can help you negate attacks or damage, or that help with your strategy.
 You do not necessarily want ones with high defense, because it will be easy for most decks to get over it. Instead, use ones that can destroy opponent monsters, negate attacks, negate their own destruction, or prevent damage. Good ones are Marshmallon, Swift Scarecrow, or Spirit Reaper., Use cards that can negate the opponent's attacks, like Scrap-Iron Scarecrow, Threatening Roar, or Waboku. Also, use cards that prevent your opponent from attacking, like Swords of Revealing Light, Level Limit - Area B, Gravity Bind or Ordeal of a Traveler. Hand traps like Battle Fader, Swift Scarecrow, or Speedroid Menko and cards that end the battle phase are also good. You can also decrease their monsters' ATKs with effects like Burden of the Mighty or Half Shut., Use cards like Raigeki, Dark Hole, Lightning Vortex, or Lava Golem/Kaijus to preventing them from building up a powerful field and overwhelming your defense. Also, use attack response traps like Dimensional Prison, Mirror Force, and Quaking Mirror Force., These include cards like Mystical Space Typhoon, Twin Twister, Solemn Warning and Solemn Strike, Torrential Tribute, and Compulsory Evacuation Device., Use Xyz monsters you can summon, and a few synchro monsters if you have a tuner. This can get you out of tough situations or provide an alternate win condition for you.

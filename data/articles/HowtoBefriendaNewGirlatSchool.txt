 Look yourself in the mirror and say that you are the most confident person out there and that you can do anything to get that girl's attention. Remember that the new girl is probably just as shy as you are and will be happy to have someone introduce themselves.


Say "Hello" first. Go up to the new girl and say hi to her. Ask what her name is and tell her yours.;
, Give her advice when it comes to certain teachers, and make sure she knows where all her classes are. Offer to give her a tour of the campus.
 The first few weeks are often hard, so try to make the new girl feel as welcome as possible. Invite her to sit with you at lunch, introduce her to your friends, and help her out with any other questions she has. Offer to exchange phone numbers or email addresses.
 Invite her to your house to do homework, or go out to dinner and talk. Get to know her, and let her get to know you.
 Not every new girl that comes your way will be the perfect match for you and your friend group. If you and this girl hit it off, awesome. If not though, don't stress about it. Just because you do everything right in welcoming her doesn't mean that you'll have compatible personalities.
 Don't force commonalities between you and this new girl. Remember that a friendship based on lies is doomed to fail.

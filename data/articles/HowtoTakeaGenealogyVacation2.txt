 Having the information you need ready will save time over having to look for it when you need to consult it while reading archival documents or when asking questions.


One way to organize your documents is with a 3-ring binder that zips or snaps closed. You may want to use dividers or Trapper-style folders to subdivide your documents by the family members you're researching or by the research sites you plan to visit.
 Looking like a researcher instead of a tourist and being focused will help you get both the co-operation and assistance of courthouse workers, librarians, and cemetery caretakers in finding the information you want.
 Let the people who are assisting you with your research know as precisely as possible what you're looking for. Identify the ancestor by name, date, and place of birth, and mention what records you've already checked, then ask, "What other records do you have that can help me?"

, If you visit a cemetery during a funeral, while someone is purchasing a plot, or while maintenance work is being done, ask if there's a better time to return. Always thank the people who've assisted you, even if you don't find out any genealogical information.

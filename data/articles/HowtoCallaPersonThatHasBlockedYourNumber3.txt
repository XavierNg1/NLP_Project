 This person probably blocked you for a reason. Make sure that you're not harassing the person in any way, or you may exacerbate the problem. Carefully consider the "why". Ask yourself whether this call will actually resolve anything tangible, or whether it's just a way for you to make your presence known.


Be considerate. If you are truly making this person uncomfortable, you should give them space. Things resolve themselves in their own time – but pushing the situation too far might erase that possibility.
 If you continually call someone who doesn't want to be called, it may be grounds for them to take legal action against you. If it happens often enough, it may constitute harassment. This person could take out a restraining order and make it illegal for you to contact them, period. Consider whether this one phone call is worth it.The Caller ID Act of 2009 made it a crime to use Caller ID spoofing for harming or defrauding someone. If you use a service to block or change the way that your phone number appears, be very careful about how you use this power., Consider why you need to reach this person, and whether you can fill this need in a less invasive way. It can be very tempting to call someone and say what you need to say – but this may not be the most productive tactic if the person in question feels invaded by the prospect of speaking with you on the phone.


If you simply need to express your feelings and get closure, try writing a letter or email to the person in question. The person may feel less threatened if he or she has more time to read and respond to your words.
If it's an emergency and you legitimately need to reach or find someone: reach out to mutual friends, or contact the police. Seek out someone neutral who can help you reach this person.

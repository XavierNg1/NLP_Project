 Cut off any dry tips from the stems of the cilantro in your bunch. You should also remove any old or damaged leaves at this time.


It is also a good idea to cut off the tough stems completely for this method. The stems are not necessary since they will not be drawing in any moisture, and removing them can make it easier to fit the cilantro into a tight container.
 If the cilantro is even a little moist, you should dry it with clean paper towels or by putting it through a spin in a salad spinner.


Cilantro will go bad much faster if the leaves are still wet, so it is crucial that you get as much water off as possible. To be on the safe side, the best option is to spin the cilantro in a salad spinner and spread the stems out in a single layer on a dry kitchen towel. Place the towel in direct sunlight for a few hours to further dry the cilantro.
 Arrange a single layer of cilantro on top of it, then cover the cilantro with another paper towel. Repeat this pattern, alternating back and forth between cilantro and paper towel layers.


If possible, only keep one layer of cilantro in a container. Crowding the container with too much of the herb can actually cause problems.
Regardless of how many layers you have, the bottom and top layers should both be paper towel layers.
Snap the container shut when done. Make sure that the seal is airtight.
Do not use a plastic bag instead of a plastic food storage container for this method.
 Cover the container and place it in your refrigerator. It should stay fresh for two to three weeks.


Check the cilantro periodically during this time. Look through the sides of the container if using clear plastic, or quickly remove the lid and peek inside if using a container made of tinted plastic. Remove any wilted or discolored cilantro. If you notice any moisture, dry the container and send your cilantro for another spin in the salad spinner.

 This is important especially after eating or preparing greasy foods, as you might transfer the food oils into your hair. The same with oily makeup––pin your hair back of your face before applying the makeup and don't touch your hair with fingers covered in makeup. Keep your hair neat without touching it too much also––use a comb to remove tangles, not your fingers.;
, This will help to keep your hair from becoming more damaged and it will appear thicker and stronger.


If you don't do it sooner, you'll have to cut off more of it later because there is only one guarantee and that is that split ends get worse!

, You can use baby powder or dry shampoo to make your hair look less greasy. Simply rub it in to your roots, but be careful not to put too much in so that people can see whiteness on your hair! Try combing it out afterwards.
 Your forehead can be an oily skin zone, so keeping hair off your forehead will help to ensure that it doesn't absorb the oils from your skin.


If you don't want to blow dry your hair, instead clip your hair off your face as it dries naturally, so that it will still be off your face when it drys.
Or, wear your hair with the front clipped back in a quiff when it is dry.
 Straightening the hair really damages it, both through heat or chemical processes. The heat from the straighteners makes your hair produce grease, and since you'll be touching your hair to straighten it, this risks producing more grease.
 Permed or naturally coarse/curly hair shows grease more slowly, since the hair doesn't lie close to the scalp. If you have natural curls, flaunt them.

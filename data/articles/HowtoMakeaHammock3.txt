, This is optional, only if needed. Allow for sag in the middle, below your feet and above your head before choosing to cut.


If you want to be able to use the item again for its original purpose, avoid cutting it.
 Tie this together with either a lark's head knot or clove hitch using strong rope.
 Then send it across to the opposite tree or anchor point. Repeat the wrap and tying process at the other end of the tarp or blanket. This will ensure a taut line is drawn above the hammock bed, which you can pull on to get in and out of the hammock. It also provides a place to hang a rain fly.


If you don't want the fly rope, you can always cut your rope in two, keeping the head and foot sections separate.
Use the tarp as a rain fly. If the tarp is twice as long as you are, double it over and hang above the hammock. This will create a fly for keeping off rain or for providing shade.

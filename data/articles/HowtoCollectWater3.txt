 Always use new, food-grade tanks. If you buy one used, make sure you trust the seller as to what was stored in the tank. You don't want to store your water in a barrel that previously held gasoline, transmission fluid, or another potentially-toxic chemical.
 Determine how much water you need to collect, depending on zoning restrictions and your water needs. Depending on the climate that you live in, a smaller system might be more effective than others.


For example: if you want to water a garden and you have no restrictions on having a collection system, then you might just want to have some 20-40 gallon drums with a spigot at the bottom. Support the drums with cinder blocks. You can hook this up to standard rain gutter collection system).
If you want to be more ambitious—say, a water feature and then some—then you will need: a larger container to accommodate the larger amount of water (or many small containers that make a large system); better supports (a small, reinforced slab); a larger amount of area covered for to gather water; and some pumps.
 You can use iodine tablets, boiling, or other purification methods.

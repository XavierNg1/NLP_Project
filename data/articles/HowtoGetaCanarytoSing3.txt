 Your canary will not sing while it is molting, and may not sing during non-mating seasons as well. Often, this means your bird is less likely to sing during the summer and the winter. However, if a bird suddenly stops singing without an apparent change of temperate or lighting, take it to a vet., If you know you have a male canary and it simply does not sing, this does not necessarily mean anything is wrong with it. For help diagnosing reasons it may not be singing, see a vet that specializes in taking care of birds. You should take your bird in for an annual check-up even if nothing seems wrong. Talk to a vet then about any curiosities you have about their singing behavior., There are certain signs you should watch out for. These may affect singing, but may also pose a serious danger to your canary. Watch out for permanently fluffed feathers, missing feathers, or incessant plucking. Also be on the look out for any swelling, unusual marks, discharges, or wheezing and coughing. Further, see a vet if your bird stays low in their cage, stops eating, or holds either foot or wing in odd positions.

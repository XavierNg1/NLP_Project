 Parents may have a hard time forgiving because they are concerned you may make the same mistakes again. Demonstrating that you learned from your mistakes and developed ways of avoiding repeating them will help your parents to let go of the past.


If you are struggling to identify more appropriate responses, ask your parents to help you. They will appreciate that you are making the effort to improve, and it's another opportunity to make them feel heard.
 Show them you are responsible by studying to earn good grades or getting a job. Remind them how great you are by taking on a leadership role at school or in the community. Involve yourself in activities they would be proud to tell others about and reduce their concern about how you're spending your time. Parents forgive more quickly when they can focus on your new achievements, rather than past failures.


Consider volunteering to serve others in your community to really make them proud. You can find lots of volunteer opportunities online., Help them forgive you by distracting them from your past behavior and focusing on future possibilities. Set goals for 6 months, 2 years, and 5 years from now, with action plans to achieve them.


Your 6 month goals should be reasonable. Set goals for improving grades, saving money, and/or improving you physical and mental health.
Your 2 and 5 year goals should be complex but attainable, a good example might be to graduate college.

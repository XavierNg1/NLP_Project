 You don't need to ask a girl out to spend time with her one-on-one. She may feel less pressure if you simply ask her to go do things together without labeling these outings as dates. If she always agrees to spend time alone with you, she's probably interested in you too.For example, you could go out for coffee, buy music together, check out a farmer's market, or just go shopping.
 Think back to the things she likes and try to do something out of the ordinary for her. The classic is giving the girl flowers or something romantic like a poem. However depending on what she likes, you could do something original that's also romantic. For example, if she's really interested in original artwork, paint her something.Don't worry that whatever you give her isn't professional quality or expensive. The point of the romantic gesture is to signal your feelings for her.
 While you're spending time together one-on-one, tell her how much you enjoy being with her. Let her know that you have fun hanging out in a mutual group too, but place the emphasis on your time alone. You could also mention how important she's become to you or how your feelings have developed towards her.If you're anxious about hinting to her directly, consider texting or calling her. You might find that you have more courage when communicating electronically. This will also give her a little time to process her feelings and respond to you.
 Casually flirt and see how she reacts. If she's encouraging you, she may smile, flirt back, tease you or laugh. These may be signs that she's interested in starting a romantic relationship with you. If she gives you the cold shoulder, tells you to stop it, or seems uncomfortable, give her some space.You can keep spending time in mutual company, but if she doesn't respond well to your flirting, you should consider moving on. If she does like the flirting, continue paying her attention and trying to spend more time together.

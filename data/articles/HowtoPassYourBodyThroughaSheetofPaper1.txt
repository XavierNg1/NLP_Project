 Make sure you're folding so the page is wider rather than longer (hamburger fold)., On the edge where you made the fold cut a long and skinny rectangle. Leave about an inch on the page., Start on the inch stub from the previous cutout on the left side. Cut upwards towards the edge that hasn't been cut. Stop once you're about an inch away from the edge., Now flip the paper over and start your incision from the edge that is loose. Repeat whatever the width of the initial strip was for this strip. Do the same method as before. Stop about an inch from the edge of the page., Continue flipping the page after each cut until you've reached the other side of the paper.
 Carefully unfold your paper and you should have a flimsy ring that you can fit your body through. If you had any strips that were too thin, it could turn out extra flimsy. Practice a few times before trying to impress anyone.

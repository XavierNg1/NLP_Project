 You will be working with spray-on sealers, which are sensitive to humidity. Also, if you are working outside and it is windy, you might get some dust embedded in your fabric.

 Let the spray dry completely before using the fabric. Most waterproofing sprays will dry in about 4 hours, but you might want to read the directions on the can as each brand will be a little different., Seam sealer usually comes in a small bottle with an applicator on top. Simply roll the sealer over the seams while squeezing gently on the bottle. This will make the seams extra durable and ensure that no water gets inside.

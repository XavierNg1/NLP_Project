 Check bathroom and kitchen cabinets, the attic, basement, crawl spaces, and garage. Look for pipes running along outside walls of your house or through your foundation as well.


Use tools or have a professional licensed plumber repair any leaking pipes or pipe joints before wrapping them.;
, The pipe's material can determine what kind of insulation product you use. Check hot and cold water supply pipes since both kinds of pipes can freeze.


Plastic pipes should only be wrapped with automatic heat tape. This kind of tape is insulated with heavy rubber around its wires.
 Count the number of faucets or valves along each pipe. These figures can help you determine how much insulation product you will need to buy.


Consult your pipe manufacturer's guidelines to help you decide how much insulation you will need.
 Purchase enough pipe insulation product, such as heat tape or cable, for your pipes.
 Wrap pipes carefully with the insulation product.


Heat tape has a plug at 1 end to heat a pipe electrically. From the plug end, run the tape straight down the length of the pipe if directed to by the manufacturer. You may need to wrap heat tape in a spiral or corkscrew fashion around a pipe instead.
Wrap areas of pipe that go below ground with heat tape until you reach the frost line.
Secure the heat tape to the pipe with bands of electrical tape wrapped around the pipe's diameter. Space the bands of electrical tape according to the heat tape manufacturer's directions.
 Cover the insulation with a waterproof material if it does not have weather protection.
 It should go directly into a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) outlet without using an extension cord.


Look for a GFCI outlet under your home, near where your water supply comes in.

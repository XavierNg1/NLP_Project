 Butter and other oils with a low smoke point shouldnâ€™t be used. The best choices are canola oil, grapeseed oil, vegetable oil, corn oil, peanut oil, safflower oil and sunflower oil.


Olive oil is also a popular choice for small, shallow fried foods.;
, It should be deep enough for shallow frying most foods, but you can also use a deeper cast-iron skillet. You will only fill the frying pan about one-fourth way full of oil.
 If the oil gets too hot and starts smoking, you are likely to burn yourself. Wear long sleeves, an apron and keep oven mitts nearby.
 If you insert a wooden spoon into the oil, it should bubble around the edges. You can also use a deep fry thermometer if you want to be more accurate.
 Never drop them from far away. Splashing oil can cause severe burns.
 You may need to check the bottom edge by turning it up lightly with a spatula.
 Try to cook in batches of food that is the same size, so that you can keep a constant cook time.
 Lay them on paper towels to drain and dry. Serve as soon as you can.

 A true friend is someone that you have a great time with. You should be able to make your own fun, laugh together, get in trouble, and genuinely enjoy one another's company. It's not necessary that you have to laugh with your true friend---deep and meaningful conversations for a long period of time are usually are helpful to nurture a friendship.
 A true friend will always be honest with you, no matter what. It doesn't matter whether it's about something trivial, like whether your outfit looks good on you, or something life-altering, like if they found out that your partner is cheating on you. A true friend will never keep you in the dark. This doesn't include their telling you about their personal affairs all of a sudden. This will take a little time since your friendship isn't that ripe yet!

, A true friend will be fiercely loyal to you, whether you're present or not. This means that they'll stand by you, even if they don't agree with your decisions and stick up for you when nobody else will. However, don't expect them to stand up for you when you truly are wrong. If they do, reconsider their being a good friend.
 You can trust a true friend with anything, whether it's to feed your cat while you're on vacation or to keep your deepest, darkest secrets. If your secrets litter around the whole school, and the only person you have told it to would be your best friend, then they are not really considered real friends.
 A true friend is there when you need them, to share the good times and help you through the bad ones. They return your phone calls. They show up for the lame double date you made them agree to. They don't go M.I.A. when the going gets tough.
 A true friend is supportive of you and your goals. They won't try to change you, make you feel uncomfortable to holding you back.

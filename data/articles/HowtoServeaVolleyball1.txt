 Place your feet about shoulder width apart, but staggered in an up-and-back position.


You should be able to rock back and forth in this position without fear of falling over, as it is the most stable.
Make sure your feet are planted on the ground and you are not standing on your toes.
You will begin with your weight shifted to your back foot, while maintaining your stance with your front foot fully on the ground as well.;
, You should hold the ball in your secondary hand (the one you don’t write with), with your other hand laying at your side.


Hold the ball in front of your body, above your hips and just below your waist.
Don’t hold the ball too far out from your torso, otherwise you won’t be able to hit it with your opposite hand.
Don’t grip the ball too firmly, but rather let it rest on your palm using a gentle grip with your fingers to keep it from falling.
 Your upper body and shoulders should be leaning forward slightly, and you should keep your eyes on the ball at all times.
 Close your hand, with your fingers tucked in and your thumb resting at the side.
 Using your hand with a closed fist, swing your arm in a pendulum motion to hit the ball.


Swing your arm with your palm facing up and your thumb facing out.
Don’t wind your arm up very far prior to the swing; bring it back the same distance as you have to swing forward. For example, if you have to swing your arm forward half a foot, then swing with your arm only half a foot behind your starting position.
Shift your weight forward slightly from your rear foot to your front, in time with your swing.
 Aim to hit the ball just below the center, so as to propel it slightly upwards and over the net.


Drop the hand holding the ball just before making contact with your swing.
Follow through with your swing. Don’t stop your arm from moving immediately upon hitting the ball, but allow it to propel forward to give your hit more power.
Keep your eye on the volleyball the whole time to aid in making contact.

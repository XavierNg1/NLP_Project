 You can find out if your site's been indexed pretty quickly by doing a couple of simple searches.


While your first thought may be "Google it," there are actually 2 primary search engines: Google and Bing. Note that Bing actually comprises Bing, MSN, and Yahoo.;
, If it does not appear, it has not been indexed yet.
 It's possible one will show as indexed, and the other not.


Searching for your site's content as opposed to its URL could give you misleading results. For example, if you have a site about juggling, you do a search for "juggling" and don't find your site on the first few pages, you might assume it hasn't been indexed. But consider that "juggling" returns nearly 7 million results, and you will see that it's possible you are indexed, just not in the top 50 results. Or even top 5,000!

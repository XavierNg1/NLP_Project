 One of the best ways you can work to prevent violence in schools is getting involved. This may mean joining the PTA at your child’s school, coaching a sports team, or organizing a community event. The better you are able to get to know your child (as well as the other children around them), and build a sense of community, the less likely violence is to occur., You can help prevent violence in schools by encouraging young people to speak up when they see or hear something that’s not OK. Some students may not want to get involved, but explain that by conveying information through safe channels, they may be able to prevent a serious threat of violence., Children and young adults today face a number of stressors that many adults are not fully aware of. The pressures of social media, substance abuse, dating and sex, and bullying can weigh heavily on young people. The pressure to succeed in school can also overwhelm young people. Becoming aware of the sources of stress in the lives of your children or students can make you a better advocate and source of support when they need you., Memorizing this acronym and teaching it to students can both work to prevent violence, and create a plan of action should violence unfortunately occur.

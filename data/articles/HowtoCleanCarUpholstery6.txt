 A detailer will completely clean your car, cleaning the upholstery, dashboards, vents, windows and other areas. Check with family and friends to find an auto detailer, or search online for one in your area.


Make sure the detailer is certified or trained to use tools and cleaners properly. Also make sure they are insured.
Call around to get an approximate price in order to compare detailers in your area.
 Take your car down to the detailer so they can see how big of a job it will be to clean the car.


The detailer should not give you a price before they have seen your car, however.
 Before you pay and leave, check to make sure the detailer has cleaned your car to your satisfaction.If you have child car seats, make sure these have been removed and the seat underneath has been cleaned.
 Most detailers will likely use commercial cleaners and harsh chemicals to clean your car. If you prefer to stick with environmentally friendly cleaners, see if you can find a detailer who uses these kinds.


Some detailers may try to cut costs by using cheaper cleaning products, which can ultimately be damaging or not as long-lasting as other products.This may be particularly important if you have sensitivities to strong odors or chemical smells, which could potentially linger in the car.
 Detailing can take a minimum of two hours, and will likely take longer if you have several stains or an especially dirty car. Plan other errands to run in the area, or have someone pick you up so that you don’t have to wait around the detailer’s garage.

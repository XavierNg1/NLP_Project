 If you've been keeping the dough in the fridge, make sure to let it warm back up., These should be the perfect size to run through your pasta maker, but be aware the not all machines are created evenly. If you need to cut more, smaller pieces that is okay. This won't affect your final dough., Don't worry about getting it too thin at this stage, just get it started. The pasta machine will take care of the rest., This is usually "1," as most pasta machines get thinner as the setting gets higher. You can usually tell which setting is wide and which is thin -- there is a very visible difference between the settings., This will prevent the dough from getting caught and ripping. You don't nee much, just a light dusting on your fingers will usually take care of any issues., Once you finish the first run, crank the machine up and run it again., If you rip the dough, don't worry too much. Pinch it back together, or cut off a little excess section to patch up the rip. Then run it through the last setting you just used to mend the dough up, proceeding with thinner settings after this.

Depending on what you're making, it is usually okay if some of the dough rips. Filo dough is usually stacked and layered, meaning that only a pretty top layer matters., Keep working upwards on your pasta machine, being sure to handle the dough carefully as it gets thinner and thinner. Make your final pass on "9," or whatever your pasta machine's highest setting is, and then set the dough aside., This prevents the thin dough from drying out or cracking, and prevents the later layers from sticking. Use a cooking brush and liberally apply olive oil. You can now stack each thin layer of dough on top of each other, brushing the tops with oil, until you've thinned all the dough.

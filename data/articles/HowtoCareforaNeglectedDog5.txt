 If you are suspicious that a dog owner may be neglecting his dog, be sure that you understand the situation before you try to do anything. Look for signs that the dog is being neglected. There are some obvious signs of neglect to be on the lookout for:


No shelter
Collar too tight
Lack of grooming
Mange (missing hair, body covered in sores)
Starvation, It is important to be tactful when approaching someone who you suspect is neglecting their dog or you may make the situation worse. You might offend the person or even worse, that person may take out their aggression on their dog. Bring the subject up in casual conversation and don’t accuse them of neglect. Say things like, “I’ve noticed your dog spends a lot of time outside” or ask “how’s your dog doing? He’s such a pretty dog.” Don’t put the person on the offensive.Try to understand their situation before you jump to any conclusions. Poor dog care resulting from poverty is different than malice.
Figure out how you can best help the dog. You may offer to lend a helping hand. You could offer to walk or play with the dog when the owner isn’t around. Or you may need to contact the authorities.
 It is important to report a dog owner who you suspect is neglecting their dog, but the prosecution process can take time. Keep in mind that animal cruelty officers do their best to respond to reports as quickly as possible, but they get a lot of complaints.You can dial 911 and ask to speak with the animal cruelty officer.

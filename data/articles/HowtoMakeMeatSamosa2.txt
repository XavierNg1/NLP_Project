 Take a sheet of the ready made samosa pad or 2 sheets of Filo pastry and make a triangle cone by folding the edges around themselves and sealing the edges with the beaten egg using a pastry brush. Make sure to leave one side open to add the filling.
 Now fill the samosa cone with minced meat. Lift and pinch the corners together and continue along the seam towards the corner. View the video to see how this is done.

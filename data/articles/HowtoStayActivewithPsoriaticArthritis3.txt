 There are many ways lift weights. For instance, you could choose a set of free weights or dumbbells and perform curls. Curls are a common weight-lifting exercise that involves holding the weight in your hand, then bending your arm at the elbow to bring the weight up toward your shoulder. Alternately, you could use a bench press to push a heavy weighted bar up and down. Experiment with a variety of weight-lifting techniques at your local gym in order to discover one you enjoy., To perform a pushup, lay on a soft mat or carpeted area with your belly down. Plant your hands on the ground just to the outsides of your shoulders. Push yourself up and straighten your arms. Straighten your legs and tense your feet so that your toes are pointed straight toward the ground. Keep your back straight and bend your arms at the elbows. When your elbows form a 90-degree angle, push off the ground by driving your arms straight down.When you first begin doing pushups, you will probably only be able to do a few. Try to gradually increase the number of pushups you can do by adding one per week until you are performing a quantity that you feel really challenges you.
 Resistance bands are like large rubber bands that can help you develop strength and stay active with psoriatic arthritis. For instance, you could wrap a resistance band around your thighs. Lift one leg off the ground by moving it laterally away from you. Continue to move it to the side until you cannot move it further. Bring the leg slowly back to the center and repeat on the other leg., Repetitive motions likes chopping, digging, or shoveling are great ways to work your muscles without the need for specialized gym equipment. Of course, youâ€™ll need something to shovel, dig, or chop, so your opportunity to do so will be limited.

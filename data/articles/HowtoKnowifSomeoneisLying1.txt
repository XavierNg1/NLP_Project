 Many liars are suddenly distracted by a need to smooth down their hair, align a pen on the desk, or push in a chair at a table. These actions can be indicators that the person is lying., Someone who is lying might clear their throat more frequently or swallow significantly before answering a question., While many liars are not fidgety, they may still bring their hands to their face. Under the stress of fabricating a story, a liar may experience some level of anxiety. This may cause blood to drain from the extremities, including the ears. Sometimes, this can cause tickling or another sensation, and the individual might bring his hands up to touch the ears., Liars often press their lips together more firmly and frequently when not telling the truth.Sometimes, this might indicate concentration, which a liar often has to have in order to fabricate his story.
 Lying requires more cognitive energy, since the liar needs to concentrate harder while exerting mental energy. People tend to blink less frequently when they are expending cognitive energy, so look for decreased blinking if you think someone is lying.


The same can be said for fidgeting. People often fidget less when they have increased cognitive function such as when they are lying., Many people who are lying tend to stand very still. Some attribute this to the bodyâ€™s reaction to a threatening situation. Similar to the fight-or-flight response, the body stands still, ready to fight.

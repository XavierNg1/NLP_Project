 You might be able to donate using a charitable or other trust to give to the NILC. A charitable trust is “irrevocable,” meaning that once you make the gift you cannot change your mind.You should talk about these options with your estate attorney as well as with the staff at the NILC. For example, consider the following:

You transfer assets to the trust, and the trust pays income to the charity. At the end of a specified period of time, the assets transfer back to you or your beneficiaries.

 Caller ID lets you know who is calling. Numbers that don't have an ID on them could be anyone. 1-800 numbers are never safe, as that code is used by scheming retailers everywhere. If you know that it is a number that is your friend's, put a caller ID on it with your friend's name, instead of being curious whenever getting a call from that number.;
, If you answer it, and it's from a gangster threatening you, call the police. Gangsters are never safe.
 If you get a call, and you left the phone at home, you're not going to be there to answer it, and you don't know who called until you get home and listen to the voice message.
 503 and 541 numbers are from the Oregon area. 702 is from Nevada. Any number you find suspicious should be blocked. You need to also block numbers that allow your children to receive unwanted things that aren't allowed in the house.

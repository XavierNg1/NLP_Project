 You can buy a B-complex supplement that will provide the daily allowance or more of all the B vitamins, or supplements of particular vitamins, like folic acid (B9). In addition, multivitamins usually contain most or all of the B vitamins.
 In some cases, like pregnant women taking folic acid, a supplement is an easy and effective way to ensure adequate consumption of a particular vitamin. But supplements should be just that: supplements. Whole foods are superior in three ways:Foods contain a complex mix of nutrients, which often work together to provide benefits that exceed those of supplements.
Foods like vegetables, grains, fruits, and legumes contain fiber, which is important in preventing heart disease and type 2 diabetes, amongst other problems.
Food contains other helpful substances, like antioxidant and phytochemicals, which fight cell damage and protect against cancer and heart disease.
 Supplements can have side effects, or interact with other medications. You should be particularly cautious if you are pregnant, have a health condition, or are providing supplements to children., Lab analysis has shown that some supplements contain more or less of the vitamin than listed on the label, or contain other unlisted ingredients. To be sure you are getting what the label says, purchase vitamins with a seal of approval from U.S. Pharmacopeia, ConsumerLab or NSF International, three organizations that test vitamins.

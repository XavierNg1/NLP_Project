 White and purple toner works a bit like bleach, except it cancels out any orangery or yellow tones in your hair, and gives it a beautiful silvery tone. You can buy toner from stores such as Hot Topic, although you can probably find it at your local pharmacy also.
 Remember, you want to stay sanitary and keep your hands from getting stained with dye. It’s not recommended to wear the same pair of latex gloves you used to do the bleaching with either.
 This will stop the dye from sticking to your skin or discoloring it. Don’t forget this important step.
 Start at the root and work your way up. You’ll want to make sure each section is covered from root to tip. If you miss a spot you’ll have the bleach color showing up, so try to be thorough. You should keep the dye on your hair for about thirty minutes. For more precise motion you can use a dye brush. , Once the thirty minutes have passed, you’ll want to rinse your hair to get the excess dye out. Enough time should have elapsed for it to absorb the dye. Once you have rinsed your hair, wash it with a color-safe shampoo followed by a color-safe conditioner. These can be bought at your local pharmacy, but you should definitely double check to make sure that they are color safe. You don’t want all your hard work and money to go to waste because you washed your hair with the wrong type of shampoo.

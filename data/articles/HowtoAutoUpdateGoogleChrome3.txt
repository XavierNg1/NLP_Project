 Look for the Play Store app icon (the white suitcase with a Play symbol on it). Tap on it to launch it.
 Tap on the Menu button on the left side of the header to bring out the main menu of the Play Store.


Tap on My Apps, and you will be brought to the screen that lists all your installed apps.
 The apps that have available updates will have the label “Update” beside them. Scroll to see if the Chrome app is one of them.
 You will be taken to its information page.
 Tap on the 3-dot icon at the top right corner of the page. This will bring up a small box with the Auto-update option. Tap on the checkbox beside the option to enable it.


When this is selected, the app will automatically update itself when updates are available. Of course, you need to be connected to the Internet for this to happen.

 If you have enough cards of one theme, like Blue-Eyes or Hieratic, you can opt for building a deck based around that archetype instead.;
, Good ones are Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, Dragon Shrine, Divine Dragon Apocralyph, Silver's Cry, Keeper of the Shrine, Queen Dragun Djinn, Dragon Ravine, Masked Dragon, and Dragon's Mirror.
 For example, if you have a lot of Level 8 monsters, you can use Trade-In. If you have a bunch of LIGHT types, you can run Honest. A lot of dragon support works for normal types, so you may actually benefit from having a few normal monsters in your deck.
 Staples are cards that fit in the majority of decks. Get cards like Twin Twisters/MST, Raigeki, Solemn Warning, Solemn Strike, Call of the Haunted, Dark Hole, and Bottomless Trap Hole.
 Add generic Xyz monsters you can summon. Many Dragon-Types are level 8 and Rank 8 Xyz monsters are very good, so consider building your deck around them. Ranks 7 and 4 are also good. Several Xyz monsters that support dragons are Queen Dragun Djinn, Hieratic Dragon King of Atum, Galaxy-Eyes Dark Matter Dragon, and Dragluon. If you have Tuners, throw in some synchros you can make. There are also good dragon fusions, like Five-Headed Dragon. If you want to use fusions, the best fusion spell card available to you is Dragon's Mirror.
 There are many of them such as 'Saga of the Blue Eyes White Dragon' or 'Dragons Collide'. Your structure deck will be better if you buy three copies of the same one and add all the good cards.

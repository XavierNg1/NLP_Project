 Ancho chile peppers are large red peppers that are most often sold dry. Place the peppers in a large, deep baking dish. Boil 3 cups of water on the stove. When it comes to a boil, pour the water over the peppers, then cover them with a lid. Wait 15 minutes, then test a peppers with a pair of tongs. If it has become soft and limp, it's finished reconstituting. If not, replace the lid and let the peppers sit for another 15 minutes., Once the peppers are soft, remove them from the water bath. Use a sharp knife to cut away the stems, the slice the peppers lengthwise and open them up. Remove the seeds inside the peppers and discard them.
 Place the deseeded peppers in a blender. Add the celery salt, cumin, chicken broth, tomatoes, and oregano. Blend the mixture until it is completely pureed and smooth.
 Heat 1 tablespoon (14.8Â ml) of oil in a large frying pan. When the oil is hot, add the diced onions. Stir them frequently and allow them to cook until they turn translucent, about 5 minutes.


A 10-inch cast iron skillet is a good pan to use for this purpose.
Test to make sure the oil is hot by placing one small piece of onion in the pan; if it sizzles, add the remaining onion.
 Pour the pureed pepper sauce into the hot skillet with the onions. Use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture, incorporating the onions throughout the sauce. Reduce the heat so that the sauce comes to a low simmer. Let it simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.


If the sauce seems to cook down quickly, add 1/2 cup of water or chicken broth.
Taste the sauce to determine whether it needs more salt.

 If you are waiting for a traffic light to change, continue keeping your foot on the brake to prevent your car from rolling. Holding the brake pedal down will ensure that you’re at a complete stop and prevent you from rolling backwards.If you’re going to be stopped for a while, you can shift into neutral. Keep your foot on the brake pedal the entire time.
 If you have chosen to shift into neutral, you’ll now need to shift into drive to move the car forward. You will start to push down on the accelerator pedal as you smoothly release the brake.









While you are moving your foot from the brake to the accelerator, you will need to move your foot quickly to prevent your car from rolling back. It is normal for the car to move back a few inches, but you need to be cognizant of any cars or people behind you while you’re transitioning.
 Preventing rolling back in an automatic transition is more straightforward than with a manual transmission. Now that you’re ready to start again from your complete stop, you’ll have to make the transition smoothly from the brake to the accelerator. Press down about half way on the accelerator, though you will need to step down less if there are other vehicles in front of you.

Depending on how steep the hill is, you may need to step harder on the accelerator than you would on a flat road.

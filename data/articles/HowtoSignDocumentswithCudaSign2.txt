 Go to your app store and search for the CudaSign app. Once you find it, download it onto your device.
 You can get the documents you need to sign from your email app or your cloud app, like Dropbox. Open it.
 Navigate through your emails or your cloud directory until you find the file you need to sign.
 Tap on the file. Most email apps and cloud apps support viewing of document files. If yours does, it will be loaded on your screen.
 On the header toolbar, tap the square icon with an arrow pointing up. This will bring out the menu for sharing. A list of apps that can support the file will be displayed. Swipe through them and tap “Open in CudaSign.”


The document will be opened in CudaSign. You can view it in full screen.
 Read the document and identify the location where you need to sign. Tap on the location. A menu will appear. Select “Insert Signature” from here.
 A signature window will appear. There’s a dotted line where you can place your signature. Use your finger and draw your signature above the dotted line. Tap the “Done” button at the top right corner to save your signature.


There are two pen styles available that you can use to draw your signature. Tap the one you’d like to use from the lower left corner. You can choose between a regular pen and a fountain pen.
You can also select from three different colors to use for your pen. Tap the one you’d like to use from the lower right corner. You can choose among black, blue, and gray.
 Your signature will appear around the location you’ve specified. It might not appear perfectly aligned or sized yet. Tap on it and drag it to the correct position. You’ve now signed your document and it’s ready for export or email.

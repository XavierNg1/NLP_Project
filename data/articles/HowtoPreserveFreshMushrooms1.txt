, If the mushrooms are larger than 1 inch / 2.5 cm across, either slice them, or cut them into quarters.
 Mushrooms can be steamed or heated in fat in a fry pan. The deciding factor might be taste preference, or your desire to keep the mushrooms longer, as steamed mushrooms will keep about three months longer than those cooked in fat.
 Mushrooms that are going to be steamed will retain a better color if they are given an anti-darkening treatment first. To do this, dip the prepared mushrooms for 5 minutes in a solution containing 1 teaspoon lemon juice or 1 1/2 teaspoons of citric acid mixed into a pint of water.
 The steaming time is as follows:


Whole mushrooms - 5 minutes
Buttons or quarters - 3 1/2 minutes
Slices - 3 minutes.
 Drain and package. Leave 1/2 an inch (1.27 cm) of headspace.
 Steamed mushrooms will freeze for up to one year., Heat small quantities of mushrooms in margarine or butter in an open frying pan until almost done. Cool by air or set the pan in which the mushrooms were cooked in cold water. Pack into containers, leaving 1/2-inch / 1.27 cm headspace. Seal and freeze. Fat-fried mushrooms will last for up to nine months in the freezer.

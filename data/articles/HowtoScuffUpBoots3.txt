 You should not use this technique if your boots are very thin or made out of easily damaged material. Look over your boots to see how thick and durable the material is. Real leather boots, like Doc Martens, should be fine., You can do this alone, but it is safer to ask someone to be there with you when you run over the shoes. Ask your friend to stand outside of the car as you run over the shoes. They can tell you to stop if the shoes are being damaged too much., You can use any surface, but a pebbly surface is ideal to use because it creates a nice texture. If you can’t find a pebbly surface, you can place the boots on your driveway or asphalt. Avoid unpaved surfaces, like dirt roads, unless you don’t mind your shoes getting dirty and stained., Do not put the heel or toe boot under the tire because it may crumple under the pressure. Only put the top part of the boot under the tire. Line it up with the tire so you know exactly what you will be driving over.This will not work well if you have boots that don’t have much of a top part, like ankle boots.
 Once you have lined the boots up with your tire, go over the boots back and forth a few times with your car. Get out of the car, inspect the boots, and turn them over to the other side. Repeat on the other side. Then, repeat the process on the other boot.

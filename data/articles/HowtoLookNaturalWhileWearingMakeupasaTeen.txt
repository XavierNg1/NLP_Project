 Cleanse, tone, and moisturize your skin according to your skin type. If you don't have any skin care products, spread warm water around your skin, let it sink in, then splash your face with cold water. Pat your face dry with a towel. Patting your face with a towel decreases the risk of premature wrinkles :( .;
, Dot concealer under your eyes and blend it in with a foam wedge. Also, you could use the warmth of your finger to blend in your concealer by tapping it on your orbital bone. Remember to always have clean hands before, after and throughout makeup application. If you do tend to get oily skin and you find your concealer rubbing off throughout the day add a translucent powder to give it that staying power! :)

, Apply it up to the crease of your eyelid, and blend well. Also if you are looking a bit tired you could add a highlight colour to your inner corners (tear duct areas) to make you look more awake and to brighten up the look.
 If you have brown eyes, use dark brown or black eyeliner. With blue eyes use grey or blue liner, and with green eyes use black.
 If you want, you can add clear mascara to your bottom lashes.
 If you have very light skin, dust bronzer over your cheeks and nose, then use a light pink blush on the apples of your cheeks.
 Nude, peach, pink, and clear shades work well on almost all skin tones.

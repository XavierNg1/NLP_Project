 Cover the blender with its lid.


When making this recipe for the first time, it is best to start with the minimum amount of each ingredient. You can add more of certain ingredients later if you want to alter the taste or texture.
To avoid splashes, place the solid ingredients (the ice and frozen peach slices) in the bottom of the blender. Pour the liquid ingredients on top of that.
If necessary, you could substitute a sparkling white wine for high-quality champagne.
Only use peach nectar. Do not use peach juice, since it is not as sweet and not as thick.
Instead of using peach nectar, you could use fuzzy navel drink mix. When using fuzzy navel drink mix, also add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of sugar.Do not add the sugar if using peach nectar, though.;
, Switch the blender on, setting it to a high speed, and blend the ingredients together for 30 seconds or until they become smooth.


If your blender has a "blend burst" feature, you may need to use it to help crush the ice.
If large ice chunks remain after you blend the drink for a minute or so, turn off the blender and carefully use a spoon or spatula to push the ice further down, toward the blades.
Do not blend the drink for too long. Over-blending the drink can cause it to become too watery.
 Use a spoon or a straw to sample the drink. If you want a stronger peach taste, add more peach schnapps. If you want a stronger alcoholic beverage overall, add more vodka and champagne. You can also add more ice if you would prefer a thicker consistency.


Add up to an additional 1.5 oz (45 ml) peach schnapps, 0.5 oz (15 ml) vodka, and 2 oz (60 ml) champagne.
For a thicker consistency, add up to another 1/2 cup (125 ml) ice.
 As soon as the drink has the taste and consistency you want, you should pour it into one or two servings glasses. Place a straw in each glass and enjoy.


Drink the Wallaby Darned as soon as possible to prevent it from melting and becoming too watery.

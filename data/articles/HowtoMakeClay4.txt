 You will need 1 cup (180 grams) of baking soda and ½ cup (65 grams) of cornstarch. This clay will need to be heated over a stove, so adult supervision is recommended. You do not need to bake this clay, but you will need to finish your piece the same day you have made the clay.
 You will need ¾ cup (168.75 milliliters) of warm water. Stir everything with a whisk until there are no more lumps or clumps.


Consider adding some fine, white or iridescent scrapbooking glitter. Start with 1 teaspoon at a time until it is as glittery as you want it to be.
 Stir your mixture, and do not let it come to a boil. It will start to thicken and become sauce-like.
 The clay is ready when it becomes very thick, like mashed potatoes. Let the dough cool long enough so that you can touch it without burning yourself.
 Your dough is now ready to be formed. You can sculpt little figurines out of it, or roll it out flat and make ornaments.
 Because this clay dries white, it can be used to make some beautiful ornaments. Roll the dough out until it is about ½ to 1 centimeter thick,and cut it into shapes using a craft knife, a cookie cutter, or a drinking glass. Pock a hole near the top of the ornament using a drinking straw or a craft knife.
 The next day, the clay will be a bright white color.

, Turn the heat to medium-low. You want to avoid a skillet that is too hot because it will cook the eggs unevenly.
 (14 g) of unsalted butter into the cast-iron skillet after it is heated. If you are using a non-stick skillet, place the 1 tbsp. (14 g) of unsalted butter into the skillet while it heats up.


You can also use 1 tbsp. (13.5 g) of olive oil or a mixture of olive oil and butter, depending upon the flavor you prefer for your eggs.

 You are less likely to get shells in your fried egg if you crack it on a flat surface. Open the eggshell gently over your buttered skillet.

There are 3 parts of the egg that you need to cook in this process: the yolk, the inner white around the yolk and the outer white. The outer white cooks the fastest, but the inner white takes a while to set.
 It should take 1 to 1.5 minutes for the inner white of the egg to set. Leave the egg until the inner white turns milky and is no longer clear.


If you are cooking 2 eggs, it is likely to take at least 1.5 minutes for the inner white to set on the first side and 35 seconds for the eggs to cook on the other side when flipped.
 Ensure the turner is completely underneath. Flip it quickly but gently, so that you don't break the yolk.
 Turn off the heat on your stove. The remaining heat will cook the egg.
 Flip the egg again and remove the skillet from heat.
 Season with salt and pepper.

, Almost all smartphones being released are Bluetooth capable; just go to the phone settings to activate it.


For laptops, not all have this feature. Check your owner’s manual to see if it’s Bluetooth capable. The feature can be activated either by a dedicated switch along the sides or a keyboard shortcut.
 Make sure that your headset is turned on when you do this.
 Your phone or laptop will ask for a confirmation first before pairing. Pairing your Bluetooth headset with your device allows the two to automatically establish a connection once your device detects your Bluetooth headset.


If a passcode is required, consult your headset’s manual to know the default passcode for it. Normally, the passcode is 0000.
 Once you’ve successfully paired your device with your Bluetooth headset, you can now start listening to music.

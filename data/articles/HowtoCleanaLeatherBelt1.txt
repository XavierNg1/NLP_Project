 For most cleaning, start with a soft cloth dampened with warm water. Wipe down the belt, focusing on any dirty areas.You can also just try a dry cloth if the belt isn't too dirty., Using a cleaner designed for leather is always the best choice. Saddle soap is a traditional leather cleaner, and it will suffice.However, you can also use another cleaner specifically designed for leather, as well.Sometimes, just a little mild soap will do the trick. However, you may not want to use it on a more expensive belt., It can help to start with a very slightly damp cloth. Add a little cleaner.If the cleaner is in a tub, like saddle soap usually is, you may need to rub the cloth in the cleaner to work up a light lather.
 Try to follow the grain, and don't rub too hard. Once you've rubbed it in, use a clean part of the cloth or another lightly damp cloth to wipe up the excess.
 It's best to leave the belt overnight so it has time to absorb all of the polish or cleaner. That way, it will stay on the belt instead of transferring to your hands or clothes, damaging them.

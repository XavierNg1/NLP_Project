 Hang up Christmas lights, hang up the mistletoe. Wrap a present to yourself (the present should be the ring that you hand to your proposed "wife").;
, Don't make things seem grandiose or in any way awkward.
 But don't make the situation seem in any way like you know that you are expecting to propose to her. Leave this box just a little out of sight, in hopes that she doesn't see it too well.
 Make sure to leave the wrapped ring box to the very end, after all other the boxes have been unwrapped.
 As you give the gift to her, keep your hand on the box. After she's "unwrapped" the ring, slide the used wrapping paper out from underneath the box with one of your other fingers on the same hand which is holding the present.
 Tell her that Christmas is the time for lovers to get married.
 Ask her the most important question that comes with any proposal "(Mention her name including her first, middle and maiden name), Will you marry me?"

, If she turns you down, the extravaganza might have been too much. Tone things down and try to re-propose to her in a few weeks; just make sure to keep the love in both of your hearts that you've been experiencing over the past few weeks.
 This will tone things down, but keep the romance going.

 If the amount of cleaning to be done is too much for you, invite a friend or family member to help you. When you work together, it will be more fun and go much faster. This will help it seem less overwhelming too.Make a deal with a friend that if they help you with your cleaning, you’ll help them with theirs. This way you both benefit.
 Get some music that you enjoy and play it on the radio, on your iPod or phone or tune into a music station on the television. There are many websites that stream music for free. Listening to music is a powerful motivator that will help the time pass and make it much more enjoyable, especially if you sing along. You might even forget that you’re cleaning!You can even set your favorite song to play on repeat or make a cleaning playlist that will go through your favorite songs. That way you won’t continually be browsing through songs to find one you like. You can simply hit “play” and focus on cleaning.
 This will definitely make cleaning more enjoyable. For example, you could pick up things of one color or see how much you can pick up in 5 minutes. This will also help you to break your cleaning into more concentrated areas of focus.


Compete with yourself! If it took you a half hour to clean the windows last time, try for twenty minutes this time. By awakening your inner competitor, you will have fun and accomplish more.
 Have a cup of coffee, read a page of a magazine, or pat the cat, then get back to cleaning. Schedule these breaks ahead of time to break up your cleaning into more manageable chunks. If you know that you will straighten your room for a half hour and then enjoy a cup of coffee, time will go faster by making your goal more attainable and your reward imminent.


Make sure your breaks aren’t too long or you will likely remember how much you enjoy not cleaning! You are just looking for a quick break to reenergize yourself and then get right back into it.

 Set it out on the counter for an hour or so, until it's soft enough to be easily spreadable.
 Pour in 1/4 cup of your favorite honey. Add the cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg to the mix, and pour in the vanilla.
 Beat on medium to high speed until the honey butter is light and fluffy, with little specks of cinnamon visible. If you're using a handheld whisk, you'll need to beat for at least 10 minutes to achieve the right consistency.
 Is it spicy enough to suit you? Add more vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg or ginger to adjust to your taste, and beat until they are well incorporated into the mixture. In addition to these spices, consider adding the following spices or flavors:


Ground cloves
Ground lavender
Almond flavoring
Pistachio flavoring.
 Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and keep the honey butter in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. This spicy honey butter is ideal with spicy baked goods, such as fruit loaf, hot cross buns, fruit buns, etc.

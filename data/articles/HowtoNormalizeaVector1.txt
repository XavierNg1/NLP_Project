 The unit vector of a vector A is the vector with the same initial point and direction as A, but with a length of 1 unit. It can be mathematically proven that there is one and only one unit vector for each given vector A.;
, This is the process of identifying the unit vector for a given vector A.
 A bound vector in Cartesian space has its initial point at the origin of the coordinate system, expressed as (0,0) in two dimensions. This allows you to identify a vector solely in terms of its terminal point.
 By restricting ourselves to bound vectors, A = (x, y) where the coordinate pair (x,y) indicates the location of the terminal point for vector A.

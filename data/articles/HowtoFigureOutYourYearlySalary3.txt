 Add any bonuses, commissions or incentive payments you got to the annual salary figure. Many hourly positions have incentive arrangements that add to the hourly wage. For example, you might receive bonuses based on productivity, leadership, or tenure (length of time at the job).Some employers provide a holiday bonus to all employees each year. Sticking with the example in Part 1, imagine you get $200 bonus every year. Your math would look like this: $31,200 + $200 = $31,400.
If you receive a commission or other variable bonuses, you'll need to keep track of them over the course of a year to include them here. For example, imagine you get a $50 bonus every time you reach a certain level of sales. If you get this bonus 12 times over the course of a year, you multiply $50 time 12, getting $600. Sticking with the above example, you would then add $31,400 + $600 to get $32,000.
 If you're paying into your health care or a 401(k), you may want to subtract these costs to get a measure of your "take-home pay."


These amounts are still technically a part of your income. But, they represent money that does not increase your purchasing power.
Look at your pay stub to find out how much is deducted for these expenses each month. To get an annual figure, multiply the monthly payment by 12. Subtract it from your annual income.For example, if health care costs you $150 a month and you're putting $200 into a 401(k), that adds up to $350. $350 x 12 = $4200. Subtract this from your annual salary.
 This will let you figure out your salary before or after taxes.


You'll need to look up where you fall in the federal tax bracket to determine how much you'll pay in federal income tax. Your annual income will determine how much you are taxed. There are online tax bracket calculators that can help you figure this out if you don't know which bracket you are in.Your state tax will depend on where you live. Some states have no income tax. For those that do, it will probably be about 5-6%. You can find your state's income tax rate online.Subtract your income tax percentage from 100%. For example, if you're in the 20% bracket, you'd end up with 80%.
Change this percentage to a decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the left. For example, if you keep 80% of your income, the decimal equivalent would be .80 (or just .8).
Multiply your monthly income by the decimal to get your pay after taxes. You can calculate either your monthly or annual pay in this way.If you make $2800 a month and fall in the 30% tax bracket, your decimal equivalent is .7. Multiply $2800 x 0.7 to get $1960 a month. This is the amount you receive after taxes are taken out.

 This place can be anywhere just so long as it's okay with the owner of the property. Some ideas are: at your house, in a park, in a coffee shop, at a restaurant, or at your church. There are endless possibilities here!;
, The mornings tend to be calmer since the day has not yet begun and a lot of times, there are less people walking about. The afternoons are also nice since you can make it a lunch/bible study if you wish and people can be more awake than in the mornings. The evenings are nice since more people are off work at that time so their schedules are more free than at other times in the day.
 Some Bible studies meet once a week while others meet every day. There are some bible studies that meet for a half an hour while others meet for an hour. Normally, 30 to 45 minutes is a good amount of time to spend getting into the word although don't feel obligated to adjust the amount of time spent in the study.
 You can invite anyone you want to. This group of women can be your friends, people from your church, or even people you don't know well. One of the best ways of doing this is contacting your church and asking them if they would be willing to advertise your Bible study. Another way is to send emails out to anyone you think would be interested.
 Plan out what passages to dive into each time you meet. If no one has any suggestions, then you are more than welcome to use any of the sources provided to develop a plan.

 It’s helpful to have a good calculator at home. If you are in middle school or high school, you should have a scientific calculator. After you complete your work with pencil and paper, you can complete your work on a calculator and compare your answer. Since the calculator will always be right, if your answer doesn’t match, you know you need to work the problem again.

Work through your problems first, and only use the calculator to check your answers. You need to show your work so that your teacher knows you understand how to solve the problems.

If you don’t have a calculator, you can find a number of online calculators by simply searching for them on Google.
 Besides calculators, there are a number of online tools that can check your math work for you. Make sure you try to complete the problems on your own before using these tools.

For algebra, you can use an equation calculator, like Symbolab.For geometry, you can simply type what you are looking for into Google, and a calculator will pop up. For example, if you are finding the area of a triangle, type “area of a triangle” into Google. Then insert your known values into the calculator (such as base and height), and Google will supply the answer.

There are a number of converters online. Math is Fun has a unit converter that can help you convert from one unit of measurement to another, such as inches to centimeters.Convert Me has conversion calculators for most measurements, including speed, temperature, and capacity., Textbooks often have an index in the back that reveals the answers to problems. These are usually organized by Unit, topic, and page number. Often these indexes will only have the answers to odd-numbered problems.

As when using a calculator or online tools, try doing the problems on your own first, then check your answers.

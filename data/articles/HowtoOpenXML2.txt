 While you can use any basic text editor to open an XML file (see above), opening the file in a browser may make it a little easier to navigate. This is because most browsers automatically indent nested tags and allow you to collapse each section of the the XML tree.
 This will let you choose the program you want to use to open the file.
 You can open the XML file in any web browser. Oftentimes, your web browser will already be on the list of suggested programs. If it isn't, you'll need to browse for it on your computer.
 The XML file will open in a new tab in your browser. All of the contents will be displayed, and your browser will automatically indent nested tags. This can make it easier to tell which data belongs to which set.
 The big advantage to using a browser to read XML files is the ability to control what you see. Click the arrows or +/- buttons next to each section to expand or minimize it.

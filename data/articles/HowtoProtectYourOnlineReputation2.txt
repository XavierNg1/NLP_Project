 Consider what effects a simple status update or blog posting could have on your reputation in the long run.


Always ask yourself, "How would I feel if my boss, parents, grandmother, and spouse saw this piece?" Chances are, they probably will see it.
Are you feeling angry, upset, frustrated, or just plain bored? Don't post anything until you feel more balanced and can think straight about what you're writing.
Remember that once it's posted, it can't be taken back. Daring yourself to "just put it out there" can have long-lasting consequences. Go get a glass of water and sit down away from the computer first.
 Approach all online interactions with your manners at the forefront. Have the attitude that most people are acting in good faith and the stupid things said online are often a result of not thinking, making errors or simply having an off-moment. And where people are deliberately provocative, don't stoop to their level; unlike real life heated exchanges, written spats are etched in stone.


Never flame anyone or respond to flamers; it's usually all about them and you're not only feeding their egos but ruining your own reputation at the same time.
Never feed the trolls. Some people love to bait others and watch the destruction unfold. If you don't respond, they'll stop messing about with you and no nasty record will be left online.
Accept where you've slipped up and said stupid things. Where possible, leave an apology. It can go a long way to showing you're capable of realizing and acting on your faults.
Don't harbor ill will toward a person offline. Carrying your annoyance offline is likely to develop into a bad reputation.
Be civil even when you feel uncivil. If this isn't possible, get off the computer until you've cooled down. It is that easy.

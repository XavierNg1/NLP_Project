, There, you’ll find a wide variety of forms for the different mailing services offered by the USPS. Feel free to ask a post office employee if you need help finding the right form — PS Form 3806, in this case.


If you want to skip hunting around for the form at the post office, you can download PS 3806 directly from the USPS website here.
 There are two types: one for domestic registered mail, and another for international mailings. Be sure to review the form carefully before filling it out.


If there’s a long line, it’s best to enter the line while filling out the form. By the time you’ve finished, you’ll have moved along quite a ways.
If the line is short, or if there is no line, fill out the form at the table so you don’t inconvenience the people around you by holding up the line.
 The cost of sending registered mail has risen in the past few years, but will likely be slightly above $10.


The post office accepts cash, credit and debit cards, and checks (with appropriate ID).
The employee should provide you with a receipt of transaction, but if they forget, don’t be too shy to ask for it — it’s the whole reason you’re paying for this service! The receipt will prove exactly when the letter was sent, so you can’t be held accountable if it doesn’t reach its intended recipient.
 The USPS offers insurance up to $25,000 for registered mail. Rates will vary depending on how much insurance you want to purchase.

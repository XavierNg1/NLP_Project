 Some scientists theorize people yawn because of a lack of oxygen. Therefore, taking a few deep breaths when you feel a yawn coming on can help stop it before it starts.


You should breathe through your nose and out through your mouth. This allows the most oxygen to enter and channels the air into your diaphragm.Make sure, when you breath, you pull air into your lower abdomen and stomach rather than your chest.;
, Cooling the body can help suppress a yawn. If you feel a yawn coming on, try having a cold drink.


Try ice water, iced tea or coffee, or cool juice. Soda and carbonated beverages might stop a yawn but they can cause gas and other discomfort.If you're going into a meeting, class, or other activity where yawning would be rude consider bringing a drink with you if it's permitted. Having a bottle of cold water on hand can help you stop a yawn in case one comes on., Colder foods can prevent yawning much in the same way cold drinks can. Try to eat cold foods, like refrigerated fruits, veggies, cheeses, or yogurts. Sugary foods, like ice cream, could actually have the reverse effect as sugar tends to make the body tired. This can cause excess yawning. Stick to healthy choices when it comes to choosing cold foods., If water and food don't do the trick, try a cool compress. Run cool water over a wash cloth or towel and place it against your head. See if you yawn less afterwards.

 Tektites are mostly found on forests or mountain regions. They can be seen roaming around these places freely. Once you find a Tektite, you don’t need to approach it, since it will slowly come closer to you once it spots you.
 Press the “Pause” button on your game controller to open in the game menu. Using the directional arrow keys, look for long-range weapons, like the bow and arrow, boomerang, and bombs from your item list, and press the Action button on your game console controller where you want to assign the item. This will equip the item on that particular Action button. Press the “Pause” button once more to go back to the game.


The same controller buttons can be used to equip items on any Nintendo console.
 Aim your long-range weapon at the Tektite from a safe distance, and fire at the monster to kill it before it even comes close to you. It takes around two arrows, one strike of the boomerang, or one bomb to kill a Tektite.

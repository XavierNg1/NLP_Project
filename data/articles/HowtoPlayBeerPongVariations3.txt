 This one is definitely different. Play with 2 beer pong balls. One is white, one is yellow. One partner shoots the white beer pong ball, the other shoots the yellow beer pong ball. If you make the yellow beer pong ball, you get it right back and retain your turn. You keep getting it back as long as you make it. Teams decide which player wants to throw their money ball. You can rotate back and forth between throwing the white beer pong ball or the money beer pong ball. Whoever is on a roll typically should throw the money beer pong ball.
 Male beer pong players can not blow the beer pong ball out of the cup in the event it is spinning.
 Then they proceed to take off their clothes and streak 1 time around the house/apartment.

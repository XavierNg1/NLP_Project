 Do you want to learn how to create games, or is web development more your style?;
, For game making, it would be beneficial to learn one of the C languages. For web development, you should start with HTML and CSS and move on to whichever server-side language you require, such as Perl or PHP.
 For example, if learning PHP, you will need to download and install a server such as Apache, as well as PHP itself. For a C language, you might have to buy a program, however there are good programs you can get for free to compile a C language.
 Start by the manual for your program, and work your way through the examples. You might try some beginner tutorials.
 Pick something simple. If you're learning how to program games, try an easy game such as a number guessing game.
 You will probably find it difficult and have to reference the manual or tutorials quite often, but it's a start.



Eventually you will have enough of a grasp of the language and its syntax, as well as the "theory" of programming, that you can complete more difficult projects.
 A good mentor will accelerate your learning process and help prevent you from making common mistakes.

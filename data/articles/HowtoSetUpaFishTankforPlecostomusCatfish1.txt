 Pleco catfish can be large, so it’s important to have a tank big enough for their size and how many plecos you want to have. Plecos can be up to 15-24 inches long when they’re fully grown.Your tank should ratio should be 1 gallon of water for one inch of fish.
Pleco catfish live for 20-30 years, so it will take them awhile to reach their full grown size. You can always get a new tank when your pleco reaches its full size.
For many plecos, a 100 gallon tank is the best size tank. This will make sure your pleco has room to grow. Additionally, this size will allow you to add more plecos later.;
, You’ll want to make sure that you have a stand to support your large tank. This will make sure your tank is secured and won’t fall over.Iron and wood stands are the most common type of stands for aquariums. Wood stands are more expensive, but sturdier.
Pur your aquarium stand in a low traffic area to avoid it being knocked over. Keep it out of direct sunlight as well as away from heating or cooling ventilation.
 Use a clean wet cloth to clean the tank before rinsing it. You’ll want to make sure no visible dirt remains on the tank.When cleaning the tank, use a slow, light circular motion. You can damage the tank by cracking or breaking it by using too much pressure when cleaning it.
After cleaning the tank, let the tank dry for a few days. This will make sure nothing grows, including harmful bacteria.

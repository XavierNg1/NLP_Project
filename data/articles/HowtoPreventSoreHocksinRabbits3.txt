 To check if your rabbit has sore hocks, gently hold your bunny on her back so you can see the underside of her back legs. The condition affects the skin on the underside of the hock joint and along the foot. In the early stages all you may see is a lack of fur on the underside of the foot.Due to this lack of fur, the skin may start to thicken into places that look like a callus.
 Another symptom of sore hocks is sore or other irritated places on the feet. If this early stage goes unrecognized, continued pressure on the lower limb wears through the skin and pressure sores develop.


These sores look red and angry at first with the skin surface missing.
 If the missing fur or the sores on the feet go unnoticed, the sores can become infected. This means the sores will develop a sticky discharge or a scab that forms on the lower foot.The very worst cases can have a smelly, purulent infection. When the pus is cleaned away, the skin is lost down to the bone and the subcutaneous structures are exposed.

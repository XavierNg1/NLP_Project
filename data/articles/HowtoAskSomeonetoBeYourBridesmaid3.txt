 Instead of giving your potential bridesmaids a material gift, take them some place nice and ask them there. You can plan a special themed surprise or gift, or just use the opportunity of having everyone together to ask.For example, you could go for a spa day and treat everyone to a special gift, like a pedicure, and ask them then. You might give them all matching robes that say “bridesmaid” on them.
 Invite all your bridesmaids to get together for brunch, lunch, or dinner, your treat. While everyone is together, you can ask them to be your bridesmaid.Consider place cards that say “bridesmaid” on them that you can sit at each person’s seat before you arrive.
 Invite everyone to your home for a fun party. Depending on your tastes, you can have a coffee bar, a tea party, or an ice cream sundae bar. Let everyone make their own tasty treats and eat specially made desserts before you ask them., If you like to cook, you may want to ask your potential bridesmaids with food. Throw an engagement party or just invite them over, and prepare a cookie or cupcake for each woman.You can decorate the cookies with the word “BRIDESMAID” or the question.
Consider putting flags in the cupcakes that say “BRIDESMAID” or asking the question.
 If you want to keep it simple, consider asking the lucky lady in person. You can invite them to your home, visit them, or meet for dinner or coffee. Catch up and enjoy spending time with each other before you ask.

Keep it simple by saying something like, “I have something very important to ask you. Would you like to be my bridesmaid?”

 Line a large baking tray with nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper.
 Combine the two ingredients in a large bowl, stirring thoroughly to blend them into a cohesive glaze.


If the honey is too thick, you may wish to microwave the mixture for five seconds or so to help liquify it. Doing so should make it easier to combine the two ingredients.If you'd like to add more dimension to this recipe, you could try adding both honey and maple syrup; stick with a total of 1/4 cup (60 ml), but vary the proportions according to your own sense of taste., Pour the cashews into the mixing bowl. Stir and toss the cashews in the honey and cayenne mixture to coat them evenly, then transfer the coated cashews to your prepared baking tray.


Make sure to spread the cashews evenly across the baking tray to form one layer. Otherwise, your cashews will not roast evenly; some may burn while others remain too raw.
 Remove the cashews after this time and stir using a large spoon or spatula. This coats your cashews evenly with the sweet and spicy mixture, and promotes even cooking.
 The nuts should smell pleasantly strong and look slightly darkened when finished.


Make sure that you stir the cashews every three to five minutes as they finish cooking. If you cook them without stirring, theyâ€™ll be more likely to burn or cook unevenly.
 Remove the cashews and let cool for five minutes, then sprinkle the warm nuts with the sugar and salt. Toss gently to coat.


It may help to combine the sugar and salt in a small, clean bowl prior to sprinkling the ingredients over the cashews. Mixing them beforehand will make it easier to distribute an even amount of both over the nuts.
 Let the nuts cool fully before serving, or transfer them to an airtight storage container for later enjoyment.These cashews should stay good for about one week when kept at room temperature.

 Put the black probe in the common terminal and the red probe in the terminal marked for measuring volts and ohms.
 You can measure volts DC (direct current), millivolts DC or volts AC (alternating current). If your multimeter has an auto-range function, it's not necessary to select the voltage you're measuring.
 It's not necessary to observe polarity.
 Place the black probe on the negative side of the component and the red probe on the positive side.



If you prefer, you can use the touch-hold feature to keep the reading on the display after you remove the probes. The multimeter will beep each time a new voltage is detected.

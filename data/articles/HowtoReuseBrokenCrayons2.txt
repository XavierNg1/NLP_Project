 Use the same colored crayons. Remove the wrapper on the crayons and chop them up with scissors or a sharp knife. Make the pieces small, around ½ to 1 inch in diameter.Place the chopped crayons in a bowl.
 In a large bowl, combine 3 cups flour, 1 ½ cup salt, and 2 tablespoons cream of tartar. Use a wooden spoon or whisk to combine the dry ingredients., Place a pan on the stove and pour in 2 tablespoons oil. Add the chopped crayons to the pan and stir them until they are completely melted. Use a plastic or metal spoon to stir the crayons., Slowly pour in the water while stirring the crayons. Some crayon types will form a lumpy liquid and others will make a smooth liquid as the water is added. Either way is fine as long as the water is fully combined with the crayons. Stir the mixture well to ensure it is combined., Pour the dry ingredients slowly into the pan and stir it in well. It should form a ball of dough., Take the dough out of the pan and put it on a cutting board or the counter top. Let it cool., Once the dough has cooled, use your hands to knead the dough. Hold the dough between both hands, with your palms flat against the dough. Then, push the dough up against the countertop or the cutting board to knead it. Do this a few times until the dough is smooth and pliable.You should have a smooth ball of modeling clay in a solid color.
Repeat this process with different colored broken crayons to make modeling clay in other colors.

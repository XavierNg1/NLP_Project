 Conceal the puppy in a room with a good door, as far away as possible from where the recipient will be.


A laundry room, basement, or garage can be a good option.
Check on the puppy often.
Play Christmas music to conceal dog sounds.
 Before wrapping up the puppy, take him or her outside! You will want to big reveal to be graceful and clean. Ensure this by letting the puppy take care of business.
 You are going to need a cardboard box much larger than the puppy. Wait as long as you can before sealing up the box.


Poke holes in the box.
Avoid using wrapping paper, as this can be a suffocation hazard. Instead, opt for a simple ribbon or bow.
Bring out the box when you are ready to give the gift!

, If your puppy is larger, or if you simply do not want to deal with a box, you can tie a ribbon or bow onto the puppy's collar.


Wait until the last minute to do it.
Avoid tying anything around his neck.
Simply leave the ribbon-clad puppy in front of the Christmas tree, but beware of him chewing other gifts.
 A third option is to wrap up a box full of dog items (food dishes, toys, etc.). When the recipient opens this box, allow the puppy to run out and great his new friend!

 This example shows use of bronze and white papers for the card. You can vary the colours as per your requirement. Take a more than 160 grams per square meter weight paper (250 gsm paper is used in this example), preferably A4 sheet but you can really use any size you want. Fold it into half and decide which side you want to use as the front of the card.;
, In this case, guidelines are made 2.5 centimeter (1.0Â in) from the edge, leaving enough room for the design to be accommodated.
 Don't use ordinary cello tape as it's hard to remove. Scotch tape comes off easily.



Here is how it will look.



This is how it'll look after finishing.



Make one or two rectangles with this ribbon depending on your preference.
This is how it'll look after you're finished with pasting the ribbons.
 You can use a negative embossing pattern also. In that case, you need to paste it on the back side, much like the angel embossing pattern.
 This is how it'll look from the back as you emboss.


After you're through with embossing, cut out the portions from in between and if you wish to, make a thin border cut.

This is a flower punch.
This is how it looks at the base.
This shows you how it punches a flower out of a paper.
 Using an ordinary paper punch, cut out two small circles of bronze paper and paste them at the centre of the white flower. And that's it. The card is ready!

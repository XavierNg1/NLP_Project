 Remove all extra garments, including indoor coats. Wear only the items that you absolutely need to stay warm. Burying yourself under layers of clothing hides the lines of your body, resulting in a boxy silhouette.


Coats are naturally bulky but can be a necessary layer, so look for one with a cinched belt to carve out an hourglass shape.
 Purchase a v-neck wrap dress with a dynamic and colorful print. The pattern will help to conceal any imperfections and will create a sharp silhouette. Likewise, vertical stripes add curves by flaring out at the bust and hips."Illusion dresses" are form-fitted with two main front panels that may be pale or white, paired with two dark side panels (often black). They are designed to make your waist look smaller and your bust and hip larger in comparison.
 A benefit of the wrap dress is that it is flattering to all figure types. Tying the dress closed at the waist creates the same effect as a cinching belt. Make sure to purchase the right size in a high quality fabric in order to avoid clinginess.
 Wearing heels makes your legs appear longer and leaner while adding contrast and fullness to your hip and backside area. This is especially the case when you wear fitted or tapered garments.


A neutral, or nude, heel is even better as it creates the illusion of the never-ending leg, thus amplifying the slimming effect on the waistline as well., Make an appointment with your local tailor and bring a few favorite clothing pieces with you. Ask them for specific ideas as to how to accentuate your feminine curves using those particular garments.

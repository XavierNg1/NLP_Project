, Climbing is first and probably the most difficult trick for a beginner since the body is probably not used to such actions. But with the passage of time, it becomes easier to climb the silk.


When you are pulling the silk, your arm should be sturdy and firm. Your grip on the silk should be stable so that you can concentrate on the movement of your lower limbs.
 That way it won't slip, and you're not supporting yourself with just your arms. This requires a lot practice and stamina because it also involves your mental strength.
 You will want to remain near the ground until you've mastered the techniques.
 The basic move is easier to practice on the ground. Wrap your lower leg around the silk as if you were going to climb. Pull some slack out of the silk from about mid-shin, and loop it under your foot so it looks like you're wearing a shoe. Your toes and heel should not be in the silk.
 When coming down from a climb, walk yourself down slowly, hand over hand. If you slide down, you'll get painful second-degree burns on the top of your feet. Also, don't let go until you're at least only a foot off the ground.

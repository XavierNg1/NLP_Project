 Pretend they’re standing right there in front of you.Build their face and body in your mind’s eye. Start with the basics: hair color, eye color, height, weight, etc. Then add more distinct features that make them unique, like a snaggle-tooth, a freckle pattern, or a faded scar


If you need to, use photos or other images of random people for inspiration.
Resist basing your imaginary partner on someone whom you know personally. You may end up feeling guilty, frustrated, and confused when they don’t act like your imaginary partner.
 Give them a name. Come up with other basic information about them, like their birthday. Think of answers to typical questions that people ask each other when they first meet, like:Where did they grow up?
Where do they live now?
Where do they work or go to school?
Do they have any siblings?

, Imagine their personal history. You know the name of their hometown–now ask yourself what happened to them there. Fill in the details of their background, such as:


Were their parents ever married? Are they divorced?
What sort of friends did they have growing up?
What were they like in school?
What sort of interests and activities did they pursue?
What if any religion were they brought up in?

, Build an inner life for them. Give your imaginary partner their own imagination and tastes. Ask yourself what sort of thoughts occupy them now:What are their current interests?
What are their hopes and dreams?
What do they worry about?
What do they wonder about?
What values and beliefs do they hold dear?

, As you build their inner life with their own wants, needs, and beliefs, measure yourself by their standards. Imagine what they see in you. Ask yourself what it is about you that sets you apart from everyone else in their eyes.What do you both believe in?
Where do you disagree?
What needs of theirs can you fulfill?

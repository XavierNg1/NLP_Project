 You might even mix them.
 Bend the hand from around the middle to form a slight U-shape hook. Keep the hook slightly facing outward––don't press too far back toward the cutlery.


Whether you bend toward the front of the fork or spoon, or away from it, will depend on your preference for the final look, as well as whether the base of the cutlery has a monogram you'd like to show. If you bend to face the front of the spoon or fork, a monogram at the base of the handle will be hidden, whereas if you bend the hook toward the back of the fork or spoon, the monogram will show up clearly on the outside of the hook. This is much better where you want the monogram to feature.
 The hooks should be located for ease of use, such as near the stove, above a work space, over the sink, etc.
, Attach each utensil hook with a screw. (Or use liquid nails if you're not drilling.)


Slide a small screw or nail through the hole and center the piece on the surface or wall. You could use a pencil to place a small hole on the surface before screwing it in to ensure you mount it in the right place.

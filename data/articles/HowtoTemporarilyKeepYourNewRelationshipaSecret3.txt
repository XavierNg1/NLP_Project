 There are many reasons people keep their relationship secret. However, no matter your reasons, eventually the relationship should become public, especially if you are getting serious. Talk to your partner about finding a time to go public with your relationship.You don’t have to make a huge announcement on social media or turn it into a big deal. You may just let your friends know you’re dating someone or tell your friends you have a new partner.
Instead of telling anyone, you can just start going on dates around town where anyone can see you.
 Despite your best efforts, you may not have been as sneaky as you thought with your relationship. People may suspect that you are together or may have seen you together. If a few people know, more people probably know. This means you should probably go public since the relationship isn’t private anymore.If someone figures it out and asks you, avoid lying if you can. Lying about the relationship can cause a lot of problems and trust issues with family and friends after you go public.
 Sometimes, people want to keep the relationship secret because they don’t want a relationship, they want to use you, or they are interested or with another person. If your partner doesn’t want to go public, even after you have been together for awhile, you should question their motives to make sure you aren’t being taken advantage of.Let your partner know what you need from the relationship. You cannot truly have a fulfilling relationship if you are not part of each other’s lives.
If your partner refuses to go public, consider ending the relationship and finding someone who will want to be part of your life.

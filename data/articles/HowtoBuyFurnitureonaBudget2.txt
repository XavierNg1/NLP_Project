 There are a variety of sites at your disposal to find individuals in your area who are looking to sell their used furniture. Sites like Craigslist or Freecycle organize vendors by location and let you see what items are available near you. To purchase something from these sites, just contact the vendor and agree on a time, place, and payment method. Bring a vehicle that can transport the furniture.
 Sites like Amazon or eBay receive their inventories from many different vendors, meaning they have a variety of styles and prices to choose from.While you will not be able to inspect the item in person, you can rely off of user reviews left by people who have bought and used it before.
 Shopping online is a great way to find cheaper deals, but take some time to compare prices with the furniture that you could buy directly from a retailer in your area. By sampling the prices at a few stores, you can figure out how much something is worth and how much would save by purchasing it elsewhere.

 Begin with dry, clean hair. Carefully brush the hair until it is smooth. Pay particular attention to removing any snarls or knots., Brush the hair forwards towards the forehead. Gather the hair into a ponytail at the base of the forehead. Secure it tightly with a rubber band.If you are cutting a client’s hair, have them sit in a chair. #*If you are cutting your own hair, bend forward at your waist.
Imagine that you are transforming your hair into a unicorn’s horn. The ponytail should be located in the same place as a unicorn’s horn.
 Slowly slide the rubber band towards the ends of the hair. Stop 1 to 2 inches from the ends of the hair. Adjust the rubber band to the desired length—remember, it is always better to cut a little bit off at a time!If you are cutting your own hair, remain bent over at your waist.
 Position your non-dominant hand securely over the rubberband. Using a pair of sharp shears, cut just below the rubber band. Set down the hair you cut off and assess the layered look. If you or the client want to cut off more hair, repeat the process.If you are cutting your own hair, stand up straight and try not to shift your hair or the position of your hand.

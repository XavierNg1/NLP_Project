 When you buy your plant, it may be in a small container with a dome cover. You might think about moving it to a larger terrarium just in case you want add more plants later. The domes are not needed but the plant may need to be slowly acclimated to the outside humidity. Remove them slowly. If the nursery can sell exotic tropical plants with no domes, they should sell North CarolinaÂ´s own Venus flytrap without them as well.;
, Most experts recommend a potting mixture of 60% peat moss and 40% perlite, or clean sand. You can now add your plant to the pot.
 If you are growing in sphagnum moss then you don't need to water as much because of water retention, but that does not mean let it get dry. Water from the bottom only.
 Some species do best in indirect light, but most thrive in full sun-as much as possible. Venus flytraps and most, if not all, other north American carnivores should bask in as much sun as you can give them. DO NOT place plants that still have a dome over them in the direct sun.

 You are not permanently the "new kid". When you first arrive, everyone tries to get to know you. This is normal.;
, Be yourself, and you will end up with friends who like you for who you are, not someone you're pretending to be.
 Start engaging in others' activities or groups. Don't just walk up and start talking, though. This can be taken as weird or desperate.
 An appropriate example would be like this: Let's say a kid does a presentation on 'Minecraft'. If your interests are similar, don't stress, but also don't miss the opportunity to talk to him/her. You can say something along the lines of "Your presentation was really good!" When they reply, continue the conversation. If you and that person get along, congratulations! You've made a friend! Continue trying to build friendships. The more friendships you build, the better network of friends you have, making your life a bit easier, as almost everywhere you go in the school there should be at least one person you know.
, Although people will be interested in you and ask you questions, don't just go letting out every secret of yours - ask them about themselves.
 They listened to you, so you should return the favor.



Try not to be too negative. Instead of, "Ugh, oh my gosh, I hate my parents. They never let me do anything." say something like this: "Man, I wish my parents would let me do more". The first sentence makes you sound stressed, rude, and overall just a mad person, but the second sentence seems a bit less negative. People always prefer to be friends with positive people!

, Start off with a clean slate!


Don't show anger or jealousy towards other students. Have respect for even the meanest student. Always keep a nice face, and not a frowning, squinted face. Squinting makes you look unapproachable and rude.
If you don't know about a subject, don't talk about it! It's really annoying when people try to act like they know about something when they actually don't.
Be honest. If you lie, someone will find out eventually, and it will just make possible new friends think you are a dishonest person, and they won't want to be friends with you anymore.
Be nice and caring to everyone. Always make peace and do not start drama.

 Leather conditioners help hydrate your cowhide, leaving it less susceptible to cracking. Some leather conditioners even tout the ability to form a seal over the leather which keeps stains — ink and otherwise — from embedding itself too far into the leather.
 There are plenty of things that you can do to better care for your leather, apart from giving it a good moisturizing bath every now and then. Because ultimately, a better cared-for piece of leather is a cleaner piece of leather. And a cleaner piece of leather is one you'll be less likely to spill ink on.

 You do not want the car to roll or sink once you have it jacked up.
 It is important to remember to loosen, or break, the lug nuts before you jack up the vehicle. This way the weight of the vehicle is still on the wheels and it prevents them from spinning dangerously while you turn the lugs.
 Once the lugs have been loosened, it will be necessary to jack the care up so that the wheels can be removed. As mentioned above, this should be done on level concrete or some other hard, level surface. Some important things to remember when jacking up the care are:


Your service manual will recommend jacking points
The most common way to elevate the car is a floor jack, or trolley jack. If you are unsure how to use one visit Lift a Car Using a Trolley Jack.
You should use jack stands to stabilize the car. A good tutorial on jack stands can be found at Use Jack Stands.
If you have access to a hydraulic lift it will save you time.
 At this point, the lugs may be loose enough to remove by hand. If not, finish removing the lugs with the lug wrench or impact wrench. Once the lugs are removed, pull the wheel off of the wheelbase. If you are uncomfortable removing a wheel, read about how to Remove Lug Nuts and Tires.
 You can use a small kiddie pool, bathtub, or any other container large enough to hold the tire. You should add water until the tire is completely submerged and then allow the water to settle.
 Once the water has settled you might notice air bubbles escaping from the tire. If so, you have found your leak.

 This provides a protective cover that you can work on top of.
 This will prevent the fondant from sticking to the plastic sheet.
 For each part of the motif and each fondant color, always roll the fondant into a ball, then press down into the motif template area. The size of the ball will vary depending on how much fondant each part of the motif requires; you'll get better at estimating this with practice.


Always work on the back pieces first, leaving the front pieces (such as eyes, whiskers, noses, etc. until last). For example, if you're making a cat motif, the cat's body, tail and head will likely be shaped first, then paws and then add on the ears, eyes, whiskers and nose.
In general, the middle of each piece of fondant should be higher than the sides, which will usually be smoothed into the joining pieces.
 Then move onto the next layer of pieces and continue in this manner until all the elements have been added in an appropriate order.


Use the shape suggestions from the section above to guide how you make and change the shapes.
Leave the small details until last.
If you want the motif to appear shiny, brush on a tiny amount of vegetable oil.
 Slip this under the motif with care, making sure to lift up all of the motif before lifting off the plastic sheet. Have the cake already sitting next to the motif workspace and quickly but carefully move the motif across and onto the exact position on the cake.
If both the cake fondant and the motif fondant have dried, use fresh icing/confectioners sugar or a brush of water to "glue" in place. If the motif is still fresh, it will usually adhere on its own.

 In English, you use the same word whether you're actually saying goodbye to someone or talking about saying goodbye. Spanish has a different word you should use if you're talking about saying goodbye.The noun form of goodbye in Spanish is "la despedida." For example, you might say "Supongo que es la despedida," or "I guess this is goodbye."
If you're talking about someone "saying goodbye" to something, use the word despedirse. For example, "puede despedirse del triunfo" means "he can say goodbye to his chances of winning."

, In English, rather than saying goodbye specifically, you often tell the person to take care of themselves. The word cuídate in Spanish expresses the same thing.As in English, you also can combine this with other greetings. For example, you might say "¡Te veo, cuídate!" meaning "See ya, take care!"

, As in English, it's fairly common for Spanish speakers to say "have a nice day" rather than just "goodbye" or "see you later." A way to say this in Spanish is "¡Bueno, que tengas un buen día!", In Spanish-speaking countries, it is a cultural tradition to greet others as well as say goodbye with a kiss on the cheek. In Latin America, people usually give each other one kiss on opposite cheeks. In Spain, two kisses – one on each cheek – are common.If you are in a Spanish-speaking country, don't be taken aback if a stranger or someone you've just met kisses you goodbye. It's a basic cultural expression.

 Since you won’t be connected to a central water system, you’ll need to use well water. Getting a well drilled will cost somewhere in the neighborhood of around $7,000.
 A septic tank is a watertight chamber that collects sewage in the absence of a sewer system. Having a septic tank installed generally costs around $5,000.The septic tank will need to be emptied by a vacuum truck periodically.
 A greywater system will treat water used in dishwashing, sinks, showers, and baths so that it can be used again. While it’s less of a necessity than a septic tank or a well, greywater systems can extend the lifetime of your well by allowing you to use water that has already been pumped up to the surface.Recycled greywater can be used as irrigation, bathing, or toilet water.

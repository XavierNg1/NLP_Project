 Most people do not actually know what the Supreme Court decided on January 22, 1973. They assume that the Court legalized abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy only, and that it is subject to the limits and regulations today. You will be able to change minds when you inform them that neither of these assumptions is true.


The Court ruled that abortion must be permitted for any reason a woman chooses until the child becomes viable; after viability, an abortion must still be permitted if an abortion doctor deems the abortion necessary to protect a woman's "health,"Essentially, Roe created an absolute right to abortion under which any abortion can be justified. Cite statistics to show that only a minority of Americans agree with Roe:

61% of Americans say abortion should be illegal after the fetal heartbeat has begun,which occurs in the first month of pregnancy.
86% of Americans say abortion should be illegal after the first 6 months of pregnancy.Only 6% -17% of Americans believe abortion should be legal at any time, under all circumstances.The law clerk of Justice Blackmun, the Justice who authored the Roe v. Wade opinion, calls it "one of the most intellectually suspect constitutional decisions of the modern era."Even the extreme left justice Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been critical of Roe, saying that it "ventured too far in the change it ordered and presented an incomplete justification for its action"and that the Roe decision was "not the way courts generally work."

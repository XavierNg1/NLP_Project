 Use a blow dryer on its highest setting and dry the sticker for 1 to 2 minutes. Or you can place the object in the sun for a couple of hours. The heat should melt the adhesive, but the sticker should be promptly removed or the adhesive might cool off again and harden.


If you're trying to get a sticker off a window of your car, park your car in a very sunny place for 2 to 3 hours.
Heat a glass or plastic item with hot water. Wait 15 seconds or so. If the label is on a flat surface like a lid, for example, run the hot water on the opposite side of the label while peeling off the label.
 Use your fingers to gently lift the sticker off. Be careful, the surface will be extremely hot. Alternatively, use a dull knife to scrape off the sticker by gently prying a corner of the sticker off, then wedging the blade between the sticker and glass until it is completely removed.


Be sure to pick a knife that is dull and not sharp to touch. Dull knives have been through wear and tear so when you use it on a glass surface, you won't run the risk of scratching the surface.
 There may be some remaining sticky residue for stubborn stickers and extra steps may need to be taken.

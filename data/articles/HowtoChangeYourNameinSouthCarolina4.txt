 A petition for the name change of a child in South Carolina must be initiated by one of the child’s parents. The other parent must be named as a party in the action.


If there is not another living parent, the child must be named as a party in the action., Since you are the petitioner in the action, the appropriate court to hear your case is the one with jurisdiction over the area where you live.
 Even if both parents agree on the name change, South Carolina law requires the court to appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the best interests of the child at the name change hearing.


The guardian will interview the child and review the child’s circumstances and living environment.
Most guardians ad litem charge between $150 and $175 an hour for their services. Provided the name change isn’t contested by anyone, expect your child’s guardian to spend between two and three hours on the case., South Carolina requires hearings for all petitions to change a child’s name. The judge will review the petition and hear testimony from the parents and the guardian ad litem to discern whether it is in the best interests of the child to grant the petition.


The judge considers factors such as the length of time the child has used her present name, the motives of the parents and the reason for the name change, the possibility of the name change causing the child insecurity, difficulty, harassment, or lack of identity, and the preference of the child if the child is old enough to express a preference., Once the judge has signed the order, a certified copy of that order will be sufficient to have the child’s name changed with the Social Security Administration.
 After the order is final, you’ll want to have the child’s name changed on school records, at doctor’s offices, and anywhere else that has a record of the child.

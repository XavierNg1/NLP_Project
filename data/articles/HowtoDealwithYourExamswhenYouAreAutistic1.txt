 Don't wait until two days before the exam to ask for help. Talk to your school's disability specialist or disability office at the beginning of the school year. This way, there will be plenty of time to get everything in order, and you can focus on studying by the time of your first exam.


If you are in college, you will be expected to advocate for yourself, instead of having your parents/guardians handle it. The disability office can help walk you through the needed steps.;
, Depending on your school, you will need some sort of proof of your disability. This may mean making an appointment with a general doctor or a specialist, who can write a note.


If you have gotten accommodations at this school in previous years, you most likely will not need to bring in any more proof.
 Accommodations are meant to help you focus and feel less stressed; they are intended to "level the playing field."


Extended time (1.5 or 2 times the allotted time)
Ear plugs/ear defenders
Private room; this can limit distractions, and allow you to stim freely without worrying that you will disturb others
Stim toys (tangles, gum, etc.)
A reader to read questions out loud
Weighted lap pad or blanket for deep pressure
Supervised rest breaks during the exam

, They can help you figure out how to get what you need. You may be doing this for the first time, but they have plenty of experience, so they can help you through the process of getting accommodations.


Starting early makes things easier on them. They will be happy to see you being proactive.

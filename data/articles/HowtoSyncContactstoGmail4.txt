 You can also manually add contacts directly to Gmail. To do this, open your Gmail inbox and click on the Gmail menu located in the top left under the Google logo and above COMPOSE. Click on Contacts in the menu that drops down.
 Click Save now in the upper right to save your contact. If Saved appears in the upper right instead and cannot be clicked, your contact was automatically saved.

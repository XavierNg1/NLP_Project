 Locate and tap the app’s icon from your phone or tablet’s home screen or app drawer to open it.


If you don’t have Google Maps on your device, you can download it from Google Play (for Android) or from the iTunes App Store (for iOS).
 If this is your first time opening the app, you will be required to log into your Google account. Enter your Google account details (email address and password) to sign in. After logging in, a map of your current location (based from the network data of your mobile device) will be shown on the app screen.


If you don’t have a Google account yet, simply tap the “Create an account” link found on the welcome screen of the app and enter your full name, user name of choice, and password to get an account instantly.
 Enter the name of the destination in the search bar at the top of the app screen, and tap “Enter” on your device keyboard to quickly navigate to that certain area.
 Tap the menu button (found at the top left corner of the screen for the Android version and bottom right corner for the iOS version) to open Google Map app’s menu panel.


Select “Traffic” from the menu panel, and you’ll see four colored lines appear on the map: green, yellow, orange, and red. Roads with green lines indicate fast moving traffic while red ones indicate slow traffic.

 You want to work towards having a 'J' shape in your dogs leash at all times when walking. This avoids tension in the leash. Tension can lead to 'leash reactivity' or 'leash aggression'.;
, If he is excited now, will he get calmer outside? Nope! And an excited dog will pull you- plus it's a small step from hyper excitement to aggression. A calm dog is a responsive dog. If your dog gets excited when you put on your shoes or coat, do this randomly throughout the day without going for a walk until your dog no longer reacts to it. Do the same with your dogs leash until you can clip your leash on a quiet dog. When you can clip the leash on, unclip it and go back to what you were doing. When your dog is calm and quiet through all this, you can now tackle the front door.
 Repeat until you can reach the front door with a relaxed leash.
 Reach out and touch the door handle. If he stayed, give him a treat. Repeat until he is calm. Then wiggle the door handle. Repeat until he is calm. Open the door a little and then close it. Repeat until he is calm. Continue until you can fully open the door.
 Return to your dog and reward him. When he is calm for this step, then call him to you when you are outside. Have him sit. Reward him. If he is excited, go back inside and repeat until he is calm.
 Tell him 'lets go' and step forward. If he leaps ahead of you, simply abruptly turn and walk the other way. His punishment for pulling is simply to go back the other way. Repeat. A lot! Until you have a 'J' shape in the leash.
 Allow him to move around you a little but 'punish' tension in the leash with either a change of direction or by stopping all together (wait for a loose leash and eye contact before continuing). Keeping your dog close to your side is a different command ('Heel') and should only be used for short periods- remember the walk is about exercise AND stimulation for your dog. Letting him move around a bit and sniff will enrich his life- it's an important natural behaviour.

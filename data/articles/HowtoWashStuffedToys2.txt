 Washing a toy in a sink or bathtub is safer than machine washing, but there are some toys that should not be submerged in water:


Toys with electrical components that cannot be fully removed
Toys filled with foam, fiberfill, or paper stiffeners
Fragile toys with tears or wear from extremely heavy use
Leather toys

, Fill a tub, clean sink, or bathtub with cold water. Submerge the toy and squeeze, then lift it and squeeze out the water again. Repeat two or three times. This will remove light surface grime.
 Add a spoonful or two of mild laundry detergent or shampoo to the water and stir to make suds.
 Use a clean toothbrush or stiff-bristled brush to scrub the dirt from the toy. Squeeze out the suds periodically.


This may work best if you squeeze the toy while partially submerged, so some air and suds get into it as well as water.
 Squeeze the toy to remove most of the water, but do not twist or wring it. Hang the toy up to drip dry, then put it on a towel to air dry for several days.

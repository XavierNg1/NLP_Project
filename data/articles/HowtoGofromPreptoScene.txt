 Also shop online at Amazon or eBay, you can find great deals there on almost anything. Buy stuff like black, grey, soft pink, neon cheetah spotted, or zebra print skinny jeans, plaid miniskirts and tutus, graphic and band tees, neon tank tops and tube tops, converse, and vans.;
, Go easy on the accessories, though. Maybe just some bright silly-bands, gauges or rainbow earrings. Continue to dress more and more scene every week, by adding accessories, and more outrageous clothing choices. Within a month your scene style should be complete.
 Go to the salon and ask for razored, choppy layers especially at the crown area, and bangs (either side bangs or straight across.) for the first couple months, leave it your natural hair color. Then if your parents will let you, dye your hair any color or colors you want. If they don't let you, ask about getting extensions. But if you don't want to, that's fine. Also, for the first week into your new hairstyle don't tease it. Then the next week you can tease it a little, then the next week even more, and so on.
 When you were preppy, you probably listened to rap, pop, and hip hop. Well, for scene, this music is also quite good. But also try music like Blood on the Dance Floor, Millionaires, 3!OH3, Owl City and I Set My Friends on Fire.

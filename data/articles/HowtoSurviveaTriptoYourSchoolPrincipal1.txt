 Taking small, shallow breaths when you're nervous or stressed can lead to more anxiety. Deep breathing can help calm you down and relax your nerves before you have to go the principal. Take deep breaths in through your nose and exhale through your mouth if you're feeling nervous., If you're overwhelmed and have no one to talk to, you can talk to yourself to calm yourself down. Saying things like "Okay, I'm not responsible for this" or "I'll get through this" may allow you to relax.Keep repeating these things to yourself as you walk down the halls to your principal's office.
 You don't want to go to the principal without having any story at all. Think about the reasons why you may be in trouble and determine if you're really responsible for what happened. The reason you're getting sent to the principal may have been a misunderstanding. Think about the situation and evaluate all the details before walking into the principal's office., When you get called down the principal, you can take your time to get there. Unless there was a serious situation, your teacher will send you to the office or it'll be announced on the loudspeaker. Taking your time and walking slowly will allow you to get all the facts of your story straight and will give you the time to calm down if you're stressed., There's no way to tell what your punishment will be, or if there will be a punishment at all. Therefore, there's no reason to obsess over what might happen. Instead of focusing on the outcome of your meeting with the principal, concentrate on getting all of your facts correct and work on breathing and relaxing.

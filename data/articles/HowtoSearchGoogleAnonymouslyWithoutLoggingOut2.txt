 This method works if you use Mozilla Firefox as your web browser. Look for it on your computer and open it.
 Click the button with three horizontal bars on the upper right corner of the browser. This will bring down the main menu.
 The Add-ons Manager will load in a new tab or window. You can also directly get to this page by entering about:addons on the address bar. The Add-ons Manager is where you search for and download add-ons for Firefox.
 You will remain logged into the other Google services, but when you reach Google Search, you will technically be logged out. Enter “Searchonymous” in the search field on the top right corner.
 Searchonymous should be one of the top hits in your results. Find it and click the “Install” button for it. The add-on will be installed in Firefox and it will run in background.
 Enter google.com in the address bar to open the Google Search page. You can now safely and privately search Google anonymously.

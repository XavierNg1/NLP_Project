 In the moment, recognize that the ring does not match your personal tastes. Internally acknowledge your feelings of disappointment and dissatisfaction â€” these feelings are okay and you don't need to panic. Choose to not react to these feelings of disappointment and dissatisfaction, but to respond instead.Respond by resolving to take the best course of action based on logic or reason, cooperation, and compassion.
Say to yourself, for example, "I feel disappointed that the ring doesn't match my personal tastes. But, I love the person in front me and all that matters right now is our happiness.";
, Take a deep breath and allow any tension to leave your body. Gather your thoughts. Let your feelings rise and then decrease in intensity. Remember that you do not have to react immediately because of an internal feeling.By taking a second to pause, you can avoid reacting negatively, such as making a face or accidentally saying something hurtful.
Smile. Even a slight smile can signal your body to relax and soften.
 Remember that you are marrying the person, not the ring. Focus on the fact that the person you love has asked you to marry them, which is a cause for celebration no matter what the ring looks like.React to these feelings instead of the feelings that you have about the ring.
If your partner asks you if you like the ring in the moment, you can say "It's a beautiful ring" and worry about it later, instead allowing yourself to relish the happy moment. Later on you might say something like, "You know, I've been thinking about it, and this ring doesn't totally feel like 'me.'"
Or you can hint at the fact that you might prefer a different setting or band. You can say, for example, "I like the ring and I love you, but I think I would prefer a different setting." If you choose this route, it may ruin the moment so be prepared to comfort and support your partner. It might be best to wait a few days and just focus on the happy occasion.

 If you plan to make a planter box with more complexity, you may need additional tools to cut and assemble the planter box. This is a simple design for anyone beginning to learn how to make a planter box.;
, All sides of the boards should be inspected. The most attractive side is the surface you want on to be the outer side of the planter box.
 The holes should be 3/4 inch (1.91 cm) from the edge. The middle hole is centered with the board's width.


The 2 boards are pre-drilled so that when the screws are inserted the wood does not splinter when assembling the planter box. It is unnecessary to predrill the other 2 boards.
 The boards with pre-drilled holes are positioned on the outside of the corners. The screw will go through the pre-drilled hole into the adjoining board.
,, If the box is too out of square, the wood can split because of stress on the corners.
 The bed can be moved to another location if desired.
 This step is optional if there is a desire for the planter box to be in a fixed position.
 The newspapers prevent weeds from emerging in the garden. Dead leaves or other materials can be used in place of newspapers.
 Mix the compost and potting soil while filling the box. The box should be filled with 1 inch (2.54 cm) of space between the mix and the top of the box.

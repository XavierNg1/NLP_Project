 Do an Internet search on "low interest rate credit cards" or "zero percent introductory rate credit cards" or "no annual fee credit cards." Once approved, it is easy to make a balance transfer from your current high interest cards.If you keep your credit score high (over 690) by paying all your bills on time, you will get a lower interest rate.
Check the interest rates on cards with your bank or credit union if you have been a good customer.
 You will pay your cards off quicker and it will improve your credit score if you can add at least $10 to the minimum amount owed each month. Once you pay a card off, add that former payment amount to another card's payment to quickly pay down another high interest card.


Be sure you make minimum payments on all credit cards to protect your credit score, but add extra payments to the highest interest cards.
 If you have a credit score of at least 690 you will probably receive offers in the mail for zero interest credit cards for a year or more. Once approved, transfer your high interest cards to a zero interest card. Try to pay them off before the end of the zero interest time period.

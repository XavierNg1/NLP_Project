 Silica gel is an agent that can help you dry your flowers quickly and efficiently in the microwave. Cover the bottom of a microwave-safe container with one or two inches of silica gel and place the flowers, blossoms-up, into it. Gently pour a little more gel over the blooms and stems. Place the uncovered container into the microwave.Silica gel can be obtained at any craft store. It tends to be on the pricy side, so this method isn’t as budget-friendly as air drying., The time and temperatures required will vary, so you may want to experiment with a few flowers first. Begin with one or two heat levels above defrost and set the time for two to five minutes. Check their progress intermittently and make adjustments as necessary.In general, fleshier flowers (like roses) will require more heat than delicate ones (such as daisies).
 After the flowers are dry, open the microwave and cover the container right away. Then take the container out of the microwave and let the flowers sit for 24 hours. Use a fine-bristled paint brush to gently brush away the silica gel from the blooms.Spray the flowers with an acrylic spray, which can also be obtained at craft stores. Once the acrylic spray has fully dried, your flowers are ready to use.
Store them or display them out of direct sunlight and away from high heat.
 Mix equal parts vegetable glycerin and water in a tall, sturdy container. The mixture should fill the container to about three inches. Place the stems of the flowers into the mixture – don’t immerse the blooms themselves, just the stems. Leave them in the solution for two weeks. Remove them and allow them to drain on newspaper.The flowers are ready to use in a bouquet after draining and drying completely.
This method is unique because the foliage remains pliable after the drying process is complete.

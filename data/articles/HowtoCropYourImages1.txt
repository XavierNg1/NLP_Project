 It's impossible to just crop an image while on the internet; in order to successfully crop an image, you'll need to save the image onto your disk, open it using a picture-formatting or word processing program, and manipulate it there. The following are programs that you can use to crop an image:


Preview
Adobe Photoshop
Adobe Illustrator
Microsoft Word
Many more;
, You can crop the long way — going into a menu and finding the crop tool — or by pressing a couple buttons on your keyboard. Note: the keyboard shortcuts for these following software programs are all different; there is no uniform crop command.


Shortcut for Preview: "command + k"
Shortcut for Adobe Photoshop: "c"
Shortcut for Adobe Illustrator: "Alt + c + o"

, It's not the most ideal way of cropping, but it will get you where you need to be. If a shortcut for the program you're using doesn't work, try cropping using the following methods:


Preview: Click and drag the portion you want cropped, then navigate to Tools → Crop.
Adobe Photoshop: Select the crop tool, click and drag the portion you want cropped, and press Enter/Return on the keyboard or Commit.

Adobe Illustrator: Click and drag the portion you want cropped, then navigate to Object → Clipping Mask → Make.
Microsoft Word: Select the picture you want cropped, click on the Crop tool in the Picture toolbar, and drag over the area you want cropped.

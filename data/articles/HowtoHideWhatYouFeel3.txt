 Be quick on your feet to respond, especially if you are nervous as your other friends will tell everyone if you admit your feelings.


Be ready to change the subject or divert the focus from you if the sensitive topic arises. When questioned about your feelings you have to have a determined-sounding response and fire back your response without too much (or too little) delay.
One of the biggest tell-tale signs of someone who is hiding their feelings is that they become uncharacteristically quiet or standoffish. If you want to hide your feelings, you have to hide the fact that you're hiding them as well! So be sure to try not to come across as overly quiet., If they ask you directly, and you still don't want to admit, you're going to have to consciousness look them in the eye and lie. Make your response simple and to the point.


Many people believe that making eye contact is a sign that the speaker is telling the truth so this along with your brief responses will help to keep your feelings secret.
 If you are overcome with anger or sadness and those feelings intensify in the presence of others, you may have to take some time out and avoid the people who stir those feelings in you.


In many cases, time will help alleviate some of your emotions, and you will be able to resume your relationship once things have cooled down.
In some cases, such as instances of extreme betrayal or abuse, it might be better to eliminate that relationship altogether.

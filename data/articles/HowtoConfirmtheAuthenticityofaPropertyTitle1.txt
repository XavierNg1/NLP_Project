 A property title is a comprehensive term referring to the legal rights an individual has to the property in question.Having title to a piece of property means you have ownership rights over that property and you can choose to do what you want with it.Therefore, a title is not a tangible item; it is only a legal term conveying your rights to something., While a title is not a tangible item, a deed is the legal written document that transfers title from one person to another.For example, assume Adam has title to Blueacre, a piece of land in California. If this is the case, Adam has certain legal rights to Blueacre because he holds title. If Adam wants to sell Blueacre to Brittany, Adam would give a deed to her (not a title). By giving a deed to Brittany, Adam has effectively transferred title from himself to Brittany.
This article will discuss what Brittany should do before the deed is given to her in order to ensure Adam can transfer title to her.
 Title questions will always come up in two common situations. If you are in one of these situations, you should read this article to determine how to analyze title.

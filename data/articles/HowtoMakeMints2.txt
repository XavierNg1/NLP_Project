 If you don't have any parchment paper, you can use wax paper or even plastic wrap. You will be setting the finished mint onto this to dry.

Plan ahead: avoid making these if it is humid. The moisture will make the mints stickier than usual., Cut the softened butter into smaller cubes and place it into a large bowl. Beat the butter using an electric mixer until it is soft any creamy. If you don't have an electric mixer, you can also use a food processor., Don't worry if the mixture doesn't form a dough-like texture yet. Hold off on adding the food coloring just yet; you will be kneading it into the mixture later., This will prevent the dough from sticking to it. Be sure to have the box or bag of confectioners' sugar on hand; you will likely need more of it., At this point, you can also add some food coloring. You can use either gel or liquid, but many people find that gel works better. Simply add 1 to 2 drops of food coloring and knead it into the dough until it is evenly mixed in., Lightly dust your work surface with more confectioners' sugar. Take about 2 tablespoons worth of the dough, and roll it into a ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick rope.

Keep the rest of the dough you aren't working with covered with a damp towel. This will prevent it from drying out too soon.
 Each piece should be between ½ and ¾-inch (1.27 and 1.91 centimeters) long., Use a spatula to transfer them. The mints will be very soft at this point, and if you use your fingers, you might squish them., Remember to keep the dough you aren't rolling and cutting under a damp towel, or it will harden and dry out too fast., This will prevent the mints from sticking to each other.Because these mints are made of butter, they will soften up again at room temperature. It is important to keep them cool.

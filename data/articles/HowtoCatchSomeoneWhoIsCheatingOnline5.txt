 Certain personality types are better off leaving this type of work to a professional. You might think about letting someone else check on your partner if you have some of the following qualities: you are emotionally insecure; you are a naturally jealous person; you are paranoid; you have an overactive imagination; or you tend to overreact in certain situations.
 Make sure you hire a licensed private investigator who practices within the bounds of the law. If you need to go to court with evidence gathered by this investigator, the evidence needs to be admissible in court. This may be particularly important if evidence is gathered from online surveillance; laws around electronic privacy can be convoluted, and a private investigator may have more experience with and understanding of these laws. A professional will also provide impartial observations, which can help you make an educated decision about your next steps.
 Private investigators are not cheap and charge hourly fees of $75 to $200. Be clear about how much time you’d like them to spend on your case. Also consider how you want to pay for this service. Do you need to keep it a secret? Keeping such a large fee secret you’re your partner may be difficult if you have a joint bank account.
 Gather some of the information about your partner's activities online, such as monitoring internet history or checking email first. Give the investigator basic facts and background information, which will enable them to spend less time figuring this out and more time getting to the root of the problem.

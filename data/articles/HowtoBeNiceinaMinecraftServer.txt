 If you find a new player in the server, help him or her with the spawn, minigames and more things that he or she does not know yet. You give help and in turn, this person will give you help too.
 Moreover, don't say such irritating things as: "You are just a noob! No way I am helping noobs!"; or "I don't even care! If you need help ask someone else!"; or, "Go watch a video of this server! I am not helping anyone." None of those things are nice and it's better to be cooperative, so that you get to share ideas and build amazing things together., Building giant and complex buildings and objects in Minecraft can be really hard. So, why don't you give your helping skills a try? Find someone that needs help building and help him or her to build it well. This will make you have new friends too; it will also help you to build better., If you grief, you will be reported and you won't be respected. Griefing and trolling might seem funny at the time but it's annoying, boring and rarely tolerated. Don't assume people will find it funny for long either; it's tedious. Griefing can also lose you friends, the people who would otherwise help you out., Do not burn or trash them. Some players may want them and they try to get them but they can't. Do not trade it, just give it if a player really needs it., Most kids play in Minecraft servers and their parents don't want them to swear. Use normal words to explain yourself; expletives aren't going to help get that structure built.

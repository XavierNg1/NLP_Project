 This will not only give your milkshake some extra flavor, but it will also replace the ice cream using in traditional milkshakes.
 Try to use the salted kind to help cut down on the sweetness of the milkshake. If you don't mind the extra sweetness, then you can use the regular, unsalted peanut butter. Also, try to use the smooth and creamy kind of peanut butter; it will be easier to blend and give you a smoother milkshake in the end.
 You can typically find it in the baking section of a grocery store. Because this is pure cacao/cocoa, it does not have any milk or dairy added to it. Avoid using any chocolate milk mix; that does have dairy in it.
 Don't add in the milk just yet; you will be doing that last. Keep blending the milkshake until the banana and ice have all broken up, and all of the ingredients are evenly mixed together. You may have to pause the blender, and use a rubber spatula to push any unmixed milkshake towards the bottom.
 The more milk you add, the thinner your milkshake will be. Plan on using 1 to 1 Â½ cups (240 to 360 milliliters) of milk. Unsweetened almond milk is recommended, but you can use any other type of non-dairy milk, such as cashew or soy. You can even use a flavored almond milk, such as vanilla.
 For a special touch, pop a thin banana slice onto the rim, and garnish the top with a sprinkle of cocoa powder.

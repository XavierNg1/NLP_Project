 You can use any type of wooden dowels, rolling pins, or spoon handles to drape the spun sugar. Since it's a matter of personal preference, you can try using one large rolling pin or several wooden handles. Cover your counter space and floor with foil. This will make clean up easier since the sugar may fall and harden.If you'd like to use several wooden handles or dowels, consider taping them to your counter space so they don't fall while you're spinning the sugar. Keep them several inches apart so you can pull the sugar between them.
 Dip the tines of one or two forks into your bowl of sugar syrup. Raise them up so the biggest drips of syrup fall back into the pan. Working quickly, point the fork tines down over the wooden dowels, handles, or rolling pin and wave your wrist back and forth.Moving your wrist quickly while the sugar falls will create thin delicate strands of sugar that you can form and work with.
 The strands of sugar will cool very quickly and you should be able to gently loosen them from the wood. Gather the strands of sugar together in your hands. Loosely cup your hands together so that the sugar strands form a small nest. Continue pulling and forming the strands to create as many nests as you need.Make sure your hands are cool when working with the spun sugar or else the thin strands may begin to melt.
 Since the nests are made of delicate sugar strands, they'll begin to absorb moisture from the air. You should serve the desserts with sugar nests immediately (or at least within an hour).If you must store them for a little while before serving, place the nests in an airtight container with parchment and silica packets (to absorb the moisture). This can help store them for up to one day.

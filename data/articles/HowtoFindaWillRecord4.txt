 You’ll need to search for a will by contacting the Superior Court of Justice where the personal representative filed the will. For this reason, you need to find the county or district where the deceased last lived.Ask around if you don’t know where the person lived. You can also search online or for death announcements in newspapers.
 The office you contact will depend on the province or territory that has the record. For example, in Alberta, you will need to contact the Surrogate office of the Judicial Centre where probate was opened.If you don’t know what office to contact, then call your local court and ask. They can direct you to the appropriate office.
 You might need to pay a search fee. In Alberta, for example, you must pay a $10.00 search fee per name. Viewing the file is included in the fee, but you’ll have to pay more if you want to photocopy the will.

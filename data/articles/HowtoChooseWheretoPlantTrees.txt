 In order for most trees to flourish, they will need plenty of sunlight, nutrient-rich soil, and opportunities to soak up rainwater. These 3 factors are absolutely essential when determining ideal locations to plant a tree.;
, Use a measuring tape to plot out its recommended radius where you want to plant your tree to ensure it will fit. Root systems on large trees are strong, and if you plant your trees too closely to buildings, sidewalks, concrete, or other structures, the roots may break them apart as they get larger.
 If your yard allows, plant 3 large trees, 1 each on the west, east, and north sides of your house. These locations can help to shade your house in the summer and block wind in the winter. These benefits can result in as much as a 50% reduction in energy costs.
 There may be cables, wires, and pipes buried in your yard, and you run the risk of serious injury or costly repairs if you cut into one of these while digging. Each utility should be willing to come out free of charge and mark off where its equipment is located.
 The shade will provide a much-needed escape from the sun.
 Consider centering them in a flower bed or displaying them along your walkway for added beauty.

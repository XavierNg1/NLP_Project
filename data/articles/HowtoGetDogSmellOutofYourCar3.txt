 If you don't want a dog odor to build up, give your dog something to lie down on in your car. Place an old blanket where your dog usually likes to sit in your car.If you're taking your dog somewhere like the beach, this can be very helpful. The smell of wet dog can be particularly strong.
Make sure to wash the blanket regularly.
 A bath can help your dog smell fresh. If you're taking it on a long road trip, give it a nice bath first. This will make your dog smell better when it gets in the car, preventing odor from developing.Do not bathe your dog too often, however. Most dogs do fine without regular baths. Only bathe your dog before a longer trip in the car.
 An unusually strong odor may indicate certain glands in your dog's body are clogged. If you notice your dog is suddenly developing a strong odor, take it to the vet. A vet can evaluate whether an odor is indicative of a health problem. If this is the case, your vet can think of solutions for the issue.

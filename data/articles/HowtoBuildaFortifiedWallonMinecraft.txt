 Cobblestone is a good option. Decide how many blocks deep and wide you would like it to be. If you decide it's too small, that doesn't matter because it's easy to expand it later.;
, These gaps (called crenels) allow your friends to shoot enemies with a bow without having to jump awkwardly whenever they fire. Add a wood plank walkway to the top of the walls below the crenels to create battlements.
 Stone bricks are a good idea to build out from the wall and create a pillar-like support that looks difficult to get through. An optional addition is to add stone brick slabs across the top of the wall to break up the large amounts of cobblestone.
 These will allow access from the top of the wall to the bottom. Also, add corners to each of the pillar sections on the wall and stairs above the stone brick running across the middle of the wall.
 Create this circle with the block you used for the wall base, (such as cobblestone) so that the tower blends in with the rest of the wall.
 Add crenels to the top, as you did before.
 Create two upper layers using stone brick blocks circling the entire tower (which helps break up the large amounts of cobblestone again). Also, add a wood plank walkway at the top of the tower to match the top of the walls.
 Create a staircase inside so that you and your allies can easily climb up and down the tower during battle. Also, use stone brick stairs to create two extra layers you added in the previous step appear smoother and extend out a little further. Finally, create a torch from netherrack for the top.

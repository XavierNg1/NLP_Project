 These are typically plastic bottles topped with a small sponge and are available at most office supply stores. To use this type of envelope moistener:


Hold the bottle vertically, sponge-end down, and run it along the strip of envelope glue while gently squeezing.
Be careful not to squeeze the bottle too much, or you may over-moisten the envelope and leave it sodden or puckered.
This method is more efficient when you need to seal a large number of envelopes at once (making it useful for sending out wedding invitations, holiday cards, etc.), but it can become messy if you squeeze the bottle too enthusiastically.
 These represent the latest in envelope-sealing technology and will both moisten and seal your envelopes for you. Electric moistener/sealer machines will automatically feed envelopes through, while manual machines must be hand-fed, potentially making them as labor intensive as other, lower-tech methods.


Because these are a relatively new technology, they’re not without their glitches, and some models may work better than others. Be sure to do your research before investing.
 If you prefer an old-school approach, you can find envelope moistening wheels online and in stores specializing in vintage office equipment. Most are ceramic and feature a cylindrical wheel perched in a rectangular basin, which makes them rather resemble an office tape dispenser. To use one, fill the basin with water, run the envelope’s glue strip across the top of the moistened wheel (like running a knife blade over a whetting stone), and fold and press the envelope flap to seal. Though a bit old-fashioned, these envelope moisteners have the advantage of durability—the ceramic wheel won’t disintegrate as sponges do.

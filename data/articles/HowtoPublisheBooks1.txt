 If you want to maximize your cut of sales, maintain absolute creative control, or participate in non-traditional copyright structures, self-publishing an eBook might be right for you.


This route is much more difficult than it sounds. It will require you to do all of your own marketing and editing, as well as deal with sellers. Though it will allow you more control, it is significantly more work.
Creative Commons licenses are useful for those planning on self-publishing. This will give you a template for the legalese to protect your work, as well as providing the freedom to decide how tightly you wish to control the work.;
, You may not want to deal with publishing your eBook on your own. You may not have time to devote to marketing, design, editing, or the formatting of an eBook. There is nothing wrong with this. If self-publishing sounds too complicated, you can find a traditional publisher to produce and sell your eBook.


Keep in mind that a traditional publisher will take a larger cut from your book sales and will often exert a certain level of control over the content and copyright.
Publishers will often be reluctant to take new authors. If you want to, get an agent who will help find a publisher for you and advocate for the quality of your work. An agent will also help you negotiate a good contract.

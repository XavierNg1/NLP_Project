This creates a new tack and clew, shortening the sail.



Begin with the luff (leading edge) cringle. Secure it to the boom by catching the grommet on a hook on the boom, if there is one, or by inserting a reefing hook into the grommet and tying it to the boom near the gooseneck. You can also tie the cringle to a cleat on the mast. This creates a new tack. Tighten the halyard to secure it.






Secure the leech (trailing edge) cringle to the aft part of the boom, creating a new clew. Do this by threading a line up from the boom, through the leech cringle, and back down to the boom. This line may be led either down or forward to a winch that can be used to tighten the connection.






Gather up the loose canvas. If there’s time, flake the foot of the sail so it’s easier to manage. Secure this excess canvas by tying it loosely above the boom with the attached reefing lines, or with bungee cords threaded through the cringles. Don’t tie these lines too tightly, or the sail will crease vertically, and don’t tie them under the boom. Use square or slip knots so these ties can be loosened quickly if necessary.






Check that the shortened sail is as flat as possible. Keep the lines securing the luff and leech cringles (tack and clew) tight, and the reefing holding the spare sail loose.

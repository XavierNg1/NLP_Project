 Boredom is an emotion, whilst you may feel bored, you are actually simply unoccupied! Boredom kills productivity, and decreases your value in the workplace. Find something to do and become more efficient.
 It is counterproductive and can get you into trouble. It is better to remind yourself that drama is illogical and should not be given an ounce of your valuable time.
 From primary school to graduate school, there will be excess emotions wherever you look. Avert your eyes and focus on your school work. If you work hard, there will be plenty of time for leisure. Getting caught up in drama and emotional displays will only distract you and lower your performance.

 You may choose how many times you prefer to rinse the tuna, but draining and rinsing it at least once is recommended.


Use a can opener to open the can, but donâ€™t remove the lid yet.
Holding the lid in place, flip the can over and hold it over the sink to drain the liquid.
Pull off the top of the can, being cautious not to cut yourself.
Take the tuna out of the can and place it in a strainer or colander.
Rinse the tuna thoroughly with water, then press the water out using a clean hand or a paper towel.
 In a medium bowl, mash the avocado together with the greek yogurt until smooth.


Stir in the tuna, onion, relish, celery, salt and pepper. lemon if using, and cayenne pepper if using.
Stir until all ingredients are well-combined.
 Distribute the tuna mix evenly across 4 slices of bread and top each with another slice of bread to make 4 sandwiches.


For a warm, crunchy variation, toast the bread before spreading the tuna mix on.
You can also substitute a roll or a croissant in place of the sandwich bread.
Or you can skip the bread and use the tuna mix over a salad for a lower-carb version.

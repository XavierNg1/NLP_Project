 Move in until you’re only a few inches away, with the wick at around mouth level. This way, the air won’t have to travel as far to reach the flame, which will allow you to put it out easier.Don’t hover directly over the candle, or the heat rising from the flame may burn you.;
, Exhale suddenly through the opening in your lips. The key is to create a thin stream of air that will put out the candle in one quick gust. Keep blowing until the flame is completely extinguished.If the flame sputters but doesn’t go out, you may not be blowing directly on it.
Be careful not to blow too forcefully—doing so can send droplets of wax spraying, resulting in a big mess or even minor burns.
 When you blow out a candle, it releases a plume of thick, dark smoke. Keeping your distance from the extinguished candle will prevent this smoke from depositing soot on your skin or clothes or causing them to smell.Whenever possible, make it a point to extinguish your candles in a well-ventilated area where smoke won’t collect.
Over the long term, blowing out your candles can lead to unsightly black buildup on the wax or around the the inside of the container.

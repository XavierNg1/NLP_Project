 This may not be very high on your list of priorities, but if you can find out why so many people like it, it may be easier for you.
 The FNAF series has a very complicated and sometimes incomprehensible backstory. Deciphering the mystery has become a mission of sorts to many people online, and it has yet to be debunked.


There are several FNAF YouTubers such as Smike and 8-Bit Gaming who produce FNAF videos on a regular basis that you can watch. Game Theory also has done a few videos on the series.
 The videos are produced specifically to poke fun at FNAF, and make them seem not so sinister.

 As you cut, try to visualize each piece coming together as the puppet; doing so will help to ensure you're cutting out the right size/shape for each piece.
 Leave approximately 1/8 inch/3.1mm seam. Use brown or neutral thread to sew the pieces together.



Insert the two shorter pipe cleaner pieces into the legs and the longer piece into the tail. This allows for bending the legs and tail when the chipmunk is whole.
 Be careful not to over-stuff the body and do not stuff the ears at all.
 Leave approximately 3/16 inch/4.7mm border for the opening.


Fold the body opening inside the top and sew closed.
 Fold the top over the left, right, bottom and back over the top (the same way you might fold a caramel candy wrapper). Use brown thread to close the gap and sew shut.
 Insert the ears into small openings at the top of the head. Sew into the head.
 Use a backstitch to sew the tail, using differently colored threads down the middle of the tail.

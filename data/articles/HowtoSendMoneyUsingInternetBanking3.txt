 If you need to send a large amount of money, your options may include a wire transfer, which is a method for sending funds electronically. You may be able to order a wire transfer through your Internet banking account.


Typically there are fees associated with wire transfers.Contact your bank/transfer service or check its website for details.
 Once you are logged in to your Internet banking account and have selected the wire transfer function, you will need to enter the account information of the person or entity you would like to send money to. Typically, this includes the recipient’s bank account number and bank routing number.


Depending on the bank or wire service you use, you may also be asked to enter additional information such as a SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) Code, which is used for identifying banks.Contact your institution’s customer service department if you have trouble locating such information.
 Remember that recently-deposited funds might take a while to become available in your account.
 Typically, you can choose to have a transfer go through immediately, or at a specified later date and time. In many cases, you can also arrange to have a certain transfer be recurring (such as to pay a monthly bill).


Many banks will set a transfer time of immediately or same day by default, so make sure to check and change this if necessary., Once you have selected the kind of transfer you want to make, and have entered all of the required information, you should review the details of your transaction. Make sure that everything (recipient information, amount of money, etc.) looks correct, and click to complete the transfer transaction. Ordinarily, your bank will give you a confirmation of the transfer, through the Internet banking interface, by email or by text message.

 To prevent buildups, remove any pop-up stoppers or drain guards on your sink and discard the debris that theyâ€™ve collected. Rinse before replacing.Most bathroom sinks feature an adjustable metal stopper than can be used to plug the sink. These can be removed by pulling them out of the drain.;
, Your bathroom sink collects bacteria that can contribute to unwanted scents and deposits within the drain. To kill this bacteria, use a biodegradable, non-corrosive pipe-cleaner once a month.Note that many well-advertised drain cleaners are full of chemicals that pose a risk to both your health and your pipes.
Follow the directions on any natural, store-bought cleaning products.
Bleach and anti-bacterial products are not recommended. They are unnecessary and can potentially damage plumbing systems. This is especially important if you have a septic tank.
 Instead of a packaged drain cleaner, use salt, baking soda, vinegar, and/or lemon juice to deodorize and clean your sink. Mix whichever of these you have on hand into about a cup of solution and pour it into the drain. Let it sit for an hour before rinsing with hot water.

 Do not let a person die alone. Let them experience love and friendship as they pass. If the person is unresponsive, hold their hand and talk to them.;
, Contract a hospice nurse to provide pain management. Provide a special mattress to alleviate pressure. Offer water, but do not force hydration. If the person is incontinent, keep them clean and dry.
 The transition out of this life can be a source of anxiety or fear. Offer conversation of faith and peace. Offer to read Scripture and pray.
 It may seem humiliating to a person when they are incontinent or totally dependent on others for activities of daily living. Tell the person how you admire and respect them.
 Talk about times and occasions in life that were important to the dying person. Talk about humorous incidents. Talk about activities and hobbies that have been rewarding. Talk to family members about what they would consider the significant events of their loved one's life.
 Don't do all the talking. Don't be afraid to sit in silence.
 Bring in meals. Offer time for respite. Promise to be available during bereavement.
 Back off of any intervention that makes the dying person uncomfortable. Be thoughtful and considerate.

 A starter Pokémon is the very base of an effective team. There are three for HeartGold and SoulSilver:


Choose Chikorita, the Grass-type, if you want your starter to deal primarily with the Defense stats and status conditions. This Pokémon is excellent for setting up Reflects and Light Screens, and also learns a few powerful moves at later levels.
Choose Cyndaquil, the Fire-type, if you want a starter with powerful Special Attack. This Pokémon's offensive movepool, coupled with its stats, can often make it effective enough to be the lead.
Choose Totodile, the Water-type, if you want the starter to have an excellent Attack stat. While the number of Special Attack moves in its movepool can be a bit of a hindrance, this Pokémon is often seen as the most powerful of the three starters stat-wise.;
, It's good that you cover your starter with the type that can beat the type that your starter is weak to.


To protect Chikorita, a variety of different Pokémon can be used on account of its many type weaknesses. It is recommended to use Fire-types like Growlithe or Vulpix to protect it from Bug and Ice, or Ground-types like Sandshrew to combat Fire and Poison.
To protect Cyndaquil, employ a Water-type like Wooper or Psyduck in order to defend it from Rock- and Ground-type attacks. An Electric- or Grass-type may also be effective for its Water-type weakness, so Mareep and Bellsprout are viable options.
To protect Totodile, use Ground-type Pokémon to defend it from Electric attacks, or Fire-type Pokémon to defend it from Grass attacks.
 A Psychic-, Dark-, Fighting-, and Ice-type lineup, for example, can be used to beat the Elite Four and the Champion easily.
 Make sure you have some dual types!

 The process may be easier if you are a parent that agrees to the termination. You'll still need approval from a court. Most courts are unlikely to accept the termination unless someone else is ready to adopt the child (and not just the other parent).Teenage mothers overwhelmed by the responsibility may also be able to use this route.A parent who cannot support the child may be able to give the baby to a safe haven instead.A parent cannot terminate parental rights to avoid paying child support., If you have a valid reason for terminating the rights, and think the child would be better off for it, contact your local courthouse. The first step will be obtaining and signing a consent form.


Your courthouse may call the form Voluntary Termination of Parental Rights, Voluntary Relinquishment of Parental Rights, Consent to Termination of Parental Rights, Affidavit of Waiver of Parental Rights, or any similar title.
 The court employee should let you know when you are due in court. The court may also ask the child and/or the child's guardian to appear. After questioning you about the situation, the judge will make a decision.


Even if you have legal grounds to request termination, the judge may not allow it. The judge typically rules based on what its best for the child.
If your rights are terminated, the judge should let you know how this affects your child support payments or other fees.

 To do this, remove the tofu from its packaging and place on a clean plate. Drain off any water. Put another plate top-side down on the tofu and add a weight on top of that—a big can of beans or something similar is the ideal weight. Leave the tofu like this for 15 minutes. Drain off the water that accumulates from this "pressing.";
,, Add the chopped vegetables and sauté for 5 minutes. Stir with the wooden spoon or spatula frequently as they cook.
 Continue to stir the mixture—from the edges to the center, turning the mixture over towards the middle—as the tofu will stick to the bottom of the pan if you don't.
 Combine well, stirring for another 1–2 minutes.
 Nice additions to your healthful breakfast include a baked tomato, fried potatoes or potato hash, whole-grain toast, steamed asparagus or other vegetables, brown rice, etc.

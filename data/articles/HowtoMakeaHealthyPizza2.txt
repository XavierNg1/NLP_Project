 If you'd rather not use a flour-based crust, there are other alternatives that you can try that are healthy options.


Turn a whole-wheat tortilla into your crust if you want a thinner crust. Simply bake the tortilla on a pizza stone with toppings.
Try a whole-wheat pita pocket that you bake. Bagels with the filling removed can also work. Simply scoop out the doughy insides of the bagel with a spoon or knife, leaving only the shell. Place your pizza ingredients inside of it as you would a pita pocket. Use quinoa. You could make your crust with a healthier grain like quinoa. Stay away from processed flour. Quinoa is a gluten-free whole grain. , Vegetables give you a nutritional boost. The crust is no exception. It can be made entirely out of vegetables, reducing calories and boosting nutritional potential.


Make cauliflower dough. Place cauliflower florets into a word processor and pulse, until you turn the vegetables into the consistency of warm sand. Microwave for several minutes. Drain. Place the pulsed vegetable on a kitchen towel, and remove all liquid. Add 1 teaspoon almond flour to bind the cauliflower, along with 1/3 cup of grated Parmesan and grated Mozzarella cheese each, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon basil, 1/2 teaspoon oregano,1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1 egg, and 1/2 teaspoon grated the garlic. Mold the mixture into balls and press on parchment paper into circle shapes. Bake for 10 minutes at 450 degrees Fahrenheit. To make zucchini dough, follow a similar process. Grate and drain it. Then add same binding agents like mozzarella, almond meal, egg, Parmesan cheese, oregano, garlic powder, and salt. Forget dough completely and put your pizza toppings on the top of a portabella mushroom (or eggplant).

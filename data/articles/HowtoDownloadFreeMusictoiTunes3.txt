 After you've downloaded your free music, the next step is opening it up in iTunes and listening. iTunes is fairly easy program to negotiate, making this a relatively easy step in most cases. If you've just downloaded a file or two, you can open iTunes first, and drag the files directly into the open window of your Library. The file should open in a few seconds.


If the file doesn't open, right-click on the file icon and go to "Get Info" to find out what kind of file it is. If it's other than an MP3, you might need to reformat to open it in iTunes.
 If your files ended up in your Download folder, you can also open the files by double or right-clicking on the files and selecting iTunes as your default program to open them. On most computers, iTunes should already be selected as the default.
 Many larger files such as mixtapes may be packaged in the form of zip files that you must unzip. Many newer operating systems come pre-equipped to zip and unzip files, but older OSâ€™s may require third-party software such as WinZip in order to do so.


Reformat other file formats to MP3. Occasionally, you might end up with MP4 files, AAC, .wav, or other varieties of sound files that you may not be able to open instantly with iTunes. Each file may need to be reformatted before you'll be able to play it in iTunes, which only plays a limit variety of sound files.

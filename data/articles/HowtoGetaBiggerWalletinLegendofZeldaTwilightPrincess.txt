 The cute little bug girl is the one with all the dough!;
, There's a reason why she's always talking about them....You'll probably notice that with each bug you bring, you get 50 rupees for one and then 100 rupees for it's match.
 There are 24 bugs in the game, 2 of each. Once you find the twelfth she will give you 500 rupees and a wallet holing 500 rupees.
 You only get the Giant Wallet holding 1000 rupees when you give Agatha all the bugs, male and female.

 Use the outline you drew earlier if you want a guide. Paint two ovals close to each other. This will act as the foundation for the rest of the painting., The sclera is the white part of your eyes.The sclera in the eyes is never a pure white. Mix white paint with a touch of another color like light grey, light blue or light pink. Paint two ovals in the paint you just created. The scleras should be the same shape as the outline of the eyes, but smaller and inside the flesh toned outline.
 Add depth by shading and adding different tints. To make simple eyelashes you can draw with dark brown around the oval, but make sure to blend it well with the skin color. If you want to make more realistic eyelashes, you need a small brush and add the lashes one by one.

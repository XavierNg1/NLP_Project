 Make reading and history your favorite subjects, classic novels, and pretty much anything traditional that you can get your hands on!

, Never swear or say racist comments. This makes you ugly on inside and out, so rude.
 Do some research on how old-fashioned bedrooms/homes where decorated. World Market has amazing old-world pieces, try other stores also.
 It may be hard to cut out, but swearing is one of the worst things you could do, if you're trying to be ladylike. Try making a deal with your friends about not swearing for a day. Just think about proving to everyone you have the willpower and self-control to actually control and think about what comes out of your mouth. Definitely avoid calling names such as: "moron" or "idiot." Try to make very calm, civil opinions and comebacks, not the regular irritating stuff. It'll take practice, but it's a huge step towards being innocent and old-fashioned.
 Having a selfish and nasty attitude toward others will drag you very far away from being lady-like. Have a real smile on your face. Be willing to let people borrow things from you. Don't forget to take a classic shower with a scented soap! Soaps with sandal-wood is a great choice.
 This is a difficult step, but also a crucial one. Being graceful doesn't mean you have to hate sports and walk on tiptoe, just make sure you walk with your head up, shoulders rolled back, maintaining good posture. Don't swagger or swing your hips. It looks exaggerated and weird. Don't swing your arms either: Keep them by your side.
 Go to bed on time, offer to wash the dishes, bring in the groceries, teach your little brother how to tie his shoes, or whatever you can think of that could benefit your family in some way. No matter how tempting it is, if you know there's something you should be doing, (no matter how badly you don't want to do it), do it!

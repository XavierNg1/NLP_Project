 Thomas Connley, DDS, recommends a good rule of thumb is to not share drinks with someone you wouldn’t kiss on the lips.This will limit the person you are sharing drinks, and germs, with.


There are many diseases, like mono or even meningitis you can contract by sharing drinks.At the same time, consider whether or not you really know this person's health history. A lot of people can be ill and not even know it. For instance, the person may have never had a cold sore, but may in fact be a carrier of the virus (it is estimated that 90% of adults carry the virus)., A simple way to share a drink with your friends is pouring the liquid in clean, separate glasses. This shares the drink without worry of cross contamination. Enjoy a drink with your friend, but do not enjoy each other’s germs!


If you are worried about splitting the drink in equal parts, first pour the drink in a measuring cup to measure exactly how much liquid each glass is receiving.
 You can pour a single drink in a glass before sharing it with a friend. There are a few ways to share a drink with a friend from a single glass.


Use straws. This may allow you to isolate your germs to just your straw where your mouth meets the straw. However, there may still be germs from your saliva in the drink.

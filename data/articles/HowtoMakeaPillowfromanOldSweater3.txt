 You can use cotton or linen fabric, but the color needs to be solid, and it needs to match your sweater.The extra inch will give you ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowances.

Make sure that the fabric is big enough to wrap around your pillow form.
Choose a pillow form that is a few inches/centimeters smaller than your sweater. This will ensure that you have enough material to cover it.
 You can use any type of sweater you want, but one with a cable or rib pattern would look more interesting. Cut the sweater straight along the top, just below the armpits, and up the side seams. Separate the front and back panel.

If your sweater has a ribbed hem, cut it off.
 Do not cut the sweater panels down to fit the fabric squares just yet. You will do that towards the end.This is because the sweater fabric may stretch past the fabric squares.

Do not pin the front and back sweater panels together just yet.
 Once again, do not sew the front and back sweater panels together just yet. Simply sew the fabric squares to the back of each panel, ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) away from the edge of the fabric square., If you want to, you can serge the edges, or stitch around them using a zigzag stitch on your sewing machine. This will keep the edges from unraveling., Pin the two panels together, with the sweater sides facing inward and the fabric sides facing outward. Use your sewing machine to sew along all four edges using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Leave a gap along one of the edges so that you can insert your pillow., If your sweater is very bulky, you may need to clip the corners first. This will help reduce the bulk., Fold the raw edges in, then stitch the seams together using a ladder stitch. Your pillow is now complete!

 If you are just practicing, cast on 10 stitches.






;
, Continue alternating between knitting and purling stitches until you reach the end of the row. Remember to place your yarn either in front or behind the stitch you are making so that the yarn is in the correct position to either knit or purl.








Knitting patterns may describe the first row of the seed stitch as K1, P1, K1, (*repeat to end of row). The “K” stands for knit and the “P” stands for purl., Before you begin your next row, check the first stitch. If your last stitch was a knit stitch on the last row, then purl that stitch on the new row. If your last stitch on the previous row was a purl stitch, then knit that stitch on the new row. Then continue alternating stitch types as before.As you continue, just remember to:








Purl your knit stitches. Knit stitches look flatter and have a criss-cross pattern.
Knit your purl stitches. Purl stitches stick out more and they do not have a criss-cross pattern., Keep checking the stitch type when you start a new row and alternating as you continue the rows until you are finished with your project.

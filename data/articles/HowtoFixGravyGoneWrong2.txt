 If you improperly add your thickening agent, you may get lumpy gravy. One way of working out lumps is to give the gravy a good whisking. This will help break down the congealed clumps of cornstarch or flour. Especially when you are making a roux, be sure to use a whisk to prevent initial lumpiness.Avoid using a using spoon to mix your roux. Always whisk it to prevent lumps.
 If your gravy is particularly lumpy, you may just have to strain it. Take a mesh strainer and pour your gravy through it and into the serving dish. This should remove most of the clumps from your gravy.


If you still have lumps, strain the gravy until they are gone.
 If your gravy is extra lumpy or thick, you can add stock or water to the mixture. Heat up the stock or water and then pour it into your hot gravy, whisking the mixture as you do it. Continue adding liquid until the gravy is the consistency that you want.This is also a great tip for heating up gravy that has congealed in the refrigerator.

 Breast weight is not typically taken in the doctor's office, but if you have concerns, discuss the matter with your doctor and see if he or she can help you come up with a more accurate number. Your doctor will be able to address your needs and answer any questions you have about the health and size of your breasts.
 Breasts, like other body parts, are a little different on every person. Rather than comparing the weight or size of your breasts to that of others, the best way to stay healthy is to attend to the needs of your individual body by doing the following:


Get regular pap smears and mammograms according to the recommendations for your age group.Conduct regular self-examinations so you'll notice if something changes.Wear a bra that fits instead of one that's too constricting or not supportive enough.

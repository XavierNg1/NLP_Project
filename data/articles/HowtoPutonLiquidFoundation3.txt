 While many kinds of brushes can be used to apply foundation, the best choice is a dense, flat-top brush specially designed for applying foundation., Cleanse and moisturize your face using your regular products. Allow a few minutes for your moisturizer to fully absorb, and carefully blot any excess moisturizer with a tissue.









For a perfect finish, you may also apply a makeup primer at this time.
 You can either use the back of your hand, a small dish, or a folded up napkin. Spread the foundation out with your finger so that you have a thick even layer to dip your brush in.
 You only want to use the ends of the bristles. Don't dunk the brush or grind it into the foundation.
 Begin using a stippling, circular motion, starting at the nose, then move to the cheeks, chin, and forehead working in small circles. Work out from these central areas to the edges of your face, using short, quick strokes in the same direction.









Remember to use a light touch, you want to sweep the foundation into your skin with the brush, not paint it on.
 Continue to use a stippling motion to blend along the hairline, jawline and ears.
 Wait 2-3 minutes for your foundation to dry. Blot with a tissue, if needed, and apply other makeup. Then apply a translucent finishing powder gently with a puff, or fluffy brush, and get ready for the compliments to come pouring in!








, Blot your brush on a tissue to remove any remaining foundation. Clean your brush once a week using a mild shampoo or specialized brush cleaner.

 Select an established and professional piercer to get the job done properly. Go somewhere with high standards hygiene, a good reputation and any required licenses. Here are some places you can get your piercing:


Claire's
Piercing Pagoda
Tattoo Parlors (some)
Beauty shops (some);
, You are likely not to enjoy getting your ears puckered as much if you make it a spur of the moment thing.
 Guns, some believe, are likely to tear the ear. It is recommended to use a needle and get a professional from a tattoo and piercing parlor, especially if you are getting a piercing on other parts of your ear besides your lobe.
 Listen closely to everything the piercer says, especially the terms and conditions.
 If you feel afraid, take out your stress ball, if you have one. Try your hardest to relax!

, There are usually a lot to choose from. Try to choose some that go with all outfits because you will have to wear them for about six weeks. (depending whether it was a gun or a needle)

, It helps you relax and relief the tension.
 It should barely hurt.
 You survived this and deserve it.
 Now for the fun part!-- You can finally go earring shopping!

, Once that day rolls around, you can take the earrings out. Remember, though, to replace them with different earrings so the piercings do not heal over. Also, make sure you only wear posts for the first six months.

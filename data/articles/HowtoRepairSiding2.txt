 Small cracks can be repaired with a good epoxy and some touch up paint. Large cracks and rips are best resolved by putting in a new piece of siding.


Don't be alarmed if your vinyl siding moves back and forth as you inspect it. It expands and contracts due to weather conditions and is installed in a manner to allow for this.

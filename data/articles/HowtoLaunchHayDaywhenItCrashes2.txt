 Sometimes a fresh install will address any issues, including crashing.


To uninstall the game on iOS, tap and hold the Hay Day app icon until it shakes, and then tap the “X” button that appear on it.
On Android, open the Application Manager from the Settings. Find Hay Day from the list of Downloaded apps, and tap on it to open the app’s information page. From the page, tap the “Uninstall” button.
 Launch your device’s app store, and search for Hay Day. Once you find it, tap the “Install” button.
 Once the installation is done, look for the Hay Day app on your device and tap on it. It may take a few seconds since the app will check for updates first to ensure it’s up-to-date.
 Since you’ve done a fresh install, you will be given a starting farm. In order to get your old farm and game data back, you can connect the game to your Facebook account again. Tap the gear button on the game screen, and tap the Facebook button. The app will request access to connect to your Facebook account. Grant it.
 You can now play Hay Day again and resume with your old farm, hopefully with no more crashes. .

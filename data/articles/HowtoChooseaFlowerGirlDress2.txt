 Find a length that is suitable to her age. Choose a shorter dress for a very young flower girl, so she wonâ€™t trip on the hem. Pick a longer dress for an older girl, if this is in keeping with the theme of your wedding., Get a dress your flower girl can grow into in case you need to buy it far in advance. Select a loose-fitting, longer dress so that she has space to grow. Alternatively, buy the dress as close to the wedding date as possible., While flower girls do not need fittings like brides and bridesmaids, make sure the dress fits. Go with her when she buys it and ask to see it on her. Closer to the wedding, make it fun for her to try on her dress so you can check the fit. For example, bring her to a fitting and have her try on her dress for the wedding party when you and your bridesmaid try on yours.

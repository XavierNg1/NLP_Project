 Lilacs usually only need watering in the heat of the summer or in dry climates. If you receive less than one inch of water per week in the summer, water them lightly at that point., They donâ€™t do well in standing water. Add more soil so that water drains away if you find water pooling near the canes., Make a mixture of a half a cup (118ml) of milk and a gallon (3.8l) of water. Spray your leaves thoroughly.

The lactobacillus will colonize the leaves and prevent outbreak of powdery mildew.

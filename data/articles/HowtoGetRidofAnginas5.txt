 Chest pain or discomfort occurs between 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Chest pain is the most common symptom people with angina experience.


The pain is located over the center of the breastbone. Patients will often press a clenched fist against the area of pain which is known as the Levineâ€™s sign.
The pain occurs after mild physical exertion. It may occur at rest in some cases. Resting usually relieves the angina after a few minutes.
Chest discomfort can be described as a heavy chest. It is often likened to an elephant sitting on the chest.
 This is the second most common symptom of angina. The pain is described as a tingling sensation that starts from the left shoulder and travels down to the left arm.


The pain is produced because the nerve of the heart also supplies the skin of the left shoulder and arm.
Sometimes, the pain may be felt simultaneously in the left and right shoulder.
 The pain is often felt in the left jaw. The nerve that supplies the heart and skin of the jaw are the same; hence, pain is felt in the jaw when angina sets in.
 This tummy ache often occurs in the upper abdomen, and generally manifests in the elderly.


The pain is reproduced because the nerve supplying the heart and upper abdomen skin are the same.
Elderly individuals who complain of tummy ache should be brought to a physician in order to rule out angina.
 Fatigue is caused by a deficit in oxygen supply to the different parts of your body. The heart itself cannot receive sufficient oxygen, so it cannot pump oxygen elsewhere.
 Passing out occurs because of a lack of oxygen flow to the brain. The brain is very metabolically active and needs blood and oxygen flow to function optimally. Insufficient oxygen leads to a power shortage and the eventual shutting down of brain function.

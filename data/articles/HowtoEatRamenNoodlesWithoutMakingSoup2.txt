 Fill a medium sized pot halfway with water. Boil the water over high heat. Insert the frozen veggies into the pot. Keep the heat set to high so the water reaches a boil again. Add ramen to the boiling water. Cook the veggies and noodles about 3 minutes.


Your veggies and noodles may cook in under 3 minutes. When the veggies and noodles are both tender, remove the pot from the heat., Place a strainer in your sink. Take the pot from the burner and pour the veggies and noodles into the strainer to drain the water from them. Keep the veggies and noodles in the strainer and set it off to the side. Return the pot to the stovetop.
 Set the potâ€™s burner to medium heat. Combine water, the ramen seasoning packets, and the French onion cheese with a whisk in the pot. Stir the mixture continuously until it is smooth., Shake the veggies and noodles while they are still in the strainer slightly back and forth over the sink to remove any remaining water from them. Then pour the veggies and noodles back into the pot. Stir the ingredients until they are well distributed and the veggies and noodles are coated with the sauce., Use a wooden spoon to stir in the pimientos. Cook all ingredients for about 3 minutes. When the ingredients are hot and evenly covered in the sauce, the veggie ramen primavera is completed. Serve and enjoy.

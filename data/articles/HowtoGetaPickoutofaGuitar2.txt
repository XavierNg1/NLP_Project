 This technique involves some up-and-down movement, so it's easiest done standing. You should have some space to move around, so be aware of your surroundings. Make sure you - and the guitar's neck - are far enough away from your 60 inch flat screen TV or mom's favorite lamp.
 The sound hole should be facing the floor. Keep a firm grip with one hand at the heel where the fretboard meets the body, and the other on the lower bout. If you're lucky, the pick might just fall out, but you'll more than likely have to do some maneuvering.
 Listen for the sound the pick makes from inside the body to track where it is. If the pick doesn't fall out of the sound hole, try to shake it to the top and center of the guitar, toward the neck. The goal is to strategically corral the pick.
 Do this in a quick motion once youâ€™ve moved the pick to the top and center of the body. Let gravity slide the pick down the body until it falls out of the sound hole.

 When you first use your griddle, you can add a protective coating – or “seasoning” – to it to prevent rust and make it easier to clean in the future. To season your griddle, pour one teaspoon (five milliliters) of vegetable oil onto the griddle. Use a paper towel to spread the oil across its entire surface. Let the oil sit on the griddle for one hour. Wipe up any residual oil after an hour has passed. Season your griddle again if you’re using it again for the first time after a long period of disuse., Non-stick cooking sprays have a high water content and burn easily. And if you’re cooking on a griddle with a nonstick coating, they’re completely redundant. Corn oil, likewise, should be avoided. The high sugar content in corn oil tends to caramelize (melt) and coat the surface in a sticky, burnt mess., Use a paper towel to wipe the surface down. The small amount of oil that remains on the griddle after a light wipe-down will help season the griddle., Pour room-temperature club soda directly on the griddle. Pull oil and food scraps toward the grease trough with a metal spatula. Wipe the surface down with a paper towel, then season your griddle., When using your griddle, avoid using metal forks or spatulas. These could lead to scratching or removal of your griddle’s nonstick coating, if present. Instead, utilize rubber, plastic, or wooden cooking implements.One exception to this rule is in the case of ceramic or stainless steel griddles, which can withstand a metal griddle scraper or other implement.

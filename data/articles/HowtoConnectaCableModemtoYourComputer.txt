 Take the modem out of the box and determine if what you have is indeed a cable modem. It should have a coaxial port, or a small cylindrical protrusion located on its back. A DSL modem won’t have that; instead, DSL modems have telephone cable ports like those you find on telephones into which you can plug in the telephone line coming from the wall. Accessories should include the following:


An Internet cable for connecting the modem to your computer
The cable modem’s power adapter
A coaxial cable for connecting the modem to the cable line;
, Before you plug a modem, make sure to read first the voltage rating written on the power adapter to make sure that it matches the voltage rating of the outlet you are going to plug it into. Doing so will help avoid any short circuit.
 Once you’ve taken the cable modem out of the box, take the power adapter and plug it to the power port on the modem (located along the area of the coaxial cable). Take the other end of the power adapter, and plug it to a power outlet.
 Take the coaxial cable coming from your wall and connect it to the port at the back of the modem. Tighten it securely by screwing the cable into the port.
 There’s only one port on the modem where the Internet cable can fit into, so it’s pretty easy find. Take the other end of the Internet cable, and plug it to the back of your computer (the same port with the modem).
 Press the Power button on your modem to switch it on. As it boots up, the lights on the cable modem will blink, telling you that it’s trying to connect to the ISP’s server. Once the cable modem establishes a connection, the lights will become steady.


You can now start surfing the Internet using your cable modem.

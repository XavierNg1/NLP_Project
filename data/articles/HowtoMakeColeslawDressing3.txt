 If you like the peanut taste but are not a big fan of spicy slaws, you can tone down the amount of hot sauce the recipe calls for, or skip it completely without dramatically altering the consistency of the dressing.
 Whisk together the honey, vegetable oil, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, peanut butter, salt, hot sauce, ginger, and garlic in a large bowl.


The sticky, thick honey and peanut butter will be the last things to dissolve. In particular, once the peanut butter is dissolved, you can take that as an indication that the dressing is ready.
Since some of the ingredients are fairly thick and sticky, you may have difficulty using a whisk to combine them. If this happens, you can switch the whisk out for a mixing spoon.
 Taste test the dressing using a clean spoon and make minor adjustments to the seasonings to meet with your preferences.


As a general rule, avoid changing the amount of "staple" ingredients used, such as honey, oil, vinegar, or peanut butter. The "seasoning" ingredients can be altered more easily, though.
 Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until you are ready to serve the coleslaw.


Fold your coleslaw mix into the dressing, thoroughly coating all the vegetables with dressing.

 It is important for it to have a zipper (like a storage bag) or for you to be able to close it to make a seal, so it should not have any holes/leaks.;
,, Keep your plant inside of its pot (but remove any other plastic wraps or containers surrounding the pot) and place the whole container inside of the bag.
 The reason why it's wilted is because the roots are dehydrated. This lets the roots rehydrate quickly.
 Once you are sure your plant is hydrated, carefully remove your plant so you do not wash away your soil, and then pour the water out of the bag.
 By sealing the bag, you are creating a humid environment, letting your plant hydrate the rest of the way without drowning the roots.
 You still want it to receive light but you don't want to cook the plant in the bag. It should take as little as a few hours up to several days for your plant to revive.
 Some herbs need lots of light, some are more shade tolerant. Be sure to place your herb in the appropriate light and water from the bottom so the roots can stay hydrated.

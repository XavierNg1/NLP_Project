 If a fox is raising a family in your yard, consider allowing it to stay until the kits are old enough to travel. They should be able to leave safely at nine weeks old, when they start hunting with their parents. This usually happens in late spring or early summer.The first time you see kits out of the den, they're probably around four or five weeks old. Give them another month before you drive them out.
 Most dens are in enclosed spaces, such as crawlspaces or rock shelters. Soak rags or straw in commercial fox repellent, and place them in the path of the entrance. Pile it high without blocking the fox's access., If there are foxes living in the den, they should move the repellent out of the way frequently. Check daily and replace with fresh repellent if necessary.
 If a batch of repellent is still blocking the entrances after two days, the foxes have probably moved on. Block the entrance with a more substantial barrier, such as bricks or cinder blocks.

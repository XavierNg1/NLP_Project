 This is the easiest and most often used as a way to make vaccinations easier for your baby. A distraction can even make the pain non-existent for some babies, because before the baby even realizes what is going on, the shot will have already been administered. You can give your baby a new toy to play with or sing a song to him/her. You can also try telling your baby a funny story or reading him/her a book.


Another good distraction for your baby may be cartoons. If your doctor has a TV in the examination room, tune it in to some cartoons. Your baby may become engulfed in the show and may forget why he/she is even there. If your doctor doesn’t have a TV in the examination room, ask your doctor if it is okay for you to bring your own. You can bring in a portable DVD player with your baby’s favorite show or movie.
 Studies have shown that if you give your baby something sweet to eat right before the vaccination, it will help to ease the pain. This trick can be used on small babies as well, by simply dipping their pacifier in some sugary water. Older babies and toddlers can suck on a lollipop.
 Try using a skin numbing cream to help reduce the amount of pain your baby will experience. There are a few good creams out there that will help numb the skin and keep the nerves from releasing pain signals to your baby’s brain. Make sure that you apply the cream approximately one hour before the procedure to make sure it has time to work. Check with your doctor about which cream is recommended for your baby.
 Your baby will feed off of your energy and if you are overly stressed then your baby will be stressed also.


It is not necessary to try to explain to your baby that the shot is necessary, because your baby will not understand any of what you are saying in that moment.
If your baby starts protesting the shot, it is important that you stand firm and remain calm. Never become angry with your baby and always speak in a calm, soothing tone.

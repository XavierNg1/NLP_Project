, Basically what happens here is anyone in the game can nominate someone else in the game to be killed out of the game.


Once someone has been nominated, someone else has to agree and second him. Once the person has been seconded that person is now "on trial".

The first person to nominate the person "on trial" has to give their reason for nominating him or her. Then the person who seconded the person "on trial" has to give their reason.
The person that is on trial has the opportunity to give their defense. The defense can be as long as the person wants it to be, and another person may come to another personâ€™s defense.
Next it is time to vote to see if the person is killed or not. If the majority wants the person to live, than that person will stay alive, and if the majority wants that person to be voted off, then they are dead for the round.

After a person dies, the moderator can tell everyone what the person was in the game.




This process will continue until someone is voted off.
If a person is voted for and survives, that person is immune to being killed until the next open kill. Someone in each round must be voted off. If everyone is voted for and no one dies, then the night comes and no one died during the day.

 Recognize your skills and abilities but also your limitations. If you already have some carpentry skills then maybe it isn’t so crazy to try to build your own coffee table. However, if you’ve never used a power tool before you might want to start with something more simple. Don’t put yourself in danger. If you're going to be doing your DIY project with kids, make sure to take their skills and ages into account, too. Younger kids will need more supervision and shouldn't handle things that might be dangerous, such as sharp scissors or hot glue.
 If you just want to spend an afternoon doing something productive then you probably shouldn’t try to paint your entire house. Maybe you can repaint one wall in your living room, but the whole house is probably a little aggressive. Choose a project that fits with your timeframe so that you don’t end up with a half finished project that never gets done. A lot of projects will have a designated time frame, but a lot of this depends on your skill level. Be prepared to be flexible.
If you're planning to DIY a gift, make sure you give yourself enough time to fix any mistakes you might make. Projects rarely turn out perfect on the first try.
 There are always going to be a ton of projects that seem fun to do, but a great way to narrow down your options is to figure out what chores are absolutely necessary. Once you’ve figured that out, you can decide if you’re capable of doing the task on your own. Changing your oil is a great example. Everyone needs to change his or her oil on their vehicle, but maybe you can learn how to do it yourself and skip the cost!
DIY holiday or Christmas decorations are a fun thing to try because there's no pressure. A few mistakes just add to the "homemade" look!

 A box grater is four sided, with each side having differently sized teeth.


Because box grates tend to have larger teeth, they work well with softer cheeses such as mozzarella or havarti.
Choose whichever grater plate suits the dish. The medium sized holes are great for garnishing tacos, but not so much for making crumb-like Parmesan to go on Spaghetti.
 This will prevent you from scraping your fingers before you have the desired amount of shredded cheese.
 This will make the cheese glide easier.
 For box graters without a handle, hold the cheese and grater over a large bowl. For graters with a handle, place the end of the grater on a cutting board.
 Once you reach the end of the cheese, rub it with your palm to avoid scraping your knuckles.

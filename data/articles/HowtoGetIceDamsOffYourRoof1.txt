 Ice dams are caused by fluctuations in temperature on various parts of the roof. Such fluctuations occur when electrical wiring, exhaust vents, or uneven insulation cause parts of your roof to heat up, but leave the eaves and gutters cold. So be on the lookout for any heat sources in your attic that might be causing ice dams., You can keep your entire roof at an equal temperature by installing a ridge vent and soffit vents around your roof. These vents help to circulate cold air under the entire roof, eliminating the "hot spots" and "cold spots" that cause ice dams.Make sure you use soffit and ridge vents that have the same size of opening. It is generally accepted that you will need 1 sq. ft. of opening for every 300 sq. ft. of attic space.Make sure you use baffles at all the eaves of your roof to ensure proper airflow from the soffit vents.For instructions on how to install these vents, click here.

Try spreading fiber-reinforced mastic on all the joints of your HVAC and exhaust ducts.You will want to cover the joints thoroughly with R-5 or R-6 foil-faced fiberglass., Old-style lighting fixtures in your attic could be generating ambient heat, increasing the temperature huge temperature differences in different areas of your attic. To fix this problem, you should replace all the old lighting fixtures with “IC” fixtures that can be covered in insulation.

 You might think something is unfair, but don't push them to think you're not mature.;
, If it is something you don't want to do, just simply tell your parents it is not something you feel like doing. If they still insist you to handle it, don't yell, just go do it. Even if you don't want to, you have to respect your parents.
 If they need help doing to dishes or doing laundry, give them a helping hand. They will always Try to give back in return.
 If your working on getting something, don't do anything that might make them not want to give it to you. You don't want to ruin everything you worked so hard for.

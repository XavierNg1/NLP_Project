 Don't be loud or annoying, you want a good impression on the guy/girl. Don't look like an attention seeker (at/on anywhere e.g Facebook, in person etc). If he/she asks you a question answer it and be polite. Ask open questions such as 'How was your day?' 'What are you doing tonight' and 'What are you up to?'. Also, make compliments. Say things like 'I really like your hair', 'Hey, nice jacket' and 'You're really good at ______, I wish I could be as good as you'. Get close to them.;
, You don't want to go over the top on your outfit, accessories/jewelry if wanted. If you're a boy, keep your hair neat, tidy and smelling nice. There's nothing worse than having a guy who doesn't wash or comb his hair. And if you're a girl, have it down if just washed or put it in a ponytail/plait if greasy and you absolutely don't have any time to wash it.
 Say 'Hi' when you're with them smile and make a conversation, if you're out walking don't look at other guys/girls flirtatiously as you go past, you don't want him/her to think you're not interested in him/her. Make sure you keep a good conversation and don't say any 'conversation killers' when you're just getting in to it. But when it's starting to fade off, don't start it up again, this may get annoying. Unless he/she doesn't mind.
 Ask them about themselves. Find out what their favourite type of music, food/drink, programme, movie/film.. etc. He/she might even tell you about some little individual funny thing about her/him.

 Having it in the air is critical, because if the slime blocks touch the ground, then they cannot move.;
, Then place a sticky piston on that block facing the opposite direction of the piston previously placed.
 Then place a slime block on top of that, a slime block on top of the first sticky piston, and another slime block on top of that.
 Then place another sticky piston facing the same direction. Make sure it is touching the slime block on the very top of the flying machine.
 Then the machine should be powered. Enjoy!

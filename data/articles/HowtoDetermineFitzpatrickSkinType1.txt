 Get a piece of paper and a pen or pencil, and write down your points as you go through the following questions. First, gaze into a mirror and look at the color of your eyes. Assign yourself the correct number of points based on your eye color using this point system:Light blue, light green, or light grey = 0 points
Blue, grey, or green = 1 point
Hazel or light brown = 2 points
Dark brown = 3 points
Brownish black = 4 points;
, Consider the color that your hair is naturally, without any coloring or dye. If your hair is dyed, look at your roots – the hair that has grown out from your scalp since your last coloring. Assign yourself points based on the following for your natural hair color:Light blonde or red = 0 points
Blonde = 1 point
Dark blonde or light brown = 2 points
Dark brown = 3 points
Black = 4 points

, Find an area of your skin that doesn’t get exposed to the sun. Look at skin that’s usually hidden beneath clothes or a bathing suit, such as your bottom. Give yourself points for your natural, pre-sun skin color:Ivory white = 0 points
Pale or fair = 1 point
Fair to beige with golden undertones = 2 points
Light brown or olive = 3 points
Dark brown or black = 4 points

, Look for freckles on that same area of skin that doesn’t get much sun exposure. You don’t have to literally count them – just observe and get an idea of how many freckles you have on those covered areas. Give yourself the appropriate points:Many freckles (covering most of your skin) = 0 points
Several freckles (lots, but not all over) = 1 point
A few freckles (some scattered here and there) = 2 points
Very few freckles (only about 1-3 on a large area) = 3 points
None = 4 points

, Think back to times you spent in the sun. Ask yourself, “Of all the times I spent in the sun, how often did I get a sunburn?” This will give you an idea of how your skin responds to the sun. Assign yourself points based on which statement best describes your skin:"I always burn, blister, and peel" = 0 points
"I often burn, blister, and peel" = 1 point
"I sometimes burn" = 2 points
"I burn rarely, if at all" = 3 points
"I never burn" = 4 points

, Now think about whether you tan when you’re in the sun – whether spending time in the sun makes your skin get darker. It doesn’t matter if you get a little tan or very tan, just consider whether you tan at all. Give yourself points based on which statement best describes you:"I never tan, I always burn" = 0 points
"I seldom get tan" = 1 point
"I sometimes get tan" = 2 points
"I often get tan" = 3 points
"I always get tan" = 4 points

, Now consider how deeply you tan – whether sun makes your skin a little darker or much darker. Determine which statement best describes you and give yourself the right number of points:"I tan very little or not at all" = 0 points
"I tan lightly" = 1 point
"I tan moderately" = 2 points
"I tan deeply" = 3 points
"My skin is naturally dark" = 4 points

, Think about whether your face is sensitive to the sun. Ask yourself questions like, “Do I have to wear sunscreen on my face every day?” and “Does sunlight cause me to breakout or have skin changes?” Give yourself points for how sensitive your face is to the sun:Very sensitive = 0 points
Sensitive = 1 point
Normal = 2 points
Resistant = 3 points
Very resistant, never had a problem = 4 points

, Tally up all the points you scored from the above questions. Match your total number of points to the corresponding Fitzpatrick Skin Type:0-6 points = Type I
7-12 points = Type II
13-18 points = Type III
19-24 points: Type IV
25-30 points: Type V
31 points or higher: Type VI

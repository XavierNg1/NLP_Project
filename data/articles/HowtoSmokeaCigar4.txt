 Hold the cigar up to your mouth and draw in the smoke. Then, hold it in your mouth for a few seconds to taste it, and then let it go. Do not inhale the cigar smoke. A cigar is not like a cigarette. The flavor is meant to be savored, but not inhaled.
 Continue to do this to keep the cigar in good form. Remember that a good cigar can last 2 to 3 hours.
 The band is placed on the cigar to prevent the tobacco from tearing, but you won't need it anymore once you lit the cigar. After twelve or so puffs, the band will already be starting to fall off on its own due to the heat.
 Though you're not required to enjoy your cigar with an alcoholic beverage, an alcoholic beverage can enhance the smoking experience and can bring out the flavors of the cigar. Some great beverages for smoking a cigar include port, cognac, bourbon or scotch, or red wine -- especially Cabernet Sauvignon.








A coffee-based beverage -- or even coffee -- can also bring out the flavor in a cigar.
Though a cigar can overpower the flavor of many beers, an India Pale Ale (IPA) beer is a perfect companion to almost any cigar.
Any drink that involves Kahlua will be a great companion to a cigar.
You can also enjoy your cigar with a Martini.
 Simply set it aside in the ashtray. The cigar will extinguish itself after a minute or two without you puffing on it. Before you set it down, gently blow through the cigar to expel any smoke that will go stale. Relighting a cigar after this period has passed generally results in a strong, bitter taste; as a result, most aficionados prefer to throw out a smoked cigar.

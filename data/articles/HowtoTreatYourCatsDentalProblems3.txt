 If the buildup of tartar is thick enough on the teeth it can physically obstruct the mouth from closing. You may get a clue this is about to happen when your cat spends a lot of time working his jaw up and down when not eating, or if there is a "clicking" sound as he opens and closes his mouth.


Tartar also contains bacteria, which means that when it rubs against your cat's gums, it can cause infections.
 This involves an ultrasonic descaler machine using high frequency sound to blitz the tartar off the teeth without scratching or damaging the enamel. This is an atraumatic process (it shouldn't cause pain).


However to gain access to all the tooth surfaces, the cat needs to have a general anesthetic, and hence this procedure needs to take place at a veterinary clinic.
 This process has a greater risk of damaging the enamel, scraping the gums, and generally not getting the teeth particularly clean. However, it does have its place if a localized lump of tartar is causing problems. Debulking refers to cracking off (using dental forceps, which are like blunt pincers) in order to remove a lump of tartar that is rubbing against another tooth or causing a sore on the inside of the cheek.


There is no particular rule for doing this, other than inserting a blunt point between the gum and the tartar and applying sharp pressure parallel to the tooth in the direction away from the gum. It should be noted that few cats enjoy having this done and are likely to show their disapproval by hissing or growling.

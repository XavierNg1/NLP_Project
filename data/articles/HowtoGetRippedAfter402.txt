 With a good plan, you can do this safely, without sacrificing the nutrition your body needs. There are several diets you can try, like Paleo. Eat more fruits or vegetables.
 For every one to two days of the week, replace your meals with only smoothies. Add as many fruits or ingredients you would like. 3-4 smoothies is the recommendation.
 If you use weights, make sure they are very light, and continue to do reps until you are tired.
 Swimming or high-intensity aerobic exercises. You can run for as long as you want or as fast as you want.
 Cut it out, completely, until you reach your goal. When you're at your goal weight, consume it in moderation.

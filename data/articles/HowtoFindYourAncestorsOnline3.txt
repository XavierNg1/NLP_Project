 Researching your ancestry will likely leave you with a lot of paperwork, which can pile up and get disorganized easily. Invest in a filing cabinet or file folders to organize your documents, either by year, or type of document. Be sure to file documents as soon as you find them to avoid losing papers or getting sections mixed up, and try to date copies of documents to track your research., An excellent option for organizing your ancestry-related findings is to purchase genealogy software. There are many different options available that record and organize information and facilitate the sharing of family history data. Read online reviews to determine what software will best serve you in your research., Making a family tree is a way to present your ancestry-related findings visually, clearly charting marriage and parentage over generations. Each generation is generally depicted across a single, horizontal line, with lines and brackets indicating marriage and children. Depending on your intended use for the chart (e.g. as a gift for a family member or simply a visual reference for yourself), you may opt to make a family tree by hand or online., Once your research has allowed you to identify your ancestors and family history, consider writing a book about the information is a good way to record and present your findings. Most publications of this type are produced only for family members; very few traditional publishers will pay to publish family histories unless there is a broad, marketable appeal. You will likely have to pay a price per copy to have a book published, which will in turn make the book available to distant relatives who search for details about their ancestry.You might also consider publishing an eBook, or simply printing copies of your book for friends and family.

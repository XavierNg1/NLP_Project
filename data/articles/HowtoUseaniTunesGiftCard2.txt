,,, Enter the 16 digit gift card code that is on the back of the card in the box marked CODE at the bottom of this screen. The amount of the gift card will be applied to your iTunes account. When you purchase songs or other media, iTunes will automatically deduct the cost from your gift card first until the card reaches a zero balance. Check the remaining balance by looking at your account.
 Begin using your gift card to purchase a variety of items through the iTunes store. You can buy music, music videos, movies, books and more. Be sure that you pay attention to how much money is left on your account, as well as to the cost of any potential purchases. This will keep you from going over the limit.

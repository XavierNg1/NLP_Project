 Deluge is a torrent client that works on various platforms, including Mac, Windows, and Linux.


If you don’t like Deluge, there are many other torrent clients to choose from.
 Trackers are sites that have the torrent files used to connect you other people who already have the file video. Some sites specialize in searching through torrent trackers to find the files you are looking for.


Trackers do not host any video files themselves, which is why you need to the torrent client.
 Look for a “Download Torrent” button on the torrent page.


Make sure that any torrent you download has seeders. Seeders are peers who have the completed file on their computer available to you for download. Torrent trackers will display the number of seeders on a torrent’s page (usually in a column titled “Seeders” or “S”).
 Double click the torrent file and it will automatically open with your client and start the connections to download.


If torrent files are not set to open automatically with Deluge, you can click “Add” in the upper left of the torrent client and browse for the torrent file on your computer.
Torrents with more seeders will typically download faster.
You can change the location of files downloaded by Deluge by clicking “Preferences” in the top options bar.

 Your knees should be at a right angle when you are sitting on the ball with your feet facing forward. Stand against a wall with no shoes on and your feet flat against the floor and wall. Use a pencil to mark the sport that the top of your head reaches. Use a tape measure to get an accurate measurement of your height.;
, Use your measurement to get the yoga ball in an appropriate size.


If you are 5 feet (1.5 m) or shorter (152.4 cm), you will want a ball that is 18 inches (45 cm).
If you are 5 feet (1.5 m) 1 inch (155 cm) to 5 feet (1.5 m) 7 inches (170 cm), try a 22 inch (55 cm) ball.
Get a 26 inch ball (65 cm) if you are between 5 feet (1.5 m) 8 inches (173 cm) and 6 feet (1.8 m) 1 inch (185 cm).
If you are 6 feet (1.8 m) 2 inches or taller, you will need a ball that measures 30 inches (75 cm).
, Because the ball will deflate when you sit on it, choose a ball that has a diameter which is 4 inches (10 cm) larger than the height of the chair you are replacing.
 At its maximum diameter, a yoga ball is very firm. The firmer the ball, the more difficult the yoga and exercise will be.
 Sit on the ball and see if your hips and knees are bent to 90 degrees, with your thighs parallel to the floor.

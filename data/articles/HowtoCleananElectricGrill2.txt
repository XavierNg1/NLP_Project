 Make sure your electric grill is turned off, before you start cleaning it. Locate the power button and flip it off.
 While the grill is slightly warm, scrape the cooking grates down with a stainless steel grill brush.
 An outdoor electric grill will likely have a removable liner underneath the grates. Take this piece off and use a rubber spatula to scrape off any excess, dropped food pieces. If it’s especially dirty, wash it with a wet soapy sponge., Use a damp cloth to wipe the lid down. Make sure the cloth does not drip and never immerse this part in water.
 If your grill is not very dirty, you may be able to skip this step. If it is, take the grates off and wash them with a wet sponge and dish soap. Scrape with a stainless steel brush as needed.
 Before you put the removable liner or grates back on and use your grill again, make sure it’s completely dry. Use a dry dishrag or paper towel to thoroughly dry it.
 To remove all dried, burnt-on food residue, use a concoction of vinegar and baking soda by mixing 2 cups (470 mL) vinegar to 1 cup (240 mL) baking soda in a trash bag. Tie the dirty grates in the bag and leave it overnight. Dried on residue should fall off easily in the morning.

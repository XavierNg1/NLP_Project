 Having routines in your life helps you cope with the trauma by giving you regular events to look forward to and by giving you stability. Continue any routines you had before the traumatic event and create new routines to help you cope.Get together with friends and family on a regular basis. For example, have dinner with your family every weekend or go to the gym with a friend twice a week.
Have specific days and times that you do things. For example, check your email in the morning, bathe the dog on Thursday evenings, or clean up on the weekends.
Schedule time for journaling and other coping strategies like meditation, counseling sessions, or support groups.
If you break a routine, don't beat up on yourself. Simply try to get back on schedule tomorrow.
 One common symptom of trauma is insomnia and problems sleeping. Coupling insomnia with the stress of the traumatic event can be extremely harmful to you. Having a regular bedtime and waking time is one way to return to normal life and cope with the traumatic event.Try stretching, taking a warm bath, or doing something relaxing before you lie down for bed. Put away electronic devices an hour before bed, as the blue light emitted from smartphones, tablets, laptops, TVs, and similar devices make it difficult for you to fall asleep.
If you have problems sleeping that last more than a few days, consult a medical professional for help.
 Many people experience changes in their eating habits after a traumatic event.Some people eat to cope with the stress, while others lose their appetite and have trouble eating.


Make sure you are getting regular meals throughout the day.
Try to eat healthy foods like fruits and vegetables that will provide your body with the nutrients it needs to function at its best.

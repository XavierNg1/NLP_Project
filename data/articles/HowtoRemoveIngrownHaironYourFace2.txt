 You may also use spot exfoliation to help remove the ingrown hair. Remember to be very careful with the area. Use gentle, circular motions to try and dislodge the hair. Make a natural exfoliant at home instead of buying something from the store.Mix Â½ teaspoon of baking soda, sea salt, or sugar with one to two tablespoons of olive oil. Use a Q-tip or cotton ball to apply the mixture to the infected ingrown hair.
Use the tips of one or two fingers to gently rub the exfoliating mixture using circular motions. First, rub in using three to five clockwise motions. Then reverse, using three to five counterclockwise motions.
Rinse off with warm water and pat.
 If you have an ingrown hair, you can start trying to get it out by using honey. Honey not only moisturizes the skin, but it also acts as an antibacterial. This helps prevent infection. The honey also helps to loosen and draw out the free end of the hair.Use a Q-tip to apply a small amount of honey onto the ingrown hair. Allow it to remain for 20 to 30 minutes, or until it is dried.
Rinse the honey off with warm water and pat dry. Repeat twice a day.
 One of the things you want to make sure you are not doing is over-drying your skin. Over-drying your skin can make the ingrown hair harder to extract. You want to keep the skin moist while you are trying to get the hair out. Use a bit of moisturizer on the infected hair after every treatment.This can help soften the skin and can reduce the risk of skin damage and scarring.

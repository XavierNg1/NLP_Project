 You may have injured your jaw by falling, getting in a car accident, being assaulted, or suffering from a sports or recreational injury. You will most definitely know if you have broken your jaw. If you think you may have broken your jaw, you may be experiencing some of the following symptoms:A swollen or bruised face
Problems opening your mouth wide or closing your mouth
Loose or damaged teeth
Numbness on your face, particularly in your lower lip area
Jaw pain or tenderness that is worse when you bite or chew
Bleeding from your mouth
Pain in your face or jaw that gets worse when you move
A lump or abnormal appearance of your cheek or jaw
Upper and lower teeth do not match up when you bite down;
, Hold your jaw in place with your hands or use a bandage. Wrap the bandage under your jaw and over the top of your head. Be careful not to wrap the bandage too tight. You may feel the urge to throw up because of your injury, so you need to be able to easily remove the bandage.Keeping your jaw stabilized can prevent any further injury until you can get to the emergency room.
If you do not have a bandage, try using a scarf, neck tie, or handkerchief.
 A cold compress can help reduce swelling. Keep the ice or cold compress on for 15 to 20 minutes at a time.If you are using ice, wrap the ice in a towel first to prevent frostbite.Lightly place the compress on your jaw. Too much pressure can cause more pain and damage.
If you don't have an ice pack or compress, you can use a bag of frozen vegetables, like peas or corn.

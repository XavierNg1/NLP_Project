 Try to choose characters with an ambiguous identity or description, so that you can reuse them in other puppet shows. You can find figures anywhere, but the Internet has a wealth of options available at the touch of a button.;
, On a piece of paper, trace out the figure to the desired size. You may like to reinforce the paper with card, or draw it directly on to card, so that the paper doesn't flap around during your performance.


Think about the back side, too! Will your puppet be turning around during use? And if you do make a back side, does it need fins or a tail?

, If a circular shape would aid well to your project, consider using this sturdy, textured material. It works well for fish, crabs, clams, and other plump creatures.


If you use two, it gives ultimate volume. Cut a slit to the center and reglue them together with a bit of overlap. Taking a section out forces the paper to bend into more of a shallow cone shape. Place the wide sides together to form the body of your animal.
 Color is an important part of any puppet show. Make your characters bright and interesting, so that the audience's eye is pleased.
 Find a clear plastic straw and attach it to the back of the puppet with cello-tape or blue tack. Be sure that it is long enough that your hand is some distance from the actual puppet. You don't want your arm in the show!


Alternatively, get some fishing wire and attach it to your puppet so you can hold it from the top. This, however, requires you to stand up while performing.
 For eyes, use the googly kind (attach with glue). If you're making a Puffer Fish, like in the pictures, consider using straws cut down at an angle to about 2" (5 cm) and attached all over the body.Cut some small fins out of your paper or paper plate. Tada!

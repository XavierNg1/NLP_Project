 These compounds are built off of groups of atoms that are bonded together, and the entire group has a positive or negative charge. You can do three basic things to polyatomic compounds:


Add a hydrogen to the beginning of the compound. The word “hydrogen” is added to the beginning of the compound name. This reduces the negative charge by one. For example, “carbonate” CO32- becomes “hydrogen carbonate” HCO3-.






Remove an oxygen from the compound. The charge stays the same and the ending of the compound changes from “-ate” to “–ite”. For example: NO3 to NO2 goes from “nitrate” to “nitrite.”






Replace the central atom with another from the same periodic group. For example, sulfate SO42- can become Selenate SeO42-.
 These are the basis for forming most polyatomic compounds. Listed in order of increasing negative charge, they are:


Hydroxide ion: OH-

Nitrate ion: NO3-

Hydrogen carbonate ion: HCO3-

Permanganate ion: MnO4-

Carbonate ion: CO32-

Chromate ion: CrO42-

Dichromate ion: Cr2O72-

Sulfate ion: SO42-

Sulphite ion: SO32-

Thiosulfate ion: S2O3<2-
Phosphate ion: PO43-

Ammonium ion: NH4+


, Associate whatever element(s) is attached to the group ion and name accordingly. If the element comes in front of the ion group, the name of the element is simply added to the beginning of the compound name.

Example: KMnO4. You should recognize the MnO4- ion as permanganate. K is potassium, so the compound is named potassium permanganate.






Example: NaOH. You should recognize the OH- ion as hydroxide. Na is sodium, so the compound is named sodium hydroxide.

 Smiling has a two sided effect: you look more pleasant, and you feel more pleasant. Smiling makes others more comfortable because it gives you the appearance of being comfortable. When you smile, you tighten the muscles in your cheek which decreases the flow of blood to the cavernous sinus. This cools the blood flowing into your brain which leads to pleasant feelings., If you notice yourself in a non-pleasant situation, remember to keep your face pleasant. Simply placing the muscles of your face in the pattern of pleasant emotion elicits the feeling. In other words, facial expression influences your mood., Constantly fidgeting with your clothes or adjusting your hair every other minute will take away from your pleasant expression. People will read that youâ€™re uncomfortable and begin to doubt your expressions. Carrying confidence to back up your pleasant expression will give you a demeanor that makes others comfortable and engaged.

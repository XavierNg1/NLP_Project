 Get a CD or DVD that is compatible with the LightScribe program and insert it into the disk drive in the normal way, with the data side pointing down.
 Using conventional CD or DVD burning programs such as iTunes, burn the songs, videos or other media that you want onto the compact disk.
 Take the disc out of the drive. Flip it over and place it back in so that the data side is pointing up., Once you've finished designing your label with the label design application you chose, there should be an option to preview the label. The preview option helps you to see what the cover will look like before it is printed. Use the preview to decide if you need to make any final edits. Make sure that you are happy with your chosen design., You can then click the option on your label design application to burn the label into the top of the CD or DVD. Use the Print command on the LightScribe application. Be aware that the printing will take several minutes or more. The application will tell you when the printing is finished.

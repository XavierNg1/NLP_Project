 Smear the lip balm over a thin or non-watertight section of fabric for a quick fix. This will only be marginally and temporarily effective, but it might keep you just dry enough in a pinch. Make sure that your gear is dry and clean when you start – otherwise, the Chapstick won't be able to do much!

, There are a lot of zippers involved in survival gear—tents, jackets, backpacks—and these closing mechanisms are prone to getting caught on the surrounding fabric. Chapstick can act as a lubricant that might help you free the zipper from a tight spot. Use lip balm liberally, but don't expect it to fix all of your zipper woes.


As an added bonus, the waxy coating might make the zipper more water-resistant.
You can also use Chapstick to lubricate screws, tools, and other things that might get stuck.

This should get the glass clean, and it may also keep them from fogging up.Be aware that this tip is not officially verified; it shouldn't damage your glasses, but the thick petroleum might gunk up the lenses and make it hard to see.

Make sure to rinse out the compartment beforehand to remove the waxy residue. If the lid is intact, try using the container to hold basic survival gear: a fishing hook, a waterproof match, a band-aid, and some fishing line.Try hiding cash in here if you're traveling. Fold paper bills and roll them in. This can be a discreet way to keep your money close and safe.

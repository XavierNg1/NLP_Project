 Lay your sheet of plywood on a few 2x4s suspended over two sawhorses. The entire sheet of plywood should be seated firmly on the work surface.A plunge cut is a cut that does not start from a straight edge, but the center of a sheet of plywood. If you need to make an opening in the middle of a sheet of plywood, for example, you would need to make a plunge cut., Lower the blade to about .25 inches (0.6Â cm) more than the thickness of your sheet. This will ensure the teeth of the blades just barely cut through the underside of the surface.
 There is a high risk of kick back, or the saw running back towards you, when making a plunge cut. Do not stand directly behind the saw when you make a plunge cut., Place the front edge of the shoe, or the base plate of the saw, against your sheet of plywood. Carefully lift up the blade guard, and line the blade up with your cut mark., You won't be able to see what is beneath the sheet as you make your plunge cut, so check before hand to make sure the space is clear., Turn the saw on and slowly lower the saw blade into the sheet. Hold the saw firmly to keep it from kicking back to you.Once the saw is completely lowered into the cut, and the saw bed is flush with the cutting surface, release the blade guard. Move the saw forward to finish the cut. Let the blade come to a complete stop before lifting the saw out of the sheet.

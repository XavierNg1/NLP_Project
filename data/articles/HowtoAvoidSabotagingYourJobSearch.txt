 Be proactive. Follow up inquiries, take the opportunity to broaden your network, and put yourself 'out there'.;
, Don't take what you may have heard someone say, as gospel. You aren't too old, too young, too experienced, too inexperienced.
 Your unemployment will not last forever. The job that you may be blowing off as not the perfect job could very well lead to one that is. Even if it doesn't, you can valuable experience with every position you hold.
 This works with not holding out. Today's work environment is changing almost exponentially. The more flexible you are in your job search and in your job, the better off you are.
 Remember that you need to be the answer that someone is seeking. Make it all about them.
 That may be very hard, but it is necessary. If you need to, take a short break, but keep it very short. Maybe take an afternoon off to go sightseeing. Keep moving and don't let depression take hold.

 The placemat can be more casual than it would be for a formal table. A solid-colored cloth placemat will do.
 You can fold a cloth or a paper napkin in halves or fourths.
 The plate doesn't have to be ornate or elaborate. Just try to use matching plates for all of the settings.
 You'll only need to use one fork for a casual meal.
 The blade of the knife should face the plate, just as it would in a formal setting.
 If no soup will be served with the meal, then eliminate this utensil.
 The dessert spoon should be substantially smaller and less concave than the soup spoon.
 The dessert fork should be substantially smaller than the dinner fork. It should be directly below the dessert spoon without touching it.
 For a more casual setting, the wine glass can be stemless.
 It should be placed further back than the wine glass, and to the left of the wine glass. The water glass should be slightly larger than the regular glass.

 There are two ways to sew a hem: by hand or with a sewing machine. While the latter is obviously faster, the former allows you to sew a hem without many tools. If you can, set up your sewing machine for your hem; use a straight stitch for a double-fold hem.;
, Lay out your clothing on a countertop pattern-side down, with the hem/edge in front of you. Fold the fabric edge up ⅝-inch, and use an iron to flatten it out. Then, starting from the edge, create a second fold over the first ⅝-inch wide, so that the raw edge of the first fold is hidden under the second fold.









⅝-inch is the standard seam allowance, but you can use whatever measurement you want for your hem.
 Use multiple straight pins to secure this fold. Insert the pins so that the blunt end (often with a pearl) sticks out from the hem, while the needle-end of the pin is inserted towards the fabric. This will make them much easier to remove as you sew (if you’re using a sewing machine).
 Either with your sewing machine or by hand, use a matching thread to your fabric and sew a straight stitch along the top edge of the fold. Work all the way around until you’ve sewn the whole hem, and then tie off and cut your thread.
 You’re almost done! To finish off your hem, you need to iron it so it lays down flat. If your fabric can handle it, use a bit of steam to help with the ironing process. When you’re done ironing, turn your fabric right-side-out, and enjoy your newly completed hem.

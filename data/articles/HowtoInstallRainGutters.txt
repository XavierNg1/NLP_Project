 Rain gutters should be attached to the fascia and run the entire length of the roof, ending with a downspout. If a gutter run will measure longer than 40 feet (12.2 m), the gutter should be positioned to pitch down from the middle, aimed toward a downspout at each end. A fascia bracket will be attached to every other rafter tail, or approximately every 32 inches (81.3 cm).;

Locate the starting point, or highest point, of the gutter run.
Mark the point on the fascia, 1.25 inches (3.2 cm) below the roof flashing.
Locate the ending point, or the downspout location, of the gutter run.
Mark the low end point on the fascia, while calculating the slope of the gutter .25 inches (0.6 cm) for every 10 feet (3.0 m) of length.
Snap a chalk line between the two points.
 Use a hacksaw, or heavy duty tin snips to cut the gutter at the appropriate measurement.
 Brackets will either snap onto the gutters or will be mounted into the face board first, depending on the type of gutters you purchase. Review the manufacturer's recommendations for your type of gutter.
 Use a jigsaw to cut a square opening at the appropriate place in the gutter.
 An end cap should be used on any open-ended run of gutter.
 A bracket should be mounted to the face board every 18-to-24 inches (61.0 cm). Use a stainless steel lag screw long enough to penetrate the face board at least 2 inches (5.1 cm).
 Make sure the tapered end of the downspout is facing down and aimed in the appropriate direction.

 When your shoes don't fit you, your feet could sweat more than usual (aside from being incredibly uncomfortable). Get fitted before buying shoes and don't be afraid to see a podiatrist if your feet begin to hurt you.;
, It's not a horribly revolutionary idea, but wearing shoes with more breathable fabrics will cut down on foot-sweat and odor. Synthetic fabrics usually do not breathe well. The most breathable fabrics include:


Cotton
Linen
Leather
Hemp.

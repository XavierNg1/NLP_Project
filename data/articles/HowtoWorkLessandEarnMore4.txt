 The simplest way to earn more is to ask that your pay increase.You will be more successful if you can make a good case why you should earn more. Ask for a raise after a positive performance review, after you've landed a great client, after you've gotten a job offer elsewhere, or after you have earned an additional certification. Do your research about what employees at your level are earning, and use your research to determine how much more money you will ask for.


Speak confidently and professionally. Underselling yourself or whining will not help your case.Have a plan in case your request is denied. Decide whether you are willing to walk away from this job and take another one instead. If not, be sure that you remain professional., Track when you are feeling most energized and when you are feeling sluggish. Rearrange your schedule so that you complete your most difficult tasks during the optimal times. Use the sluggish part of your day to do mundane, routine tasks.This will help you be more productive at work, and potentially work fewer hours.
 Batching your tasks will allow you to remain in the groove and finish each task more quickly.Structure your time effectively and efficiently, and perform similar tasks all at once.


For example, take care of your emails all at once instead of one at a time throughout the day. Scattering your email replies over several hours will distract you from your other tasks.
 Deadlines are an effective way to combat procrastination and make your work hours count. Deadlines are even more effective when they are imposed by external factors.Give yourself tight but realistic deadlines, and try to complete tasks more quickly. The more efficient you are at work, the more quickly you can go home for the day.

 Measure 1 cup (140 g) of sunflower seeds and 1 cup (140 g) of raw almonds into a large bowl. Pour enough water to cover the seeds and nuts by 2 inches (5 cm). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and let it sit out at room temperature overnight.At a minimum, try to soak the seeds and nuts for at least 8 to 10 hours.;
, Set a fine mesh strainer in the sink and pour the soaked seeds and nuts through it. You don't need to save the soaking liquid. Transfer the seeds and nuts to a small food processor. Put the lid on and pulse them until they're finely ground.You may need to stop and scrape down the sides of the food processor.
 Put the ground seeds and nuts into a large bowl along with the rest of the salad ingredients. Stir the ingredients together to completely combine the mixture. You'll need:1/3 cup (75 g) finely chopped celery
1/3 cup (47 g) finely chopped pickles
1/4 cup (40 g) finely chopped red onion
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
2 tablespoons maple syrup or agave nectar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon kelp granules
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon sea salt

, Set the mock tuna salad out as a dip for crackers or vegetable sticks. You could also use it as a sandwich filling or topping for a fresh green salad. If you'd like to make the salad ahead of time and store it, cover the bowl and refrigerate it until you're ready to use it.You can store the mock tuna salad for up to 5 days in the refrigerator. Keep in mind that it may lose a little crunch the longer it chills.

, This is the most commonly used technique. It is also the simplest. The illustration indicates its form.
 This is an effective weave on large surfaces, and in bands or patterns of the same or a contrasting colour on plain rattan baskets.
 Two weavers are started behind two succeeding spokes, and crossed between them, so that what was the under weaver becomes the upper weaver each time.
 Here, three weavers are placed behind three consecutive spokes, starting with the back one, over two and under one spoke, each on its way to the back of the third spoke being laid over the other two weavers. In turning up the sides of large baskets where separate spokes or additional spokes have been inserted, or as a strong top for scrap baskets, this weave is invaluable.

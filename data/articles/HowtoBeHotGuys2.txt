 Try watching some movies that feature really hot actors. Imitate the way that they look at the ladies, and you'll be golden.
 Smile with a closed mouth, and don't smile too widely. Also, let one corner of your mouth go slightly higher than the other.
 Walk with some space between your legs and move more slowly. You'll exude confidence with your swagger, and you'll drive women crazy.
 A man who stands upright looks confident, while a slouch shows that he is insecure and uncomfortable. Developing good posture will give the impression that you think you're attractive, which will in turn influence girls to think the same.
 Avoid imitating radio announcers or newscasters. Instead, imitate the voice of a sexy man in cinema. The ladies will turn just to see who's talking, and they will melt when you engage them in conversation.
 If the woman you're talking to becomes emotional or prickly, stay in control of yourself. You're much more likely to score when you remain unruffled by her emotional swings.

 Before buying a puppy, you should make sure that it is old enough to be taken away from its mother and the rest of its litter. The first 8 weeks of a puppy's life should be spent with its mother and siblings. During this initial period it will pick up social skills, be weaned from its mother, grow teeth, and start eating solid food., When you pick your puppy from a litter, look for one who seems even tempered and avoid extreme behaviour (too energetic, or too withdrawn and skittish). Note that Doberman Pinschers, as a breed, are known for being alert, loyal, and aggressive when protecting loved ones. Spend time with your potential new puppy away from the rest of the litter to get a feel for its individual personality., Some breeders opt to dock the tails of their Doberman Pinscher puppies, so you should decide what your own feelings about it are before purchasing a puppy. This process usually happens days, or even hours, after a puppy is born; it involves tying a band around the tail to cut off circulation, which results in the tail falling off after a few days. This choice is aesthetically-motivated and practical, preventing injury that might occur to a longer tail. Many oppose this practice, which is illegal in several countries like Sweden, Greece, and Ireland., Consider adopting a Doberman Pinscher puppy instead of buying one- the cost will be much lower than buying a puppy from a breeder, and you will be giving a home to a dog that desperately needs love and nurturing. Contact dog rescue groups in your area to ask about Doberman Pinscher puppies, or for a referral to other rescue groups that might deal with the breed.

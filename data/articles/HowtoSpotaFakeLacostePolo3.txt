 Lacoste polos are designed in France, which sizes in numbers. Above the crocodile, you should see a red number such as “4.” If the polo uses words like small, medium, or large, it is a fake., The crocodile should be an olive green color. Again, it will have noticeable claws, teeth, a red mouth, and white scales on its back. Make sure the crocodile’s outline looks smooth instead of lumpy. An authentic one also won’t have rough lines disrupting the coloring.High-quality fakes look similar, but study them closely. They won’t be quite as detailed. The crocodile may look a little squashed. The white eyes and scales tend to look rough and too close together.
 If the polo has a second tag, it’ll rest under the first one. The first line should say “Designed In France.” These words should not be covered up by the first tag. The second line will say “Made In” along with a country, which is usually El Salvador or Peru. Lacoste polos made in France are rare.

Not all polos have this second tag. Many polos now have a wide tag with the logo, so use other methods to identify them.
 The tag is on the bottom and inside the shirt. When you find it, you will first see “100% cotton” printed in seven languages. On the back, you’ll see washing instructions with the word Devanlay, which is the company’s name. No fabric should cover the letters on the tag.Fake shirts may have the washing instructions on the tag’s front. The tags may also be roughly sewn in with threads that hang down or obstruct letters.
The tag may be above small triangle cuts on the side of the shirt. Make sure these cuts are small and don’t have loose threads hanging from them.

 Many phones do not come with an IR blaster. To know if your phone has one, check your device and look for a glossy black piece of plastic on the top somewhere. It may not be very large in some cases. On the LG G3, for example, the IR Blaster is about the size of the tip of a pen.


Alternatively, you can check the device’s user’s manual. If you don’t have the manual anymore, look it up on the Internet.;
, Launch Google Play on your device and search for “IR blaster.” Several IR remote apps will appear in the list. Each app may be a little bit different as far as what devices they control and the method it uses to customize your remote controls. Some requires entering codes while others will have presets that you can cycle through to find your device.


Pick an app and install it. You may have to try a few different ones before you find the one that best suits you.
Please note that not all apps are universal apps. Some work only with specific brands. Make sure to read the description of the app before installing.
All IR Blasters, regardless of the model of device they are installed on, should work in the same manner. You do not have to have a Samsung phone to control a Samsung TV, for example.
 Tap the app to open it after installation. The IR blaster won’t be active without an app.
 Just like a normal remote control, the IR blaster will work best when you are holding the device correctly. Most of the time, the IR blaster will be at the top of the device. Simply point and press the keys on the screen of your Android to control the device you choose.


TVs, DVD/Blu-ray players, audio receivers, and much more can be controlled using an IR blaster. However, not all applications are created equal and so some may be simple to set up while others are not. The next method will give an example of a good app to start with.

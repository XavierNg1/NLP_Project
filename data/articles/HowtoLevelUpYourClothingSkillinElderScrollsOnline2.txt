 You are going to need crafting material, style gems, and trait gems if you wish to add a trait to your armor.

Crafting material can be refined, or found in crates and bags around the world or on fallen enemies.
Style gems can be found as you explore the world.
Trait gems are harder to come across; you can find them from looting.
 You can look at your map in any town and find it by looking for the icon that resembles a pair of scissors cutting thread. You could also walk around town and look for a table that has hide stretched across it, and scissors and other crafting materials on it., When you find the Clothing Station, hit A to activate the Clothing menu., Select the second option down that says “Creation.” You will be shown a menu with four boxes that you have to make selections on before you can create armor., You can make a robe, shirt, shoes, gloves, hats, breeches, arm caps, and more. Pick the item you want to make by going left or right on the controller until you highlight the item you want to create., Go to the second box, which is where you will select your material. Use the directional buttons to highlight the item, and press A., Each race has their own style, so use the appropriate gem for the proper style. For example, Khajits need moonstone for their style., You do not need to pick a trait, but having a trait on your item will make it stronger. You can add extra defense and buffs by using trait gems., Hit the X button to craft your item when you pick everything out for the piece of armor. Once the armor is crafted, you will get the item and a nice experience boost for your Clothing skill line.

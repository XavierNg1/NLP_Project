 Take along a friend or a family member;
, Grab the tape out of the sewing basket.
 Select according to your backpacking needs (size, weight, length of trip etc.) rather than how nice the colour is!

, As you try it on, tilt your chin forward toward your chest. The bone that sticks out at the top of your vertebrae (C7 vertebra) at the base of your neck as you do this is the point from which measuring commences.
 Have your friend draw it down to the top of your hipbones. Imagine a line between your hipbones that meets in the middle of your back - this is where the tape measure should be placed.
, Depending on the measurement read-out, you may find it a good backpack or you may wish to try another one. Hiking backpacks are not cheap and a lot goes into deciding to buy one. Proper fit is the number one consideration but you should also consider weight, pockets, room etc.

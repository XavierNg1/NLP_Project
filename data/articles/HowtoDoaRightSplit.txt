 You cannot expect that you are going to make it to the floor without any pain at all. You will not make it to the floor, and if you try to do a split right away, it will hurt a lot!;
, Reach for your toes, sit down with your feet in front of you and put your head towards your knees and reach out.
 You have two choices to do a split if you're doing a left or right split. You can either slide down slowly to the ground with one foot in front of the other, or you can sit down with one foot extended out and then lift yourself up and extend the other leg. If you are doing a middle split, you also have two choices. You can either straddle your legs on the ground and then push them back until you feel a stretch, or you can start standing up with your feet together and gradually spread them apart and use your hands to support you.
, This will take time, but if you work at it, you will eventually be able to do a split.

 Open a new window on your browser and go to the Mediafire website and search for the Most Wanted Car Changer.;
,, Once the download is complete, go to your Downloads folder (for Windows, this is usually C:\Users\<User Name>\Downloads\). Find the appâ€™s exe file and open it by double-clicking.
 This will minimize the car changer app so you can launch the NFS game.


Remember that Most Wanted Car Changer must be running as you play the game so you can get the SWAT truck.
 You can launch the game from the Start menu (Start button >> All Programs >> Electronic Arts >> Need for Speed Most Wanted) or from the desktop by double-clicking its icon.


The game will launch directly into the game world, resuming your racing career from where you last stopped.
 This will put NFS: MW 2012 in window mode, allowing you to use the mouse and the minimize button to switch between the game and the Most Wanted Car Changer application., Since you minimized the program, it should be on your taskbar.
, You will have to scroll down a bit on the drop-down menu to find this option.
 This will confirm your selection.
 Now you can change the car you are currently driving to the SWAT truck you selected in the Car Changer.
 To do this, drive very fast (Up Arrow key to accelerate, Left and Right Arrow keys to steer left and right respectively) and hit another vehicle, or a wall, hard.


After the crash, you will respawn in the SWAT truck.

 The formula is speed=distancetime{\displaystyle {\text{speed}}={\frac {\text{distance}}{\text{time}}}}., This should be presented to you in the form of a coordinate plane. The graph should have at least one line plotted. The line represents the distance and time traveled by a single person or object. If the graph has multiple lines, each line represents a different person or object.

The first endpoint of the line signifies when the person or object started moving. The second endpoint of the line signifies when the person or object stopped moving.
 The x-axis is the horizontal axis, and it indicates the time spent travelling. The y-axis is the vertical axis, and it indicates the distance traveled.If the units of the graph are not listed in terms of meters per second, you will need to  convert the units after you find the speed.

The steeper the line on a distance-time graph, the faster the speed.A horizontal line indicates that there was no change in distance. This would indicate a speed of 0 meters per second., To calculate the distance, find the appropriate line on the graph and note the point where the line ends. Find the y-coordinate of this point by moving your finger horizontally to the y-axis. This will show you the distance travelled.If the line does not start at the (0, 0) point, you need to find the distance by subtracting the y-values of the two endpoints of the line.

For example, if the line showing the distance and time traveled by Henry begins at (0, 0) and ends at the point (1,800, 48,000), the number of meters traveled is 48,000.
 To calculate the time, go back to the point where the line ends. Find the x-coordinate of this point by moving your finger vertically to the x-axis. This will show you the time spent traveling.For example, if the line showing the distance and time traveled by Henry ends at the point (1,800, 48,000), the number of seconds traveled is 1,800.
 Plug the two values into the formula and divide. This will give you the speed. If the units on the graph were listed in units other than meters per second, you will need to convert the units to find the speed in meters per second.

For example, speed=48,0001,800=26.67m/s{\displaystyle {\text{speed}}={\frac {48,000}{1,800}}=26.67m/s}.

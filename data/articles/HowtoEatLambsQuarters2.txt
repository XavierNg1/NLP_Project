 After bringing home and washing a haul of lamb’s quarters seeds, spread them out on a baking pan and drizzle them with olive oil. Bake for 10-15 minutes at 350°F (176°C), or until they just begin to brown. Afterwards, they’ll have a delightful crunch and smoky, savory undertones.Season roasted seeds with seasoned salt, garlic powder or dried coriander for a bolder flavor.
Snack on the seeds by themselves, or use them to top salads, oatmeal or yogurt., When stripped of their chaff, lamb’s quarters seeds yield a grain very similar to quinoa. Place the naked grains in a rice cooker or saucepan with a 2:1 ratio of water and cook them until they’re plump and fluffy. The result will be a soft, earthy hot cereal that is just as delicious with butter, honey and cinnamon as it is with onion and a dash of curry powder.Try lamb’s quarters grains as an alternative to ordinary quinoa or couscous.Spice the grain appropriately and swap it out for rice in vegetarian burritos, stir fries or gumbo.
 Funnel a few handfuls of whole seeds (cleaned and rinsed) into a food processor of coffee grinder. Pulse the seeds into a coarse meal, or blend them longer to produce a fine flour. You can then use the flour to bake bread or bind heavy ingredients in other recipes.The flour made from lamb’s quarters seeds is naturally gluten free. This makes it a cheaper option than many of the prepackaged gluten-free flours you’ll find at health food stores.

 This method is for getting old tomato stains out of clothing or fabrics. And you donâ€™t need to get the whole garment wet, just the part with the stain.
 First test out the dishwasher detergent on a part of your clothing which is out of the way to see if it changes the color or texture of the garment. Then gently rub the whole wet stain with dishwasher detergent.
 Continue rubbing the stain with the detergent using your ice cube. Rub until it looks like the stain has come out.
 If the stain still remains, use your sponge and vinegar, and blot the stain to see if it lifts. The acid in the vinegar should help to break down the remaining stain.
 Follow the handling instructions, and wash your fabric normally. Dry the fabric in direct sunlight with the stain side facing up. The UV rays in the sunlight should help break down any of the remaining stain.

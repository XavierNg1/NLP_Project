 Make sure the instrument is not dented and the slides and valves move freely. It may come from a nameless brand, but that's fine for starters. Make sure it's a "B flat major" trumpet, the most common kind and therefore, easiest to learn.;
, Those books normally come with accompaniment CDs, and also include scales, techniques for playing, and many beginner's pieces.
 Instead, close your mouth and press your lips together, crease the corners of your mouth and blow, making a buzzing sound. This is the embouchure, the way you form your mouth and lips.
 Do this every time you practice, as it gets you ready for playing and also improves your tone quality.
 Buzz into the mouthpiece again, but don't press any of the valves yet. Do that for a little while until you have the buzzing technique pretty much mastered.
 Hold the three valve casings with your left hand.
 You'll learn more about these in your method book. The fingerings, in order are:


Low C--No valves (often written as a zero)
D--Valves one and three
E--Valves one and two
F--Valve one
G--No valves
A--Valves one and two
B--Valve two
High C--No valves

,, Eventually, you will improve at playing. Also look in the back for a fingering chart, a glossary and also additional scales (there are twelve in total).
 Ask at a music shop or go online to see if there are any instructors in your area who give lessons.
 Begin with a warm up (buzzing in the mouthpiece, blowing warm air through the instrument, scales)and then work on the things that are hardest for you. Practice short lines of music at a time.

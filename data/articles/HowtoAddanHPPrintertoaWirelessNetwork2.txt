 As there are many makes and models, you will need to consult the manuals of both the printer and router to verify compatibility.
The wireless router must have a physical WPS pushbutton available.
Your network must use WPA or WPA2 security protocols. WPS wireless routers, in general, won't connect with the WPS method if set up using WEP security, or no security at all. Also, WPS routers won't connect using the WPS method if you're using the router's default network name and no security.
 As setting this mode depends on the particular model of printer you are using, consult the manual for details on how to accomplish that.


Once WPS mode is engaged on your printer, press the WPS button on your router. You must do this within two minutes.

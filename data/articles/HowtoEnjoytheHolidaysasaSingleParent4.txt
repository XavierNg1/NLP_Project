 Some custody agreements forbid parents from introducing new partners on holidays or before a set timeline. Make sure your plans are in line with your agreement. If your relationship with your ex is cordial, you may even want to discuss it directly with them., Don’t surprise them at the Thanksgiving table. Make sure they know who your partner is and that they will be spending the holidays together. If they’ve never met them before, it might be a good idea to introduce them before the holiday. Answer any questions or concerns they have well before the holiday starts, so they aren’t nervous or stressed out., Make sure your new partner knows about any important issues before the holiday, and let them know about any expectations you have. For example, you may want your partner to stay in the background for the first holiday so you can take the lead in planning and spending time with your kids., A lavish gift might make them feel guilty or pressured, so ask your partner to get the kids something small the first time they spend the holidays together. You can coordinate your gifts--for example, if you got your child a new video game system, your partner could get them a game for it. If you are on a very tight budget for gifts, you could get your kids a small gift and your partner could get them a friendly card., Don’t make the holiday a copy of the old one when a new partner is involved. Your kids may resent the implied comparison with their other parent. If your children’s father always dressed up as Santa or made special Hanukkah cookies, don’t ask your new partner to do the same. Keep some of your family traditions, but establish some new ones with your new blended family.

 In addition to the tricks you can pull in the air, you can also get a boost on the ground by pulling a wheelie. However, this option is only open to motorcycles â€” four-wheeled karts are not able to do wheelies.
 To perform a wheelie, first, start driving and build up a good amount of speed. When you come to a straight length of road, lift the controller up. The front wheel of your motorcycle should lift off of the ground.When you do a wheelie, you should notice that you immediately begin to go a little faster at your top sped.
If you're using the steering wheel, be sure to keep it level while you lift it to avoid accidentally steering.
 When you want to exit the wheelie and resume normal driving, make a downward motion with your controller. The front wheel of the motorcycle should return to the ground and you should be able to steer normally.
 When you do a wheelie, you'll notice that your steering is affected dramatically. You only have a little control over the direction you go, so even minor turns can be tricky. Because of this, it's best to use wheelies only when you're on a section of track where you don't have to do very much maneuvering. Long, straight stretches are best.


You'll also want to be careful of the other racers around you when pulling a wheelie. If another racer bumps into you while your wheel is in the air, you'll lose control and your speed will plummet., As with aerial tricks, the way that you pull a wheelie with a non-WiiMote controller is a little different than with a WiiMote. Start as you normally would by accelerating until you're near your top speed.
 When you're ready to do a wheelie, press the upper direction on the D-pad (the same cross-shaped pad you used to do tricks in the air.) Your racer should pull a wheelie.
 When you're ready to end your wheelie, press the lower direction on the D-pad. Your racer should drop the motorcycle's front wheel and you should be able to steer like normal once again.

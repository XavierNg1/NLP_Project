 While you can use this style anytime, it can actually work better on hair that's not freshly washed. If you did just wash your hair, it can help to add a little dry shampoo. You can also add hairspray, if that's your preference. These products will help make it easier to style., Make sure you don't have any tangles or knots in your hair. Styling tangled hair can cause severe knots when you take down your hairdo. It's important to brush in the direction of the ponytail. That is, brush as if you are trying to sweep your hair into a ponytail, brushing towards the crown of your head. That means also flipping your head over to brush upwards toward the crown.
 Lift a small section of your hair about midway to the crown. Backcomb towards the roots gently with a teasing comb. This teasing helps round your hair and give it volume at the top.
 Hold the hair in place at the back of your crown with one hand. Smooth out with a brush or comb, but only do so lightly on the top of your head where you teased it.
 Pull the band around your ponytail onto the crown of your head. Twist the band into a figure 8 and pull the new loop back through your hair. Repeat this movement until the hair tie is tight enough that it stays put.








Do not use a rubber band, as that will tangle your hair. Always use a hair tie made for hair. You may need an extra thick one for a high ponytail.To look extra nice, take a small section of hair from the bottom of your ponytail and carefully wrap it around the elastic. Secure it with a bobby pin running along the bottom of the hair tie to completely disguise it., Lightly spray hairspray over the part of your hair that is secure. This will help to keep your hair in place., Spray a dedicated toothbrush with some hairspray. Run the toothbrush along any stray hairs that you missed. This technique will help hold them down without flattening your crown.

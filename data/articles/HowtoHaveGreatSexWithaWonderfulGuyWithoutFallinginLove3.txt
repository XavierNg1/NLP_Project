 Since your relationship is primarily sexual in nature, it’s important to have the best sex you possibly can. One easy way to do this is to be honest about what you’re enjoying and what you can live without.If you have any sexual fantasies, share them with your partner. He may be willing to try things with you that previous partners passed on.
Make sure you reciprocate. Don’t be a selfish lover – give as much as you’re getting.
 Just because your sex friend is not your boyfriend doesn’t mean you shouldn’t make an effort. Brush your teeth, wash your hair, and take a shower before showing up. Make the same effort you would make for any other sexual partner.This courtesy should be extended both ways. If you feel your sex friend isn’t making an effort for you, it may be time to end the relationship.
Don’t feel like you have to dress up the way you would for a first date. You’re not trying to impress your sex friend, you’re just practicing common courtesy.
 Some people feel hesitant to explore certain sexual urges, especially with long-term romantic partners. Your friend with benefits is the perfect person to try new things with, so be open to experimenting.Don’t rely on old favorites - change up your sex position each time you have sex.
Try having sex somewhere other than in the bedroom, on the bed.
Experiment with toys and role playing.
 The best sex is sex free from worry – be open and honest about your sexual health and make sure your partner does the same. Have your partner wear a condom to protect against possible STDs.Continue to use the condom, even if both of you have recently been tested. Your relationship is not exclusive, so it’s important that you protect yourself as much as possible.
Do not do anything you and your partner aren’t comfortable with or haven’t talked about. Make sure everything is consensual and everyone feels safe.

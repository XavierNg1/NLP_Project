 Dark colors make people seem more confident and authoritative, so when you need to look confident wear black, charcoal, navy, or other dark colors. Avoid pastels and other lighter tones when you want to appear confident.;
, Whether you are a student or a professional, wearing clothing that is more formal and professional than what other people wear will make you seem more confident. People will perceive you as more confident if you wear slightly dressier clothing than you need to wear.For example, instead of wearing a collared shirt to school, wear a freshly pressed button down shirt. Or if you are giving a presentation and you would normally wear a casual outfit, wear something dressier like a suit.
 If your clothing is ill fitting, you will likely be fiddling with it all day. Constantly readjusting your clothes will make you seem like you lack confidence and it may actually make you feel less confident. Instead, choose clothing that fits very well so that you wonâ€™t have to constantly readjust your outfit as you go through your day., Maintaining sleek hair, a fresh face, and manicured nails will also contribute to your appearance of self-confidence. If you look well kept, then you will seem more confident to others.

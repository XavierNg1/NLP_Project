 Natural sea sponges can work like disposable tampons. Clean sponges intended for this purpose are sold through various health supply stores. Cut the sponge to size and then insert like a tampon. Rinse the sponge daily. This solution is slightly messier than using a menstrual cup but is an all-natural, reusable product. Like menstrual cups, sea sponges are safe to use while sleeping., These are typically sold as "moon pads" and are especially good for nighttime use. Reusable pads are easily washed, dried, and reworn, eliminating waste on the trail, although you will need to use a zippered plastic bag or other solution to store soiled pads between washes. They also take up space in a pack, so consider your weight and space requirements carefully if you're planning to use reusable pads on a backpacking excursion., This advice applies to both reusable and disposable products, but hygiene becomes especially significant when you are washing and reusing the same equipment multiple times. Washing before you use a product is just as important as cleaning your hands afterward. Doing so keeps bacteria away from this sensitive region of your body. Urinary tract infections and yeast infections are never fun, but they're especially important to avoid when you're out camping and away from medical help.

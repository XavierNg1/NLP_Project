 See if there is any discoloration or damage. If all is well, take the hairspray, and spray directly onto the stain. Hairspray with extra holding powers is ideal because the chemicals will grab onto the makeup effectively.


The faster you treat the makeup stain, the more likely it will be completely removed.
Be careful when using hairspray on delicate fabrics, such as lace or silk. You may not have to apply multiple coats for the hairspray to harden.
 After a few minutes, the hairspray should harden into the stain and the fabric. If this is not happening, spray the area again, and wait another few minutes.
 Get a clean paper towel, and run it under cold water. The colder the water, the better it is to remove the stain. Wring out any excess water, so that you will not completely saturate the fabric. The paper towel should be cool to the touch but not drenched.
 With the dampened paper towel, blot the hairspray out of your clothing. The makeup should be removed along with the hairspray.Push gently down on the stain with your paper towel and lift it off to see how much makeup has been removed, repeat until no makeup is visible on your clothing.
To minimize the chance of leaving paper towel pieces on your clothing, use a heavy duty 2-ply paper towel.

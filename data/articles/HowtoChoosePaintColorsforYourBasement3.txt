 Of course, you likely aren't willing to discard your existing furniture and décor when painting. This means that choosing colors will be constrained by the colors in your existing pieces.Think about the hues of your furniture pieces and what colors would go well with them. Rich paint colors would blend well with yellowy wood tones.
 In addition to your existing furniture, you’ll need to consider what decorative items you’ll be putting in the basement. You don’t want to have to purchase all new items just to match the paint color you choose.If you’re using neutral paint colors like taupe or beige, a great way to add some excitement and color is through your accents. Throw a brightly colored pillow on the couch or include a colorful piece of artwork on the wall.
 Even if you aren’t planning on moving any time soon, you should try to consider what a potential future buyer might think of your renovation plans. You don’t want to make a change you’ll have to undo in order to sell your home later. Rather, you want to make changes that are both appealing to you and increase the value of your home and attract a wide range of buyers.Try not to paint your basement a wild color that could be off-putting to others (like bubblegum pink or lime green).
If you are selling the home soon, try to work within a limited palette. Being adventurous with paint and décor color schemes can often turn potential buyers off.
 While it is important to consider what potential buyers might be interested in, the basement can also be a place where you let your decorating side go a little crazy – especially if you plan on living in this home for a long time. Not every visitor in your home will see your basement, so this gives you an opportunity to really express yourself through color.Let yourself pick vibrant, exciting colors that will make a statement. But be sure to coordinate with your décor so that you don’t have clashing color combinations.

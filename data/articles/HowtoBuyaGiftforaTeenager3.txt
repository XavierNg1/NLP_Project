 If all else fails, a gift card is always a safe choice. Give the teen a gift card to their favorite retailer, for example Urban Outfitters, Best Buy, or Game Stop. If you do not know their favorite retailer, then fill a temporary credit card with money, like Vanilla Visa., Alternatively, you can give them cash. This way, you can ensure that you are giving the teen something they want and like. Buy a card for the occasion from your local store or pharmacy and place the money in the card.
 Gift receipts are important because they allow the gift receiver to choose something they like in the event that they do not like the gift they received. When purchasing the gift, make sure it is returnable, and ask for a gift receipt. Choose a gift from a retailer that has a flexible return policy.


See if the store only allows exchanges with products of equal or lesser value, or will issue the person a gift card or store credit in equal value.

 If hanging a heavy bag from the ceiling worries you, try attaching it to the wall. Most athletic stores sell wall mounts that include all hardware needed to attach it to the wall. This method is only recommended for masonry walls. Otherwise, you might cause damage to your house.


The bracket of a wall mount is screwed into the wall close to the ceiling.
 If hanging a heavy bag from the ceiling or wall is impossible, there are many free stands available. Some even have wheels for added mobility. Free stands must be weighed down to prevent movement during use. Heavier bags usually require around 300 pounds of weight to prevent movement, although lighter bags may be held down with as little as 100 pounds.


If you're using a free-standing rack, simply attach the chain on the heavy bag to the S-hook on the rack. No installation is required.

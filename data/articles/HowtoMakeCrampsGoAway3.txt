 For most women, cramping goes away after a few hours or a day. For others it can be a serious problem that interrupts regular life. If this is the case for you, the cramping may be a signal that a reproductive problem is actually what's causing the pain. See a physician if you experience the following:


Cramping that forces you to stay in bed rather than going to school, work, or completing your regular activities.
Cramping that lasts more than 2 days.
Cramping so painful that it causes you to have a migraine, feel nauseated, or vomit.
 Your physician will probably conduct tests to determine if you have a disorder that is causing your cramping to be abnormally severe. Do some research on the following reproductive disorders:


Endometriosis. This is a common condition in which the uterine lining is partly outside the uterus, which leads to a lot of pain.
Fibroids. These are small tumors that can grow on the uterine wall and cause pain.
Pelvic inflammatory disease. This is a type of infection that can cause severe pain.

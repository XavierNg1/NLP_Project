Ask a friend or relative to help you reach for items and prepare any food so you do not have to stand or walk.;

Doing this can help to reduce any pain or soreness and keep the swelling down.Do not leave the ice pack on for longer than 20 minutes at a time as too much cold can aggravate your knee joints.
 Take a compression band or an elastic bandage and wrap it around your knee. Wrap the compression band around your knee several times, protecting the joints in your knee. Make sure the compression band is snug but not cutting off circulation to your knee. You may need someone to assist you in wrapping your knee, depending on how severe the ACL tear is.

 For the cat repellent, you’ll need a spray bottle. Pour 1 part vinegar and 1 part water into the bottle, and swish them together quickly to blend them.Use white vinegar for the spray.
You can use tap, filtered, purified, or bottled water for the repellent.
You can use either a plastic or glass spray bottle for repellent.
 When the vinegar and water are mixed, squeeze 1 part liquid hand soap into the spray bottle. Shake the mixture vigorously to ensure that the soap is fully combined with the vinegar mixture.Any type of hand soap will work for the repellent, but it’s best to use a clear formula.
 Once the vinegar, water, and soap are fully mixed together, apply on the areas where you want to discourage cats from going. You can spray it directly from the bottle or apply it to a cloth and wipe it over the spots.You can use the repellent to keep cats away from both indoor and outdoor locations.

 Votive candles are a nice choice when you're decorating with flowers, since the flowers accent their delicate shape. Taper candles probably aren't the best choice, since the flowers might stick out too much.
 Go to a craft store and pick out some dried flowers to use as candle decorations. You can find pressed daisies, mums, violets, and other beautiful blossoms that accent the candle you picked out.


If you'd rather not use dried flowers, check out the artificial flower section in your craft store. Choose from an amazing variety of silk and plastic flowers. The upside of these is that they'll never fall apart.
You can also make flowers out of fabric or paper to glue to your candle.
 You could put the flowers in random spots all over the candle, make uniform rows or stripes, or place them in an even polka-dot pattern. Consider these other great options:


Make a flower garden. Glue flowers along the bottom of the candle to resemble a growing garden.
Make vertical flower vines. Glue flowers in vertical rows that have vine-like twists and turns.
Make a flower rim. Glue flowers along the rim of the candle and leave the sides bare.
 Heat up the glue gun or prepare to use your fabric glue. Choose a spot on the candle for the first flower, and put a dot of glue there. Press the flower firmly to the spot and hold it in place for thirty seconds.


If the flower falls away, it might be a little too heavy. Choose a flower that is flatter and lighter.
Try holding the flower in place for a full minute if it isn't sticking.
 Place another dot of glue on another part of the candle. Stick a flower to the spot and hold it in place. Continue gluing flowers to the candle until you're satisfied with the way it looks, then wait for the glue to dry. Your candle is now ready to give away or use to decorate your home.

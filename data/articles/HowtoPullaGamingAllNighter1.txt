 Unless you can already stay up all night, one of these drinks is recommended for staying awake.;
, Having more than one game will ensure that you do not get bored, but it's not compulsory.
 Find a comfortable chair and desk, or even use your sofa. As a precaution, do not use a bed or anything too comfortable, as you may fall asleep.
 Talking to people can help keep you awake, improve your mood, and make gamingÂ more fun.

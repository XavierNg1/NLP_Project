 You'll never be good at English unless you read things. For most of you, this is a seriously big yawn, but when I say "read", I don't mean boring things like non-fiction texts. Fictions, magazines, catalogues, online articles, newspapers, as long as you can read it, great.;
, No way will anyone get anywhere unless they listen to what's being said during a lesson. It doesn't brand you as a geek because you pay attention.
 If you enjoy what you're learning, write things at home. Begin trying to use brackets (like that ), or colons; they can help with your level.
 You know when things are too easy for you, so make a point of saying so ( but not bragging ), and challenging yourself to something harder. You'll learn more this way.
 Believe it or not, reading aloud makes you more fluent, and understand words better.
 Asking questions about what you're reading develops your knowledge even further, giving you better vocabulary.
 After school clubs, local clubs, library reads, they're a brilliant way to get you reading for fun, or in a competition.
 Every time you read, something brilliant happens to your knowledge and understanding of English. You learn more words, you get new ideas etc.
 Reading shouldn't be a boring task; there's always the right book for you somewhere. Keep reading, and keep having fun!

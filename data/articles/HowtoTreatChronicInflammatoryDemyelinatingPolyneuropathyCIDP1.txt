 Physical/occupational therapy is a highly personalized and highly effective form of a treatment and recovery for CIDP. In order for it to work for you, it is essential to have a long-term plan with a dedicated therapist (or therapists).This plan should include:


Treating acute symptoms.
Moving through recovery (step-by-step).
Physical therapy practice for home.;
, While you are still experiencing the “acute stage” of the disease (meaning that symptoms are still worsening), you may have very little mobility. You may not be able to tolerate much active movement. Physical therapy can still play a role.During this phase, physical/occupational therapists can:


Help you to sit, stand, and move in ways that will cause the least amount of pain.
Perform gentle, passive range-of-motion exercises on you to minimize atrophy.
Introduce breathing exercises that can help with the pain.
 As a you begin to recover motor control and sensation, physical therapy can become less passive, and more active (or active-assisted). In this phase, physical/occupational therapists can help you to slowly strengthen your muscles and stretch your tendons. Through the help of physical therapy, may patients make full recoveries.During this phase, physical/occupational therapists can:


Expand your activities gradually.
Increase repetitions before increasing intensity.
Teach you energy conservation techniques.

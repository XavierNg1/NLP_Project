 You will need to use/purchase a small glass vial (a vial of Ginseng extract available at vitamin stores is the right size), a small straw or tube, a sharp knife, and tape.
 Remove anything inside the vial and thoroughly wash it so that it is completely clean. Do the same with the plastic lid that the vial came with.
 Use your knife to cut a small round hole large enough for your straw or tube to fit through. Try to avoid rough edges by using smooth cuts.
 The hole should be big enough that the straw will easily fit into the lid. Cut a small hole in the base of the straw near the top of the lid to allow for airflow.
 Replace the lid on the vial and make sure that all the parts fit together. Once you are sure it all fits, you can remove the cap to add your preferred substance to the inside of the vial. Make sure the straw only goes about halfway down, so that it doesnâ€™t melt with the heat or suck-up any particles.

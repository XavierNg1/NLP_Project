 Some cats get around just fine on their front legs, but a mobility assistance device can also do wonders. These devices provide a way to lift their back end and increase mobility through wheels, allowing the cat to be mobile., While many cats will take to assistance devices, some cats don't. In addition, your cat cannot stay in an assistance device all day. For these purposes, your cat should have a drag bag.

 When a cat becomes disabled, you need to make changes around your home so it can get around more easily.

For instance, if your cat is in a wheelchair device, make sure the cat has enough room to get around.

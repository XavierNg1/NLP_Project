 Many large-breed dogs, such as German Shepherds, are especially prone to musculoskeletal disorders such as hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia. These conditions can lead to pain, arthritis, and potentially lameness. Medication can help postpone arthritis, but should only be provided with the consent of your veterinarian.In serious cases, surgery is often necessary to repair the musculoskeletal issues that large dog breeds are likely to develop.
 Small dogs, such as Shih Tzus, Yorkshire Terriers, and Dachshunds, may be at greater risk of specific musculoskeletal problems, such as inter-vertebral disc disease, hip dysplasia, and patellar luxation. Note that these dogs’ risk for injury from jumping, climbing stairs, or vigorous exercise is greater than in other breeds.Patellar luxation, or “wobbly kneecaps,” may cause the dog to hobble, skip, or limp. If these symptoms develop, or if your dog seems be experiencing a loss of coordination or a loss of sensation, take your dog to the veterinarian.
Note that roughly ¼ of Dachshunds suffer from inter-vertebral disk disease or other musculoskeletal problems.
Shih Tzus are also prone to eye problems and the airway obstructions common in short or flat-nosed breeds. Dachshunds and Yorkshire Terriers are also especially likely to suffer from eye conditions.
 Labrador Retrievers are not only one of the most popular breeds of dogs, they are also among the healthiest. However, they are liable to become obese if they do not got enough exercise, and/or are overfed. In turn, obesity will greatly complicate your Lab’s health, increasing the risk of musculoskeletal issues, joint issues, and diabetes.Make sure that your dog gets at least ten to twenty minutes of moderate exercise twice a day.
Follow your veterinarian’s specific instructions regarding feeding. Be sure to notify them if your dog gains weight rapidly.
Rottweilers are also prone to obesity, as well as potential joint issues.

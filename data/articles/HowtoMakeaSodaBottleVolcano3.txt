 For this volcano, you will need 400 milliliters (13.5  fl oz) of vinegar, 200 mL of water, a squirt of dishwashing liquid, a large spoonful of baking soda, an empty 2-liter soda bottle, and red food coloring.Do a little experimentation to find the proper amounts of each material to get the size of eruption you want.
You can use a smaller plastic bottle, but will have to adjust the ingredients accordingly.
 Use red-wine vinegar for the best lava coloring. Alternatively, you can also add red or orange food coloring to white vinegar. The liquid soap breaks the surface tension of water, therefore creating a larger eruption.
 This method won’t make as big a mess as the Mentos method, but you definitely don’t want to have to scrub the results out of a carpet or rug.


If the weather is agreeable, place the volcano outside.
 The baking soda will react with the vinegar mixture and cause your volcano to erupt! If you want a larger explosion increase the amount of vinegar and baking soda used.

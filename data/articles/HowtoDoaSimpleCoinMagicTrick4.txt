 In private, put a piece of double-sided tape on one corner of your cloth. Make sure the penny will stick onto it.









For the cloth, you can use a piece of paper, a rag, or a paper towel. It doesn't have to be a penny, but the penny is a good, average size.
The smaller the piece of tape, the better (it'll be less obvious should you not be skilled in sleight of hand) – however, you risk the penny not sticking to it when the trick is in full gear.
 Keep the double-sided tape bit concealed and facing you. For all your audience knows, it's just a regular paper towel (or whatever it is you're using).









Be careful putting your finger over the tape – you don't want to remove the adhesive from the tape with the oils from your fingers before the trick even begins.
 Show it to your audience. It's just a regular penny inside a paper towel, right? Right. Well, if you make sure your hand is blocking the piece of tape from view.









The flimsier the cloth, the better. This way when you show the center of the cloth with the penny, the sides naturally fall down, away from view.
 One by one, fold them all in. In this little pocket you've created, you're going to make the coin disappear. But first, ask a person in the audience to feel the coin is still there. It will be, arousing no suspicion.









Keep the corners folded in as the person touches it. However, encourage them to touch it on both sides. As long as they don't move the cloth, your trick should go off without a hitch.
 And then presto! Show the empty cloth, towel, or paper to your audience. Wiggle it around, holding it by the same taped corner. Where did it go?









Remember: if someone asks you how you did it, just say, "A magician never reveals his secrets!"

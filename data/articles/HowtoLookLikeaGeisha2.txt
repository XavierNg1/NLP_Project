 Geishas cover up their eyebrows, and then redraw them. Since you have already covered your eyebrows, itâ€™s time to draw them in. Using a steady hand, draw in the eyebrows with a black or dark brown eyebrow pencil.Make sure that the eyebrows you draw in are not too thick, and that they have a gentle arch as opposed to being straight across.
Some geishas incorporate a little red into the beginnings of their eyebrows. Do what you wish according to your preferences.
 Many geishas use red makeup for the outer corners of their eyes. Geisha apprentices, called maiko, usually use the most amount of red, and as they go through training they wear less and less. You have some liberty about what amount of red eye shadow you want to use.Some geishas draw red eye makeup in a small dot at the corner of their eye, while others draw diamond shapes, or simply layer a light layer of red without forming a specific shape.
 Use a gel liner or liquid eyeliner and apply a line of black against your top lash line. A gel or liquid eyeliner will give you the crisp, precise look that you want for your top lash line. If you wish, you can also apply eyeliner to the bottom lash line using a pencil. , Use a red lip liner to create a lower and upper lip line about a centimeter in from your actual lip line. For the upper lip, draw the line slightly lower than your actual lip line. For the lower lip, draw the line a little higher than your natural line.In traditional Japanese culture, a small, pouty mouth is considered beautiful. This is why geishas draw their mouths smaller than they actually are.
 Use a red lipstick to fill in the lips that you outlined with pencil. Traditional geisha lipstick is made from beni, extract from Japanese safflower. This extract is mixed with water and applied using a brush. However, you can use any bright-red lipstick that has a lustrous finish.

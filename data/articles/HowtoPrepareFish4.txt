 This method is ideal for flat fish, such as flounder and sole.If you are working with a round-bodied fish, such as tuna or salmon, click here.
 Locate the head, and use your knife to make a shallow cut around it, just behind the gills. Cut the head from the body with a pair of scissors. Use the shallow cuts you made as a guideline.
 Some fish might even have a stripe going down the center of their body. Use this stripe as a guideline. Keep going over the slit until you reach the bones. When you reach the tail, cut a horizontal slit right across the tail, but do not cut the tail off.


Try to get a flexible filleting knife for this.
 Gently score a line into the flesh to one side of the spine; keep the blade pointed towards the ribs. Once you can peel part of the flesh away, slide the knife down into the fish and begin cutting the fillet away from the ribs. Work your way from the head towards the tail. Try to keep the knife between the flesh and the ribs at all times. Pull the fillet away and set it aside.
 Rotate the fish, and make another cut down the center, to the other side of the spine. Saw the flesh away from the bones.
 When you are done, flip the fish over so that you can see its belly. Cut two more fillets, to either side of its spine. You will end up with four fillets.
 Turn the fillet so the thinnest side is facing you. Position the knife so that it is almost parallel to the cutting board, but at a slight downward angle. Carefully saw the flesh away from the skin.
 The fins should be left behind when you skin the fish, but if any remain on the fillet, you should cut them off. At this point, you can also discard the rest of the fish's body as well, including the head and spine.
 Gently massage the meat with your fingers to get rid of any excess blood and guts.

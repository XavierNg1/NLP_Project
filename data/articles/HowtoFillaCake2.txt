 Choose a jam that complements the flavor of the cake. Simply spread enough of the jam across the base half of the cake from the edges to the middle, or in a circular fashion.;
, For jam that is chunkier, warming it will help it spread more easily. This is especially good for a jam like apricot jam. Add the amount needed to a small saucepan. Gently heat for a few minutes, stirring to help break down the jam a little. Then remove from the heat and spread across the base half of the cake until covered.
 Frost or ice the cake if you're doing so.

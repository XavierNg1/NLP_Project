 To make some luxurious shea butter body melts, you will need equal parts of shea, grated beeswax, and food-grade oil (such as olive oil or coconut oil). You will also need something to use as molds, such as a silicone ice cube tray or candy molds.


If you want fragranced body melts, you can add a few drops of essential oil, such as rose, lavender, or vanilla.
 If you do not have one, you can make your own by filling a large pot with 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 centimeters) of water, and placing a large bowl on top. The bowl should fit snugly and not touch the water.
 Set the heat on your stove to "medium" and wait for the water to begin steaming.
 Be sure to stir if often so that it melts evenly and does not scorch.
 Keep stirring until everything is melted and spread evenly throughout.
 Work quickly so that the mixture does not harden while you are pouring it.
 You can use them by massaging them over your skin. The wax and shea butter will melt, leaving a thin film on your skin. The film will get absorbed into your skin, leaving it feeling soft and smooth.

 You want your smoked beef ribs to be tender, and the fell is tough and sinewy.

Slide a knife beneath the fell so you can peel it off.
Grab the loose piece of fell with a paper towel.
Pull the fell off.
 You may rub the ribs with dry seasonings or marinade them in your favorite sauce.

Make a dry rub out of sugar, salt, spices and/or herbs.
Soak your ribs in a marinade. When smoking meats, an acidic marinade will act as a tenderizer. Acidic sauces include citrus fruit or vinegar.
Let the ribs set overnight so that they will soak up the seasoning.

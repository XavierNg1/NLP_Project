 In this method, you’ll need only a cardboard toilet paper roll (with the toilet paper gone) and some water. To begin, fill a relatively large bowl with water. Be sure the temperature of the water is comfortable enough to put your hands in. You could also fill a sink for quick drainage later.
 On your toilet paper roll, you should see that it is formed by a spiral glued to itself. Generally the ends of the spiral will be pointed tips at either end of the toilet paper roll. The cardboard should be soft enough that you can rip it yourself, undoing the glue and unfurling the paper roll into a cardboard sheet.If the cardboard doesn’t seem to want to budge, don’t hesitate to get scissors and simply cut the roll lengthwise in half.
 Take the now open cardboard roll and push it to the bottom of the bowl of water. You’ll most likely need to hold it at the bottom with your hand. Allow a minute or so for the cardboard roll to fill with water. Once soaked, it will be pliable and capable of molding into your fake poop.


Don’t fret if the cardboard ends up ripping. Once you begin the mold, you can simply stick the fallen pieces back on. The only concern is pieces falling off once the mold dries.
 Remove the cardboard from the water. You may need to hold it above the bowl for a few seconds to allow the excess water to fall off. The cardboard is best molded by laying it flat in your hand and squeezing into a closed fist. This will compress the cardboard into your fake poop.Like the previous method, this fake poop is also used best shortly after its creation. Otherwise, the cardboard may dry out and begin to crack and fall apart.
You may be able to make your fake poop last longer by sprinkling a bit of water over it as it begins to dry.

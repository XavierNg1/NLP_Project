 Playing a beat with just one pencil is a bit more complicated that using your hands in combination with a pencil. You should hold the pencil in a way that you can utilize both ends of the pencil quickly.


Hold the pencil with you index finger and thumb directly in the middle of the pencil. Feel the weight and make adjustments to your hold until the pencil feels balanced., You can imitate bass tones from a drum kit by using the eraser side of a pencil. The eraser side of the pencil produces a muted tone similar to a tom or a bass drum. Increase the bass tones of the pencil by playing on a hollow surface like an empty bottle.
 The point side of a pencil is better to be used for the higher pitched tones on the drum kit. Sharpen your pencil to increase the amount of treble in the sound. You can increase the treble sound by playing on a hard surface like a desk something metal.


The tip will probably break off if you make hard hits for the beat.
 Practice alternating sides of the pencil from the balanced position between your index finger and thumb. Try to make a simple beat by counting 1-2-3-4. Play the treble side for 1-2-3 and then play the bass on the 4. Start slowly and work your way towards a unified beat.


Play along to your favorite songs to get a better feeling for holding the pencil this way.
You could also play along to a metronome to help your timing.

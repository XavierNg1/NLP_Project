 The term "Alternative Spring Break" (ASB for short) refers to new types of volunteer opportunities that allow students to spend their Spring Break traveling to places where they can be of service to others. Rather than lounging on the beach, you'll be out staffing shelters, working with at-risk youth or contributing to the upkeep of public grounds. Look into the kind of work performed by different groups and find one that you think you'd like to be a part of.A few organizations who offer comprehensive ASB opportunities include The United Way, Projects Abroad and various state-sponsored universities. You can contact these groups directly, or look to see what opportunities are available through your school.
ASB programs are the perfect option for industrious students who are eager to make a difference, but only have a limited time to do it.;
, Once you've found a cause that resonates with you, your next step is to submit a formal application. You'll be asked to supply a few basic personal details, along with general information about your school and past volunteer involvement. There may also be some attendant fees to cover things like lodging, meals and other necessities for duration of the week.You have the option of signing up as an individual, as part of a larger group or even with an entire school club or department.The overall cost of ASB programs tends to average between $300-$700 per participant.
 During your time in an ASB program, you'll have a full week to tackle various tasks that will ultimately strengthen the community you've chosen to devote your time to. In addition, your ASB experience will enable you to develop valuable leadership skills, cooperate with a team of like-minded peers and establish meaningful connections that will enrich your life and the lives of those around you.Hands-on volunteer service projects are a great way to be of real use while also strengthening your professional qualifications.

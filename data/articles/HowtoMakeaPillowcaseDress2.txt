 Use fabric scissors to start turning your potato sack/nun's habit into something much more fashionable.









Be diligent, but don't stress if your cut isn't perfect. You'll be hemming it anyway.
If your pillowcase needs to be shorter, cut the length to your needs.
 Do this on what was the closed end just a second ago.









Fold your pillowcase in half prior to sewing to cut mirrored openings.
Use another dress for reference or feel free to eyeball it, if you're confident!

, This dress is sleeveless, so don't hem the front and back together!









Use bias binding (if you have it) to give your dress a "bordered" feel.
 Use an iron to flatten the fabric prior to sewing to ensure a symmetrical casing for your ribbon.









Pin the casing in the front and back for extra guidance. In addition, it's a good idea to reverse at the edges as this is a stress point for the dress.
 It needs to be of a sufficient length to pull through the dress and tie easily at the shoulders.









Double the length of what it takes to cross the width of the dress, including the area of the shoulders, to make sure you have enough for a sturdy bow. Do this twice for ribbons of equal length.
Use a safety pin to guide your ribbon through the channel.
 Gather the dress depending on the size of the wearer.









When you decide on your ribbon length, it's a good idea to do a fixed bow so it doesn't unravel while wearing.
 It should wrap around the natural waistline--the smallest point of the torso.









For a young girl, this often isn't necessary. If given as a gift, however, include the sash just in case.

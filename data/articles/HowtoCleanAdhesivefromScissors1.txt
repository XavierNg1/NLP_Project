 Natural citrus oils are powerful degreasersâ€”they can safely and effectively remove adhesives from mirrors, picture frames, and scissor blades. You may purchase a citrus-based adhesive remover, or make your own at home.


Combine equal parts baking soda and coconut oil in a small, clean jar. Do not melt the coconut oil.
Add a few drops of natural citrus oil to the mixture and stir.;
, Cover your work surface with paper. Squirt your store bought spray onto the scissors or coat the blades with your homemade cleaner. Allow the product to sit on the blades for ten minutes.


Apply the product to each side of the scissor blades.
The paper will protect your work surface from the cleaning products., With a clean cotton ball, carefully wipe down the blades. Run the cotton ball over both sides of the blades until all of the cleaner and adhesive is gone.


Wipe the blades from the base of the handles to the tips of the blades.
If the sides of your blades are coated in adhesive, wrap the cotton ball around the blade and carefully wipe up and down.

 Suggest the possible cause of your illness casually. You could say, “I think I’ve got this stomach bug that’s going around” or “I don’t think my breakfast agreed with me today.” , Make it clear that it’s urgent, but be very respectful. It’s a good idea to go in the middle of class instead of during a bell change. That way there will be fewer people in the bathroom, and there won’t be any need to fake throwing up for.
 Tell them you think it would be a good idea to go to the nurse. Make it clear that it’s in their best interest to send you to the nurse, because you might throw up in class if you don’t go.There’s no need to be especially graphic. Don’t say, “I’m going to hurl all over my books if I don’t leave now.” Say, “I was sick in the bathroom just now, and I’m afraid that I’ll be sick again soon.”

, Be sure to tell her that you’ve already been sick in the bathroom once. Try to look as pathetic as possible. You may want to to suggest to her that you have a stomach virus or mention some food that didn’t agree with you. Be sure to stick to a consistent story. If you told your friends you think you have a virus, don’t change to food poison when you see the nurse.
 If you have a stomach virus, odds are you also have some other aches and pains. Be careful not to describe any symptoms that the nurse could easily disprove. You might say you have pain in your muscles and joints.
You could claim that you’ve been very tired and lethargic all day.
You might also say you have a headache.

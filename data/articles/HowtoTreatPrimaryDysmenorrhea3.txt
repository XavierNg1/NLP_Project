 It is worth receiving a transvaginal ultrasound to examine your uterus and the surrounding structures for any other pathologies (problems) that may be responsible for causing the pain.
 If your pain is unable to be resolved via a combination of medical and lifestyle methods, it is possible that there is something else going on that may account for your pain. Other conditions to be aware of and to rule out include:


Uterine fibroids - noncancerous growths in the uterus that may lead to increased bleeding and menstrual cramps.
Adenomyosis - when uterine (endometrial) tissue begins to invade areas of the uterus where it is not normally present, leading to an enlarged uterus and increased monthly pain.
Endometriosis - when uterine (endometrial) tissue is present outside of the uterus, somewhere else in the abdominal cavity. This tissue then becomes inflamed every month during menstruation, leading to pain.
 This is when small incisions are made in your abdomen, and a camera is inserted to look around inside your abdomen and pelvic region. There are certain pathologies (problems), such as endometriosis, that can sometimes only be detected via laparoscopic surgery, and that may be responsible for the severe monthly pain that you are experiencing.


If a condition such as endometriosis is diagnosed during laparoscopic surgery, it can be treated during the same surgery.
Treatment consists of the doctors getting rid of ("cauterizing") unnecessary uterine tissue present in the abdominal cavity.
If a condition such as endometriosis is able to be successfully diagnosed and treated during laparoscopic surgery, it will likely play a big role in decreasing your monthly menstrual pain.

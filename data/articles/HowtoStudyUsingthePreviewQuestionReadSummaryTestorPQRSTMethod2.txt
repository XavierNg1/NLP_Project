 Formulate questions that you would like to be able to answer once you have finished studying. Start by using subject headings or subheadings to formulate questions. For instance, turn the heading, “Einstein’s Theory of Relativity” into the question, “What is Einstein’s Theory of Relativity?”, Write down any questions you may have after your initial preview of the material to be studied. Include as few or as many questions as you have based of your understanding of the content. If the text that you are studying includes study questions, add them to the list.For instance, your preview of an astronomy article might lead you to ask questions like, "how long does Mars' orbit take?"

, Use the limited knowledge (or pre-conceived notions) that you already have about a topic to write questions. The questions should be geared towards clarifying the truth about the subject (e.g. "Is it true that bears hibernate for half of the year?"). As you study, these questions will be answered, and misconceptions debunked.

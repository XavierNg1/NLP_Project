 Many states now use the Common Core State Standards, which you can find online.Knowing the math standards your children are learning ahead of time can help you avoid situations in which you can’t help them with their homework.


You can also use the standards to plan home-based learning experiences that extend the learning your child is doing in school., Make sure you are checking in with your children each day and reviewing homework together. This shows that you value math and expect your children to take it seriously. Checking their work also allows you to ensure they are showing all their work and understanding the concepts.Keeping track of what your children are learning can also help foster discussions with their teachers. If you identify areas your students are struggling in, contact their teachers to find out how you can help supplement school work.
 Have your children “tutor” you in certain math topics. Give them a problem, and then encourage them to research how to solve it by using their textbooks, teachers, or online tools. Then ask your children to tutor you in how to solve the problem. Students who teach others often better understand the concepts and perform better on tests.Find out your school’s math scope and sequence, and give your children problems using skills that are upcoming in the curriculum. This way they will be experts on the topics before they see them in the classroom, boosting their math confidence.
If your children needs motivation, offer to pay them some reward for their tutoring services.For example, you could pay them a monetary allowance for their help, or let them earn computer or TV time. Whatever the compensation, make sure you agree on it with your children in advance.

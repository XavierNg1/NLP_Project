 As of May 16th, 2017, the only Pokémon available in Pokémon GO those from the 1st and 2nd generation- the original Pokémon from Red, Blue, Green, gold and silver. This means that while Flareon, Vaporeon, Jolteon, Umbreon and Espeon are available, those from later generations (Sylveon, Leafeon and Glaceon) are not available yet. Stay tuned for the release of these Pokémon!;
, Eevee is a relatively common Normal-type Pokémon, so it can be found quite easily in suburbs or town centers. You are less likely to find Eevee in areas that contain lots of Bug or Water Pokémon, such as forests or near water.When you find Eevee, whip out that PokéBall and catch it.
 In Pokémon GO, Eevee's role serves as an homage to the Eevee Brothers from the original Pokémon anime. The names of the Eevee Brothers were Sparky, Rainer, and Pyro, and they owned a Jolteon, Vaporeon, and Flareon, respectively. Also, if you want, name the Eevee Tamao for an Umbreon, and name the Eevee Sakura for an Espeon. So, name your Eevee as follows depending on how you would like it to evolve:Tap into your Pokémon and select the Eevee you want to evolve. To the right of the name there is a light gray pencil icon. Press that icon, type the name you want, and hit OK.
Sparky - Eevee will evolve into Jolteon
Rainer - Eevee will evolve into Vaporeon
Pyro - Eevee will evolve into Flareon
Tamao - Eevee will evolve into an Umbreon
Sakura - Eevee will evolve into an Espeon

, Go to your Pokémon. Select the Eevee you want to evolve and hit the "Evolve" button. Once you do, it will evolve depending on the name you gave it upon catching it!


All Pokémon all have their own candy and will only respond to that candy. You can see how much candy you have when you tap into that Pokémon's profile.
There are 3 ways you can get candy: by catching that Pokémon, by trading excess of the same Pokémon to Professor Willow, and by hatching eggs.

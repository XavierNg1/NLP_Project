 Test out everything as you read, and make sure everything is working correctly. One of the worst things that could happen is that one of your camcorder's features doesn't work.;
, Take a quick video of something around you (5-15 seconds). Whether it's the trees outside or your family, make sure it's something not too important because if it doesn't turn out the way you want, you'll be disappointed.
 The lighting? Or maybe it's the angle or how you hold the camcorder. Make sure to take note of what you can do to fix it. If it's the lighting, you could turn on the flash feature, if you have it. Or if it's how you hold the camcorder, hold it a different way.
 When you preview it again, see if the mistakes you made in the first video were changed or became better.
 You can delete some that you don't like or put some that you DO like on your computer or watch it on your T.V.
 Don't experiment too much though, otherwise you might end up ruining or damaging your camcorder.

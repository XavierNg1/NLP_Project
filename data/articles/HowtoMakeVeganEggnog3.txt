 Splash a shot of bourbon, rum, or whiskey in the eggnog when you blend it. Add as much or as little as you want.
 If you choose to do this, simply add the rest of your ingredient to the mixture without straining it.


Alternately, you could strain the pulp out, then add a portion of it back to the mixture after straining it out. For instance, if you want your nog just a bit thicker, you could scoop a table spoon or two of the strained nuts when blending the mix for the final time.
 This will reduce the thickness of the nog.


You could also add ice to your cup before pouring yourself a glass. As the ice melts, it will add water to the beverage, making it thinner.
 Cashew and almond milk are readily available in grocery stores. If youâ€™re impatient or just too busy to make your own milk alternative, you could buy one at your local grocery store. You could also use soy milk, though the higher fat content in cashew milk and almond milk make them more appropriate for eggnog.


You could also save time by using vanilla extract instead of vanilla bean.One teaspoon per two to three cups of water should be enough.
 These adjustments can change the flavor profile of your tasty nog.


Pecans are sweeter than walnuts, and have a more mild taste.
Walnuts have a rich flavor and blend well.
 Toss half a frozen banana into the mix before blending everything to give the nog a fruity flavor. You could also play with the spice content of the nog by adding or removing nutmeg, cinnamon, or pumpkin spice.Alternately (or additionally), you could add a tablespoon or two of maple syrup to the blend.

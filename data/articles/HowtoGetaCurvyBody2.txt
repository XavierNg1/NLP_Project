 Pilates is focused on reducing inches and building deep muscles that will shrink your waist. Pull your ab muscles in and up and hard as you can while you lift your chest to the bottom of your shoulder blades during each of these exercises.



Breathe in and out for five seconds each until the 90 seconds is up.
 Hug your right leg into your chest while your left leg goes straight out to a 45-degree angle.


Pull your knee in twice and then switch legs.
Repeat for 60 seconds.
 Then, reach your legs out straight to a 45-degree angle and your arms back to a 45-degree angle.


Hold for two seconds, and then fold into the starting position.
Repeat eight times.
Your torso should not move during the entire exercise. Only the arms and legs will move in towards your body and away from it.
 Bring one leg in and pull it in gently twice.


Switch your legs and grasp your opposite leg. Keep your legs straight the entire time.
Repeat eight times on each side.
 Straighten your legs so that they are sticking straight up.


Lower them to a 45-degree angle, and then raise them up again.
Repeat eight to 12 times.
If your lower back starts to lift, lower the legs less than a 45-degree angle.
Place your hands below your hips when you do this exercise if you have lower back problems.
 This time, place your hands behind your head with your elbow out.


Twist your left armpit toward your right leg as it bends in toward your chest.
Switch legs as you reach your right armpit in toward your left knee.
Repeat eight times on each side.
Lower your legs and arms down and reach them as long as you can on your mat to stretch out your abdominal muscles.

 If you are in a terrible hurry, consider taking only what you need.


When determining what you need, consider the following:
Is this item worth moving, or can I replace this item more cost effectively in the new home?
If money is not a problem and the item has no sentimental value, leave it behind and buy a new one for the new residence.
Make sure what you take actually works.  Has that appliance been sitting in storage for awhile?  Plug it in to make sure it is working before you move it.
Make a list of what you truly need and take only that. (This is not planning, as planning implies weeks of preparation.) :)
Include in your list of things to take, e.g., all of your important records and photos.

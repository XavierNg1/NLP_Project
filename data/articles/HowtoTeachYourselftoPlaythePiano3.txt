 This is the most costly, but also the most proficient way how to learn music. A good instructor will not only have a proven track record of helping beginners learn music, but also be able to teach you the basics correctly. Using an instructor helps you avoid bad habits that can take a long time to unlearn.


Review sight reading, fingering, and playing with an instructor.
Ask the instructor to review where the notes are located on the staff and the piano.
 Because your goal is to teach yourself how to play, then you probably won’t be visiting an instructor frequently. Go to an instructor once a month just to do a check-up on your progress or to ask questions about anything that is puzzling you. For instance, you might have questions about if you’re playing a song in the correct tempo.
 Once again, you will need to practice a great deal in order to learn how to play. Many people that visit piano teachers practice several times a week. So, practice two to three times a week or everyday if you like. Plan on practicing playing for at least 30 minutes two times a week, but you also will need to take time out to review your notes and sight reading abilities. You don’t need a keyboard or a piano to practice those..

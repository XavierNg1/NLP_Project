 A standard sized spray bottle (16 fluid ounces) works fine. Ensure the water and the bottle are clean. Do not use bottles that had bleach or other chemicals in them.;
, You can aim the bottle at one or both cats. If your cat is familiar with the spray bottle and what it does, the very sight of it is likely to send it running and end the conflict.
 Spray two to three times rapidly from a safe distance away. The cats will likely saunter off to groom themselves. If your cats continue fighting, squirt another two to three times. Continue as many times as necessary to end the fighting.


Do not get too close or attempt to manually separate two fighting cats. You will get scratched or bitten., If you’re outside and the weather is warm, you could turn the garden hose on your cats. If your hose has a nozzle and handle on it, use it in the same way you would the water bottle inside. Aim the nozzle at the cats from a distance of three or four meters, squeeze the handle a few times, and enjoy the peace and quiet again. Collect your cat and bring it inside.


If your hose doesn’t have a spray nozzle on it, place your thumb partially over the hole where the water comes out. This builds up a bit of pressure behind the hole and will cause the water that does come out to travel a greater distance. Use this technique to spray water on the fighting cats just as you would if you had a spray handle on your hose.
 Fill the squirt gun with water, aim it at the fighting cats, and fire a three to four second stream at the cats. If they do not stop fighting, spray another three to four second burst. Continue until the conflict ends.


Do not use water to break up a cat fight outside during winter. Cats can easily develop hypothermia and die.
You could substitute a small, less powerful squirt gun for a spray bottle, as well.

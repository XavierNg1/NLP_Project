 This can be done with brief exercise or massage to the area and is very important. Stretching cold muscles can cause cramps and increase the chances of injury.;
, Your partner will be taking you into the stretches and resisting your strength, so they need to be in a solid stance.
 Keep the limb completely relaxed. This helps warm up the joints and shows your partner how far the limb can move prior to applying the stretch.
 Hold the stretch for 30 seconds.
 Your partner should support you so that nothing moves and no other muscles are contracting but those being stretched. For example, if you're stretching the hamstrings of one leg, your partner should have your calf on his/her shoulder. Your knee should not bend, your back should not lift up or turn, and your opposite leg should not move.
 This allows the muscles to relax and recover for the next repetition.
 There should be a noticeable increase in range of motion with each repetition.

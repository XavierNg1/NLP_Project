 While no one likes to appear too eager to talk to someone they like, there is a fine line between interested and disinterested. Contact the person when you feel like contacting them.You do not have to wait for the other person to make the first move in establishing contact.Maintaining balance between exchanges is important but who acts as the initiator is not. Ladies, if you want to call a guy that gave him your number, you don’t have to wait for him to call you first.
While gaps between conversations are perfectly fine, don’t allow more than a couple of days to pass without some form of contact happening.
 This will provide you with ammunition to flirt with him or her. But you should keep in mind that when you give a topic it mustn't be boring. Give a topic that both of you will enjoy and keep your attention.


Some light-hearted, fun questions to include on your topic list are: “Beer, wine, or liquor?”, “Favorite way to relax?”, “Superpowers you wished you had?”, and “What’s the weirdest thing about you?”Prepare yourself mentally to answer any questions that you ask. Conversations typically progress that way naturally., If you are going to talk on the phone with someone, don't watch TV, read a book, or hold another conversation in real life. It’s important that your attention is solely on the other person and that he or she can feel that while speaking to you.Find a quiet location to speak to him or her, avoiding heavily populated locations like a bus, shopping center, or a movie. You want the person to be able to hear you clearly and allow your tone to feel calm and collected as you flirt with your love interest.
Choose a time of day where you know the both of you will not be busy and be less prone to distraction. A good way to do this is to ask him or her ahead of time when an ideal time to call would be.

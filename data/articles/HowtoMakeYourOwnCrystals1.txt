 Add about a half cup(120mL) of Epsom salt (magnesium sulfide) with equal parts hot water.This will create a saturated solution. A solution is considered saturated when no more solids can be dissolved into the liquid.
Add a few drops of food coloring to the mixture if you want your crystals to have some color.;
, Use a spoon to stir the mixture until the salt is dissolved. It should only take about a minute. If some of the salt crystals are left in the bottom it is still going to work so don't worry about it.
 Cooling the mixture rapidly will help the crystals to form more quickly. Water can dissolve more salt when the temperature of the water is higher.Since there is less room for the salt when the water cools, the salt will revert back to a crystal form as it cools. The salt molecules that are moving around in the liquid will try to stick together. When they do they will form together in a pattern. This is how crystals occur.
 You should have a nice collection of crystal needles forming. You can scoop the crystal out with a spoon and take a closer look, or pour out the remaining liquid. The crystals will be very fragile, so handle them with care.

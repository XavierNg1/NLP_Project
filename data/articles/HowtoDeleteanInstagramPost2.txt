 This button appears in in the lower right corner and will take you to your profile page and your collection of instagram posts.


This step is only necessary if you are deleting a comment on one of your own photos.



You can only delete your own comments or comments by others on your own photos., This icon appears directly below the photo (next to the ‘heart’ button) and will open up the list of comments on that post.
 The comment will highlight and new buttons will appear in the top menu bar.
 This button is in the upper right corner and will remove the selected comment from that post. The photo itself will remain intact.


If you do not see the trashcan icon, then you likely selected a comment that you do not have permission to delete (i.e. a comment made by someone else on a photo you do not own).
If you still see a comment after deleting, try refreshing the imaging by swiping down on the screen. Comments may take a moment to be removed from the server.

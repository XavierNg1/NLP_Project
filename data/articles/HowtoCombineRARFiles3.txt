 Like PC users, Mac users will find that there are few options available for handling the .rar file format. RARLAB's solution for Mac, "RAR for Mac OS," is available for purchase from the developer. Consumers also may download a trial version of "RAR for MAC OS" from the RARLAB website.
 To set the file association, select "Settings," then "File Associations," and select the box labeled ".rar." Double click the file to open it. "RAR for MAC OS" will automatically unpack, reassemble and play the file.

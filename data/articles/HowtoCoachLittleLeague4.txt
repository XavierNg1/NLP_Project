 As the old saying goes, practice makes perfect. Schedule practice at a regular time at least twice each week. Practice provides your team with the opportunity to not only practice their skills but to bond and build trust with each other.Practice should not last more than two hours.
With regular practice, you will be able to see your team improve immensely.
 By planning out exactly what you want your team to work on during practice sessions, you won’t have to think up something for them to work on when they show up. Doing so could make your team and their parents think you’re disorganized and lacking in capability.Select only a few skills to work on in each practice session. Focus primarily on fundamentals like hitting, catching, base running, and throwing.
Reserve some time for advanced skills like run downs, situational defense, and so on.
Spend the last 30 minutes doing something that your team wants to work on like errors, run, and hits.
 If you focus on any one activity for more than 20-30 minutes, you will lose the attention of many kids. You can forestall this somewhat by encouraging your players to focus by saying things like, “Keep your head in the game!” but over too long a period, even the most attentive player will tire of the same exercise. Move your practice sessions along to prevent the players from getting bored., Scrimmages are short practice games. Depending how many players you have on your team, you should be able to divide your team into two roughly equal squads (six on six, for instance). Designate one team the “at-bat” team and the other the “on-field” team. After the on-field team scores three outs, let the players switch sides. This will allow your team to practice under more game-like conditions.

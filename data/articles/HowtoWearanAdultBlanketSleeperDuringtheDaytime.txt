 Just becoming courageous can really explain how ready you are to wearing one during the day. If you are not courageous enough to show off your entire "inner child" at night, you are definitely not even close to ready to show off your "inner child" during the day.;
, Nightwear - let alone a blanket sleeper - is the last thing people would like to see someone wearing. Most people are under the impression that blanket sleepers are only designed for infants and toddlers and that isn't at all true - and these people will go to great lengths to try to make these people depressed to the point that the wearer won't want to wear them during the day.
, Keep your body clean and smelling fresh. If you need to use deodorant to keep yourself smelling good, go for it - blanket sleepers are completely washable.
 You can use the same method on yourself, as the method used when you change your kids into them at night. However, due to most adult's length measurements, the wearer may have to drape their legs over the edge of a flat surface (such as a bed or soft-carpeted floor)., Just because you are wearing something designed for night, doesn't mean things in your daytime have to stop. As long as the blanket sleeper is super-comfortable (which it should be), you should continue to do things as normal around your house.

 Make your task easier by removing any fluid from your clothes immediately. Brush off any large, dried flakes with your hands. Do this even if you plan to send the clothes to the dry cleaners instead of tackling the stains at home.;
, Gently blot at the fluid with a rag or paper towel. Donâ€™t press the rag or paper towel into the fluid. Be careful not to rub it into your clothes.
 Make sure the fluid is completely dry. Scratch off as much as you can with your fingernail. Try brushing it off with a stiff-bristled brush. Only use a brush on thicker fabrics.

 You won't be able to see holes or tears in the mattress with the bedding on.


Move the bedding to a safe place, away from the area where you will look for leaks so that its out of the way.;
, You will need to be able to walk around the mattress, flip it, and inflate it.


If you are camping it is a good idea to do this inside a tent away from breezes and noise.
Make sure you have adequate light. You will need to be able to see well enough to look for holes.
 Air mattresses are not designed to be filled with high pressure sources such as air compressors.


You can use your breath or an air pump to inflate the mattress. Many air mattresses come with these to aid in inflation.
Do not overinflate your mattress. Most manufacturers warn that this can cause a mattress to burst.
 It is a good idea to do this before inspecting the rest of the mattress, because the valve is a common source of leaks. Doing this first can save you a lot of time rather than searching for leaks using other methods since valves are a main source of leaks. Make sure that the valve plug is completely inserted into the valve stem.
For double locking valves, make sure that the valve stem has been completely pressed against the stop behind it.
If there is a problem with the valve, it is unlikely to be able to be patched. However, if the valve plug won't seal against the valve stem you can try inserting a thin piece of plastic for a quick fix.
If the valve plug is completely inserted into the valve stem, and the valve stem is completely pressed into the stop behind it, you are ready to look for a leak in the mattress itself.

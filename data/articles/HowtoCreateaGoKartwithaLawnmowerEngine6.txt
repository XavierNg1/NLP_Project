 The location of your motor is not as important as that of the gearbox.To properly install your gearbox, align it with the gear on the rear axle, and then bolt it into place.
 A sprocket is a gear toothed wheel inside your gearbox that controls the gear ratio for your transmission, which is another name for the gearbox. Your target gear will be about 16 teeth.
 One end of your clutch should be installed into the engine, with the side protruding a sprocket connecting to your gearbox. If you lack a manual belt slip clutch, you can buy a centrifugal force clutch from your local auto parts store and use that instead.The ratio between your motor and transmission should be 1 to 1.
 Now you can clean off any residual oil from your kart, but do so with care. Always allow for sufficient time for the materials you are working on to cool, like the engine or solder, before using a cleaner.

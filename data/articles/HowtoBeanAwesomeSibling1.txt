 It’s great to remember your sibling’s birthday, but remember other days that are important, too. You may want to wish your sibling good luck on a big presentation, or make a gift for your sibling after an orchestra performance. Show that you are proud to be a sibling and that you are happy to be in his life.


Remember your sibling’s performances and make sure you attend them.
Wish your sibling good luck on big exams.
If you both have the day off of school, plan to spend it together doing fun things. Make a snow fort or a snowman.;
, Let your sibling borrow your music or your shirt. If there’s one brownie left, invite your sibling to eat it. If your sibling shows an interest in something you have, use it together.
 When your sibling does really well in a play or aces a math test, let him know that you are happy for him. If your sibling faces a fear (like singing in front of the whole school), congratulate him on being brave. Share in the happy moments with your sibling and be there with a smile to congratulate him.
 Surprises can take many forms: you can take your sibling out for ice cream, show up unannounced at your sibling’s soccer game, or leave a small gift for your sibling in his room. The best thing about surprises is that they are just as much fun to give as they are to receive!


If your sibling really likes candy, leave some candy in his room on the day before a test.
If you get two tickets to an event, invite your sibling and tell him it’s a surprise.
 If you’re crafty or like to make things, make something special for your sibling. You can make a friendship bracelet, origami paper crane, or a homemade card. If you feel really adventurous, try sewing a bag for your sibling or an article of clothing. Just make sure your sibling knows it was made just for him, with lots of love.


The nice thing about making something is that your sibling can hold on to it and remember it was gift made from you.

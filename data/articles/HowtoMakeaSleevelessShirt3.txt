 This style of sleeveless shirt is popular with people who workout frequently because it allows for more breathability.


Loose-fitting t-shirts are the best open for this style, especially if they are a bit big. The idea of this shirt is to have a baggy, open shirt in which to do strenuous activity, like weight lifting or manual labor.
This is the easiest method of making a sleeveless shirt, because it only requires two simple cuts.
 This will allow for a large open side in the shirt.This also ensures that you do not cut the side of the shirt completely open.
 Remember that you are not making this into a tank, so the width of the shirt at the shoulder should still be a good 3-4 inches wide.When you get up to the sleeve at the shoulder, you should have about an inch of fabric still attached to the sleeve as it is cut off. This allows for more fabric to be attached to the neckline, creating a muscle tee.
Pull the shirt tight as you cut to help keep a mostly straight cut. The new edges of the shirt will likely curl in on themselves a bit, but the cut should still be as straight as you can make it.
 A simple double-turn hem does the trick with minimal sewing.


Fold your new edge to the inside of the shirt ¼ inch and press. Then, fold it in again another ¼ inch and press again. Use your sewing machine and its presser foot, also known as a rolled hem foot, to sew the folds down for the hem.Repeat on the other armhole.

 It's best to wash the corn first to remove any dirt.;
, While microwave temps may vary, five or six minutes will cook the corn well for most microwaves.
 The skin should be relatively moist and tender––ripe for falling from the cob.
, Make a cut approximately one inch (2.5cm) away from the bottom to expose the actual corn on the cob.


Pull the remaining strings or pieces away to give a clean bottom. If there are remaining corn husk pieces even after you’ve removed the corn’s clothing, grab these pieces now.
 Cutting the bottom of the corn cob lets the corn pop out of the husk. Since the corn is still warm and soft from being microwaved, it should gently slide out of the cob.


Grasp the top of the corn with your oven mitts and hold the corn over a plate or bowl.
Squeeze the husk gently to dislodge the corn from the husk. Move your hand downward so that it follows the corn as it leaves the husk.
 It goes well with butter, salt and pepper or even just as it is.

 In general, newborn puppies can easily find their mothers’ nipples and begin nursing.However, some newborns may have more trouble nursing. Because colostrum is vital to a newborn puppy’s survival, and is available for only a short time after birth, each newborn puppy will need to start nursing almost immediately after birth.


Watch each newborn puppy to see which ones are nursing and which ones are not. You will need to help those that aren’t nursing on their own.;
, For a newborn puppy that isn’t nursing on its own, use your hands to gently nudge its body toward a nipple. Place the nipple in the puppy’s mouth. At this point, the puppy should start nursing.Try some other tips for encouraging nursing:Touch the puppy’s cheek to the nipple. The puppy may then turn its face and place its mouth on the nipple.
If the puppy isn’t opening its mouth, gently pry it open with your index finger. Once its mouth is on the nipple, remove your finger from its mouth.
Do not place your fingers on the puppy’s cheeks. If your fingers are on its cheeks, it may try to start sucking on your finger instead of its mother’s nipple.
 Once the newborn is latched on to its mother’s nipple, it will need to use a pushing action to get the colostrum out. It may need your help with this. To help, support the puppy’s body by placing your hands on its belly. You can also place its front paws around the nipple., Up until they’re a few weeks old, puppies need to nurse every few hours.

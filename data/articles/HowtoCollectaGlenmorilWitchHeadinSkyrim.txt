 This is the fourth mission in “The Companions” storyline that you’ll encounter at the early stage of the game once you get to the city of Whiterun. After completing a previous quest called “The Silver Hand,” you need to talk to a man with a white beard and hair named Kodlak Whitemane; he lives inside a large hall, called Jorrvaskr, east of Whiterun. He will ask you to collect one Glenmoril Witch Head.;
, Travel straight westward from Whiterun until you reach a village called Rorikstead. From Rorikstead, travel south until you reach the edge of the map. Here you’ll find Glenmoril Coven. There’s a large dead tree at the cave entrance as a landmark, so it’s hard to miss.
 Enter the cave, and inside, you should see a couple of Glenmoril Witches—creatures that look like an old lady with black feathers sticking out of its body. It also has four long fingers with sharp fingernails, similar to those of birds.
 Once you spot a Glenmoril Witch, attack it with either your weapons or magic spells. These enemies are rather easy to kill, so you can use whatever attack that suits you.
 Once the witch is defeated, approach its body and press the “Search” button as prompted on the screen to search the dead body of the witch. Select “Glenmoril Witch Head” from the list of available loots to save it to your inventory.

 Annuals typically thrive in well-drained soil with a pH between 6.3 and 6.7. Add 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) of peat moss, compost or manure to the garden soil to build up organic matter and create a healthy environment for the seeds to grow.


Consider adding a seed-starting mix to the soil. Seed-starting mixes can be found at most garden centers. These nutrient-rich mixes can encourage seed growth.
 Consult the seed packet to determine how much light the annual plant will need. Many annuals need full sun, which is considered 6 or more hours of sunlight each day. Others, such as begonias or impatiens, thrive in the shade. Choose a location best suited for the sunlight requirements of your annual seeds.
 Consult the seed packet to determine the recommended depth and spacing for planting your annual seeds. In general, plant an annual seed at a depth that is 2 or 3 times the seed's diameter.


Plant small seeds near the top of the soil. To plant very small seeds, pour the seeds into the palm of your hand, take a pinch of the seeds with the thumb and forefinger of your opposite hand, and sprinkle the seeds over the soil. Using your hand, tap the seeds lightly into the soil so they are lightly covered with soil.
Plant larger seeds further into the soil. Use a screwdriver or pencil to poke a hole into the soil at the depth recommended on the seed packet. Place the seed into the hole and fill the hole with soil. Tap the soil lightly with your hand.
 Keep the water around the seed moist, but don't over-water or create puddles of standing water around the seeds.
 Fertilize the seeds immediately after planting. In most cases, annuals planted in the ground will not need additional fertilizer after the initial application.
 As seedlings begin to emerge, thin the plants so they are not growing right on top of each other. Consult the seed packet to determine the ideal spacing between mature plants.

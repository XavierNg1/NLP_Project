 You need an ordinary duel-sided flat iron to curl your hair. A 1 inch (2.5 cm) iron will be perfect for the job. Just give it a minute or two to fully heat up.
 Sectioning your hair can help you isolate parts of your hair. This can make it a bit easier to curl your hair, especially if there's a lot of it, but it can take longer. If you're sectioning your hair, you'll need to clip or pin back the top part of your hair so you can reach the bottom strands first. If you're not, then you can start with any of your strands. As you curl more hair, you'll be sectioning less and less of it.
, Just wrap the strand of hair around your index and middle fingers until you've created a tight pin curl.
 Release your two fingers and maintain the shape of the pin curl with your other fingers.
 Place the pin curl into the iron and hold it there for a few seconds. Be careful when you place it into the iron so you avoid burning your hands.
 Once you release the iron, you can scrunch the curl and let go of it to set it.
 Continue this process on all of your strands until you've created beach waves on all of your locks. This method creates a more bouncy look than the regular curling method.
 This will help you maintain your beach waves.

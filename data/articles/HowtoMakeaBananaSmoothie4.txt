 Peel and slice the banana first, then add it to the blender. Pour the half-and-half over the banana, then blend until evenly combined. This will create a nice, smooth base for your drink.


For a thicker smoothie, use a frozen banana instead.
For a lighter smoothie, use whole milk or skim milk instead of half-and-half.
 These will give your smoothie a layer complexity and a final boost of flavor. If you aren't a fan of maple syrup, you can use another sweetener instead, such as: agave nectar, honey, jam, molasses, sugar, etc.
 Here are some ideas to get you started:


Add some cocoa or mini chocolate chips for a subtle chocolate flavor.Make a spicy-sweet smoothie by adding Â¼ teaspoon (0.65 grams) of cayenne.
 You don't want any lumps, chunks, or swirls. From time to time, you may have to pause the blender, and push the ingredients down the sides using a rubber spatula; this will ensure that everything gets evenly blended.
 You can drink it as is, or you can garnish it with extra cinnamon, nutmeg, or banana slices. To make it truly dessert-like, garnish it with a swirl of whipped cream, a drizzle of chocolate syrup, and a dash of colorful sprinkles; finish it off with a maraschino cherry on top.

 You will need a soft bristle toothbrush (an old one that you don't plan on using again will work fine), some dish soap, a small bowl with water in it, and a lint free towel. This method of cleaning your Swarovski crystal jewelry works best for deep cleaning or occasional maintenance. Don't use this method too often because it may wear off some of the thin protective plating on the crystals.
 You may want to keep a small bowl of water handy to moisten the toothbrush as you clean the crystals.
 Only use a small amount at first and add more as you go if needed. , Use the toothbrush to gently remove dirt from each crystal individually. Do not scrub the crystals. Move the toothbrush in a circular motion to gently clean away dirt. Focus on cleaning one crystal at a time. , Hold your crystals under a stream of warm running water to rinse away the soap. (CAUTION: The crystals will be slippery. You may want to place a small bowl or colander over the drain just in case you drop your crystals.)

, Gently pat dry your jewelry using a soft lint free cloth. You may also want to lay out your jewelry on the cloth until you are sure that it is completely dry. Do not put away your jewelry until it is completely dry.

 Dip a cotton ball into rubbing alcohol. Ring it out slightly – it shouldn’t be dripping wet when you use it on your leather.If your stain is bigger than a few pen marks, you should use a clean dish cloth instead of cotton balls. Stains that large might also need professional attention.
 Using minimal pressure, press the cotton ball over the ink stain and gently rub the spot. You can check every few seconds to see if it looks like the ink is coming out of the leather., Once you’ve rubbed the ink spot with rubbing alcohol, let the leather dry. Once it’s dry, you’ll be able to see whether the ink came completely out. If it didn’t, repeat the procedure as necessary.

 Both NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, and aspirin limit blood clotting, which is bad for a hemophiliac. NSAIDs limit the ability of platelets to bond together and aspirin thins the blood.It is safe for a hemophiliac to take acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain relief. Acetaminophen does not impact the blood's ability to clot.
 In addition to regular over-the-counter pain relievers, there are some prescription medicines that can promote thin blood or limit clotting. These should be avoided by hemophiliacs as well. Make sure all health care providers are aware of your condition so they do not prescribe these medications.They include:Heparin
Warfarin (Coumadin)
Clopidogrel (Plavix)
Prasugrel

, If you are a hemophiliac you will need to discuss your condition with all doctors and medical professionals that you consult with. This means that even if a doctor is not treating your hemophilia directly, they should be aware of the condition in case of a prescription medication being prescribed that could impact your clotting as a side effect.If your doctor prescribes a new medication, you can simply ask them "Will this medication have any impact on my hemophilia?" You could also say "I just want to be sure this treatment will not cause my hemophilia to worsen." Above all, just be clear and to the point.
In most cases, a doctor will consult your medical records before treating you, thus knowing that you have hemophilia. However, it is always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to risks to your health.

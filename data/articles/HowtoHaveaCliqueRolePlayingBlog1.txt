, Wordpress is the best choice, and it has the most active roleplayers! Do not use Weebly, Webs, or any of those website-making sites. You need a real blog.
 Make a gorgeous header and pick a unique background- you can ask people for help with this, or even to do it for you.
 Publish your first post and add pages. Some pages you might want to include are "About Me," "Contact," "Closet" or "Massiequin," "CSOTU" (really, any list to see what's hot and not), and a "PC" page.
 This will make your posts more interesting to read, as well as looking very polished.

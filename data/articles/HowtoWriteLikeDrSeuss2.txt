 Once you’ve chosen a good number of words that rhyme, experiment with writing sentences that use rhyme in creative, weird, and varied ways. Two common forms of rhyme are internal rhyme, which uses rhyming words within the same sentence, and end rhyme, which rhymes words at the end of two sentences.


Internal rhyme uses words that rhyme within the same sentence, such as “There is fun to be done” from The Lorax. Try writing 10-20 sentences with internal rhyme: “There is glue in my shoe” or “I’m in Heaven with Kevin,” for example.
End rhyme uses rhyming words at the end of sentences, such as “Would you? Could you? In a car?” Eat them! Eat them! Here they are,” from Green Eggs and Ham. A great way to practice end rhyme is to write a few poems using potential characters from your story. Try using an ABCB rhyme structure, where the two B lines rhyme. For example: “It’s in my hair / it’s on my nose / but luckily / I have a hose.”

, Repetition gives your writing energy. Children especially love repetitive language, because it makes lines catchy and easy to memorize. Part of what makes the line “I do not like green eggs and ham, I do not like them Sam I am” is the repetition of “I do not like.”


Play around with similar repetitive structures in your writing so that kids will want to repeat your lines again and again and again. Don’t be afraid to use questions! Questions lend themselves well to repetition and rhyme. For example, “A boat? A plane? A flying car? Not here, not there, not where you are!”

, Kids will immediately recognize language that reads as too adult or filled with obvious morals. Give in to the silliness of the world you are creating.


Focus on using rhyme, repetition, and nonsense words in a way that is fun for you and the reader. This will make the moral of your story seem more natural and intrinsic to your story, instead of blatant and overstated.

 Align them with each other, and leave enough space between them to accommodate the scale you will use.
 Make them wide and deep enough to hold standard nuts and washers., Run the threaded rods through the holes in the base. Then screw the base down with another set of lock nuts and washers. The recessed holes are so that the finished press will sit flat on a table or bench. You should now have the base sandwiched between nuts and washers at the bottom end of the threaded rods., Place washers on top. The second board may not rest on these washers when the mold is in place, but it keeps the lower 1x4 from getting a bigger hole that can cause uneven tops on cheese wheels., It will rest on the washers from the previous step.,, It will rest on top of the springs and the uppermost washers.,, Use PVC pipe 4-6" in diameter and 6-7" tall. Drill holes about 1" apart for drainage., They are needed to fill up the mold. When assembled, they will extend out of the mold and contact board 2., Screw it to the top board as shown., Put the mold on top of the bathroom scale between the two rods. Gradually tighten the wing nuts. As the plastic card goes past the middle board, draw or scribe lines at 10 pound increments. If you found springs rated for 40 pounds/inch, the marks should fall 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) apart, but mark the card for the force your springs actually exert.

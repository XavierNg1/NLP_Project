 Mark this length on the plumbing pipe.
 Saw this one half of the length off, then sandpaper the cut part to ensure neatness and remove any parts that catch. You will be left with a long fully round pipe end attached to the halved pipe end.
 Choose a base length and mark it on the piece of pipe that is still fully round pipe. Cut this end of the pipe to the desired length. Place a pipe end cap on the base.


If you're not sure how much to cut, decide whether you want to use the light standing up or lying down. If it lies down, the base end can be short. If you want it to stand upright, it will need to be longer to account for the weight and height of the light end. Alternatively, cut short and fill with pebbles or river stones before capping, to provide a base weight.
 Then insert two more above these two, to the end of the pipe half.
 Tie them around where the two sets meet, ensuring that you capture the glowsticks behind the ties so that they cannot fall out. Tie them so that you can easily slip the old glowsticks out and add new ones when needed.


Cable ties, thin gauge wire or similar can be used.
 This completes the light.
 Snap the glowsticks. Shake well before snapping.


Replace the glowsticks as needed. Bring quite a few to see you through the length of time you need the light for.

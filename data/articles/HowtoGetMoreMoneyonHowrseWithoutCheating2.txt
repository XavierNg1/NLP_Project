 Then you will gain more rank and people will try to buy horses from you.


Any filler horses (horses with a very low skill/GP that practically are worth their feed) should be sold for about 850e. If filler horses don't sell, try canceling the sale after a few days and reposting it again. An alternative is to lower the price at 50e intervals until sold.
 Buy a reasonable horse. one 500-1000e. Train it up; a horse will sell more if it trained. Sell it in the Auctions for about 2500.
 Set a limit to the price you'll pay for a filler horse (say, 800e) and also a constant price for reselling a filler horse (say 850e). Even though it takes time and speed to nab a good deal, it's worth the effort when you resell.
 This won't gain you very much very fast, but manure in your barn is useless and there still is a profit from it.
 If you go to the store you can click resell items. You can resell items you don't need.

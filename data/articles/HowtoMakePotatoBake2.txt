 You can grease the dish using a little butter, oil, or cooking spray.
 Slice the potatoes as thinly as you can; this will allow them to bake faster. Spread them evenly across the bottom of the dish, then set the dish aside.
 Cut the butter into cubes, then toss it into a small skillet. Place the skillet onto the stove, and set the heat to medium. Stir the butter occasionally to help it melt faster.
 If you have not already done so, peel and dice the onion, then add it into the skillet. Add the salt, thyme, and pepper, but hold off on the cheese and parsley. Stir the onion until it is evenly coated with butter.You do not have to brown, soften, or saut√© the onion.
 Try to cover the potatoes as evenly as you can. Don't add the cheese or parsley yet; you will be adding them towards the very end to best preserve their flavor.
 You are ready for the next step once they turn tender.Don't worry if they aren't completely done; you still have some baking left to do.
 Again, try to sprinkle them as evenly as possible. You can mix them together first, or you can sprinkle them over the potatoes in separate layers. If you choose to layer them separately, add the parsley first, then the cheese.
 They are ready when the cheese is melted., They make a great side dish to meats, such as ham and pot roast.

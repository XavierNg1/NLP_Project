 When you notice yourself thinking out loud in an inappropriate situation, stop and concentrate on using your inner monologue. Instead of vocalizing what you are working on, try "saying it" in your head. With some practice, over time you will be less reliant on thinking out loud and more comfortable using your inner monologue.For those with ADHD or impulse control, this may be more difficult. Although you may not necessarily be able to stop thinking out loud, you can dictate what you say., If you are prone to doing too much processing out loud in meeting or in class, try to put some of your thinking out loud onto paper. Take notes or draw pictures to help you connect your ideas. Write down your questions before you ask them.


Get out of the habit of talking or raising your hand without planning. If you are going to contribute to the discussion, take a moment to compose your question or comment before you open your mouth.
 If you tend to interrupt, change the subject, or ask too many questions, you may just need to learn another way to show engagement while in conversation. Try making eye contact with the person you are talking with. Nod to show you are listening. Reflect back to them to check that you are understanding what they are saying.


For instance, if they say, "I just don't know why Matthew always texts me and asks me favors: he's constantly flaking and he doesn't ever ask me about my life," you might say, "You feel like Matthew isn't really being a friend to you, but he's asking you to do the work of a friend for him."
If you lose track of what someone is saying, ask them a question.

 You can make your s'mores over any sort of fire. Keep in mind, however, that the fuel you use may also influence the flavor of the marshmallow. If you are working outdoors, make sure to follow safety precautions by having water or fire extinguisher near by, and to avoid windy days.


If you are making a campfire, be sure to use clean, dry wood, and to properly rein in the fire with a ring of stones. Do not use accelerators.;
, You will end up with two square-shaped graham crackers. This will be enough to make one s'more. One of the halves will be for the bottom of the s'more, and the other half will be for the top.
 You will need a piece of chocolate that is just a bit smaller than your graham cracker. If you have a large piece of chocolate, then break it into smaller squares.
 Take a piece of chocolate and set it down on one of the graham cracker squares. The other square should have nothing on it.
 Carefully insert a clean skewer into the side of the marshmallow. Hold the marshmallow just over the flames and let it roast to your liking. Be sure to rotate the marshmallow so that it cooks evenly.


If you are camping and wish to use a stick, be sure to shave the tip into a fine point; this will make it easier to skewer the marshmallow and get rid of any bark.
If you are using a metal skewer, make sure that it has a heat-resistant handle so that you don't burn your hand.
You can tell if the marshmallow is done if it is golden-brown in color. You can continue roasting it, set it on fire, or remove it from the fire at this point.
 Without removing the marshmallow from the skewer, place it on top of the chocolate.
 Press down on the graham cracker slightly. The hot marshmallow will melt the chocolate and help fuse everything together.
 Wait a few seconds before serving the s'more. This gives the marshmallow some time to cool down so that it doesn't burn your mouth.

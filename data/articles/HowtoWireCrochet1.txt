Annealed wire is one of the most pliable and easy to use for most wire-crafting needs.

Another good example to choose from is copper wire, it is flexible, strong, and shines.
Galvanized wire is very strong and resists corrosion, however it is harder to bend and shape it.

;
, The thickness of the wire gauge you use will influence how big or small you will be able to form the loops. As the wire gets thicker it will also be harder to bend.


Avoid using wooden or plastic hooks. The tension of the wires will dent and deform the wood needles and the plastic needles will break very easily.
Select Aluminum or steel needle that is smooth and have a thicker flat section near the grips. You will use this part of your needles to check and maintain an uniform size for your loops.
 Having loose wire that is longer than 18 inches (46 cm) can cause the wire to get tangled or kink. It is also a safety hazard; someone could trip over it or it can injure someone.


Calculate the wire length that you will need for the pattern or size of your job. It is best to use one single length of wire for the entire piece.
Don't waste excess wire or end up cutting the length of wire too short to complete your piece.
 If the spool is too big roll a sufficient amount of wire onto a smaller spool or wind it into a small loop that you can hold with your hand.

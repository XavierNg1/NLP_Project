 Measure 2 cups (473 ml) of juice into a small saucepan and stir in 2 tablespoons of grass-fed pasture-raised gelatin. Keep stirring until the gelatin is dissolved.Try to use the highest quality gelatin you can find. These will contain more nutrients than standard gelatin that's in most jello mixes.
 Heat the saucepan over medium until the jello mixture starts to bubble gently. Simmer the mixture for 10 minutes and stir it occasionally. Turn off the heat and let it sit for a few minutes.Don't let the jello sit for more than 5 minutes, since it could begin to set up and clump.
 Peel and slice your favorite fruit, so you get 1/2 to 1 cup (90 to 175 g) of sliced fruit. For example, you could use peaches, bananas, strawberries, or plums. Taste the jello and add a little sweetener, if you like. To sweeten the jello, consider using a few tablespoons of raw honey, coconut nectar or stevia.
 Arrange the fruit in the bottom of a glass baking dish or jello mold. Pour the jello mixture over the fruit and put the dish or mold in the refrigerator. Chill the jello for 3 to 4 hours, so it sets up completely. You can slice or scoop out the jello to serve it.You can refrigerate the jello overnight to help it firm up.

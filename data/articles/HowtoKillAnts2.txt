 Combine equal parts sugar and borax, then slowly mix in a little water until the solution forms a paste. Apply that paste to strips of paper or cardboard an place the traps near points of entry, food sources, and other spots frequented by the ants.


Borax, or sodium borate, is a salt of boric acid. This compound is often used for cleaning purposes and is usually sold in the detergent aisle of a supermarket.
Borax can be toxic if consumed, you should keep these traps away from small children and pets.
Ants are attracted to the sweetness of the paste and take it back to the nest, where the queen consumes it. Eventually, the borax poisons all of the ants that ingested it.
 Shake to combine, and spray any visible ants with the solution.


The oil causes the solution to stick to the ants and the dish soaps dehydrates the ants to death.
You can also spray this solution around areas that ants frequent, but it only remains effective while still wet.
 Use a baby powder or body powder that contains talc.

Sprinkle the powder liberally in areas where you see ants, especially if you can determine where they are entering your home.
Ants are unable to cross through the powder, but will be kept from getting into your home. You will need to kill any ants that remain behind inside your house.

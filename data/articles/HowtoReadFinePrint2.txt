 With regard to the fine print of any agreement or advertisement, there will be certain questions you hope to address based on the information provided. Make a list of questions you want to find the answer to in the text and skim through it accordingly. Having clear reading goals can improve your concentration and increase your reading efficiency.For example, before reading a phone contract, ask, "What are the fees for going over the monthly data limit?".
 While reading all of the fine print in contracts is challenging, looking for keywords is a good way to seek out the information you need. This information may be regarding late fees, transaction fees, and any other terms that may mean you getting charged more than what you are bargaining for. Some important words and phrases to be on the lookout for are:"Automatic renewal clause": a clause allowing a company to automatically renew your contract if you do not contact them to cancel by a certain time.
"Liability waiver": the company is freeing itself from all liability regarding loss or injury.
"Early termination fees": this refers to the penalties established for cancelling a contract early, which can be exorbitantly high.
"Unilateral amendment clause": means that the company can alter the terms of your contract at any time.
 If the fine print of a contract or agreement is thousands of words long and you can't commit to reading it all the way through, skip to the end. Many companies put important information about charges and fees towards the end of the fine print in their contracts, in the hopes that no one will read that far. Credit card applications, for instance, contain up to 5,000 words on average, making it less likely for customers to read all the relevant information detailed about high interest rates and late payment fees.

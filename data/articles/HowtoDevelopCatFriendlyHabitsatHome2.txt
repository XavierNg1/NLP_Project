 The perches should be long and wide enough to enable your cat to fully stretch and relax. Since elevated areas allow your cat to monitor its environment, perches and climbing trees provide the vertical space your cat needs to feel safe.If you have more than one cat, then make sure each cat has its own perch.
 Cardboard boxes and/or small cat-houses will allow your cat to escape to a safe place to hide if it needs to. Place the hideaways in communal spaces such as the living room or your bedroom. This way, your cat can still be a part of the family even while it is hiding.Make sure to provide multiple hideaways if you have more than one cat.
 Place bedding near various windows throughout your house. This will allow your cat to observe the outside world, providing it with some form of entertainment.It will also allow your cat to relax in the sunlight throughout the day—a cat’s favorite past time.

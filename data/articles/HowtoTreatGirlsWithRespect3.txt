 Each girl is different and has different needs than other girls. It can often be insulting to a girl to assume that she likes certain things just because she’s a girl. This implies that all girls are basically the same, which is not true. You have to understand that every girl has her own unique personality before you will be able to respect her needs and opinions. Think about the assumptions you make regarding girls, and work to overcome them.If a girl’s needs are unclear to you, ask her what she needs.
 You will not always understand the emotions of another person. This often comes to light when boys and girls struggle to understand each other’s perspectives and feelings. Even if she doesn’t feel the way you think she should, or you don’t understand how she came to feel the way she does, you have to acknowledge that it is how she feels. Her feelings are valid and do not need to meet your criteria to be important.Ask her things like “How does this make you feel?” When she answers, listen attentively and avoid any urge to disregard her feelings by saying something like “Well that doesn’t make any sense.”
Try to show empathy and provide emotional validation. For example, you can say something like, "It sounds like you had a tough day. It must have felt awful to sit through that meeting/class."

, First of all, when showing a girl respect, understand that she is her own person in charge of her own happiness. Her happiness is not in your hands. That said, when a girl decides to trust you or lean on you, try your best to meet her needs. Be supportive in tough situations, and encourage her every day.Again, you can always ask her what she needs if you are unsure.

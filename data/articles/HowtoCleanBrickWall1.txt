 Use the bristles of the broom to dislodge loose dust, dirt, cobwebs and other debris that’s built up on the surface of the brick. Be sure to reach up to the top of the wall and into any corners or crevices that might be hiding dirt.Brush horizontally away from yourself rather than straight down to keep from covering yourself in dust.
An occasional sweeping will usually be enough to keep brick walls looking good between more detailed cleanings.;
, Turn the hose on full blast and spray off any remaining dirt. Work from one end of the wall to the other, top to bottom, to avoid spreading dirt around. Once the wall dries, it will regain its original quality of finish.Cover the nozzle of the hose partially with one thumb to get more out of your water pressure.
Wipe the wall with a sponge while it’s still wet to clear away hard water stains and mineral deposits.
 If your brick wall is crumbling or shows signs of extensive wear, you can protect it using a clear silane-based sealing product. Brush a thin coating of sealant over the entire wall surface and give it ample time to dry. The sealant will help fill in weak spots, making the brick more resilient to damage and inclement weather conditions.Choose a day with clear, dry weather in the forecast to apply brick sealant. Precipitation and humidity can result in less efficient coverage.
Don’t apply a sealant until brick is totally clean, or you may end up locking in dirt for good.

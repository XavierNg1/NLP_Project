 If home remedies do not help to relieve your nausea within a day or so, or if you are vomiting, then call your physician right away to ensure that you don’t have a more serious problem.
 Nausea — often along with vomiting — is a common problem for many people. The feeling of being “sick to your stomach” can be caused by a number of different things, including:Food sensitivities or food allergies
Bacterial or viral infections
GastroEsophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and heartburn
Medications, especially chemotherapy and radiation treatments
Pregnancy (morning sickness)
Migraines and other headaches
Motion sickness
Pain

, If you have nausea with or without vomiting and it does not go away within 24 hours, call your physician for an appointment right away. If the nausea improves but you still have no appetite, have a headache or have severe stomach or abdominal pain, call your physician for advice. Nausea, especially when it’s accompanied by vomiting can be a sign of a more serious condition such as:Appendicitis
Intestinal obstruction or blockage
Cancer
Poisoning
Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD), especially if the vomit resembles coffee grounds

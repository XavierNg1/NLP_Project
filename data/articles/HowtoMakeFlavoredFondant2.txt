 This will serve as a blank canvas you can use to create any flavor you want.
 Fondant is a great base for any type of flavor. Choose the one that best suits the flavor of the cake you're making. Here are a few choices:


You can keep it simple and make vanilla fondant. Just buy a bottle of vanilla extract.
Strawberry extract makes a great fondant.
Mint pairs well with fondant's rich flavor.
For chocolate fondant, buy cocoa powder.
Almond extract will add a subtle gourmet touch.
 Take your fondant and place it on a clean work surface. Knead it to soften it. Add 3 drops of the extract and use the heels of your hands to knead it into the fondant so that it gets thoroughly flavored.


Taste it to make sure the flavor is strong enough. If not, add a few more drops.
If your hands stick to the fondant, dust them with powdered sugar before kneading.
 A few drops of food coloring can add a nice touch to your fondant. Work them in with your hands the same way you kneaded in the extract. Keep going until the color is completely distributed and the fondant has achieved the hue you want.
 Before using, roll the fondant into a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap. Let it rest at room temperature for 15 minutes before rolling it out to use it on your confection.

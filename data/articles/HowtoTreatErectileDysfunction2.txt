 Anxiety is one of the biggest culprits when it comes to ED. If you can find a way to destress, you'll be more likely to maintain erections. Think about the biggest sources of stress in your life right now. What can you do to give yourself a break?


If your schedule is packed from morning til night, think about what you can quit to give yourself more down time.

Turn off your electronics at least an hour before bed. You'll get better sleep, which is essential to destressing.
Spend more time outside. Getting fresh air and being around nature is a great way to calm anxiety.
 Do you find yourself getting distracted by worries instead of living in the moment during sex? Mindfulness is the act of being completely in the present, both physically and mentally. Clear your mind and focus on the sensations your body is feeling during sex.If sex has become routine and under stimulating, mix things up by adding new scents, textures, and sounds to the mix. For example, use massage oil or put on some music that gets you and your partner in the mood.
 Do you feel comfortable and accepted when it comes to your sexual performance? If you're worried about meeting your partner's too-high expectations or living up to some kind of standard, it will be harder to maintain an erection - it's called performance anxiety. If you think your partner's judgement might be hindering your ability to have satisfying sex, you need to communicate your needs and find ways to make your sexual environment more inviting.
 If you have deep-rooted anxieties or guilt related to sex, these negative emotions might be causing your ED. Learning more about sex can be a good way to feel more comfortable with your body and better understand your needs in bed.Read up on sex techniques or take a sex positive workshop as a way to open your mind to new possibilities and increase your comfort level.

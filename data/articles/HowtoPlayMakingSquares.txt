;
, Each player makes a line joining two dots but tries to prevent the others from making a square.
 For a while it is easy, but soon the number of dots is scarce, and it requires careful marking to prevent the squares from being formed.
 Finally all the chances are gone and the next player completes a square. As a reward this player is given another chance, thus completing several, then joins two dots and the next player continues.
 The player who has succeeded in making the most squares is the winner.

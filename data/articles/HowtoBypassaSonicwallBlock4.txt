 One way around a firewall is to connect to your home computer and browse through it using remote desktop. This will require having your home computer turned on and connected to the internet before you can use it.



This guide will show you how to configure your remote desktop.
 In order to connect to your remote desktop, you'll need to be using a service that allows you to access your computer through a web browser or through a program that doesn't need to be installed. Some of the best options for this are Chrome Remote Desktop and TeamViewer.
 Once you've connected to your remote computer, you will be able to use it as if you were there. This includes opening your web browser and browsing the web as normal. You will be using your internet connection at home to access the sites, which will bypass the SonicWall block.

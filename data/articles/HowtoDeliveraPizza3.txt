 While it’s a good idea to have a cell phone on you in general, expect these to be stolen in the event that you’re mugged. Pick up a prepaid cellphone to act as a dummy. Hide your main phone somewhere where thieves aren’t likely to search for it.Hide it on your person, rather than in your car, since that may end up being stolen, too. You could sew a liner pocket in the back of your jacket, for instance, or hide it under a baseball cap.
 If you’re delivering to an apartment building and/or neighborhood with a high crime rate, stay outside. Make the customer come to the building’s main door rather than letting them buzz you and delivering to their apartment door. Remember that going inside will make you less visible to bystanders and also severely limit your escape options.Additionally, stay in front of the building if you feel at all at risk. Do not follow customers into backyards or anywhere else away from the street where you’ll be cut off from view or escape.
 Remember that appearances can be deceiving, which means a nice-looking house in a nice-looking neighborhood may be just as dangerous (or even more so) than a crime-ridden one. If anything feels off, don’t fight the feeling, even if you aren’t quite sure why you have it. Play it safe and refrain from doing anything that makes you feel uncomfortable.This could mean anything from refusing to step inside a home or even refusing to get out of the car and make the delivery.

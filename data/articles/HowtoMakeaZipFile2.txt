 The quickest way to create a zip file is to place all of the files that you want to archive into one folder. You can place multiple files and folders into the folder that you are creating the ZIP file from.


Rename the folder to whatever you want the ZIP file to be named.
 Click the “Compress” option. The folder will be compressed into a ZIP file. The new ZIP file will be located in the same location as the folder that you compressed.


You can also select multiple files in your file explorer, right-click on one of them, and then follow the above steps. The resulting ZIP file will contain all of the selected files and will be named “Archive.zip”.

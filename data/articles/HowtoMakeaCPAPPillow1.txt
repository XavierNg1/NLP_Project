 You can buy an inexpensive firm pillow from your local department or home goods store. If you don’t want to purchase a new pillow, you can just use an old one you already own.A firm pillow will work best, since it’ll hold its shape better than a plush one.;
, Grab an old dress tie and use it to tie off the pillow to create indentations for the CPAP mask. Tie the pillow tightly two-thirds from one end.A dress tie is more durable and will feel better to lie on than string, twine, or rope. If you don't have a dress tie, try using a soft ribbon or narrow strip of fabric.
 You’d normally place a pillow on the bed horizontally, or so the longer sides face the head and foot of the bed. Instead, place the pillow vertically, so the shorter sides face the bed’s head and foot. The end of the pillow with the tie one-third down from its edge should face the foot of the bed.Try lying down on your side on the one-third section of the pillow. The tie should create spaces that comfortably fit your CPAP mask. If necessary, adjust the tie’s location to find the most comfortable position.

 Let this sit for a few minutes. Note: It is highly advised that you do a test patch on a piece of carpet out of sight first, as the lubricant might stain the carpet permanently, in which case you'll end up with a stain worse than before.


WD-40 seems to be a pretty safe bet though.If you have a selection of lubricants to pick from, choose it.
 A carpet cleaner will also work, but why waste the extra product when soap will be just fine? Massage the soap into the stain, removing both the lubricant and the ink.
 Even soap can leave an unpleasant residue, so give it a rinse with clean, warm water. Be especially concerned with the edges of the stain, as that's the easiest part of it to miss.
 Your carpet should be good as new! Run it through your fingers or vacuum it up to return it to its natural texture.

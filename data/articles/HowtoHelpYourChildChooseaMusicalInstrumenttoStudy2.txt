 Children that love to be the center of attention are drawn to instruments that steal the show. If you have an outgoing child, choose an instrument to match that personality.Flutes work great for outgoing children, as flutists are generally near the front of the band.
Louder instruments, like the saxophone and trumpet, also work well for outgoing children.
 If your child takes music lessons at school, talk to your child's music instructor. A child may have a slightly different personality playing an instrument than they do at home, and your music instructor will have a good sense of what instrument is right for your child.Make an appointment with your child's music teacher. Tell them you're trying to pick an instrument for your child and you want to know what kind of instruments your child enjoys in band.
 Analytical thinkers may take better to certain instruments. The oboe and the piano are often a good choice for a highly analytical child, for instance. These instruments require a bit more analytical thinking and inquisitiveness. For children who are less analytical and more socially oriented, go for instruments like the saxophone, trombone, and the flute.

 If you're not sure, cut about 12 inches (about 30 centimeters). If this isn't long enough, you can cut off a longer piece. Remember that when you curl a ribbon it will get shorter, so take that into account.;
, Even when the curling ribbon hasn't been curled, it will have a natural curl to it. You will want to follow that natural curl when you're using the scissors to curl it.
 The dull side will need to face downwards, towards the ground, when you're curling the ribbon with scissors. Typically the curl follows the shinier side of the ribbon.
 You want to pull this as taut as possible. It depends on whether you've already tied it to a package, or whether you're going to do that after you've curled the ribbon.


It's easier to tie the ribbon on the package and then curl it, because then you only have to grip it on one end. Otherwise you have to tape down one end to hold it in place.
If you're right handed, place the ribbon in your left hand, and vice versa if you're left handed.
 Wrap your fingers around the middle of the blades and handles (in the X that's created when the scissors are opened up). Your thumb should be holding the ribbon against the sharpened edge of the scissors

, Make sure that the ribbon is still facing dull side down.
 You need to make sure that you do this quickly. The pressure will cause the ribbon to curl.









It's important that you do this part quickly, because if you do it too slow the ribbon won't curl. In some cases it will actually get flatter.
 The curling ribbon should spiral up. If it doesn't, or isn't as curly as you want it to be, then you can try the procedure again. If it doesn't work a second time, then you'll need to get a new length of ribbon and try again.

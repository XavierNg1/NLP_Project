 Don’t set up a cart or kiosk when you’re right next to a major storefront that deals in the same thing.For instance, selling phones from a kiosk in the same mall as the Verizon or Boost Mobile store is probably a bad idea. If you do end up forced to operate in close proximity to a major competitor, take advantage of the fact that you’re a small retailer by offering a superior customer service experience.
 For example, if your target customers are motorcycle riders, then consider setting your cart up at a motorcycle rally or show.


You might find new target audiences once you get your business up and running, or, you might realize that your target audience is not who you thought it was. If that’s the case, adjust your business plan to reflect this new purchasing demographic.
Remember, if you cannot attract people who are interested in your product you will not succeed.
 However, cart kiosks can often set up at local fairs, farmer’s markets, or festivals. Check with country or municipal authorities before peddling your wares in these locations to ensure you adhere to all the regulations and meet the requirements.


Other locations like airports are prime real estate for kiosks.Contact your local airport’s business department for more information.
The lobbies in certain office buildings might also host kiosks or carts. Talk to building management for details.
 If you’re in a an interior location, be sure that you’ll be able to keep your business open during normal business hours. Before signing a lease, read it over carefully to ensure you have the best deal possible, and can meet the expectations of the contract. Common hidden costs include:


security fees
a percentage of your monthly sales
required participation in a loyalty or gift certificate program
required participation in a community service event

 You'll need to be actively using your wifi network in order to make changes to its location settings.


To log onto a wifi network, click the wifi symbol in the toolbar in the lower right-hand corner of your screen, then click your preferred network's name. You may have to enter a password before you can log on.
 This will open the network menu, from which you can select your current network.
 This will prompt a drop-down menu with network settings choices.
 Network sharing is optimal for private networks, since you don't have to worry about an unwanted member stealing your data via network share.
 When you first register a network, Windows asks if the network is "Home", "Work", or "Public"; your chosen category dictates the security settings for that network. Changing network sharing settings can alter your initial settings--for example, if you accidentally set your home network as a "Public" one, selecting "Turn on sharing..." will reformat the network to give it private attributes. Click "No, don't turn on sharing or connect to devices" if you want your network to have public attributes. This will prevent your computer from being visible to other computers and devices (e.g., Bluetooth speakers or printers). If you do this while at home, you won't be able to use your other home-networked devices from your computer.Click "Yes, turn on sharing and connect to devices" if you want your network to have private attributes. This will make your computer visible to other computers and devices, effectively bypassing the traditional "Private" network security. Be careful about doing this in a public location, since it can allow potentially harmful sources to access your computer.

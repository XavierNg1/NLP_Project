 One of the easiest ways to keep your mechanical keyboard clean is by regularly spraying it with a can of compressed air. This method involves blowing a strong stream of air onto your keyboard that pushes out all of the dust and debris that has settled in those hard-to-reach places between the keys.You can usually find cans of compressed air at office supply stores for less than $10.
Spray your mechanical keyboard with the compressed air once every few days to keep it nice and clean.
 The biggest problem with using canned air is that it doesn’t get rid of the dust and debris – it simply blows it around to settle elsewhere in the room. Vacuuming up the debris is a good solution; however, regular vacuum cleaners aren’t recommended for use with electrical devices because of the electrostatic discharge that can affect you and your computer. Instead, purchase an anti-static vacuum cleaner to suck up all the gross stuff that accumulates in your mechanical keyboard.This will help your keyboard stay cleaner for longer since you are actually eliminating the dust, rather than just blowing it around.
 Most mechanical keyboards come with a warranty from the manufacturer. Many cleaning options – like running it through the dishwasher or removing and lubricating the keycaps – may void your warranty. Check what the warranty says before proceeding because you don’t want to ruin it.Follow any cleaning instructions in the user’s manual and consider contacting the manufacturer for a replacement if necessary.

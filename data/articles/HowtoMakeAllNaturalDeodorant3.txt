 If you prefer spray-on deodorants to chalky stick deodorants, then you will love this all-natural recipe. Additionally, this recipe cuts out the baking soda found in some other recipes, which can give some people a rash from constant use.Begin by gathering the simple ingredients. This recipe requires:4 ounces of magnesium oil
10-15 drops of your favorite essential oil

, You can either purchase magnesium oil from a health retailer or simply make your own at home. To make your own simply boil half a cup of distilled water and pour the boiling mix over half a cup of magnesium chloride flakes (in a heat-safe bowl).Stir the mix together well and then allow it to cool.
 Use your favorite scent of essential oils, or you can also experiment with a mixture. Stir the ten to fifteen drops of the essential oil into the magnesium oil.You should test just a few drops of the mixture on your skin to ensure that it won’t irritate your underarms.


If the mix does irritate your skin, then you can dilute the mix with water until you find a ratio that doesn’t cause any irritation.
 You may have to test a couple of spray bottles to find one with an output you like. Find a bottle that spritzes your underarms and avoid ones that spray a stream of the deodorant. You don’t have to store the mix in any particular environment, so once you find the proper bottle, you can simply store it in your bathroom., As you get toward the bottom of the mixture, you may find a higher concentration of the essential oil than the magnesium oil, which can sting your underarms, especially if you apply just after shaving them.To help avoid this, add a new batch of the deodorant to the bottle rather than using the last little bit before replacing it.

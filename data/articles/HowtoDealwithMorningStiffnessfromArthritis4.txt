 A healthy, balanced diet is important for countless reasons, including the fact that what you eat can help prevent the frequency and severity of your symptoms.Make sure you’re getting plenty of Omega-3 fatty acids, whole grains, and are eating meals and snacks consisting mostly of colorful fruits and veggies.
 In addition to diet, healthy sleeping habits are extremely important to reducing your symptoms, especially morning stiffness. Keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool. Avoid screens of any type for an hour before bedtime, and do something that will help you wind down, like reading or gentle yoga.Try to find a comfortable sleeping position that reduces stress on your joints. For instance, sleeping sideways with a pillow between your knees can reduce some types of morning stiffness. Since the perfect sleeping position varies from person to person, take note of the position you were sleeping in whenever you wake up without morning stiffness.
If falling asleep is an issue for you, remove caffeine from your diet, particularly later in the day. Further, don’t hesitate to see a sleep specialist if you continue to have trouble sleeping.
 Another great way to help wind down for bed — and ease any tension in your joints — is a warm bath or shower before bed. This will also help you start your day if you need to get ready quickly. Further, set out clothes and pack your lunch if you know you may need to work off a bit of stiffness in the morning. Waking up ready to overcome your morning stiffness and enjoy the day will be easier if you give yourself a head start.

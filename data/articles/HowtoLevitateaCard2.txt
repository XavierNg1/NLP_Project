 You may find this special card at a magic shop or some other store. It requires a playing card, along with string. The black string comes in thick threads.You have to carefully pull out a strand of string about arm's length. One end of the string is taped or stuck to the back of your (dominant side) ear, and the other end is taped or stuck with putty to the top face of the card.
With the card in your hands, all you must do is spin it in order to make it look like a flying saucer card. From there, you can lift the string with the inside of your thumb to move it around making it look like you are levitating the card. It is ideal to wear a dark shirt (preferably black) to better hide the string from the audience.
 Many people levitate a card using a magic trick tool called Invisible Thread. You can find this thread online or at magic stores.All you have to do is wrap the thread around your wrist. Then you can bring it out when you need it with an easy twist of the wrist.
Nobody will notice, and then you can just wrap the string around the cards and make them fly into the air and levitate. The key part about this trick is to make your audience buy it. So you have to be pretty good at acting.<

, Tie the clear fishing line around your finger, and tie the other end around the card, and practice.


Use a clear string that is also strong, and tape it to the card.
Then tape the other side of the string to your ear and move your hands around to make it look like it is levitating.
 Then find a very fine thread, put it through the hole, and tie a knot on the bottom.


Tape the top of the thread to your hand. From a distance, use your pinky or thumb to lift up the last (or second to last) card.
This will make it look like it's levitating. Again, take care to watch your angles, and don't stand too close to the audience when you do the trick.

 Before you can set boundaries in your relationship, you need to figure out what your privacy boundaries are. This may involve some self-reflection and consideration on your part. Think about what parts of your life you want to share with your partner and what you want to stay private.Some things that you want private now may change in the future. As your relationship grows and you learn to trust your partner more, you may be more open with them. There’s nothing wrong with being more private at first and slowly opening up to your partner.;
, As your set privacy boundaries with your partner, you should let them know what behaviors are acceptable and unacceptable. You and your partner both should talk about what is accepted in the relationship and what is violating your privacy.For example, listening in on phone calls, looking over your shoulder read texts, or reading your emails may be violations of your privacy. Be specific so you and your partner can understand what each of you need and want.
Say to your partner, "There are some things that I would like to remain private. I do not want you reading my texts or emails. These things are off-limits."

, When you talk about your boundaries, make sure you are specific. Vague boundaries may lead to confusion, miscommunication, and problems in the relationship. Tell your partner exactly what you feel comfortable with and what you don’t.For example, you may say, “Do not look through my texts. That is a violation of my privacy” or “Please do not follow me when I go out. That is distracting me and my privacy.”

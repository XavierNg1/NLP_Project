 As the founder of the club, it might be a good idea to provide the primary meeting place at least for the first little while. If the club takes off, you may want to implement a rotation, meaning that a different member of the club takes over the hosting duties each time. A weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly schedule will likely make it easier for members to commit than trying to meet twice or three times per week.;
, Starting a club from scratch can be a bit daunting, so seeing how others are run can go a long way in easing any reservations you may have. They don’t even have to be fishing clubs - you can research similar groups to gain tips on structure, events and protocol that can be transferred to your club.

 Most fishing clubs employ a theme that centers around whatever is nearest to the members’ hearts. Some choose to highlight a particular type of fish indigenous to the area. Others devote their focus to a nearby lake, or to attracting young people or women to the sport. The theme can always change, but having one pre-chosen can help generate interest in the club.

, It should have opened up a grid showing you up to nine nearby Pokémon. Select which one you would like to track. It should minimise again, but make sure to click on the rectangle again., If there are none, it means it is extremely close, and you should be able to see it on the map. If there is one, it means the Pokémon is only a few meters or so away. If there are two, it means that the Pokémon is slightly further, and with three it is even farther., If the Pokémon is on the top left hand corner it means it is closer to you than all the other Pokémon. If it is on the bottom right hand corner, it is further away than other Pokémon., Be sure to keep an eye on the grid.

If you see the Pokémon change its position on the grid, judge if you are going the right way. If it is on the top row and before it was on the bottom row, you are getting closer.
If you find that the Pokémon is on the bottom row and before it was higher up, you should turn around and walk the opposite direction
Eventually you will find that there will be a certain point in which the Pokémon cannot get any higher up the grid, despite it not being at the top left. If this happens, go to the point where the Pokémon was highest on the grid and go either left or right. There is a 50/50 chance of going the right way. Do the same thing as above.
 Hopefully you caught your Pokémon!

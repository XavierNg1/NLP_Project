, Many geocaching websites have a special marker indicating if the geocache needs repair. If not, you can check the log to see if the cache is damaged or waterlogged, and make accommodations., Often, a damaged cache will not be in the location it started, so it may require some searching. Once the cache is found, take it someplace dry, and if necessary, wipe off dirt and water., Make sure there isn't and cracks or leaks in the cache. If there is, apply duct tape., Geocaches should always be labeled so that they are not mistaken for trash. For smaller caches, use a waterproof sticker that says something along the lines of, "Official geocache, do not remove!". If the cache is large enough though, you can use your stencil to spray paint the outside. It is recommended to use a geocache specific stencil, but letter stencils can also be used., Make sure there is, at a minimum, a log. If the log is full, take a picture of it, and replace it. Make sure to email the owner the photo, or put the photo on a geocaching website. If the cache is missing them, put in a geocaching info note and a pencil., Once all the necessary improvements are in place, use your GPS to navigate to the exact coordinates, then use the cache description to place it in the right position.

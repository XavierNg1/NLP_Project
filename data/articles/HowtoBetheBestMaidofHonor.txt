 The maid of honor is supposed to be like the bride's assistant. She helps plan the wedding, makes sure that the bride has support, and tries to make the bride's job easier. It's a big job and requires patience, time, and effort.;
, Be like her personal assistant, there to help her with everything. Do only the things you are asked to do, and ask before you do anything if you should do it.
 Ask her about a day before the wedding that she could clear her schedule for. Take her out for a spa day; get her a massage, facial, head rub, and manicure-pedicure. This will completely de-stress her and make her life a whole lot easier and more manageable!

, Most grooms are NIDs (not into details) and won't be helping the bride make the decisions about the wedding; what flavor cake, which dress, what flower arrangement, what highlights to get for the big day.... the list is endless, but it will be much more manageable with just two people.
 Does she WANT the advice you so willingly offer (or withhold?) Does she want to marry THIS man? Does she really think this wedding is a good idea? You can't ask her these things, but you have to pay attention to these things and figure it out for yourself. Give her the best advice you have when the wedding jitters kick in!

, If the chocolate in the cake always makes her blemish, tell her. If she doesn't look appealing in the wedding dress or its color doesn't complement her, tell her. If the bridesmaids dresses are ugly, tell her. If she is too stressed to think, tell her and then take her to a spa day! And most of all, if you know the groom is cheating on her, tell her. No matter how much it hurts, she will always thank you for being there for her and not lying to her. No one wants to marry the wrong person, and a cheater is definitely the wrong person!

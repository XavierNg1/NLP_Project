 To be a true mermaid, not only do you have to look the part, but you should also surround yourself with the typical mermaid environment. Though you don't need to go to the bottom of the ocean to mimic a mermaid's real home, here are some ways to come close:


If you live near the ocean, spend your days in the water or on the shore. Always leave a healthy trail of sand wherever you go.
If you don't live near the ocean, be near water as much as you can. Spend your time near a lake, a swimming pool, or a river.
Spend extra time in the shower. Mermaids love water!
If you have time for a vacation, go to an island so you can spend all the time you want near the ocean.
 Though you should spend as much time near the water as possible, you'll still need to work on cultivating a mermaid-friendly environment inside your home as well. Here are a few easy ways to transform your home into a mermaid's paradise.

Ask your parents if you can redecorate your room in an ocean theme.
Have a large fish tank filled with all of your favorite sea creatures.
Go to the beach and find shells with holes in them.
Buy Hawaiian flowers, and beach-like flowers to decorate your room.
Have lots of shells hanging up and placed around your home. Use shell plates, coasters, and even cups, if you can.
Surround yourself with pictures of the ocean. Paint your walls blue.
Surround your bed with fake coral, plants, fake seaweed, and anything else that can make you feel like you're under the sea.
Get blue curtains that will look like waves.
Use a treasure chest for storing your clothes.

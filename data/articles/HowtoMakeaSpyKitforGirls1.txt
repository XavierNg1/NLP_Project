 You'll need a bag that is big enough to hold all your supplies, but not so large that it slows you down or looks suspicious. Consider a backpack or messenger bag with lots of pockets. A dark, solid colored bag won't draw attention.


Pack a smaller purse or bag you can use if you need to ditch your big kit and take only the essentials.
If you're going in disguise, you will want your bag to match your persona. Your messenger bag or backpack will work in most situations, but if you're supposed to be an old lady, try a giant purse instead.;
, You need to write down any observations, codes, or suspicious behavior in your notebook. Try to find a small notepad that won't call attention to the fact that you're taking notes.


Write random notes on the first few pages of the notebook. This way, if someone is peeking at your notebook, they won't realize it's actually full of spy notes.
 Spying involves a lot of snooping and sneaking, and you may have to explore some dark rooms. A flashlight means you don't have to turn on the lights, but you also won't bump into anything in the dark.
 What for? Just about everything! Use it to stick a secret message under a table for your comrades to find. You can twist it to make a rope or use it to repair broken glasses. Duct tape a bad guy by taping his wrists together, or use your duct tape to help create a quick disguise (tape leaves to your hat for some camouflage).


You can use glow in the dark duct tape to mark a path for your fellow spies.

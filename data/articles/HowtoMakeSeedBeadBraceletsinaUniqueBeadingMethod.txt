Break the tube bead into two 10mm long sections.
Cut a 100mm long nylon wire and then unravel it.
Start adding on the beads: one colored glass seed bead at the center, then on each wire end, add one tube bead and one colored glass seed bead.
Add one clear glass bead on each.
Add one colored glass seed bead to the end, so that both ends of the wire are crossed through the bead.
Add another clear glass bead on each end. After tightening the wire, you will see a “bloom” pattern.;
,,, You should have a fairly symmetrical shape, with two blooms in the middle and tapered ends where two tube beads culminate in a small colored bead at the end.
 Then cross both ends together through another bead. Just repeat the actions until you get the ideal length.
 To do this, pull one end of the wire towards the starting seed bead. Then add one more colored seed bead on the bottom wire and string it through the starting bead as well. Cross pass one seed bead with both ends of the wire, as shown in the image.
 The beading methods are almost as similar as above, but the difference is that you should share the inner seed beads and tube beads to assemble the two layers together.
 Refer to the image and the directions in section 1.
 At this stage, you'll be finishing off the bracelet with two blooms in the center, between the existing four.


Cut out another section nylon wire of 100mm.
Share the tube bead and then group the 4 glass beads and seed beads as “bloom” like you did in the above steps.
After that, tie a knot at last and the whole seed bead bracelet making project is done!

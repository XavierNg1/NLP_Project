 There are two basic types of ribbon yarn: the slotted kind and the regular kind. Both types of yarn require some delicate maneuvering and special techniques.The slotted kind of ribbon yarn has edging that is made up of rectangular slots made from string. If you are working with this type of ribbon yarn, then you will be knitting into the slots only and not using the entire ribbon.
The regular type of ribbon yarn just looks like a long length of ribbon. To work with this yarn, you can knit it as usual.;
, Casting on with slotted ribbon yarn is much easier than casting on with normal yarn If your ribbon yarn is slotted, then you will cast on by inserting your needle into every other slot. You do not need to do anything else to cast on with slotted ribbon yarn.If your yarn is not slotted, then you will need to cast on in the usual way for knitting.
 Use the first slot to knit your first stitch for the row and then skip a slot after every stitch. Knitting into every other slot will help to ensure that your finished project has a ruffled look to it.If your ribbon yarn does not have slots, then just knit with it as usual. However, you may want to double wrap your yarn around the needle for your stitches in every other row. Then, unfurl the yarn in the next row to enhance the ribbon-effect of the yarn., Binding off or casting off with ribbon yarn is about the same as binding off with regular yarn. You start by knitting two stitches, and then pull the first stitch over the second stitch. Then knit another stitch, and pull the first stitch over the second stitch again. Repeat this process until you have cast off all of your stitches.Keep in mind that if your ribbon yarn is slotted, then you will be using the slots. If the ribbon yarn is not slotted, then you will just be casting off with the ribbon.

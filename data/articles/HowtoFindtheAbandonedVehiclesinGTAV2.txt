 The second vehicle is a camper van situated on a hill in the center of the wind farm., They are standing close together, so firing a shotgun will likely shoot both of them at once. If you do not want their vehicle, you can use an explosive to kill them, which will destroy the vehicle. However, the random event will not be considered complete if you destroy the vehicle before they exit.


Fleeing from them after they exit the vehicle will still complete the event.
The event will be considered complete even if you are killed by them.
If you kill one of them and leave the other, the event will not be completed, and no other random events will be available until you kill him. Alternatively, entering a barbershop, tattoo parlor, or any other similar venue will end the random event (incomplete) and other random events will become available again., They will have dropped ammo and cash. You can also take their Zirconium Journey.

 If you’re a coffee or tea drinker who likes a little sweetener in these beverages, especially if you drink several cups a day, you’d be surprised at how many calories this can add to your daily intake. In the place of sugar, simple syrup, flavored creamer, and other kinds of sweeteners, add Truvia Nectar.This sweetening technique works well for any hot beverage. You’ll find that warm and hot beverages easily dissolve Truvia.
 Smoothies can sometimes be unsatisfying without a little sweetener, especially when tart or unripe fruit has been added to them. Because Truvia has very concentrated sweetness, add it little by little to your drink and stir the beverage thoroughly until the desired level of sweetness is achieved.

You can also add Truvia directly to a blender when making smoothies. However, because of the strength of Truvia’s sweetness, only add a little. When finished blending, check its taste. If necessary, add a little more Truvia and lightly pulse the blender to mix it in.
 Health drinks can sometimes be quite unpalatable without sweetener. This can be a frequent problem for those on a juice diet, or those drinking a lot of vegetable and vegetable/fruit juice mixes. Add Truvia to these and mix the drink well with a spoon until the flavor is acceptable.

You may have mixed up a batch of lemonade, a sports drink, or some other kind of similar drink and found its sweetness wanting. In this case, save some calories using Truvia, not more powdered drink mix or sugar.
 Some of the healthiest kinds of yogurt, unfortunately, can be quite sour. If you’re trying to add more yogurt to your diet but dislike its sourness, use Truvia to tone this down and make this food more enjoyable. Remember that a little Truvia goes a long way.

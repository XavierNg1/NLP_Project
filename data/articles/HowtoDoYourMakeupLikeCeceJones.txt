, Go with mild or light colors like orange and gray. Avoid going to the browbone, and stop at the lid.
 Use this on your upper lid.
 Applying mascara and curling your lashes will be vital. You can use black or dark brown mascara. Two coats is best, and feel free to curl your lashes as well before applying mascara.
 Make sure the brush is clean! Smile for a more defined idea of the apples of your cheeks. Slowly swirl your brush or dab the blush on! Make sure there is a fairly even amount on both cheeks.
 You can use dark or mild colors. You can also even apply to all of your lips instead of just the outer parts.
 Stay away from shiny or glittery glosses, and stick to a more subtle, glossy look.
 You can use orange, or kind of a dark red color.

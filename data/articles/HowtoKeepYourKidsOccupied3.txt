 There are many museums that are specifically designed for children, and others that have special activities for children.The Association of Children's Museums can help you find a children's museum near you.


In addition to museums specifically designed for children, many have exhibits that children might find interesting. Consider natural history museums, especially those with dinosaur or Egyptian mummy exhibits, planetariums, wax museums, or aviation museums.
 No matter where you live, there’s likely to be a farm or petting zoo not far from you that will give your kids a great opportunity to interact with and learn about animals.Zoos and aquariums are also great ways for kids to learn about new animals while having fun.
 Bowling, ice skating, roller skating,swimming, gymnastics, and rock climbing are all good options. Kids will burn off energy, while also having fun and learning a new skill. You can also look for indoor trampoline parks, indoor water parks, and family fun centers in your area.
 Depending on where you live, you could visit the beach, the lake, or the mountains. Even if you don’t live near any exciting outdoor attractions, you can try visiting a local park or taking a walk or a bike ride around town.
 If you don’t have time for that or you’d like to save some money, take your children to rent a DVD/video. Make sure it is something that they will all enjoy and that they have all decided on. When you have to do a job or you are busy, get them together and put on the film.

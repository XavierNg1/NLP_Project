, While it may seem redundant with some of the work the first or second speaker has done, this is an opportunity for a new angle to be presented (e.g. impact on individual vs. impact on society). Take notes while you listen to the first speakers on the opposing side so that you can appropriately rebut key points theyâ€™ve made.
 Prepare different cases than your first and second speaker so that you are not just repeating previous examples.

 Citrus fruits will retain their flavor and appearance for between 4 and 6 months.
 This will help retain the freshness of your fruit and prevent it from turning brown after it is placed in the freezer.


Rinse the fruit under fresh, running water, then slice each fruit into pieces.
 Some fruits will require you to add ascorbic acid, fruit juice, or sugar to help retain their color and quality.


Place sliced apples, bananas, and cherries into a container, then cover them with ascorbic acid.
Mix together 1 part sugar and 2 parts water to make a syrup, then pour the syrup over fruits such as apricots, peaches, nectarines, berries, and pineapple.

 This step is simple - just use a tape measure, ruler, yardstick, or other measuring device to determine the length you want to measure in feet. In many situations, such as in schoolwork, you'll already know the length in feet that you need to convert or this information will be given to you. In these cases, you don't need to measure anything, as you can use the measurement you've been given.;
, Because there are 3.28 feet in a meter, take your measurement (in feet) and divide it by 3.28 to convert to meters. You can also multiply your measurement in feet by 0.3048 to get the exact same answer because there are 0.3048 meters in a foot.


For instance, let's say we want to know how tall we are in meters. If we're exactly 6 feet tall, we would divide 6/3.28 = 1.83 meters. Note that 6 × 0.3048 gives the same answer.
Don't forget to label your new answer in meters.
For rough, on-the-fly calculations, you may want to round your conversion factors to 3.3, 0.3, etc. to make mental math much easier. Use caution, though as these rough values will cause inaccuracies in your results.
 In the real world, it's fairly common that you'll hear distances described not as a whole number foot value (1 foot, 2 feet, 3 feet, etc.), but as some combination of feet and inches (20 feet and 11 inches, etc.). In cases where you must convert a distance in feet and inches to meters, simply divide the inches provided by 12 to find the equivalent number of feet (for fewer that 12 inches, this number will be less than 1.) Then, add this to your foot value and convert to meters as you normally would.


Let's say that we want to convert our height to meters, but we're not 6 feet tall this time. Instead, we're 5 feet 10 inches. We would solve as follows:

10 / 12 = .84
5 + .84 = 5.84 feet total
5.84 / 3.28 = 1.78 meters



You can also account for inches by turning your foot value into a fraction. 5 feet and 10 inches can be though of as 5 10/12 feet because there are 12 inches in 1 foot. Simply multiply 5 by the denominator (12) and add it to the numerator (10) to get one tidy fraction:

5 10/12
((5 × 12) + 10) / 12 = 70/12 feet.

Note that 70/12 = 5.84 - the same value as obtained above. So 70/12 × 0.3048 = 1.78 meters as well.

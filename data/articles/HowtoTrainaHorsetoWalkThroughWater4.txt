 The bank should be easily visible from the shore, free of dense foliage, and composed of sand or dirt.
 The current should not be too strong and the water should not be too deep.Avoid walking your horse through water right after a heavy rain, or during the spring. Know the depth of the water before crossing.


Water that reaches just above your knees is the ideal height for walking a horse through.
Many well-trod horse trails that cross water have a post sticking up out of the water at their deepest point indicating the water’s depth.
 Well-trod paths have usually been selected for repeated use for the very reason that they are the narrowest points in a river for some distance. If you’re forging your own path, however, look for rivers and streams where the banks of each side are closest to each other.


For instance, if you’re crossing a river that is 30 feet (10 meters) wide, but upstream you can cross at a point where the river is only 20 feet (6.6 meters) wide, head upstream to make your crossing.
There are limits to this rule. Water crossings should be at least 10 feet (3 meters) wide.Crossing water of a distance less than that could cause the horse to try to make it across in a single jump.

 When using a guitar pedal, it's necessary that you use more than one 1/4-inch cable. When using more than one pedal, you'll need even more 1/4-inch cables. The cables used to connect your pedals together can be much shorter than the cable you use to connect directly to your amp.Cables can be as small as six inches long.
 Many pedals have replaceable batteries so that you don't have to plug them into an outlet. They also come equipped with an adapter that allows you to plug the pedal directly into the wall. Make sure that the batteries are fully charged on your pedal or that it's hooked up to a power source., Plug the instrument cable into the front or the side of your electric guitar. Then, take the other end of the cable and plug it into the input jack on your guitar pedal.
 Take another instrument cable and plug it into the output jack on your pedal. If your pedal is on the pedal board, make sure that you have a long enough cord to reach the amp.
 Take the cable hanging from the output jack of your pedal and plug the other end into the input jack of your combo amp. This will complete the connection and will allow your guitar's sound to be distorted before it reaches the amp.

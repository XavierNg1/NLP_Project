 Use this method if the problem represents two or more people (or things) working together to complete a job for a part of the time, and then just one individual (or thing) finishing (or starting) the job alone. The problem should also provide the hourly rate of each individual.

For example, the problem might be: “Damarion can clean the cat shelter in 8 hours, and Cassandra can clean the shelter in 4 hours. They work together for 2 hours, but then Cassandra leaves to take some cats to the vet. How long will it take for Damarion to finish cleaning the shelter on his own?”


, The hourly rate is is represented by creating a fraction, where the total number hours it takes to complete the job is the denominator (bottom number), and 1 is the numerator (top number).For example, if Damarion can clean the cat shelter in 8 hours, his hourly rate is 18{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}}; that is, each hour he completes 18{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}} of a room. If Cassandra takes 4 hours to clean the shelter, her hourly rate is 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}}.
 To do this, add their hourly rates together. For complete instructions on how to add fractions, read the article Add Fractions.

For example, if Damarion cleans 18{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}} of the room in an hour, and Cassandra completes 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}} of the room an hour, together they will complete 18+14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{4}}} of the room in an hour:18+14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{4}}}=216+416{\displaystyle ={\frac {2}{16}}+{\frac {4}{16}}}=616{\displaystyle ={\frac {6}{16}}}


, To do this, multiply how much they complete in an hour by how many hours they worked together.For complete instructions on how to multiply fractions, read Multiply Fractions.

For example, if Damarion and Cassandra together clean 616{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{16}}} of the shelter in 1 hour, in two hours they complete twice that much:616×2{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{16}}\times 2}=1216{\displaystyle ={\frac {12}{16}}}=34{\displaystyle ={\frac {3}{4}}} of the shelter


, To do this, subtract the fraction of what they did from 1 whole. For complete instructions on how to subtract fractions, read Subtract Fractions.

For example, if Damarion and Cassandra cleaned 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}} of the shelter in 2 hours, then after Cassandra leaves, Damarion has to clean 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}} of the shelter on his own.
 You are looking for how long it will take the work to be completed by the remaining individual. To do this, you need to multiply the individual’s hourly rate times the number of hours (h{\displaystyle h}) it will take to complete the job. This will be equal to the amount of the job that needs to be finished.For example, if Damarion cleans the shelter at a rate of 18{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}} per hour, and he needs to complete 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}} of the job on his own, you equation will be 18h=14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}h={\frac {1}{4}}}, or, more simply, h8=14{\displaystyle {\frac {h}{8}}={\frac {1}{4}}}


, To do this, cross multiply the two fractions. Make sure to simplify the fractions, if necessary. This will give you the number of hours it takes the remaining person to complete the job on his or her own.

For example:h8=14{\displaystyle {\frac {h}{8}}={\frac {1}{4}}}4h=8{\displaystyle 4h=8}h=2{\displaystyle h=2}So, it will take Damarion 2 hours to complete the job on his own.

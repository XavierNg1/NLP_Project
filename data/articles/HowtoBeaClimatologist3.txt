 Once you enroll at a university, get in touch with the department that offers the climatology-related major you intend to pursue. Ask to speak with the department’s undergraduate advisor, who should be able to help you arrange the first quarter’s or semester’s coursework in line with your career interests.


As you progress in your studies, your professional interests may change. Meet with your advisor at least before each registration period to discuss adapting your coursework to other careers.
 It's never too early to start looking for an internship once you've begun your university studies. Be sure to ask your academic advisor about the internships offered through the department in sectors of professional climatology that interest you.


Many internships are available through the same government-supported agencies that employ about one-quarter of climatologists nationally, such as NOAA,the EPA, NASA,and NCAR/UCAR., A fellowship can provide partial or full funding for your undergraduate or graduate studies, offer placement in a government agency, or link up postdoctoral scientists with research positions.Talk to a professor or advisor about how you can take advantage of fellowships to advance your career in the field.


The EPA offers a range of fellowships that undergraduate, graduate, or post-doctoral job-seekers can take advantage of., Jobs in climatology are more widely available for people with a graduate degree. A master's degree is required for many positions, and a Ph.D. is typically necessary in order to do research.Job competition for climatology positions is expected to increase, as graduates will increasingly outnumber job openings. Holding an M.A. or Ph.D. will significantly improve your job prospects.

 You could hide in a clan meeting tent or citadel if you are in an active clan, but otherwise, try hiding in your Player Owned House or going Dungeoneering alone.;
, Not many people tend to visit the deep Wilderness, but watch out for PKers and aggressive monsters! You could also try visiting areas on free-to-play worlds that are of little significance to non-members, such as hanging around far south-east of Varrock.
 If you want to occupy a territory, you need soldiers to enforce your staked claim. Your clan could always back you up, but otherwise, make some friends and ask them to join you. You could even set up a friends chat.
 If you are in an area with other players, but each other player is, say, a bot, then you can still call the land your own, because no one would fight you for it.
 Hide in a resource dungeon. Not many people have the Dungeoneering level to access certain secret areas.
 That is, if you are strong enough. If you manage to do so, it is yours.

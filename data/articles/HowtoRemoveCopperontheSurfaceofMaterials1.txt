 Hydrogen peroxide will help to oxidize the copper. Unfortunately, it can degrade pretty quickly, making your solution weaker. Start off with about 30 mL of hydrogen peroxide in a beaker.You can add more hydrogen peroxide to keep the reaction going longer. This will be necessary if you have a lot of material (more than the size of a penny).
You should use a solution of 35% hydrogen peroxide or stronger.;
, Add twice as much vinegar as you did hydrogen peroxide. The vinegar will help to make the solution more acidic. This will act on the copper ions that are formed by the hydrogen peroxide oxidation.For example, if you add 30 mL of hydrogen peroxide, you will need 60 mL of vinegar.
 When you submerge the material, you will start to see bubbling. This is an indication that the reaction is going. As the reaction proceeds, you will start to notice the solution turn blue.Note that this reaction takes a long time, and it is not particularly effective. If you have a large object or a thick layer of copper, another method should be used. Just to remove the copper from a penny it could take hours or days.
Remove the object when you are finished and pour the solution into a labeled bottle. The solution should be turned over to a professional waste contractor.

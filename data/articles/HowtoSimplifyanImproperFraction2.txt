 An improper fraction is a fraction that has a larger numerator than denominator.For example, 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}} is an improper fraction, because 10>4{\displaystyle 10>4}.
 Remember that the fraction bar can be interpreted as a division symbol.To simplify an improper fraction, you must turn it into a mixed number, which includes a whole number and a fraction together. The number of times you can divide the numerator evenly by the denominator will be the whole number of your mixed number. Write this number down, and note the remainder.

The denominator will not divide evenly into the numerator. The remainder will be interpreted as the fraction part of your mixed number.

For example, for the fraction 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}} complete the calculation 10รท4=2R2{\displaystyle 10\div 4=2R2}. So the whole number of your fraction will be 2{\displaystyle 2}.
 To do this, take the remainder, and place it over the denominator of the original improper fraction. Combine this new fraction with the whole number, and you have your mixed number.

For example, 10รท4=2R2{\displaystyle 10\div 4=2R2}, so the fraction would be 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}}. So 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}} is equal to 224{\displaystyle 2{\frac {2}{4}}}.
 Sometimes the fraction of your mixed number will need to be reduced before you reach your final, simplified answer.For example, if your mixed number is 224{\displaystyle 2{\frac {2}{4}}}, you could simplify it to 212{\displaystyle 2{\frac {1}{2}}}.

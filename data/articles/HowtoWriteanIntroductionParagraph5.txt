 The quotation can be famous, insightful, or unexpected, but regardless of the content or type you choose, the quotation must have direct relevance to your topic.


The quotation can be a famous saying, words from someone famous, a snippet from song lyrics, or a short poem.
Do not insert a hanging quote. A “hanging quote” refers to a quotation that has no introduction or no explanation after it. In other words, the sentence with your quotation in it must contain other content aside from the quotation itself.
 Context can who spoke or wrote the words originally, what the words are referring to, the time period the quotation came from, or how the quotation addresses your topic.


Note that unless the quotation is anonymous, you must always state who is responsible for it.
This context will also introduce the topic of your paper and lead into supporting details that can introduce your thesis.
 Come out with a single statement that defines, in clear terms, what your paper is about.


A thesis statement is a single sentence that defines a specific point or idea about a broader topic that your entire paper is built around.
The thesis statement for this type of introduction will need to make sense in regards to the quotation you used. You should not use a general quotation that touches on the overall, broad topic but has nothing to do with the specifics of your thesis.

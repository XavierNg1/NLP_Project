 Some pain is expected when braces are first put on your teeth. If, however, you are still experiencing intolerable pain after a few weeks, you may want to visit your orthodontist to check in and ask questions.
 If the pain from your braces is too intense, it is possible that they are too tight. Having tighter braces does not necessarily mean that they will work better or that your teeth will straighten faster.Ask your orthodontist’s opinion about the tightness of the braces.
 Sometimes, there are short ends of wires on the braces that will protrude and rub against the inside of your cheek. These can be extremely uncomfortable and cause mouth sores. If you have these, ask your orthodontist to snip the ends off of these wires, and you should feel immediate relief.
 Your orthodontist might be able to prescribe a stronger dose of ibuprofen for you if regular over-the-counter medications don’t seem to be working.


Your orthodontist might also recommend other treatments, such as a bite wafer. This is a product that you bite on for a few minutes several times every hour. The motion of biting helps generate blood circulation in your gums, which can ease pain., Your orthodontist may have recommendations that will help you figure out your specific case and pain management plan. They have worked with many different people and have seen a number of different remedies that have worked for patients.

 Make sure that the ends of the pencils come up past the top of the bottle. This will ensure that they touch the ground when the bottle is upside down. The pencils will allow you to stand the bottle up on itâ€™s top., Put two tablespoons of baking soda in a tissue and roll it up. Make sure that the sides are folded over so that no baking soda is exposed. This will provide a time delay on the very rapid vinegar and baking soda reaction., Use a funnel to fill the bottle with vinegar. The vinegar is acidic and will react with the basic baking soda to neutralize. Carbon dioxide will be produced in this reaction, which will cause pressure to build inside the bottle., Drop the baking soda packet into the vinegar. From this point forward, you will need to move quickly. The tissue will unravel quickly. The reaction will start as soon as the baking soda comes in contact with the vinegar., Quickly place the cork in the opening of the bottle. This will prevent gasses from leaving the bottle and cause pressure to build. With the cork in, set the bottle upside down on the pencils., As the tissue unravels and the baking soda and vinegar react, more and more gas will build inside the bottle. This will force the cork out from the bottom of the rocket. That force will propel the rocket off of the ground and into the air.

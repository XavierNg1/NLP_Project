, Now that you're friends, just call them, saying, "Hey, I'm bored. What are you doing?" Just random talk helps.
 Go walking at night, or jump in the shallow pool at a very familiar place -- as if it is just out of nowhere, with your clothes on! Make sure that you kick off shoes and have no papers in your pockets to ruin, "Practice it and stick to rather shallow water!" (that you can stand up in): Wet clothes can be very heavy and shoes are almost impossible to swim in!

, Your friends needs to know that they have your trust. Tell them a bigger secret and say, "I just needed to blab, you won't tell anyone right?" Hopefully, they will say, "No!"

, Go relax at the pool, you don't have to talk, just sit back. Maybe making some small talk, that's not a big deal. You could go to the mall, walk and browse and joke about clothes and other stuff in store windows, or go to a sports game, or watch TV (but of course it has to be their choice of shows, or skip it if they show no interest...).
 Would you say this or that certain person is one of them? If so, you have successfully made a best friend! If not, keep trying!

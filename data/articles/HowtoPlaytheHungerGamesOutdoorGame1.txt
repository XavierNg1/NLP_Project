 Six people is a good minimum, but the best games have around twelve. Distribute walkie-talkies so you can alert people if you're "killed". Alternatively, get everyone's phone number so that you can do alerts by text.;
, The first thing you’ll need to do is make sure the area is large enough for the group you have. Try to find an area that encompasses a number of different terrains, from urban, to a large field, to rocky terrain.
 Make sure everyone is clear on the boundary lines and the rules, because anyone who goes out of bounds or breaks a rule will immediately be dead.


When fighting, a hit to the torso should be a “kill”, whereas a hit to the ankle or any other insignificant place should not count as a “kill”. If anyone plays dirty (i.e. hitting someone in the face), the offender is "killed" instead.
 Toy bows and arrows, play swords, and things like that from the dollar store should suffice. The more diverse you can make the selection of weapons, the more fun you can have. You can also make the weapons yourself. Ideas include:


A crossbow out of household items
A pen blowgun
A bow using a ruler
Five-minute bow and arrows
A mini bow and arrows

, Have each player bring a backpack and a set of supplies. Before you start the games, put a bottle of water, a snack (like a granola bar or pack of crackers), a couple of weapons, and a jacket in each backpack. Place them in the center of your area.


If you want, you can also make special packages which one person can hide around the playing area. Put extra food, weapons, or other items in the package to help the players through their game.
 The announcer is responsible for enforcing the rules, keeping track of everyone's alive status, and letting the other players know who is still alive. The announcer will also be the mediator for any disputes. Give the announcer a walkie-talkie so the player can alert the announcer if they die.

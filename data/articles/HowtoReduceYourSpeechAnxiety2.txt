 We tend to fear things that are out of our control. Though you cannot control every aspect of your presentation, you can reduce speech anxiety by controlling the situation as much as possible. If you are asked to give a speech, find out the expectations of the organizer.


For example, are you giving a speech on a particular topic, or do you get to choose your topic? How long is the speech supposed to last? How long do you have to prepare the speech?
Knowing these elements from the very beginning will help reduce your anxiety.
 The more you know your topic, the less nervous you will feel when you talk about it in front of others.Choose something about which you are passionate to address in your speech. If you do not get to choose the topic, at least try to find an angle that interests you and which you know something about.
Research more than you think you should. Not everything you learn will end up in your speech, but it builds your confidence in the subject matter.
 Be sure to know who your audience is. This is key because you will tailor your speech to this audience. For example, you will give a different speech to experts than the speech you’d give to novices.
 Use language in your speech that fits your speaking style. Try not to adopt a way of speaking that isn’t natural or comfortable, as your discomfort in the style of the speech will likely come across in your delivery.
 The more prepared you are, the less anxiety you will feel. Have the entire speech written out beforehand. Find appropriate illustrations and examples for your audience. Create effective and professional-looking presentation aids to accompany your speech.


Have a back-up plan. Consider what you will do if your presentation aids do not work due to equipment malfunction or power outage. For example, print out a copy of your slides to refer to should your slide show not work. Decide how you will fill the time if your video does not work.

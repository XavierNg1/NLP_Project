 Plant outwards from there. Make sure that where the trunk becomes wider and the roots are exposed that the bark remains uncovered. Do not create a raised flower bed around the tree base. The bark on the exposed roots of a tree needs oxygen, and if the roots are covered they will rot over time., You want to allow as much light as you can to reach the flowers and plants below your tree. So get out a pair of trimming shears and trim any low, thin branches. Remember, however, that living branches should be on at least ⅔ of the plant’s height, so never trim more than ⅓ of the living branches of your tree. You can get pruning shears at a hardware store.Only remove branches that are less than 5 cm in diameter.
Trim thin V-shaped branches. Avoid trimming healthy U-shaped branches.
If you are pruning a small branch, trim it about 1/4 inch out from a bud. If you are pruning a larger branch, then cut it just outside the raised collar area outside of the trunk., Depending on the kind of tree you are planting under, you should be more careful about how many plants you plant. You may want to plant under a tree that is better suited for gardening at its base. If you do have a tree that is more sensitive, consider starting small and choose a few small plants rather than creating a dense garden at the base of the tree. If you have a tree that is sensitive, create a plan for your garden that will span a few years, so your tree can gradually acclimate to the new planting. Be cautious when planting under these trees because they are sensitive about having their roots disturbed:

Beeches
Black oak
Buckeyes
Cherries and plums
Dogwoods
Hemlocks
Larches
Lindens
Magnolias
Pines
Red oaks
Scarlet oaks
Sugar maples

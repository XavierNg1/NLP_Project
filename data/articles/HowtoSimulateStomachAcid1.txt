The acidity of stomach acid is usually in the range of 1 to 3 on the pH scale. It can decrease in acidity as food enters the stomach.The pH scale goes from 0 (extremely acidic) to 15 (extremely basic). Water is neutral at 7.;
, Like vinegar, lemon juice can be used to simulate stomach acid. Bottled lemon juice tends to be more stable in its pH than fresh squeezed, though you can use either. Lemon juice is at about a 2 on the pH scale.Lime juice is on par with lemon juice, at about 2 on the pH scale., Orange juice isn't quite as acidic as lemon juice. It's about a 3 on the pH scale. However, it will do in a pinch, as it is still acidic.Grapefruit juice is on a similar level to orange juice and can also be used; the canned version is slightly more acidic.

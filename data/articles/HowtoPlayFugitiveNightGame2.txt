 Once they finish counting, the game begins.
 They are free to run around and try to tag the fugitives. Have some cops stay back and guard the home base so that the fugitives have a smaller chance of getting back easily.
 If a fugitive is tagged, they go to jail and cannot get out of jail unless one of their teammates tags them and gets them out of jail.
 If a fugitive makes it back to home base, they are safe, as long as they stay on home base. If they step out of the home base, they can be tagged and sent to jail.



If all the fugitives make it back to the home base without going to jail, they win.
If the cops tag all the remaining fugitives before they make it back to home base, they win.
 After winning, the winning team can decideÂ if they want to rotate teams or stay the same.


For example, if the cops won, they can choose to become the fugitive team and the fugitive team become the cops. If they don't want to change, they can choose to stay in whatever position they are in and play again.

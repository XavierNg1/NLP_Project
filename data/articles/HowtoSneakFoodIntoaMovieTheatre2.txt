 Wear large and baggy clothing and then hide small snacks in your pockets. For example, you could wear a pair of cargo pants, preferably a pair with plenty of pockets and hide candy or chocolate in the pockets. Take a look in the mirror before leaving your house to make sure that none of the food is visible., In some instances, the food you want to sneak in may be too large to fit into your sweater or pant pockets. If this is the case, you can roll up your coat or jacket and hold it over your arm. Wrap any food items inside your jacket. It will just look like you are carrying your jacket and no one will suspect that food is hidden inside!


Alternatively, you can hide food up the front of your jacket. You may look larger than normal, but chances are an employee will not ask you to lift your shirt unless it looks very suspicious.
 This works best with long skinny items, such as chocolate bars. Hold your arms casually at your sides and no one will look twice.


You can tie the food to your arm using an elastic band or string. This way the food will not fall out while you are walking and swinging your arms.
 No one will look twice if you don't give them a reason to be suspicious. Act normal and do not keep checking your bag or pockets.If you do get caught, apologize and admit that you were bringing in food. Chances are they will just confiscate the food and allow you to stay and watch the movie.

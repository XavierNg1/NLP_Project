 There are three common kinds of wipers and they each fasten to the car differently.









Bolt-on wipers are held onto a threaded drive arm by a nut.
Clip-on wipers are pressed down over the drive arm and clip into place.
Spring-loaded wipers are held in place by a spring. The spring must be compressed by pressing a pin in order to release it from the drive arm.
 Be certain that the replacement wiper arm is identical to the old arm that you are replacing. Remember that the passenger's side and driver's side arms are often different and are not interchangeable.
 You will at least need to have a flat head screwdriver, some cardboard to protect the paint/glass, and a ratchet set. It helps to have everything out and ready before you start the job.

 You can absolutely wash your hair extensions, but it pays to take a little extra care. Be sure to wash and condition from top to bottom rather than washing your hair upside down or piling it up on top of your head. Put shampoo/conditioner in your hands and run hair through your palms. Avoid washing hair upside down in the sink or scrunching on top of your head.


Choose hydrating or moisture-replenishing shampoos and conditioners. A leave-in spray conditioner is great, especially on ends.
Be extremely careful when combing or brushing hair. Work from the ends slowly toward the scalp, gently removing tangles. Do not yank, scrub, or rub the hair.
 You can use mouse, gel and hairspray on your extensions as long as those products are alcohol-free. It's best to stay away from shines, sheens or oils.
 At bedtime, braid hair into two side braids or secure in a loose ponytail to prevent tangling. If you've curled your hair, try sleeping on a satin pillow to help keep your curls in place.
 Salt water and chlorinated water are very drying to hair and can cause major color fading or discoloration. If you're going into the water, put on a swim cap first.

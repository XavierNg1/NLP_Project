, For most of us, Music and Photos & Camera take up the most space. Just like too much weight in your backpack will tire you when hiking, too many large files will slow your iPhone. So delete some large files and lighten to load on your phone.
 Find the songs you no longer want, swipe to the right and press Delete.
 Connect iPhone with your PC and open Image Capture: tick “Delete after import” at the bottom. Or you can delete photos on your iPhone: open Photos, tap 'Select' and then tap on the pictures or videos you want to delete.
 Tap on video to see the details of your movie and TV series. Just slide the title to the left and confirm delete directly or operate through the "Edit" on the top right.

 Choose a day when you don’t have anything else going on, such as a free Saturday or a day off work or school. Sorting through clothes can be time-consuming, and you don’t want to get frustrated because you run out of time in the middle of your de-cluttering extravaganza.

To make this process more fun, put on some upbeat music while you sort.
 Closets, more than any other spot in your house, collect things. These will be the areas of your home where most unused clothes and shoes are located. Start with bedroom closets, and then move to any hall or storage closets., If you haven’t worn something in over a year, consider giving it away. If something doesn’t fit you, it may also belong in the donate pile. Remember, something that isn’t perfect for you anymore could be someone else’s treasure.You can make three piles: “Keep,” “Give Away,” and “Unsure.” At the very end of your sorting, revisit the “Unsure” pile and ask yourself “will I really wear this again?” for every item.
 While it may be tempting to give away that pair of totally ruined jeans, resist that urge. You’re creating more work for donation centers when you give them items that can’t be reused by other people.For clothes that are in total disrepair, consider ripping them up to make cleaning rags. You can also look online for clothing recycling centers, which are different than donation centers.
 Many people who haven’t worked in a while or are in between jobs rely on donated professional clothing to find new jobs. They may not be able to afford full-price suits, shirts, and slacks, so anything you donate could be put to very good use.Professional shoes are also in high demand.
Even out-of-date professional clothing can be useful. People may be able to have these items tailored and still spend less than they would on new professional clothing.

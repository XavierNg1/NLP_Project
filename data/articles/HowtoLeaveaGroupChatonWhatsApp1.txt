 This is a green app with a white speech bubble outline. If you've already set up WhatsApp, doing so will take you to the last item you had open.

If you haven't yet set up WhatsApp, do so before proceeding.;
, It's a speech bubble icon at the bottom of the screen.

If WhatsApp opens to a different conversation, first tap the "Back" button in the top-left corner of the screen.
 Doing so will bring up a couple of options on the right side of the conversation., You'll see this grey button to the left of the Archive option., It's in the pop-up menu at the bottom of the screen.

If you'd rather not notify people that you've left, mute the conversation instead so that you don't get notified about it anymore.
 Doing so will confirm your choice and remove you from the group.

Leaving a group won't delete it from the Chats page.

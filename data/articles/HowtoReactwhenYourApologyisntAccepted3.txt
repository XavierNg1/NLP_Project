 After having a candid conversation, develop a plan, either together or separately, to avoid these problems. For instance, if they were mad at you for interrupting them in a meeting, then put forth an effort to be more patient and to be a better listener., The person you have wronged might need a bit of time to reflect on what happened as well as the apology. Give them that time. Don’t blow their phone up continuing to ask for forgiveness; remember that you have already done that. You can check in every few days, if you haven’t heard from them, but after a few weeks, avoid always being the first to reach out., Don’t badmouth them or gossip about them to others, especially if you are coworkers. Be cordial when you see them and greet them with a “hello” and a smile. Though you might not be friends, you never know if you will need them in the future, so don’t add any more problems to your dynamic., At the end of the day, some people are simply unwilling to forgive, and they have that right. Avoid dwelling on the issue, especially if you have done what you can to make amends. Work to avoid making the same mistakes in the future and to create strong friendships and working relationships with others.

 Charcoal grills are the most common type of grill and are the most affordable, usually costing between $100 and $300 for high quality.Many prefer them for the particularly smoky taste that they provide by being fueled with charcoal. Charcoal grills take longer to start up and require cleanup after each use., Gas grills are fueled by liquid propane or natural gas and give you better control of temperature. You can get a good quality gas grill from around $200 to about $400. There are gas grills out there with price tags in the thousands, but even if you really want to impress neighbors, gas grills any more expensive than $800 don’t increase much in quality.This option may be more expensive, but it requires a bit less time and effort., Electric grills are great for those who don’t care to deal with the inconvenience of traditional grilling. Gas and charcoal grills provide more flavor but can require a few different products and steps. With electric grills, you just plug it into an outlet and you’re good to go., Smokers slow cook large amounts of food over a longer period of time, and pack in the flavor. Smokers are much bigger than your average grill and can function electronically or be fueled by charcoal or propane., While charcoal, gas, electric, and smokers are the most popular, there are several other grill types that might fit your needs better. Some other types of grills are:


Hybrid: a grill that can use propane one day and charcoal the next.
Pellet: a grill that functions much like a charcoal grill, but uses mesquite, pecan, apple, or hickory wood chips instead.
Portable: a mobile grill that’s ideal for camping and tailgating, and comes in either gas, charcoal, or electric.

 Unlike kneaded erasers, which you might be able to fashion out of material you have around, you will likely have to buy a vinyl eraser.


You can buy vinyl erasers in many different shapes. Try to find the one that is best for your needs.



Erasils can be held and used like a pencil. They are vinyl and should be used carefully, like any vinyl eraser. , It is best to test an erasing method before starting to erase large portions. Erasing can cause streaking. By testing first, you can ensure that you will not ruin your picture.


Rub gently in a small circle to test. If you notice streaking, rub more gently. If you notice streaking, consider trying another method.
 Be very careful. Vinyl erasers are the hardest, stiffest type of eraser. It is very easy to accidentally tear through paper when using them.The edge of a vinyl eraser is the most effective part. Use the edge of the eraser for the best results.
If you need to completely remove all of the colored pencil, erase gently until the colored pencil is totally removed.

 Go to movies, spend time with your girlfriend/boyfriend, go to a spa or gym, workout for yourself, or do anything that you like, such as a hobby.;
, Always keep chewing gum, a lollipop, or a water bottle on hand because when you think you need to smoke, you can use those instead.
 Praising will help you.
 Talk to someone, like a parent, friend, school nurse, doctor, counselor, or anybody you trust. Having someone to help can inspire you to quit smoking.
 The only way to quit is to make a long-term commitment. Keep encouraging yourself as well.
 If you are buying your cigarettes, you'll save money not smoking. If you steal them or buy them underage, you'll stop breaking the law if you quit. Your health will improve if you stop smoking and you will be at less risk of lung cancer and oral cancer and throat cancer. You won't smell like an ashtray most of the time if you stop smoking., If you succeed, then you'll be much happier with yourself!

 Don’t assume that everyone is familiar with (or remembers) the regulations. Giving everyone a quick overview will make sure that nobody will be left in the dark about the rules.
 Sometimes tournaments run without a hitch, and sometimes they don’t. Be available at tournament headquarters to address any of the competitors’ concerns or questions.
 As the tournament organizer, your primary responsibility is to make sure the competition is smoothly and fairly run. By conducting the weighing or counting yourself, or overseeing whoever is in charge of it, you can attest to the legitimacy of the process.
 Once the fish have been weighed or counted, it’s time to reward those who had the best results. It’s a great way to end a fun day—and a long but ultimately rewarding process.

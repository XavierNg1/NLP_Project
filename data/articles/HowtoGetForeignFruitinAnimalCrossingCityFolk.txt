 This only works if their town has a different native fruit than you or if they already have more exotic fruits. You can also just ask them to mail you fruit.
 Use perfect grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Attach a native fruit to the letter. Wait a day to get mail. You may receive furniture, other gifts, or non-native fruit. A good message to write is: "Please send fruit back." About half the residents will send back a fruit, either native or non-native., This will occur on random days., Plant it. Then you will have a lot of fruit to sell later.

 When you are stressed, a hormone called cortisol is released. Cortisol can increase your blood sugar and cause you to gain more weight. If you have an extremely busy lifestyle, you might try to find ways to cut out stressors from your daily life.

"Mindful" exercise such as Tai Chi or yoga can help release stress while letting you exercise at the same time., Aim for seven or eight hours of sleep a night. The amount of sleep that you get can affect how much hunger hormones are released into your body. Getting less than six or more than nine hours a night can cause you to eat more., Starving yourself actually has a negative effect on weight loss, funny enough. When you deprive your body of essential energy, it believes that it needs to start saving up energy to prepare for a period where it might not be getting as much food. In other words, your body prepares for hibernation. Instead of losing fat, you're likely to lose muscle and other lean tissue. That's not a good recipe for real weight loss.

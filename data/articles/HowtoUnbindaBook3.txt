 Hold the book firmly in your hands and use a set of needle nose pliers to straighten out the bent binding on the bottom of the book. The coil, which looked like a hook, should now be straight., If you don't want to save the front or back cover of the book, you can remove them by simply pulling them out. Remove any detachable pages inside of your book to make it easier to remove the coil., Use your fingers to push and rotate the coil. It should start to unwind on the other side and exit on the top of the book. Continue spinning until the entire coil is detached.

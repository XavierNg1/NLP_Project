 Locate Talkatone on your home screen or app drawer. It should look like a blue phone inside a white icon with blue round the outside. Tap to open.


If your device does not have it, you can download the app from Google Play.
 If you haven’t set up Talkatone, you need to do so in order to make free calls. If you have already set up Talkatone, proceed to the next step.


Once the app is open hit the “Sign up” button. Type in your information in the given fields and hit “OK.” There should be a small box that pops up and says that the app doesn’t allow 911 calls. Hit “Okay” to continue.
On the next page there should be a list of phone numbers. The the number that you chose from this list will become your new phone number through Talkatone. Tap one to select it, then hit “Get number.”
The next page will be a confirmation page. A confirmation email will be sent to your email address. To activate the new account, it must be verified within 24 hours. Open the verification email in an app or a browser, and click the verification button.
Tap the “Get Started” button to continue.
 Tapping the second icon from the right, which should look like a person icon, will open your contact list. These contacts are the ones you have on your device and from Google+.
 Tap the name of a contact you want to call to open his/her profile. At the top right of the page should be 3 icons: a little phone, a camera, and 3 dots. Tap the phone to make a call.


To end a call, just tap the red hangup button at the bottom middle of the screen.
You can use this service to call landlines and cell phones for free.

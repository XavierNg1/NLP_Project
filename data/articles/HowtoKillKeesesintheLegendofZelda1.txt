 Keeses will only attack you once you get close to it. Once you get inside a dark room or dungeon, you’ll see these creatures hanging beside the walls or any structures in the area. Once you’re just a few steps away, Keeses will wake up and fly out to random directions.


In 2-D versions of the game (Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Link’s Awakening, Oracle of Season, and Oracle of Ages), these bats can only move up, down, left, or right across the screen.;
, Keeses can be taken down using any weapons you have, be it a bow and arrow or your Hook Shot. But the best offense you can use against these creatures is your sword. Equip the weapon of your choice on the Action button of your controller.
 Once these creatures comes near to where you are (or you to them), hack away with your sword or whatever weapon you currently have. Keeses can be brought down with only single blow or shot.

 If you want longer, thicker lashes, petroleum jelly can help condition them so they’re softer and less brittle. Use a clean spoolie to gently coat your lashes or rub a small amount over your lashes with your fingers before bed each night. You’ll wake up with healthy, soft lashes.If you don’t like mascara, you can apply the petroleum jelly during the day. Not only will it condition your lashes, it can also help define your lashes without adding any color.
 When you run out of your usual brow gel, petroleum jelly can help keep your brows in place all day. Dip a clean spoolie or brow brush in the jelly, and comb your brows into place.If you don’t have a spoolie or brush, rub a small amount of petroleum jelly over your brows to smooth them in place.
 If you’re tired of your usual matte eye shadows, petroleum jelly can help give them a shiny, almost wet look that’s sure to turn heads. Dab a light layer of the petroleum jelly over clean eyelids as a base, and use a small, dense eyeshadow brush to press the matte shadow over the jelly to give it a glossy sheen.Be sure to wipe off the brush on a tissue or towel if you have dip back into the shadow after it’s already touched the petroleum jelly on your lid. The petroleum jelly can leave a film on a pressed shadow that may ruin it.
 Waterproof mascara and eyeliner can be extremely difficult to remove. If you’ve washed your face and there’s still residue from your makeup, take a small amount of petroleum jelly on a cotton swab and run it along your lashline to remove the makeup.Petroleum jelly can also help remove eyelash glue. Rub it along your lashline, and you’ll be able to pull off your lashes with ease.

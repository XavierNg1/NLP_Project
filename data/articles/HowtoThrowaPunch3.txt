 Keep your chin down and your hands covering your face, like a boxer. Have your knees bent slightly so that they are balanced and your legs slightly more apart than usual.
 Shift your weight to your back foot. Twisting your hips generates power and makes your punch more devastating.
 The arm throwing the punch should be bent, not straight. There are a couple different variations to this punch:









The European hook: your thumb, if it were to be extended, should point in at you as your hook connects. You don't want to actually extend your thumb out as you punch; keep it in a fist. This is a good hook if there is a very short distance between you and your opponent.
The American hook: your thumb, if it were to be extended, should point up as your hook connects. Again, don't extend your thumb. This is a good hook if there is a lot of distance between you and your opponent.
The Mexican hook: the punch is thrown at a 45 degree angle instead of a completely horizontal angle. This is a blend of a hook and an uppercut.
 When you throw your hook, pop your elbow up as a defense mechanism.
 Really use your hips to follow through and remember to protect your face again after you land the punch.

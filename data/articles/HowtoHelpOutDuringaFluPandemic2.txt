 Another way you can help out during a flu pandemic is by properly caring for an infected friend or family member. If someone in your household is infected, it is best to designate a single person responsible for caring for him to minimize contact with the public.The designated caregiver should be especially vigilant about washing her hands, and should do so after each time she visits the infected person.
It is also a good idea for the caregiver to cover her mouth and nose when caring for the infected person.Invest in a surgical mask or other mouth-covering device, and replace it often.
 To the extent that it is possible, provide the infected person with a separate area of the home where others do not go to avoid the risk of infection.Keep the infected person at least three feet away from others.Keep this space aired out using natural breezes from open windows or doors, if it is not too cold outside., Having the flu causes a person to lose water at a faster rate than normal. It is important to keep an infected person hydrated, as dehydration can lead to serious health risks.Give the sick person as much water as he can drink.
Provide other liquids like juice or broth as well., Influenza can become severe and lead to other complications like pneumonia. In such cases, the illness can cause death. Watch for the following danger signs, and if you notice these, seek medical attention:Difficulty breathing
Severe chest pain
Inability to stand
Passing out or other sudden loss of consciousness
High fever for more than three days

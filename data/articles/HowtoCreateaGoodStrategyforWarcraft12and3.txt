 Orc, night elf, the undead, and human, all of them have different special abilities;


Orc: The peons can hide in the burrows and use it as a defensive building.
Night elf: Can harvest wood without harming the trees and the buildings can uproot to defend themselves.
Undead: The graveyard provides corpses that are good for necromancers and ghouls, also one builder can create an entire base in under 20 secs {Not including the time it takes to actually build it}.
Humans: Workers can help each other build a structure unlike all the other races.;
, Have workers harvesting wood and gold and have a few houses ready so you can start building up forces.
 (Are they going to rush or are they going to defend and counter?) After a while of building up forces, you can either attack or wait.
 You can do many different attacks, but most people just do 3 types of attacks the most:

, Get all the units close to base and attack from the front or send in the forces one by one whenever a previous force was sent and they now need help. This is in case your enemy has a way out of the attack, like using zeppelins.


Create a bunch of melee, then create a bunch of ranged units and try to get more range than melee. Once you've done this, you can attack. Set up the ranged outside of the base. This way, they can stop any zeppelins from getting away. Get the melee and the heroes to attack the base. If you can, get a few tanks(Units with siege type attacks or heavy attacks). send in more units if needed.

 The formula is S=n(n+1)2{\displaystyle S={\frac {n(n+1)}{2}}}, where s{\displaystyle s} equals the sum of all the numbers in the series, and n{\displaystyle n} equals the number of terms (numbers) in the series., Since the series begins with 1, the number of terms is equal to the last term in the series. Plug in this value for n{\displaystyle n}.

For example, if you are finding the sum of consecutive numbers 1 through 25, you have 25 numbers in your sequence, so n=25{\displaystyle n=25}, and your formula will look like this: S=25(25+1)2{\displaystyle S={\frac {25(25+1)}{2}}}.
 First add the numbers in parentheses. Then, multiply their sum by n{\displaystyle n}. Finally, divide the product by 2. The result is the sum of the numbers in the series.

For example:S=25(26)2{\displaystyle S={\frac {25(26)}{2}}}S=6502{\displaystyle S={\frac {650}{2}}}S=325{\displaystyle S=325}


, This will give you the average of the series. For example, 32525=13{\displaystyle {\frac {325}{25}}=13}. So, the average of the series 1-25 is 13.

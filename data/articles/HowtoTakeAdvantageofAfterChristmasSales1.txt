 As with any sales, after Christmas sales can get competitive. While after Christmas sales are not as intense as sales on Black Friday, you still want to hit the stores early for the best deals. Try to get to the stores some time on the 26th to beat the rush and snag the best deals., If you're buying things you don't really need, you may not really save money. You may end up stocking up on items you do not really need just because they're on sale. Before you hit the stores, make a list of items you hope to find on sale.Write down things you could really use, such as household products or new clothing. When shopping, prioritize items on your list over impulse buys to maximize savings.
 Know how much an item normally costs before snagging a deal. If the average price for, say, a fitness watch is $100, a $94 watch does not save you too much money. Make sure you know the normal prices of items you want before heading out shopping so you can identify the best deals.You should also research brands ahead of time. A very marked down television set may not be the best bargain if the brand has a bad reputation. You may save more money over time paying a little more for a marked down name brand television.
 See if you have any coupons. If coupons do not indicate they can only be used on products that have not been marked down, bring them in with you during after Christmas sales. You may be able to get an extra percentage off an already marked down item., Look for sales ahead of time in your local paper. You may even find coupons in the paper that are good at after Christmas sales. You can also look on your favorite stores' websites to see if they are having any after Christmas sales.
 If you have any gift cards, you can make them last longer by using them at an after Christmas sale. You can also return any items you received that you did not want at an after Christmas sale. During Christmas sales, try to use the gifts you received to your advantage.

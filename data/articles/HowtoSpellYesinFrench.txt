, Just as in English, the French have a slang variant for yes. It is spelled "ouais". It means yeah or yep.
", as in "wow!". If your yes is meant to be exclamatory, as in you're excited about something, use the word "ouah", spelt just like that.

, The word is "si". This is used when rebutting a negative question or emphasizing your yes in response to a negative statement. For example:


Tu n'aimes pas mon livre ? (Don't you like my book?)
Si, je l'aime beaucoup ! (Of course, I like it a lot!)
Elle est jamais à l'heure. (She is never on time.)
Si, si ! (Yes she is!)

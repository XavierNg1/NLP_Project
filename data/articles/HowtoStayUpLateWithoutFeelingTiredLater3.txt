 If possible, take a catnap in the early afternoon after a night of staying up late. Set an alarm to make sure that you don’t sleep more than 20-25 minutes, which is the ideal amount of time to refresh you without leaving you feeling groggy or breaking up your day. If you are at work or school and can’t find a quiet place to rest, try to at least put your head down for a few minutes, or nap in your car if you drove in., If you are running on minimal sleep, try getting outdoors to boost your energy level and mood. Sunlight increases your vitamin D level, which will help you feel happier and more alert. Getting some sun will also pump up your immune system, which may be slightly compromised after a late night and missed sleep.Get as much sunlight as your day will permit, even if it means taking a quick walk around the outside of the building or parking lot.
 To refresh yourself after a late night with little sleep, get some light exercise. Exercise increases energy levels and adrenaline by improving circulation. It will also rev up your metabolism, which will contribute to you feeling good overall.For a quick workout, take a brisk walk or jog up and down the stairs.

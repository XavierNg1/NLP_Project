 One of the most telling factors about the quality of instruction your child would receive is the level of experience of the camp’s instructors. If information about instructors’ experience isn’t clearly advertised on a camp’s website, ask them about the qualifications of their instructors over the phone or through an email.As least some, if not all, of the instructors at an immersive language camp should be native speakers of the language your child will be studying.
 One of the main benefits of “immersive” language camps are the opportunities that many camps offer outside of the traditional teaching environment. Some camps do a great job of getting kids out of the classroom and into environments where the language they are learning is regularly used.Examples of specific activities will vary for students of different ages, but can include taking field trips, going on tours, eating out, and attending popular entertainment off of the camp’s grounds.
 Language immersion camps of various types exist for children from the ages of 18 months to 18 years. Some camps welcome children of widely varied ages, while other specialize in working with children of a certain age. It’s often to best to opt for camps that specialize in teaching children that are your child’s age.Given the choice between a camp that has kids from 1st to 8th grade, and a camp that specializes in teaching kids from 1st through 3rd grade, the latter will likely provide a more focused environment for your child.

 As you create and put the new cover on you may want to to consult the "photographic memory" compiled from before the couch was taken apart, or to ask for advice from a more experienced person.
 Find a large flat area (a large table or the floor) to roll out and cut your fabric. Use the old cover as a pattern to cut the fabric. Lay the old cover pieces on the new fabric, rearranging the pieces on top of the fabric as necessary to save fabric.









On seamed edges cut 1/2" from the old seam.
On stapled edges add 2-3" more, which will be used to pull the fabric cover onto the sofa.
 Older heavy duty metal sewing machines work better and hold up longer than the new lightweight plastic machines. Use the zipper foot to sew along the welting edges. Use heavy duty thread and a heavy needle to sew the fabric. Use a 1/2" seam allowance.
 If you don't have one, purchase a good-quality staple gun, and go to town.
 First attach the sofa deck, then the inside arms, and the inside back, in that order. No matter which way you are attaching the fabric, be sure to pull the fabric snug as you attach it, or it will stretch over time.









When the inside is attached, fit and sew the cushion(s). If the cushions are a little too big or too small, you can adjust the size of the cushion area by loosening or tightening the bottom of the inside arms and inside back. Then attach the outside arms and the outside back.
 Perhaps the most important thing to do is show it off.

 Those with a glossy finish might look nicer indoors, but they'll reflect the sun all too well if you take them outside. Matte-screen laptops are few and far between these days, but you may have luck finding a used or refurbished model.
 Now that glossy screens outnumber the matte, your options may appear limited. But not all screens are created equal—even some glossy screens have design enhancements that make them perform well in the sun. When deciding between different glossy-screened laptops, look for keywords in the advertisements/descriptions like “Outdoor View,” “I/O,” “Indoor/Outdoor,” or “Enhanced Outdoor.”

, Some laptops with outdoor-friendly screens also have other features beneficial for outdoor use, such as a thick chassis that protects your laptop if it drops. These laptops nearly always have the word “rugged” or “outdoor” in their product names. Some of these laptops are even waterproof. Search online for reviews of these models, or drop by your local computer store to ask for recommendations.

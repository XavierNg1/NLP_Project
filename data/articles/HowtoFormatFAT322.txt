, You can format any drive up to 2 TB in size using this tool.


The larger the drive, the longer Windows will take to recognize and mount the drive when it's been inserted. A 2 TB drive may take ten or more seconds to appear in Windows after being plugged in.
 You'll be prompted by Windows to give administrator access to the program. It doesn't need to be installed, and will run immediately.
 You'll see the capacity and the current format of the drive.
 You can enter any label for the drive. This is the name that will appear when it is inserted in a computer or other device.
 The time the format process takes will depend on the size of the drive.
 Once the format is complete, you should be able to find your drive in your Computer/This PC window. Note that the drive may not appear immediately, especially if it is larger than 1 TB.


If the devices and computers you plan to use your drive with support exFAT or NTFS, you should use one of those formats instead. You'll get faster transfer speeds and support for larger file sizes. FAT32 for drives larger than 32 GB is only recommended if your devices only support the FAT32 format.

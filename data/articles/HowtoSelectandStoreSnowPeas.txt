 The green should be bright and the seeds very small and flat., Good snow peas should snap when broken in half.
 The ideal length for a snow pea is approximately 7.5cm/3" in length and about 2cm/3/4" across.
 Avoid snow peas with wilted, discoloured or shrivelled parts.
 Allow them to dry on a wire rack and place in a paper bag for storage.
 Kept this way, they should last for up to three weeks.

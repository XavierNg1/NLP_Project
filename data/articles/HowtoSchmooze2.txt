 The more similar a person thinks they are to you, the more engaged they will be in the conversation. Try to draw parallels between the person you're talking to.For example, if someone says "This customer blamed me because their order didn't arrive, but it was the shipping company's fault," you can say something like, "Yeah, customers sometimes complain about things outside of my control too."

, You don't want to talk too much when you're schmoozing. Make sure that you give the person you're talking to enough space in the conversation to say things. A great way to do this is by asking questions that require a response. Think of the conversation as a series of opportunities to expand your relationship and don't obsess over saying the wrong thing.For example, if someone is talking about a recent baseball game, you can say, "What do you think of the Mets performance so far this season?"
If you're talking about a movie you've both seen recently you could say something like, "Yeah, Eli Roth's directing has really evolved over the last ten years. What's your favorite movie of his?"

, Don't just come out and say something like "You're the best!" Instead, frame your compliment as a question or statement. For example, you could say something like "How did you keep such a cool head yesterday with that customer?" or "I wasn't sure about your techniques at first, but now I see it's really the best way to do it."You can also compliment them by saying something like "I don't want to embarrass you, but your explanation of the classical dynamics of spinning tops is one of the best I've ever heard."

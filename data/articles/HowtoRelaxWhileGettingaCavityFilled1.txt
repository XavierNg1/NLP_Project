 Listening to music or a funny audiobook before and while you’re getting a cavity filled can help you relax. Consider what best relaxes or distracts you, whether it’s loud, heavy music or something more calming. Make a playlist and show up to your appointment with a good set of headphones that’ll drown out any sounds from the dentist’s tools.Talk to your dentist in advance to make sure wearing headphones, especially a bulkier set, won’t interfere with their work.
Make sure that the volume is not too high so that you will still be able to hear the dentist’s instructions for you.;
, Showing up more than five or ten minutes early might make you more nervous. While it’s always good to show up on time or a little early to appointments, you don’t want to have to sit in the waiting room for a while anticipating the procedure. If you do arrive to the office too early, wait in your car or outside until a few minutes before your appointment, since waiting rooms themselves can be a source of anxiety.The sound of the drill turbine can provoke anxiety in some people, so try to avoid hearing it if possible.
 Talk to your dentist in advance about whether or not you can eat before the procedure. If you’ve already made arrangements for a general anesthetic, or a sedative that makes you unconscious, you may not be able to eat after midnight the night before.In addition, go to the bathroom before your appointment. It’s a lot easier to relax while sitting in the dentist’s chair for a while if you don’t have to use the restroom!

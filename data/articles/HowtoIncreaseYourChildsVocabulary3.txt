 When you speak to your child, talk to them as if you are speaking with another adult. There is no need to “dumb down” your speech so your child understands. Encourage your child to ask a question if they do not understand something that was said.Children who engage in or listen to higher level conversations have better vocabularies and better reading skills later in life.
Use a more advanced word when possible. For example, instead of “happy,” you may use “jovial” or “ecstatic.”

, It is easier to learn a new word if it is related to a word your child already knows. For example, if your child already knows the word “vegetable” and “carrot,” it can help them learn the word “broccoli.” If your child knows the word “mad,” it will help them learn the word “upset.”You can also teach words that are related to a similar concept. If you are discussing farms, you may talk about all the different things that relate to farms. This way your child will understand that association between these words and will be more likely to remember them.
 Repetition is important when learning new words. Use the word on multiple occasions and in different scenarios. It is better to focus on a few words instead of trying to introduce a bunch of new words.Your child will understand a word before they are able to actually use them.
 Your child will learn best if you cater to their learning style. Your child may learn best by listening, doing, or seeing. Try different methods to see what works best.If your child learns by listening, introduce new words through conversations. Talk about what words mean. You may even use rhymes or riddles to learn.
If tour child learns best by doing, have them act out words using facial expressions and gestures.
If your child learns best by seeing, use objects and drawings to learn words and their meaning.

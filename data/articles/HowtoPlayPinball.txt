 The machine usually accepts quarters or dollar bills. Some accept credits by swiping a card, depending on the location the game is at. Games are generally 50 cents a play, but if you insert more than 2 quarters consecutively you can get a slight discount per credit. Usually the pattern is 1 credit on the second quarter, 2 on the third, and 3 on the fourth quarter, also known as "3 games for a dollar." Some newer games, depending on the owner of the game, will cost 75 cents, 1 dollar, or sometimes more to play.;
, Press the start button to begin the game. If you have more than one credit on the machine, you can play with a friend by pressing the start button a second time. You can play with up to 5 friends on some games.
 Depending on the game, there are different ways you can launch the ball onto the playfield. There is a lane to the far right of the playfield called the shooter lane. When a game is started your first ball is placed in the shooter lane, ready to launch. Either pull back and release the plunger or press the launch button. Some machines use different styles of launch buttons including gun handles, door knockers, etc. depending on the theme.
 There are buttons on the side of the game. These are the flipper buttons, pressing these will flip the flippers on the corresponding side of the playfield. Some games have more flippers than the standard 2 at the bottom.
 The basic goal of pinball is to keep the ball on the playfield and use the flippers to aim for targets and score points. There are dividers above each lower flipper. If the ball comes down the inner side of a divider, it enters the return lane and comes back to the flipper. If it falls in the outer lane, known as the outlane, the ball is lost and your next ball begins (unless that was your last ball). You also "drain" if a ball slips between the flippers. You usually get 3 balls per game.

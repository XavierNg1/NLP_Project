 Wrap the yarn around the crochet hook into the form of a magic circle. Work two chain stitches over the edge of the circle.


This pattern calls for a size B/1 (2.25 mm) hook and lace to super fine yarn, but you can experiment with different hooks and yarn weights to alter the size of the bow.
 Work six double crochet into the center of the magic circle.


These double crochet will form one side of the bow.
 Work three chain stitches, then slip stitch once into the center of the ring.


The connecting chain will help separate the two sides from one another, making them distinct and preventing them from running together.
 Create another bow side and another connecting chain following the same pattern used for the first set.


To complete the second side of the bow, chain two and work six double crochet into the center of the magic ring.
To complete the second connecting chain, chain three and slip stitch the last chain into the center of the magic ring.
 Carefully pull the ending tail of yarn, tightening the center of the magic ring in the process.


Note that you may need to hold the starting tail steady to cinch the center closed.
Continue tightening the center until the ring seems as tight as possible. Stop before the two sides of the bow can fold in on one another, though.
 Cut the yarn, leaving 6 inches (15 cm) of excess. Pull this excess tail through the last loop on the hook to fasten it off.
 Wrap the remaining tail around the center of the bow several times to define the shape. When you're satisfied with how it looks, knot the tail at the back of the bow.


Weave the starting tail and the remaining end tail into the back side of the stitches using a yarn needle.

 When you are done cooking, power down and unplug your grill. Allow it to cool completely before handling any surface.
 Most electric grills have a small cup that catches all the juices and grease produced during grilling. This cup should be cleaned after every use.


Remove the cup as per your grill instructions. Empty the contents in the trash.
Wash the grease trap either in the dishwasher (if it is dishwasher safe) or by hand with warm soap and water.
 Use a paper towel to wipe down any excess grease or food. Some models have removable grilling plates. These plates can be washed either in the dishwasher or by hand with warm soap and water.


Consult your model's operation manual for all features and follow written instructions.
Do not submerge the entire grill in water. This is an electrical device containing elements that can be damaged in water.
 If your model does not have removable grill plates, use a soapy sponge to clean the grill plates. Be careful not to use an overly-abrasive scrubber as this can damage the grill's non-stick surface.
 Follow the sponge wash with a damp dishrag to remove any greasy residue and to wash away any trace of soap. Finish by drying the grill plates with a dry paper towel.
 Use a sponge with a couple drops of dish soap to degrease the outside of the grill. Grease often splatters and accumulates on the upper and lowers lips of the grill, so it is recommended that you clean these areas after every use.


Follow all written instructions for the proper care and storage of your electric grill.

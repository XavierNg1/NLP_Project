 The key to having a good online presence is to post on your social media an appropriate amount of times. If you never post, you will have no online presence. Posting too much might hurt your online presence and make you lose followers. Typically, the “maximum” number of posts are: Twitter three times a day, Instagram one time a day, Facebook one or two times a day, and a blog two times per week., There are many tools available online, such as Buffer, to help you manage all your social media in one place. Put your social media on a dashboard to make managing your online presence easier. Using a single platform saves you time and energy when managing your online reputation., You can use online platforms to schedule social media posts. Scheduling posts allows you to stay active on social media, even if you are actually not paying attention to it. You can even think of a month's worth of posts in one sitting and schedule them to post throughout the month. You can also use scheduling to post at prime times of the day, so if you think of something you want to post in the middle of the night, you can set it to post the following morning.

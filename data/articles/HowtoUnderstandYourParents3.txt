 Empathy is a hard skill to learn, but it is rewarding because it allows you to gain a deeper understanding of other people. Here are some ways to cultivate empathy:


Listen to what you parents are saying. Try to imagine what they are feeling and "put yourself in their shoes."
Ask questions. This will make you more engaged in the conversation and let your parents know that you are listening.
Make yourself vulnerable. If applicable, share your own experiences with your parents. Open up to them., The PEN method — Pause, Empathy, Need — is good for having difficult conversations with your parents. If you feel yourself becoming upset with your parents, first you should pause. Don't say anything you will regret later. Then, empathize with your parents. Think about how they feel: if you were in their shoes, what would you be thinking and feeling? Next, express your needs to your parents. Say that you want to understand their perspectives, but you also have your own needs that you must express. Communicate calmly with your parents if you're having a difficult conversation.


Try saying, "I understand that you are worried about my safety when I stay out late, but it's important to me to socialize and go out with my friends."

, Rather than focusing on what your parents could do better to improve your relationship, focus on what you can do. Could you help with the dishes or call a little more often? Brainstorm ways to get along with your parents that will also help you to understand them.For example, you could offer to cook dinner for your parents, or plan a hiking day with them. Take care of all of the logistics.
Help with the housework, or offer to do them a favor around the house. Ask if their fence needs painting or the family dog needs walking.

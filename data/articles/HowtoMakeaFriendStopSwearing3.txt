 There are people and situations that can trigger the use of profanity. Long lines, traffic jams, people they dislike, and people or things that also use profanity in a casual manner can trigger the behavior. Once they become aware of these triggers, they will be able to control their behavior better.You can ask them, “What triggered you to use that word?”
Help them eliminate music, movies, or TV shows that use excessive profanity.
 Pent up anger can also cause your friend to use profanity excessively. Help your friend divert their anger by advising them to use breathing techniques whenever they feel the urge to express their frustration with profanity.Tell your friend, “Every time you feel like using a curse word, instead of saying the word, use a breathing technique. Close your eyes and slowly inhale. Hold it for a few seconds, and then exhale. Let the moment pass you by.”
Exercise can also relieve pent up anger and frustration. Offer to go biking or running in the park whenever your friend expresses anger and frustration.
 Curb their use of curse words by helping them find healthy substitutes. You can either help them expand their vocabulary, or offer more benign substitutes for the curse word.Help them look up substitute words in the dictionary that more accurately describe how they are feeling.
Help them come up with substitute phrases. For example, tell them to say, “Oh shitake mushrooms,” instead of “Oh s***t.”

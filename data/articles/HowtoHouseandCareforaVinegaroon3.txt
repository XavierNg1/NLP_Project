 Be sure to switch out the wet towel every couple of days to prevent mold growth. Mold can kill your Vinegaroon., When feeding your Vinnie you can use a wide variety of invertebrates. Always make sure that the prey offered cannot overtake the Vinegaroon. They can take down good sized prey, but better be safe than sorry. Good invertebrates include:

Crickets
Cockroaches
Slugs
Snails
Waxworms
Superworms
and more.
 You can give one random night a week off where you don't feed. This helps to give your Vinegaroon a night off., Any bug spray can kill your pet., Be sure to keep the waste left behind by your Vinnie cleaned up each week. They don't defecate all that much., Keep a supply of water handy. Distilled or R.O. water is always best. And a time or two each week you should mist the enclosure to help add a little humidity and aid your pet with molting.

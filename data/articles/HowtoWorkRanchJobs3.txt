 A lot of ranch work involves heavy lifting and physical work. Lifting bales of straw, wrestling livestock, and stretching wire all require a significant amount of strength. Exercise and workout regularly.


Do strength training. Lift weights or simply work your muscles by using your own body. Strengthen your arms and legs with daily push-ups and squats.
 If it rains, you work. If it snows, you work. If the sun is blisteringly hot, you work. If a heifer has a calf at two in the morning, you work. Ranch work happens all around the clock, so be prepared to face the elements.
 Protecting yourself against rough nature is important. Wear jeans, work boots, a long-sleeved shirt, a hat, and gloves in order to adequately protect your skin. A heavy work coat will be necessary in colder temperatures.


Use sunscreen. If you work outdoors all day, your skin will need protection. Wear sunscreen regularly to avoid sunburn and other dangerous skin conditions.

 Mix the flour, eggs, and cold water. Make sure you put an equal amount of all three of the ingredients. Too much water could make the batter too runny, and too much flour could make the batter too thick. For a single roll, one egg, half a cup of cold water, and a cup of flour should work just fine.;
, In order to do this you must put enough oil into a pan to submerge the shrimp.


Heat the pan to approximately 350 degrees and batter up your shrimp until your heart’s content.
Dunk the shrimp into the oil, they’ll be finished when the oil bubbles start to shrink.
 Bring out your cutting board, plastic wrap, and your nori which is otherwise known as seaweed paper. Split the nori into two pieces and lay it on the plastic wrap which goes on top of the cutting board. Lather the nori in rice until there’s a nice thin layer covering it and leave an inch long strip on the top uncovered, then flip the nori and rice so the nori is on top.
 Take the plastic wrap and use it to roll the sushi. Grab it from both ends and wrap the end with rice over the inch that doesn’t have any rice on it. Apply pressure and you’ll have your roll! You can now cut it into pieces and enjoy.

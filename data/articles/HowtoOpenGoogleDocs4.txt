If you’re using a mobile device, you should also install the Google Docs app. iPhone and iPad users can get it from the App Store. On Android, grab it from the Play Store.

In the mobile app, tap the “+” icon.



Mobile users, tap “New Document” instead.
Google Docs files save automatically, so there’s no need to press Save when you’re done.

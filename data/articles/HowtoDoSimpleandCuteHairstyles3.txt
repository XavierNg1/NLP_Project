 A chignon is a classic hairstyle that can be thought of as a cross between a ponytail and a bun. Make sure you have two large and four small bobby pins on hand if you decide to go with this style.
 Take your gathered up hair with one hand and twist it in a clockwise direction by rolling your wrist. Be gentle to avoid hair breakage or hurting your scalp. Keep twisting until all of your hair from the nape of your neck to the tips is a tight spiral., Hold your hair with one hand, maintaining its twisted spiral. With that same hand, begin to wrap the whole strand in a clockwise circle around its base. Place your index finger of your other hand in the center of the base to keep the bun in shape. Once you've gotten down to the end of your hair, wrap the tips underneath the rest of the bun.You can also do a counterclockwise chignon. If you choose this option, start by twisting your hair counterclockwise instead in Step 2.
 Use large bobby pins on either side to hold your bun securely. Make any minor changes to your bun's shape you'd like by gently pulling edges loose with your fingers. Once you have the desired shape, pin it in place with the four smaller bobby pins.


You may choose to put the finishing touches on your chignon by adding a little volume to your hairdo. Use the tail of a comb and gently slide it under the hair at your crown. Gently pull the hair slightly up and out of the bun. You can use the same technique on the outer portion of the bun.

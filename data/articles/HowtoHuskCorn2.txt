 Put your corn (husk and all) inside your microwave. Set the power to “high” and cook for two minutes. When the timer ends, turn the ear of corn over and repeat.The kernels inside should be steaming through the husk by the end. If they aren’t, keep cooking for shorter intervals until the kernels are sufficiently heated.
 Remember: the ear should be pretty hot at this point, so use a pot holder, kitchen towel, or other safe means to remove it from the microwave. Set it on a cutting board. Slice off the bottom of the ear.You want about a ¼- to a ½-inch (0.6 to 1.2 cm) of the ear’s kernels exposed after slicing off the bottom. If slicing the bottom off didn’t accomplish that on its own, use a knife to pry the leaves loose along your cut.
 Hold the ear over the cutting board (or, if you’re worried about it rolling off that, use a large bowl instead). Grip it by its top. Start squeezing the ear inside down along the husk so that it comes out of the opened bottom.The corn’s silk should stay inside the husk as the ear itself comes out, but give the kernels a check anyway and peel away any strands that might have stuck.

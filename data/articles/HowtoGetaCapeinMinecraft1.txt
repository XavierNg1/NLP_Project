 There is no way for you to get a cape in the game, at least officially. You can use mods to add capes to the game (see the section below), but these will only be visible to you when you play online. If you want a cape that everyone can see, you'll need to go to an official Minecraft event like MineCon.MineCon is typically held in November, though it took place in July in 2015. 2016 dates have now been announced to be occurring on September 24-25, check mojang.com for more announcements.
Other than being heavily involved in the development or community, this is the only way to obtain an official cape.;
, When you actually visit MineCon, you'll be able to register with your Minecraft account. By registering your Minecraft account, you'll receive a redemption code via email that will give your account a cape.
 Follow the link in the email that you receive to add the cape to your Minecraft account. When you're wearing it, anyone you're playing multiplayer with will be able to see it.
 Besides MineCon capes, the only other players to receive capes have been a select few that have been heavily involved with the development and community aspects of Minecraft. These include a handful of translators, bug fixers, and the occasional lucky user. This requires a lot of time and hard work, so you probably shouldn't undertake translation projects just to try to get a cape.
 It's impossible to earn many of the capes that you may have seen anymore, so try not to worry too much about not having one. If you really need a cape while you play, you can try a cape mod.
 if you managed to get a cape, or even more than one, you can change them from your Minecraft Profile page. Visit minecraft.net/profile and log in with your Minecraft account. You'll be able to select from any of your available capes.

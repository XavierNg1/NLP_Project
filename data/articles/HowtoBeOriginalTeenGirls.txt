 You are like nobody else. If you follow the mainstream, then tone it down. If everyone is listening and talking about a certain type of music, you must talk about other music. It will interest people.;
, Did you hear a cool new song in an ipod commercial? Look up the song's name and tell your friends about it. Did you notice a small, unknown store that sells awesome clothes for low prices? Next time you hang out with your friends, mention the store and stop by it. People will want to listen to you if they know they can hear something interesting and new each time!

, If you can't make jokes, appreciate other people's jokes and learn to laugh at yourself. If you are to touchy and sensitive, people might avoid being themselves around you so that they don't upset you. Remember, you don't have to spend hours looking up "yo mama" jokes on the internet: you can take a few funny things that actually happened to you and relate it to your friends.
 For example, you could dye your hair pure white and wear purple contacts. Or wear DIY t-shirts.
 People will avoid you if every time you talk they get a migraine or if they have to strain to hear you.
 Don't use slang language because it comes across as childish.
 If you are a pleasant person, people will appreciate how fun you are to be around.
 When you talk, show your hands. It shows that you're open to conversation. Don't hide them in your pockets or cross them across your chest.
,, Sure, the new in Color lip gloss is cool, and the lead singer of My Chemical Romance is hot, but it doesn't mean you have to "always" talk about this. Some people won't be interested in those subjects. Talk about everything you like, and a wider range of people will want to listen.
 You don't have to be devastatingly gorgeous, but wash and comb your hair, brush your teeth and wear clean, crisp clothes. It will make you feel more confident and, subconsciously, people will want to be around you.

 Tablature is a visual guide that will teach you how to play notes of songs if you don't know how to read music. Since many people don't know how to read music, tablature is becoming increasingly popular.
 As boring as they sound, scales are actually very important in the development of serious musicians. Learning scales will help you practice your fingering, improve your speed and agility, as well as help you to solo/improvise.
 A solo is when a musician sets off on their own and plays a musical passage that's distinct, varied, and sometimes improvised. Soloing can be hard, but it's also rewarding.
 When you get to the point of starting to be bored playing other people's music, it may be time to create your own. Composing your own music takes a lot of time, practice, and false starts, but having your own song is like nothing else in the world.
 Some of these techniques include sweep picking (with fingers or with a pick, it's harder with fingers), tapping, tremolo picking (again, harder with hands than with a pick) and slapping/popping.
 If you are at this point, it means that you really like what you are doing. You may be bored with always tuning and detuning your bass, so having 2 or three can save you some time.

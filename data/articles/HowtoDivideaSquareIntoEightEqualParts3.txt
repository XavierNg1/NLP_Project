 Make sure it is actually a square: it should have four sides of equal length, with adjacent sides that are mutually perpendicular to one another.


As an example, say you have a square with sides measuring 4m.
 Before you can divide the square evenly, you need to find ∆l – the length that will divide a side of the square into four equal parts. To do that, divide the length by 4.


In the example above, you would divide 4m by 4 to get 1m.
 Once you know what the length of your segments should be, draw three vertical lines in regular increments of that length. You will now have four equal rectangles.


In the example above, you would draw three vertical lines, spaced 1m apart.
 Because all the sides of a square are equal, you know how to divide all sides equally. Once you have four rectangles, you can simply draw one horizontal line through the center of the square, dividing it into eight equal rectangles.


In the example above, you would draw a horizontal line from the 2m mark of the left side to the 2m mark of the right side to get eight equal rectangles.

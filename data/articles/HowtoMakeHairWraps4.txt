 Take thread behind, hold it into a 4 with your hand and pulled of thread through like a knot. Then pull it all the way up to your scalp or the top to the braid., After about 10-15 times of doing this same 4 tie knot, the wrap will be about an inch down the braid and you will start to see how the pattern is going around and around your braid., To make the pattern flow, when you are tying it, you will pull it in a circle for each new knot. Don't pull it too tight, just a light tug up, so that it is easy enough to get out of your hair when you are ready to remove the hair wrap., To finish the wrap, pull the current thread through the loop of the final wrap to make a knot. Double it with the other threads to make the knot extra secure. Trim any excess thread from the bottom.

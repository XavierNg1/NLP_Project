 If you see your dog with something inedible in its mouth, the ‘drop it’ command will train your dog to drop that object. This is especially important if your dog has something sharp, like a rock or stick, in its mouth that could cause major damage to its GI tract. To help your dog learn this command:Practice the command in a quiet area.
Give your dog a toy to play with.
Give the ‘drop it’ command and a hold a treat in front of your dog’s nose. When your dog drops the toy, immediately reward it with a treat.
To increase the difficulty, practice the command in a place with more distractions, such as a dog park.
 When your dog drops what’s in its mouth, it should leave the object on the ground and come to you. That way, your dog won’t be tempted to put the pica object right back in its mouth. Also, if you see your dog approaching something inedible, calling your dog to you will prevent it from eating that object. Follow some helpful tips when teaching this command:Reward your dog with a treat and verbal praise each time it comes when called.
Have your dog sit before it receives its reward.
 As with any type of dog training, teaching your dog the “drop it” and “come” commands will take daily practice. Keep the training sessions short (10-15 minutes) to keep your dog from getting bored. If your schedule allows, have multiple training sessions in a day until your dog learns the commands.End training sessions on a happy note, with lots of praise (petting, verbal praise).Pica can be a problem in puppies as well. If your puppy develops pica, try teaching the “leave it” command and find ways to distract your puppy from non-food items that he wants to eat, such as by offering a favorite toy instead.

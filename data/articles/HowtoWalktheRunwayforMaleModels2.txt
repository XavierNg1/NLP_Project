 Hold your shoulders back and keep them still, but not to the extreme that you seem robotic. Just try not to let them bounce up and down as you walk. In addition, keep your chest out and stomach in, so you appear broader and taller, which will emphasize your masculinity., Without letting them touch your sides, try to keep your arms close to your torso. That way, your lower arms will sway freely and naturally without swinging too wildly. Further, keep your hands and fingers relaxed, and don’t ball your hands or hold them in fists.Try to keep your fingers naturally straight without overextending them. That way, you won’t look like you’re missing any fingers in photographs.
 Find a focal point directly ahead and lock your eyes on it. Don’t shift your eyes around or look down at your feet. Your head should point slightly downward with your chin roughly parallel with the floor.Depending on your designer’s instructions, you can look away from your focal point to make eye contact with the audience during your pose.
 Unless your designer tells you to, don’t smile during your walk. Without locking or pursing them, keep your lips closed, relaxed, and natural. While your facial expression should be neutral, it should still convey confidence., Confidence is key on the runway. As you walk, try thinking about how great you look. Tell yourself you’re the best looking person in the room and your posture and facial expression will reflect it.

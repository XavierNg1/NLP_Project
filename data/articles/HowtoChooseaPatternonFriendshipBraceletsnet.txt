,,, If you want to make a normal bracelet, stay on the same page.
 You can adjust this by looking at the left hand side.


Click the "Patterns with Photos" button if you only want patterns with photos so you know what the bracelet will look like.
 Do you like super colourful patterns or a simple bracelet? The difficulty is listed on the far right hand side of the chart. This can help you choose which bracelet you may want to start with.
 When you click on it, it will show you the pattern, how many rows it is (except Kumihimo bracelets), how many colours, the difficulty, etc.


Near the bottom of the page, in the middle, it shows similar patterns to the one you are looking at and photos.
 If you like flowers, patterns with the key word 'flower' in it will appear.

 Separate out the stems and seeds if necessary, and use a grinder or chop up the buds with a sharp knife until they're finely chopped, but not completely powdered.
 Place the ingredients in a blender and blend until completely smooth.
 This gives the flavors a chance to meld., Monitor the pan carefully to make sure it doesn't begin to boil or evaporate away. Add more water if necessary to keep the level of liquid constant.
 Steep the teabag for five minutes. During this time the tea will begin to cool.
 Place the sieve (or a piece of cheesecloth) over a bowl and pour the tea through to remove the tiny pieces of bud. You can skip this step if you don't mind their texture.
 Stir in sugar and more milk to taste. For an extra-indulgent drink, add a dollop of whipped cream topped with a sprinkling of cinnamon.


Note: Even with only a 1/2 gram, this tea will create a strong high.

 You can hire a car from many places in Manila that will take you to Tagaytay. The private cars that can take you to Tagaytay often gather near the airport, though, so it is easiest from there., Taxis from the airport have regulated rates that make them more expensive than other options. A private car or an FX (a taxi-like van), hired just outside of the airport, will be a more economical option., You should be able to hire an FX for about $35 in US dollars. Don't be afraid to haggle over the price. For $35 you should at least be able to get to Tagaytay, and maybe hire a driver for the whole day.It is not uncommon for drivers to ask you to pay for fuel. This should come to no more than 1,000 Pesos.

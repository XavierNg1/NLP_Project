 You can help attract birds to your garden and encourage them to stay and nest by hanging up nest boxes. Nest boxes can be purchased at local pet supply stores. These boxes come in multiple different varieties and some boxes are more suitable to nesting than others. Take these tips into consideration when shopping for a nest box for your garden:Choose a box made with insulating material. Look for a nest box made from thick wood (15-19mm thick) such as cedar, oak, or beech. Thinner woods, such as pine will not last as long. A nest box made out of ceramic will likely be too hot or too cold for chicks to survive.
Choose a box that is the right size for the bird you want to attract. Different birds will need different sized nest boxes.Do not get a box with a perch. Perches are not necessary for nest boxes and can actually provide a way for predators such as squirrels, cats, and weasels to access eggs and chicks living in the nest box.You can also make your own nesting box.
 Nest boxes should be hung up early in the spring before birds begin to nest. It is very important that you choose a safe location so that birds will feel safe and remain nesting in your garden each year. Situate your nest box at least 3 meters off the ground and in an area that is sheltered from the weather.Make sure that nest boxes are not positioned too close to bird feeders or other nest boxes because this may lead to competition, and too much activity in the area could disrupt a nesting pair.
Clean out the nest box once a year to encourage occupancy., Help birds with nest-making by putting out materials they can use to build their nests. You can purchase nesting materials such as wool and string or you can gather your own nesting material and place it in the garden for the birds. For example, you can provide birds with pet hair, lint, or grass clippings. Just place the materials into the hollow of a tree or attach them to a pile of twigs.

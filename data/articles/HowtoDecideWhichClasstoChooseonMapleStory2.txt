Bowmen can use ranged attacks, and hit very hard with them. Although useless in melee early on, their high damage capability at ranged makes up for it. They have unstable damage at first. They are very hard to jump-attack with.
Pros:

Damage starts to shine later in the game
Most range in the game
Most uncommon whole class in the game
Highest accuracy among all classes
Relatively cheap equips (especially for crossbowmen)
High knockback ability
Hurricane's (Bow Master skill) rivals Triple Throw (Night Lord with Shadow Partner (star thief))
Pierce (Marksman/XBow master skill) deals very, very high damage to mobs.
Marksmen get a skill that can one-hit KO any non-boss monster.
Arrow Eruption/Rain allows 3rd job Bowmen to mob up close.


Cons:

Mediocre HP, and MP
Unstable damage (fixed in 4th job, where you get 90% Mastery)
Use up close until you attain Power Knockback and Mortal Blow
Attack speed is slower than that of their star counterpart (especially crossbowmen)
Movement and jumpshooting is tougher (but possible)
No party skills until 4th job.
Only tank ability is puppet (warriors have skills to increase weapon defense, and hp. Magicians have magic guard/magic armor to decrease damage taken. Thieves have avoid-ability and alchemist/chakra later on to improve regeneration)


NOTE: Bowmen are not as useless up close as sins, as the skill, power knockback (pkb) knocks close enemies away much more easily.;

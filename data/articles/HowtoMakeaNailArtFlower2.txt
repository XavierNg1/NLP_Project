 You’ll want to choose colors that contrast enough with your base color that your flowers stand out. Choose opaque polishes, because it is not easy to go over an intricate flower design with a second coat of polish. However, sheer polishes can certainly be used to create more subtle flowers., If your nail polish brush is small enough to create the dots, certainly go ahead and use them. If not, set them aside and instead dip a toothpick into the polish. You should get enough polish on the end to form a dot. If the toothpick is too pointy and isn’t picking up enough polish when dipped, gently press the end of it into a hard surface until it flattens slightly.








These dots will be forming the center of the flower, so place them on your nails accordingly. You may want to just do one flower per nail, or several. Leave room for the “petal” dots that you’ll be painting next!
If you don’t have toothpicks, or don’t like the effect you’re creating with a toothpick, feel free to use any other thin tool to create the dots.
 Dip your brush or toothpick into your second color of polish. Get enough polish on the end of the toothpick to form a dot. You will be placing dots around the original dots you created to form the petals of the flower. You can make as many petals as you’d like, but typically flowers are created with five or six.








Once you’ve created the petal dots, you can leave them as is, or drag them to create different shapes. For example, try placing the petal dots farther away from the center dot, and then using your toothpick to “drag” the polish to the center. This will create more teardrop-shaped petals.
Don’t be afraid to get creative. Experiment with different colors, different petal shapes, etc. Once you get more comfortable using a toothpick to apply the polish, you can try different things.

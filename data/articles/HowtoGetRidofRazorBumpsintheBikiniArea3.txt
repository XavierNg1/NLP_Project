 You could still experience ingrown hairs after waxing, but the tip will be composed of finer new growth, instead of coarse hair that's merely had the top shaved off.


If you do decide to wax, aim to make an appointment every six to eight weeks in the beginning. You might be able to go for longer stretches without waxing later.
Choose a reputable waxing salon. Ask around, or search reviews online.
Know what to expect. Your skin will probably be a little red and irritated when you leave, but you shouldn't have open cuts or dark, widespread bruises. Additionally, if you notice that your skin is infected a day or two after your appointment, start applying an antibiotic cream and notify the salon immediately.
 Contrary to popular belief, laser hair removal won't completely remove your hair forever. However, it will significantly reduce growth.


Be aware that laser hair removal works best on dark hair and light skin. If your skin and your hair are too close to the same color (whether it's too light or too dark), you might not be a good candidate for treatment.
Laser hair removal is expensive, and you'll need at least four to six treatments. Price it out and watch for promotions.

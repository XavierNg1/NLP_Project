 Another way to get into a pretzel stretch is to tuck your shin into your body and then transition from that pose. Start by bending your left leg and pulling your shin in towards your stomach. Wrap your arms around your shin and pull it in gently to deepen the stretch.








Next, wrap your arms under your hamstring to deepen the stretch even more. Continue to hold your thigh close to your body and steady yourself as needed., Let go of your thigh with your left arm, but continue to hold your thigh with your right arm. Place your left arm under your left thigh and reach towards your back. When you feel ready, release your right arm as well and reach back towards your left arm.








Grasp your hands behind you and hold.
 Your left arm should keep your left thigh pressed against your body. When you feel ready, you can start to straighten your leg out. Point your toe upwards and continue to balance.








Hold the pose.

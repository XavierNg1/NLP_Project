 Where did you get your opossum? Any breeder, pet store or animal shelter that gives you your pet should be able to tell you who their veterinarian is. If you got it from a previous owner or from another location though, this may not work out for you.;
, Google (or use your preferred search engine) every vet clinic in your area. You can also use your local phone book to find as many offices as possible. If you're having trouble, you can ask around - who do your friends go to? Local pet stores, breeders, and shelters?

, Phone, email, or even Facebook are all good ways to come in easy contact with every vet in your city. Ask every vet you find whether or not they have the knowledge and experience to deal with an opossum. If you know exactly what's wrong with it (if you need it 'fixed' or if it has a certain illness or injury, etc) then be sure to mention that that's what you're looking for. If you just want to know there's someone available, all you need to know is whether or not they'll be able to help.
 For example "Hi, I have a pet opossum. I was wondering if you have any veterinarians working at your clinic who have the knowledge and experience to treat one should the need arise?" If the receptionist says no, ask if they have any suggestions of who to phone next. Vets like to help each other out, as it's all about the clients!

, You're bound to find a vet that knows opossums without too much effort, but it it does take long, just keep going. This is your pet, finding a vet for them is very important.

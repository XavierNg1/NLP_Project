 Warm up for at least ten minutes before each long-distance bicycling session. Try dynamic stretches like star jumps (jumping jacks), jogging in place, and burpees. Be sure to stretch your legs out to reduce the risk of leg cramps. Pay special attention to the thighs.
 Start cycling at a speed which suits you, and try to keep up this pace as best you can. Use a lower gear so that you don't wear yourself out. Try to keep up a rate of roughly 90 rpm (revolutions per minute) on a low gear to go easy on your muscles and lungs.Do not push yourself too hard, especially if you'll be cycling for multiple days in a row. If you're cycling with a slightly-faster partner, try to check the temptation to keep up.
On the other hand: do not ride in a gear that is too low. If you're spinning the wheels without putting any effort into pedaling, you'll needlessly tire out your legs. Find a balance that works for you., When you come to an upward slope, change into a lower gear so that you can more easily reach the top. Change to a higher gear when going down a hill to create a bit more friction between your tires and the road. Throughout the ride, stay aware of how hard you're working. If you are struggling to push the pedals, you should switch into a lower gear to conserve your energy.
 Even if you feel strong, stop every 10–20 miles (16–32 km) to give your body a rest and ensure that everything's running smoothly. Rehydrate by drinking some water, and boost your energy levels with a quick snack. Check your bike for any problems. Stretch to keep your muscles from tightening. Continue to take breaks until you arrive at your destination.
 Continue to consume water and electrolytes for at least several hours after you are done cycling for the day. If you'll be getting into the saddle again in the morning, take a few minutes to look over your map, your gear, and your goals for tomorrow.

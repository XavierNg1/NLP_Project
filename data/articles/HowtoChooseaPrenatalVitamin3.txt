 While it's alright if you miss the occasional prenatal vitamin, it's important that you take your prenatal vitamin every day. To make it a habit, try to take the vitamin at the same time every day. If you need to take two smaller prenatal vitamins in one day, try to take them about 12 hours apart.For example, try to take your prenatal vitamin with a snack or meal every morning. If you're taking two small doses, take one around breakfast and one after dinner.
 Prenatal vitamins that contain iron are known to contribute to constipation. They may also cause diarrhea or gas. If you're having prenatal vitamin side effects, try a different type of prenatal or take the vitamin with food. You should also drink more water and increase your fiber intake.If you're still experiencing side effects, ask your doctor to recommend a different prenatal.
 Most prenatal vitamins are designed to fulfill your daily nutrient intake for a number of vitamins and minerals. If you take a prenatal vitamin as well as another supplement, you could be getting too much of a particular nutrient. Just take the prenatal unless you're instructed differently by your doctor.For example, if you take a prenatal vitamin as well as a folic acid supplement, you could be getting a daily dose of folic acid that's harmful.
 If you're experiencing severe nausea and vomiting during the first trimester, ask your doctor if you can wait to begin prenatal vitamins. The iron in prenatals can make these symptoms worse. Research studies suggest that it's safe to wait until these symptoms go away before starting a prenatal vitamin with iron.You should still take the recommended folic acid before beginning prenatal vitamins. Folic acid shouldn't make your nausea or vomiting worse.

 This will give them a chance to think through their plans with a little bit of feedback. Sometimes, they will need your help with ideas, but other times, they will just be glad that someone is talking through the plan with them. Either way, your loved one will need support when it comes to formulating the next steps that they need to take.Try asking your loved one something like, “So what are you going to do?” or “Do you have any ideas about your next move?”

, Many people have talents that lie outside of their career. If your loved one has been laid off, this is a perfect time to put those talents to use. This could be for part-time money in between jobs, or a change of career entirely.For example, your loved one might be passionate about working with youth, but was formerly employed at a bank. This can be a good time to redirect their career to include their passions.
 Just because you learned your skills in one job doesn’t mean they are applicable somewhere else. Help your loved one think of new ways to apply their skill set. This is also a good time to expand their skill set with training or conferences.If your loved one worked in a bank and has a sound grasp of financial concepts, they might consider applying to companies in need of financial planners or other monetary guidance.
 The goal is for your loved one to make it through the layoff and adjust to a new life. The details are for them to work out. If you advocate too strongly for a specific way of doing things, you can make your loved one feel like they are failing if they do things another way.For example, if your loved one is thinking about going back to school, but is not sure what he or she wants to study, don’t try to steer him or her towards anything. Just asking something like, “What are you interested in studying?”

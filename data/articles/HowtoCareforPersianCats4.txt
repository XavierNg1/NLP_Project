 While Persians have been bred for their unique looks, this same breeding has also led them to become predisposed to certain diseases. While there is nothing you can do to prevent your cat from getting the disease is she is genetically prone, you can watch for signs of these diseases and have your cat treated as soon as she develops the condition.
 This genetic fault affects one in three Persian cats and results in the formation of multiple fluid-filled cysts within the kidney that can lead to renal disease. Once the problem i identified your pet’s lifespan can be extended by prescription renal diets and medications such as ACE inhibitors which can aid the filtering capacity of the kidneys.Symptoms include:


Drinking more than normal.
Reduced appetite.
Lethargy.
Weight loss.
Vomiting.
If you recognize these signs in your pet then take her to a veterinarian.
 This disease causes the heart wall to become thickened which then impairs the heart’s ability to pump blood around the body. Luckily, there are drugs such as diuretics and ACE inhibitors that can decrease the workload on the heart and increase longevity.Signs that your pet has heart disease are vague and non-specific. However, you can look out for things like:


Exercise intolerance.
Sleeping more than normal.
Lack of interest in food or grooming herself.
Shallow breathing and breathing through an open mouth.
 PRA is a genetically programmed thinning of the retina that eventually leads to blindness. Whilst it sounds distressing, cats are actually very good at compensating for blindness. They are adept at using their whiskers, sense of smell, and hearing to move around. If your cat does go blind, it is generally best to keep her indoors and avoid rearranging the furniture, as she could become disoriented.Signs of blindness include:


Bumping into objects left in her path that are not normally there.
Pupils that cease forming slits in bright light, and will remain large and black.

 Although a full haircut or restyling can take much longer than 10 minutes (for both men and women), there are quick changes you can make to help yourself look younger. The simplest is simply to let your hair down; this will appear more youthful and relax tension in your forehead.If you part your hair (men or women), try switching from a center part to a side part; this will also help you appear younger.;
, As bodies age, they often begin to grow more facial hair. While this is not necessarily a problem, it can indicate age and detract from a more youthful look. Keep an eye out for excessive or bushy eyebrows (men and women), nose and ear hair (men), and general facial hair (men and women).
 Use a whitening toothpaste; whiter teeth will make your smile look younger and more vibrant, which will help your entire face look younger too.
 Although glasses may be associated with intelligence, they can also make you look years older than you are. Avoid wire and metal frames, and opt for a black or dark-colored pair of plastic frames instead.If youâ€™re not currently shopping for glasses, try wearing contacts instead; these will also keep you looking younger.

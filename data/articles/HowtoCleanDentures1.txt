 A denture brush is recommended in order to clean all areas of the denture. If you prefer to use an ordinary toothbrush, use extra attention to reach all curved areas of your dentures. If you wear a single denture, you will need a separate brush for your denture in order to preserve the condition of the toothbrush you use on your natural teeth., Start by accident-proofing the surface you will work over. Place a face cloth in the bottom of the sink and partially fill the sink with water to provide a cushion should the denture be dropped. Dentures can break if dropped on a hard surface.


Grasp the dentures in your non-dominant hand, but don't squeeze too hard. Dentures can break.
 You can use a gel or paste specifically designed for dentures or a little soap or other mild, non-toxic cleansing agent. Don't use regular toothpaste or any powdered or abrasive cleaners. They may scratch the denture and provide places for bacteria to thrive and may irritate your oral mucosa., With the denture brush in your dominant hand, brush all areas of the denture. Ensure that the bristles reach all the grooved and curved areas. Don't scrub too hard, though, as you don't want to damage your dentures.Rigorous brushing will help prevent the formation of tartar.
 Under running water, use the brush to rinse away remaining cleanser and debris. Inspect your denture for cleanliness. Areas that feel "slippery" may indicate that there is still plaque on the surface., Now you can place the dentures back in your mouth if you are ready to wear them, or, if not, you can place them in water to soak them overnight.

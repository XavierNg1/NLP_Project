 Popsicle trays create the best results, while ice cube trays make miniature ice pops. The molds should be freezer-safe, preferably hard plastic.;
, Popsicles don't have to be just juice. Experiment with different varieties of drinks, by making gatorade popsicles, pudding popsicles, smoothie popsicles, or ice cube popsicles.
 You don't want to overfill it because the mixture will expand while freezing. It also may make it harder for you to get it out of the mold if overfilled.
 Aluminum foil works best, but you can also use plastic wrap. Be sure that it's on tightly.
 Make sure it touches the bottom of it. The foil or wrap should hold the popsicle stick in its place.
 Check on it at intervals if desired.Â 

, Serve as needed.

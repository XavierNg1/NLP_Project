 You'll need to wash one medium onion, 2 green chilies, 1 stalk of celery, and 3 medium tomatoes. Use a sharp knife to carefully dice the onion so you get 1 cup of diced onion. Dice the chilies so you end up with 1/2 cup of diced chilies. Chop the celery into small pieces to make 1/4 of a cup and chop the three tomatoes. Place all of these in a large sauce pot.You can add any of the juice from the tomatoes into the sauce pot along with the vegetables.;
, Place 2 pounds (907 g) of ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the ground beef and stir it occasionally to break it up into small pieces. Once the meat has cooked, carefully drain off any of the grease and discard it.You can use any type of ground beef in this recipe. Keep in mind that leaner ground beef may not be as tender or flavorful as the higher fat ground beef, but it will be lower in fat.

 Decorating your home and/or yard for the Fourth of July is fun and a great way to create a festive atmosphere. You donâ€™t have to do anything elaborate, though. Visit a dollar store for affordable decorations, such as red, white, and blue pinwheels and streamers or mini American flags.Cut star shapes out of red, white, and blue construction paper. Punch a hole at the top of each one, tie a string through the hole, and hang around the house or yard.
 Red, white, and blue plates and napkins are certainly patriotic, but they tend to cost more than plain white supplies. Stick to white plastic cutlery, paper plates, and napkins to save money.Your decorations will be enough to create a festive atmosphere.
 Providing materials for the kids to decorate will keep them entertained during the day while awaiting the evening fireworks display.


Use white butcher paper as tablecloths and let the kids decorate it with red, white, and blue crayons or markers.
Have the kids draw pictures of colorful fireworks and display them around the house or yard.

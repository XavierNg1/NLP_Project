 Put them into a sieve or a colander and take them outside, then stir them around with a wooden spoon (getting the air flowing around them) or pass them from one colander to another. After a minute or so they will have cooled to around room temperature. Alternatively, once you get to know the process, you can stop the roasting prematurely and let them continue to roast the few moments as they cool in a kitchen bowl. Never use water to cool down the beans, as water will affect the oils of the beans that give then their flavour.
 Put them into a tin with a loose fitting lid and keep away from strong flavors.

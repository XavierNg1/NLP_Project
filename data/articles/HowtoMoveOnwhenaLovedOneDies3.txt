 For example, a TV Program they liked, a person with the same scarf, a book they wanted to read may remind you of them. Try pointing out things that represent the person who died to other people as well. When you walk past a cafe, don't just think something like "....... would have ordered a latte," think "....... would have ordered a latte and ..... would want a coke, and ........ would definitely buy fruit juice..." and so on. Soon you'll be so tired of pointing everything out that you'll just stop completely.

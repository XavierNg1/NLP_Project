 In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the water to a boil over medium heat. It’s important to use a heavy saucepan, because this will help prevent the fufu from burning as it cooks and thickens.

If you don’t have access to ground semolina and ground rice, you can substitute 2 cups (454 g) each of ready-made baking mix (such as Bisquick) and instant mashed potatoes, plus 2 cups (244 g) of cassava or tapioca flour., Slowly pour the semolina into the water, whisking constantly as you do. Once all the semolina has been incorporated, switch to a wooden spoon. Stir constantly for three to four minutes, giving the mixture time to thicken.

Fufu made in a pot can get quite thick, so you may need to get someone to help you hold the pot while you stir.
 Slowly pour the ground rice into the mixture as well, stirring constantly to mix all the ingredients. When all the rice has been stirred in, put on the lid, lower the heat, and let the fufu cook for 10 minutes., Use a ladle to portion out the fufu, and serve it fresh and hot with your favorite soups and stews.

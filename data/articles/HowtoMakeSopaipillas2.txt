 Making sopapillas with tortillas is easy because nearly all the work is removed. You will need a bag of your favorite flour tortillas, oil for frying, and your toppings of choice.
 Pour your oil into a pan deep enough so the tortillas can be fully immersed. Wait for it to heat to about 400 °F (204 °C).
 An easy way to do this is to cut the tortilla like a pie; you end with triangles with one rounded side.
 You can fry multiples at once, enough to fill the pan. Allow each side to turn golden brown before flipping.
 Place them on paper towels over a wire rack to allow them to drain.
 Try rolling these in cinnamon and sugar and dipping in honey for a sweet treat.

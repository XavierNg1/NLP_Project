 Approximately one week prior to your surgery, you doctor will need to perform a painless ultrasound test. This will measure the size and shape of your eye, helping to determine the best type of lens implant for you., Your doctor may prescribe antibiotic eye drops to be used for 1-2 days prior to the surgery. This is a preventative measure that lowers your risk of infection., Your doctor may recommend that you temporarily stop taking certain medications. Discuss any medications you are taking with your doctor at least two weeks before your scheduled procedure, and follow your doctor’s instructions.This will apply to any medications that could increase your risk of bleeding.
Additionally, some of the drugs prescribed to treat prostate problems have been shown to interfere with cataract surgery.
 It can be scary to let a surgeon cut open your eye (even if it’s only a tiny incision). As such, some people opt to be “put to sleep” with a general anesthetic. However, you should consider “staying awake” with a local anesthetic. This offers far few risks of complication, and a quicker recovery.Local anesthetic is administered "locally," to block any painful sensations where your surgeon will be working. You will be awake and aware, but you should not feel any pain. Local anesthetic is safe and carries very few risks.
General anesthetic affects your entire body and renders you temporarily unconscious. It must only be done under the supervision of a trained anesthesiologist. General anesthetic can lead to changes in blood pressure, which (although rare) can be dangerous. Furthermore, recovering from general anesthetic is more difficult and takes more time.
 As with most surgeries, you will likely be advised not to eat or drink anything for 12 hours prior to the procedure. Eat a nice meal and drink a big glass of water, then refrain from eating or drinking for 12 hours.

 Carbon monoxide is caused when fuels, such as the natural gas used with your gas logs, are not completely burned. Unsafe levels of carbon monoxide cannot be detected by smell or sight and can cause death. For your safety, a carbon monoxide detector should be installed in the fireplace room and each bedroom in the home. The detector will be your only warning against unsafe levels of carbon monoxide in the home.;

Shut off the gas supply: If your fireplace is already configured for a gas log application, then be sure to shut off the gas supply before attempting these procedures. Failure to follow this step can result in a fire or explosion that may result in property damage, injury, or even loss of life. Once the gas line is shut off, proceed to Part 1, Step 2.
Install a gas line. If you were using the fireplace for a wood burning application, you must first install a gas line before you can install gas logs. This step should be completed by a certified professional. Improper installation of the gas line can cause property damage, serious injury, or death. Once the gas line is installed, proceed to Part 1, Step 5.
 Put on a pair of work gloves and carefully remove the old logs from the firebox. The logs will typically lift straight off the grate. Ensure you have a box or trash bag to hold the old logs after removal.
 Once the logs are removed, there will likely be a grate installed in the firebox. Remove the masonry screws that secure the grate to the firebox, and place the grate to the side for disposal.
 Ensuring the gas line is shut off first, disconnect the gas line from the burner. Remove the old burner and place aside for disposal.
 Before installing your new log set, thoroughly clean inside the firebox. Sweep up any soot, dirt, or debris, and then use a shop vacuum to remove any finer particles that are difficult to sweep. If the fireplace was used to burn wood, contact a chimney sweep to have the chimney professionally cleaned.

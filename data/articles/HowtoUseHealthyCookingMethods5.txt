 (4.4 to 8.8 g) of olive oil inside a frying pan at medium-high to medium heat. Once it is heated add either vegetables or thin cuts of meat and saut√© them. This means you should fry the surfaces of the food with the hot oil.
 Add enough low-sodium chicken stock, water or wine to the dish to cover about 1/4 of the food, after 2 to 5 minutes of sauteing. Cover the pan for 5 to 10 minutes.

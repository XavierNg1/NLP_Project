 Depending on your orthotic requirements and budget, you have options either way. In general, if you have severe feet issues, you will need more customized orthotics.

Custom orthotics are more on the expensive side, but provide better support for you as they are made to fit your feet. These may require a fitting with a trained professional for best results.
Orthotics are also available at most pharmacies, online, and some are available at better athletic shoe stores as well. These generally offer mild-to-moderate support, and for common foot issues such as plantar fasciitis. While these are often a good and thrifty solution, you also do not get the guidance to pick out the best one nor necessarily the one that suits your needs the best.
Be careful not to buy insoles which only absorb odors; these are not orthotic insoles.
For best results, each pair of shoe should have its own set of insoles. Over-the-counter insoles are often much more affordable if you do not need very particular insoles. When you buy a new pair of shoes, get a pair of insoles as well.

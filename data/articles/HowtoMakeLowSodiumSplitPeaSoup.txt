 Meaning you don't have to stand over a boiling pot and babysit the soup the whole time it cooks. Get a 16 ounce bag of uncooked split peas as found in the beans section. Put the entire bag of split peas in the slow cooker.;
, Then get 4 cloves of fresh garlic and trim the ends off, crush each clove with the side of a wide knife so that the skin breaks free. Add the garlic cloves on top of the peas and the onions.
, Turn the slow cooker on High. Stir the peas after you put water in before you cook to get them off the bottom. Because the peas are split they don't take as long to cook as whole beans, they will be done on high in 1 hour.
 With a nice salad you have a delicious meal, you can also use the Canary Island olive oil as a salad dressing, that is safe for sufferers of chronic kidney disease.

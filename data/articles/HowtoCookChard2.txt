 You'll start by heating a pan over medium heat.Both nonstick pans and stainless steel pans work fine for this., Add several tablespoons worth of olive oil to the pan.If the oil gets super smoky, your pan is too hot. If you want a slightly tastier and less healthy variation, you can use butter instead of the oil.

If you wish to add minced garlic or onion to the dish for flavor, now would be the time as well., Place your prepared chard in the pan. You can pile it up high, even into a mound. When the chard cooks it will lose a lot of volume and fit in the pan.Add as much as you can fit without spilling.

Make sure that your chard is dry before you put it in the pan.The water on wet chard will cause splatter when it makes contact with the oil. , You will saute the chard for a total of 6-8 minutes.Start by cooking the chard for about 2 to 3 minutes, then gently stir and rearrange the leaves so that the top leaves move to the bottom of the pan. As the leaves cook, they will start to wilt, soften, and darken.
 As it cooks, the chard will turn dark green.It will also lose a lot of volume. The chard is done when it is tender and soft but not mushy. Once your chard is done, remove it from heat and turn off the stove., However, if you wish to serve plain sauteed chard, you can add a squeeze of lemon, salt, pepper, or even red pepper flakes.This is especially tasty if you sauteed using butter and garlic.

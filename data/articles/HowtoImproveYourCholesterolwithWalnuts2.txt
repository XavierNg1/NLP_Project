 To help reduce cholesterol, you should eat at least 30 grams of walnuts each day. This is approximately 1/4 cup or one to one and a half ounce.This amount of walnuts is 196 calories, but since they are healthy fats, they are good calories., You can buy whole walnuts or buy them already shelled and in pieces at the grocery store. If you prefer whole walnuts, choose those that have their shells intact. If you are buying walnut pieces, make certain they are not shriveled. The walnuts should smell fresh. The polyunsaturated fats in walnuts can go rancid. When they do, the walnuts will smell bad.


You can store shelled and unshelled walnuts in the refrigerator for six months. If you store them in the freezer, they should be good for at least a year. You can store unshelled walnuts in a cool, dark, and dry place, but check them for unusual odors after a few months.If you have the room to store them, buying in bulk can often save money.
Make sure that your walnuts are not blanched. They should have the skin on them, which is a flaky, whitish, sometimes waxy covering on nut. The skin contains many of the healthier parts of the nut.
 Before starting any diet change for your cholesterol, make sure to discuss it with your doctor. Talk to your doctor, or a dietician, about your cholesterol, any cholesterol medication you are taking, and your health goals.

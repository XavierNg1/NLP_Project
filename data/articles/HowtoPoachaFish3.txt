 Poaching fish is a great way to preserve it for a few extra days so you don't have to eat it the same night you bring it home. If you happen to have access to a lot of fresh fish, and you want to be able to eat some later in the week, this method will allow you to keep it in the refrigerator longer than you otherwise would, then prepare the fish using any method you choose when you're ready.


For example, if you want to have fried fish on Friday night, but you know the fish won't keep until then, poaching it will preserve the texture and flavor and allow you to finish the dish when you're ready.
Of course, freezing or canning are also excellent methods for preserving fish.
 Using either the court bouillon or olive oil poaching method, poach the fish for half the recommended cooking time. Check the fish after half the time has passed; it should be slightly opaque in color, but not cooked enough to easily flake. When the fish is about half cooked, remove it from the poaching liquid.
 Place it in the refrigerator and use the poached fish within a week. Since it's only half cooked, you can sauté, grill, or fry the fish and retain its flavor and texture without overcooking it.


Make sure the fish is cooked completely when you use it in your intended dish. Whether you sauté, grill or fry it, be sure it's opaque and flaky.
Don't keep the fish for longer than a week before using. Even fully-cooked fish doesn't keep forever in the refrigerator.

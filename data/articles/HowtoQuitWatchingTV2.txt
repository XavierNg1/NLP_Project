 This is a critical step because if you do not find something that will keep your interest, you will fall back on your ol' faithful crutch, the TV. Look up a volunteer program, 'check out' that book, books of CD or magazine out of the library, find a new hobby, pick a craft, introduce your self to your family or even your neighbors, or any thing else that you want to do that you are currently not doing. You may want to schedule something during your usual TV-watching time; you cannot watch TV at your house and volunteer at the local soup kitchen at the same time.;
, Start with a small amount of time, (30 minutes, 1 hour) and then expand each day or week.
, Then increase the time. Soon enough your TV time will be replaced with something productive. You may even get to the point where watching TV is a waste of your time and your money. Also, you can cut you expenses down by down grading your cable or satellite package.

 Everyone is just as nervous as you are! Just chill-ax and try to make friends! And if you don't plan on making new friends, then just stick with your besties in the halls and in what ever classes you share!;
, These days, not many of us middle-schoolers are fans of the big-shots and pretty girls/boys. Just be yourself and you'll find tons of friends!

, You always want to start out with a great first impression! So try to doll yourself up a bit the first few days of school to make EVERYTHING your style shows look rad!

, Don't be shy! Tons of people will probably walk up to you and say hi! So smile, greet them, and try to start up a good conversation! Odds are you'll become good friends.
 People will think your a downer and no fun to be around. You want to be confident about who you are and what you love!

, It might start out fine, but soon enough people will find out you're a fraud and repel being any kind of friend with you. Even your friends you've had before middle-school will feel disappointed with you.
 STRUT IT UP! Show who you are and SHINE! It can be as little as wearing makeup or as big as going by a different name! Just do whatever you can to find out what's your passion and style! Odds are you'll find others like you and make some awesome friends!

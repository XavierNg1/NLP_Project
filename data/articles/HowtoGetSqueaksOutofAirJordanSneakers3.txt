 If the tongue of your shoe is squeaking, this is likely caused by friction between a part of the tongue and the rest of the shoe.Pull the tongue as free of the shoe as you are able and lightly sand its edges with a fine grit rating (120 to 220 grit) sandpaper.Depending on the material of your shoe, you may want to use a finer or coarser sandpaper. Extra fine sandpaper (240+ grit rating) may be best for delicate material.
Avoid sanding visible parts of the tongue if it can be helped. Although sanding will smooth rough spots creating squeaks, it may cloud or deform the surface of shoe material.
 If a small hole or loose heel is the source of the squeaking, you can repair this with glue. Use water and heat resistant urethane rubber for soles. Super glue works well for repairing holes for most shoe material. Follow the glue directions for best results.Some glues may contain chemicals that do damage to the rubber or material of your shoe. When in doubt, consult a shoe repair professional on the best glue for your particular shoe., If none of these de-squeaking techniques worked, there may be a physical defect with your shoe at the root of the problem. In most cases, these kinds of repairs can only be made by professionals with special tools.


As shoes are broken in, they should squeak less. If your shoes continue to squeak even after being broken in, this may be a sign your shoes are in need of professional repair.

 Though not true acrylic paint, this mix is more adaptable than many of the other paints intended for younger users. Youâ€™ll need:


A plastic mixing container
Wooden chopstick
Liquid paint
Common white glue

, You can alter the ratio slightly to modify the clarity of the color, but too much water-based paint will break down the glue altogether.


Some versions of the white glue dry clearer than others. For more vibrant colors (rather than pastels), you may want to find a variety with that dries more clear., The faux acrylic paint will be ready for use in a matter of minutes.
 Unlike the water-based paint you had started with, your new faux acrylic paint can stick to most any surface.

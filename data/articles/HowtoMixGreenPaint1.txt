 Mixing paint seems like it might be simple. Most people will reach directly for a paintbrush when mixing the paint, but this is actually not a good idea. Not only will you risk ruining your paintbrush, but you won't get a very smooth color. Here is a complete list of what you will need:


Blue paint
Yellow paint
Paint palette, paper plate, or cup
Something to mix with (palette knife, spoon, popsicle stick, etc);
, This will count as "one part yellow." When mixing paints, you will be working with "parts" as a form of measurement.
 To begin with, make the blue drop the same size as the yellow drop. This will give you a basic shade of green. If you want to make a different shade, click here.
 Keep mixing the paint until the color is uniform and you don't see any streaks. If you are using a thin paint, like tempra, poster, or craft-grade acrylic paint, try using a spoon or popsicle stick. If you are using a thicker, paste-like paint, such as oil or acrylic, use a palette knife to smoosh and move the paint around until it you get an even color.
 You could create a green landscape or use green to mix realistic skin tones. The possibilities are endless!

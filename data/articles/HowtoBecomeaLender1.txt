 For the best results, you'll want all of your lendable money to be collected in one central account or "pot." This will also help you to figure out how much you can lend without negatively impacting your own household budget.


It's best to plan for a worst-case scenario where you only lend money that you can live without, in case a loan does not get repaid.;
, Before you get into actually lending out money, you'll want to look at several factors including how long you want that money to be tied up, and how much you plan to make with it. This will help you narrow down lending choices further on in the process.
 The plain fact that experienced money handlers understand is that every investment has a tax burden, and lending is no exception. As a personal taxpayer, you will have to pay taxes on income from interest payments, which will be taken out of your gross gains, or yield. It's incumbent on you as the lender to figure out how this will affect your future tax bills.

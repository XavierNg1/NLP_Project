Shaving Cream
Vodka
White Wine and Baking Soda

, Flatten the shaving cream into the fabric with the back of a spoon before washing the fabric as usual. 








Shaving cream’s thick, foamy texture combined with its cleansing components work wonders on tough stains — saturating and lifting the stain from the fabric. , Blot the stain with a cloth and continue pouring. Allow the vodka to completely soak in and watch the stain fade. Wash as usual.









Red wine contains anthocyanins, or color pigments, which can be dissolved by alcohol. Therefore vodka, gin, or any clear alcohol with a higher proof than red wine can remove the stain. , First soak the stain with white wine. Some believe white wine dilutes the color while preventing the stain from setting in (warning to follow in the bullets below).









Make a baking soda paste using a 3-1 ratio of baking soda to water. Mix together until a paste is formed. Spread a thick layer of baking soda paste over the stain and let sit for an hour. Periodically spray with water to keep the area moist, preventing the stain from settling into the fabric. After the stain is removed, wash as usual.
White wine is one of the most common discrepancies in red wine stain removal. Though many swear it dilutes the stain’s color, others say mixing fire with fire only aggravates the stain. Tap water can be used as a replacement if you are weary of this particular option.

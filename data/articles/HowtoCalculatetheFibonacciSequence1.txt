 The number of rows will depend on how many numbers in the Fibonacci sequence you want to calculate.

For example, if you want to find the fifth number in the sequence, your table will have five rows.

When using the table method, you cannot find a random number farther down in the sequence without calculating all the number before it. For example, if you want to find the 100th number in the sequence, you have to calculate the 1st through 99th numbers first. This is why the table method only works well for numbers early in the sequence.
;
, This means just entering a sequence of sequential ordinal numbers, beginning with "1st."

The term refers to the position number in the Fibonacci sequence. 

For example, if you want to figure out the fifth number in the sequence, you will write 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th down the left column. This will show you what the first through fifth terms in the sequence are.
 This is the starting point for the Fibonacci Sequence. In other words, the first term in the sequence is 1.

The correct Fibonacci sequence always starts on 1. If you begin with a different number, you are not finding the proper pattern of the Fibonacci sequence.
 This will give you the second number in the sequence.

Remember, to find any given number in the Fibonacci sequence, you simply add the two previous numbers in the sequence.

To create the sequence, you should think of 0 coming before 1 (the first term), so 1 + 0 = 1.
 This will give you the third number in the sequence.

1 + 1 = 2. The third term is 2.


1 + 2 = 3. The fourth term is 3.
 This will give you the fifth number in the sequence.

2 + 3 = 5. The fifth term is 5.
 When you use this method, you are using the formula Fn=Fn−1+Fn−2{\displaystyle F_{n}=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}}.Since this is not a closed formula, however, you cannot use it to calculate any given term in the sequence without calculating all the previous numbers.

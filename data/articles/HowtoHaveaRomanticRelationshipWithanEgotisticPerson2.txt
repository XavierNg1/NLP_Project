 Your egotist may tend to talk about themselves frequently and at great lengths. If you feel like your partner does not give you enough space to talk about you, address it.You deserve to have this relationship and this partner be as much of a sounding board as he expects you to be for him. Try addressing it directly, or making it more of a new pattern in your conversations.


"John, I really need to talk to you about something that is bothering me. I know you have things you want to say as well, but I really need someone to listen. Would you be willing to focus on just this problem and help me?”
Bring up topics more regularly that you are interested it. You may have gotten into the habit of just listening to your partner and letting him control the conversations. Start a new pattern of conversation by interjecting with topics you are interested in or thoughts you are having.
 There is a solid chance that your egotistic partner is going to do or say something that makes you angry or sad at some point, because what you are doing is difficult and can be frustrating.Communication is key in any relationship, especially when you are working through some things.If you are really bothered by a particular action of your partner or by something she said, tell her. Try to add a compliment or a praise in and then tell her what upsets you, carefully and tactfully.


"Jane, I love it when you teach me how to cook. You are really good at it, and I want to learn. It just really hurts me when you tell it to me like I'm a nine year old kid."
”I understand you have a very strong opinion about this. Maybe you know more about it than I do, too. I would just really like for you to respect my opinion even if it is different than yours and not laugh at me for sharing it with you.”

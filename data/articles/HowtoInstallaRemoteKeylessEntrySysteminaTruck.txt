 Before you investigate further, decide what features will work best for you. Key entry systems can be for the driver's side door only, or they can be for all passenger doors. Make sure you know which system is right for you.;
, Different models will have different features, but be prepared to spend more on more popular or praised systems. Check different websites and discussion boards dealing with both keyless entry systems and your specific trunk model to learn about the systems from those currently using them.
 If possible, talk to your auto dealer about which brands of systems work better in your particular truck. The dealer will also be able to give you information about standard factory keyless entry systems and factory installation.



Read the instructions. Not all models of keyless entry systems are the same, so be sure to read the instructions so you know the exact limits and specs of your system.
Disconnect your truck's battery. This is crucial and will prevent any electric discharge and possible shock later in the process.
Attach the keyless entry system to the underside of the dash. Make sure it is securely fastened with zip ties. Also fasten any stray wires with zip ties to insure they won't come loose. Be sure the system is placed where it will not interfere with other systems, such as air conditioning or breaks.
Consult your truck owner's manual to find which color wires control which door locking mechanisms. Once you have located these wires, solder them to the appropriate wires on your keyless entry system. Tape them with electrical tape to insure the wires stay together and maintain a connection.
The keyless entry system requires a constant power supply. One close source of power is the ignition switch wiring. Locate this using your owner's manual and solder the red power wire from your entry system to the ignition switch.
 Lock and unlock your doors to make sure the new system works.

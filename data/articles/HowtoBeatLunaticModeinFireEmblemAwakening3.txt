 The Weapon Triangle is the Fire Emblem version of Rock, Paper Scissors with the three main types of weapons. Swords beat axes, axes beat lances and lances beat swords. Having the WTA (Weapon Triangle Advantage) can influence your damage output and accuracy, so make sure to incorporate it into your strategy. Magic and bows are neutral in the Weapon Triangle.
 A weapon or stave can only be used so many times, indicated by the two numbers next to the name of a given item. The first number is how many usages a weapon, stave or healing item has left, and the second number is the limit of how many uses the item started with. For example, Bronze weapons start out with 50 uses. If you use a Bronze Sword ten times, the durability will read 40/50. Once the durability reaches zero, the item will break or disappear. Always make sure you have weapons with enough durability to last you the chapter.
 You can forge at any shop in the game after the first chapters, and it can really save you in a pinch if you need a powerful weapon for certain enemies. You can increase a weapon's Might, Hit and Crit to influence how powerful it is, it's accuracy and critical hit rate. Forges can get expensive later in the game with Steel and Silver weapons, but forging for Bronze and Iron weapons is cheaper and more worthwhile earlier in the game.

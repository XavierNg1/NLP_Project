 Depending on your comfort level and the mood of your tarantula, either remove the tarantula with your hand or by gently scooping it into a dish. Never try to remove a moody or molting tarantula as they may flick hair at you or bite.;
, If they are in a dish, remember to add air holes for proper ventilation.
 Never reuse bedding, as it may have feces or food left in it.
 Wash this well with soap and water. You can use the same soap you use on your dishes, but remember to rinse well. If you use a sponge, always use a new, clean sponge as bacteria can build up in old sponges.
 Again, dish soap is fine, but always rinse well.
 Check on your tarantula while waiting to make sure they have not escaped. Remember, tarantulas are notorious escape artists.
 Be sure to add enough to allow your tarantula to burrow as the breed needs.
 Remember to fill the water dish before placing it in the terrarium.
, This is their way of thanking you!

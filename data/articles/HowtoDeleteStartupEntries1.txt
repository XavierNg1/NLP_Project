You have to provide administrator permissions in order to make any changes to the registry.;
, These keys are:

HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx
Don't worry if the keys ending with RunOnceEx, RunServices and RunServicesOnce don't exist - this just means that no programs have created startup entries that would cause programs to run once and then close themselves automatically and trigger system services.
 They should be named after the corresponding programs.

Make sure not to delete any important values out of any other keys if you don't know what you're doing.
 Close the registry editor and restart your computer/log off and back on.

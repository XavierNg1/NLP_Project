 Taking a shower, eating meals, and going to work are priorities, but you may want to reconsider helping your friend give her dog a bath. The key to stopping yourself from getting drained when making a schedule is to prioritize. Although you may have to make sacrifices here and there, you’ll likely make up for it when you feel less stressed.


There’s a chance you could upset people if they aren’t included in your priorities. However, you have to ask yourself what is more important, pleasing others or taking care of yourself or your family?, When compiling your daily schedule or “to-do” list, make sure to include how long each task will take to complete. Be honest with yourself when thinking about the time table. Cramming too much into your day will drain and overwhelm you.


You don’t have to be exact in your timing; use 30 minute increments to guide you. You’ll likely have some wiggle room using that method which allows you to finish early or late in some activities and still be on time., Perhaps one of the most exhausting activities a person can engage in is multi-tasking. Although you may think you are being productive when you try to accomplish a variety of tasks all at the same time, you actually aren’t. Spending large amounts of time dedicated to one project is better.Commit to focusing on one project at a time. If you’re worried you will neglect other work, set a timer and put it aside once the buzzer sounds.

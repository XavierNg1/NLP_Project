 After those examples, write down a few lines they said that really evoke the "insane" vibe for your particular character.


Some insane characters may play mind games, seek to manipulate or harm others. In some cases, such as SonozakiÂ  Shion, they may even kill people.
Other insane characters are highly intelligent or creative. For example, think of The Mad Hatter in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. Understand that creativity and insanity often dance very closely together.;
, You never know if an insane character will pop up and really stoke your inspiration.


If possible, watch a recorded role play, perhaps from YouTube or similar video sites online. Study what these characters are doing and the way in which they portray insanity successfully.
 Remember that an insane character is not annoying! If you see a good starting insane character who then becomes annoying, don't use this character as your model.


Some things that can count as being annoying include: Laughing too much, saying constantly stupid things, losing the plot too often, etc. Always be ready to roleplay an insane character with an edge of intelligence and sensitivity.

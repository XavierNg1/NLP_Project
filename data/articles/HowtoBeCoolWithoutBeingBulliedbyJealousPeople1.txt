 Being yourself is trusting in your own worth and not being afraid to express yourself. When you let others see your real self and the fact that you believe in what you're doing and being, other people find this alluring and see it as something to look up to. you are unique, and you don't need to join a clique to validate yourself. Make your own friendships, on your own terms.


Being cool is being yourself in an outgoing way, even if you are quiet. It is not about being sullen or passive/aggressive.
Don't try to be like anyone else. Live life for who you are and what you believe matters. Don't lose sight of yourself or your morals. Being cool isn't about changing who you are, its about being confident enough to let people see how awesome you really are.;

 Each judge rates the dive from 0 ("completely failed") to 10 ("excellent"), using half-point increments. This is based on how well the diver performs, from his starting position to entry into the water. The judges do not take difficulty into account for this score.


Example: a diver receives execution scores of 6.5, 7.0, 7.0, 7.5, 7.5, 8.0, and 8.0.;
, This step depends on how many judges there are:



Seven judges: Cross out the two highest and the two lowest scores.

Five judges: Cross out the highest and lowest scores.

Three judges: Use all three scores.
Example: There were seven judges, so cross out two scores on each end: 6.5, 7.0, 7.0, 7.5, 7.5, 8.0, and 8.0.
 Find the sum of the remaining scores.


Example: 7.0 + 7.5 + 7.5 = 22.0

, Each attempted dive has a degree of difficulty calculated in advance. This is based on many factors, such as the number of twists and somersaults and the take-off and entry positions. Multiply your last sum by the degree of difficulty to get the final score for this dive.


Example: Let's say the diver attempted an inward 2Â½ somersault dive in the 10 meter competition, in the pike position. This has a difficulty score of 2.8. Multiply this by the execution score to get the final score: 22.0 x 2.8 = 61.6.
 Calculate each dive's final score using the same system. To determine an athlete's score for the whole event, add the final score for each dive.


Example: If a diver dives three times with scores of 61.6, 50.9, and 54.3, the diver's score for the event is 61.6+50.9+54.3=166.8.

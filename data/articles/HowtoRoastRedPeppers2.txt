 You can only use your stove to roast red peppers if it isn't electric. This method is ideal if you're just roasting one or two peppers and don't want to spend the time necessary for using your oven.
 You can also use a single layer if you're using heavy duty foil. Just make sure that you've sealed your pepper nice and tight so that no parts of your peppers are directly exposed to the flame.
 Be careful when doing this. Make sure you stay in your kitchen the entire time and don't leave the peppers alone for a minute. You don't want juices from the peppers to get into the flame or for anything unexpected to happen. This method is easy, but it can be a bit messy, so it's important to watch over those peppers and to keep the juices from spilling everywhere.
 Use tongs to turn the pepper a quarter about every 4-5 minutes. This will ensure that the pepper gets a nice, even roast. After the 20-minute mark has passed, you can squeeze the pepper gently to check if it's ready. If it gives easily, it's ready; if it's a bit firm, you can roast it for another few minutes, checking on it every 2-3 minutes until it's ready.
 Let it sit for 15-20 minutes in its foil. It will steam in the foil; this will help the skins get nice and loose and will make them easier to peel.
 Be careful because it might still be hot. Gently use tongs to remove the pepper from the foil. It'll be soft, charred, and almost ready to eat.
 Now, you've got to gently remove those skins, cut those peppers, and use a paper towel or spoon to gently scoop out the seeds. Cut up the peppers as thinly as you like and enjoy them in your favorite foods. They are delicious when covered with a bit of olive oil.

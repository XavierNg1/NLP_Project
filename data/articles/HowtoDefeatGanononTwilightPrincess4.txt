 You're surrounded in a yellow force field with Ganon and you have to fight him one-on-one with your sword. This part can be frustrating at times, but there's a secret to defeating him that most might not know.
 You have to attack Ganon as many times as possible with your sword to kill him. Begin by getting out your fishing rod. Yes. The fishing rod. You're probably wondering "WHY THE HECK WOULD I DO THAT?!" Simple. While having your sword sheathed, "L" or "Z" target Ganon and cast the fishing rod at him. This for some reason distracts his attention away from you, giving you the perfect chance to quickly perform a back slice on him and hit him with your sword. While avoiding his attacks, repeat this process until you've officially defeated Ganon.
 You can attack him with the sword and immediately perform a back-handslice. this will 95% of the time work without Ganon blocking you.
 You've successfully defeated Ganon on Twilight Princess!

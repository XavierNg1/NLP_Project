 For most cars, you can find the VIN in one or more locations:Look on the dashboard, in the far left corner just under the windshield. It is usually easiest to see this from the outside, looking in the windshield.
Look on the front of the engine block. Open the hood and look toward the front of the engine and you should find it on a metal plate.
Look in the rear wheel well on the driver's side. The VIN may be located by looking directly up inside the wheel well.
Look inside the driver's door, either under the side mirror or at the door handle. The VIN may be located either near where the door latches or directly under the side mirror.

 The two leading official sources for the information you need are the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS) and the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB).The NMVTIS has an official, secure web site, http://www.vehiclehistory.gov/, that will search the VIN and let you know if that car has ever been reported as stolen. The NMVTIS search has a fee that ranges from $3 to $15 and gives you a five-point report of the car’s title, prior damage, odometer records, and salvage history.
The NICB also has an official, secure site, https://www.nicb.org/theft_and_fraud_awareness/vincheck/vincheck, to check the car’s history. The NICB search is free, but provides a limited report that only tells you if the car has ever been reported stolen or a “total loss.”, Either search engine will prompt you to enter the VIN for the car you are considering. Be very careful to enter each digit correctly, and then click on “Submit.”

, Very quickly you will receive a report online that will tell you if the car has ever been reported stolen; if it has ever been reported as a “total loss” due to some damage; or if it has ever been reported as “salvaged.”

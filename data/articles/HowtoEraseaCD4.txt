 If possible, choose to do a "Full" erase, rather than a "Quick" erase. After the erase is completed, burn any amount of random insensitive data (such as images, videos, or music that is not private or classified) to the disks full capacity. If you desire, you can erase it again, though the final time is optional.
 Depending on how thorough you require the destruction to be you can achieve this through microwaving the disk (in an old microwave that won't be used for food), and smashing it into tiny pieces. Dispose of it in any way you wish, at this point, recovering any data from the disk would be virtually impossible, even at a facility dedicated to such a task.

 Heat about an inch or two (2.5cm - 5cm) height of oil in a deep frying pan or wok to 350ºF/180ºC. If you don't have a thermometer, heat the oil until you can place a slice of plantain into the pan and it immediately starts bubbling as it fries.;
, This is done by making a shallow cut along one of the lengthwise "ribs" of the plantain and carefully peeling the skin. This is made a little easier if you soak the plantain in hot water for no more than two or three minutes to soften the skin.
, Do not fry them too much; if they turn brown they may not have the right consistency. You want them cooked through, not toasted.
, Add a couple of garlic cloves, a few pieces of pork rind (the idea is to make it a little crackly without overpowering the taste), a tablespoon of olive oil, salt and pepper to taste into the pilón. Mash the mixture again. Alternatively, you can use a food processor with a cutting blade, though the consistency of the finished product will not be the same and may require a bit more olive oil.



If you will be serving it by itself, you're done! Just add to a serving plate along with salad, mains, etc.






If you will be serving it with some type of filling, use your fist or a large spoon to make a concave bowl shape on the rounded side, and place the filling into it.






Enjoy!

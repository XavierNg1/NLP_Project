, Frequent communication is a great thing when it can be managed in a long distance relationship. However, constant communication over the phone alone may tend to drag people down in the long run. It's important to do other things together besides the usual phone call. Just think... people in short-distance relationships do not spend the majority of their time talking, but rather doing things with each other. Try to replicate this by finding things to do together such as watching a TV show or movie simultaneously.
 Don't worry about how he/she will react. It will help the relationship by showing that one can and will take time out of their busy day to talk to the other.
 For instance, you can let your partner be an "alarm clock" for you. Set a time when you need to wake up and tell your partner to give you a call on that certain time of the day. Or let him remind you of your appointment. In this way you can be sure that you are a part of your partner's daily schedule.
 Even though it may sound so redundant to others ears, for a person you love, it is a sweet sound to hear.
 This action will strengthen your trust in each other. Honesty is the best policy, and it plays a very important role in a long distance relationship.
 People flourishing in their social circle, are motivated to do better in their relationship. For more tips go to The Long Distance Relationships website

 At least a month before you intend to sow your seeds, choose a spot in your garden where you will plant the heartsease seeds and turn over the soil. Using a sturdy metal shovel, invert the first layer of earth, digging about ten inches into the soil. Cover the area with a plastic sheet or fleece (available in gardening or hardware stores) to keep the soil warm and prevent weeds., When you are ready to sow the heartsease seeds, remove the covering. Rake the soil to even out the surface and remove weeds and debris. Water the soil so that its moist before you sow the seeds.For best results, sow heartsease seeds in the springtime around April.
 A drill is a shallow depression on the top of the soil in which to sow seeds. Use a long, solid object (e.g. a cane) to gently push down into the first inch or so of the earth. Do not go too deep, as heartsease seeds will have trouble growing if they're too far below the surface., Purchase heartsease seeds from a gardening store, or online. Scatter the seeds every 2-3 inches along the drill. Gently rake earth back into the drill, covering the seeds.Make and sow as many drills as you desire, based on your available space.
 Cover the flower bed with fleece. The germination process usually takes about 16 days. After the 16 days, check up on the growth progress of the heartsease seedlings.Water the seeds during dry spells., After approximately 16 days, or when seedlings have grown to several inches tall, replant them in your flower bed. Using a spade, gently dig up the seedlings. Replant them approximately 6 inches apart, preferably in an area in sun or partial shade.You may also purchase heartsease seedlings from local nurseries or gardening stores to plant.
Heartsease seedlings can also be planted in decorative planters or pots.

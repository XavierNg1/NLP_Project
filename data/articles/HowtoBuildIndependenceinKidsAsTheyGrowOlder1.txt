 Children will become more independent as they get older and learn how to do things for themselves. For example, they will learn how to put on their own clothes, tie their shoes, brush their hair, ride a bike, drive a car, etc. These life skills help them become less dependent on their parents and more self-reliant. In order to teach new skills you need to set aside time.For example, if your child is learning how to dress themselves this means you will need to set aside more time each morning to get ready. Wake up 15 minutes earlier to account for this added time.
You can also set aside practice time for skills such as riding a bike, reading, or driving a car. For instance, set aside 30 minutes each day to learn and practice new skills.;
, It is going to take time for your child to master new skills. Make sure you are patient and do not step in and complete the tasks yourself. Understand that your child is going to need additional time to complete relatively simple tasks. Be supportive and encouraging so that they gain confidence in their own abilities. This will help your child become more independent., You also need to let go of perfection in order to encourage your child to be more independent and do things on their own. For instance, when your child is learning to brush their hair it may not look as nice as when you do it. Do not critique your child because this can make them feel like they have disappointed you. Instead, be supportive and encourage them to continue trying.


You could say “You are doing a great job brushing your hair, I am just going to help you reach the back.”
Alternatively, if you have an older child who is learning to do the dishes they may not get them perfectly clean in the beginning. Instead of nitpicking every spot they miss, you could say "Try using this sponge if you can't get all the food off." This way you are providing them with guidance rather than criticism.

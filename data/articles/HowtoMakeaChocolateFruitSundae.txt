 You will need, fruits(of your choice,we like pears, apples and bananas,and please don't choose juicy fruits like oranges), a bowl, sugar(we like caster or granulated sugar),ice cream(again of your choice) and chocolate chips.;
, Fill enough chocolate chips so you can drizzle them on your sundae. Put them on the stove(we prefer microwave oven) and melt them. If you like the chocolate to be gooey let them be so. But if you like them milky, add a bit of milk and stir.
 Add some scoops of your favorite ice cream to it. Now drizzle the chocolate over it!

, You can add sprinkles, castor sugar, grated coconut, bits of cherry, mint, maybe even tutti fruity( you can get them at a bakery or even a store)

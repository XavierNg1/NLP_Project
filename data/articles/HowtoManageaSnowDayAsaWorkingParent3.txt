 If you need to stay home to watch the kids but still need to work, sticking to your routine as much as possible will help. Of course, watching your children will include some inevitable distractions. To limit these, plan to spend certain hours with them, and set aside other hours to work on specific tasks while they do planned activities.For instance, spend an hour in the morning together outside and then set the kids up with their favorite toys until lunch.
In the afternoon, set them up with some sort of screen entertainment for a few hours in the afternoon while you work some more, and then go outside again for another hour altogether before dinner.
 If you don't have a home office, it's worth establishing one room or table in your home as off-limits for your kids on a snow day. Set up everything you need to work here, and make it clear that you don't want to be bothered during your planned working hours unless necessary.If younger children need to stay close to you, set them up at a nearby table with a task of their own, such as a homework assignment or coloring book.
 If this snow day caught you by surprise, make of point of trying to check the weather in the evening. This is especially important the night of a snow day, because the poor weather may continue into the following day and you may need to plan for another snow day.Another benefit of checking the weather ahead of time is the potential to schedule your work responsibilities accordingly. For instance, if you ever see that the end of the week looks like bad weather, work on your more important assignments early in the week.
 While your initial reaction to the news of a snow day may be frustration, it might help to take a deep breath and remind yourself how quickly your kids are growing up. Yes, it may be a challenge if you fall behind at work, but you may find yourself having a great time at home with your children.

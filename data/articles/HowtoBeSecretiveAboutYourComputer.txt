, A big mistake is to have a simple password, or one people can easily guess at. You should use a more cryptic password, a random hash of numbers and letters would be the best, but hard to memorize. Another good idea would be to write out a sentence for your password. "Gordon ate a fat newt" has no meaning to it, and would be impossible to guess. Do not leave a password hint, you should devote it to memory. If you leave a hint, make it cryptic, or make it seem to point to another password entirely.
 For things of that nature, removable storage is preferable. However, to keep it on the hard drive, put it in a folder called "Projects", in a sub folder in it called "January 2008", in that folder "media", than "movies" and then "corrupted" and then "hot". Remember to password protect all the files, and encrypt them.
 In Firefox, get the Add-on Tab Renamizer, allowing you to rename tabs, so "Hot chicks" becomes "Math Help".
 If someone really wants to snoop, there are ways to find out what's been going on. Get the program "Eraser". It goes to the "empty" space, where all your data waits to be overwritten, and it writes over it with random binary, providing junk information.

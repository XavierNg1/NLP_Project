 Braking quickly makes your car lose any forward momentum you’ve built up while driving. By braking gently and gradually, you may find that a stop light changes to green during your gradual approach, and you don’t need to stop completely at all. This slow and steady approach saves you fuel., Taking off from a full stop and accelerating quickly requires your car move through progressive gears quickly. This uses a lot of gas. Accelerating slowly and more steadily will require less of your car and save you money., Whether you’re distracted by a phone call, music or your kids, distracted driving can cause you to brake abruptly and accelerate quickly. This burns lots of gas and is hard on your car. It can also make you more prone to a costly accident. Try to focus on the task at hand while driving and sideline loud music and phone interruptions.Distracted driving is more than just bad economics. It’s also dangerous. Take the safety of yourself and your passengers into account when you drive by giving the road your full attention.

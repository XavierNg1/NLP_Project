 Stop the curve right above the part where the hair line goes down. Start another curve, smaller, connected to the other one, and make it go down as long as you want the hair.
 Draw another circle of the same length but less in width at the corner of the eye at which side your girl faces. Color in the smaller circle.
 Draw a horizontal that connects to that one. This is the nose.

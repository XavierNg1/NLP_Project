 Three times per day, rate your mood on a scale of one to ten. Consider putting it into a graphing program such as Excel. This way you can see patterns in your mood, and notice if you are getting into a mania or depression.
 Anything could be a trigger for youâ€”from news to holidays to family events. Watch yourself, and learn to notice the signs of a mood swing so you can correct it before it gets out of control.
 Try painting, music, doodling, writing, or whatever works best for you. Art can be very helpful therapy for some people.
 This can be helpful when you want to get things off your chest. Some find that writing in a journal releases the bad feelings and gives them peace; others find the opposite. Try it and see what happens.
 Can you look after yourself and manage your symptoms alone? Would you need to rely upon a family member, or assisted living? What could you realistically accomplish without over-stressing yourself?


Sometimes saying "I can't" is a huge relief. Try it. Allow yourself to seek help, or stop trying the thing altogether. Your health comes first.
 A balanced schedule should have low stress, without causing you to feel bored often. Set times and days to do daily tasks and chores.
 Routine can help provide stability, even if your moods fluctuate. Try giving yourself a rigid daily schedule and adhering to it. For example, vow to spend 8 1/2 hours in bed, and then get up.
 Get at least 8 hours of sleep, fill up 1/3 of your plate with fruits and vegetables, and get a little exercise every day. Try walking, hiking, swimming, or playing backyard sports with friends and loved ones. This will improve your health and keep problems from building upon each other.
 Nature walks can reduce stress. Feel the sunlight on your skin, sit in the shade of a tree, and search for beauty in the world.

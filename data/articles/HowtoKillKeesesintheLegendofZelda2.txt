 You’ll find Keeses hanging upside down on the ceiling. Take a few slow steps towards these creatures and see them wake up and fly.


Unlike in the 2-D version of the Legend of Zelda games, Keeses in the 3-D versions of the game (Majora’s Mask, Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess, Skyward Swords, to name a few) can fly 360 degrees around and will come straight at you instead of just in random directions.
 Just like in 2-D versions, these bats can be taken down using any weapons you have. Equip your sword or whatever weapon of your choice on the Action button of your controller.
 Once the bats start to come at you, press the “Aim” button on your controller to focus the camera view right on the Keeses. Keep pressing down the button to lock your aim.


If you don’t know which button you should press, an on-screen prompt will show on the game screen, notifying you which button on your controller serves as the “Aim.”

, While holding down the Aim button, press the corresponding Action button of the weapon you want to use to kill the Keeses. These bats can be destroyed with just a single blow of your sword.

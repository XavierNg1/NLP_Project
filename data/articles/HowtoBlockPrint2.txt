 Sponges and foam can make excellent print blocks for crafts at home.They work well with water-based as well as acrylic hobby paints to “stamp” simple prints on paper and fabric, but they hold much less surface detail than wood and linoleum.


Different kinds of foam you find around your house, such as Styrofoam, can work to make simple outline stamps. However, the denser, specially made “foamcore” available at craft stores will hold noticeably more surface detail and last much longer.
 Because these materials will be used mainly as stamps, the outline of the shape is the most important part of the design.


If you are using a flat foam block, such as a Styrofoam plate, you can draw a design on paper and trace it heavily with a stylus to “transfer” the image onto the foam., Using a pair of scissors or a craft knife, cut the shape out of the sponge or block of foam. The resulting shape will be your printing stamp.


Always cut away from your body and fingers!
Foam plates can be etched with images and printed on paper easily without making a “block” or “stamp” at all., Mix up the color and consistency of the paint you want to use on a palette or mixing slate. Make sure there is enough room in the container to fit your stamp.
 After wiping off any excess paint from the stamp, simply press the block down on your medium. Depending on how absorbent the material is, you may be able to get a few printings from each application of paint.

 This is an absolutely brilliant plan. First, pick a time when your brother doesn't think you're home and nobody else is there. Then, hide in a closet far away from he is, maybe your own. Then, quietly call the house from your cell phone. When your brother answers the phone, tell him that you need him to go to your closet (or whatever closet you're in) to check on something for you. Then, when he opens the closet, spring out at him and say, "boo!" He'll never expect to see you there and will freak out! You'll be able to hold this one against him for years.;
, The first sentence says it all. Find a big cardboard box that you can climb inside that closes up top, place it on your front porch, and then ring the doorbell and jump inside the box, making sure to quickly close it over yourself. When your brother opens the door and approaches the box, you can jump out! This is guaranteed to make him scream. It works best if you ring the doorbell when he's a bit away from the door, so he doesn't answer it too soon and see you climbing into the box.


If you can't find any big cardboard boxes around the house, then you can get some at your local grocery store. Just ask one of the employees -- many grocery stores often give away their extra boxes.
 Wait until he's so obsessed with what's going on with his computer that he completely doesn't notice who else is in the room. If you can do this at night, when most of the lights in his room are out, then even better. Put on a creepy clown, Scream, or Jason mask and slowly creep up to him until you're practically breathing down his neck. Then, release a guttural, terrifying howl, and watch him jump five feet in the air.


If you have another friend or sibling who is as quiet as a mouse, he or she can film the whole thing for effect, and you can use it as blackmail.

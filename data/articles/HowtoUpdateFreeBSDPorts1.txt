Only the root user can update, or install things from ports.
 If this is a new install and you have not updated ports before, type "portsnap fetch extract" and it'll fetch the latest snapshot of ports and extract it to the proper directory.


If this is after the first time you've updated ports, as well as to update ports in the future after doing the first update. Type "portsnap fetch update" to update ports.
To update the applications on the machine, it would be a good idea to install from ports either "port master" or "port-up-grade."

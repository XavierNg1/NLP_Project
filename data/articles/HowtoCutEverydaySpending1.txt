 It can be convenient to stop by a local coffee shop on your way to the bus or train every morning. However, the few dollars you spend on coffee add up over time. It's actually much more economical to take coffee from home to work or school in a thermos., If you eat out for your lunch each day, you're spending unnecessarily. Instead of running to a nearby restaurant during your lunch break, pack your lunch each day. Not only will this save you money, homemade lunches are often healthier and lower in calories.If you have co-workers, get a group together. You can all agree to start packing your own lunches and eating together in the break room. This will make packing lunch a fun social event.
 You would be surprised how much you're spending dining out. Try to limit dining out for special occasions, like a good friend's birthday. Most days of the week, prepare meals for yourself at home.If you're going out with friends, eat first so you won't be tempted to splurge on food later in the night.

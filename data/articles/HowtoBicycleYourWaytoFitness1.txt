 A health professional will be able to determine whether your current physical injuries or your medical history may contraindicate bicycling as a fitness strategy.


Unless you have trouble with your knees or a problem with vertigo, bicycling may be appropriate for fitness and weight management goals. If you do suffer from balance problems, using a stationary bike may resolve the issue, though extra caution will still be advisable.;
, If you are hoping to achieve significant upper body strength and toning, bicycling will probably need to be combined with other exercises. However, if your goal is low-impact cardio fitness, weight loss, a toned core, and a strong lower body, then bicycling will likely meet your fitness needs.
 Depending on the climate of your region, your financial ability to purchase a high-quality bicycle or gym membership, and your preferences for the type of biking you would like to do, your needs will change.

Road bikes and mountain bikes serve different purposes and will allow you to cover different types of terrain with varying degrees of ease. If you anticipate primarily riding in your neighborhood or on paved roads or trails, purchase a road bike. If you anticipate climbing hills or biking on rough trails, a mountain bike will be more appropriate.






If the weather or climate of your region does not permit outdoor cycling year-round, you may wish to invest in a stationary bike for your home, a gym membership for a facility that has multiple stationary bikes, or a piece of equipment that you can mount your regular bicycle to in order to cycle indoors without a regular stationary bike.

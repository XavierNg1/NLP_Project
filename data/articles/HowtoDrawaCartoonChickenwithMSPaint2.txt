This will be your chicken’s body base.
,


This will be for the shading. If you’re using white for the chicken’s feather, use gray or light blue for the shadow.
I used brown for the primary color and dark brown to the secondary color.



This will make it add more depth to the drawing.

For the wings, make a heart shape similar to the tail. Use the shadow color for this step.
Using the rotate tool, make rotate so that the pointed part of the heart points towards the head.



Rotate it the same way you did for the previous step.
,


This time, use dark red.
For the wattle, I used a single heart flipped horizontally.
For the comb, I used 3 hearts. I added 2 short hearts side-by-side and a tall heart in the middle.



Adjust the size of the red wattles and comb so that some dark red streaks are visible

,


For the eyes, I drew some circles with the shape tool with my colors on Black and white.
For the beak, I used the diamond shape on the shape tool. I used a darker shade of orange.



Using the triangle with the color set to yellow, I added the upper beak.
I used the rectangle tool.



Using the rectangle tool, I added two claws for the feet.



I used the thought bubble shape tool to add some feathers on the chicken’s body.
Flip it horizontally so that the circles are pointing upwards.
Use the shadow color when doing this.



This time, using the original feather color.

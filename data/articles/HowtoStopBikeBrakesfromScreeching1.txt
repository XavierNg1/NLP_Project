 Most mountain bikes and some other bikes use disc brakes, located at the hub. To get full access to its parts, remove the wheel. In most cases, this is as simple as turning the quick release handle outward and lifting the wheel away.


Never activate the brakes while the wheel is removed. The brake pads will move inward and make it very difficult to reinsert the wheel.;
, These parts are usually held in the calipers by a screw or cotter pin, which you can unbend with needle-nose pliers. There may be additional clips holding in the pads.Disc brake designs vary. If you can't figure out how to disassemble yours, track down a user manual.
Try not to touch the braking surface of the pads or rotors with your hands, especially after cleaning them.
 Disc brake pads usually need replacement once they've worn down to 1 mm thick, but you may want to confirm that with the manufacturer instructions.If your pads aren't worn enough to require replacement, try the solutions below instead.
 Grease on the brakes is one of the most common causes of squeaking. Wipe the braking surface of the pads and rotors with rubbing alcohol to dissolve dirt and grease.


You may use warm water and dish soap instead, but this is less effective.
 Brand new pads are usually glossy and hard. These tend to squeak until you've worn them in. To speed up this process, lightly scuff the surface of the pad with sandpaper.
 Place the pads back in the disc brakes. Fasten the wheel back onto the bike. Double check that all bolts are tight, as loose attachments are another cause of squeaking and poor braking.


Wet brake pads may screech. Let the alcohol evaporate before reassembly.

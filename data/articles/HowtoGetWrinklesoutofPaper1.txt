 While you probably won’t be able to remove all of the wrinkles, you may be able to work out some of the creases and folds just by running your hand over it. It’s important to be gentle, though, because you may rip the paper if you use too much force. The goal is to flatten it, so it’s as smooth as possible., Your hand may not be able to smooth all of the wrinkles from the paper, but a significant weight can often press out the creases and folds. Look for items around the house that are fairly heavy, such as thick books, pots and pans, or even bricks. Choose objects that are as large or larger than the paper to ensure that the entire surface is covered.You don’t necessarily need one extremely heavy object. Try stacking several smaller objects on top of one another to create a significant weight.
 You’ll want to set the page on a flat surface, and make sure that it is as smooth as possible before setting your objects on top. Check that the entire sheet of paper is covered, so all of the wrinkles can be smoothed. If your heavy object isn’t large enough to cover the paper, place two or more side by side to ensure that the full surface is weighted down.Depending on the items that you’re using as weights, it may be a good idea to throw a towel over the paper before placing the objects on top to prevent it from getting dirty.
 It takes time for the weight of your objects to press out the wrinkles, so you need to let them sit for a while. The amount of time necessary depends on how wrinkled the paper is and how heavy the objects on top are, but the longer you let it sit, the better. Typically, you’ll want to wait at least 24 hours.In most cases, using weight alone isn’t enough to completely smooth all of the wrinkles out of a sheet of paper. However, it can help get rid of some of the creases before you move onto one of the other methods.

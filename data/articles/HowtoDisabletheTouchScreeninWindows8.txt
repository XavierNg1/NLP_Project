A new window appears. Just click on “Control Panel” at the bottom left of the screen.


Click on “Category” on the top right of the Control Panel and select “Large icons” or “Small icons”.
You are now able to access the many settings of the Control Panel. The one you need is “Device Manager”––click on it. A window with all the devices of your machine will appear. Note that it may take a few minutes. The image accompanying this step is what the window looks like.
,, Just deactivate it, do not uninstall it.

Be careful, if you want to remove the touch screen temporarily and you think this may be useful for you later, then deactivate it.

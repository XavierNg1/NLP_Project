 Your baby's suckling is what triggers your body to produce milk.Also, babies tend to suckle harder when they first start feeding; therefore, if your baby suckles on the smaller breast first when you feed them, it can help trigger milk flow in that breast, helping to balance out the size of your breasts.


This solution only works if one breast is producing normally while the other is under producing. If one is overproducing, you may need to drain the milk off to prevent engorgement. Hand-express the overproducing breast for no more than 20 to 30 seconds.Another option is to nurse more often on the smaller side than the larger side.;
, Once your baby eats, try pumping for 10 minutes or so afterwards. In addition, you can try pumping just this side between the times you feed your baby., Sometimes, a preference for one side or the other means your baby doesn't feel right in a certain position. That discomfort could indicate an illness for your baby, such as an ear infection, or a treatable condition called torticollis. If you notice your baby always fusses unless they are on one side, take them to the doctor to have them checked out., That is, your breasts being different sizes doesn't indicate anything is wrong health-wise, unless other symptoms are present. In fact, many women produce different amounts of milk in each breast, leading to different sizes. You can even only feed on one breast if you need to do so, and your other breast will slowly regain the size it was before you got pregnant.

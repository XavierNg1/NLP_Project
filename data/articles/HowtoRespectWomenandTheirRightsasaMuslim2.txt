 She helps take care of her baby and fulfills her responsibilitiesâ€”being a good wife, mother, and daughter-in-law. She has spent many years raising you and teaching you, caring for the household, providing for the family, or both.


The Quran emphasizes the great struggles the mother goes through for her child, to highlight the need for one to reciprocate their parents sacrifice for them: "And We have enjoined on man to his parents: in travail upon travail did his mother bear him and his weaning was over two years. Be thankful to Me and to your parents, unto Me is the final destination."

, A mother has to go through the problems of pregnancy and severe pains of delivery. The father doesn't suffer from any of these difficulties, that is why the Prophet (peace be upon him) has given more rights to the mother than anybody else. According to narration;


"And We have enjoined upon man, to his parents, good treatment. His mother carried him with hardship and gave birth to him with hardship, and his gestation and weaning period is thirty months until, when he reaches maturity and reaches forty years, he says, "My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to work righteousness of which You will approve and make righteous for me my offspring. Indeed, I have repented to You, and indeed, I am of the Muslims."
"Do good to and serve your mother, then your mother, then your mother, then your father, then the near relatives and then those who come after them."

, If she asks for help washing dishes or cleaning the house, go help her. Offer to run errands, watch your siblings, and take care of other chores. This will give her more time to rest and focus on her biggest responsibilities

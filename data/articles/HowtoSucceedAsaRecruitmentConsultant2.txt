 No matter how good the contractor looks on paper, you will need to keep your eyes out for certain flaws.


Look out for serial job leavers/hoppers. Despite the fact that the candidate may possess great experience and excellent interviewing skills, look for regular job hopping. Try to find gaps in employment, valid reasons and any employment history that they are not listing on their resume.
Always look out for location and salary problems. No matter how good a candidate seems, a job with a big commute or in another city is unlikely to work out well. Listen thoroughly when you ask a candidate where they are looking to work and the salary range they will accept. It is very hard to place a candidate when these elements are not met.
Find out all the reasons a contractor left previous jobs. Try to encourage them to be honest about any bad blood or failures in their past. You should know if your contractor fails to work well with team members, or if it was simply a bad fit.
Keep an eye out for a good fit with company culture. Ask your candidates about their interests, hobbies, family and favorite sports. While keeping the conversation professional, you should be able to analyze how well they will work with a company's team.
 Include necessary skills, qualifications, experience, career path and education, as well as concrete details like location, salary range, opening and closing dates and interview specifications. An artfully written and honest job description will set you apart from other recruiters.
 Good relationships with other consultants will put you in good stead. If you find yourself low on contractors, ask your fellow consultant to look at a "trade," where they are able to fill a position for you and you can do the same for them.

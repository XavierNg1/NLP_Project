 Either on an Android device or on a computer, launch your favorite web browser and go to Google.com.;
, Look for the special codes for accessing service mode on your Android device. Use keywords like “Galaxy S5 Service Menu Code,” where you place your mobile network carrier between the brackets.
 Once you see the code, write it on good old pen and paper. This helps you remember the codes while having them handy when you forget it.
 If you were using your phone to search for the code, hit the Home button on your device to go back to the home screen.
 On the home screen or app drawer, tap the stock Phone app of your device.


The codes may not work on third-party dialers.
 Tap the dialing field near the top of the screen to display the numeric pad, and then type in the code for your phone model and carrier.
 The Phone app may crash after tapping the dial icon; this is normal. You should see some info regarding your device, like the GSM status, Cell ID, IMEI Certification status, and so forth. On some devices, like the Galaxy S3, you will see buttons labeled with the names according to what function they will test.


You can now choose a tool by tapping on the button for the respective tool labeled along the screen to help diagnose problems regarding the phone.

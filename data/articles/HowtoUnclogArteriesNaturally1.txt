 Saturated fat is one of the primary culprits in raising your cholesterol.You should equally avoid trans fats, which appear on food labels as “hydrogenated” oils and fats.Butter, margarine, cheese, full-fat dairy products, red meat, and processed meats are a few examples where you can expect to find excessive levels of these fats.Check saturated fat levels on food labels, and limit your daily caloric intake to only five or six percent (13 grams in a 2,000-calorie/day diet, for instance).;
, Since butter, lard, and margarine are all high in unhealthy fats, you should choose healthier cooking oils when preparing food. Some alternatives are high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which can actually have the opposite effect and help reduce cholesterol levels and reduce inflammation associated with atherosclerosis.These options include:Olive oil
Canola oil
Peanut oil
Sesame oil
Palm and coconut oils can be used in limited quantities. These contain medium-chain triglycerides, which may decrease triglyceride cholesterol levels and raise HDL (healthy) cholesterol. They pack a lot of calories, however, so use in moderation., Omega-3 fats (so-called “good” fats) help to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis.You can find these fats in many foods and especially fish. Salmon, tuna, and trout are all excellent sources of these fats, so try to eat around two servings a week.Other foods rich in omega-3 fats include:Flaxseeds and flaxseed oil
Walnuts
Chia seeds
Soy products and tofu
Legumes
Leafy green vegetables
Avocados

, Processed grains cut out the fiber and other healthy components found in grains. Instead of foods made with white flour (white rice, white bread, semolina pasta, etc.), choose whole grain options.You should try to eat three servings of whole grain options each day.These include whole wheat pasta, quinoa, brown rice, oats, nine-grain breads, etc., Sweets are a major source of simple carbohydrates, which can have an impact of several factors related to atherosclerosis such as high blood pressure and obesity. You should eliminate sugary foods and drinks from your diet to help promote heart health.You should limit yourself to a maximum and five sugary items a week (and fewer when you can)., High-fiber foods help to control both cholesterol and blood sugar levels.Add lots of fruits, vegetables, and legumes to your diet to increase fiber. Some of the best options include:Beans
Apples
Citrus fruits
Oats and barley
Nuts
Cauliflower
Green beans
Potatoes
Carrots
Generally speaking, try to eat 21 to 25 grams of fiber a day if you’re a woman and 30 to 38 grams each day if you’re a man., Sodium (found in salt) has an impact on your blood pressure, and high blood pressure also puts you at a higher risk for artery hardening and damage. Choose low-sodium options at the store and restaurants and limit your intake to a maximum of 2,300 mg a day.If your doctor has already diagnosed you with high blood pressure, then you should set even stricter limits around 1,500 mg daily.

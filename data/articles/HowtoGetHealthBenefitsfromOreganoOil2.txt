 Oregano oil has some anecdotal evidence for treating acne, athlete's foot, oily skin, dandruff, rosacea, warts, and insect bites., Depending on the concentration of the oregano oil you have purchased, you may need to mix the oil with different amounts of other oils before applying it to the skin.
 If you have full strength oregano oil, mix 1 drop of oregano oil with a single teaspoon of a mild, food-grade oil such as olive oil or coconut oil.


If you need enough oil to cover a larger skin area, maintain the 1 drop oregano and 1 teaspoon other oil ratio for the entire mixture.
 If your infection or problem persists and shows only mild improvement, up the application (of diluted oregano oil) to 2 or 3 times per day.


If there is no improvement after 2 weeks or if symptoms worsen, discontinue use of the oil and consult a health professional. The nature of your skin problem may not be able to be treated effectively by oregano oil.

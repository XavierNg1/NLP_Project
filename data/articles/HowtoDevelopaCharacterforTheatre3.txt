 Before entering the stage, really think about where you have been before your entrance. This will help you channel genuine emotions and reactions once you get on stage. Then practice different stage entrances to see which one fits the scene best.For example, if you were supposed to be at the shopping mall before your entrance, think about how your shopping experience went. Did you find everything you were looking for? Are you tired from shopping? Did you run into an old friend or ex-boyfriend at the mall? Asking questions like these will help you set up an appropriate demeanor for your stage entrance.
 Take risks by trying different movements and positions on stage. See which ones fit your character and which ones donâ€™t. Use rehearsal time to do this. Remember that you can always tweak your movements or exchange them for something different.For example, run around, jump on objects, fall down, cry or laugh until your stomach hurts. The main idea is to take risks to see what works and what does not.
 Instead of just reciting your lines, listen and pay attention to the lines of the characters that are speaking before and after you. This way, when it is time for your lines, you can speak and respond to the other characters in a more genuine and sincere way.

, Using this code will lock your game mode to Survival, so that when you switch to Creative later on, it will stay on Survival.
 Go to your files and type in %appdata% . You will see a list of files––click on the one that says .minecraft, then open it. Inside, scroll down to the file saves. This is where all your worlds are saved. Open the file.
 The next bit is hard, so you'll have to do this carefully. Open Player Data and open your account with notepad++ (you'll have to download that). Copy and paste this file in the code: playerdata.abl.breaktrue.collecttrue.itemlossfalse.survivaltrue.game

, Then, open Minecraft and go to the world you were just on. You can break stuff instantly, just as on Creative even though you're on Survival. When you break blocks, you won't lose them; they will go into your inventory. Brilliant!

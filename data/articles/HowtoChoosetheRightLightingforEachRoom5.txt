 Bathroom lighting is probably the last place people want to invest time and money. Mirrors go unlit, and oftentimes one ceiling fixture is used to light up the sink, mirror, and shower. However, as whirlpool tubs become larger and steam showers are added, more and more time is spent relaxing in the bathroom. Since you begin and end your day in the bathroom, why not spend a little extra time considering which fixtures and lights would work best?


Halogen bulbs are generally the standard for bathroom lighting, but the newest compact fluorescent bulbs are also a great option.

 If using recessed lighting, avoid creating shadows by not mounting them directly over the mirror.


Adding wall brackets to the side of the mirror is one of the best way to eliminate shadows on the face. For mirrors under 48" wide use, vertically mounted wall brackets and position them 75 to 80 inches (190.5 to 203.2Â cm) above the floor.
If the fixture uses exposed lamps, do not use a higher wattage than 40 watts. Fixtures with clear or well diffused glass use nor more than 75 watts. Color corrected fluorescent lamps should be used when fluorescent fixtures are desired. A crisp white light renders skin tones most accurately.
 Try a small recessed light directed at a piece of decorative art work or a beautiful powder basin creates an extra layer of lighting.


In the shower, use recessed lights or a ceiling mounted plastic unit. Angle a recessed shower fixture and highlight nice tile work or make your shower fixtures sparkle.
Don't forget the area over the commode! A recessed unit is always a great addition.

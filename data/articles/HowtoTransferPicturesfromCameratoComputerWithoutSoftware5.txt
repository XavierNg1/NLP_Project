 This may well be the simplest and fastest way to move your images from camera to computer. With iCloud, your iOS camera's photos are automatically uploaded to the cloud, and distributed to all your iCloud-enabled devices, be they Mac or PC.
 When you get home, access your Photo Stream with iPhoto or Aperture, or any other device that recognizes Photo Stream.

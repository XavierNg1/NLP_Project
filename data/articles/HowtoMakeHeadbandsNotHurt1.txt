, These can get tangled into your hair, and they can be extremely difficult to get out without a lot of pain. They can also cause hair breakage or loss in extreme cases.
 These, with prongs or not, can hurt a lot. Wearing them for long amounts of time can cause headaches and a lot of pain. Sometimes they can even pull your hair during removing them.
 These are the best kinds of headbands, as they cause no headaches, no hair loss, and no pain. You can wear them for a long time without fear of them coming off.
 This can cause them to slip off of your head and cause your hair to move around at the worst times.

, At this point, you may be alarmed at the gloppy consistency of the flour and milk mixture, but don't despair! As you continue to mix the dough, it will slowly become smooth and supple like bread dough, and also tough and difficult to knead. All of this is completely normal, so continue the workout! The total kneading time is 20 minutes.
 Now, the dough needs to rest for 30 minutes in a bowl. The chemical leavening agents in the flour mixture will cause the dough to rise slightly.
 If you prefer smaller buns, cut each ball of dough in half so you end up with 24 total.
 Make sure that the edges are much thinner than the middle section of the dough because this will make sealing the buns easier and also create a substantial section of bread in the finished bun.


A small rolling pin works best for this procedure, not the larger ones with which your mom may have chased you around the house as a child. If you don't have one, an alternate method is to simply flatten each ball of dough with a broad bottomed glass, pressing firmly and then shaping the dough with your hands.
 Remember, less is better!

, Do this by bringing up one side over the top of the red bean paste, and then another side, and then another until the paste is completely covered. Press the pieces of dough together and twist with your fingers to seal it completely.


To make the dough more cohesive while sealing, wet the outer periphery of each disc with water. Don't use too much water, though, as this will interfere with the texture of the bread and create a distasteful gummy spot after steaming.
 How many batches you have will depend on how large you made your buns. Smaller buns can be steamed in three batches.
 Remove lid and steam for another 10 minutes.
 Enjoy!

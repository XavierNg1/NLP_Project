 The atomic number appears in the upper left-hand corner, above the element symbol in the square on the periodic table. The atomic number defines the number of protons present in that particular element.Protons are the particles in an element that provide a positive charge. Because electrons are negatively charged, when an element is in its neutral state, it will have the same number of protons as electrons.


For instance, boron (B) has an atomic number of 5, meaning that it has 5 protons and 5 electrons.
 Adding and removing electrons from an atom does not change its identity, but it changes its charge. In these cases, you now have an ion, such as K+, Ca2+, or N3-. Usually, the charge is expressed in a superscript to the right of the atom abbreviation.


Because an electron has a negative charge, when you add extra electrons, the ion is more negative.
When you remove electrons, the ion becomes more positive.
For example, N3- has a -3 charge while Ca2+ has a +2 charge.
 If the charge is positive, the ion has lost electrons. To determine how many electrons are left, subtract the amount of charge from the atomic number. In this case, there are more protons than electrons.


For example, Ca2+ has a +2 charge therefore it has 2 fewer electrons than a neutral calcium atom. Calcium’s atomic number is 20, therefore this ion has 18 electrons.
 If the charge is negative, the ion has gained electrons. To determine how many total electrons there are, add the amount of charge to the atomic number. In this case, there are fewer protons than electrons.


For example, N3- has a -3 charge which means it has 3 more electrons than a neutral nitrogen atom. Nitrogen’s atomic number is 7, therefore this ion has 10 electrons.

 Use your TV remote to make sure that the correct input has been selected. The button on the remote will often say "Source" or "Input", and when the correct channel is pressed, you should see an your TV display an image from your Dish receiver (if it's turned on).


For older dish remotes, check the next section.
 You may have to open one of the front panels to expose the button. You'll see the System Information screen on your TV if the correct input is selected.
 You should be able to find this in the upper-left corner. The SAT button will illuminate after being pressed, and you should hear several beeps. At this point, your TV remote will begin picking up signals sent out by your TV, allowing the two to be paired.
 You can find this to the right of the arrow buttons. This will close the System Information screen.
 Your remote is now ready to use with your Hopper, Joey, or 922 receiver.

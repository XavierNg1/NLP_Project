, Most toll roads have the toll road operator's phone number on the side of the road. It is imperative you ring them within 48 hours to avoid a fine notice.
 Some toll roads will allow you to purchase a pass up to 48 to 72 hours after travelling. Purchasing a pass will ensure you do not receive a fine.
 If you do not purchase a pass or arrange payment with the toll road operator, you will receive an invoice in the mail, which will be the amount of the toll, and a processing fee. If you do not pay this initial invoice, the matter is usually referred to the police / relevant state authority, where costs will escalate and criminal charges may be pursued.

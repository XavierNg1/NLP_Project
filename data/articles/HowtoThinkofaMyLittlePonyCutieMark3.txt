 Some approaches you might like to use include:


Use social media to ask others for opinions.
Look up a random word and see what it means. Use a thesaurus to find other relevant words.
Look up an interesting flower, tree or leaf.
Choose what interests you from online inspirations and incorporate the inspirations into your design.
 Notice everything, just look as there may be inspirations such as:


Maybe the nest of birds that eggs just recently hatched.
The falling blossom that landed on your hand.
The swaying trees in the strong wind.
The new buds sprouting from the ground.
The little squirrel that ran up the tree.
The rosy red apple on the apple tree.



Ask your parents or guardians––they might have the perfect idea.
Ask a brony, they might have an excellent idea.
Ask friends, as they might know a good idea too.

 If you already have ginger hair great.


Wear your hair in a short bob style like Ron's.

Wear a robe for the school look. For your school uniform,opt to have it messy with some of your shirt not tucked in your pants and roll up your sleeves.






Keep casual. You may prefer to wear a sweater - make sure it looks very homemade and lumpy. If you can, add a big "R" to the sweater. Also wear jeans and tennis shoes. Again, this is part of Ron's casual look.



Friendship is very important to Ron. Ron and Harry have been friends forever and always will be. If they fight, Ron doesn't apologize unless he really wants his friend back.
 Some examples of how Ron is include:


Have a don't care aura if something bothers you. This is really Ron-like.
Have something funny to say most of the time. If the people around you are sad or depressed, find something that amuses them. Try not to use jokes from websites. Try to make some up on your own. Some people have a natural sense of humor, which is great.
Be afraid of spiders. Ron is deadly scared of spiders. He finds them gross and scary. If spiders don't already scare you, try to be scared. Ron says spiders are "disgusting".
Don't be emotionally expressive. Ron doesn't let his feelings out easily. If he has a crush on someone, he just looks at her from afar and makes jokes. Ron finds jokes way more fun than flirting.

 As with a normal push-up, it is important to keep your spine straight during this exercise to prevent injury. Poor posture can harm your shoulder joint.
 You should not move your hands while rising or lowering in this exercise. Keep your hands planted beneath your shoulders at all times. Do not flare your elbows out to the sides., Squeezing your glutes (or butt muscles) has a number of benefits both for your performance and health. It can protect your lower back during exercise while strengthening your posture. It can also help you keep a neutral spine.As you rise in a reverse push-up, squeeze your glutes together. Release after you have lowered yourself to the starting position.
 It is important to breathe as you exercise, and proper breathing technique will improve your performance over all. Inhale as you lower yourself and exhale as you raise yourself. Do not hold your breath., While you may want to go quickly to increase your reps, it is more effective to practice slower movements. By going slowly, you can work out more muscles than by rushing through the exercise. It also helps you concentrate on your form.

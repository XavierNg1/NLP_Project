 The people of Amity wear clothing that is generally bright and pleasant. Amity members are most often seen in red and/or yellow. Also, Amity's dress code is less formal than in the other factions.;
, Most all members of Amity are creative. They love music and the arts. So, spend your free time painting or writing a song!

, Don't be violent (like the Dauntless). When you see two people fighting, step in and act as a mediator. And, if you're ever involved in a fight, talk it out instead of throwing punches. Amity also thinks that it's okay to lie to maintain peace.
 If you are Amity, you should trust that what you need will be provided for you, instead of arguing about who gets what.
 When someone insults you, don't be changed by it. The insult didn't change who you were on the inside, did it? The opinions of others cannot damage you.
 When someone apologizes to you, forgive them. The wrong is in the past. Let it rest where it lies.
 You shouldn't fight with your enemy. Cruel thoughts lead to cruel words. And cruel words can hurt you as much as they hurt others.
 Amity was formed by the people who blamed conflict and hatred for the wars and problems of the world. And, Amity still believes that conflict and hatred are the reason for the world's problems today!

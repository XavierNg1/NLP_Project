Choose a sunny, warm day/weekend. People walk their dogs on sunny days, so they'll walk right over to you!
Don't plan on a holiday. People could be out of town, and that's losing customers!
Don't have it on a weekday, either. People are going to be tired from working, and not have much free time.;
, A park or a school might work, if you can get permission, but if not, your yard or drive-way will probably fit the bill.
Try to use a grassy area, so pets won't hurt their feet.



Put up flyers and make posters, in advance, so people know ahead of time.
Tell your friends! And ask them to spread the word.
Think about a gimmick to get more attention. Maybe you could have a mascot? Or maybe dress up as dogs. Get creative!

Buy hypo-allergenic dog shampoo/soap. (Oatmeal dog shampoo is cheap, smells good, and works well. )
Have large buckets/containers ready (dog-sized). You'll need one for cleaning, and one for rinsing.
Have running, fresh water. Hose-water works well. Needed for re-filling buckets and for water bowls! Doggies get thirsty.
Have lots of towels, and some type of clothes line or string from tree to tree, so they can dry and be reused.
Dog treats! After getting cleaned and dried, those doggies will probably be tired! They deserve a nice reward. (It's best to bring the box the treats came in, so the owners can check for anything their dog's allergic to. )

, Don't try to handle the job alone - most dogs will require handling by multiple people.


Have at least two people. When cleaning, one person needs to keep the dog calm, and the other, clean the dog.
Be happy! People tip cheerful people.

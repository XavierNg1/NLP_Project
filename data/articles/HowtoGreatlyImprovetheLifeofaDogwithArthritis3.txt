 Dogs love companionship. Quality time with your dog will be very important, especially now that arthritis has made physical activity a little more difficult. Some ideas for quality time include:Petting your dog when they are in their bed
Reading a book with your dog when they are on the couch with you
Gently rolling a ball that your dog can easily retrieve

, Doggie wheelchairs are great for dogs that cannot use their back legs due to severe arthritis or other orthopedic injuries. The wheelchair will prop up your dog’s backend, making walking a little easier. Having the confidence to walk will improve your dog’s life and help them enjoy their daily walks.Ask your vet for recommendations on doggie wheelchair brands.
Your vet can also help you learn how to put your dog’s back end in the wheelchair.
 What better way to spend time with your dog than to give them a massage! Gentle massage will not only relax your dog, but also improve blood flow around their stiff and painful joints.Prepare the massage area by placing a few layers of comfortable blankets on the floor and turning on some soft music.Apply light pressure around the joints so your dog doesn’t stiffen with pain or discomfort during the massage.
Talk quietly to your dog during the massage.
Move your hands in slow back-and-forth or circular motions on your dog’s body.
 Physical therapy will help relieve your dog’s pain and improve their flexibility, allowing them to have better quality of life. Perform passive range of motion (PROM) exercises at home. For these exercises, you will gently take each joint through its natural of motion while your dog rests comfortably.Depending on the joints that are affected with arthritis, your vet can show you how to perform the PROM exercises.
Using direct heat on the affected joints can also help your dog feel better. Wrap hot packs, which you can purchase at your local pharmacy, in a towel and place them on the painful joints.

 This method works best for woven placemats, but you can use fabric ones as well. Make sure that the material is thin and flexible enough to be folded without breaking., You should end up with a vertical "pill" shape., Hot glue will set the fastest, but you can also use fabric glue. Focus the glue on the edges of the flaps. If you need to, place a heavy book on top of the flaps until the glue sets. Do not glue the upper part of the flaps down., This will give you a crisp corner and make your clutch look more professional. Place clips over the corners until the glue sets., Use your bull clips to keep the clutch together., Working one side at a time, remove the bull clip, and glue the bottom flap down, focusing on the edges. Replace the bull clip, and do the other side.

You can remove the clips once the glue has dried or set.
 You can use a self-adhesive Velcro square, or use hot glue (or fabric glue) to attach a regular one. Find the corresponding spot on the body of your clutch, and attach the matching Velcro square.

For a more professional clutch, use a magnetic clasp instead. Follow the instructions on the package that came with your clasp.
 Glue some tassel or fringe trim all along the curved edge of the top flap. Close the top flat, and continue gluing down other types of trim. Feel free to mix and match; you can have one row or many. For a truly unique touch, combine pompom trim with braided cord trim. Use bright colors that contrast with your placemat.

 Pour water into the saucepan as well, using just enough to completely cover the raisins.


Water works well as a default option, but for something more flavorful, experiment with other liquids. For instance, consider trying grape juice, orange juice, or another fruit juice. For more mature palettes, consider a little diluted wine or rum.;
, Place the saucepan on the stove over high heat. Heat it until the liquid starts to boil, then immediately remove the saucepan from the heat source.
 Cover the saucepan with an appropriately sized lid and set it aside in a room temperature spot. Allow the raisins to soak in the hot liquid for a full 5 minutes.
 Pour any excess liquid out of the pan or remove the raisins from the pan using a slotted spoon. Regardless of how you accomplish it, you simply need to remove the plumped raisins from the liquid.


You could drain the liquid by pouring the contents of the pan through a small colander. Alternatively, place the lid on the pan, leaving a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) gap between the pan and the lid on one side. Pour the liquid out through this gap, carefully preventing the raisins from slipping through.
If you need the raisins to be somewhat dry after you plump them up, spread them out onto a couple layers of clean paper towels. The paper towels should absorb some of the excess liquid.
 The raisins should be plump and ready to enjoy at this point.

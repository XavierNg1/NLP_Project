 If you fall asleep often after eating sweets, it could be a sign you need to cut back on how often you consume sugar. Try to keep your daily sugar intake within respected dietary guidelines. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends that only 10% of a personâ€™s total daily calories come from sugar. For example, a 2000 calorie diet should contain no more than 200 calories from sugar each day.Try replacing sugary drinks with water.
You can also replace sweet snacks with low-sugar fruit, like berries.
 A lot of processed foods contain high amounts of sugar. Foods like salad dressing or yogurt can contain surprising amounts of added sugars, thwarting your best efforts to cut back on sugar. Read food labels carefully and be on the look out for added sugars like:Brown sugar
Corn sweetener
Corn syrup
Dextrose
Fructose
Glucose
High-fructose corn syrup
Honey
Lactose
Malt syrup
Maltose
Molasses

, If you feel sleepy after eating sweets, it could be a sign of underlying medical issues. If you have consistent trouble staying awake after eating sugar, make an appointment to see your doctor. They can perform tests to see if your blood sugar is normal, and can help you figure out ways to cut back on sugar in your diet.

 If you are working with especially thick breasts, it will make your job easier if you cut them before flattening them. Using a sharp knife, cut them horizontally. You can cut it all the way through, leaving you with two separate pieces, or you can cut it almost all the way through and then open it like a book.

, Lay down one layer of wax paper or plastic wrap on top of a large cutting board. Place the chicken breast on the wax paper. Then, cover it with another layer of wax paper or plastic wrap.








Alternatively, you can place the chicken in a plastic bag, as long as you ensure that there is no air in the bag, and there is enough extra space for the chicken to flatten out.
Many chefs prefer moistening their wax paper or plastic wrap with water to ensure that the chicken doesn't stick too much., Pound lightly in the center, making sure to use enough force to flatten the chicken. Then, move out to the sides of the breast, making sure the entire breast is even.








If you donâ€™t have a meat mallet, you can pound the breast with a rolling pin.
 Once your chicken feels flat enough for whatever recipe you are following, or whatever dish you are preparing, remove the top layer of paper or plastic wrap. Double check that it is even. Then, you can begin spreading filling on the top, transfer it to a dish with a spatula, or whatever else your recipe calls for.








If your chicken breast is uneven or not flat enough, simply place the wax paper or plastic wrap back on it and pound out the uneven spots.

Most individuals develop typical symptoms of the flu, including:

Fever
Sore throat
Cough
Headache
Muscle or joint pains
Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea


However, individuals with certain conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, obesity, heart disease, HIV/AIDS, neurodevelopmental conditions (in children), or pregnancy, may be subject to more severe symptoms, or even develop viral pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, which manifests itself as increased breathing difficulty, typically occurs 3–6 days after initial onset of flu symptoms.;
, You should not get the vaccine if you are sick, work on a poultry farm, et cetera.

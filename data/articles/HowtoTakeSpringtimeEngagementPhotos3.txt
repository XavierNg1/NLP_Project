 Use a vintage car, old bicycle, or other antiques for a vintage theme. An outdoors photo with vintage props works really well in the spring. Combine flowers with your prop to emphasize the season.Accessorize with vintage jewelry, especially pieces that feature light gemstones or pearls.
 Gather some flowers for a small bouquet of spring flowers. Or wear a floral crown to show off springtime blooms. Add flowers or other greenery to shots inside or out. Look for brightly colored flowers to emphasize a springtime look.


Add springlike accessories, like scarves or ties with flowers.
 Find props that are appropriate to your setting, like an oar if youâ€™re taking photos near the water. Also keep the background and any props and accessories low-key so the primary focus is on the two of you. Avoid anything that might distract from your faces, like clothes with patterns that overwhelm you, or overlarge accessories or props.

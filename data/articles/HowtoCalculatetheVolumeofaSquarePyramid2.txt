 Sometimes you will not be told the perpendicular height of the pyramid. Instead, you may be told - or may have to measure - the pyramid’s slant height. With the slant height, you will be able to use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the perpendicular height.A pyramid's slant height is the distance from its apex to the midpoint of one of the base sides. Measure to the midpoint of the side and not to one of the corners of the base. For this example, assume that you measure the slant height to be 13 cm, and you are told that the side length is 10 cm.

As a reminder, the Pythagorean Theorem can be expressed as the equation a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the perpendicular legs of the right triangle and c{\displaystyle c} is the hypotenuse.
 To use the Pythagorean Theorem, you need a right triangle. Imagine a right triangle slicing through the middle of the pyramid and perpendicular to the base of the pyramid. The slant height of the pyramid, called l{\displaystyle l}, is the hypotenuse of this right triangle. The base of this right triangle is one half the length of s{\displaystyle s}, the side of the square base of the pyramid., The Pythagorean Theorem uses the variables a, b, and c, but it helps to replace those with variables that have meaning for your problem. The slant height l{\displaystyle l} takes the place of c{\displaystyle c} in the Pythagorean Theorem. The leg of the right triangle, which is s2{\displaystyle {\frac {s}{2}}}, takes the place of b.{\displaystyle b.} You will be solving for the height of the pyramid, h{\displaystyle h}, which takes the place of a{\displaystyle a} in the Pythagorean Theorem.

This substitution will look like this:


a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}


h2+(s2)2=l2{\displaystyle h^{2}+({\frac {s}{2}})^{2}=l^{2}}




, Insert the measured values of s=10{\displaystyle s=10} and l=13{\displaystyle l=13}. Then proceed to solve the equation:


h2=l2−(s2)2{\displaystyle h^{2}=l^{2}-({\frac {s}{2}})^{2}}.....(original equation)


h=l2−(s2)2{\displaystyle h={\sqrt {l^{2}-({\frac {s}{2}})^{2}}}}.....(square root both sides)


h=132−(102)2{\displaystyle h={\sqrt {13^{2}-({\frac {10}{2}})^{2}}}}.....(substitute values)


h=169−52{\displaystyle h={\sqrt {169-5^{2}}}}.....(simplify fraction)


h=169−25{\displaystyle h={\sqrt {169-25}}}.....(simplify square)


h=144{\displaystyle h={\sqrt {144}}}.....(subtract)


h=12{\displaystyle h=12}.....(simplify square root)


, After using the calculations with the Pythagorean Theorem, you now have the information you need to calculate the volume of the pyramid as you normally would. Use the formula V=13s2h{\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}s^{2}h} and solve, making sure to label your answer in cubic units.From the calculations, the height of the pyramid is 12 cm. Use this and the base side of 10 cm. to calculate the pyramid's volume:


V=13s2h{\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}s^{2}h}


V=13(102)12{\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}(10^{2})12}


V=13(100)(12){\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}(100)(12)}


V=400cm3{\displaystyle V=400{\text{cm}}^{3}}

 The most effective way to avoid getting mosquito bites is to avoid being around mosquitoes. This means that in order to assure that you are not bitten, you will need to stay indoors in rooms that have screens on the windows or have closed windows and air conditioning. Keeping mosquitoes out of your home and staying in your home is the best way to avoid getting bitten.This is especially important at times of day when they are most active, at dusk and dawn.
 If you are staying somewhere that is not airtight, and thus mosquitoes can get into your home, then you should use mosquito netting to avoid getting bitten. A bed that is covered in mosquito netting can be very effective in keeping you from getting bitten while you sleep.If you are spending time outdoors, for instance eating a meal outside, consider covering the area you are spending time in in mosquito netting. A patio or tent that is concealed in mosquito netting will allow you to be outside, while protecting you from mosquito bites.
 There are a variety of products that you can use to keep mosquitoes at bay. The most commonly used product is citronella, which mosquitoes do not like the smell of. Citronella is most commonly put into candles, which are burned to release its odor into the air.However, candles that contain geraniol, a different mosquito deterrent, will be more effective at keeping mosquitoes away than those containing citronella. Mosquito deterring products, such as Citronella, are available at most home improvement stores, as well as online.

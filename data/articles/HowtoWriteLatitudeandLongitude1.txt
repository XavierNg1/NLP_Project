 Lines of longitude are vertical lines that stretch across the globe, moving from the North to South Pole. The Prime Meridian divides lines of longitude. This is the zero degree mark. When writing out lines of longitude, use the symbol "°" to indicate degrees.Lines of longitude stretch from east to west. Moving to the east, each line of longitude increases by one degree. You use the letter "E" to indicate a line of longitude that falls to the east of the Prime Meridian. For example, a line of longitude could be 30°E.
Moving to the west, lines of longitude also increase by one degree per line. You write lines of longitude that fall to the west of the Prime Meridian using the symbol "W" to indicate west. For example, a line of longitude could be 15°E.;
, Lines of latitude are horizontal lines dividing the globe. They stretch from east to west, starting at the equator. The equator's line of latitude is marked by 0 degrees. When writing latitude and longitude, use the symbol "°" to indicate degrees.As you move north of the equator, lines of latitude increase by one degree until they reach 90 degrees. The 90 degree mark is the North Pole. Lines of latitude above the equator are marked using the letter "N" to mean North. For example, a line of latitude could be 15°N.
As you move south of the equator, lines of latitude again increase by a single degree for each line until you reach the 90 degree mark. This is the South Pole. You use the symbol "S" to indicate south. For example, a line of latitude could be 30°S.
 Find a location and figure out where the lines of latitude and longitude connect. For example, a location could be found along the latitude line 15°N and the longitude line 30°E. When writing latitude and longitude, write latitude first, followed by a comma, and then longitude.For example, the above lines of latitude and longitude would be written as "15°N, 30°E."

 There often comes to a stage where people can get addicted to pleasant experiences and/or afraid of unpleasant ones. The searching makes the meditation unpleasant and, being a desire, that search compounds itself into more and more misery and depression.


Generally there is deficit of understanding or kindness that forces you to desire to look for something better, so it is the addiction that needs to be addressed, as well as the fear of unpleasant experiences.
 Aim to understand and be amiable with life as it is.
 Ultimately it is very important to understand that happiness is found when you stop looking for it. It is the desires that propel us to search, but never lead us to it as desires and addictions are self perpetuating.

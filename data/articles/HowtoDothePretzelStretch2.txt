 From a standing position, lift up your left thigh so that it is close to the side of your body. Pull it in as close to your body as you comfortably can.








If this position or any other position feels uncomfortable, then reduce the stretch or get out of the stretch right away. Otherwise you may injure yourself., Steady yourself if you need to. Then, take your left arm and bring it around the front of your thigh and then loop it under your knee. Reach towards your back with your left arm.
 Put your right arm behind your back and grab your left hand with your right hand. Keep your hands tightly clasped behind your back.








If you cannot grasp hands, then try using a towel. Hold the towel in your left hand and then grab the towel with your right hand. You can also use a towel to help you reach your toes if you are not yet flexible enough to do so., Lift your left foot into the air so that your left leg is as straight as possible. Then point your toe out and hold the pose.








If you canâ€™t fully extend your leg in the beginning, that is fine! Just keep working on improving your flexibility and you will get there.

 Solid color suits look sleek and stylish. Your figure may be curvy enough to draw attention on its own, so there is not much need to worry about accentuating certain parts or downplaying others.;
, Odds are, you have a curvy bust worth showing off. A deep v-neck or similar style will help you show off your upper curves while keeping supporting your bust.
 These downplay your curves and may make you look boxy or unbalanced on the bottom.
 Ruffles emphasize your upper curves, but heavy ruffles can make you look unbalanced. Keep things in proportion by making sure you have ties or other details at the hip, as well.
 If you would rather mask your curviness than flaunt it, look for small polka dots or other tiny prints. These pieces have a concealing effect that may reduce volume all over.

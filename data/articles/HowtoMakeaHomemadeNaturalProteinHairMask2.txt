 Place a ripe avocado that’s been peeled and pitted into a small bowl, and use a fork to crush it. Continue mashing the avocado until it has a smooth, creamy consistency.Avocado helps moisturize and revitalize the hair.
 After you’ve mashed the avocado, mix 2 tablespoons (30 g) of mayonnaise into the bowl. Stir it into the avocado until a smooth, thick paste forms.Mayonnaise contains proteins to help strengthen the hair, oils to moisturize, and vinegar to boost shine.
 Use your hands to carefully apply the thick paste to your hair, massaging it in with your fingers. To see the full benefits of the mask, allow it to sit on your head for approximately 30 minutes.If you want to ensure that the mask has coated all of your hair, use a wide-tooth comb to comb it through your hair.
 When you’ve let the mask sit for half an hour, rinse it from your hair with fresh water at the sink or in the shower. Follow up with your usual shampoo and conditioner for healthy, moisturized locks.

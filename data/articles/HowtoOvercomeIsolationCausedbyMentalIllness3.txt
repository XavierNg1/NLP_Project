 If you feel socially awkward or inept to be in certain social groups, it can help to sign up for some life skills classes. Depending on where you live, there may be classes to help you learn how to make friends and hold a conversation. There are even those that teach basic skills that you need like cooking, driving, or cleaning your home.Ask your therapist to recommend any life skills classes in your area that might suit your needs.
 Feeling isolated with a mental health condition is a common occurrence. Many times, however, it’s found to be the person who is isolating themselves. Perhaps everyone around you yearns to help and connect, but you push them away for some reason. Oftentimes, that reason lies in your head.

The thoughts that go through your mind all day largely affect your feelings and behavior. If you are constantly telling yourself, “No one wants to be around me” you could be noticing all the people who are stigmatizing you, but failing to notice all those who genuinely want your company.
Learn to identify thoughts that make you feel bad. Then, reframe these negative thoughts into a positive statement, such as “Some people would like to spend time with me. I will focus on them and not pay attention to others who don’t.”, The best thing you can do to overcome isolation with a mental illness is to get better. When you are feeling controlled by psychological symptoms, it can be difficult to engage or seek out others’ company. As you go through therapy and take your medication (if you have them), you will start to feel better about yourself and regain the confidence to socialize.

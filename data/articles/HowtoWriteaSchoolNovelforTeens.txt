 At the same time, you don't want your name to be completely ridiculous, so look for a good balance.;
, Look at the cliques at your school to help you at. Try not to follow stereotypes, though: it's okay to have a jock who loves to read or a depressed cheerleader. Sometimes, it helps if you draw them (or get a picture online) and write a short summary of their personality so you get a feel for them.
 Maybe it's an all-girls private school, or a school for 'troubled children.' You also will need a name for the school: you can name it after a famous person (Abraham Lincoln High), the town (Hollywood Academy for the Preforming Arts), or a made-up person (Jessica Sydney High School).
 Don't go in without an escape route - some vague idea of how or where you want the book to end up. At least know the sub-genre: drama, romance, action? Fantasy?

, Your first sentences should hook the reader. By the first or second chapter, you should have revealed a little bit about the main character and a little bit of the school. A chapter can be anywhere from a page to thirty pages - whatever you do best.
 Maybe the main character lost her popularity due to a rumor; maybe she was framed for some rule-breaking. Keep it original, but also believable. Ask yourself: could I see this happening in my school?

, If you plan on writing a second book, you can leave loose ends or cliffhangers, which is a suspenseful ending, in the last pages.
 Tell them to not just give you a positive critique. I would recommend staying away from parents (They probably will give you a 'Oh I'm so proud!' response). A good friend, English teacher, older sibling or someone else you're close to would be a good choice.
 You can do this yourself, or ask someone you know (see above) to help you, or both.
 The book Eragon was written by a fifteen year old boy. At the same time, remember that publication is a tricky business and it takes an undefinable amount of effort just to get someone to look at your manuscript.

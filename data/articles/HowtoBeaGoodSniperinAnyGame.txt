 If you are getting killed and don't know where the sniper is, it means that there are good sniping spots somewhere.;
, Just find some place where you have good visibility and are mostly hidden

, Go back to the place you got killed from, then hide behind something. Find out where the sniper can and cannot see, and hopefully eliminate them. (either by sniping them or lobbing a grenade at them)

, If it's some pro-gamer spot, then forget it.
 This should be somewhere hidden in shadows.
 A good sniper never sticks to one spot, then everyone just thinks you're not smart. Move around so nobody concentrates on one spot so they can kill you.
 (using your wrist causes more jerky aiming)

, One of the worst things is when you're sniping, and about to get in a good shot, someone comes and kills you from behind. Make sure that you have a wall behind you, or you know that no one can get to your back.

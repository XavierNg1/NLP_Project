 Loads of stress can hurt your ability to produce milk.Try to relax before pumping or breastfeeding by playing soothing music, looking at pictures that produce happiness, or just having a moment with the love of your life.


If you want to, try putting warm compresses on your breasts or massaging them for a short period right before you intend to pump or breastfeed.
 The more often your breasts are stimulated, the more milk your body makes. At least 8 feedings in a 24-hour period is ideal, more if possible. If you normally feed on a set schedule, allow the baby to feed on demand to increase your breast milk production.
 (Longer sessions mean more production of breast milk.)


Undress your baby down to his diaper, but drape a blanket over his back to ensure that he doesn't get cold.
Take off your bra and wear a shirt that can be unbuttoned on the front to promote skin-to-skin contact.
 Wearing a sling and keeping your baby close to the ultimate food supply should encourage him to feast more frequently. Some babies tend to feed more when on the move.
 Switch breasts as soon as your baby slows down. It's best if you can switch again and offer each breast twice during a single feeding session. Let your baby nurse for as long as possible-until he falls asleep or detaches.
"For a day or two, take your baby to bed with you and do nothing but nurse when the urge hits your baby. Of course, you get to go to the kitchen and the bathroom and hit other motherly duties, but this vacation is all about you and your newborn.


During this vacation, take advantage of nap nursing, which is exactly what it sounds: sleeping with your baby ever-close to his favorite food. This relaxes both mother and child. It also increases the stimulation of milk-producing hormones.

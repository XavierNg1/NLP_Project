 If you want to room-share, place a bed for your baby right next to yours. You can put a bassinet, crib, cot, or play yard in the room. You can be close to your baby, but reduce the dangers of bed-sharing., If you want to be closer than a crib, you can place a bedside sleeper on your bed. This bed attaches directly to the bed so you can be next to your baby, but keeps you separated on different surfaces., If you co-sleep with your baby, you should do this until around 12 months of age. However, if you want to move them to their own room before that, wait until they are at least six months old.

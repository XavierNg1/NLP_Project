 This procedure will allow you to change the width of the taskbar.


Right-click directly on an empty portion of the taskbar, then remove the checkmark next to "Lock the taskbar." If no checkmark is present, the taskbar is already unlocked.



Place your cursor on the outer edge of the taskbar until you see the cursor change into an arrow with 2 heads.
Click on the edge of the taskbar, then drag the taskbar until you have reached a satisfying width.
Release your mouse to secure the taskbar's current width.
 This will help keep your taskbar's width in place and prevent it from being accidentally resized.


Right-click in the taskbar and place a checkmark next to "Lock the taskbar."

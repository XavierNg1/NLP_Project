 Use a sharp serrated knife to rough chop the onion into medium pieces. You do not need to mince or finely chop the onion, but small to medium pieces work better in a blender than large pieces do.
 Use a medium-high to high speed and blend the chopped onion for about 1 minute, turning the onion into a thick puree.
 Blending the onion for 1 minute should be enough to puree the onion, but every blender works a little differently. If you still have notable pieces of onion in your blender, stop the blender, open the lid, and push the pieces down toward the blades using a rubber spatula. Replace the lid and continue blending at 30 second intervals at high speed until completely blended.
 The strainer should be small enough to fit inside the bowl, but if possible, large enough to rest on the lip of the bowl. Otherwise, hold the strainer over the mouth of the bowl with one hand.
 The thinness of the cheesecloth will make it easier to filter out the juice while trapping the solid pulp.
 Transfer the onion from the blender into the center of the cheesecloth. Use a spoon or rubber spatula to push the onion pulp into the cheesecloth and the strainer and into the bowl. Continue pressing the pulp until you no longer see juice dripping out from the bottom of the strainer.

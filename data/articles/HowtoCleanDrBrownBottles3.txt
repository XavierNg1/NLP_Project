 Next, wash the pieces with your prefered method.Even if you are sanitizing a new bottle, you should wash it first.
 To sterilize the bottle, you’ll need a medium or large pot. Add enough water to the pot to cover the bottle and all of its components when it is either lying on its side or standing up.While you can leave the bottle and its components in the pot while you’re adding the water to determine the appropriate level, be sure to take them out before you place the pot on the stove.
 Once the pot is filled with water, set it on the stove top. Heat the water on medium-high until it comes to a boil, which should take 7 to 10 minutes., When the water is boiling, carefully add the bottle and its parts to the pot. Let the soak in the boiling water for 5 minutes to fully sanitize them.Be very careful when placing the bottle and parts into the boiling water because the water and steam can easily burn your skin. You may want to use a pair of tongs to place them in the water.
 After the bottle and parts have boiled in the water for 5 minutes, shut off the heat. Remove the pot from the stove, and let the water cool, which should take 15 to 30 minutes., When the water is cool, lift the bottle out pieces out of the water. Set them down on a clean towel and allow them to dry completely for several hours or overnight.For best results, use clean tongs to lift the bottle and parts out of the water. If you are using your hands, make sure that they are freshly washed.
Pat the bottle and parts dry as best you can with a clean towel before setting them out to dry.

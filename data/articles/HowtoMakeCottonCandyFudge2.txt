 Place two big sheets of parchment paper crosswise into a 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02-centimeter) baking pan so that both the bottom and sides are covered. Leave some of the parchment paper hanging over the sides of the pan so that you can remove the fudge later., Cut the butter into small cubes, and put it into a saucepan. Add the sugar and the heavy cream. Stir everything together whisk, then cook over low heat until the butter melts and the sugar dissolves., Once the sugar has dissolved and the butter melted, turn the heat up to medium. Allow the mixture to come to a boil, then allow it to cook for 4 minutes. Stir it often., Take the saucepan off the burner and set it down on a heat-safe surface. Stir in the marshmallow creme and white chocolate chips. Keep stirring until both the creme and chips have melted and the mixture is smooth., The more food coloring you use, the brighter and more vibrant your fudge will turn out. If you can, try to use the gel-based food coloring and not the liquid one. Not only will the colors turn out better, but the texture as well., Use a rubber spatula to scrape the mixture out of the bowl and to spread it evenly across the baking sheet., It will take about 2 to 4 hours for it to set., Take the baking pan out of the refrigerator and set it down on the counter. Use the overhanging parchment paper to lift the fudge out. Set the fudge down on the counter and cut it into 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) squares.

 Refrain from voicing every single thought you have racing through your mind in intimate moments. Get to the core of what you want to communicate instead of rambling.Keep it short and sweet. Whisper something like, “Saying ‘yes’ to you was the best thing I’ve ever done in my life.”
Be genuine, look into your lover’s eyes, and say, “You are the best I’ve ever had – companion, lover, and friend.”

, Compliment your partner on the way they kiss. Focus on exactly what it is you love about them or being intimate in those moments.Kiss your partner and in between kisses, say something like, “I love the love our love. It’s so intense, so passionate. I feel you all over me.”
Make them feel important and sexy by saying to them, “I love how I feel when I’m with you. I feel so alive.”

, Look deeply into one another’s eyes, and give them one of the many reasons why they have your heart. Ask him or her, “Do you know why I love you?”If you’re being sweet, say something like, “I love you because of who you are. I’m a better me for knowing you.”
If you’re being a little dirty, say something like, “I love you because of how good you feel wrapped around me.”

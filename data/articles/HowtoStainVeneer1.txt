 You have a choice of oil based, water based and gel stains. Each one has slightly different qualities that make it ideal for one wood but not another.


An example of this is that some trees, such as teak and rosewood, have more natural oil in them than other woods such as oak or hickory. The oily wood will not take a water based stain as well as one of the less oily woods, so this has to be considered when choosing stains.
The basic steps for staining veneer are the same but setting and waiting times are different for each of the stains, gel, oil and water.
 Most mill sawn veneer and backed veneer will not need sanding. Mill sawn veneer is very thin, 1/42 inch (0.60 mm) and will not stand up to heavy sanding.
 Stop and check frequently to avoid damaging the veneer.
, Test for correct color on a piece of scrap veneer or in an inconspicuous spot.
 Allow the conditioner to stand for 5 to 15 minutes, and wipe off with a clean rag. Do not wait more than 2 hours before applying gel stain.
 Allow it to set for 3 minutes and wipe off stain with a clean rag, again following the grain of the wood.
 If the color is not deep enough, apply additional coats in the same manner as the first until you have the desired look.

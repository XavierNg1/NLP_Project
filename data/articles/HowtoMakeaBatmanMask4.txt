 Use a heavy weight paper to print your mask to make it more durable.


Configure your printer’s settings for a heavy duty paper to ensure that the paper feeds through the printer correctly.
 Select the document for the mask template and open it using your computer’s PDF reader or MS-Word.
 Cut around the edge of the mask template with scissors to cut out the mask. Poke scissors into the eye holes to cut out the eyes in the middle of the mask.
 Use a hole punch to create a hole on each side of the mask. Tie a string to each end of the mask.


Tie one end of the string and hold the mask up to your face. Wrap the string around the back of your head to measure how long to make the string before tying it to the other side of the mask.
Reinforce the holes and attached string with a piece of tape to avoid tearing the mask when you wear it.

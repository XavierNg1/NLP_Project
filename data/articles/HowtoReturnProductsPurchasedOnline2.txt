 If you have a link to the sellerâ€™s store, a confirmation email or access to the same listing you should be able to review for return restrictions. Unlike other retailers, eBay return rules depend on the store from which you purchased.


Sellers are able to place restrictions on returns. Pay attention to this area of the list before you purchase to ensure you can return the item.
The seller may list only cash or only exchange on their return terms.
 In some cases only one of these is available.
 Refunds and returns are more easily processed with PayPal than check or money order.
 Use the email address that is listed to contact the seller via email and ask for a return and exchange or refund. Explain the reasons for returning the item as specifically as possible.
 Ask the seller if they can generate an automatic return shipping label for you. If they use a service, like USPS or UPS, this may be possible.
 Use extra padding, since returning the item in the condition it was received is essential for processing the return. Include your name, address, email, eBay item number, purchase confirmation, preferred payment and emails with the seller regarding the return inside the shipping box.
 Pay for USPS, UPS or FedEx postage with tracking.
 Ask the seller how much time will be necessary to issue your refund. Look out for communication from the seller. The return process may take up to a month, so be patient in the meantime.
 Only give negative feedback if you feel as though the seller was not honest in their refund process.

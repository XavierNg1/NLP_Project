 A little soap and water is all you need. You can even let the razor soak in a cup for a few minutes. Then give a quick rinse to let the leftover gunk wash away., Shake away the excess moisture, then dab the razor on a soft towel. You can also use a blow-dryer or fan, or even just hang it upside down to let the water drip off., The easiest way to hone your disposable razor and get some more life out of it is to use a pair of jeans. The denim will align the indentations on your blade to create a smoother cut, and extend the life of your disposable razor.Lay a pair of jeans on a flat surface. You shouldn't be wearing the jeans when you do this.
Run the blades over the jeans. Draw the blade up the length of a leg. Move it in the opposite direction that you would use for shaving. 10 to 20 strokes should be enough to sharpen the blade.
The denim threads on jeans run in a diagonal direction, so to balance the work, drag the blade both up and down the leg, always moving in the opposite direction you would use for shaving.
 The skin on your arm is somewhat leathery, like a strop, and can help hone a blade. Run the razor along your arm from the elbow to the wrist about 10 to 20 times. Instead of pulling it along the arm as you would if you were actually shaving, push it along your arm with the sharp edge of the blade is facing away from you. Then, repeat in the opposite direction (wrist to elbow), again keeping the blade away from you., A strop is a thick piece of leather used to sharpen the blades of straight edge razors, though there are strops that can help disposable razors. Using the suede side of the strop, push the blade backwards along the strop several times to hone the edge.

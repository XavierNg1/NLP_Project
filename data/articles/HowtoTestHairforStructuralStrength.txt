 Take it from the side, just above your ears.
 Using your other hand, run the thumbnail and index finger along the hair quickly. The end result should be spring of curls., Only do this for a few seconds and then release. This is what the test can tell you about your hair:
Hair that springs back to the curly spring is in good to excellent condition
Hair that returns in much larger loops, or barely at all, is in poor condition. In this case, your hair needs conditioning and probably a visit to the hairdresser.

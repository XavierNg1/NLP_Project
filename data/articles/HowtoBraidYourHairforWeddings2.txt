 A side braid is best for long hair. A side braid can be created as ponytail with a braid or as braid along the side of your head. The side braid can be styled to look sleek and sophisticated or carefree and whimsical, depending on your personal preference.



Gather the hair into a ponytail at the nape of your neck, and secure with an elastic along 1 side of your neck.






Separate the hair into 3 sections and braid them together by slipping 1 section between the other 2 sections in a traditional braid pattern.






Secure the end of the braid with a small hair elastic or rubber band.

Keep hair in a tight braid for a sleek look. Mist the entire style with hair spray to keep hair in place and prevent flyaways.






Pull small strands of hair from the braid for a more carefree look. Focus on pulling strands along your forehead and ears to create a face-framing hairstyle. Using a curling iron, curl the loose strands to give texture to your style.

 Since Google owns YouTube, you may have an account without knowing it. If you have a Google account that you use for Gmail or any other Google service, you have a YouTube account as well.


Go to this link: https://www.youtube.com/account and create a new account if you do not already have one. Before creating a new account, though, be sure that you can't login to your google account.
 The best way to upload a video from your cell phone is to use YouTube's own application. Additionally, it is a great way to watch videos from your favorite channels on your mobile device.



For iPhone Users:Go to this link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/youtube/id544007664?mt=8 and download the application.

For Android Users: Go to this link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube&hl=en and download the application.
Alternatively, go to your phone's application store and search for "YouTube by Google."

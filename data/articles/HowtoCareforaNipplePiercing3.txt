 Avoid cleaning with Betadine, Hibiclens, Bactine, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, Dial or other harsh soaps. Also avoid cleaners that contain Benzalkonium Chloride (BZK). You should also avoid ointments such as Neosporin, bacitracin, and other antibiotic ointments. These ointments contain petroleum jelly and will keep your piercings moist. A moist piercing attracts bacteria.These cleaners and ointments will hurt the healing process and keep your piercing from getting oxygen.
Also avoid getting any of your personal care products (e.g. lotion, shampoo, conditioner) on your piercing. If you are cleaning your piercing in the shower, clean it after you have washed your hair and used your other products.
 It can be tempting to touch and play with your piercing, but you must avoid doing this. If your piercing is still healing, do not touch it unless you are cleaning it.Do not rotate or twist the jewelry either.
 Dry your piercing as soon as you get out of the shower or finish cleaning it. Routinely change your clothing and do not leave sweaty, tight clothing on the piercing for long periods of time. Always use a clean, disposable item (e.g. paper towel, cotton ball, etc.) to dry your piercing. Towels contain bacteria.


Do not submerge your piercing in a lake, pool, or hot tub. It is best to not go swimming until your piercing is fully healed.
If you do go swimming, wear a waterproof bandage and clean your piercing as soon as you are finished.

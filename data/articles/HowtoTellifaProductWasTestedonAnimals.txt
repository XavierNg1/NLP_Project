 Does it say "This Product Has Not Been Tested On Animals" or something similar? If it does, that's a definite sign it hasn't been animal tested. Many animal tested products have failed to be safe for humans, and there are better alternatives than animal testing.;
, If it says something like "Do Not Put In Eyes" or "Do Not Swallow," it could be a subtle warning that the product has been animal tested - because these can be hints that they have failed animal safety tests. However, if it says it hasn't been tested on animals it's probably just wanting you to be cautious.
 You'd be surprised how many are tested on animals - so do your research first! Online is the best source to get the information, because while lies are abundant on the Internet, the Internet is also more likely to have information on whether the product is animal tested or not than a magazine or book about the product.

 Before you put on a bandana, fix your hair the way you want it to look under the headband. Adjusting your hair afterwards could cause your bandana to become untied or displaced.
 Lay your bandana flat on a solid surface. Fold the bandana over and over in 2 inch (approximately 5 cm) increments. Continue folding until the bandana is one long strip.
 To ensure that your headband stays put, spray it with hairspray before putting it on. Lay the folded bandana down with the inside facing upwards (i.e. the side that the triangle point of material is folded in on). Spray from the middle of the headband towards each end.
 Position the folded bandana on or near your hairline, depending on whether you want to show any hair or not. Hold one end of the bandana in each end and pull them down under your hair and tie them together at the base of your neck.
 As an alternative method of wearing your headband, position the middle of the strip at the base of your head, under your hair. Pull the ends of the bandana up around your head, above your ears, and to to the top of your head (a bit above the hairline). Tie a square knot to secure the headband.
 To keep your headband in place, pin it down with bobby pins. Pin your bandana behind your ears, or behind your head, to secure it. Avoid pinning down your hairstyle at the top of your head, where the pins will be more obvious.

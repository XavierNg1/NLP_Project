 In 90% of all cases, a bacterial infection is to blame. This bacteria can be sexually transmitted (as with chlamydia or gonococcal, the bacteria that causes gonorrhea), but that’s not always the case. Other bacteria that frequently cause salpingitis are:


mycoplasma
staphylococcus
streptococcus

, Less commonly, salpingitis can be caused by a virus.
 In some cases, PID can begin an infection or inflammation in other reproductive organs, then spread to the fallopian tubes, causing salpingitis. PID involves any inflammation and infection in the reproductive organs, and it’s very common – more than a million women in the United States experience it each year.
 Medical procedures themselves aren’t to blame for salpingitis, but some of them are responsible for introducing bacteria through the cervix and into the uterus and fallopian tubes. Laparoscopy, uterine and endometrial biopsies, and dilatation and curettage (D&C) procedures can all do this, as can the insertion of an intrauterine device (IUD).
 Abortion, miscarriage, and childbirth can all introduce bacteria through the cervix and into the reproductive organs. This bacteria can cause salpingitis. If you have any of the symptoms above and have recently been pregnant (no matter what the outcome of that pregnancy was), you should definitely talk to your doctor as soon as possible.

 Place these ingredients in a large bowl and stir them until they are thoroughly combined. Whisking them all together works best. This recipe makes 6 servings or around 36 fritters.
 Once you've combined the first set of ingredients, you should stir the next set together until you've thoroughly combined everything again.
 You can use canned corn or corn fresh off a cooked cob. Now, use a mixing spoon to fold the ingredients into the batter until they're fully incorporated. They don't have to stick together completely; thanks to the milk, the mixture should be a little bit loose. If it's too chunky, add a bit more milk to loosen it up.
 Use a deep fry thermometer to make sure the oil doesn't get hotter than this; if it does, the fritters will burn right away. You can go ahead and start heating the oil while you make the batter to save time since it'll take a little while for it to heat up.
 You can use a cookie scooper or a regular spoon to scoop out each spoonful of dough. It will expand and should be no bigger than a ping-pong ball. Once you've scooped it out, drop it into the oil. You can throw in as many spoonfuls at a time as will comfortably fit into the pot.
 Give each spoonful about 2-3 minutes on each side before flipping it over, allowing it to brown evenly. You have to keep a close eye on them during this time to make sure they don't burn.
 Use a slotted spoon to remove the fritters from the oil, shaking off the excess oil, and place them on a paper towel over a plate.
 You can enjoy these tasty corn fritters on their own, or you can sprinkle them with a spoonful of powdered sugar or lightly drizzle them with maple syrup. Enjoy them for breakfast, as a snack, or during any time of day.

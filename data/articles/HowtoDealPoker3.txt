 The player in the small blind should receive the first card. This will be the player to your immediate left; they should place a bet equivalent to half of that round’s full bet., Go around the table allowing every player to raise (by the amount of the big blind or more), call (match the current bet), or fold (give up for the round). Moving clockwise from the player in the small blind, bets will be made until every player has folded, put in their chips, or matched the amount of other players combined., After every player has paid a blind or made an ante, as required by the rules by which you are playing, deal three cards face down to each player, beginning with a player to your left and ending with yourself. A second betting round will follow.
 Texas Hold’em is a game in which the incomplete, hidden hand of players is combined with face-up cards that are shared. This first shared card is known as the turn. A third round of betting will ensue, moving clockwise from your left., This is known as the river. A fourth round of betting and a showdown will follow., The best 5-card hand that can be made from the 2 cards in a player’s hand and the 5 on the table is the winner.

 This could be a hedge, some bushes at the side of the road, or right in your back garden! Don't be afraid to go just beyond one bit of shrubbery - picking blackberries can evoke an excellent opportunity for an autumn walk! Make sure you bring a tub with you, otherwise you'll struggle in bringing them all back to your house if you pick a lot.
 Choose the darkest coloured, purplish blackberries - the red ones won't taste as nice, and the green ones haven't ripened yet.
 (Pulling straight down can damage the berries). If the berry doesn't easily release, it's not ripe yet. If it falls apart in your fingers, it's overripe and should be discarded.
 Once you've got enough berries from that hedge, move onto the next one. Blackberries are common fruit - you'll find them almost everywhere, so looking for them won't be hard.
 There are thousands of possibilities - you could make a blackberry pie, a tart, jam, ice cream, or you could just simply eat them raw. The choice is yours - it's up to you what you do, but make sure you enjoy them!

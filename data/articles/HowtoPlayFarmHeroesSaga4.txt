 If you can, complete the levelâ€™s goals with some remaining moves. Once you reach all the goals, you will enter Hero Mode, which will allow you to use the remaining moves to make more matches to get more points.
 When you enter Hero Mode, random cropsies will get bonus points or multipliers after each move. You can see these reflected on the cropsies.
 Play as you normally would and make the matches. You can also do more than three cropsies in a row or column to continue increasing the multipliers.
 To get the most out of Hero Mode, match and collect cropsies with the highest multipliers. The greater the number of bonus points per match, the more points you get.

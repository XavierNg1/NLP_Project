 These exact specifications are not quite as important as the others, so use what you have left however it fits. The stand is made of one long piece of PVC pip (1/2"), and three smaller legs extending off the sides, flat on the ground, to keep everything standing up.
 You want the actual launcher (the bushing with the holes in it) pointed straight up to the sky. Glue in the small piece to the elbow, then attach a T-joint to that small piece of pipe.
 This is your first support foot. Glue it in, then glue on an air-tight cap over the end to keep pressure up.
 Make sure that this T-joint points the opposite direction as the other one for maximum support. As always, glue everything air-tight and glue on an end cap to prevent air leakage.
 The whole thing makes a small U-shape, with the two feet sticking perpendicular away from the frame.
 You may need one more small piece of PVC to connect the elbow joint to the cap with the valve. Remember -- you can never glue it too air-tight!

 Pour the water into a small pot and set it on the stove over medium-high heat. Bring the water to a full boil.
 Keep the pot in place on the same burner, but turn off the heat.
 Stir it in so it's fully incorporated, being careful not to splash the hot water.
 Keep stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved.
 Pour in the water and the Kool-Aid and mix until fully combined.
 Plastic popsicle molds work perfectly, but if you don't have any on hand, just use an ice cube tray. Place popsicle sticks, straws or chopstick pieces in the center of the molds.
 Place them in the freezer and freeze the mixture for several hours, until it's completely solid.
 If you have trouble getting them out, run hot water over the bottom of the molds for 20 to 30 seconds, then try again. The hot water will help loosen the popsicles.

 Tin or glass pie dishes are most common.






;
, To achieve a snug fit, gently drop the pie dish onto the kitchen bench a few times to help the pastry settle into the edges.
 Cover the dish with a clean tea towel or greaseproof paper. This firming assists in stopping the pastry from shrinking during baking.
 Don't overdo it, though; too many holes will let the filling leak through the crust.

, This prevents the pastry base from rising through air bubbles, which would leave it uneven and weakened. For easier clean-up, place the beans in an oven bag or a cheesecloth satchel tied with kitchen twine.
 If there is no suggested temperature, or you are making this up as you go, heat the oven to medium heat (approx. 200ºC/400ºF) and bake the base for approximately 15 minutes, (less for a pastry containing sugar). Keep an eye on its progress; the key colour to watch for is a light golden brown.
 At this stage, some chefs apply an egg wash to the crust to prevent it from absorbing moisture from the filling. To do this, cook the pastry for a little less time in Step 7. Pop the glazed base back into the oven for a 2-minute bake to set the egg wash. Remove once again and allow 1 minute for cooling before adding the filling.
 If you are not following a recipe, reduce the heat for the last baking (180ºC/350ºF). Because the base and edges are baked by now, the pastry will continue to brown while you leave the whole pie in the oven. To allay this, make sure the filling will bake quickly (sometimes you will need to precook it to get the baking time down enough) and cover the edges of the pastry with a foil ring.

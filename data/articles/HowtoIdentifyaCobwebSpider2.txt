 Cobweb spiders are sometimes called cobweb weavers because of the webs they create. These spiders make messy, irregular webs that have no distinct shape or form.These webs will not be circular or have a neat pattern like many spider webs. Instead, it may have an uneven, non-circular shape, have large open spaces with clumps in other parts, or look like it's been disturbed.
 Cobweb spiders like to build their webs and then spend their time hanging upside down in the middle of the web. If you get close enough, check to see if the head of the spider is hanging down right in the center., Cobweb spiders place their webs in dry, dark areas. They can be found in garages, eaves, attics, porches, sheds, and basements. They are also found just about everywhere indoors and around windows.You may also find them under decks and houses, or in piles of outdoor debris or trash.

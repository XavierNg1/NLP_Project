 American Psychological Association (APA) style is used most frequently for article covering the social sciences.General APA formatting requires a page header, alternately called a running head, at the top of every page of an article.The running head/page header should be an abbreviated version of your title. It should not be longer than 50 characters, including spaces and punctuation.The running head/page header should be typed in all capital letters., Level one headings give the title of one section in an article. Level one headings may be the only heading in an article, if the article only contains one long section.Level one headings should be centered in the middle of the page and typed in boldface font. The heading should use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, as appropriate.Generally, only major words are capitalized in APA format. In cases of a hyphenated compound word, only the first word is capitalized.Level one headings do not use any end punctuation, and should be followed by a line break., Level two headings give the title of a subsection within one section of an article.Level two headings should be left-aligned (flush with the left margin), typed in boldface font.Level two headings should use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, as appropriate. This follows the same general rule as a level one heading.Level two headings do not use any end punctuation, and should be followed by a line break., Level three headings give the title of a subsection within a subsection in an article.Level three headings should be indented from the left margin, typed in boldface font.Level three headings should be written in sentence case, where only the first letter of the heading is capitalized and the rest of the text is in lower case. The heading should end with a period and a space, and be followed immediately by the text of that subsection., Level four headings follow the same guidelines as level three headings, except that level four headings are typed in boldface and italicized font.Level four headings should be indented from the left margin, typed in boldface, italicized font with sentence case lettering. End a level four heading with a period, and begin the text immediately after the space that follows that period., Level five headings follow the same guidelines as level four headings, except they are written in italicized font without any boldface.Level five headings should be indented from the left margin, typed in italicized font without any boldface. Use sentence case lettering, end the heading with a period, and begin the text immediately after the space that follows that period.

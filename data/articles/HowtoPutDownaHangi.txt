 It is a lengthy process taking up to four hours just for the cooking. Preparing the food will take at least an hour or two depending on how many people are available to help. The more, the better!;

 Fill it up with wood (slow burning and high energy content), pile up some volcanic stones on top, or large lumps of steel. Heat these up for a few hours, keep adding wood if necessary. Maybe two to three hours of burning.
,, Whatever you or your group prefer. Put the meat under the vegetables in the basket as it will take longer to cook.
, Put wet sacks (hessian) over these cloths so that no earth can get onto the food.


Now shovel earth over the sacks carefully and make sure that no steam can escape. If you see steam escaping put some more earth on that spot.
Have some people stand by and keep an eye on the hangi whilst it cooks for about three to four hours. Better to leave it longer and make sure it is well and truly cooked. Everyone else can have some time off until serving time arrives. Don't take your eye off the mound of earth in the meantime though

, Be very careful as you sensitively remove the earth. You do not want to spoil the food at this stage.

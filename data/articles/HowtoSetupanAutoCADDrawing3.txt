 Before scaling, you should make sure that all layers are set to ON and UNLOCKED.


Note: Pretty much the same procedure can be used when rotating an object by an undefined angle.
 This is going to be your reference length.
Command: Scale --> select entire drawing, except your reference line, press space.



Type "re" (as reference), press space.
Pick first point and endpoint of the object from your drawing, that you want it to be 100 units long.
Type "po" (as points), press space.
, Instead of you having to calculate and writing down decimals, now AutoCAD will do it instead, and the result will be most accurately scaled drawing.

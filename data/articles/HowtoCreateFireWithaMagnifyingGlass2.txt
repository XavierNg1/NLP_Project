 This type is large and square like a sheet of paper. Although they usually don't have as much magnification, it's apparently the large surface area that makes it more efficient (it concentrates more solar energy on the target).
 The concentrated image will be rectangular not round, so focus as best you can to make the focal point small.
 It will work a little better if you hold it so that the smooth side faces the target.
 It should also be noted that this large lens will make an extremely bright area (much more so then a standard round 2 or 3 inch round glass). So do not stare at the point of light.
 Then follow the steps for a lit fire as explained in the previous method.

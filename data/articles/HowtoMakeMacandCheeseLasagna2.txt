 Heat a large skillet or pan over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Once the oil heats, stir in 1 diced onion, 2 cloves of chopped garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and 1/2 teaspoon of crushed fennel seeds. Stir the mixture occasionally and let it cook for about 7 to 8 minutes.The onion should become translucent and tender.
 Add 17 to 25 ounces (500 to 700 g) of ground beef. Stir it well to break up the beef. Cook the beef mixture for about 10 minutes or until it's browned and completely cooked.The meat should be cooked to 160 degrees F (70 C).
 Stir in 1 (28 ounce or 794 g) can of crushed tomatoes along with the following seasonings:1 teaspoon Italian seasoning or oregano
1 bay leaf
Â½ teaspoon paprika
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
Salt and pepper to taste

, Bring the meat sauce to a boil and turn the heat down to medium-low. Let the sauce bubble gently with the lid off. This will help the sauce thicken a little. Turn off the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of fresh, chopped basil. You should also preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 C).You can simmer the sauce as long as you like. If you don't have much time, even 5 minutes of simmering is fine.
 Spray a large casserole dish with cooking spray and spread 1 to 2 cups (150 to 300 g) of the meat sauce across the bottom. Measure out 2 1/2 cups (500 g) of cooked elbow macaroni and scatter half of the noodles over the sauce. Spread 1 cup (250 g) of cottage cheese over the noodles and sprinkle 1/3 cup (33 g) of grated mozzarella cheese and 1/3 cup (33 g) of grated cheddar cheese on top. Repeat these layers, so you end with grated cheese on top., Put the mac and cheese lasagna in the oven and bake it for 20 to 30 minutes. The cheese on top should be melted and golden brown. You should also see sauce bubbling up through the noodles.Garnish the casserole with some fresh parsley and serve it after it's set for a few minutes.

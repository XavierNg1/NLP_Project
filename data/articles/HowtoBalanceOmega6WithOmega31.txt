 Many foods, especially fast foods, are fried in vegetable oils that are very high in omega 6 fatty acids. You can cut out these high amounts of omega 6 altogether by avoiding foods such as fried chicken, French fries, and fry bread, among many others.Common omega 6 fatty acids are linoleic acid (LA) and gamma linoleic acid (GLA) and can be found in many vegetable oils.
Despite the high amount of omega 6 in vegetable oils, many restaurants continue to use them. Vegetable oils are stable at high temperatures, and they impart more flavor into food.;
, Processed foods are typically made with cheap vegetable oils high in omega 6 and low in omega 3. Eating too many processed foods results in an unhealthy increase of omega 6 fat intake.By reducing and replacing processed foods with whole foods and vegetables, you will decrease your consumption of omega 6 fatty acids.
 Olive oil is a good choice for cooking because it is very low in omega 6 fatty acids and saturated fat. Be sure to avoid using any partially hydrogenated oils because they tend to be high in trans fat.Some other oils that are low in omega 6 and saturated fats (and are thus good for cooking) are high oleic safflower oil, high oleic sunflower oil, and canola oil.
 Linoleic acid (LA) is high in omega 6 and low in omega 3. Frequent consumption of oils with linoleic acid will heighten the imbalance between omega 6 and omega 3 in your diet. Oils with LA include: peanut oil, soybean oil, cottonseed oil, regular sunflower oil, regular safflower oil and corn oil.In excess, these oils promote inflammation in the body.

There are very few cooking oils high in omega 3 fatty acids, and the oils that are high omega 3 fatty acids, such as flax oil, tend to break down too quickly for high-heat cooking.

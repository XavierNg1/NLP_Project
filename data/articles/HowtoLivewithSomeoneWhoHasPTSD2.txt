 Seeking help from a mental health care provider (a psychiatrist or psychologist) is a very important part of recovering from PTSD. Going to therapy as early as possible once the PTSD has appeared is preferable, as early treatment can mean a faster recovery.People with PTSD can also seek help in a community-based center or clinic.
The longer symptoms are allowed to continue without the help of a mental health care provider, the harder it will be to change and recover from those behaviors.
 If your loved one has agreed to go to treatment, make it easier for them by gathering information on different therapists.


You can also set up an appointment for them once your loved one has determined which therapist they would like to talk to .
 If your loved one refuses to get treatment, go to a counselor yourself and discuss the challenges you are facing when dealing with your loved one’s PTSD. The counselor may be able to give you some tips on how to handle your loved one’s symptoms and refusal to get help.


Tell your loved one that you went to see a therapist. Telling them about your experience will normalize going to a psychiatrist, which may make them feel better about seeking help themselves.
 If your loved one is having a hard time accepting the need to go to therapy, tell them that you will go to therapy with them. Therapy for families of people suffering from PTSD can be found in many community clinics.

 Depending on the type of travel you are doing, choose either a backpack or a suitcase.


Suitcases are great for vacations that are wholly urban, at resorts or wherever else, while backpacks are better for backpacking expeditions, country travel, rough travel and travel in areas with few amenities and concrete paths.

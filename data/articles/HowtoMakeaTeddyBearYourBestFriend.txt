 You don't have to get a bear, though. It could be any animal you like. Look for stuffed animals in your interest at toy stores and yard sales. Before buying, look for any gross stains or rips. Get another model of that stuffed animal, if you like it.
 Write down a profile of your pet. Make a birth certificate in it to make everything more official. If you can, get a picture of your stuffed animal and glue it into one of the pages. Write fake hobbies like, playing soccer, cooking, etc., Talking to your teddy bear will calm him down a little. He may be scared in his new home so hug him and maybe give him a toy. Tell him about your past teddy bears or maybe about your teddy bears. Do not just leave him alone.
 Are you going to the mall with your friends? Great, take him with you. Your friends may laugh but your good friends may be nice and then become your teddy's "auntie". If you are going to have dinner, take him to the table and place some pillows under him so he can see over the table.
 Make sure you give him some of your dinner. And don't worry if he doesn't eat a lot. Teddy bears have very small stomachs and he may not want to be rude by stuffing himself!

, That's right! In the morning, dress him up, brush his teeth and settle him in your backpack with his head sticking out. Not only will be a smart bear, but he can make some new friends!

, Take him shopping at Build a Bear or make him some clothes. Get to know his sense of style as well. This will help you guys bond and let him express himself.
 He can share your bed or he can have his own bed. Build a Bear has a bed and American Girl does too. Or you can make him a bed yourself!

, Love him and talk to him everyday. Buy him stuff and cuddle him all the time and you two will be best friends!

, Tell your bear stories. Your bear loves to hear about your day, his ancestors, and everything you have to tell him.,

 It is most effective to make the cuts straight downwards (vertical), as this will provide the proper angle for the lawn edging. Push your spade down below the level of the grass roots (at least 10 inches). Now, lever the handle of your spade downward to lift up the sod you wish to remove. This completely loosens all of the grass roots.;
, Turn the sods upside down and hit the soil-laden roots with the flat part of your spade to loosen the soil. Don't cut the roots with the edge of your spade as this will create root cuttings that will grow if left in your flower bed. Shake out this soil into your flower bed. Toss the sods in your compost upside down where they can decompose, if you so desire.
 For example, if you are using 4-inch deep lawn edging, the trench will be 5 inches deep on the grass side.
 The edging will have a natural curl from being wound into a circle for packaging. Unroll the circle so that the outside of the curl faces your flower bed.
 The top of the edging DOES NOT stick above the lawn; it will be almost buried and just visible after you back fill your trench!

,, These are installed horizontally at the base of the lawn edging by hammering them through the edging, just above the reinforcement strip into the soil under the lawn. They are *not* placed vertically.
 The level of the soil should come up to, but not above, the top of the edging. Adjust the soil height as needed and tamp again.
 When you mow the lawn, you can run one wheel on the soil, right over the edging and have no trimming to do.

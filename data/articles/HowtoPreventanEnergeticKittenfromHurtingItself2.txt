 Instead of allowing your energetic kitten to take part in potentially dangerous activities, provide your kitten with plenty of appropriate toys. There are a variety of cat toys available from pet supply stores. In many instances kittens will happily play with toys by themselves., Kittens can also expend energy by climbing and playing on a cat tree. These can be purchased at your local pet supply store and provide kittens with an opportunity to jump up to different perches. They also include scratching posts for your kitten to play with. These are fun and safe objects for kittens., If your kitten is motivated by food, try giving it a food puzzle. Place a few of your kittenâ€™s favourite treats inside the puzzle. Then, your kitten will spend time playing with the toy in order to access the treats. This is a safe way to occupy and tire out an energetic kitten.

 It's best to visit a spot where event flyers tend to get posted, not the laundromat, where it's mostly babysitting, housecleaning, and appliances for sale. Scan the flyers and note which ones stand out to you the most. Take a closer look: What made those flyers stand out to you? Keep that in mind as you continue with these steps.;
, Size matters, especially among a flurry of other flyers.
 Neon paper will grab the most attention on its own, but it can overpower the text or pictures. Consider using a color that's bright but still soft enough to create contrast with dark ink (e.g. sky blue). Or, if you do stick with a neon color, use a dark color for the text and images.
 The picture you choose will depend on your audience, but no matter what, make sure it has high enough contrast and saturation that it "pops".
 The funky fonts may look good on your computer, and work well on a handbill or some other type of pamphlet, but they are hard to read from a distance and donâ€™t photocopy well. Use simple, bold fonts that are easily read and will not distort after being copied 150 times.
 It's tempting to cram every square inch of the flyer with words and graphics, but sometimes having "whitespace" around your headlines and images can make them stand out better.
 Test your flyer by hanging it up and taking 4-5 big steps back- you should be able to read the headline from this distance.
 This will ensure that your poster is posted before others, and help publicize your event early on. Check back later and re-post your flyer if necessary.

 Keep in mind that some people have had mixed results with this method. It only works if your hairdryer can get very hot and if the label is not that stubborn to remove., The heat of the hairdryer will make the glue dry out and turn brittle. This will make the label easier to peel off.
 If needed, use your fingernail or a razor blade to help peel the label off. If it doesn't peel off easily, heat the label for another 45 seconds, then try it again., Put a few drops of olive oil into a paper towel, and gently rub any residue spots away.Wash the jar using warm, soapy water to get rid of the oil, then pat it dry with a clean towel.

Fertility drugs that help hormone levels get back on track are available for both men and women. Often, doctors recommend hormone therapy when the cause for infertility is unknown, even after testing. Hormone therapy may also be used in conjunction with another treatment.
For patients with blockages and scarring within the reproductive system, surgery can provide a permanent resolution. Surgery may also be recommended for patients with fibroids, ovarian cysts, endometriosis or genetic defects.
Artificial insemination could be the solution to unexplained infertility. Injecting a concentrated amount of sperm directly into the uterus during ovulation is a simple fertility treatment when there is no known medical reason that is preventing the couple from conceiving.
If less invasive fertility treatments fail, artificial reproductive technology, such as in vitro fertilization and zygote intrafallopian transfer, can take over for biology. For men with low sperm count or low sperm motility, introcytoplasmic sperm injection allows the doctor to inject sperm directly into harvested mature eggs. In some instances, the woman is not producing viable eggs, in which case an egg donor is needed.
For men with issues such as premature ejaculation or impotence, medication can help address these problems and increase the couple’s chance of becoming pregnant.
A wide variety of fertility drugs are available to help women who aren’t ovulating on their own. In some cases, the doctor may prescribe medication that stimulates the ovaries to produce mature eggs.

 Turn on the shower in your home and wait until the water is comfortably hot. Again, the water should not be too hot, as it will be in direct contact with the cap and can ruin the hat’s construction if the temperature is too high or the cap is allowed to soak too long.Showering in a hat or pair of boots you wish to break in is a trick that has been used for a long time with great results.
 Take the cap you’ll be modifying and put it on. You should position the hat the way you most frequently wear it so that it loosens and dries in the right shape.
 Hop in the shower with the cap on. Shower as you ordinarily would, or simply wait 3—5 minutes for the rigidity of the hat to break down and assume its new shape. Make sure the crown of the cap is thoroughly wet so that it can be stretched out uniformly.If you decide to simply take a regular shower while wearing the cap, be sure not to get soap or shampoo on the hat as it soaks. Washing your cap should be performed separately with the right products.
Let most of the water fall on the crown of the cap to avoid potentially ruining the bill.
 Leave the cap on as you go about your day. Shake out excess water before putting on your other clothes so that the cap doesn’t drip. The cap should dry within a day, or less, depending on environmental conditions.


Wearing the cap on a clear, warm day will allow it to dry most efficiently. If the weather outside is cold or rainy, do not wear the cap out. Instead, allow it to sit right-side-up under a fan or in front of an air conditioning vent and check on its progress periodically.

 When you have the empirical formula of a chemical compound and you need to find the molecular formula of that same chemical compound, you can find the scaling factor you need by dividing the molar mass of the compound by the molar mass of the empirical formula.

For example, you might need to find the molar mass of an H2O compound with a molar mass of 54.05 g/mol. 

The molar mass of H2O is 18.0152 g/mol.

Find the scaling factor by dividing the molar mass of the compound by the molar mass of the empirical formula:

Scaling factor = 54.05 / 18.0152 = 3




, Multiply the subscripts of each element within the empirical formula by the scaling factor you just calculated. This will give you the molecular formula of the chemical compound sample involved in the problem.

For example, to find the molecular formula of the compound in question, multiply the subscripts of H20 by the scaling factor of 3.

H2O * 3 = H6O3




, With this answer, you have successfully found the answer for the empirical formula as well as the molecular formula of the chemical compound involved in the problem.

For example, the scaling factor for the compound is 3. The molecular formula of the compound is H6O3.

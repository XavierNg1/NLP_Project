 Put together some strategic questions for an online survey to circulate to your emailing lists. They don’t have to be elaborate or conform strictly to the scientific method. Simple surveys can still be effective.
 You might be more familiar with using a word processing platform or spreadsheet, but a dedicated survey tool is better. Consider using one such as Constant Contact or SurveyMonkey that aggregates results for you.These tools also have helpful features and types of surveys and questions that you might not have thought about.
 Decide from the outset which type of information you’re looking to learn so you can be specific and focused. Ask the most important questions first. That way, you can get your most important topics addressed before a respondent tunes out or skips to the end.


Make the survey user friendly and brief. Ask multiple-choice or “closed” questions: ones that can be answered with one word or phrase. This makes results easier to analyze for you, and it makes questions easier to answer for your respondents.
Introduce some variety to your queries. You might add some yes-or-no’s to your multiple choice questions, or you could have them answer some queries on a scale of 1 to 10, for example. This might also be the exception to the rule of sticking to closed questions. You could ask an open-ended question or two for variety’s sake.
 A good survey should help you find out what your customers really value, and may give insight into how they search for you. Then, you can place yourself on the other end of that search. Survey tools also usually provide pie charts and other graphics to help you visualize results or to use in presentations.

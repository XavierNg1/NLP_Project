 This version can be played with three to ten people, and requires one standard 52 card deck. Remove the jokers from the deck. Place the ace of spades face up in the middle of the circle so that all players can reach it.;
, It's okay if it's not exact, but the players' hands shouldn't differ by more than one card. Players may look at their hands, but must keep them private. The cards should be kept visible at all times.
 He/she must find any 2s he/she has and place them on top of the ace face down and say, "one 2" or "three 2s" etc. However, if s/he doesn't have any 2s, s/he must pick one or multiple cards and bluff. Play goes clockwise.


You can bluff with as many as four cards, but the fewer cards you play when bluffing, the more believable the bluff will be, as it would be unlikely to have all four 2s in your hand. Bluffing with a number of cards higher than one is riskier, but the payoff is greater because you get rid of more cards.
 The next player must put down all his/her 3s, the next player 4s, and so on. After Kings, the play goes back to Aces. As with the first turn, if at any time a player doesn't have any cards of the next rank, he/she must bluff, and risk having to pick up the whole pile. There is no pass option.
 If at any point in the game a player thinks another is bluffing, he/she can say "Bluff!" right after the cards are set down. If the challenged cards were not what the player said they were, the player who bluffed must take all the cards from the pile. However, if the player didn't bluff, the challenger must take all of the cards from the pile.]


After the challenge is settled, the next player takes his/her turn with the next rank of cards.
 This ends the game, and that player has won.

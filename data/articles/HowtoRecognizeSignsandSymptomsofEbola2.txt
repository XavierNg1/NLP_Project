 This virus is also known as Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever. This is because the virus causes roughly half of Ebola patients to lose blood from puncture sites, or from mucosal membranes (such as the lips and gums). This bleeding occurs because the virus causes damage to the blood vessels.This bleeding can also occur around the ears, eyes, nose, and anus. It may also cause blood to appear in stool.
 If you have contracted Ebola, you will begin to vomit frequently. The virus creates chemical abnormalities that the body considers poison, which leads to vomiting.
 Since intestinal and gastric cells are being damaged by the virions of Ebola, you may begin to experience frequent diarrhea.


Diarrhea is defined as loose, watery stool that occurs at least three times a day.
 As the virus multiplies in the body, it can weaken systems, including the digestive system. The virus may begin attacking endothelial cells, which are located in the stomach; when this occurs, you may lose your appetite.
 This rash generally appears roughly five days after you have been infected with the virus. The rash is caused by increased levels of histamine in your body.This rash is often prominent on the chest, though it can also cover the rest of your body. The rash will look like numerous red dots, that may be raised, though sometimes they are not raised.
 Virus particles in the gastrointestinal tract will also damage and attack hepatocytes which are cells found in the liver. If this occurs, the liver will leak bilirubin (a yellowing substance produced in the liver) into the blood vessels. When excessive bilirubin is in the blood it may cause jaundice to occur.


Jaundice causes the skin and whites of the eyes to take on a yellowish color.

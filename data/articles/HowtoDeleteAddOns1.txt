 If you've got an add-on or toolbar installed that you don't want to use anymore, you can remove it from Internet Explorer. To do so, click Tools â†’ Manage Add-ons.;
, This can be selected in the left frame, and is usually selected by default. A list of installed add-ons will be listed in the main frame of the window.
 There may be multiple add-ons installed by a single program. Click Disable to turn the extension off.
 After disabling the add-on, you will need to uninstall the add-on software from your computer. You can do this from the Windows program manager.


Open the Control Panel. You can access the Control Panel from the Start menu. Windows 8 users can press Ctrl+X and select Control Panel from the menu.
Select "Add/Remove Programs" or "Programs and Features".
Find the add-on in the list of installed programs. The full list of programs may take a few moments to load.
Select the add-on and click Uninstall. The Uninstall button is located at the top of the list.
 If you can't get the toolbar to go away, chances are it's malicious and will require some extra work to delete. See this guide for detailed instructions.

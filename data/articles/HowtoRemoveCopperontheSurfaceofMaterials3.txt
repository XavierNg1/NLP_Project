 Depending on the size of the object you plan to grind, you might use a grinding wheel, a sander, or even a sand blaster. A sander is best suited for minimal abrasion to break through a thin layer of copper. A grinding wheel will be more aggressive and help you cut through a thicker layer of copper, but the sandblaster will be ideal for removing copper from a larger object.


You should also consider the material underneath the copper. If you are dealing with a soft metal or plastic, a grinding wheel might do more damage than a sander or sand blaster.
 Grinding removes the copper layer mechanically instead of chemically. This means that you will likely have to press pretty hard with a sander or grinding wheel. You should also be wearing goggles and a respirator.Inhaling metal shavings can be dangerous.
Metal shavings can cut your eyes if they get in them.
 Once you have removed the copper layer, you will notice grooves and marks left on the material underneath. This happens because once you break through the copper layer, you begin to grind the surface of the material. Smooth out the surface of the material by sanding those grooves down with a finer sandpaper, and wiping the surface clean.For example, you might use a 180 grit sandpaper to get out the initial scratches, and the move to a 300 grit sandpaper to smooth things out even more (a higher grit produces finer scratches).
 If you are removing copper from the surface of another metal, you might need to polish that metal afterward. Most metals have specific polishes that you can buy commercially, such as aluminum polish or chrome polish. Apply the polish according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions to make your metal shine and protect it from the environment.

 If your shoes tend to squeak when you're sweating or going sock-less, it may be due to moisture. Drying the shoes may help. Before drying your shoes, remove any soles or inserts. Hang them to dry in a warm, dry room., Once the soles have been removed, place crumpled newspaper inside your shoes. Old newspapers can soak up some of the moisture. You do not need to use more than a couple of sheets. If your shoes are sopping wet, you might want to replace the newspaper every few hours., If you want your shoes to dry faster, consider placing them on a shoe tree. A shoe tree will also help them maintain their shape as leather shoes especially might stretch or shrink when wet.

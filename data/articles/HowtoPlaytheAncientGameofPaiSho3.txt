Non-flowers


Knotweed: May be placed on any point. When played, all pieces that are next to knotweed orthogonally (or at a right angle to) are dead. Any piece, even the owner of the knotweed's pieces, that is placed or moved next to a knotweed is dead. Knotweed may not move, or be moved by other pieces. The point of this tile is to lessen your opponent's tiles, and therefore their points.

Wheel: When played, rotate clock-wise the pieces that are immediately around it. Wheels cannot be moved by any tile but another wheel. At the end, each player loses 1 extra point for each wheel they have on the board, even if they are considered dead.

Boat: Use this piece to "push" another piece orthogonally as well as the piece next to it. This may only be done if there is an empty space behind the second piece that the boat tile is moving (which would be behind the first piece), and if the move is normally legal.

Rock: Players may not play or move a piece so that it is next to an opponent's rock, orthogonally or diagonally.



Special Tiles


White Dragon: Harmony with the Lilly and Rose. Disharmony with Rhododendron.

White Lotus: Players gain 1 point for each piece that they own within 3 spaces from a White Lotus at the end of the game. No harmonies or disharmonies. This tile is a "wild card."

 A window that faces west or south may provide the best light and the most warmth. Chili peppers thrive on full sun, so place your plants as close to the window as possible to maximize sun exposure.
 If you are unable to provide your chili peppers with enough natural light indoors, place them beneath a grow light, instead. The lights should be positioned approximately six inches above the plants, and your peppers need the light to remain on for 14 to 16 hours each day in order to receive enough warmth and light.
 Open a window or turn a fan on low for a few hours each day. Ideally, the air should remain room temperature to moderately warm. Continual hot or cold drafts could hinder growth, however, so keep your peppers away from air conditioning and heating vents.
 When the surface of the soil is just barely dry to the touch, give your chili peppers more water. Water the plant until excess water begins to drain out of the container's bottom hole.
 Use a balanced 15-15-15 fertilizer containing nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium.


The three numbers on a bag of fertilizer refer to the percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium that fertilizer contains. A 15-15-15 fertilizer has equal parts of all three elements, meaning that the foliage, root system, flowers, and fruit of your pepper plant all receive an equal dose of food. Nitrogen improves the foliage, potassium improves the flowering and overall strength of a plant, and phosphorus improves the roots and fruit.
 Note the standard size and color—red, orange, yellow, or green—for the variety of chili pepper you chose to plant. Once your peppers reach these specifications, use shears or scissors to snip the stem directly above the pepper. Chili pepper plants can take 90 days after germination to yield peppers that are ready for harvest.

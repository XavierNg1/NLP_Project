 The bigger it is, the harder it is to do and the more uncomfortable. Pick what suits your needs for what you will be doing and how long you will be wearing your packer. Decide realistic or non-realistic. This is up to you. If you are playing with a partner, think about their needs and wants.
 Put it on like normal and then loosen the straps carefully but not so that it falls off. Put your undies of choice over your packer - loose boxers are better if your packer is large, and sometimes getting a size larger than you need makes it less of a squeeze. Move the tip of your packer so it is tucked under the waistband of your undies. Then add pants.
 You don't need loose boxers for this, tighter might be better in some cases. Cis men should never do this as it cuts off circulation to a flesh and blood penis and can cause injury.

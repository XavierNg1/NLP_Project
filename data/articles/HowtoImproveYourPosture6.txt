 To keep your entire musculoskeletal system in tune to support your posture, it's important to keep yourself in shape. Try these tips:









Lie on your back, with your legs bent to about 90 degrees at the knee, and your feet on the floor.
Pull your belly-button towards your spine and holding it at the end. This is a different type of contraction than crunches (crunches feel like they are more at the front of your stomach, while this feels like it is more inwards and towards your back).
Hold for ten seconds, repeat eight times. Repeat it daily.
Maintain the proper posture even if you are getting tired and are not using other muscles like your back or butt muscles.
Breathe normally during this exercise, as you are training your core to be able to maintain this position during normal activities in daily life.

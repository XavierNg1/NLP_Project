 If you’re in pain, the idea of exercising might seem very unappealing; however, exercise is one of the best ways to get an endorphin release. Endorphins are what cause the famous "runner's high," or feelings of contentment, happiness, and joy. You can even choose a type of exercise that will help mitigate the kind of pain you have.You don’t need to do anything particularly strenuous to get an endorphin release. You can take a water fitness class or simply go for a brisk walk. Tai chi and yoga can also be gentle ways to exercise.
Anything that gets your blood circulating more than average will stimulate an endorphin release. Try biking slowly, canoeing, ballroom dancing, gardening, walking briskly, or water aerobics. Do what you can and ask your doctor for advice if you need to.;
, In order to get an endorphin release, you need to exercise for a sustained period of time. Try to exercise for at least 20 minutes at a time. If you can exercise for closer to 45 or 60 minutes, that’s even better.It is recommended you aim for a total of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise every week. You can break this up into smaller chunks of time to make this more manageable.Pace yourself. Exercise at a lower intensity level for a longer period of time.
Listen to your body. If something hurts, stop and take a rest. It’s not worth hurting yourself in order to get an endorphin rush. That defeats the purpose!

, Studies have shown that group fitness helps boost endorphins partly because of the social aspect. You can take a class at a gym or form an exercise group on your own.In one study of note, group fitness improved mood in older women suffering from an acute illness.Find other people who are in similar physical shape as you. That way, you’ll all be able to agree on a pace or level of intensity.
Gyms and yoga studios often offer classes for people with limited mobility. If your pain prevents you from doing certain physical activities, these may be good options for you.

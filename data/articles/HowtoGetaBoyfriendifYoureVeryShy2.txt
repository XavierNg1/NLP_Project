 One way of getting out there is by volunteering for a good organization.Consider what you enjoy doing like volunteering with a theater crew, nonprofit, or food bank. Try to pick a group you know has other people your age. If you are in school, talk to a guidance counselor about popular volunteering organizations.


The beauty of volunteering is that it forces you to interact with a team, that might have a dream boy, while doing positive work for a community.
 A good way to meet and interact with boys is within a group setting instead of a party. Look at various clubs and organizations that interest you like: theater tech, magazine, speech and debate, or another club that interests you. You don’t have to be loud to get noticed. When you’re in an environment you enjoy, you will feel more confident.


Focus on the group instead of trying to impress boys with your knowledge of the group.
Acting out of passion is an attractive quality that will put you on the radar., A good way of meeting new people is by playing pick up co ed sports. Talk to some of your friends about joining together so you have your own support group. Once you start a season, the boys on your team will begin to know your name. Even if you aren’t into anyone on your team, making more friends and connections will increase your social network.


If you aren’t sports inclined, don’t try picking up sports for a boy.
 Even if you’re under 21, you can still go out and see bands or comedy acts. Go with a group of your friends and just be out there. Go to an event that you actually care about.Once you’re there, you’ll probably make eye contact with a boy who is also shy and loves Tegan and Sara.


If you have a crush on a particular boy, try to find out what kind of events he goes to.
Even if you don’t strike up a great chat with anyone new, at least you got yourself out there. You probably caught the eye of someone who might be on the lookout for you at future events.

 Sometimes your dog will just wake you up because they’re bored or they want to play. In this case, you should command your dog to lay down and go back to sleep.


Use a command like “lay down.” This should get your dog to stop pawing you and licking your face.
Say your chosen command in a stern voice.
Use the command only once.
You may want to point to the ground as you say the command.
Training your dog by commands might take several weeks. Don’t lose patience – your dog will eventually learn., If you reward your dog with attention for waking you up, you will train them to repeat the behavior. Ignore your dog's efforts except for that single "lay down" command — even prolonged scolding can be a "reward." When it is time to get up, spend a little time on your own activities instead of walking directly to the food bowl.


Remember, though, your dog might genuinely have to go to the bathroom. Don’t make them suffer because you want another twenty minutes of sleep., Depending on your dog’s general health, you may have to adjust your lifestyle, habits, and schedule to your dog’s needs. By adjusting to your dog’s needs, you’ll reduce the chance that they’ll wake you up. Consult your vet if your dog's medication or feeding schedule makes it difficult for you to sleep.

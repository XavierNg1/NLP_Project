 This is important because your slow connection could be due to a problem on their end, not yours. The exact speed should be on your bill. If you don't have a bill handy, you can check the ISP's website or contact them directly to find out.
 If you get a low result, try another computer on your network first. If both get a low result, contact your ISP. If only yours has a problem, then the problem lies with the computer.
 If you’ve been using the same speed for years, you probably aren’t equipped to load today’s web pages, which are more intricate than ever. In particular, you might be missing out on streaming and downloading opportunities. If you’ve had the same provider for a long time, ask for a discounted upgrade in exchange for your continued loyalty. Otherwise, shop around for deals; many companies offer incentives if you switch to them.

 This is more of a coconut shortbread-type cookie. Because there is no egg in this recipe, the dough may seem a bit more crumbly. If your dough is too dry and crumbly after beating the ingredients together, add 1 to 2 tablespoons cream or soft butter. Add them in 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough looks wet and sticks together.Itâ€™s also important to measure out all the ingredients properly. Use metal or plastic measuring cups for the dry ingredients. Do not tap or shake the cup when measuring. Instead, level off any excess amount by running a straight edge knife across the top of the cup.
To prepare the butter for this recipe, make sure it is softened but not melted. If possible, let the butter sit at room temperature 30-45 minutes before you plan to make the cookie dough.
 If you are using an electric mixer to beat together the ingredients, use the mixer bowl. If you are beating the ingredients together by hand, use a regular mixing bowl.
 Pour 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 cups sugar, 2 cups butter, softened, 1 tablespoon baking powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda, and 1 teaspoon vanilla into the mixing bowl.


Beat the ingredients at low speed until well mixed.
Scrape the sides of the bowl often with a spatula.
 Make sure the coconut flakes are the sweetened kind to add the right amount of sweetness to these cookies.
 Shape each half into a 12 x 2 inch log.
 Refrigerate both logs for at least 2 hours to firm up the dough.
, Place each slice 2 inches apart on cookie sheets.


This recipe should make about 8 dozen cookies. If you want to make less than 8 dozen cookies in one sitting, halve the recipe.
 The edges should be lightly golden and brown.
 Then, place the cookies on a cooling rack.

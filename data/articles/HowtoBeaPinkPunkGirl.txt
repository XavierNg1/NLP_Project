a black t-shirt with a pink t-shirt under it, and the ends of the pink sleeves and the pink neck are just showing
a short sleeved black t-shirt with a long sleeved pink t-shirt under it

 Black boxers with a pink waistband are good. make sure that they are easily seen.
 Good ones are vans, converse or skate shoes.
 Using an old black school tie, cut a hole in it, and secure pink and black striped material behind the holes using safety pins. This step is optional.
 This step is a bit extreme, but it will make you stand out.
 This gives you a freaky edge and looks great. Use bright pink eyeshadow. Don't make the makeup too dark though.

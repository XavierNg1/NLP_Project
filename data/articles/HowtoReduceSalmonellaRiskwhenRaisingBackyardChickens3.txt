However, in some circumstances medical intervention may be necessary.If your illness lasts longer than a few days, see a doctor. You should also see a doctor if you have a high fever or bloody stools.
Infants or young children that have been infected should see a doctor.
 Certain medications can help with the symptoms of a salmonella infection. If you have a severe diarrhea, take over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medications. Make sure you check to see if any medications you're taking interact with over-the-counter medications.If you're sick enough to need medical help, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection. However, do not take antibiotics unless instructed to do so by your doctor. Antibiotics can actually be harmful for a mild case of salmonella.

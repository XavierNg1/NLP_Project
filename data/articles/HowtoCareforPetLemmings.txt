 They are sociable creatures although they do tend to play fight a lot, which can be scary to watch at first but you will soon get used to them running around, fighting over which one gets to play on the toys. Two females are the better option here as two males will tend to fight more often and occasionally, it can get nasty.;
, Two lemmings will happily gnaw through the cardboard box the pet shop provides them in, in about an hour and unless you want to be searching endlessly around your home for the fast little critters, make sure that everything is ready so that you can pop them in the cage as soon as you get home. The cage itself needs to be big enough for them to run around in happily, ideally a tank with a well ventilated lid as they do need a minimum of 6 inches (15.2Â cm) of a decent substrate to burrow in.
 Toilet roll tubes are great because they can munch their way through them as well as running in and out of them and this makes for cheap lemming entertainment. Small houses and rodent hammocks also provide hours of fun but they will be destroyed fairly quickly. You should provide the lemmings with a small empty, clean box for them to make a nest in but make sure that there are two exits from the box because they do have a tendency to get a bit territorial. All of that plus at least one wheel for exercise (one wheel for every two lemmings is better as they do tend to squabble over who gets to use it) and your lemmings will be more than happy.
 They are naturally sugar intolerant creatures so you cannot feed them hamster and other types of rodent food that you get from a pet store. Most large stores will be able to provide you with specific lemming food. Degu food is a very good alternative as these do not contain added sugars and, when mixed with millet and alfafa hay, it provides complete nutrition. You cannot feed your pet lemmings fruit or anything that naturally contains sugar as this will make them rather ill.

 Focus on releasing tension in your masseter muscle, which is your primary chewing muscle. It covers the sides of your jaws, just behind your cheeks.To massage your jaw muscles, place your hands on the notches just below your cheekbones. Your fingers should be about one inch in front of your ears.
Press this notch firmly and rub it. This is a sturdy spot on your face, so don’t be afraid to apply firm pressure inward and upward.
 Do this by positioning the tip of your tongue between your teeth. This will prevent your jaw from clenching or grinding., This is where you slur your speech as though you are sleepy or drunk.Begin by saying the sentence: “I am so relaxed I can hardly talk”. Then, say it again but this time slur each word. Try this again by mouthing the words: “I can talk”, slurring each word as you mouth the sentence.
 This is exercise will relax your jaw by spending long periods of time with your jaw wide open.Hold your mouth wide enough to fit two fingers between your teeth.
Try to hold your mouth wide in this position for about an hour.
If you catch yourself with your teeth together or your mouth closed, slowly stretch your mouth open again.

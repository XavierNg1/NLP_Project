 It should mention this somewhere in the user manual. If you don't have the user manual, look for a button on the radio that reads "FM Set" or something like that. Play around with the button until a number 64 appears on the screen.;
, That probably means that you can't change the FM start point on your radio, but you can still get channel 6 by tuning to the lowest point on your radio's FM dial (which should be around 87 megahertz). Try tuning the radio to get the channel exactly (you may get "images" of the station, but it will come in clearer if you find the real one).
 Channel 3 can be heard on 64-66 mHz, channel 4 on 66-72 mHz, channel 5 on 76-82 mHz, and channel 6 on 82-88 mHz.

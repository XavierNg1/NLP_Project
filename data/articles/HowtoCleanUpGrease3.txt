 Believe it or not, oil can be extremely useful for loosening the hold of greasy messes. Most cleaning experts recommend using a natural, scent-free oil that won’t cause saturation or discoloration, like vegetable or mineral oil.If you don’t have a bottle of mineral oil around, baby oil will also get the job done.
Avoid dark oils that might potentially stain porous, light-colored surfaces.
 The simplest way to do this is the hold the washcloth over the mouth of the bottle, then turn the bottle upside down so that it soaks a circular spot. This spot will provide just enough oil to clean greasy messes without adding to problem.








Be careful not to glob the oil on too heavily, or you may have trouble getting it all off.
 Work the oil into the stain using a forceful circular motion. The oil will cut through the grease, which will be absorbed by the dry portion of the washcloth. Keep rubbing until you’ve removed all the grease, applying more oil as needed.








Press the tip of your finger into the spot beneath the washcloth to create a more focused scrubbing area.
For a deeper clean, try scouring dried or burnt-on grease with an abrasive sponge or toothbrush after you’ve applied the oil.
 When you’re cleaning grease from materials like wood and unsealed stone, it may not be a good idea to leave behind large quantities of oil. Once the grease is gone, buff out the last traces of oil with a towel or chamois. The end result will be a spotless surface that’s polished, glowing and totally grease-free.









A thin layer of oil can actually help protect natural materials by repelling moisture, which could otherwise lead to warping, swelling and cracking over time.
Don’t try to rinse off the oil using water—this will just cause it to bead up and collect on the surface.

 In the broad majority of cases, it will be very easy to figure out where you need to scratch. Other times, it may actually take some time before you're able to pinpoint. If you're having trouble figuring out where the itch is on your body, take a few seconds to relax and get in touch with your body. Scratching lightly in big circles should help you find the spot quickly enough.
 While some occasional light scratching isn't usually a problem, it's still preferable to try other things first. An itch is most often the symptom of an underlying problem, most often dry skin. Moisturizing your skin with an emollient may remove the need for scratching to begin with. Give the itchy area some moisture, and see if the itching stops. It may well be that your skin was simply trying to tell you something all along! Use a wet compress if you have an irritated area. Put a clean hand towel in a bowl of warm water and several drops of essential oils. Wring it out and apply to the afflicted area. You should feel a sensation of pleasant relief within several seconds. Other mild itching may go away within seconds if left unattended.
As a general rule, drinking a lot of water throughout the day will help to keep the rest of your body hydrated.
 When it comes time to actually scratch, it's important to keep your scratching limited to small, slow and steady circular movements. Keep your touch light and gentle. Scratch on and around the itchy area. Within a few seconds, the itch should go away.


As with most things, it's best to keep your scratching within moderation. Anything more than a light scratch could actually exacerbate the scratch you're trying to solve!
Limit yourself to scratching sessions of 30 seconds maximum.

 One way to promote sleep and help calm the mind down is to cool yourself down. Being too hot can disturb your sleep, which can keep your imagination going. Lower the temperature in the room or remove a blanket to help cool yourself down.








Keep your room between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit., Taking a bath raises your temperature, and then going into your cool bedroom lowers it. This change in body temperature causes you to be drowsy because of a decrease in metabolic activity.








Try burning scented candles or using aromatherapy bath salts or body wash. Or burn essential oil or place it in a diffuser. Lavender and Roman chamomile oil both promotes sleep., Exercise helps you fall asleep more quickly and sleep better. It can help tire your mind and body so you can hit the pillow and drift off. Make sure that you exercise at least 3 hours before bedtime. If you have trouble falling asleep, try exercising even earlier in the day.
 Deep breathing can be effective in calming the body and the mind. Sit up straight on the floor just before bed. Make sure the lights are off and the room is quiet without any distractions.









Close your mouth and inhale through your nose for a count of 4. Hold your breath for a count of 7.
Exhale completely through your mouth for a count of 8.
Do this for a total of 4 times., Some teas can have a calming effect on the body and the mind. An hour or so before you want to fall asleep, brew a cup of chamomile, Valerian, or lavender tea. Some tea companies also sell blends specifically for helping sleeping.








Don't put sugar in the tea. This can help you stay awake.

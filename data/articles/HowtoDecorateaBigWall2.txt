 If you have a lot of books, or a collection of figures youâ€™d like to display, shelves can really make the space look sophisticated.You can purchase a book shelf, and secure it to the wall, or you can install shelves directly on the wall.


You can then decorate the shelves with books, figurines, vinyl records, or a combination of many different things.
Make sure you clean the shelves often, as they tend to collect a layer of dust rather quickly.
 For a more regal look, you can install wall sconces.A sconce is a decorative wall bracket for holding candles or lights. These come in a number of different designs, and may have electric lights or a place to install a candle that you can light. Installing one or two large sconces will give your wall a new look, especially if you also install a large portrait or photograph.


Be careful when burning candles! Do not leave a lit candle unattended.
 If the wall is very tall, you can use tall furniture to help break it up. For example, by placing chairs or sofas which have high backs against the wall. These pieces will help break up the wall because they provide something interesting to look at, and take up some of the wall space.You can also try placing one or two tall plants next to the wall. These will have the same effect as the furniture, but make sure the plants can survive with the amount of light they will receive in that area.Be sure to keep the plant healthy and well-pruned! If the plant is brown and wilting, it will create an eye-sore in the room.

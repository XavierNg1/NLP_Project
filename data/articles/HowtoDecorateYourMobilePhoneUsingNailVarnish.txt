 If you are a minor (18 or under) get permission from your parents or guardian to do this.;
, Using some cotton wool, clean your mobile phone for a smooth finish, trying to avoid any buttons.
 You can choose many colours or two colours or even just one. Once you have decided, set your choice(s) out on a flat work surface and put your mobile on the angle you wish in order to work on it.


Note: If it's your first ever time doing this, glitter or see-through nail varnish is recommended. (It still looks great.)

, With a piece of paper, get your starting colour and open it. Don't hit it on the side of the rim, instead quickly make a tiny dot on the paper, then another which is slightly bigger until you get to the biggest size. If you want to paint an area instead of a dot, practice painting lines, curves, and squares on the paper. Keep doing it until you are aware of how much pressure you need to apply to get the size you want.


Note: Only move on to the mobile when you are sure you have the touch and scale perfect. If you are, move on to the next step. You have got it. Well done!

, keypad? or whole thing? It's your choice. Just don't get the nail varnish too near to the buttons.
 Now that you have decided, it's time to finally get on with it. Take your nail varnish and dot little circles in the place you want the d√©cor to be, pulling up as you finish them. Patience and skill is the key.

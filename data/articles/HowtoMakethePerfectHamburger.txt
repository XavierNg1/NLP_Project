Wet your hands so the ground beef won't stick to them. Then, fold the seasoning into the beef until it is mixed well.;
, Grab a handful of ground beef and flatten it into a patty between your two hands. Size and thickness are up to you. Just remember that patties shrink up to 20% when you cook them.


Using your thumb, create an indentation in the middle of each patty. This helps the patties keep their shape on the grill. You can use wax paper to keep the patties separate.
 You can cook them over a grill or a barbecue. Close the lid, and grill for 5 to 10 minutes. Keep a close eye on them. Hamburger meat contains a lot of fat which can cause flare-ups and burned burgers.


Flip the patties only once and leave them to cook for another five minutes, or until they've reached perfection.
Remove the patties and turn the heat to low. Toast the hamburger buns for 30 seconds.
 Add lettuce, pickles, then the beef. Finish with a slice of tomato, onions and mustard and ketchup.
 Enjoy this delicious hamburger!

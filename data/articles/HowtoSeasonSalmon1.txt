 Spray the foil with nonstick cooking spray. Set the oven to preheat at 400ºF (200ºC) and move onto making the seasoning.;
, Combine the brown sugar, crushed red pepper, black pepper and dry mustard in a small bowl using a fork or a small whisk. Mix it until there's an even texture throughout.
 The silvery skin should be in contact with the pan, and the pinkish flesh should be facing you. If you’re not using salmon with the skin on, then you can place it on either side.
 Coat the flesh of the salmon evenly. With your fingers, rub the dry ingredients into the flesh of the salmon.
 Reposition it with the silvery skin down, if it has skin.
 Cooking times will vary based on the thickness of your fillet. For every inch (2.5 cm) of thickness, you should cook your salmon for 10 minutes. If your fillet is 1.5 inches (4 cm) thick, then cook the fillet for 15 minutes.


Certain ovens cook differently. If yours runs out or cooks unevenly, take that into account. Keep an eye on your salmon if you're unsure.
 At the end of the cooking time, use a fork to spear the top of your fish to gently check whether or not the fish is flaky. If the pink flesh is flaky, then your salmon is done. If you prefer your salmon not to be well done, then cook it for less time.
 It's ready to serve!

 Though this seems counterintuitive, there are some studies that suggest that the aluminum in antiperspirants is the true cause of the yellow stains that often appear on clothing., Clothing that is pressed directly into the armpits is more likely to cause sweating and encourage staining. Looser clothing will be cooler and less likely to attract stains.
 Obesity often leads to increased sweating. Losing weight will cut down on the amount you sweat. Your clothing may fit more loosely, which can also help cut down on the underarm staining.
 Grapes, wheatgrass juice, tomato juice, sage tea, and raw apple cider vinegar all have properties that may reduce sweating., Using coconut oil, cornstarch, witch hazel, salt, or tea tree oil as ingredients in a homemade natural deodorant can reduce sweating. These ingredients are less likely to stain clothing than aluminum-based antiperspirant.

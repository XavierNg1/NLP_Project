 On medium heat, melt the butter or margarine until it is fully a liquid. To help the butter melt faster move a spoon around the butter in circular motions. This increases the heat for the butter and helps it melt.;
, Add the brown sugar, cinnamon, and pie filling to your saucepan. Use a wooden pan to stir the mixture around and combine all the ingredients fully together.
 Place your stove top to a higher degree and bring it to boil. This may take about five to ten minutes depending on your stove top. Keep stirring continually to prevent the pie filling from sticking in a big ball.
 Shut your stove top off and remove the saucepan from heat. Scoop the sundae in a bowl or plate so it can cool for about five minutes.
 Scoop vanilla ice cream on top of your apple spice sundae. Add desired cinnamon for extra taste. You may also add crushed nuts for more flavor. Serve and enjoy!

 Toddlers especially may not want a full 8-oz glass (237 mL) of milk, and that’s OK. If your child refuses to drink milk, try starting them off with a small amount like 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 mL). If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 mL). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.;
, Toddlers like having choices to make. By giving them the ability to make some decisions about what they eat and drink, you can spark more interest in their food.


Try making milk the beverage of choice while offering several different flavors. You could offer a choice of plain white milk, chocolate milk, or strawberry milk.
Let your child pick out their milk at the grocery store.
 The best way to do that is to serve the milk in a cup that your child likes. Whether in their favorite cup or one with a fun straw, finding ways to make your child more focused on the cup itself than what’s in the cup can make them less likely to refuse milk.
 You can buy these at the grocery store or make them at home.If your child likes these smoothies, you can then try slowly weaning them off onto plain milk.
 This will give them more ownership over their meal, and they may be more likely to want to drink the milk.
 Doing so may make your child more interested in where milk comes from.

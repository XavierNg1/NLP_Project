You can also search through Google or a different search engine for either extension.
 You should see "Video DownloadHelper" at the top of the list of search results.
 This will immediately install the extension, which should only take a few moments. You'll see the Video DownloadHelper button appear in the Firefox/Chrome toolbar.
 Go to the video streaming site and open the page of the video you want to download so that the video begins playing. You'll see the Video DownloadHelper button start animating in the browser toolbar.
 A list of possible formats and quality options will appear in a new menu.
 The option you choose can have a big impact on image quality and playability.


If you're planning on watching the video on your computer or modern mobile device, select the "1280x720" MP4 option this will work on virtually all modern computers and devices. This is usually the first option on the list.
 After selecting the format, the Save As window will appear. Navigate to the location you want to save the file to, then give the file a name.
 You can monitor the progress in the browser's Download Manager.
 Once the download is complete, you'll be able to find the video in the location you specified. If you're having difficulty getting the file to play, try VLC Player or MPC-HC. Both of these media players are free, open-source, and accept a variety of video file extensions.

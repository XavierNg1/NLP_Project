 Some comments may not need a confrontational line to be dealt with. Instead, just use a short phrase to brush them off and move on. Generally, the other person will get the picture that you don't want to talk about that.For example, if a person says, "Wow, you look like you're about to pop. It doesn't look like you'll make it to your due date," you could say, "Oh, I think we'll make it. My doctor says we're on track."

, That is, sometimes you don't need to say anything if a person makes a rude comment. A stern, silent look may be all you need to shut them down. It'll give them a moment to think about what they've said and realize it may be rude.For instance, if someone says, "You are so big! Are there triplets in there?" just give them a long look. They'll likely apologize.
 If the person who made the comment was a friend or family member, you may want to deal with the issue in private later so you don't embarrass them. Once the moment has passed, ask if you can talk to them for a minute.


You could say, "I know you're just trying to show your interest in my pregnancy, but I would appreciate it if you didn't make comments about my belly. I'm sensitive about my weight right now."

, You can simply ignore the comments people make about your pregnancy. However, that can be detrimental to your emotional health, especially if you're hearing several remarks a day. You don't want to have a lot of pent up stress or anxiety.Nonetheless, if you're truly non-confrontational, it is an option. Just make sure to relax and unwind when you get home.
 Pregnancy can be stressful enough, and if you don't feel up to dealing with the remarks, remember that you can leave whenever you want. You are not obligated to stay in an uncomfortable environment. It's okay to excuse yourself and walk away from the person or group.

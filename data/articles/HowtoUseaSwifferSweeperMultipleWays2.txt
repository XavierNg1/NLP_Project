 Get more use out of the same dry Swiffer cloth by using the second side once the first has become dirty. While the sides are slightly different textures, they work equally well for picking up dust and dirt.


Simply shake out or gently wipe away any loose debris from the dirty side of the cloth when you notice it is no longer picking up dirt, then flip it over and reattach it to your Swiffer to continue cleaning.
Note that you can do this with wet Swiffer cloths, as well as your own reusable cloths., Reuse the standard dry Swiffer cloths as long as possible by washing them between uses. Put them in a gentle cycle or wash by hand to keep them clean.


Stick cloths in a mesh laundry bag meant for delicates before you put them in the washing machine. Set your washer to a gentle cycle setting to wash, then hang the cloth to dry before use.Cloths won’t come out perfectly clean from the washer, but they can be effective for several washes. Discard them once they are torn or no longer clean well.
 Purchase refills of dry or wet cloths from a generic store brand rather than Swiffer brand itself. This can save money while being just as effective.


Look in the cleaning supply sections of major chain grocery, discount, and big-box stores. You’ll find the store brand version of many items next to or near the name brand, typically at very reduced prices.
You should also be able to wash and use both sides of generic brand cloths to make them last longer.

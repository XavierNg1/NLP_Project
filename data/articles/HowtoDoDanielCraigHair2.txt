 Once you get out of the shower, very gently run a towel through your hair. Go slowly and be gentle to keep your hair looking smooth. If you want, you can apply a leave-in conditioner just prior to towel drying for added smoothness., It's always best to style your hair when it's completely dry. Towel drying does not usually completely dry your hair. You can use a blow dryer if you're in a hurry to dry your hair further.Air drying is also an option if you're not in a rush.

If you do go the blow drying route, blow dry your hair to one direction and slightly back. Use a small, round brush to direct your hair as you blow dry.This will help emulate the rounded style of Craig's hair. Remember, Craig's hair frames his face by curving around it., Start by applying the clay to the top of your head. Work the matt clay into your hair by moving from your roots to your tips. Push the clay outward from the top of your head as you go, dispersing the clay throughout your hair.Refer to your package's instructions for the precise amount to use. The amount of matt clay you need depends on your clay's specific formula.
 Near one side of your head, give yourself a somewhat messy part. Craig's hair is not known for being perfectly neat, so have some hairs criss-crossing to create a rough, uneven line separating your hair.A comb may create a very neat part, so it's easier to use your fingers to emulate the messy look of Craig's hair.
 Craig's hair creates a rounded shape that frames his face, so your hair should move in opposing directions on either side of the part. However, your hair should not lie completely flat. Use your fingers over a brush to style your hair. As you push your hair to frame your face, tousle your hair slightly using your fingertips. This will cause some hairs to stand up slightly, preventing a flat look. You want a slight spiked effect to give off the Daniel Craig vibe.

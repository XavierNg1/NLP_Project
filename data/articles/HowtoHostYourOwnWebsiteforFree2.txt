You have completed the first step which is to setup a static IP address. Please note: This usually requires a router to do. The reason being, you are just giving your router a static IP.

 Save the files for your site in that folder.


The address for your site will be: yourstaticipaddress/yourfolderinthewwwdirectory/. Except if you signed up for a static DNS service.

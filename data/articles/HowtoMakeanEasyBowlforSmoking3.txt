 For this method, you'll need a large screw or a cigarette, a lighter, a 2-litre plastic bottle, a pen, tape, and a socket wrench socket.
 To use a socket bit piece as a bowl, you'll need to find a socket that has a skinny end small enough that it won't let your product through. The actual dimensions of the socket don't matter as much, as long as the wide end is large enough to pack your product into, and the skinny end is narrow enough to not let it fall through. Try to find one that's around an inch long, with around a 5.6mm diameter for the wide end., The hole should closer to the bottom of the bottle, somewhere around one third of the way up. Make the hole by either burning the bottle with a cigarette, or by heating up the end of a large screw with a lighter. Be careful not to make the hole any bigger than the diameter of the skinny end of the socket.If you're making the hole by heating up a large screw, make sure the screw is the kind with a flat end, and make sure you hold the other end of the screw with pliers or tweezers, so you don't burn yourself.
 Stick the skinny end of the socket into the hole you just made. If the hole is much too small for the socket to fit, you may need to use your lighter to burn the edges of the hole, then work the socket in there. Then prepare a few strips of duct tape. Angle the socket diagonally, pointing upwards, and hold it there with one hand. With the other hand, tape the socket into place. Use as much tape as you need to make the socket secure.
 Make two more holes around the top of the bottle with your cigarette. These will act as the carburetors. Fill your bong up with about four inches of water. Pack your bowl and you're ready to smoke.

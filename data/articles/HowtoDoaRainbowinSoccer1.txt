 If you're right handed, press the ball against your left ankle with your right foot. Raise your right foot and roll the ball up the side of your left leg. Do this quickly and with some force.









If you don't roll the ball up quickly and with force, it will drop back to the ground before you have time to complete the move.;
, Once the ball rolls up to knee level, follow through with your foot so that the ball gets some air as it rolls off of your leg. You want the ball to be positioned just over your heel. So if you used your right foot to roll the ball up your left leg, guide the ball off of your leg once it reaches the knee; it should float down just behind your left heel.
 Now the foot you used to roll the ball should land on the ground. At the same time, use the heel of your other foot to kick the ball upward with your heel. For right-handers, that means your right foot will hit the ground as your left heel kicks the ball, arcing it over your head.









This process must happen very quickly in order to work properly. Practice rolling and kicking over and over until you're able to move your legs fast enough to get it right.
You want to strike the underside of the ball in an upward motion to get it to arc up and over your head. Practice until the ball lands right in front of your body.
Lean forward a bit as you land and kick. This will help the ball move in the right direction.

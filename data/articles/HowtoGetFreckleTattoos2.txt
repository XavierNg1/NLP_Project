 Check to see if the space meets your expectations for cleanliness and proper functioning; for example, does the premises have access to cold and hot water other than the restroom? Also see if the work will be done in a private room away from other contaminates circling in the air.Additionally, see if the technicians are following standard health and safety regulations such as having a clean and neat workspace, using gloves while they work, and using new equipment for each client.
 See how long the company’s technicians have been in the industry and how many procedures they have done. Also ask to see proof of certificates of training, as well as continuing education.Unless they have been in the field for more than a year, a two-day course does not qualify as training.
 Look at the pictures and ask if it is the technician’s own work. Additionally, see if their work matches your personal style; for example, is it too dramatic or not dramatic enough?You can ask for references from clients who have had work done by a specific technician. If the technician is reluctant to give you references, then you should view this as a red flag.

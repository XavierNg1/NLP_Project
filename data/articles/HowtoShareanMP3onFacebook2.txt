 Open a new browser tab, type “SoundCloud” in the address bar at the top, and press Enter to search for it. SoundCloud should be at the top of the results; click it to go to its home page.
 Click the red “Sign up” button at the top right of the page. A small window will pop up giving you three options: Sign up with Facebook, with Google+, or with an email address and password.


Since you want to be able to share mp3 files on Facebook, click “Sign up with Facebook” button. A prompt will appear asking you permission for sharing your activities on SoundCloud to your Timeline. Select “OK” to link your Facebook account with SoundCloud.
 Once after logging in, go to the top right of your SoundCloud homepage, and click the “Upload” button. From the options that appear, select “Choose file to upload.” A file explorer will appear; use it to locate the mp3 file on your computer. Once you’ve located the file, double-click on it.


Soon after selecting the file, a prompt will pop up showing the uploaded content information like Title, Tags, Description, and the upload progress bar. While waiting for the upload to finish, you can always edit the details. When done, click the “Save” button.
 After saving the file, you will be directed to a new page with the link “Go to your track.” Click this and a new page will open where the file is being played. Go down the page, and click the icon of a rectangle with an arrow (this is the Share button).


A pop-up will appear with some sharing options. Select the blue “Facebook” button and another popup will appear with the Facebook Status Update box. It will contain a link to your mp3 file. Write something about the song, if you want, and click the blue “Post” button to share the mp3 file to Facebook.

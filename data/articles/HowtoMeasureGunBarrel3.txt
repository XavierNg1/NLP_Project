 Even if you believe the gun to be unloaded, you should still go through the unloading process to verify that no ammo is inside the shotgun as you measure the barrel.Point the gun in a safe direction and turn it over. Look for a lever that moves up and down at the receiver. This lever is known as an elevator.
Flip the elevator up with your dominant hand while pushing back on the slide with your non-dominant hand. This should eject any round inside the magazine from the bottom of the receiver.
 Slide a dowel rod into the muzzle of the shotgun, pushing it into the barrel until it hits and stops at the breech face.Always use a dowel rod with a diameter that is smaller than the diameter of the gun barrel to prevent accidental damage to the gun barrel. Never force the dowel rod into the barrel.
The point at which the cartridge and chamber meet is referred to as the breech face. The cartridge is not included in the barrel measurement, but the chamber will be.
 Use a pen to mark a line around the circumference of the dowel rod, just above the point where it comes out of the muzzle.


Make the mark as close to the muzzle as possible for the most accurate measurement.
You may need to keep the gun flat on your working surface as you do this.
A pencil or marker could be used instead of a marker.
 Gently slide the dowel rod back out of the barrel. Set the dowel rod flat on your working surface.


Carefully set the gun aside, as well. Make sure that the gun points away from you and from any other living being.
 Grab a measuring stick or tape measure and measure the distance between the mark you created and the end of the dowel rod previously inserted into the gun barrel.


The distance between these two points is the length of your gun barrel.

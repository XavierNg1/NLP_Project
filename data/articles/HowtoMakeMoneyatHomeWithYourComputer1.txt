 Before pursuing from-home employment, evaluate your expertise, work experience, and goals. Ask yourself, “What skills do I have? What kind of work am I willing to do? How much money do I want to make? How much time am I willing to commit?” Be honest with yourself – this information will help you narrow down your options.


Start thinking about your transferable skills.Then update your resume.
If you have a family, make sure that your work-from-home goals align with the family’s priorities.;
, If you have no experience or are looking to start a new career from home, some of the best fields to consider are IT, accounting, and marketing.These are somewhat technical fields, so you’ll need formal training. The good news is that you can earn an affordable associate’s degree in each field at your local community college or through online programs.


If you don’t have the time, money, or motivation to pursue a degree, don’t worry. There are plenty of ways to make money from home.
 Work-from-home scams were the top Internet crime in 2011, and very little has changed since then.If an employment opportunity sounds too good to be true, well, you know the rest.


Legitimate online work opportunities require no initial “investments,” and they certainly do not come in bulk emails.
 To maximize your efficiency, update your computer’s operating system and acquire a high-speed internet service. Find a suitable work space in your home and demand that others treat it with respect – this is your new office!

 All you need to do is tape, glue, or staple the far ends of one paper strip together into a ring. Try to match up the sides evenly. Tape and staples will make for a quick process, but glue will take much longer because it needs to dry.If you are using glue, hold the two ends of paper together until the glue dries. Make sure that the edges of the paper do not slip askew.
You should not need more than one staple or one small square of tape to seal each loop. Make sure that the link is sturdy and will not fall apart.
 Once you have one sturdy ring, thread another strip of paper through the center of the loop. Now, join the ends of this second strip together with tape, staples, etc. The wide, flat edges of the two links should line up, but the loops themselves should sit at a rough 90 degree angle â€“ like a chain!, Continue in the same pattern until your chain is as long as you want it. In theory, there is no limit to the length of paper chain that you can build, as long as you have enough paper, tape, and time. If you want to hang the chain somewhere, measure the length against the space periodically to check if it's long enough yet.
 You can choose to leave the chain long and straight, with a loop at each end, or you can link the ends together with a single strip of paper. To do this: wait until you have an odd number of links in the chain, then loop and seal one final strip of paper through both of the end-links at once. Now, you should have a large ring of paper loops.If you try to seal a chain that already has an even number of links, the orientation of the loops won't match up.

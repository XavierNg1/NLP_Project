 Try to use mango of same species.
 Wash the outside of selected mangoes.
 Use one for putting the pulp of mangoes into, and the other one for the removed skin off the mangoes.
 Place the flesh or pulp of the mangoes into the other bowl. Then press the mango pulp with your clean hand, to separate the juice from the flesh.
 Pour in 1/2 a liter of water to help liquify the pulp. Then use 2 tablespoons of sugar to sweeten it. Stir the mango juice until it tastes sweet (check whether the sugar grains have dissolved).
 Serve the juice in glasses in cool environment. Alternatively, preserve it in a pitcher kept in the refrigerator.

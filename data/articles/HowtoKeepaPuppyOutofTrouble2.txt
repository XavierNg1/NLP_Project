 Puppies explore the world with their mouths, and there are many items that pose choking, poison, or electrical hazards to your puppy. Make sure these items are inaccessible to your puppy at all times. Put them in high cabinets or drawers. Tie up any strings, cords, or wires that you find.Make sure you hide:


String
Electrical wires
Cleaning supplies
Batteries
Small toys and plastic items
Clothing, including as shoes, socks, and underwear
Plastic bags
Plants

, To prevent your puppy from chewing furniture, wires, or other objects, use a taste deterrent. This is a spray that you can apply to your belongings. When the puppy tries to chew or mouth the item, it will leave a bad taste in their mouth.You can buy taste deterrent at most pet stores or at your vet.
Taste deterrents are often found in flavors like bitter apple or bitter cherry.
 If you have a yard or balcony that your puppy uses, make sure that there is no way your puppy can escape. Check the fencing carefully for any holes. Your puppy may attempt to squeeze through even a small patch, so make sure that you repair any breech that you find., The cleaner your home is, the less likely your puppy will find something to chew or swallow. Try to keep your home as neat and tidy as possible. Pick up stray objects and trash from the ground. If you drop food, immediately dispose of it, especially if it is poisonous to dogs.Chocolate, garlic, onions, and grapes are all very dangerous for dogs.Your puppy may choke on food wrappers and plastic left on the ground.

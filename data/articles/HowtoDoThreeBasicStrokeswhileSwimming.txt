 The is the most basic stroke of them all, as well as the fastest. It involves your knees touching, kicking your legs, and raising your arms alternately out of the water, over your head, and back in the water again, in a windmill motion. As you lift one arm up, turn your head in that direction and take a breath, and as soon as your arm touches the water again, turn your face downwards again. Your hands should be 180' degrees (a straight line) from each other at all times.;
, Backstroke is pretty much the same as front stroke, apart from your body is the other way round. Instead of lying on your front, you lie on your back, kicking your legs the same way as you do in freestyle, and you raise your arms, which starts by your side, comes back over your head, and into the water. Once again, your hands should be 180' degrees from each other at all times.
 Breaststroke is a popular stroke for people who like, calm, relaxing swimming. this movement involves your feet staying together, bringing your legs up to your bum, and kicking out to the side, repeating this. Your arms start by your chest, push forward together, and separate and move in a circle motion until they meet back by your chest again. When your feet are by your bum, you start the arm movement. If you keep repeating this sequence, you will get into the swing of it. Some people put their face in the water and come up for air every 2/3 strokes, but some people keep their faces out. It is completely your choice as it doesn't affect the speed of the stroke at all.

 Cut a strip of fabric 25"/64cm wide, across the full 60"/150cm width.


It's a good idea to prewash the fabric before sewing. That way, any possible shrinkage or color run will be dealt with.
If preferred, simply measure out one large rectangle from the fabric, in measurements of your choice. If you're not using stretchy fabric, always measure more generously.;
, Face the right sides toward each other. Match the long edges and pin together.
 Start 3 inches/7.5 cm in from one end and keep a 1/2"/1.2cm seam.
Iron the seam flat, then press the seam open. This will help the stitches to blend into the fabric.
Turn the scarf right side facing out. You'll now have a "tube" of fabric, forming the length of the scarf.
 Align the edges of the short ends neatly together with the right sides. Pin in place; you won't be able to pin all the way, there will be an opening left.
Stitch the short edges together with a 1/2" / 1.2 cm seam. This can require a bit of effort, depending on the fabric used.
As before, iron the ends.
 There will still be a hole left (the opening). Slip stitch the opening closed.
 Try it on, loop it around and keep nice and cozy.

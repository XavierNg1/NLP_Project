 Get refreshed.If you curl your hair or straighten it or whatever you like to do to feel beautiful! You don't want your hair to look oily, and if you do straighten or curl your hair you have to have your hair completely dried and avoid the risk of damaging your curling iron or straightener.;
, It is much easier to do it in the shower, but some people have different opinions. If some of you wash your face two times a day but you still have no results here are two personal tips. If you have acne, a very good cleanser is Cetaphil. It is dermatologist recommended.


Try to keep your hands away from your face as much as possible.. why? Because, your hands have oil and if you keep touching your face, the oil will cause blemishes.
 All models you see on T.V. have perfect pearls, but you don't need those kind of teeth to feel beautiful. Still, a good choice would be apples. Apples not only taste good but they whiten your teeth.
 It takes a while, but blow-drying your hair can really cause damage.
 Do you want to straighten it? Do you want to curl it? Or do you just want to put it up? If you straighten or curl your hair let your device heat up for about 5-10 min.
 Pick a more mature nail polish like a coral, light red, or even clear. French Manicures are also very fashionable. Even if you don't have a kit for it, it can be achieved with white polish, pink polish, tape and patience. But beware: purple, green, and black often looks tacky. If you aren't good at nails ask somebody else to do them.
 Do not put your nails too close to the fan or the polish will dry unevenly and warp.
, Match your clothes so it looks very feminine. Stay away from furry clothes.
 Remember that the less noticeable your make up is the more natural and beautiful you will look.

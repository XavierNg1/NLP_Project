 It is not easy to fix your hair like this without cutting it, so try to buy a wig and chop away. If your hair is originally formed to be styled into a mullet, and it is not blonde, dye it. If you don't want it to be permanently blonde, just get some temporary hair dye that comes off in the shower. And if your hair is already blonde, way to go! That's taken care of!;
, You NEVER see Demyx in normal clothes, unless you find it drawn in fanart. If you are trying to cosplay as a casual Demyx, go right ahead.
 Demyx is very playful, so do whatever you want to make him seem that way. Examples include skipping or singing, or even hugging your friends. An exception would be for a pose. For a serious pose he says 'silence traitor'.
 However if you have green eyes you will have a more realistic eye color for Demyx, though sometimes his eyes are shown blue.

 If your computer came installed with Windows 7 or earlier, use this method to boot from a CD or DVD. Use the method above if your computer came installed with Windows 8.
 The CD or DVD that you insert in your computer will need to be properly configured to boot. This means it needs the correct files to allow your computer to boot from it. Windows and Linux installation discs are bootable, as are many computer utilities such as hard drive diagnostic tools.
 The correct key will be displayed on the computer manufacturer's logo screen when the computer first starts up. Keys vary depending on the manufacturer. Common keys include F1, F2, F11, and Delete.
 If you don't press the key in time, Windows will continue to boot as normal. If you press the correct key in time, the BIOS menu will open.
 Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to open the BOOT menu. Each BIOS will have a different layout, though most should have a BOOT menu or something similar.
 Secure boot will prevent your computer from changing the boot order. This is a security measure, but will keep you from being able to boot from your CD or DVD. Disable it before changing your boot order settings. You can usually find the "Secure Boot" option in the BOOT menu., Use your arrow keys and the to move the CD/DVD drive above your hard drive. Some BIOS menus have you use the + and - keys to change the order. This will make your computer attempt to boot from the CD/DVD drive before it boots from the hard drive.


If you have more than one optical drive installed on your computer, make sure you select the correct drive as the primary boot device.
 This will reboot your computer, and it will attempt to boot from your CD/DVD drive. If your computer boots straight to Windows, then you either did not save your BIOS boot order changes, or the disc is not a bootable disc.

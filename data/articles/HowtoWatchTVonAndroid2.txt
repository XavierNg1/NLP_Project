 Swipe around the interface to find the show you want, or use the search function. Hulu+ is organized by TV or Movies, and Netflix has a variety of genres that you can browse through.
 once you select an episode, it will begin streaming. Hulu+ is ad-supported, so you will likely see an ad or two at the beginning with ads during normal commercial breaks. Netflix functions like a DVD, and there are no ads during playback.


Hulu+ is more likely to have newer episodes, including episodes that aired the night before.

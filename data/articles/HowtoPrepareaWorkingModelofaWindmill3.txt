 Wash the milk jug with soapy water. Rinse it out with clean water several times. Leave it to dry upside down over a towel.
 Once dry, flip the jug over. Measure out 2 cups of gravelâ€”dried beans would work too. Carefully pour the gravel into the milk jug.
 Retrieve your sharp pen or pencil. Place the sharp end of the writing instrument halfway up the side and in the center of the jug. Poke it through 1 side and out the other to create 2 parallel holes., Push 1 end of the straw through the middle of the wine cork. Make sure it is a tight fit! If you straw is made of soft plastic, you may need to carve out a bit of the cork in order to insert the straw.
 Push the end of the straw without the cork through holes in the base. Use a paperclip, or glue, to attach the pinwheel to the end of the straw without the wine cork. Make sure the pinwheel can spin freely without falling off., Cut a length of thread between 24 and 32 inches long. Tie one end around the wine cork. Attach the other end to the second paper clip. Blow on the pinwheel, set it outside, or place it in front of a fan and observe what happens to the paperclip!

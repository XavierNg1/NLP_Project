 Sticks are a nice chew toy. Always use guinea pig safe woods such as apple, crabapple, pear, hazelnut, oak, maple, basswood, linden, and elder. Do not pick up a stick from your natural environment and give it to your guinea pig. The stick must be untreated and not exposed to fungus, bugs, or pesticides.


Unsafe woods include pine, cherry, almond, nectarine, peach, plum, and cedar. These are toxic for your guinea pig.When you purchase wood from a store, be sure that it has not been treated with any chemicals.
 Wooden blocks are another chewing toy option for your guinea pig. Your guinea pig will enjoy them, and you will not have to worry about him choking on them. Childrenâ€™s blocks are a good size.


Be sure the blocks you choose are non-toxic and are not coated with any type of sealant.You can also make your own wooden blocks if you purchase some safe wood from a hardware store.
 Chew toys are a supplement and should never replace hay. When your guinea pig chews hay, the hay is able to reach all of the teeth. Chew toys typically only reach the front incisors.Cheek teeth/molars are the teeth that are most likely to cause malocclusion.Most chew toys do not reach these teeth.

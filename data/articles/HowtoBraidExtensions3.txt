 To prepare your hair for crochet braids, braid your hair into cornrows. You can do 5-6 large cornrows, or you can do smaller ones.


The amount of cornrows you braid into your hair might depend on the kind of extensions you are braiding into your hair. If you are braiding bulky extensions, you can braid less cornrows into your hair.Crochet braids are braids where you first cornrow your hair, then attach the extensions into the cornrows by a latch hook method., If your hair is long enough to extend beyond the nape of your neck, fold them up so they are directly alongside the cornrow. Push a threaded needle through the cornrow and the braided tail, then out and through a loop on the end of the thread. Pull tight to secure the thread around the hair. Repeat a few times along the cornrow.
 Fold the extension in half so the ends meet evenly. The center of the extension should make a little loop. Carefully slide the latch hook under the cornrow. Hook the loop of the extension into the latch hook, then close it.









Buy a latch hook tool. This tool closes the hook so that it doesn't tear, break, or snag on your hair. If you use a regular crochet needle, you might damage your hair.Alternately, you can use a bobby pin. Slide the bobby pin under your cornrow until just the looped end is sticking out on the other side. Slide your extension through the looped end of the bobby pin. Make sure to pull the hair through until both strands are even. Slide the bobby pin and extension under the cornrow.
 Carefully pull the extension underneath the cornrow until the loop of the extension is below the cornrow. Take the strands of the extension and pull them through the loop. Tighten the loop until it is snug against the cornrow, and therefore, attached to your hair.
 Once you have secured one extension, repeat the same process all the way down the cornrow. Place them as closely together as you please, depending on the look you are going for.

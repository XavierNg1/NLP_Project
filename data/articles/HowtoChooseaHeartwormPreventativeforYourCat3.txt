 The regularity with which your cat will be outside can influence the type of heartworm prevention you use. If the cat is primarily a housecat, you probably won’t need a preventative that kills parasitic insects. However, if your cat spends hours outdoors each day, plan to buy a heartworm preventative that kills at least fleas.Especially if you live in the American South—which has the highest number of heartworm incidences—from central Texas through North Carolina, plan to find your cat a heartworm preventative that repels mosquitos and kills other parasites.
 Depending on whether or not your cat is susceptible to other types of parasitic creatures, you may want a heartworm treatment that also kills other parasites. For example, many topical treatments also kill fleas. Other preventatives repel mosquitos, and some treat and prevent ear mites.This may also depend on the type of area in which you live. If you live in a rural location, your cat may be at risk for encountering fleas, ticks, or mites.
If you allow your cat to hunt, or if they are outside often, they should be on a heartworm preventative that also treats and prevents other parasites.
 Depending on the type and brand of heartworm preventative that you choose, it may induce one or more medical side effects on your cat. Be sure to fully read the label before you give your cat the medication. You can let the potential side effects help guide your decision: if any preventatives advertise more serious side effects, avoid giving them to your cat.This is also an appropriate topic to ask your veterinarian about. If you are unsure if a certain heartworm preventative will harm your cat or not, or want to discuss the possible side effects, don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment.

 If you don't have any, you can use wax paper instead. You will be piping the chocolate chips on this.
 Fill small pot with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08) centimeters) of water and set it on the stove. Put a heat-safe, glass bowl on top of the pot. Make sure that the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water.
 If you can't find any cacao butter, you can use coconut butter instead.
 Stir it every so often with a silicone spoon or spatula so that it melts evenly.
 You don't have to add in the raw cashew/macadamia butter, or the dry milk powder, if you are having troubles finding them. These ingredients simply help make the white chocolate chips even creamier., If you don't have one, a plastic, re-sealable freezer bag. Spoon the mixture into the bag, then zip the bag shut tightly. Snip one of the corners at the bottom, and you have a makeshift pastry bag. Don't snip off too much however, or you will get chocolate "kisses" instead of "chips."

, To make the points, gently touch the center of the chips with a toothpick. Lift the toothpick upwards.
 It will take about half an hour for the chips to harden in your freezer.
 When you are ready to use them, simply pull the container out, and take what you need.

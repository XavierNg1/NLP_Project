 The Samurai Sudoku puzzle is a puzzle only to be attempted by a skilled Sudoku solver. It is basically five Sudokus in one. The corners of each are interconnected with a middle puzzle (see image below). These puzzles can be long and difficult.
 When solving these, you must always remember that the corner connected with the center puzzle must work with both puzzles.
 The lines that are twenty-one boxes long are going to be looked at as if there were three separate nine block lines, one of which is comprised of pieces of the other two.
 Just remember that you can have up to three of the same number in lines that connect to the center puzzle.

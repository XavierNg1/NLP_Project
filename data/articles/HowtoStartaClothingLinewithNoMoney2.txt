 Look online or in trade publications for listings of manufacturing companies that could produce a small, initial batch of garments for your clothing line. Get in contact with companies to ask if they are taking on new customers, what their prices are, and if they have production minimums. If you find a company that seems like it will suit your needs, send them any drawings, swatches, or research you have to see if they can make your product.Small batch production typically refers to 500 units or less., Once you have decided on a small batch manufacturer, negotiate the terms of your agreement. Work out a schedule for production and gauge how much time it will take to produce the number of garments you want. Be prepared for a very small profit margin, as small batch production generally costs more than large scale production., Comparison shop for the fabric and other materials necessary for producing your clothing line's first batch. Ask the manufacturer if they provide fabric sourcing, which might yield better rates than finding fabric on your own.As a general guideline for profit, materials should only count for 30 percent of the total cost of making your garments., When you are starting a clothing company, selling online will give you the most flexibility to take pre-orders for items while keeping a limited inventory. Make a website and advertise via social media to avoid typical ad costs and make use of networking. Ask friends and family to share your posts on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

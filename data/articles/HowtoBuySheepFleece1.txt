Consider wool from Australia or New Zealand. Australia is the leader producer of wool in the world, and the country's wool mainly comes from Merino sheep, which have the highest quality wool. The second leading wool producer is New Zealand, which provides crossbred wool from Merino sheep bred with other types of sheep. Australian and New Zealand wool can be purchased online or through woolen mill catalogs.
Consider wool from the United States. The majority of wool in the U.S. comes from Texas, Colorado, California, Wyoming and New Mexico, where most commercial sheep farmers breed Rambouillet (French Merino) sheep. Buy American wool online or through woolen mill catalogs.;

Purchase sheep fleece from a woolen mill or warehouse. A woolen mill provides an extensive selection of sheep fleece in large quantities. The wool at woolen mills and warehouses is typically provided through large-scale sheep farmers.
Buy sheep fleece from wool pools or fiber co-ops. A wool pool or fiber cop-op is a group of fleece producers who combine their wool yields for increased sales potential. Often, sheep farmers don't produce enough fleece to sell directly to a warehouse or woolen mill, so they work with other sheep farmers in their region to market their wool. Wool pools and co-ops typically offer a variety of fleece options sorted by type and classification.
Purchase fleece directly from a local farmer. Small farmers raise sheep for specific markets, such as hand spinning, weaving and knitting. For example, a small farmer may produce only long wools, which are commonly preferred by hand spinners.
Buy sheep fleece from a local carding mill. A carding mill is an establishment that cleans and brushes fleece using machines. Carding mill workers may sell you raw fleece or direct you to local sheep farmers.

 Stop and fill up at the place with the lowest gas price you saw. When traveling long distances, pay attention to the gas prices in various areas so you can have an idea of where to fill up on the way back home.;
, Ask them if they notice a price lower than what you know to be the best price, and visit that location.
 This allows you to get more gas in the tank than if you fill up during the hottest part of the day when the heat expands the gas and causes it to take up more room in the tank. Gas is sold by volume, so you can get more for your money this way.
 Even when prices are on the rise, some companies will reduce the price to make up for the lost money with volume sales.
 There are many websites that list the current gas prices at various stations all over the world.
 This gives you a little freedom as to what price you pay. When you see a good price, top off the tank. When you're on the last few miles or kilometers before the tank is dry, you may have to go to the nearest station regardless of price.

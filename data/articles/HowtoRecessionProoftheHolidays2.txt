 A gift basket can contain food items such as coffee, cheese and crackers, and small bags of candy, or can contain toiletry items such as small bars of soap, lotions, or scented room sprays.


Buy items for gift baskets in bulk. In most cases during the holiday season, you can buy large packages of small items in bulk at a lower cost. For example, purchase a large gift package of small perfume bottles, and place them in gift baskets for your female friends and family.
 Mason jars can usually be purchased for low costs at craft stores, and can be decorated with ribbons or stickers, and filled with any item, including food. For example, fill mason jars with lollipops for your children, or with bath salts for your mother.
 In most cases, certain foods can be frozen and consumed over a period of time. For example, bake your son's favorite chocolate chip cookies, or bake your spouse loaves of their favorite cinnamon bread.
 Fruits and vegetables can be purchased from local farmer's markets at low costs, and is a healthy item that can be given to most friends and family members.
 A large casserole can feed a person for days or weeks, and can be an ideal gift for friends and family who dislike cooking, or lack the time to cook.


Buy disposable or reusable plastic storage containers instead of glass containers in which to place the food. Most glass containers are heavy in weight, and may be more costly than plastic containers.
 A scrapbook can be made by gluing "scraps" such as buttons, ribbons, and other decorative items to the inside of a scrapbook journal, and a digital photo album can be made using one of several types of software, or with a retail store that specializes in digital photography.

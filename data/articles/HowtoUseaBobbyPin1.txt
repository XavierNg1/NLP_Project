 Bobby pins are located in the aisle dedicated to hair accessories, and they are inexpensive.


You can buy higher quality bobby pins, if you choose. Salon professionals advise that they do a better job of holding your hair in place.Try spraying your cheaper bobby pins with hairspray or texturizing your hair before using them. Then, the bobby pins have more ability to grip your hair.;
, Start at your temple, or wherever along your hairline you would like, and slide the comb straight back along your scalp, toward the crown of your head.


A rattail comb works well for this because of its pointed tip.
If you do not have a comb, you can use your index finger; however, the part will likely not be straight.
 This pulls that chunk of hair away from any straggling hairs from the lower area of your hair.
 Here are a couple of tips for doing this:


If you parted the section of hair on the left side of your head, pinch the hair with your left hand. This frees up your right hand to reach across to slide in the bobby pin.
Likewise, if you parted the section of hair on the right side of your head, pinch the hair with your right hand. This way, your arms are not getting crossed and tangled in front of your head.



This method provides a better grip on your hair so that the bobby pin stays in place.
 Insert it at such an angle that the hair will be held in place:


Slide the bobby pin straight up, toward the top of your head, or at a slight angle toward the back of your head. Do not insert it completely horizontally or downward, because your hair will fall out of the pin.
This is a quick and simple method for pinning back your hair. However, it is likely that it will not hold for a long period of time, and you will probably have to reinsert it.
 If these strands should not be secured within the bobby pin, then gently pull them down to clean up the appearance.

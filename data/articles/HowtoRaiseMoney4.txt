 There are now a number of websites devoted to online fundraising. You will want to choose one which is reputable and associated with the kind of project you’d like to do. For example, Kickstarter and Indiegogo are the two most popular platforms for arts projects and creating physical products for sale, where GoFundMe, Fundly, and Crowdrise are for charities and individuals raising money., You will need to have a solid plan for the money you get, carefully laying out exactly how you’ll use it and when you’ll meet deadlines. Share these plans with your backers so that they know you’ve planned ahead.
 In order to encourage people to donate, it is important to have great rewards or incentives, if the platform you are using allows this. Make sure these rewards are something you can provide and that they will not set you back financially. Get as many donated rewards as you can.
 You will want to frequently let people know what’s going on as your donation period progresses. This will keep people interested and engaged, as well as encourage them to share the project with their friends.
 Interact with donors as well as potential donors. This will draw more people into your project, as well as keeping current donors engaged and interested in what you are doing. Message back everyone who sends you questions or feedback, post videos talking about your plans, and go out on to forums which relate to your project to find more interested parties.
 See if local papers or new programs are interested in reporting on your project. Find online blogs that may be interested in what you are doing. Post on forums and take advantage of social media to make sure as many people as possible know about what you are doing and why they’d love to help you out.
 Be extremely gracious with everyone who donates. Let people know how much you appreciate their money. This will make them want to support you more in the future, or maybe even donate more money than they did at first.

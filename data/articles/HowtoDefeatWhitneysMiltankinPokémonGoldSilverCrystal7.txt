 Rage is an attack that increases your attack power when you're hit, as long as it's used consecutively. By the time you reach Whitney, Totodile should have evolved into Croconaw.
 If you get lucky, Clefairy will use Double Slap and hit you 5 times with it, increasing your attack power with each hit. By the time it's KO'd and Miltank comes out, you should hopefully have enough attack power to do a good amount of damage against Miltank. If Rage misses or you use a different attack, though, the attack power will reset, so be sure that you're using it constantly.

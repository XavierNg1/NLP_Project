 Food puzzles--usually constructed of plastic or cardboard--nurture cats’ natural hunting behaviors by challenging them to get food and treats.To get your cat started with food puzzles, it is important for them to have success right away. Begin by using simple, see-through food puzzles, which are more than half full (making it easier to get the food out). You can also sprinkle some cat food (or treats) around the puzzle to encourage an association between the puzzle and food. You may also want to leave these out at night.Purchase food puzzles at pet stores or online, or make them yourself at home.
Food puzzles are available in a variety of styles and levels of difficulty.
 Over time, you will need to increase the difficulty of the puzzles, otherwise your cat may lose interest. Try switching to puzzles with smaller holes or different shapes, or placing puzzles in more obscure areas of your house. If your cat has become a master forager, try making or purchasing difficult two-part puzzles., Instead of simply purchasing cat puzzles, you can make these at home from materials you already have. You will need a plastic or cardboard container that can hold dry food or treats, an X-Acto knife, some food or treats, and maybe some tape.Some options include:

Shoeboxes (make holes big enough for cat’s paws to enter).
Paper towel rolls (seal ends and make holes just large enough to food to fall out).
Plastic water bottles (make holes just large enough to food to fall out).
Egg cartons (no holes are necessary).

 While the oven is heating, take the time time to break the bark up into chunks. Place the chunks in an ungreased pan., Let the bark cook for approximately 15 minutes. Once the time is up, remove the bark from the heat. The bark should look soft but not fully melted (donâ€™t worry--it really is melted).
 Continue to stir until there are no chunks left. Use the melted almond bark for dipping treats into or pouring into a chocolate mold.

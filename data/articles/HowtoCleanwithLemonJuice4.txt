 Either cut a lemon in half and use the half lemon as the scrubber or use straight lemon juice and a soft brush. Combine lemon with the salt and scrub copper (with either the lemon itself or the soft brush). As salt dissipates, add more lemon until completely clean. Buff well with a clean cloth.
 Important to note that you should never clean brass plated items with lemon because the acidity will ruin the finish. Simply combine the lemon juice (or half lemon) with salt and rub on brass surface. Add more lemon to solution until completely clean.

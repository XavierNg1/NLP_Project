 When you begin taking a new dance class, make a point of introducing yourself to the instructor. Not only is this polite, but it sets you apart from other students and creates a rapport with the teacher. Make sure to introduce yourself at a moment that is convenient to the instructor (i.e. not right when they are trying to start the class, or when they are busy with another student)., Being punctual for your dance class will show your instructor that you value their time and respect their classroom. Walking in late may distract the other students from the lesson and disrupt the flow of the class. If you are late, enter the classroom as quietly as possible and wait until an exercise or routine is completed before joining your classmates to participate., Keep up regular attendance to dance classes to show your commitment, enthusiasm, and sense of responsibility. If you need to miss class for any reason, inform your dance instructor as soon as possible and make sure to communicate that this will not be a regular occurrence.Poor attendance will mean poor training, which may affect the entire class by holding back its overall progression.For example, if one student can't master a movement in a ballet class, the teacher will not be able to teach the class to teach the class an enchainement, or combination of movements, involving this step).
 Make a good impression on your dance teacher by dressing appropriately for lessons. Come to class wearing minimal to no jewelry, proper dance shoes (if applicable), and appropriate dancewear for the type of dance class you're taking (e.g. tights and a leotard for a ballet class). Longer hair should usually be tied up or pinned into a bun.

 If you're running and the elephant is drawing nearer, throw a jacket, hat, bag or branch a distance away from you. This might serve as enough of a distraction for the elephant to attack it instead of you.While it's attacking the decoy, run as far from the elephant as you can.
 As outlined in the previous section, being noisy might be all you have left, so stand your ground and roar like a lion.
 It's not an optimal choice and you are extremely exposed if the elephant decides to stomp on you, either deliberately or unwittingly. But if it's all you have left, curl up, protect your head with your arms (or a pack/camera) and play dead. Wait and wait until the elephant tires of you and leaves. Hopefully without stepping on you.
 Attend to any wounds and seek help. Let local park rangers, keepers, police and other relevant parties know what has happened.

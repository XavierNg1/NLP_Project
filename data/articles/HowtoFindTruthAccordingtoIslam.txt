 Islam means submission to the will of the only God and peace. That God is our Creator, who created us out of nothing and deserves our praise. A Muslim is someone who peacefully submits to the will of The One Creator, Who will test us on the Day of Judgment based on our obedience of His Laws (not the ones we create for ourselves). That Creator's proper name is Allah (The One to worship, in Arabic).;
, The Lord sent a prophet to every nation to teach them right from wrong and warn them of the Day of Judgment. Relaying the message of Allah, the prophets gave the glad tidings of eternal Paradise to those who obey, and a stern warning of eternal hellfire to those who reject the truth when delivered to them.
 (According to Shia beliefs) The vast majority of Muslims believe that the religion need no completion after the Qur'an was revealed and instructions left by the prophet.
, Investigate for yourself. This is the most important decision of your life, it's not like choosing what degree to seek, and which house to buy. This life has an end.
 They are:


Allah is the only god, and Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) is his prophet
To pray 5 times a day, everyday, at the correct times.
To fast during the holy month of Ramadan.
To give part of your wealth to charity on a regular basis
To visit the Kaaba in Mecca, if able to do so.

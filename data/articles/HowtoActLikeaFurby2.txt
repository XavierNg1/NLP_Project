 If everything is going well with your family and friends and life is great, be social, kind, and caring! If someone angers you or makes you mad or life is pretty sad for you, be grouchy and veer away from crowds.


Don't hang out with other people much and when someone does talk to you, be gruff. Never be mean, though! If there is music playing, change into an upbeat, dancer girl (or boy).
Be crazy! And go "Uh, huh! Oh, yeah! Let's dance!" Use a lot of slang words, like swag and selfie. Never do that in other personalities except for the following one after this one. Always use older time words in other personalities. If you feel like lots of people are using slang around you, change into a sassy personality. Use a lot of slang. Be sassy, but never mean!

, If you are in the loving one, giggle. If you are in the grouchy one, glare. If you are the dancer girl/boy, go "Ow, dude!" If you are the sassy type, roll your eyes.
 Furbies get hungry frequently. Don't stuff yourself! Never overeat or put yourself at risk for diabetes. Just eat whenever you feel hungry and eat a variety of anything you like! Love desserts and sweet treats! Eat dessert a lot.
 Furbies get tired easily. Take one or two naps during the day and have an earlier bedtime than others. Sleep in as long as you like as long there is no school. If it is as school day, wake up on time!

, Dance to music and have fun! Don't forget to change into a dancer girl/boy when music is on. Listen to any kind of music you like.
 Sing frequently and always hum! Pretend to think no one is listening when you sing.
 If you can, get a Furby and read the instructions. It comes with a guide to speaking Furbish. Memorize all you can and download the Furby app. Look in the Furbish dictionary and learn to speak it fluently. Do not go overboard with Furbish; make sure others can still understand you!

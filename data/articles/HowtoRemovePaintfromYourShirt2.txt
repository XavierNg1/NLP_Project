 This won’t help, and it might just dilute the other cleaning liquids you plan on using.
 This would include distilled turpentine. Alternatively, you can use WD-40, which is a spray that displaces oil and water.Rub the stained area with your first rag. Try to gently scrub out the stain.
Wipe down with the second rag. Examine to see how much of the stain has been removed.
 If the stain isn’t gone, reapply the solvent, and repeat the scrubbing and wiping steps.
 Soak the shirt in the bucket for about an hour. This will help cut both the paint grease and the solvent you used as a cleaner.
 Immediately after soaking, launder the shirt alone in a washing machine.

 In order to understand and effectively evaluate a loyalty program, it’s important to acknowledge what it is you’re evaluating. Ultimately, these programs are marketing initiatives undertaken by companies in the interest of increasing their business.Loyalty program marketing initiatives are designed to accomplish two main goals. First, supermarkets want to retain existing customers. Second, they also want to gain new customers.
By offering rewards and other incentives to people that enroll in the loyalty program, businesses increase the likelihood that people will shop at their stores.
 One of the reasons that loyalty programs are so popular is that they do offer their members considerable benefits. Indeed, member-only benefits can help you save money, particularly on certain items. That said, the savings may not be as significant as they seem - and you may wind up with a lower overall grocery bill elsewhere.On the other hand, some may enjoy receiving marketing material according to their buying habits. For instance, you may receive coupons for particular items, such as dog food, on account of your membership in a loyalty program and your purchasing history.
 Aside from increasing customer loyalty, these programs are also designed to foster feelings of goodwill towards the store. In the same way that your dog falls in love with you the more you train them and give them treats, you develop an affinity for a store that gets to keep telling your how much you’re “saving” with them.Further, many reward programs try to increase your spending by offering points or other incentives to spend more.
While you absolutely can wind up saving on something like gas through your loyalty program, spending more to save more doesn’t always add up to actual savings.

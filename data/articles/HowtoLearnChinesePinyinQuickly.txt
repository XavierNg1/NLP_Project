Spend enough time on practicing until you can memorize and pronounce each sound properly. Trust me, that will save you a lot of time in the long run.
A good method to learn pinyin is by listening to songs and following the lyrics. There is a pinyin song with lyrics that almost every kid in China knows, and it is certainly an easier and quicker way to remember and learn Pinyin.

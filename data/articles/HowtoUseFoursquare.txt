 You will need to have joined first (see Join Foursquare. You will also need to have a phone with internet access (a smart phone) for the application to work. Information on downloading for current smart phones can be found here.


An iPhone application for Foursquare can be downloaded from the App Store.;
, Once downloaded, you can link to your address book, Twitter, and Facebook accounts. This will let you find where your friends are "hanging out" and you'll be able see if they're close by.
 When you check in at one of the many places listed, the GPS location will let your friends know where you are. Don't just visit though, as the idea is for you to leave details about the place, its activities, things worth knowing, etc. to help others make the most of visiting those same places. For example, you can tell your friends which doughnuts are the best, which clothes to try on, or which books to browse. Or you can tell them what to avoid, if needed.
 You can add places and use the application wherever you go, whether you're on the bus, in an art gallery, or at the mall., See what they're enjoying or avoiding around town. And you don't have to limit yourself to their tips alone - you can also see the tips of other users on Foursquare and benefit from their advice also. If you don't know what to do, eat, watch, etc., see what others are recommending.
 Foursquare keeps a record of your recommendation levels and awards you with points and badges. You can keep track of these on the Foursquare website. If you manage to recommend or check into more locations than anyone else, you can become the "mayor" and receive rewards from participating businesses by way of appreciating your loyalty.

 Take time out of your schedule to plan a special date or outing where you and your mother can spend quality time together. This could be a special dinner that you cook at home for just the two of you, incorporating your motherâ€™s favorite dishes, or drinks and tickets to a play that you know your mother would like to see.Choose an outing where you and your mother will have the opportunity to talk and also enjoy an experience together. This will help you to create memorable experiences that you can both share and look back on as part of your bonding experience.
You may also want to treat your mother to a new experience or take her to a location for an outing that she has never been to before. This could be the other side of the city where she lives or to a new restaurant with interesting cuisine she may enjoy. Experiencing something new together can allow you both to bond and share similar emotions and reactions.;
, This is a great option if your mother is often on the go, stressed, or overworked. Surprise her with a day off of work, commitments and responsibilities, and book a joint massage at a spa. You could even make it a full spa day, complete with full body massages, manicures and pedicures. Your mother will likely appreciate your kindness and consideration. A joint spa day will also make it easier for you both to connect and talk, especially if you are both feeling pampered and relaxed.
 Another good bonding tactic is to bring your mother to a place where you both have a fondness for or have shared happy memories of. This could be a nostalgic spot like your old childhood home or a favorite park or beach. Think about a location where you and your mother can bond over a shared memory or a shared feeling.Going to the location together can also give you and your mother topics and subjects to talk about, filling the awkward tension or silence between you. The location can allow you both to remember happier times and bond over moments where you both felt joy.
 Take a hot lunch to your mother's office and surprise her with a nice meal, or invite her over for a surprise dinner, just the two of you. This is a great option if your mother tends to work long hours and rarely receives a surprise just for her.
 This could be to a tropical destination for some sun and sand, back to her childhood home overseas, or a trip to her favorite American city. Planning the vacation together can also act as a bonding experience, as you will both need to communicate about flights, hotels, and daily activities. This will allow you both to spend quality time together and plan for new and exciting memories for both of you.

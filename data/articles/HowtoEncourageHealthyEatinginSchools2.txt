The health coordinator can work with the students on personal habits. This can involve BMI monitoring and evaluating eating habits to help establish healthy goals.
The health coordinator can also have a hand in preparing short lessons in nutrition that will relate to school meals. The lessons can coincide with the lunch or breakfast menu and be taught by teachers or cafeteria staff.
Have the health coordinator evaluate school meals for nutritional content and suggest changes if needed.
 This can be incorporated into existing or new health and physical education programs.


Create nutrition handouts that feature different topics that can relate to a topic students may already be learning about.
For young students, teach colors with fruits and vegetables.
 This can help build parents confidence in the food at school and educate the whole family.
 Letting the students explore where the food is made and see the food being prepared can be rewarding for the food service workers and peak the students interest to try more food at school.
 Also, take a stretch break or physical activity break. The movement and food will boost energy and help the students focus better in class.
 The federal government sponsors the Healthier US School Challenge that establishes health standards for school meals, nutrition education and physical activity. This program offers incentives, resources and assistance to schools that participate. Schools can start their own programs as well.

 This "clears" the lock of any previous numbers. If at any point in putting in your combination you mess up, do this again to start over.;
, Turn the dial to the right and stop at your first number. Always start with a turn to the right!


For your second number, turn the dial to the left, going past zero and your first number. Then stop at your second number.

Some locks are a bit odd or finicky -- if your locker isn't opening after you put the three numbers in correctly, try turning left past your second number once and stopping on it on the next go around.


For your third number, turn the dial to the right and go directly to the last number. Leave your lock on this number. Always remember: right, left, right.
 Pull the lock open and out of the hole, or pull the latch or handle, if there is one. Otherwise, tug on the knob to open the locker.


If your locker just won't open, try it again with the last number being five before or after your "official" last number. Sometimes the older locks get, the shakier they get in their requirements or abilities.

If that doesn't work, ask your classmates or teacher if there are any similar quirks in the school locker system. Try twice before you call a teacher.
 Make sure, if you have a locker with an unattached lock, that you lock your locker when you leave. If you don't, it's possible your things will get stolen or your lock will be turned backwards.


Close your lock up and twist the dial a bit -- if you leave it on the final number, it may open up again effortlessly (for someone other than you).

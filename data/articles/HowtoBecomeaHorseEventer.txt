 When you find one you like, start taking regular weekly lessons with them.
 This will allow you to experience ownership without jumping into it unprepared. After a couple years of lessons and leasing, start shopping for an event horse with your trainer., See "things you'll need" for more details.
 Make sure it can hold at least 2 horses even if you'll only be pulling one, and it has a spacious tack room. Also make sure you have an appropriate vehicle to pull it with.
 See "things you'll need" for details.
 This is an expensive thing to do so, you need to have money and lots of it. The recommended budget at most barns is at least $20,000 a year.
 This will keep you and your horse in shape and ready for shows.
 To tell if you're ready, make sure you're schooling Novice level dressage movements, jumping 2'11", and jumping Novice x c because you always want to school one level above what you show.
 Accidents do happen, so it's better to be prepared. To be safer, always wear an appropriate, good quality helmet (recommended brand is Charles Owen), a skullcap on cross country, and a protective vest and air vest on cross country.
 The cross country phase is especially taxing on mind and body, although the thrill is so worth it! Riding a good 5 or 6 days a week and eating healthy should keep you thin and fit for riding.

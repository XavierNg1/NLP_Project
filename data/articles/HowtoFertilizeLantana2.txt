 Sprinkle 2 pounds of fertilizer over each 100 square feet of garden space and mix it into the top 4 to 6 inches of soil with a dirt shovel or tiller., Sprinkle the fertilizer over the soil around the plant in early spring and mix it into the top 2 inches of soil with a hand rake.


Be careful not to disturb the roots by mixing it in too deep.
 It will burn them. If the fertilizer does get on the plants, wash it off right away with water from the garden hose. Water the lantana right after spreading the fertilizer to help wash it down to the roots.
 In early summer, if the lantana is growing well and blooming profusely, give it another dose of fertilizer but use only 1 pound per 100 square feet.

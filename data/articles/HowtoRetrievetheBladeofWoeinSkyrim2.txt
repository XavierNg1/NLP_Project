 The “Death Incarnate” quest is the second to the last quest in the Dark Brotherhood storyline, right after “To Kill an Empire.” After killing the emperor on the “To Kill an Empire” quest, you’ll be ordered to go back to the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary. The “Death Incarnate” quest will automatically start once you arrive at the sanctuary.


To get to the sanctuary, take the road outside the city of Falkreath (the southernmost city on the map), and after a minute of walking, you should come across a wooden door with a skull carving on it sitting right beside a black pool of water. This is the door of the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary. Approach the door and press the corresponding “Enter” button on your controller as prompted on the game screen to enter it.
 Once you get back to the sanctuary, you’ll find that the place has been stormed and burnt by Imperial troops (result of killing the emperor on the previous quest). Enter the sanctuary through the wooden skull door to and you’ll arrive at the first hall of the place where Astrid can usually be seen loitering around, only this time she’s nowhere near to be found.
 On the left side of the hall (from where you’re standing at the main door) you’ll see another wooden door. Approach the door and press the corresponding “Enter” button on your controller as prompted on the game screen to enter it. This is Astrid’s Safe Room.
 Inside the Safe Room you’ll find Astrid’s corpse burnt by the Imperial soldiers that attacked the sanctuary. Approach Astrid’s body and press the corresponding “Search” button on your controller as displayed on the game screen to open Astrid’s item inventory.


Scroll down the item list and look for the Blade of Woe. Once you find it, press the corresponding “Take” button on your controller as displayed on the game screen to get the weapon. You’ve just retrieved the Blade of Woe and is now yours to use.

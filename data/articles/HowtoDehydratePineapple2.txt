If you plan to dehydrate fruit regularly, or even try making jerky, a dehydrator can make inexpensive snacks all year.
 One pineapple may be enough to fill your dehydrator trays. If you have a large dehydrator, you should opt to buy several pineapples at once to double your quantity of preserved fruit.


You can also dehydrate cans of dried pineapple. They are more likely to contain extra sugar, salt and preservatives, so choose the whole fruit if you want a natural snack.
 Remove the skin and eyes using the process above. Slice it into rounds or into thin chunks.

 Ensure there is some space between the pineapple chunks.
 Remove and store your dried pineapple for several months.

 Wash with soap and warm water. Dry well by patting, not rubbing, the skin. Make sure there is nothing around the cut that might continue to irritate your skin., Spread petroleum jelly (or Vaseline) in the cut with a cotton swab. Do not dip the swab in the jelly more than once, because you could contaminate the jelly., Once the cut is covered with petroleum jelly, cover it with a bandage. If the cut is on your fingers, you can simply roll a finger cot over the cut. Make sure the bandage is on dry skin so that it will stay on — if it’s on the Vaseline it will probably fall off., If the cut is on your hand, the bandage will probably come off after repeated hand washing. On other parts of the body, it’s likely to come off in the shower or bath. When this happens, change it. If it isn’t coming off, coat it with petroleum jelly and change the bandage every morning, monitoring how well your cut is healing.

 To start your pralines, you must first make a caramel. Put your sugar and water into a large saucepan. Stir the sugar and water over a medium heat to help the sugar dissolve. Once it is dissolved, stop stirring the mixture. Use a pastry brush to remove any sugar crystals from the side of the pot.


Removing the crystals makes it so your caramel isn't grainy.
 Increase the heat of the pan. Bring the mixture to a boil. When your mixture starts to get golden brown, add in your almonds and stir the mixture. Once the sugar turns golden brown, remove it from the heat.


Make sure you watch your pot very carefully. The mixture will burn easily.
 Take your pan and plunge the bottom into a sink or bowl full of cold water. This lowers the heat of the pan and keeps the caramel from getting too brown. Cover a flat baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour out your praline mixture and spread it across the pan in an even layer. Let it cool.
 One of the differences between British and American pralines is that they are crushed and used as a topping instead of eaten as candies. Once the pralines have cooled completely, break it apart. Put the pieces into a food processor. Pulse until it makes a fine powder.


These are good as toppings on other desserts such as cakes and ice cream sundaes.

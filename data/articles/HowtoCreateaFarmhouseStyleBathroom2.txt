 The farmhouse style bathroom conforms to minimalist principles of design. Use a limited palette consisting of just a few colors. For instance, you might have light flooring of wood or tile, a green plant or two, and dark wicker furniture. When placing shelves and furniture, line everything up at right angles. Don’t include more lighting, shelving, or storage elements than are necessary., When choosing sink and bathtub colors, choose white. Other bathroom elements like tiles, furniture, or towels should be white, too. White bathroom elements give your farmhouse style bathroom a clean look.If you dislike white, you could choose tile or paint in pastel hues – light blue, gray, or yellow – or a rustic-style wallpaper with simple designs.
 Wooden flooring is the obvious place to incorporate wood into your farmhouse style bathroom. However, you could also choose to frame your mirror with a rustic, unvarnished wood frame. Wooden picture frames and furniture would also look perfect in your farmhouse style bathroom.Choose wooden furniture or wooden flooring, but not both. Contrasting materials will make your farmhouse style bathroom more stylish.
 Antiques are perfect for a farmhouse style bathroom, especially for things that are used minimally or are merely ornamental. For instance, an antique wooden picture frame, towel ring, light fixture, or mirror will give your farmhouse style bathroom that timeworn look that makes the farmhouse style bathroom so attractive.You can get antiques at your local antique shop or flea market, or online.

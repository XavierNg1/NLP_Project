 You can also get some fiberfill to fill your pillow with instead. This project takes a little bit more time than the knotting version, but the results are well-worth it, because you don't get those bulky knots.
 For a more interesting pillow, consider getting a solid color and a matching pattern. For a simpler pillow, consider getting two different solid colors instead. Depending on the size of your pillow, you will need about 1 yard (0.92 meters) of each type of fleece.
 This is very important because you won't be turning the pillow inside-out at the end. It probably won't make too much of a different if you are using only solid colors, but it may make a different if you are using patterned fleece; sometimes, the pattern may only be on one side.
 Use a ruler and a pair of fabric scissors (or a rotary cutter) to ensure that your lines are straight. Also, try to cut though both layers at the same time. This will ensure that both pieces of fleece match up.
 If you need to, draw the squares first using a ruler and a piece of chalk. Be sure to cut through both layers of fleece so that everything matches up.
 Make sure that you cut through both pieces of fleece. This way, you can be certain that the tassels will match up.
 The slit needs to be centered, and it needs to be at the base of the tassel, where the fringe joins the pillow., Starting at the bottom left corner, take the top and bottom tassels. Keeping them together, push them through the 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) slit, and give them a gentle tug., If you are going to use fiberfill to stuff your pillow with, complete most of the fourth side, leaving only four tassels undone.
 Simply tuck your pillow form into the fleece, or stuff it with fiberfill, then weave the opening shut. If you see any chalk on your tassels from before, gently brush it off.

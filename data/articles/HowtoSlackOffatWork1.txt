 Before you embark on your trip to the bakery down the street or the bathroom on the opposite end of the building, you must disconnect yourself from whatever sense of productivity you previously had.;
, Maybe you are hungry and feel like taking a second lunch at a restaurant within walking distance of your office. Maybe there are places in your office that you haven't yet explored. Maybe you just feel like wandering for a while, and letting your now empty mind take you where it will. Whatever you do, it is important that you keep the end goal in mind: wasting as much time as possible.
 This is the most exciting part! Now that you have shut your computer and chosen your destination (or not), you are ready to depart on the enlightening journey that is freedom. Enjoy your freedom!

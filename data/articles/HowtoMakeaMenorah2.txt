 Parents and synagogues often teach young kids to make their own menorah this way. All you need is nine or ten metal hex nuts, nine candles that fit inside the nuts, a long slab of wood, and strong glue. You can find all of these at a hardware store.


Pick up any decorations you'd like to use as well. See below for some suggestions.
If you can't find nuts that will hold up your candles, you can glue tea candles directly onto the wood instead.
 Place all eight nuts first to make sure they are evenly spaced, in a straight row, and that there's room left for the ninth nut. Glue each nut onto the wood and wait for it to dry.


Weighing down the nuts with heavy objects will help the glue bond.
 The ninth nut will hold the shamash, or helper candle. This candle is the one that will light all the rest, so it has to stand out from the rest. If you have ten nuts, you can stack two on top of each other so the shamash is higher. Otherwise, just glue the ninth nut anywhere that's not in the same line as the other eight.
 Make the menorah your own with mini decorative tiles, paint, glitter glue, or your favorite kind of decoration.

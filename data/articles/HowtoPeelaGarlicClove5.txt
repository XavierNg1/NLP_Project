 Pull the cloves you want to peel off the head and place them on a cutting board.
 The cloth will control the garlic from flying off the table as you hit it. Any kitchen towel will do.
 This will crack the shell, allowing for better peeling. This is similar to using the knife blade, but it is easier to do on many pieces of garlic at once.









You don't want to smash the cloves, simply hit them lightly but firmly to get the skins off.
 Lift the cloth and pull away the remaining skins. You may need to cut some of the ends off to fully remove them.

 Smoking may delay the healing process, so it is a good idea to quit smoking while you are recovering from thyroid surgery.Ask your doctor about smoking cessation programs in your area as well as other resources that may help you to quit smoking.
 Good nutrition and adequate hydration are important ways to support your body’s healing process. You may need to follow a special liquid or soft foods diet after your surgery and then stick to your doctor’s recommendations thereafter.A liquid diet includes juices, broth, water, decaffeinated tea, and ice.
A soft foods diet includes items such as pudding, jello, mashed potatoes, applesauce, room temperature soups or broths, and yogurt.
You should be able to move to solid foods as tolerated after a few days. As you recover from surgery, you will have some pain when you swallow, so it is a good idea to take pain medications about 30 minutes prior to your meals., Use a high SPF sunscreen, such as SPF 30, or keep your scar covered a scarf for an entire year. Using these measures to protect your scar from the sun will provide the best cosmetic outcome for your neck wound.Make sure that your wound is fully healed before applying sunscreen on it. This should take about two to three weeks.

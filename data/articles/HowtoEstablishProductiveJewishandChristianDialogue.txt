 A racist or preachy attitude is useless for interfaith dialogues.;
, Ask a practitionerÂ  of Judaism and Christianity for books that they feel give an accurate view of their own religions.
 No matter how big your group is, you will not be able to fully represent either religion in your dialogue, because there is just too much variety.
 Remember, a dialogue is not a debate.
 If things wander from history to philosophy and then over to culture, it may be harder to ensure things stay civil.
 Stop the dialogue if things get heated, before they get out of hand.
 No one is directly responsible for things their ancestors or cousins did.
 Your goal should be to learn and teach, not to convert people from either faith, prove someone wrong, or rehash wars from thousands of years ago.

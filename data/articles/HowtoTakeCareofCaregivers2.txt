 Depending on your loved one's disability or condition, they may qualify for respite care programs. This allows the person to spend some time with a new and interesting carer, while the primary caregiver(s) can take some time off and recharge.

Adult day care exists for senior citizens.
 This can help the caregiver from feeling isolated. Try going out for coffee, inviting them over for dinner, or even coming over to hang out.


Listen to them and validate their feelings.
 Caregiving is a job (whether they're getting paid for it or not), and everyone needs time to relax.

 Completing Operations in CoD Ghosts is a good way of gaining fast XP in no time. Some Operations are so easy to complete such as running 5 miles (8.0 km) while in marathon. How hard can that be?


Make sure you have the right weapon or perk to complete your current available Operations.
Switch around weapons early in the game for you to gain weapon related XP from Operations. The lower the level of the weapon, the easier it is to complete its startup Operations.
 Field Orders are available on almost all of the online modes. Most players seem to ignore these blue suitcases but they don’t realize that completing these Field Orders rewards players a handsome amount of XP.
 Sometimes COD Ghosts announce double XP weekends and that’s when online matches really go haywire! Imagine playing Cranked (which gives you double XP by default) during double XP weekend.

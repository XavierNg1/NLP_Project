 Swipe down from the top of the screen to get the notification panel. Afterwards, tap the Settings icon at the upper right.
 Tap on the Controls tab then tap on “Motions and Gestures.”

, Tap the “Air Browse” button, and tap the slider to “On” to enable this feature.
 Tick the boxes opposite a list of app categories to enable Air browse on these apps.


To use Air browse, simply move your hand over the phone to scroll through the images, emails, web pages, music and more with which you have enabled the feature.
 These features are similar to the previous couple of Galaxy phone iterations: Direct Call, Smart Alert, and Mute/Pause.
 Do so by tapping the slider to “On” on Air View in the Motions and Gestures menu. This will extend text or enlarge pictures by holding your finger over the device and moving it up or down.


You can enable the feature on the Samsung Calendar, Gallery, Video Player, and Phone apps.

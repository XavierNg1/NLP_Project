 To make this sandwich, you'll need:


1 egg
3 cups milk
3 cups fine breadcrumbs
1 cup flour
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. paprika
4 tsp. black pepper
2-4 tablespoons cups cooking oil
2-4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1-2 tsp. of red chili powder for a spicy flavor, if desired
1 tsp. of crushed onions

, Put the egg and milk into a single bowl. Beat the egg until it's integrated. Then add the breadcrumbs, flour, and additional dry ingredients, stirring thoroughly with a whisk to integrate the batter mixture.
 Evenly dip each chicken slice into the flour, and then the batter, and the flour again. Put the pieces on a plate to let them rest while you prepare the frying oil.
 Put the stove at medium setting, and flick a small amount of cold water at the oil to check the heat. If it hisses, then the pan is hot enough to cook the chicken.
 Put a few pieces in at once, but be careful not to crowd the pan. If you do, you'll bring the temperature of the oil down significantly, making your chicken soggy and greasy. Turn the chicken once, when it becomes golden brown on the bottom.


Remove chicken from the pan when it's golden brown and has cooked to an internal temperature of 165Â°F. Place the chicken slices on a cutting board to let them rest before slicing.
If you don't have a thermometer, slice a piece of chicken in half. Make sure the juice runs clear and there's no pinkness on the inside.
 Fried chicken goes great on any number of different kinds of sandwich bread, and with a variety of different condiments and additions. Try out the following:


Use Italian bread, tiger bread, baguette, or olive-cheese bread.
Top with slice dill pickle, raw red onion, lettuce, and tomato.
Add mayo, mustard, or ketchup to taste.

 Crush enough tortilla chips to fill 2 cups (126 grams) and place them in the bottom of an 8-inch (20.32-centimeter), lightly greased casserole dish. How many chips you end up using depends on how big they are. For example, you'll need more tortilla strips than the regular, triangular type.

You can grease the casserole dish with cooking spray, oil, or butter.;
, Lightly oil a 12-inch (30.48-centimeter) skillet, and let it get hot over medium-high heat. Add the beef, and cook it until it is lightly browned. Drain any excess fat., Mix the taco seasoning into the beef, then let it cook for about 5 to 7 minutes. It is ready when the beef is completely cooked through., Since the beans are already cooked, you simply need to heat them long enough until they are hot. This should only take about 5 minutes.

Save time by doing this while the beef is cooking.
 Keep stirring the beans, salsa, and cheese until everything is evenly combined. Save the rest of the cheese for later., If you have not already, crush the tortilla chips, and spread them across the bottom of the casserole dish. Spread the beans on top, then the beef. Finish off with the rest of the cheese., If you don't like those two things, you can leave them out as well. You can also try other toppings, such as diced onions or bell peppers instead., It is ready when the cheese melts and the mixture inside is bubbly. You do not need to cover the casserole while it is baking., You can also add some chopped up lettuce or crushed tortilla chips.Let the casserole cool for about 1 to 2 minutes before digging in.

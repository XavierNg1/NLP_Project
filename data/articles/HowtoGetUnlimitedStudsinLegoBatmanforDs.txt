 You can gain access to this part of the Batcave by completing Chapter 1 (The Bullion Dollar Riddle), Level 1 (Ice Cream Factory).;
, Just go to the door to the right of Chapter 3.
 You will find these stairs about 2 feet (0.6Â m) from the entrance you just came in.
 Look for Clayface. He might be behind one of the doors, or walking around. Each time it changes.
 Pull each lever and destroy everything in each room until you find bricks to build.
 Once you have discovered the bricks to build, build the button and step on it. A barrel will roll out of the wall and explode. Build two handles from this.
 With Clayface, hold A and press down on the D-Pad. The wall will crumble, and you may enter.
 Blow up the computer to the left, then build a lever out of it.
 Pull the lever, then step on the 4 panels in the middle of the room.
 The wall will shoot out boxes that will explode into BLUE studs!! Get them quick before they disappear!

, Leave the room and return to the Batcomputer. Wait a few minutes, and REPEAT for your desired amount of studs!!

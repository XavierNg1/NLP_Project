 Place your cat’s paw under cool, low-pressure water. The water will clear away dirt and debris so you can inspect the severity of the cut. If the cut is deep or contains foreign objects that cannot be removed with tweezers, then you will need to take your cat to the vet., Wrap your cat’s paw with gauze or a clean cloth. Apply gentle, but firm pressure to control the bleeding. Have someone drive you to the vet’s office. While on the way to the vet, hold the gauze in place until you reach the vet’s office.If you do not have someone to drive you to the vet, then secure the gauze with medical tape.
 Once you get to the vet’s office, the vet will sedate your cat. The sedation will enable your vet to remove any foreign objects that are deeply lodged in your cat’s footpad., Your vet will flush the wound to remove dirt and debris. Then they will clean the wound with either chlorhexidine or povidone iodine., Your vet will most likely apply a temporary bandage. Change the bandage according to your vet’s instructions. You may need to change the bandage daily or every two days, depending on the severity of the cut.Additionally, make sure to clean the wound according to your vet’s instructions.
If you notice any signs of an infection while you are changing the bandage, such as swelling, oozing pus, and/or a foul smelling odor, then take your cat to the vet immediately.

 If your dog is having short-term incontinence issues, getting a pack of disposable diapers is probably the best solution. If your dog will be dealing with incontinence in the long-term, washable diapers will be the most environmentally friendly and cost-effective solution.In spite of the cost implications, you may want to use disposable diapers because they’re more convenient. Washable diapers, after all, must be washed regularly.
The other pros of washable diapers include better fit and less noise from rustling plastic when your dog is moving around.
 If your dog leaks a lot, you may have to add disposable or washable incontinence pads to your dog’s washable diaper to absorb the moisture. If your dog is defecating in their diaper, it’s essential to use a disposable liner for the sake of easy and hygienic cleaning.
 If you have a male dog that only has difficulty with dribbling urine, you could use a belly-band in lieu of a diaper. Belly bands are machine-washable wraps that provide leak protection while protecting your dog’s skin.Belly bands tend to be less obstructive than diapers for your dog and less hassle for you since they generally velcro on and off.
 Diapers generally come in five sizes, from extra-small to extra-large, that have different associated weights and waist sizes.Check the sizing chart for each brand to ensure you get the right size. In general, the breakdowns for weights and waist sizes are as follows: extra-small - 4-8 lbs / 10-13”, small - 8-15 lbs / 13-19”, medium - 15-35 lbs / 18-25”, large - 35-55 lbs / 20-27”, extra-large - 55-90 lbs / 25-34”.
Male dogs sometimes need a size up to accommodate their genitalia.
To ensure the sizing is right, you’ll have to test the diapers on your dog. It should be snug enough to prevent leakage but comfortable enough that it does not cause chaffing, especially around the elastic openings.

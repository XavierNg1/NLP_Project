 Save money by reducing the number of cleaning products you use overall. Instead of purchasing separate kitchen and bathroom counter cleaners, by a single multi-purpose cleaner that is good for use in multiple rooms and on multiple surfaces.Keep in mind that products with bleach or lye in them should not be used near foods or food surfaces, or near areas where pets eat or where houseplants are kept.
 The manufacturer will encourage you to use a greater amount of product so that you run out faster and need to purchase new product more frequently. However, many cleaning products are still effective if you use about half the manufacturerâ€™s recommended amount.Read the packaging to figure out how much product the manufacturer recommends for the size and type of surface you want to clean. From there, you can figure out how much product you really need.
 You will need less product in the long run if you use a little bit on a regular basis. Consistently clean your home before things get dirty or messy to avoid using extra product on multiple scrubbings, pre-soaking, or special treatments.Create a cleaning calendar that helps you rotate out a few cleaning areas every day of the week. For example, you may choose to scrub the bathroom every Monday, the Kitchen every Wednesday, and vacuum the carpets every Sunday.
Dedicate 20 to 30 minutes each day for household cleaning. Set a consistent time each day such as right after you wake up or an hour before bed to be your cleaning time.

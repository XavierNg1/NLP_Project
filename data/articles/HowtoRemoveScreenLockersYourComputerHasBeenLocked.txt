 Empty anything you want to keep from it onto that computer.;
, On the uninfected computer, download 'HitmanPro' from its website. You won't need to pay. Once the installer is downloaded, double click it.
 The window should say something about 'kickstart' and tells you that it found the USB key you inserted; there will be an option to turn the USB key into a 'kickstarter' device, which requires formatting the USB key, so do that.
 Once the USB key is turned into a 'kickstarter', plug it into the bad computer.
 If it's already on when you plugged the USB in, then restart. Do the following very quickly:


As soon as anything appear on the screen, look for a certain button that lead you to the setup menu (the button is probably F8, F9, or Esc, it varies from computer to computer)
Gently and repeatedly press that button (if you missed it start again)
Once you get into the setup menu, look for 'boost option' or 'device option'
When you find that, select the USB key as the boosting device.
 Your computer shouldÂ then run normally, so go into an account. The screen locker shows up, brandishing its nonsense. A moment later, a window shows up on top of the screen locker, something about 'HitmanPro'.
 If it asks you to buy it, choose 'Free 30 day installation'. Usually the program will find the virus. Let it delete the virus and press restart.
 Hopefully by now, your computer will be operational again.

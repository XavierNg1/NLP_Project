 One way to sketch is to draw basic shapes, such as circles and triangles. Then, connect the shapes as you see fit.


Sketch a circle where you want the light source to be. You don't have to keep it in the final drawing, but it will make it easier to determine where shadows would be. Consider sketching a few light lines where the shadows will be, so you won't have to think about it later on.;
, The pressure you put on the pencil depends on the style you're going for. For realism, don't make the lineart dark; keep it in the midtones, so you can blend it with the shadows. For a cartoon style, make the lineart dark and possibly thicker, to create a defined edge.
 Be careful not to erase your lineart. Erase carefully, and take your time.

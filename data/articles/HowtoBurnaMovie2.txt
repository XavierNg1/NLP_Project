 This is a free, open-source burning program that is the best way to create a video DVD on a Mac now that iDVD is no longer being distributed. You can download Burn for free from burn-osx.sourceforge.net/Pages/English/home.html.
 You will be greeted by a sparse window.
 Give your DVD a title, and select "DVD" from the pop-up menu.
 You can also click the "+" button and browse for movie files on your computer.
 If the file is not an .mpg file, Burn will automatically convert it for you. This may take a little while, depending on how large the file is and the speed of your computer. Make sure "NTSC" is selected from the pop-up menu in the conversion window if you are in the US; if you are in Europe, select "PAL".


DRM-protected QuickTime files may not work.
If the file will not convert, you may need to convert the file using a program like Handbrake, which is designed specifically for converting video files.
 This will create a basic menu for your video files.
 This is the best format for burning DVD videos. DVD-RW discs allow you to reburn, but they don't work in all DVD players.


If OS X opens a window asking what you'd like to do with the blank DVD, click Ignore.
 This will begin burning the video files to your DVD. You won't be able to create any fancy menus, but your DVD will be playable in virtually any DVD player.

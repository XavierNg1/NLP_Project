 Move furniture out of the way, if you must. If you can take over a bed or table for sorting, do so.;
, This includes bed and bath linens, dishtowels, slip covers, etc.
 Start with underwear, socks, and work clothes as top-priority items. Then come favorite items that you wear frequently. If you don't have clean linens for bed and bath to replace the dirty ones, go ahead and prioritize them too.



Don't forget to come back to these piles. Mend an item if it's a favorite. Get rid of it if it doesn't fit or flatter. If you have a lot of things in this category, chances are that they're just getting in your way, jamming up your drawers and closets, making it harder to put away and find what you do wear. Throw away underwear and socks if they have holes or hopeless stains.
 You may need to prioritize the "priority bags," depending on how many piles you have.
 The sooner you start, the sooner you'll finish. The laundry task isn't finished until you've put away the clean clothes. If something doesn't fit or doesn't make you feel great to wear it, then don't bring it back in the home. Or even try a yard sale!

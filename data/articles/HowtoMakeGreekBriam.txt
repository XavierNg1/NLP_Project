 Fry the onions over medium heat until tender and golden (about 10 minutes).;
, Add remaining vegetables and herbs and stir to coat them with the oil and wine.


Alternatively, you may remove the onions and garlic once fried, and layer the vegetables with the potato at the bottom in layers much like a lasagne. Mix the tomatoes, onions and herbs together as a sauce and add that as layers in between the other vegetables.
 If you made the first mixed method (instead of layering), stir occasionally to ensure the sauce develops and that it cooks evenly. Add a little more water or wine if it seems dry and stir to coat. If you followed the layered method, pour a little water or wine on the top.


Be conservative with adding extra fluid. The sauce should be absorbed into the vegetables so there is not so much as a gravy or sauce but that the vegetables remain distinct. If you can get away with adding no extra liquid the dish will be more intense in flavour.
 You may also garnish with more chopped herbs and lemon wedges if desired.

 Blankets are not recommended for infants as they are a suffocation hazard and are believed to be a risk factor for developing SIDS. Additionally, your baby could roll over during the night and get out from underneath their warm blanket, leaving their bodies exposed to the cool air. If you dress him in warm clothing with a couple of layers, you can take a layer off to adjust to the changing temperature if the baby becomes too hot.
 This is a serious suffocation hazard and can also cause him to overheat very quickly. Certain hats or bonnets can cause your baby to choke so it is best to avoid all head coverings when placing the infant down to sleep.
 If the sleeping bag is the correct size, it can help protect your baby from SIDS by keeping his head and face uncovered. The sleeping bag can also keep your baby from rolling over and ending up on his stomach while he is sleeping. Be sure to dress your baby appropriately for sleeping in the sleeping bag. You may not need as many layers of clothing because the sleeping bag will keep the warmth in., Wraps are designed to swaddle your infant in the same way you would swaddle him with a blanket, keeping his arms held tightly against his body. These specially designed wraps provide the same comfort as a swaddling blanket without the dangers associated with blanket use at bedtime. Using a wrap can help get your baby settled for bedtime and can also make sure he is safely sleeping on his back. As long as you keep the wrap away from his head, it can make your baby feel very comfortable while keeping him very warm.

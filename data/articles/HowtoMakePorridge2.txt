 This recipe can also be made with uncooked rice, though it takes much longer. Just make sure there’s enough room in the pot for plenty of water, too.


You can also make this dish with a rice cooker or in the microwave. With those, times may vary. Essentially, congee is just cooked rice with much more water, allowed to stew.
 As most rice porridge is used to get rid of leftover rice, measurements are not a standard of this timeless recipe. However, with cooked rice, you want about twice as much water – enough to cover the rice and then about an inch more.


If the rice is uncooked, you’ll need about 4 times as much water. The rice expands and absorbs the water while cooking.
Broth is good if you're looking for a richer, more savory taste, but it's hardly necessary.
 Keep stirring to nudge the grains apart and to give it a smooth consistency from the get-go. Once it reaches a boil, bring the heat down to low and let simmer.


Cover your pot, resisting the urge to check it more than once or twice. The more you open it, the more the steam and heat escapes, slowing the process.
 Be sure to break up the eggs with a fork or you might end up with bits of yolk floating around in your porridge. In traditional rice porridge, the eggs are blended right into the porridge, giving it flavor instead of texture.


Congee, or rice porridge, isn't about rice porridge with bits of scrambled egg floating about. To be sure it'll turn out smooth, whisk up the eggs beforehand and then add to your porridge.
 As the broth or water breaks down the rice, slowly it will start to congeal and become one mass. The grains will smooth out and the water will seem the thicken. If you see this, you're on the right track!


Be sure to keep stirring – it's best that it's all cooked evenly and nothing is left to harden on the bottom of the pan.
 Soy sauce is a very common addition to congee, and some people like to add a little kick with chili sauce or Sriracha.

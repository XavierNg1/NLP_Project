 If you wake up, unless you have to use the bathroom, don't look at the clock or even open your eyes. Sleeping is an ideal way to pass time.


Pretend that you have to wake up when your parents wake up, so you want to fall asleep and sleep in. If you are up hours, or even just an hour before you are allowed to wake up your parents/open presents it will feel like a lot longer as you are waiting in suspense, so keep yourself (quietly) occupied.
If you wake up and can't get back to sleep then do a quiet activity that doesn't involve electronics (ie reading, writing, tidying your room).
 Open it very slowly. Now, you have more new entertainment.


If you have to wait until everybody's up to do stockings then follow the suggestions in the previous step to keep yourself occupied. By now other excited siblings (if you have siblings) are probably starting to wake up as well. Tell them that you can't wake your parents up yet and suggest things to do such as: make the family breakfast (if you are allowed to use the toaster, jug etc), play a board game, play video games together (quietly!)

, Not just microwave pancakes, go big. French toast, eggs, homemade pancakes/waffles, etc. Then, savor each bite like it's your last.
 Siblings are a great way to entertain if you can't leave. You can tell each other stories and play games and do endless things. You could also use electronics. Watch TV, browse the web, etc. You could also read or do homework. Find entertainment in the things you've got. Cleaning might be your best bet because you need room for your gifts.
 The steps above are also available. Watch something in the living room. Look around at the gifts. Observe the tree.


If parents/guests/pets/siblings are sleeping refrain from things such as TV, talking on the phone and anything noisy as you may wake sleeping people.

 When you’re ready to take off your nail polish, stuff the empty pill bottle with cotton balls. Sprinkle some nail polish remover over the cotton balls. Dip your finger in the in the bottle and twist. Repeat for each digit you wish to remove nail polish from., Take a bunch of crayons of a single color and strip them of their paper covers. Drop them in an empty tin can. Place the can in the oven on low heat. Check the oven intermittently. After about 10 minutes, the crayons should be melted into a colorful goo. Pour the melted crayons into an empty pill container.After two to three hours, the crayon should be cool. You could try to ease it out of the pill container, but you’ll probably have to crack it open with a hammer.
For extra fun, melt crayons of many colors, then add different colors to your empty pill bottle in successive layers. Then you will have a multicolor crayon that changes color as you use it.
 Glue a small tealight candle to the top of the empty pill bottle. You could also turn the empty pill bottle upside down and use the wider top as a more stable base, then glue the tealight candle to the bottom of the empty pill bottle instead.You could glue two or three empty pill bottles together to make a taller candle holder.
To give your candle holder a pleasing appearance, dip it in a glossy paint. You could remove the cap before doing so and paint it a different color.
 Turn your empty pill bottle to its original purpose – with a twist. On your anniversary or Valentine’s day, fill the pill bottle with red chocolate-covered candies or candy hearts. Use your home printer to create a professional-looking medication label with your name, followed by “M.D.” Write a clever prescription on the label, like “Take twice daily. For best results give your partner a kiss just before and just after use.” Give it to your partner.

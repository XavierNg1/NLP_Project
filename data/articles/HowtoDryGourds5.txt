 Submerge the gourds in a bucket of warm, soapy water. This helps to loosen the skin and mold that may have developed on the outer surface.


You can add bleach to the water to give the gourds a uniform color but this is not necessary.
 During the drying process, the outer skin may become wrinkled or stained. In general, you will want to scrape it off.You can also use steel wool or sandpaper to remove the outer layer of skin. However, using either of these tools will result in scratch marks. Only use sandpaper or steel wool if you plan on painting the gourd.
 While this is not necessary, it will give the surface of your gourd a uniform texture. You can also sand the inside of the gourd so that it is smooth.

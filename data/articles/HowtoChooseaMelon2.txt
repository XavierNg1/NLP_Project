 While a watermelon should be a bright green color, its skin shouldn’t be shiny. Instead, look for one with skin that’s slightly dull. It should also have a uniform shape to indicate that it’s matured fully.If a watermelon’s skin is shiny, it may indicate that the melon isn’t ripe.
 Next, pick the watermelon up and examine the bottom. There should be a creamy yellow spot from where the melon rested on the ground as it was growing. This field spot indicates that the watermelon spent plenty of time in the sun maturing instead of being harvested too early.The deeper the color of a watermelon’s field spot is the sweeter the melon will be. A white spot is fine, but a yellow spot is best.
 As you’re holding the watermelon, run your fingers along its skin to examine the texture. There shouldn’t be any dents, bumps, or irregular curves, which can indicate that the melon didn’t get regular sun and water as it grew. Instead, choose a smooth, even melon.Make sure that there aren’t any cuts or scars in the watermelon’s skin either.
 With the watermelon in your hands, make sure that it has a good weight. It should feel heavy for its size, so compare it with another melon that’s a similar size to see if it has a good heft to it., Finally, hold the watermelon a couple of inches from your ear and knock on it with your knuckles. If the melon is ripe, it should make a hollow, tenor-like sound.The knocking test shouldn’t be used as the only test for ripeness because not all watermelon farmers agree that it is accurate. Overripe watermelons can sometimes make the same sound as ripe fruit. Use it to confirm that a melon that meets all of the other criteria is ready to bring home.If the watermelon makes a thudding sound when you hit it, it is likely still full of water and not yet ripe.

 In general, banks charge the highest fees for money orders. Every bank charges a different amount. Some banks may charge you as low as $1.25 for money orders up to $1,000. Others may charge you as much as $5.00. If your bank charges more than $1.25 for money orders, try to go someplace else to purchase one., The post office charges $1.25 for money orders up to $500 and $1.65 for money orders up to $1,000. This is not the least expensive fee for money orders. However, people will be less likely to question the legitimacy of a money order from the U.S. Post Office. It is a widely-recognized, well-respected issuer of money orders. Also, if you need to pay with travelerâ€™s checks, the post office is the only place where you can do that. Finally, it is convenient if you need to send the money order to someone, because you can purchase the money order and mail it all in one transaction., Remittance service providers are places where you can electronically transfer money. Examples include Western Union, MoneyGram and Walmart. Walmart charges 70 cents for money orders up to $1,000. At Western Union and MoneyGram, the fees for money orders vary from branch to branch.

On top of that, you will have to pay a fee of 5.49 percent of the value of the money order. Finally, you have to pay for postage to send the money order to the recipient. If you want to send it via express mail, expect to pay approximately $15., Money orders are generally capped at $1,000. So if you need more money than that, you must purchase multiple money orders.

This adds up to $4.55.

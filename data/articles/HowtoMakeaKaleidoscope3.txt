 Cut a piece of acrylic mirror into three 7 7⁄8 inch (20.0 cm) by 1 1⁄8 inch (2.9 cm) rectangles, using an operating table saw with a carbide-tip blade. Use a vacuum to clean any sawdust from the mirrors.
 Cut a white PVC pipe with a diameter of 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) to a length of 7 7⁄8 inches (20.0 cm) using a chop saw with a carbide tip-wood blade. Clean the tube to remove any dirt or debris.
 Drill a 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) hole into the center of a 1 1⁄2 inch (3.8 cm) PVC socket end cap. Wipe around the hole to remove any debris.
 Cut a strip of adhesive-backed foam into pieces about one inch long. You will need three pieces for the kaleidoscope.
 Get a piece of foam rope that's half an inch in diameter. Cut it into one inch pieces. You will need three of these for the kaleidoscope.
 The petri dish should be 60 mm by 15 mm and should be made out of plastic. Use PVC cement to attach the petri dish to the tube, being careful not to get any cement on the dish.








You can either leave the glass clear to create a "world view" kaleidoscope or you can create a colored kaleidoscope by drawing on the inside face of the petri dish using colored permanent markers before you attach it the the PVC tube., Gather the three mirrors, long sides together and gently fold them into a triangle with the shiny sides facing in. Make sure you have removed any protective film first. Neatly tape the mirrors together using transparent tape, so that the edges of the three mirrors form an equilateral triangle.
 Remove the adhesive backing from the three pieces of foam and stick one piece on the side of each mirror, approximately one inch from the end.
 Gently insert the mirrors, foam end first, into the PVC tube. You may need to squeeze the foam to make it fit. Insert the three pieces of foam rope into the spaces between the mirrors and the tube.
 Place the PVC end cap over the open end of the PVC tube, twist to secure tightly. Your kaleidoscope is now ready, enjoy the view!

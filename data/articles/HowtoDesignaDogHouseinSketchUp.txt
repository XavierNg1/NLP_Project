 Do you have a chihuahua or a Neapolitan mastiff? This article will be making one for a mid size dog. You don't want it to be too big if that is their primary shelter, but not too small either. Create the exact size rectangle that you need.;
, The top height of this dog house is 3 feet (0.9Â m).
, Unless you want a steep roof, don't go to another midpoint. Go further up the side. Be sure that you see the red dot which indicates that the line is complete.
 You can use inference to get the exact same angle or create a steeper angle for a more 'avant-garde' look.
 Push it far enough and it will be gone. Select the other side, double click and it will repeat the process.
 You want it to be big enough for the dog to comfortable go through it, but not much more. If you live in a cold environment, you want to limit the amount of air that can come in the dog house. An arc will be added to the rectangle, so you can make it a little short.
 Be sure it is somewhat proportional.
 Click on the push/pull tool and push the door in just a bit. Select the door and hit Delete on your keyboard. This will delete the door.
 To do that, click on the paint bucket. Go through your options and complete your best friend's house!

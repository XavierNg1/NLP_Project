 No matter how you plan on styling your hair, it needs to start out brushed! This not only immediately makes your hair look better, but also makes it easier to style.
 It is important to plan ahead so your hairstyle is appropriate for all the dayâ€™s activities. This helps you look more put together and avoid any awkward mishaps that could be caused by you needing to redo your hair in the middle of the day.


If you have long hair and you have to run in PE that day, plan to wear your hair up.
If you have an event that day where you need to look particularly nice, plan to style your hair appropriately.
 Regardless of what products you are using, keep in mind that they are meant to supplement the natural beauty of your hair. Use the products you need to make your hair stay in place, but not so much that your hair appears greasy or too stiff.

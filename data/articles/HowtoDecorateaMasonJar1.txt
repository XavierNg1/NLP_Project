 Clean and thoroughly dry the jar before proceeding.;
, Spray paint is the easiest to use, as you don't have to struggle trying to get a paintbrush into every nook and cranny. Choose any color you like. Metallics look especially amazing with Mason jars but any color will work well, even black if that's the look you're wanting.


Cover your work surface with box cardboard and always work in a well-ventilated area to prevent harm from the fumes.
 This will prevent stray paint from marking it.
 Spray carefully and keep it even. Move the jar around as you spray, to ensure full coverage.
 Tiny shells, fake flowers, sand, and beads can be used to decorate the external part of the jar.


Consider deciding on a pattern before adding the decorations. It can be helpful to draw the design on paper, to remind you where the items go.
 Use hot glue, as it will hold the items in place better. Maybe put more decorations near the base of the jar, and thin them out near the top.
 Real ones will need water, which may end up damaging the paint. Or even put in a bunch of twigs, incense sticks or other items, depending on what you want to display.
 Or give it to someone as a gift.

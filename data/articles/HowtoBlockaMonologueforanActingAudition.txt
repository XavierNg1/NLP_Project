 Monologues are generally directed at another character, or in the case of a soliloquy, are directed right at the audience. Determine who your character is speaking to in the context of the piece.;
, When you perform a monologue, you are stepping into the life of that character at that very moment. For instance a person in church will act differently than someone who is attending a sporting event.
 Given the circumstances of where the character is and who the character is talking to in the scene, select a starting position that makes sense. Because many monologues are performed in a room without a set, you will typically be limited to standing, sitting, or walking and pacing.
 In order to block the scene, emulate what feels natural. For instance, if you are yelling at someone, it may feel natural to start at a distance and end up right in their face. If someone has just died in the scene, you may start seated next to them, and then get up and move to a window. Respond to text of the monologue and what "feels" natural.
 The act of blocking a monologue is one of experimentation. Remember that you do not have to worry about your fellow actors since you will be the only one on stage. Play the scene several times until you begin to naturally find where you want to move each time. Then lock that in as your blocking for the monologue.
 Remember not to upstage yourself--turn away from the people you are performing for--during the performance, unless you are using it for dramatic effect. As the actor, you will have the choice to play the monologue directly to someone (usually a casting director or reader) or to no one. Whichever you choose, make sure you stay with that specific focal point for the whole piece. Otherwise, the people you are reading for may have trouble following you.

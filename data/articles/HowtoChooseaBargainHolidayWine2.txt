 At just $14 per bottle, the Morgan Grenache/Syrah might be the best bargain wine to pair with turkey. Grown and produced in California, this luscious red wine contains hints of black licorice, dark chocolate, cherry jam, and espresso. This wine is probably best if your holiday turkey is heavy on the seasonings., White wine tastes great with turkey. For instance, you might enjoy Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, or Riesling. Chardonnay is a white wine, typically dry, but fruity. Sauvignon Blanc has an acidic, herby taste that is not to be missed. Riesling, with its soft, fruity flavor also pairs well with turkey., A younger pinot noir – with hints of strawberries, cherries, and raspberries – is an ideal match for a turkey dinner.This sweetness will make the turkey even more delicious. Pinot noir is usually light to medium-bodied, and therefore won’t overpower the flavor of the turkey. Overall, the complex flavor profile of a pinot noir makes it versatile enough to pair not only with turkey, but with the whole array of holiday dishes that might accompany the turkey.Pinot Noirs produced in New York, California, and Oregon are the most prized.
While pinot noir can be hard to find at a bargain price, with some effort you can find one at less than $25 per bottle. The 2009 Sebastiani Pinot Noir by Sonoma Coast, for instance, costs $18. The 2010 Garnet Pinot Noir and 2009 Educated Guess Pinot Noir, both produced by Carneros, each go for $20 per bottle.
Similar red wines that might work well with turkey dinner include Beaujolais, Zinfandel, and Syrah.

 Place one foot forward with your knee bent. Put your other foot behind you with your shin on the ground. Now shift your weight forward while keeping your back straight. This will help loosen the muscles in your hip. Hold for this stretch for 30 seconds and then repeat with the other leg., Stand up straight and then bend at your waist like a hinge. Let your arms fall down and try to touch your toes with your fingers. Don’t bounce up and down. Breathe deeply and try to feel the stretch in your hamstrings.
 This is a great stretch to simulate exactly what your legs will be doing once you actually do the split.Stand at a table or chair that you are able to lift your leg up on to. Place your foot on the chair so that it is at a ninety-degree angle from your body. Lean your torso into the stretch until you feel your hamstrings start to tighten. As long as you don’t feel pain, you can hold it here or keep pushing slightly further.
 Consistency is important to gain flexibility. Continue doing these stretches over the course of several weeks and you’ll find doing the split to be much easier. If you try to do a split without having any flexibility in your hip and hamstrings you risk injuring yourself.

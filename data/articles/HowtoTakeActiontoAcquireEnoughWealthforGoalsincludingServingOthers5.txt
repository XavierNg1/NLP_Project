 Notice that does not say "give haphazardly." Then you can give steadily and not whimsically and you may actually be happy -- not just excited about new stuff. Excitement wears off quickly from "bling", sparkling new stuff -- big-boy/girl toys.
 Remember to give to your church, and its other outreaches. Hoarding money is not your way to achieve wealth with happiness. Save for yourself, save for your familyâ€™s future, and be gracious enough to bless "yours"/and others with education, shelter, food and clothing. Consider including those in famine, pestilence and great poverty. You can do some or a little of all that at the same time, if you decide to.

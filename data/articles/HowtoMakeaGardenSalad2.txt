 You will be mixing your salad dressing in this jar. If you do not have a jar, you can use a glass bottle instead. Avoid using plastic, as that can affect the flavor.
 You will need 3 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of white wine vinegar, a pinch of salt, and a dash of pepper. For a heavier dressing, use extra virgin olive oil. If you want a lighter dressing, use light olive oil instead.


You can also use canola, grape seed oil, or vegetable oil instead of olive oil. These will give you a more delicate flavor.
Instead of white wine vinegar, you can also use apple cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar, red wine vinegar, or rice vinegar.
 You can customize your salad dressing by adding some fresh herbs, honey or sugar, or garlic. Here are some options for you to choose from:For a fresh, herbal touch, add 1 - 2 tablespoons of chopped, fresh herbs, such as basil, cilantro, parsley, mint, or thyme.
For a sharper flavor, add 1 finely-mined garlic clove. You can also use a garlic press instead.
For a cheesier option, add 2 tablespoons of finely grated or crumbled cheese, such as parmesan.
Add some spice with a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes or 1 teaspoon of dijon mustard.
Add a little sweetness with ½ to 1 teaspoon of 1/2 – 1 honey or sugar.
 Close the lid tightly and shake the jar until all of the ingredients are combined. If any of the dressing as seeped out form beneath the lid, wipe it off with a damp towel. You can use this dressing on your salad and store any leftovers in the refrigerator.
 If you have any salad dressing left over, close the jar tightly and store it in the refrigerator. Use it within two to three days.

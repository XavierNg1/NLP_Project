 The End boss is called the Ender Dragon. She (yes, she was officially confirmed to be female) flies around the End skies. You must kill her to beat the game.


Watch out for Endermen, they spawn heavily in this dimension.
Saving, exiting, and reloading while in the End, if you have not yet killed the dragon, will cause a second dragon to spawn. Make sure you have enough time to finish the battle.
 She may take a moment to appear, so take this time to prepare, by sorting your inventory and such.


You may spawn underground. If this is the case, just dig your way out.
 These crystals, located atop the obsidian towers in the End, heal the Ender Dragon.


You can destroy them with any attack, including a snowball. Using a close-range weapon is not recommended, since the crystals explode when hit. On Pocket Edition, some crystals are defended by iron bars., You can damage the dragon using a sword, bow and arrows, or explosive items. The dragon is immune to lava, fire, and splash potions, but potions that buff your stats are very useful.


Since trying to sleep in the End or Nether results in an explosion, you can use beds to damage the ender dragon. Just place it in front of you, stand back, and then try to sleep when the dragon comes close.
In Computer Edition, the dragon is invulnerable to arrows while it is perched on top of the portal., The Enderdragon drops lots of Exp, and opens the exit portal.
, Now you have "beaten Minecraft," you'll spawn in your world's normal spawn after the credits, with all of your gear and a large amount of extra experience levels!


You can go back to the End whenever you want now, provided you can reach the portal. Several valuable things can be found there, such as the Endermen and their valuable Ender Pearls, and the Obsidian and End Stone blocks, which are some of the most blast-resistant blocks in the game that you can use.
The 1.9 update to the Computer Edition added End Cities and End Ships.

 Make sure to file from the centre of the nail's edge to the outer corners, so as not to damage them.;
, Add polish remover onto a piece of cotton and wipe away any previous nail polish and dirt from your nails. Also clean any dirt that is under your nails.
 This removes the destructive oil and dirt, as well as the polish remover.
 Be sure not to get any of it onto the actual nail; only on the cuticles and parts surrounding it.
, Two or three coats is the optimum amount. No need to be neat about painting your nails at this stage at all! Give it time to dry between each coat.
 This gives your nails a beautiful shine. Wait for this to dry completely, before moving on to the fun stage!

, The Vaseline makes it slide off very easily. To reiterate, only do this once you are sure your nails are completely dry.

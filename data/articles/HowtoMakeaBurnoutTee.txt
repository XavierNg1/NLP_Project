 If you cannot find one at a craft store, you can buy them from t-shirt suppliers or some logo stores. The active ingredient that creates the burnout dissolves linen, cotton and other plant fibers, making a design. The same ingredient does not strongly affect polyester, silk and wool, leaving a layer of the shirt intact. Possible choices include Silco and cotton/polyester blends.
 You can find devorant at traditional craft supply stores. It can also be ordered over the Internet. Fiber Etch and DuPont Devorant are common brands of devorant.

You can also mix your own devorant using sodium bisulfate, water, glycerine and printing paste. However, because you are working with acid (sodium bisulfate) it is not recommended that you do this the first time you make a burnout t-shirt.
 Wear rubber gloves before starting any work. Sodium bisulfate is corrosive and it can be a respiratory irritant., It should be 17 parts paste to 3 parts reactant. (85 percent paste to 15 percent reactant.)

Some devorant products come as gels and do not need to be mixed. Read the package instructions to confirm if you should mix the product.
 Pin a piece of synthetic fabric between the layers of the tee shirt. Pin the t-shirt to a frame or tape it down on a table. Using a fabric pen that will fade, draw a design on the shirt.,, Turn the tee over and apply the paste to the opposite side.

You can also apply the paste with silk screen techniques, from an applicator bottle, or with stamps.
 It will take longer to dry if you decide to burnout both sides of the tee., Set the iron to a cotton setting and turn off steam., Iron the sides of the t-shirt where the devorant was applied, 1 at a time, until the applied areas turn yellow., Rinse. You should make sure all devorant is washed out before wearing.

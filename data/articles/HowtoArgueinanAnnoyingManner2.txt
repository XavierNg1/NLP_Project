 Point out their mistakes, hesitations, inconsistencies, and assumptions. Don't let them proceed with their argument until every little, inconsequential detail is ironed out. This will make the weaknesses of their argument very clear to everyone, and it will frustrate them as they begin to feel like their argument isn't getting anywhere. Make little jokes and laugh heartily as you do this: as they get more and more frustrated, it will only be more annoying to see you finding it so funny.
 Stay calm, and never raise your voice or become agitated. That's your opposition's job. In fact, laughing or in some other way demonstrating how much fun you're having or how funny you think it is will make it even worse for your opponent.
 If the argument gets heated or personal, or if one or both of you will be seriously hurt by something that's said, it's time to stop. You should frustrate and annoy your opponent, not abuse them. Know where the line is and how not to cross it.

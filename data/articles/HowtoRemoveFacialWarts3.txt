 If you can, just ignore the warts because they can sometimes go away on their own. You can cover the warts with bandages or even be stylish by using a scarf or a bandanna to cover facial warts. Study shows that most warts will resolve themselves after two years.However, if the warts really bother you, by all means try the treatment options discussed above.
If the warts persist for years, or if you find they begin to spread, seek medical attention.
 Stop touching the warts and leave them alone. Practice the universal precaution of good hand hygiene so that you donâ€™t transmit the warts to others. Picking warts can worsen your problem.


Keep your hands dry and clean because warts thrive on moist areas.
Make it a habit to wash your hands before and after applying topical solutions on your warts.
Isolate your clothes and towels. Make sure that others don't use these items of yours to prevent the transmission of warts. If possible, label them so that others will know that these are your items and will think twice about using them.
 This can easily spread the virus to other areas. Remember, warts are highly contagious. Even a slight brush of the affected part can infect you or others. This can also harbor warts and spread them to other people. You may want to let your facial hair grow if you can, to avoid shaving the area. Facial scrubs and abrasives may contribute to this as well.

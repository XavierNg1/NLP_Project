 This is the simplest method to remove an eyeliner stain, because you probably already have dishwashing soap around your house. Add ¼ quarter teaspoon to one cup of warm water. Seal the container and shake it around, or stir.You can use whatever vessel you have at your disposal to mix the soap and water. However, using an empty spray bottle works perfectly. This will allow you to shake the soap and water until it’s fully mixed, and then spray directly onto the stain.;
, You can use a washcloth, a paper towel, or a sponge. Although unlikely, it’s best to just avoid anything with color, as it may transfer to the carpet. Press into the stain firmly. Avoid rubbing it, as it can smear the eyeliner into a bigger stain or push it deeper into the carpet fibers.Make sure that you apply enough of the soapy water solution so that the stain is completely saturated.
Continue dabbing until you no longer see the stain. It should fade as you continue to blot. Keep going until it is gone (or acceptable to you).
 Put a couple of layers of paper towel on the wet spot, and place something heavy over top. After a few hours, remove the paper towels and let the spot breathe. Avoid walking on the carpet as it dries. After it’s completely dry, examine the spot and determine if you need to repeat these steps.Vacuum over the area after it’s dry to “re-fluff” the area and make sure it is blended into the rest of the carpet.

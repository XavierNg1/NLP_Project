 Trace out a circle on 2" plywood and then cut it out with a jigsaw. A diameter of 12" is recommended.
 Trim three 2" diameter dowels rods to the height you want for your stool. More than 20" is not recommended for this particular design.
 Using a compass, draw a circle on the underside of your seat that is 9" across and centered. Divide the perimeter of the circle into thirds. Then drill 1 3/4" holes into the seat at an angle. The easiest way to do this is to place a 1" block underneath half of the seat so that it sits at an angle and then drill straight down.


Adjust the height of the block to change the angle the legs will be at. Experimenting before making this stool is a good idea.
 Use a shaver, sandpaper, a router or other tool of your choice to trim the top 3" of the dowel down to 1.5" wide. Then, glue and insert them into the holes. Trim and sand down the pieces which stick above the surface of the seat until the top of the seat is flat and ready for sitting on.
 You can paint or stain your stool if you want to. Otherwise, it's ready for use!

 This is the measure of octaves you can sing, from the lowest to the highest.You can find your range by singing scales, starting with the lowest note you can clearly sing and continuing until you aren't able to hit a higher note. There are 7 main voice types: soprano, mezzo-Soprano, alto, countertenor, tenor, baritone, and bass.


Warm up by singing major scales starting with the middle C. Sing C-D-E-F-G-F-E-D-C and move up or down one half step for each new scale.Which scales can you sing most clearly? At what point does it become difficult to hit the notes? Take note of where you fall to determine what your voice type is.;
, Your tessitura is the range at which you are the most comfortable, and at which your voice sounds the most pleasant.Your vocal range might exceed your tessitura. You might be able to hit very high or very low notes, but there's a range of notes that your voice can produce with greater ease and more power. Finding this sweet spot will help you find your best singing voice.


What songs do you typically enjoy singing along to? If there are some that you love to belt out, chances are it's because you can feel that you sound good singing them. Pay attention to the notes in these songs.
With training, you may be able to expand the range of notes you can sing with great power., If you haven't been using the right technique, you might not even know what your voice truly sounds like. Using the right technique will help your voice sound clear and strong. Keep the following pointers in mind as you practice singing:


Have good posture. Stand up straight so you can breath more easily. Keep your neck upright but relaxed.
Speaking of breathing, make sure you're breathing from your diaphragm. Your stomach should expand when you breathe in and deflate as you breathe out. This gives you more control over your pitch.
Open the back of your throat and enunciate your vowels when you sing.

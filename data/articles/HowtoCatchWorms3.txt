 Insert a pitchfork into the soil you are planning to collect your worms from.Again, remember that worms thrive in dirt that is moist, and nutrient-rich, with plants and crops nearby and with mulch covering the soil. Make sure the majority of the fork tenors are in the ground.
 Rock the pitchfork back and forth in a constant rhythm, almost wiggling the pitchfork in place.Worms will start to surface from the dirt.


This process may take a few minutes, so patience is key.
 Use your fingers to pick up the surfaced worms. They will be scattered, but be sure to maintain the rocking rhythm of the pitchfork., Keep your collected worms in a container with a perforated lid. The container should also have some dirt from which the worms can from, or some commercial worm bedding.


Keep the worms in a dark and cool place until you are ready to use them.

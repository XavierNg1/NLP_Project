 It's important to use the right supplies when you're making moonshine, because using equipment made from the wrong material can backfire - literally. For the sake of safety and the best chance of making true moonshine, collect the following supplies:


A pressure cooker. Use one you don't intend to use for other purposes, or buy a new pressure cooker specifically for making moonshine.
Copper tubing. You'll need about two yards of tubing that is 1/4" in width. This can be purchased at a hardware or home and garden store.
A drill with at least a 1/4" bit, for drilling a hole in the lid of the pressure cooker.
A 15 gallon (56.8Â L) metal pot.
A large plastic bucket.
Cheesecloth.
10 pounds of cornmeal, 10 pounds of sugar and 1/2 ounce of yeast.;
, Drill a hole in the lid of the pressure cooker and thread it to snugly receive a 1/4" copper tubing. Insert the end of the 1/4" copper tubing into the hole, being careful that it does not project through more than an inch. This is your condensing tube.


The tube should be long enough to go from the cooker to a sink and extend beyond the sink down to near the floor.
If you don't want to drill a hole in the cooker's lid, you can thread it through the vent and affix it there using duct tape.

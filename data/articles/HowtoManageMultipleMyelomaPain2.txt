 The simplest way to take pain medications is by mouth. You've likely taken medications this way in the past, swallowing the medication with a glass of water. In this form, medications come in tablets, gel caps, and other swallowable forms, as well as dissolvable forms, that you let dissolve in your mouth.If you have trouble with swallowing pills, you may need to take pain medications in other forms or stick to the dissolving kind.
Usually, you take these medications as needed, though some come in a sustained-release form, so the medication is released gradually and may relieve your pain for longer periods of time.
If you don't like taking pills but you still prefer an oral application, you can also get pain medications in lollipop form., Another option for pain management is a patch. You leave the patch on your skin, and it delivers pain medication to your body. It provides a steady dose, meaning you don't have a break between medications as long as you apply a new patch on time. Generally, you apply these patches every couple of days.Fentanyl is one such drug. It lasts for two to three days days of and provides very strong and effective relief.
 You can also take pain medications rectally. You'll insert a small suppository in your rectum that will deliver the pain medication to your body. You generally take this type of medication as needed. Morphine is sometimes taken in this form., If you can't take pain medications by mouth, another option is taking them intravenously. For this type of delivery method, you'll need to have a semi-permanent IV line in your hand or arm where medications can be injected easily. IV administration of opioid medication is usually reserved for patients in the hospital or on hospice.You may also get a pump that you always have with you that continually gives you drugs intravenously.

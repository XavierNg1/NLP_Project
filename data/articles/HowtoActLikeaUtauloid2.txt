 Go to voice lessons to make your voice nice, even if you have a good natural voice. Then, watch videos of your chosen utauloid singing. Then, try to match it with your own voice. Keep practicing and you'll sound more like a robot soon. Do not let it bring you down if you are not doing well at first.
 You are not like the characters at all. You are just acting like it. Do not change your own personality.
 For example, if you are Teto, tell them your name is Kasane Teto! If they really start to get annoyed by your act, tell them your real name secretly, but tell them to keep it a secret.
 Do not sing too much in front of people or they will think you are trying to get attention. But, sing a lot by yourself. And sing just a tiny bit in front of people. They will notice your voice is a lot like a robot without it being like beep boop bop or monotone.
 They will make fun of you.
 Speak it a lot around people. But, not too much or they will not understand you. Go simple like, "Konichiwa," or "Sayonara!" or "Genki?"

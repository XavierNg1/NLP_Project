, One half of the people will be the foxes, the other half will be the hounds.
 This game is designed to take place in a very large outdoor space. Ideally it should be about six blocks/a mile of playing space, although it depends on the terrain and how many hiding places there are.
 The foxes are given a 10-20 minute head start, and they run off to hide wherever they want.
 After the foxes have been given a good head start, the hounds go out and try to find the foxes. Once all the foxes have been found (or the hounds give up), the game is over.

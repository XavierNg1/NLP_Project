 If a cat came from a breeder, check its pedigree, which is a document the breeder supplies to identify the cat's breed and parentage. If you're purchasing a kitten from a breeder, make sure they provide its breed registration numbers and information about its parents.You can find a breeder using The International Cat Association's listing., There's an affordable test available that identifies the recessive gene that causes the Cornish Rex coat. If you want to verify that your cat is a Rex or was cross-bred with a Rex, you can order a test online and send a sample to a lab, or just talk to the cat's vet about administering the test.A Cornish Rex coat test costs around $40-50 (U.S.) per animal., The breed is prone to specific health conditions that don't affect most other cats and is at a higher risk for other species-wide issues. The most easily recognized health condition is hypotrichosis, or hereditary baldness. Look for patches of thin hair or bald spots, which are signs that your Cornish Rex is hypertrichotic.Other common issues include thickening of the heart muscle, which can only be detected with an echocardiogram, and patellar luxation, in which the kneecaps slide out of place and make it difficult for the cat to walk.The thin coat also offers little protection against UV light, so the breed is also susceptible to sunburn.

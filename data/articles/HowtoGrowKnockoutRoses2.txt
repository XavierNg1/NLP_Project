 This is to ensure that your plant gets plenty of air circulation. Increased air circulation will make it even more difficult for fungal and bacterial diseases attack the rose.
 Water it generously immediately after planting and whenever the top of the soil begins to dry for the first two years. They can be watered slowly with a soaker hose or simply with a garden hose with the water turned down to a slow or medium pressure. Giving them water more slowly allows it to soak into the ground around the rose rather than running off into the surrounding area.
 These roses can also be watered with a watering can. Just pour the water slowly so it can soak in right where the rose needs it. Distribute the water over the soil around the rose and extending out about 1 foot beyond the outer edge of the branches.


The root system will extend out into this area as the shrub grows., After the first two years, it will survive long periods without water but it will wilt and the leaves will turn yellow. Water it once every week or two during dry spells to keep it looking its best.


If it is being watered too much, the leaves will turn yellow and drop.
Spread a 2- to 3-inch depth of organic mulch like shredded pine bark around the rose to help conserve moisture.

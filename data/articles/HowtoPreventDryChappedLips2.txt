 If you live in a dry climate, prevent dry chapped lips by keeping your air humidified. You can purchase humidifiers at most big-box stores and drug stores.Aim for a humidity level in your home of between 30-50%.Keep your humidifier clean by washing it according to the manufacturer's instructions. Otherwise, it could become moldy or host bacteria and other nasty things that could make you sick.Start wearing less lipstick. Lipstick can dry out your lips so wear tinted lip gloss or better yet, embrace your bare lips. If you must wear lipstick, stay away from matte. It is very drying.
 Exposing your lips to the sun, wind, and cold will dry them out. Always apply a lip balm or cover with a scarf before venturing out.Seal in moisture with a lip balm or chapstick that contains sunscreen to prevent sunburning (yes, lips can sunburn too!).
Apply thirty minutes before going outside.
If swimming, re-apply the product often.
 Having any vitamin deficiencies can cause your lips to dry and crack. Make sure you are getting enough of the following vitamins and minerals, and speak with your doctor if you aren't sure you're getting enough:B Vitamins
Iron
Essential Fatty Acids
Multivitamins
Mineral Supplements

, Being dehydrated can cause dry, chapped lips. Try to increase the amount of water you drink to help keep your lips hydrated.Winter has especially dry air, so make sure to increase hydration during this season.
Drink at least the recommended 8 glasses of water a day.

 When the trip is over, the driver will tell you how much you owe. Calculate the tip as a percentage of this fare, or "eyeball" the amount by rounding up to the nearest $5 or $10 bill increment.Most cabs feature a fare ticker which allows you to watch the price of the ride rise as you approach your destination. If you're in a hurry, you can use this to predict, calculate, and prepare your tip before it's time to get out of the cab.;
, 10-15% of the overall fare is usually fine. If the bill is less than $10, feel free to give a 10% tip, but do not tip less than $1. If the bill is more than $10, give at least a 15% tip.Any percentage-based tip will be a rough representation of the duration and quality of the ride, made slightly arbitrary for the sake of convenience. Try to choose the tip percentage that best fits the situation.


If the driver did an exceptional job, consider tipping her 20% or more. Perhaps you had a great conversation, or she gave you useful advice about sightseeing in the city, or she worked hard to get you to your destination on time despite an awful traffic backup.The credit card machines inside some cabs suggest default tip percentages between which you can choose. In New York, for instance, cabs offer three default tip levels: 20%, 25%, and 30%. Feel free to choose any of these options or to choose your own amount., Add $1 per bag if you have five bags or fewer. Add $2 per bag if you have five bags or more, or if your bags are extremely heavy. Remember that these are not hard, fast rules – these are guidelines within which you will work on a case-by-case basis., If the amount is close to an even amount, just give the driver an even bill and tell him/her to "keep the change". For instance: $17.28 is close to $20, and $2.72 is slightly more than 15% of $17.28. You don't need to calculate the exact tip percentage as long as you give the cab driver a reasonable amount.This strategy is useful if you find yourself in a hurry. From the cab driver's perspective, a $20 bill may be easier to store and spend than a few crumpled bills and a handful of loose change.


If your fare comes to less than $4, give the cab driver a $5 bill. You should not tip less than $1, and a %15 tip for any amount lower than five dollars will come to less than $1.
If your fare comes to $7-9, give the driver a $10.
If your fare comes to $11-13, you can give the driver $15.
If your fare comes to $33-35, just give the driver $40.

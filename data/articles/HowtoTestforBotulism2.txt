 Botulism is a serious disease, and it is important that you see a doctor immediately if you suspect you may have contracted botulism.


These symptoms usually manifest 18 to 36 hours after exposure to botulinus.
Once symptoms are felt, immediate medical intervention is required.
 After you have noticed botulism symptoms, immediately go to a hospital and have yourself checked by a doctor.
 There may also be decreased or absent bowel sounds on examination of the abdomen, which may be distended.


An infant may present with generalized hypotonia (decreased muscle tone).
In severe cases, the infected person may have respiratory failure or Hypoxemia (low oxygen level).
Your doctor will also ask you if you had an open wound or have ingested contaminated food within 24 – 48 hours.
 There are several diagnostic tests used to confirm botulism that can be ordered by your physician. Your doctor may order one, or all, of them to confirm the infection.


Lab: Positive culture of vomit, saliva, nasogastric secretions, stool, or blood or suspicious food for the bacteria, C Botulinum.Electromyography: An electromyelogram will demonstrate neuromuscular findings and assist in confirming the diagnosis. The EMG usually has two parts: a nerve conduction study, which uses electrodes taped to your skin to evaluate your motor neurons and a needle electrode exam, which uses a small needle inserted into your muscles to evaluate your muscles’ electrical activity.Radiography: Abdominal radiographs will show a “paralytic ileus,” or lack of normal gastric motility, which results in the distention of the small bowel. A spinal tap may also be needed to rule out other causes of a patient's symptoms.

 This method will prevent the enzymes present in vegetables from causing the vegetables to lose their flavor and color.


Determine the amount of time each vegetable type needs to boil. Asparagus, broccoli, beans, and cabbage will take up to 3 minutes; whereas Brussels sprouts, large carrots, and slices of eggplant will take up to 5 minutes.
Bring a pan of water to boiling, then place small portions of vegetables into the boiling water.
Let the vegetables boil for the proper amount of time, then transfer the vegetables immediately to a bowl of cold ice water.
Dry your vegetables with a paper towel, then store them in bags or containers in the freezer.

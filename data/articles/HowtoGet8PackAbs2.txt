 Crunches can firm and strengthen your abdominal muscles, and help you get the 8 pack of your dreams. Lie with your back on the floor, knees bent, and feet flat on the floor. Cross your arms over your chest and lift your shoulders toward the ceiling using your abdominal muscles.Repeat the crunch 15-20 times, and then do a second set of traditional crunches.
Rest for 30 seconds between sets.
 Prepare as though you were going to do a traditional crunch. Instead of lifting both shoulders off the ground at the same time, lift one shoulder at a time toward the opposite knee. Alternate sides until you complete the crunches.Do two sets of 15-20 crunches each.
 You can mix up your crunches by taking advantage of a flat bench at the gym or in your own home. Lie on the floor and put your legs up on the bench so that the backs of your knees are nearly touching the benchâ€™s edge. With your hands behind your ears, crunch forward.Complete two sets of 15-20 bench crunches.
Rest for 30 seconds between sets.

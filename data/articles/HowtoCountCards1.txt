 First things first, you can't really be an effective card counter if you don't know the ins and outs of basic blackjack strategy. Sure, you could count the cards, but it wouldn't result in you winning anything. Try to walk before you run.


It's in your favor to practice in casinos, if you plan on counting cards at casinos. Unlike at your kitchen table, there are a ton of other factors going on that must be considered -- like hiding the fact that you're hustling everyone.

Knowing this game like the back of your hand is the only way you'll make money. Counting cards gives you a one percent edge. If you're betting $100, that's $1 you make per hand. The only way this 1% will result in you banking millions is if you have it down to a legitimate art.
 General strategy for card counting uses the Hi-Lo strategy. High cards are given a specific value (-1) and low cards are given a specific value (+1). When added up, they total the running count. That's it. The simpler you can keep it, the less your brain will want to explode -- so think of this simplicity as a good thing.


Understand why card counting works. It works because high cards (tens) improve a player's chances of hitting a blackjack, which pays out at 3:2. They also increase the dealer's chances of going "bust." Low cards, on the other hand, are bad for the player (who wants a blackjack and to beat the house) but good for the dealer (they prevent them from busting on 16 or lower).

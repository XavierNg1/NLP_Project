 The way to block people on the Facebook app is very similar for both the Android and Apple apps. Follow the directions below if you are using either app — there are only very minor differences between the two, which are noted below.Visit the profile page of the person you want to block.
On Android, click the button on the right side of the screen that looks like three dots. On Apple, this button will look like a square with an arrow pointing out of it.
Select "Block" from the menu. Click "Block" again to confirm your choice.
 If you have a Windows phone, it's also quite easy to block people. Follow the instructions below:Swipe in from the right side of the screen. Tap "Settings." You can also press the windows logo key + I.
Tap "Account Settings." Next, tap "Blocking."
Enter the name of the person you want to block. Tap "Block" to confirm.
 If you can't' use the options above to block someone, this should work on any smartphone. For this, you'll need to use your phone's internet browser — not the Facebook app. Follow the instructions below:Open the browser and go to m.facebook.com.
Click "Settings & Privacy" (should be at the bottom of any page).
Click "Blocking." Type in the name or email address of the person you want to block.
Click "Block."

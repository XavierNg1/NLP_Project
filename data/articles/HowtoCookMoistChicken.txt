 The formula for basic brine:Take about 6 cups of water (does not need to be exact), and add to a pot on the stove.  ;
,  Turn on the heat and stir until salt is dissolved.  

, If you are doing something smaller, like wings or a couple of breasts, you will not need a gallon of brine. You can easily divide the recipe in half. You need enough brine to submerge the meat.


For every gallon of water you need 3/4 Cup of table salt OR 1 Cup kosher salt.
 Add your cooled brine, the amount of (cold) water needed and your chicken

, Basic times:


Whole chicken 12-18 hours
Thighs/legs/breasts 8-12 hours
boneless, skinless breasts or thighs 4-6 hours

,  Your chicken is now ready to be cooked. You can fry, bake, roast, grill, stir fry, whatever method you like.  You do not need to do anything special, cook it as you want.

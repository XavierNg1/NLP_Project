 Curl up and get some sleep immediately following your surgery, and get lots of rest for the next one to two days, depending on your dentist or oral surgeon’s orders. Avoid strenuous activity for at least a week.If you experience persistent bleeding the day of surgery, keep your head and upper body elevated with several pillows while you’re resting in order to prevent choking.
 If your oral surgeon prescribed or recommended medication, use it as directed. If you were not prescribed medication, you can use ibuprofen or another over-the-counter pain medication. Call your surgeon if you experience severe pain and consult with them about another medication option or dosage.
 Apply ice to manage pain, swelling, and bruising. Swelling will reach its peak within 2-3 days of surgery, but regularly using ice packs immediately after extraction can help keep it at a minimum. Apply a zip-lock bag of ice or ice pack to your face where surgery occurred. Keep the ice on for 20 minutes, then take it off for 20 minutes., Oozing bleeding from the surgical site is one of the most uncomfortable parts of wisdom tooth removal. Keep gauze in to protect the surgical site and change it out regularly. Firmly bite the gauze to help control bleeding, but don’t bite so hard that it causes any pain. Keep some sterile gauze on your tooth by biting on it over the extraction site.
If bleeding persists, try biting down on a moistened, cool tea bag: tannic acid in the tea will help to clot blood.
Avoid excessive or forceful spitting or coughing, as this will dislodge blood clots.
Give your dentist or oral surgeon a call if bleeding persists for more than a day.
 Go for creamy soups, smooth yogurts, custard, smoothies, milkshakes, and other nutrient-rich choices that are easy to drink. Avoid foods and beverages that are too hot or too cold. Also stay away from smoothies or purées that contain strawberries or other fruits with small seeds. These can get stuck in wound sockets.

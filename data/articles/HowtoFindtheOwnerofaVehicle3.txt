 If you are either the current owner and trying to find the person who sold you the car, or if you recently sold it and you are trying to find the new owner, you should have some paperwork that will help. As part of selling a car, the Certificate of Title should contain information that identifies both the seller and buyer of the car. If you kept a copy of this document (you should!), then you may be able to find the information you need quite easily., Another document that should be part of a vehicle sale is the bill of sale. In some states, the bill of sale is optional, and in some it is required. This would identify both the owner and seller.The bill of sale is not generally recorded with the registry. It is simply one of the documents that you may have kept if you were a party to the previous sale, and it might help you out in tracking down the buyer's name.
 If the car is one that you previously owned, and you are looking for a current owner, you may be able to dig up old records of any accident or insurance claims you may have filed in the past. These records, if you’re lucky, would probably contain the car’s VIN, which you can then search online.


Contact your insurance company for help locating any insurance related documents. If you don't have the records yourself, their record system may include information that can help you.

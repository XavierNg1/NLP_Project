The electrodes measure your bodyâ€™s electricity. They do not put electricity into your body.The doctor may use gel, spray, or tape to fix them in place and create a good connection.
 There will be six chest electrodes which must be placed as follows:Electrode 1 will go to the right of the sternum in the fourth intercostal space. The intercostal space is the space between the ribs.
Electrode 2 will go to the left of the sternum in the fourth intercostal space.
Electrode 3 will be in between electrodes 2 and 4.
Electrode 4 will go on midclavicular line in the fifth intercostal space. The midclavicular line is a vertical line that goes through the middle of the collarbone.
Electrode 5 is horizontally level with electrode 4 in the anterior axillary line. The anterior axillary line runs down your body from the collarbone, 3/4ths of the distance from the middle of your collarbone to the end.
Electrode 6 is horizontally level with electrode 4 in the mid-axillary line. The midaxillary line runs down your side from your armpit to your waist.
 The other four electrodes will go on your arms and legs and do not have to be placed as precisely. The doctor will likely avoid areas with a lot of hair, protruding bones, or muscles, but will place them as follows:One electrode on each arm between your wrist and your shoulder.
One electrode on each leg between your ankle and your thigh.

 One way to gain warmth is to use an old-fashioned hot water bottle. You simply fill the bottle with hot water and then place it to add warmth. You can put it behind your back, for instance., Another option is to use a heating pad to warm up parts of your body. You'll need an outlet to plug it in, but then you can use it behind your back or underneath you to help stay warm.Never use a heating pad that looks worn or cracked. Burn marks are also a bad sign.
Be careful when using a heating pad, as it can burn your skin if left in one place for too long., Ear bud headphones may be unobtrusive, but they do nothing to keep you warm. Instead, opt for the bigger headphones that cover your whole ear. They'll add warmth and provide great sound quality., If your workplace allows it, you can try using a small space heater to help keep you warm. This solution works best if you have your own office, but if the heater is small enough, you may be able to make it work in a shared space.In fact, some companies make mini fan heaters just for this purpose.
 If layers aren't cutting it, add some warmth with a heated chair mat. These mats slip over the back of most office chairs and run down the back into the seat, much like a massage pad. They plug into a USB port, so you can simply plug it into your computer or a backup battery pack. Then it adds warmth to your back and legs.

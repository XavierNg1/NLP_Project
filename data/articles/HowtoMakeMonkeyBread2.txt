 Place the milk, sugar, yeast, and 2 cups of flour in a large bowl. Use a hand mixer or the dough hook attachment on a stand mixer to thoroughly mix the ingredients. Place a piece of plastic wrap over the bowl and let the mixture sit in a warm area of your kitchen for an hour., Add the remaining flour, the salt, and 4 tablespoons of butter to the dough. Turn it out onto a floured surface and knead it until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a ball and place it in a clean, oiled mixing bowl. Cover the bowl with a piece of plastic wrap and set it in a warm spot in the kitchen to rise until the dough has doubled in size.
 Place the garlic, rosemary and thyme in a food processor and pulse until you have a fine seasoning mix. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter and pulse again until the herbs are distributed throughout the butter.
 Remove the plastic wrap from the bowl and divide the dough into about 30 even pieces. Roll each piece into a small ball, then roll it through the butter herb mixture to coat it. Place the seasoned balls into a greased baking dish. Continue stacking up the balls until they're all assembled in the dish. Cover the dish with plastic wrap, set it in a warm spot in the kitchen, and let the bread rise for another half an hour.
 While the bread is rising, preheat the oven to 375 degrees. When the bread is ready to bake, remove the plastic wrap and place it in the oven. Bake the bread until it turns golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve the bread warm.

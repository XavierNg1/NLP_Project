 If you haven't worked with a lawyer up until now, you may want to strongly consider hiring one. Adoptive parents, no matter what type of adoption they choose to have, have mounds of paperwork to fill out before the adoption is complete. A lawyer can help you make sure everything is filled out correctly so you won't have to worry about making a mistake that could cause headaches later.
 The final step is to attend a court hearing, during which a judge will rule that the adoption is complete. The adoptive parents are then given a certificate of adoption, which acts as a temporary birth certificate until a new birth certificate is drawn up for the child.


For infant adoptions, the birth mother may need to be present to sign over her parental rights.
Adoptive parents may be asked to speak about their intent to love and care for their child.
The finalization of the adoption process is often celebrated with a post-court hearing party to welcome the child to the family.

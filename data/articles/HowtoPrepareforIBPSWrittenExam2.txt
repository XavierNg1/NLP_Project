 Concentrate more on solving these problems in minimum time as this section is the most time consuming.
 Set a stopwatch in your mobile, solve a DI question, and see how much time you have taken to solve it. Practice again and again to minimize the amount of time required to solve a question. This technique helps a lot in building up speed.
 You will eventually end up securing fewer marks, as there is also negative marking in this examination.
 Even if you attempt fewer questions, attempt them with a high level of accuracy.

 Using any analog watch with an hour and minute hand will allow you to find directions.



In the northern hemisphere. Hold the watch horizontally, and point the hour hand towards the sun.
The direction that lies midway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock on your watch is south. From there, you can easily determine the other directions.

In the southern hemisphere. Hold the watch horizontally, and point the twelve o'clock mark at the sun.
The direction that lies halfway between 12 o'clock and the hour hand will be north.

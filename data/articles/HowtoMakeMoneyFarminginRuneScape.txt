 This will give you the most efficient method on what profit or loss you will make on each farming run depending on if you purchase your seeds from the Grand Exchange, a seed shop, or a monster drop.;
, Supercompost decreases the chance of a diseased patch, as well a chance of more harvest. Supercompost is more expensive than regular compost, but well worth it.
 Farmer payments are items and foods that you give a nearby farmer to watch over your patch. This way, you don't have to run back and forth every 20 or so minutes to check up and water your patch, as they do it for you. However, there is still a chance of a patch getting diseased.
 Herb runs are the most profitable method in the farming skill. Know that if you do not have the herblore level to clean them, sell them on the Grand Exchange as the grimy version. A lot of herbs sell for more as grimy than clean.
 It may sound confusing, but every time you log out of the game, the growing time will be extended more. Waiting for patches that takes a short time, such as allotments, herbs, and flowers can be successful if you're doing another skill, such as crafting, combat, woodcutting, etc. Patches that take a prolong time, such as trees can be planted in the morning and harvested late at night. You can even leave your farm runs there overnight, provided that a farmer is watching over them.


If you're planning to stay logged in for the time being, a countdown timer program is always helpful. Set the timers according to the patch timing until it can be harvested (80 minutes for herbs, etc).

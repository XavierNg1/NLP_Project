 Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F (190 C). You should also have several cookie sheets on hand. You won't need to grease the cookie sheets before baking the cookies.If you like baking with a silicone mat, you could place one on your baking sheet for even cooking.;
, Scoop 1 can (14 oz) of sweetened condensed milk and ¾ cup (170 g) of purchased cookie butter into a large mixing bowl. Use a whisk, spoon, or hand mixer to beat the sweetened condensed milk and cookie butter until they're completely combined.If you don't have cookie butter, you can substitute peanut or almond butter.
 Stir in 2 cups (256 g) of baking mix and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Stir or beat the dough until the dry mix is incorporated. The dough should be fairly sticky.You can use a baking mix (like Bisquick). Just ensure that lists flour, shortening or oil, baking powder and salt in the ingredients.
 Portion out your dough into lumps that are about 1-inch in size. Roll each lump of dough between the palms of your hands so they become balls.You can use a cookie scoop, ice cream scoop, or spoons to portion out the dough.
 Place ¼ cup (50 g) of granulated sugar into a small bowl. Roll each ball of dough in the sugar so that they're completely coated. Place the cookies on the baking sheets. Leave at least 2-inches of room between each ball on the sheet. Bake them for 6 to 8 minutes or until they start turning light brown.For a more festive look, consider rolling the balls in colored sugar or sprinkles.
 Use oven mitts to take the cookies out of the oven. You should immediately place one unwrapped Hershey's Kiss on top of each cookie. You'll need to press down a little using the Hershey's Kiss. This will also help the cookies spread a little.Let the cookies cool on a wire rack. This recipe will make about 48 cookies.

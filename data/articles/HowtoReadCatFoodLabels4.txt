 If your cat suffers from food allergies, it's important to buy food that doesn't contain certain ingredients. Although human food in the U.S. must include allergy information on labels, this isn't the case with pet food. However, if your cat has allergies to certain ingredients such as fish, you'll have to scan the ingredient list on the back.Even if the ingredient your cat is allergic to is not on the label, this doesn’t guarantee the diet was produced in an allergen-free facility or processed on the same equipment.
If your cat has a food allergy, consider a diet specifically formulated for cats with allergies. These diets are specially processed to break down proteins in the food so that they’re too small to cause an allergic reaction. Talk to your veterinarian for a prescription.
 This is especially important if your cat has diabetes. While the claim itself isn't a “lie,” it can be misleading. Grains include corn, rice, and wheat. They don't include carbohydrate-heavy vegetables like potatoes or peas. Carbs are an excellent source of energy for healthy cats, but you should keep them to a minimum.For diabetic cats, they should be avoided whenever possible or appear towards the end of the ingredient list. Even if the front of the label says, “Grain-Free,” check the ingredient list for starchy vegetables.
 Under U.S. law, the word “natural” isn't regulated in human or animal food and is actually quite meaningless. On the other hand, no brand can claim to be “organic” unless it's certified free of chemicals and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) or a more stringent state tilth organization.

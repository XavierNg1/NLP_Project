 If you're hiring workers to help, you need to know how much you'll pay them. If you're painting for someone else, you need to know how much is fair to charge them. One to two painters can usually paint 2,500 square feet in one to two days. It usually costs around $800 a day.For a small room, such as the 650 square foot example, it should only take a few hours. Divide 650 by 2,500 to get roughly .25. This means you will probably only pay a quarter of the cost of a full day's worth of work, meaning the paint job will be roughly $200.
 If there is a lot of furniture to move or if you're painting with different colors, this will tack on extra time. If you believe the job will require extra labor, tack on some extra money. For example, if you're painting your 650 square foot room two different colors, add $100 on to the labor costs. This brings labor costs to $300., Unfortunately, paint jobs do not always go as planned. Parts of a home may become damaged, paint may spill, and so on. It's a good idea to give yourself a little wiggle room. You can give consumers an estimate roughly $50 to $100 higher in case of an accident., After you have all the individual costs calculated, add them together to get a rough estimate. In the 650 square foot example, the estimate would come to around $535. In case of accidents, you can quote about $635., If you're hiring painters, it's not always a good idea to try to calculate costs yourself. Get a quote from several different companies, explaining your needs and the size of your home. This will give you a more accurate price and help you budget for a paint job.

 Locate the transcript request form on your institutionâ€™s website. Print it out and complete it. On the form, you will need to specify how many transcripts you are requesting.


The form will also note the cost per a transcript, usually $10-$15 per a transcript.
 Certain application processes require documents in addition to your official transcripts, such as the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS), or the Pharmacy College Application Service(PHARMCAS). Complete any additional forms and put them in the envelope with your completed request form. Your institution can then include them in the transcript package.If you are sending multiple transcripts, all with additional documents, make photocopies of the additional documents and send enough copies for each transcript.
 You will need to pay a fee for the transcripts, $10-$15 per transcript, and make a check out to the institution for the total amount.
 Place the check in the envelope with the completed transcript request form and any additional documents. Make sure you spell the name of your institution correctly, as well as the mailing address for the admissions and enrollment office.


Many institutions list the admissions and enrollment mailing address on their website.

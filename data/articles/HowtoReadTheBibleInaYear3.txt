 One method of reading the Bible is to do it every day, beginning in January. If you would like to begin in another month, adjust your schedule accordingly.
 Genesis and Exodus are part of the Pentateuch (the first 5 books of the Bible) and are known as books of the law because they provide laws and instructions for the people of Israel.


Read 3 chapters each day. At this rate, you will complete the book of Genesis on Jan. 17 and the book of Exodus on Jan. 31.
If you would like to use this schedule but do not plan to begin in January, adjust your monthly plan accordingly.
 The readings this month focus on the books of the law. Continue to read an average of 3 chapters each day. Chapter length varies.


Read 4 chapters on Feb. 1; 3 chapters each day from Feb. 2-4; 2 chapters on Feb. 5; 3 chapters each day from Feb. 6-7; 2 chapters each day from Feb. 8-13; and 1 chapter on Feb. 14.

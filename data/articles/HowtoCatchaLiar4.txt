 If a person is lying, they will gladly move subjects. If they are not lying, they may act confused by the sudden change in conversation. A person telling the truth may also try to circle back and finish clarifying., Instead of following their line of thinking, think of a question they may not have rehearsed. This can throw them off and make the lie obvious. If the answer is consistent with what they have been telling you, it may be the truth.For example, if someone is telling you they lost your purse and you think they are lying, you may ask them to give you a few names of some people who may have seen it recently, instead of asking where it was last. Making them accountable suddenly requires them to change their lie or come clean.
 If the person answers your question with another question, they are probably trying to change the conversation. Put them on the spot and hold them accountable to your question. This can further agitate them and make it harder to keep up with the lie., People are more likely to use the phone or email to tell a lie. Try to meet the person face to face to ask about important issues. They may come clean or refuse the direct contact altogether. Either way, it will be easier to catch the liar face to face.

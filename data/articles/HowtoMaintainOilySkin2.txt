 The sun’s heat as well as its invisible ultra violet rays, cause more damage to our skin than any other element of nature. Most people spend the summers in skimpy swimsuits that barely cover their bodies.


Sunscreens and sunblocks help to minimize sun damage, but staying in the shade and wearing white cotton clothes helps avoid most of the sun’s rays. Wrinkles are created when the skin becomes dry and loses its elasticity.
 Sweat is a combination of dirt, impurities, and other excretions that the body needs to get rid of. By sweating, our body regulates its temperature, hormones, bacterial toxins, and emotions. Most of us who do aerobic exercises know that the longer we stay on our treadmills or jogging schedules, the happier we feel, and the fewer acne-causing toxins will be in our bodies.


Exercise stimulates endorphins or happy hormones (called the runner’s high). Meditation and Yoga are tremendously helpful to keep our emotional and physical systems running smoothly so that our body and mind are in top condition.
 What you eat affects your overall health. Nothing ages your skin more than your diet. The processed foods that we eat daily are filled with artificial ingredients that our bodies cannot digest and they leave our skin lifeless and dull. Eat a diet rich in fruits, nuts, and vegetables to maintain the health of your skin.

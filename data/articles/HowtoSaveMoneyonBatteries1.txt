 There is generally no need to refrigerate batteries, as this can cause condensation that leads to corroded contacts (battery ends) and label or seal damage. Temperature extremes, either too hot or too cold, can drain energy from the battery, or cause the batteries to begin leaking. Never attempt to use a battery that shows signs of leaking., It seems correct to leave batteries in as long as they will function, to get the most out of them. However, when batteries whose voltage are mostly drained are used alongside fresh batteries, it increases the strain put on those more fully charged. This accelerates the drain rate and ultimately loses you money.
 Keeping them installed will lead to an unnecessary drain of capacity.AC current runs from the outlets in our homes because it can travel long distances with little cost. Blu-Ray players, TVs, computers, lamps, and toaster ovens are a few examples of items that run on AC current.
 Whether they are remote controls, digital cameras, or video game consoles, always make sure to follow this rule. Doing so will avoid running your battery through multiple charge cycles and extend its overall lifespan.
 Regardless of whether it is a high, moderate, or low-draw energy device, leaving them installed even in dormant electronics will result in a slow but steady drain on your batteries.
 Corrosion can build up on the terminals in this compartment and weaken the connection causing the batteries to drain faster. If you have a spring-based compartment, rub the eraser firmly along all the spring's edges until any debris has fallen off. Take a deep breath and blow into the compartment to send off any remaining particles.
 Always follow the care instructions from the manufacturer. Most manufacturers use similar care and handling instructions, but it is worth reading the packaging for any special details.

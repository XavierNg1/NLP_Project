, Then grab the bottom corner and bring it to the center, forming a triangle. Then, fold it again, turning over the folded corner. The paper should end up being folded into thirds, slightly resembling a cone shape.









If you found that confusing, fold one side over about 1/3 of the way and then fold the other side over to cover the first side. Any better?
When you're handling your soon-to-be snowflake, always keep the point down. This is the center of your snowflake.

, You are cutting through all the layers just where the top layer stops. It should be pretty clear to see. You're now ready to create your snowflake!









, You may want to begin with a very simple pattern and then move on to more complicated patterns. Or dive in. The smaller the cuts (and the more in number), the more detailed your snowflake will be.
 Unfolding takes some patience (make sure it doesn't tear!), but you'll have your first six-sided snowflake in seconds. Tada! Onto the next!

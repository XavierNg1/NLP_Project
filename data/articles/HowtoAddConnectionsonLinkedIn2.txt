 Head to www.LinkedIn.com using your browser and log in using your username and password. After logging in, you will be directed to the site’s home page.
 Use the search bar at the top of the LinkedIn home page and type in the person’s name.


You can also search by company name and more.
A drop-down list will appear with everyone who fits the criteria you entered. It will start with the people you are already connected to and then break it down by groups.
 Just click on their name and their profile will load.
 Beside that person’s or company’s profile picture is a blue box with the word “Connect.” Click on it.


You will be directed to a new page; this new page will ask you some questions before you send the invite. It will give you a list of options where you can select how you know the person you are trying to connect to. Click on the bubble that most applies to how you know them. You can also include a personal note that the person will see when you are trying to connect to them.

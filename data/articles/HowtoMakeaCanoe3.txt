 Research what kind of trees grow in local forests. Then, decide which kind you'd like to use for your canoe. Look for a sturdy stout tree that is straight and symmetrical.


Dugout canoes are often made from cedar, willow, spruce, pine, cottonwood, and redwood. Traditionally, they were made with whatever was growing close to a river source., Walk through a nearby forest and find a tree. Look for one that's large and tall enough to make into a canoe. Remember, you'll only be using the long trunk of the tree; you won't want to use branches.


You can cut down a tree, especially one that's already dead, or you can use a tree that's already fallen.
 If the tree is still standing, have someone help to first cut the tree down. Then, make two clean cuts at the ends of your log. Make sure no branches are growing out from any part of your log. Your log should be as long as you'd like your canoe to be.


Make sure you have permission to cut down a tree even if it's dead.
If you're unsure how long you'd like to make your canoe, cut a longer log. That way you can cut down and make a shorter canoe, if you choose.
 Given the enormous size of your log, you may want to work in the field or forest where you cut your log. This will save you from having to move it.


If you decide to move your log to an off-site work station, be sure to get help and use proper lifting equipment. Logs can weigh hundreds of pounds and cause serious injury if moved carelessly.

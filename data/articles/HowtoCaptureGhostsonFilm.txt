 Any camera will do, but a digital camera that you can plug into your computer is often preferred for verification purposes because tampering is pretty obvious to a professional. Most professionals use a Polaroid camera as digital editing is impossible and the results are instant.;
,, If you plan to conduct your search in one specific area, take photos from as many angles as possible of that spot.


, Occasionally repeat your invitation.
, If you have photo editing software, it can be helpful to run the pictures through some filters in order to highlight unusual items. Some things to look for are:


Orbs - Some theorize these to be the simplest form of a disembodied soul, they are probably the most common captures. An orb usually looks like a white ball, however it can also be a different color. In most cases it is just a speck of dust or even an insect, so don't get too excited about orbs unless you can be 100% sure there is something very strange about it. Most credible ghost hunting groups discount orbs due to the very high risk of them being easily explained.
Human Forms - If you're lucky, you may capture an apparition; these are actual bodies or body parts of ghosts. It takes a lot of energy for a ghost to appear like that.
Thick Mist - Very thick mist-like shapes or streaks, often in very specific areas. Usually it's very obviously not normal mist.
Lights - Be sure you know where your light sources are (street lights, houses, etc) and that you can discount someone creating it. This a controversial capture as many can be explained.

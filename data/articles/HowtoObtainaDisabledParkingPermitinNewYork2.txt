 The City of New York has its own system for issuing permits for handicapped parking. While a New York State permit or tag will suffice for parking in a lot, if you want to park on the street, it is advisable to get an NYC disabled permit in addition to your state-issued permit. Unfortunately, it is a separate application with a separate medical certification process.


Just like the NY State hanging tag, you don’t have to have a driver’s license to get this. You do, however, have to give the license plate numbers of all vehicles that will be associated with it.
 You will need the application form (found online), a driver’s license or other form of government-issued identification, and vehicle registration forms for all vehicles you will use. Your application will be reviewed before you can go any further. They will contact you if they need any additional information.
 Unlike the NY State disability permit, NY City requires an in-person medical examination. They will contact you to schedule this appointment. If the physician verifies that you qualify for a disability permit, you will be approved. This placard should be displayed clearly on the driver’s side dashboard of the car you are using.

 In order to get a mirror finish on your car, boat, or aluminum panels, you're going to need to do some sanding. Begin sanding with a medium grit sandpaper and work your way up to finer sandpaper. While it's possible to sand the aluminum by hand, using a sanding machine will make your job incredibly easier.









For a quick polish, start with 400-grit sandpaper and give the entire area a good sanding. Then use an 800-grit sandpaper and give the area another good once-over.For a thorough polish, start with 120 grit and move up to 240, 320, 400, and finally, 600-grit., Before buffing, apply a cutting compound to the buffing tool. The cutting compound protects the metal and gives it a nice shine. Read the instructions on the package to determine which compound to use for your project.In general, you can start with a firm wheel and a brown compound to do your initial polishing, then choose a softer wheel and a rouge (red) compound to get a high shine and smooth finish., A cotton buffing tool works well for aluminum. Use circular motions to buff the sheet metal. Follow the instructions in the manual and exercise caution when using the buffing tool.
 Use a soft, clean cloth to remove the compound residue from the aluminum. Wipe until a mirror finish is achieved.

 Creamy peanut butter will work better than chunky peanut butter because you’ll minimize the mess that you might cause. You also need to find a creamy peanut butter that has a high oil content. Look for peanut butter that has a very high fat content too.


The oil in the peanut butter is what helps to dissolve the gum and remove it from your skin or hair.
You can find peanut butter at most grocery stores. Make sure the towel isn’t one you plan to use again. It might get pretty dirty.
Avoid using a white towel. It may stain.
 You don’t need to cover the entire towel. A four-inch by four inch box on the towel will probably be enough to remove the gum. Put a generous amount of peanut butter on this four square inch box.
 Scrub it with the other side of the towel, and the gum should come right off. Use a comb to remove the gum if necessary.
 You might be a little messy after using the peanut butter to remove the gum. Wash your skin with some cold water to remove any excess peanut butter.

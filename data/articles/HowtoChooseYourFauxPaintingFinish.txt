 Before you choose what faux finishing technique you want to faux paint your wall with, ask yourself the following questions:


Is the finish going to look too busy or patchy overall? Remember that when you are looking at a small sample, it is different than looking at it over large areas. That's why you should always practice on a large poster board first. You might want to paint a couple of boards and place them on the wall and then stand back to get the full effect before you proceed to faux paint the wall. Make sure if you are going with a patterned type of faux finish that it does not clash with the décor in your room. Sometimes it’s best to go with a simple color washing faux finish that incorporates all the main colors in the room and blends nicely in the background.
Is it practical? Take into account the complexity of the finish you like - is it going to be easy to touch up later? Remember that some decorative finishes cannot be touched up and so are not suited for high traffic areas.
How high are your ceilings? If the technique you are going to use requires using a roller or brushing on more than one color, you should use a scaffold instead of dangerously carrying up multiple trays up a ladder. However, if you can’t fit a scaffold in the area, then you will have no choice, therefore get your climbing shoes on because you will go up and down that ladder a lot of times.;
, If the method you are going to use requires using 2 persons, make sure that both of you will be able to fit in the working area, especially if you have to fit a ladder in there, too.
 In choosing your faux finish and the faux painting tools you are going to use, keep in mind that in small sections or tight areas, the tools might not fit. Therefore, it’s best to keep those patterned faux finishes to walls that don’t have too many fixtures on them.

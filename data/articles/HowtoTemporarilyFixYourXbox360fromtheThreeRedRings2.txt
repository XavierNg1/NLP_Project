 There are many establishments, both online and in brick-and-mortar shops, which offer Xbox repairs. They will essentially be performing the steps outlined above. They may also reflow the solder using a heat gun or reflow machine. These repairs can be expensive, but may be more reliable than doing it yourself.


Be sure to choose with a trusted establishment. Don’t just send your Xbox to the first website you find online, do some research and make sure they are legitimate.
 If you are still under warranty, Microsoft will replace or repair your failed console. You may have to pay shipping or additional fees depending on the details of your warranty. If you are out of warranty, you can pay Microsoft a fee to repair the console. The fee is less if you register online through Microsoft’s repair website.


Microsoft may repair your console up to three years after you purchased it.

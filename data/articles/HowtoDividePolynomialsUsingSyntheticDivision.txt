 For this example, you will be dividing x3 + 2x2 - 4x + 8 by x + 2. Write the first polynomial equation, the dividend, in the numerator and write the second equation, the divisor, in the denominator.;
, The constant in the divisor, x + 2, is positive 2, so reversing the sign of the constant would give you -2.
 The upside-down division symbol will look a bit like a backwards "L." Place the term -2 to the left of this symbol.
 Write the terms from left to right, just as they appear. It should look like this: -2| 1 2 -4 8.
 Bring down the first coefficient, 1, below itself. It should look like this:



-2| 1  2  -4  8
    ↓
    1

, Simply multiply 1 by -2 to get -2 and write this product under the second term, 2. Here's how it would look:



-2| 1  2  -4  8
        -2
    1

, Now take the second coefficient, 2, and add it to -2. The result is 0. Write this result below the two numbers, just as you would in long division. Here's how it would look:



-2| 1  2  -4  8
        -2
    1   0

, Now, take the sum, 0, and multiply it by the divisor, -2. The result is 0. Place this number below 4, the third coefficient. It should look like this:



-2| 1  2  -4  8
        -2  0 
    1   

, Add 0 and -4 to get -4 and write this answer below the 0. Here's how it would look:



-2| 1  2  -4  8
        -2   0 
    1   0   -4

, Now, multiply -4 by -2 to get 8, write this answer under the fourth coefficient, 8, and add this answer to the fourth coefficient. 8 + 8 = 16, so this is your remainder. Write this number below the product. Here's how it would look:



-2| 1  2  -4  8
        -2   0   8
    1   0   -4   |16


, In this case, the first sum, 1, is placed next to an x to the second power (one less than three). The second sum, 0, is placed next to an x, but the result is zero, so you can remove this term. And the third coefficient, -4, becomes a constant, a number without a variable, since the original variable was x. You can write an R next to the 16, because that is the remainder. Here's how it would look:



-2| 1  2  -4  8
        -2   0   8
    1   0   -4   |16
    x2   + 0x    - 4    R 16x2 - 4 R16

, The final answer is the new polynomial, x2 - 4, plus the remainder, 16, over the original divisor, x + 2. Here's how it would look: x2 - 4 +16/(x +2).

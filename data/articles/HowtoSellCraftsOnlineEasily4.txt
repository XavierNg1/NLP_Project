 ArtFire is an alternative to Etsy. Crafters can sell online easily by having the option to create free basic accounts or advanced professional accounts (Etsy doesn't offer different account levels). The biggest difference between ArtFire and Etsy is crafters don't have to continually relist items (and pay the resulting fee) to stay at the top of website search results.
 Get your name out there by participating in Discussion Forums and Chat Rooms. ArtFire has a smaller amount of users than Etsy which makes it easier to stand out in the crowd.
 This capability will also enable you to sell crafts online easily because crafters tend to buy from other crafters.

 Use your fingers or a clean cotton ball to apply a dot of toothpaste onto the dye on your skin. Spread the toothpaste out so that it covers the stained area evenly.


Only use as much toothpaste as needed in order to create a thin coat of paste over the stain.
Toothpaste can be used on dye skins around the face as well as those on the hands.
Toothpaste is a mild abrasive and can actually scrape off dead skin cells stained with dye. Once the skin cells have been removed, new, clean skin can come through.
Any toothpaste will work, but one with baking soda in it may work even better than others since it has larger granules.
 Use a cotton ball or cotton makeup remover pad to gently rub the toothpaste over the dyed area of skin up to a minute, massaging it in using a circular motion.


Note that you can also use your fingertips to massage the toothpaste into the dye.
 After scrubbing the area with toothpaste, gently rinse it with warm water until no traces of toothpaste remain.


You may need to rub the toothpaste off while rinsing it by using your hands or a clean washcloth.
 If the dye has faded but has not disappeared completely, you can try to use additional toothpaste to remove the rest.


If the toothpaste proved ineffective, though, move on and try another method of hair dye removal.

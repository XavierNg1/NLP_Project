 In the southwest U.S., there are lots of "straw" growing in fallow fields and open woodlands, but grain straw like wheat, oat, or others, or even split cornstalks will do. Asking permission from the owner of the field or woodland is advised because taking straw, grains or cornstalks without permission is stealing. For a more durable broom that is less likely to fall apart, it is also advised to use real "broom straw" a variety of the Sorghum plant, and that variety is called Sorghum vulgare var. technicum.;
,, Small gauge wire will work, too, but care should be taken when using it, and you will need pliers to cut and tighten it.
, Tie individual bundles of straw tightly. This will help keep the finished broom neat.
 Keep them as flat as possible. By wrapping your wire or twine back and forth from opposite sides around each bundle, they will lay closer together and flatter.
 Push it about 6 inches (15 cm) deep between the center bundles, then tie it off securely with more twine.

 Your Boston Terrier's eye might look milky or white if he has corneal dystrophy. At first, only the corner of your dog's cornea might look white, but it can quickly spread so that the whole cornea looks thick and white. The cornea may also look swollen with fluid.Boston terriers inherit this condition where fluid builds up between the layers of cells in the corneal. Eventually, painful ulcers on the eye develop., Since corneal dystrophy will begin to affect your dog's vision, take him to the vet as soon as you suspect he has the eye problem. The vet will do a thorough examination and will look at your dog's eyes under a slit-lamp (a microscope with a bright light). The vet will look for thickening of the cornea, ulcers, and inflammation in the eye.The vet will also check your dog's eye pressure to rule out other eye conditions.
 Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for the milkiness of corneal dystrophy. Your vet will try to treat the secondary corneal ulcers caused by the corneal dystrophy since these are painful and can damage eye health.Your dog will probably need antibiotic eye cream to treat the ulcers.
 The vet may suggest placing a contact lens over your dog's eye or doing surgery to graft tissue over the eye. Another surgery is available that lifts the flap of the eyeball and back of the eyeball to treat corneal dystrophy.Surgery can prevent ulcers, but it may cause scarring that can damage your dog's vision.
If your dog doesn't have ulcers and you notice he's in pain, see the vet immediately. Ulcers may be forming.

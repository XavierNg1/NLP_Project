, Gently peel the label off the bottle.
 Face it glue-side upwards on a clean surface to dry; facing it upwards this will make sure that it doesn't stick to anything else as it dries. Alternatively, place it glue-side down on a sheet of fine white paper and cut around the paper after the glue of the label has re-stuck to the paper. The method that you use will depend on how you wish to store and display your wine labels; the latter method has the advantage of strengthening the label but is probably not as collectible as keeping it free of paper.

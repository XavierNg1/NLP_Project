 You can't mark a site for offline viewing like you can in Safari for iOS, but you can save pages as PDF files that you can open anytime and even follow links from.


Other Android browsers may have an offline viewing option. Open the browser's Menu by tapping the (â‹®) button and select "Save for offline viewing". Not all Android browsers have this option.
 You'll be "printing" the web page to PDF format.
 This will preserve the page and its links in a PDF file stored on your device.
 This will open the Downloads menu. Select the "Downloads" option in the left frame.
 By default, the page will be saved as the page's title. You can change it by tapping the name and entering a new name.
 The PDF will be saved to your device.
 This will display a list of all of the files you have downloaded.
 You may be prompted to select which app you want to use to open the file.
 You can tap any of the links in the PDF file to open them in your browser, but you'll need to have a network connection to do so.

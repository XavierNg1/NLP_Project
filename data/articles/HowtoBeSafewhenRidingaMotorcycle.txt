 Most people may not ride bicycles with helmets, but motorcycles go a lot faster than a bicycle.;
, Once again, just doing it on a regular bicycle is safer, but on a motorcycle it's a lot more dangerous.
 If you do a sharp turn, it will increase your chance of falling off, plus, the motorcycle will fall.
 If you don't look both ways, you have good chances of getting run over.

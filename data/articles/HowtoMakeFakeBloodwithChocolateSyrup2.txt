 For this method of fake blood, you'll need:


1 tablespoon light corn syrup
1/2 tablespoon chocolate syrup
4 drops red food coloring.
 Stir to combine.
 Decorate yourself (skin, unwanted old clothes, face, etc.). Or, since this is edible, you can add it to food that needs a tinge of fake blood for Halloween.

 Part of the fun in getting a vanity plate is coming up with a personalized or clever phrase to include as the identifying number on the license plate. You should think about what you want it to say, but make sure it is not inappropriate because that probably won’t get approved.Come up with several variations, possibly including numbers or alternative spellings, in case your first choice is unavailable.
For example, if you want your license plate to read “TOOFAST,” you might consider “2FAST,” “TOFAST,” or “2FASST” as alternative options in case someone else already chose the one you originally wanted.;
, Most states will have an online option to enter specific characters that you wish to have on your license plate to see if that option is available for you to choose. Enter your chosen phrase and see if it is available in your state.To find your state’s DMV website, you should do an internet search for the phrase “DMV List.” Once you select one of the websites included in the search results, it will take you to a list of all of the states in the US. From there, you can select your state and it will link you directly to your state’s DMV website.On the DMV’s webpage, look for options like “Check Plate Availability,” “Vanity Plate Options,” or “Check Personal Plate.” A link like this will lead you to a page where you can enter in your chosen phrase to see if it is available.
If you are applying for your license plate in person at the DMV, you’ll need to ask the DMV employee to check for the availability of your phrase for you.
 Once you have selected a phrase that is available for your license plate, you should complete your purchase by entering in any required information and paying for your new license plate.


If you’re placing your order online, you’ll need a credit card to pay for the order. If you’re completing the process in an actual DMV office, you should be able to pay with cash, check, or credit card.

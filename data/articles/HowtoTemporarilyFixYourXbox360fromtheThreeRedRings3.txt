 Heat is the number one cause of hardware failure for the Xbox 360. The Xbox 360 needs to be as cool as possible in order to operate properly. Overheating can cause a variety of hardware issues, leading to the failure of different components.


Excess heat warps the motherboard, separating it from the CPU and GPU.
 Do not place it in a cabinet or other enclosed space. Make sure that other electronics are not close, and that none of the vents are blocked. Do not place your 360 on a carpeted surface, as it will not be able to vent out of the bottom.
 Running your Xbox constantly will increase the amount of heat it generates. Give your system breaks to allow it to cool down.
 There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that placing your system vertically decreases its ability to dissipate heat, as well as increasing the chances of scratched discs. Place your system horizontally on a hard, flat surface.
 Stacked items will reflect heat back into the system. Keep the top of your system clear.


Even stacking a couple of game cases on top of the Xbox can cause a significant increase in heat.
 Make sure to dust the area regularly to keep particles from accumulating in the system. Dust the surroundings to reduce the amount of dust in the air.
 Use a vacuum to suck dust out of the vents. Wipe dust off of the system regularly. In extreme cases, you can open your case and use compressed air to blast dust off of the components.

So if you have consumed two or three drinks in an hour, then it will take two to three hours for your body to process it completely.;
, Ask the bartender for a full glass of water, or make your way to the bar’s water cooler. It is recommended that you drink a cup of water (240 ml) for every alcoholic drink you consume. So if you have consumed four drinks, then seat yourself at a table and start drinking your four cups of water.Additionally, before you lay down to go to bed, drink another full glass of water. Because frequent trips to the bathroom can deplete your body’s salt content, try adding a pinch of salt to your glass of water., Instead of eating heavy, greasy food, try to eat something healthy like scrambled eggs, chicken, milk, fresh juice, or make yourself a turkey sandwich. Despite what you have heard, greasy food cannot soak up the alcohol since it has already been absorbed into your bloodstream. But if you don’t have a choice, eating something greasy is better than eating nothing., Because time is the only real cure for sobering up, rest is a great way to sober up quickly. Once you have food and water in your system, set your alarm for 30 minutes and take a nap.

 During your date, take 10-15 minutes and write down what your pre-conceived notions of abstinence are at that time. Write also what you think abstinence in your relationship with your partner would be like.


Will you still hold hands, kiss and embrace? What will you miss (or what do you think you'll miss) by not having sex? Do you think there's a time abstinence will end? When could it end, and why? What does sex mean then, anyway?

, Share and discuss which features you and your partner have in common, and explore those you do not.


Is one of you more averse to the idea than the other? How does your religion, spirituality, ethics and goals play into your ideas about abstinence? Do you see it being more difficult for you or your partner? How can you encourage each other, and be a team during the difficult times?
Chances are all topics and concerns brought up will not be completely addressed in one sitting. It's okay to make a second date with your partner.
 Focus on the mutual nature of abstinence and make sure each of you feels comfortable with its requirements.


Discuss sexual fulfillment, and if you will pursue it together or alone. This can include masturbation, viewing pornography, etc., which can provide some form of sexual catharsis.
 If the discussion breaks down, seek the advice of a professional sex therapist. A sex therapist's job is to help people to deal with sexuality, both their own and in relationships.

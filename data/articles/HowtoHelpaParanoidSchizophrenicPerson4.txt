 Some signs may be evident before you witness a psychotic episode. Social withdraw and isolation, poor personal hygiene, sleep disturbances, and increasing paranoia may signal noncompliance with treatment or a need for a change of treatment.If you notice signs of relapse, find out if the person has been taking medication as directed. Suggest talking to her doctor about changing treatment if it no longer seems effective or compliance is an issue.
 If you are spending time with the person, know who to contact in the event of a psychotic episode. Have the number of a couple of the person's close relative's who will help him. The person's physician and/or psychiatrist should also be contacted immediately. Tell him or her your location and describe the person's concerning behavior. These people may be able to walk you through what to do to best help.If you believe the person may harm himself or others, call emergency services immediately. You should then call the people on the list of contacts to tell them about what is happening and where the person is being taken.
 Know that relapse is possible even for people whose symptoms seem to be well-controlled. Rehearse what you should do in the event of relapse to help you remain calm. Panicking will likely only exacerbate the problem.Practice deep breathing to help calm yourself and others.
Discuss your crisis plan with the person, so she knows what to expect. This should include remaining calm and calling appropriate contacts.
Find a place for you both to sit. This may help reduce agitation.
Speak in soft tones. Shouting will likely cause additional stress for all involved.

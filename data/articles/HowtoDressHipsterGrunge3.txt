 Sometimes your best pieces can be hidden in the back of your own wardrobe. Invite a friend over and talk to them about the hipster-grunge style that you are going for. Start pulling out pieces and ask them if they see any potential items to work with. Put on various outfits and take a few photos to see what works and what doesn’t.You can also alter your pieces by sewing or slicing them. For example, with jeans you can distress them or even add a few strategically placed metallic studs., This is a great way to pick up unique and unusual items at a bargain price. Know what you can spend and then hit a few sales on the weekend. Look for vintage pieces with clean lines and bold, interesting stones. You can buy a more elaborate piece, such as a detailed brooch, as long as you intend to wear that item solo.
 Talk with your older relatives and friends to see if they have any unusual accessories just lying around. You can look at the items and use them as inspiration. Or, if the person is okay with this, borrow the pieces and wear them. Just make sure to keep them in the same condition.


For example, for both men and women, a vintage pocket watch can make a great accessory. However, don’t go overboard with the technology aspect in your outfit or you will head into steampunk territory.
 Amazon listings, Etsy offerings, and Ebay auctions are great ways to buy unusual pieces online. Try to search at least once a week to see if anything new has been put up for sale. Then, if you see something you like, do a quick bit of online comparison shopping. You can often find items by searching for “hipster” or “grunge” on the site.

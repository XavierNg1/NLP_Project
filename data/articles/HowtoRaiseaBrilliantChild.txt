 This simply involves salubrious priming of conventions. A well prepared "teacher/instructor" will be competent in all perspectives - do some research into parenthood and child development, before you have your own.;
, Get to know your friends' and relatives' kids to help prepare yourself for parenthood. By doing so, you will be able to understand their interests, what they find fun, and how to interact with them. Just keep in mind that all children are different!

, Ask questions from the folks who have been through it before. No two children and no two families are alike, but that doesn't mean you can't learn form the experiences of others.
 On a daily basis, from a young age, teach your child to love learning. Get excited with them, teach them new skills, and explore phenomenons they find interesting. As they get older, use brain teasers and exercises that pique their interest. Children are naturally creative and inquisitive - use this to your advantage.
 Children need sleep, they need to eat well, and they need daily exercise.
 This time should be for reading/learning.


Encourage your child to love learning. Make it fun.
Teach your child to read; this will be a basic source of encouragement. He will never forget the encouragement.
Help children learn. The child will see you as a role model. Your child will grow not only from the new knowledge but also from your time spent with them.
 Every parent and family needs to work out their own reinforcement and discipline techniques. Whatever approaches you take, be consistent, and do not adjust too much based on exceptions or daily situations. Children thrive on consistency and will respond to it.
 Creative play does wonders for enhancing cognitive skills and building on children's natural curiosity.


Limit the playing of video games. Video games can be addicting, and they're not all beneficial for development. Instead create manual field games and encourage social interactions and artistic endeavors.

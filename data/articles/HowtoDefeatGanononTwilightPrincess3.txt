 Sadly in this game, you don't get to use them. Zelda does. Now you will be on your horse with Zelda and you have to "L" or "Z" target Ganon avoiding his minions that he sends flying at you so she can shoot him with a Light Arrow. After she does, go up to him on your horse and hit him with your sword using a spin attack. Repeat this process until he's defeated.

 This is called the Task Manager.


Note: In the new OS, Windows 7, a screen comes up with a number of options. Just click on 'Start Task Manager'.
 Also understand that although the name of the task may be unclear, there is also a description column through which you may identify your hanging program.
 When prompted, click 'Yes'.
 Please note that unsaved changes to most programs will be lost.

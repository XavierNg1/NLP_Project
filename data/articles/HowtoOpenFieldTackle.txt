 You're legs should be at about a 130 degree angle. Be ready to sprint in any direction at any time to tackle the ball carrier.;
, Stay even with the ball carrier. Cheating to one side gives the carrier a bigger space for an easy escape to the endzone.
 Going into a full sprint will give him an advantage because he could easily juke you while you are sprinting and catch you off guard.
 Trying to make a big hit will make it easier for the ball carrier to juke you while you put you're jumping to him.
 If you can't wrap up, hold onto anything you can off him, and do not let go.
 He will hit you hard and it will hurt but you have to do whatever you can to take him down. If he is going full speed at you, do not hit him any harder than any other open-field tackle, because he could juke you easily.

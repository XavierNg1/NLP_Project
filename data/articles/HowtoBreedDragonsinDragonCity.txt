, This is where you can breed your dragons to make more varying types of dragons.


If you don’t have a Breeding Mountain, you can buy it from the game’s store for 500 gold; the Breeding Tree costs 100 gems.
 This is found on the lower-right side of the screen.
 Do this by tapping one dragon on the left side, and another dragon on the right side of the screen.


Make sure that the dragons that you are going to breed have been fed up to level 4 and above.
 Once you tap the button, it will start the breeding process.


Wait until the breeding time ends, or you can use gems to speed up the process.
 Once the breeding time ends, tap on the Hatchery. This is where you will see the egg of the two dragons. Wait until the hatching time ends, and when it's ready to hatch, tap the “Hatch” button.


You now have a new dragon!

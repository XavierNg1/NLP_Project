 When writing letters to celebrities, you have to make sure that your letter stands out and shows them that it is worth replying to. Skip the formality of typing your letters and sit down to handwrite one instead., Flesh your letter out by sharing ways you appreciate the celebrity and how their career influences you personally. Choose two or three different moments in their career that you admire and make sure you’re genuine in your praise and enthusiasm.Format your letter, starting it off with: Dear . Structure your letter into three paragraphs.In the first paragraph, you will compliment their talent and achievements. Celebrities can tell when you’re being insincere so make sure it’s a celebrity whose career you follow and admire so that you have a lot to talk about.
In the second paragraph, you will list your favorite work of theirs or something that really strikes you about their career. Showing them how much you know about their films and that you’ve followed the characters they’ve played will speak volumes of how much of a fan you are.
In the third, you will request to be sent an autograph or to have an item autographed. Tell them how appreciative you would be if they were to give you your autograph and make sure you thank them. Give them best wishes and close with your signature.
 Place your signed letter into a 9x12 envelope so that the celebrity can send an 8x10 signed photo if they choose to do so. Also include a self addressed 9x12 envelope in the packaging with your letter.Take things a step further by making things even more convenient for the celeb in question. Include the photo or item you want them to sign in the package.
If you are looking to collect autographs, include another item (a photo, a paper, a book, a card) in your package for the celebrity to sign. This will make authenticating the signature easier because you will have a reference to compare the signature to.

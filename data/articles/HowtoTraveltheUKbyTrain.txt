, There are a few options for buying tickets, such as point-to-point tickets, which are valid only for one point of departure and one point of arrival. There are also regional tickets, which entitle you to travel within a certain region of the UK for a single price, as well as season tickets that are valid for travel within a certain period. You may also be eligible to purchase a rail pass for unlimited travel within the UK for a certain period of time.


Purchase point-to-point tickets in advance by visiting websites like National Rail and East Coast. It is recommended that you purchase your tickets at least four weeks in advance to avoid paying higher fares.
Buy regional passes that allow you to travel in a particular region of the UK for a period of one day to one week. Regional passes are sometimes called Rover or Ranger tickets and are a good value if you plan on exploring a certain area of the UK.
Season tickets are available for a period of one week to one year, and are a good value if you plan on taking several trips on the same route in a small period of time. You will need to purchase season tickets from a station and provide a passport sized photo.
Rail passes are available to some residents of countries outside of Europe, such as the Britrail Pass, and for those who are residents of Europe, such as the Inter-Rail Pass. The passes allow you to travel on rail lines throughout the UK for a flat rate, for a certain period of time. The Britrail Pass is convenient if you are planning on taking several long distance trips.
 You will need to have the debit or credit card with you that you used to purchase the tickets.


Find a Fast Ticket machine at your train station of departure and follow the on-screen instructions.
Insert the debit or credit card you used to purchase the tickets when prompted to do so to retrieve your tickets from the machine.
, You may be asked to show your ticket or pass while on board.

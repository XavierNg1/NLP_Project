 The two common types of softball – slowpitch and fastpitch – require different types of bats. In general, slowpitch softball requires heavier bats, while fastpitch requires lighter bats. Before you select a bat, make sure you know which type of softball game it will be used for., Some softball teams or leagues require bats that conform to certain size restrictions or are composed of specific materials (e.g. wood vs. metal or composite). For example, the United States Specialty Sports Association (USSSA) requires that a slowpitch softball bat must be no more than 34 inches (86.36 cm) long, 2 and ¼ inches (5.72 cm) in diameter, and 31 oz. (0.88 kg) in weight. They also have requirements regarding the construction of the bat, e.g. that the knob on the end of the bat must be welded on or mechanically attached.Before purchasing a bat, consult the league or team handbook for equipment regulations, or ask the team’s coach.
 Some leagues or teams require that bats bear particular markings – for example, graphics indicating that the bat is approved by a particular sports association, or an indication of the BPF (bat performance factor). They may also require that the bat be decorated or colored in a particular way. Your team or league may also have regulations regarding the modification of bats (e.g. adding tape or a grip sleeve to the handle).

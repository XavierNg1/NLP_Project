 These springs attach to the brake shoe and the shoe anchor and hold tension on the brake shoe. Once the brake pedal is released, they return the brake shoe to its original position. To remove them, use the round part of the brake tool with a little notch. Place the round part on the anchor pin (the nob that the springs are hooked to) and turn it until the notch catches the spring, and then twist and pull to remove the spring., To do this, lightly grip the outside of the retaining ring with pliers, push in, and twist until the ring comes off., At this point the shoe should easily pull away from the backing plate. There will be another spring attached at the bottom of the shoe, but it will no longer be tensioned so you can just slide it off of the shoe., One of the brake shoes will be connected to an emergency brake line. To remove it, pull the spring cover back and slide the cable sideways away from the shoe., There will be a hole in the backing plate where the emergency brake line comes in from under the car. Use a flat screwdriver to depress the tabs on the brake cable that hold it in the backing plate and then pull it through the hole., Whether your brake is operated by a hand lever or a foot pedal, it will connect to the brake cable. Once you find this connection, use a flathead screwdriver to release the cable from its clip. Now that the cable is loose on both ends, you are ready to install your new cable.

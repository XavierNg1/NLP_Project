 Shampooing is one of the most important parts of cleaning your beard. Shampoo helps to loosen oil and grime, and generally clean your beard hair. As a result, you should commit yourself to a regular beard shampoo schedule.


Shampoo your beard several times a week. The frequency depends on how dirty and oily your beard is. If you work outdoors, sweat a lot, and come into contact with dirt, you may need to shampoo every other day.
Rinse your beard until all the shampoo is out.
Purchase a shampoo formulated for beards.
Don’t use regular hair shampoo, as this may dry the skin under your beard.;
, After shampooing your beard, you should use a special beard conditioner. Beard conditioners are formulated specifically for coarse beard hair. Conditioning your beard will soften your hair and moisturize the skin underneath. When conditioning, remember to:


Shampoo first.
Rub in the conditioner.
Let it sit.
Rinse it out., While you may think that washing or cleaning your beard every day is a good thing, over washing could cause a variety of problems. When determining how much to wash, remember that:


Over washing could dry your skin and hair out.
Everyone’s hair and skin is different. What might be too much washing for one person, might not be enough washing for someone else. Make sure to experiment and try to find the perfect balance for you., Smokers or foodies might at some point develop nasty beard stains.

Apply the mixture -- now a paste -- to your beard.
Allow the paste to sit for 15 to 30 minutes.
Rinse the mixture.
Repeat as needed.

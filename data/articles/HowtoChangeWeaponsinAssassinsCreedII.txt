 There are four to choose from:


Hidden Blade — Up on the thumb pad
Sword — Right on the thumb pad for XBox 360
Fists — Down on the thumb pad for XBox 360
Medicine — Left on the thumb pad for XBox 360;
, Just press the appropriate button (Step 1) to activate the default weapon.
 There, hold the button down while you choose your weapon: RB for Xbox 360, R2 for PS3.


Take note that these instructions work for any weapon Ezio is currently carrying but does not have a shortcut established.
 You can take this opportunity to set different weapons as your fast-select choices. While you have them highlighted, push the direction you would like the weapon assigned to on the thumb pad.
 Let go of the button to close the Weapon Wheel.
 It is the first room on the left when you walk in through the front door.
 There are several racks and cabinets around the room, so if you do not see the weapon you are looking for on the first rack look around the room to see if it is somewhere else.


For example, Venetian Falchion and Old Syrian Sword appear on the second rack on the left, while the Common Sword appears on the first rack on the left.
Notice at the bottom of the screen there is a comparison between the weapon you’re currently carrying, and the one you are looking at on the rack. This should help you decide which is right for the different missions.

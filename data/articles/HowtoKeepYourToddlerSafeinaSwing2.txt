 Make sure the swing set you purchase has booster seats with straps for your toddler. The material of the swing itself should be made of soft materials like plastic or rubber. If you are unsure if a swing set is appropriate for your toddler, then make sure to check the age range guidance on the box, or ask a representative at the store.Try to avoid purchasing swing sets that have metal or wood swings.
Some swing sets come with attachable booster seats for toddlers.
 Do this before you begin setting up the swing set. This way you can ensure that everything is installed properly. If the swing set is installed incorrectly, this increases the risk of your toddler becoming injured.For example, make sure to properly close the “S” hooks to prevent swings from becoming disconnected from the set while you are swinging your toddler.
Additionally, make sure to read, follow and enforce the swing set’s safety tips.
 Try to avoid placing your set on hard surfaces such as gravel, dirt, grass, concrete, and/or asphalt. Instead, set the swing set on loose-fill materials like mulch, sand, wood fiber or chips, shredded rubber or rubber mats.Additionally, make sure to place the set on even, level ground to ensure that it is stable.
 The swings should be placed at least 22 inches (56 cm) apart. This way you can avoid entanglements and collisions while you are swinging your toddler.Additionally, make sure the toddler swings are installed high enough to prevent your toddler from climbing into the swing on their own. CPSC recommends that you place toddler swings at least 24 inches (61 cm) above the ground.
 Make sure to anchor the swing set to the ground per the instruction manual. This way you can ensure that the swing set is stable and will not upend while a group of children are playing on it.

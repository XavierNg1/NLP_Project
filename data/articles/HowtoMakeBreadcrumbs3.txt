 Turn the oven on to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Get out 1 loaf of bread and slice it into thick pieces. If you don't have a food processor, leave the bread in slices. If you do have one and want to process the bread, cut the slices into pieces., Lay the slices of bread in a single layer on a baking sheet or spread the pieces of bread evenly across the sheet. Put the bread in the preheated oven and bake it for 10 minutes. Let the bread cool completely before you process it.The bread should completely dry out. If the bread is really moist or it's humid out, add an extra couple of minutes to the baking time.
 If you have a food processor, place the pieces of toasted bread in it and blitz it until you've got fine breadcrumbs. Or you can hold a piece of the toasted bread and rub it against a grater to make the breadcrumbs. Continue doing this will all of the bread slices.You can also place the dried bread in a plastic bag and use a rolling pin to crush the bread into breadcrumbs.
 For extra texture in your meals, scatter dry breadcrumbs over pasta, casseroles, grilled vegetables, or stews. Try sprinkling them over pasta, roasted vegetables, or thick soups. Store leftover dry breadcrumbs in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month.

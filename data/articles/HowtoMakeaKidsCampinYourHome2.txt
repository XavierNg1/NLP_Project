 Some activities for the little ones include finger painting, freeze dance, crafts, balloon games, mummy wrap, a mini talent show, bubble games, animal games, and any other fun games/activities your kids can do.
 Make sure to bring finger foods, like popcorn, Chex mix, crackers, Pirate Booties, Lays, and other snacks like that. Put them on a long table, where kids can come over there anytime to snack.
 Make sure to include everyone in the games/activities.

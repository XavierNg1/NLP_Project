 If you try to begin developing your appetite for reading on a one thousand word tome with many complex issues and a huge cast of characters you may find this stops you wishing to further pursue an appetite for reading. Consider trying to read short story collections at first.;
, Do you have a friend who always has his/her nose in a book and may have recommended several books to you in the past? If you ask someone who knows you and reads a lot what books they'd recommend for you this may be easier than trying to find a suitable book yourself. As an additional bonus you will then have a friend to discuss the book with later.
 Some readers can read on a crowded train or even whilst walking down the street but not all can read with distractions and to truly enjoy a book it might be better to read in quiet places where you can give the book your full attention. Consider creating a reading nook for this purpose.
 If you don't enjoy the book you were reading then consider why not. Did you feel it went on too long? Try short stories. Was there too much violence? Stay away from horror and crime. Often people do not have an appetite for reading because they feel they dislike reading, when really they have simply read the wrong books for them. If you did like a book see if you like others by the same author or in the same genre.
 Or read the same book as a friend. This will allow you to share your opinions of the book and enjoy it in a different way. It may also give you the chance to try books you wouldn't have otherwise have thought of reading.
 Having an appetite for reading allows you to get a lot more from books and is an easy hobby to keep.

Find the tack button, and place the tack on. You are now ready to enter shows. Click on the gold trophy to do so.
 Your horse can advance more levels the more competitions you enter. Once you come up with the list, click any show, on the words, "enter show". Your horse will appear in its tack, and do a little gif of your horse dancing, jumping, running, or prancing, depending on which sow type selected, until it is loaded, which lasts about 10 seconds.You will have to change levels as your horse advances, and also create your own shows so you can participate in more shows. As your horse progresses in levels, so will you.


A day on AVH is an hour, so 24 days have passed in one day, which is one month in AVH. Your horse may be fed treats to keep up with its happiness and needs to be fed and watered regularly, as well as receiving its shots monthly (AVH terms).

 This happens towards the end of the story, right before the last gym. Once you’ve captured Groudon, Hidden Pokémon around the land will begin appearing, including Eevee.
 You can find an Eevee on Route 116. Unlike regular Pokemon, Eevee is a Hidden Pokémon on this Route, meaning it will appear at random and you’ll have to track it down. Route 116 connects Rustboro City and Rusturf Tunnel.
 This is the default view for the lower screen, and shows a map of the area and the Pokémon you’ve caught.
 You’ll hear its cry and see the bush or grass tile it’s in shake. You’ll also be alerted on your DexNav by a magnifying glass icon.
 Gently push your control stick towards the Hidden Pokémon so that you don’t startle it. You can’t be on your bike or using skates, and you can’t use the directional pad.
 There are three possible Hidden Pokémon on Route 116, so there’s a 33% chance it will be Eevee. You may be able to see a part of Eevee sticking out of the grass, and you’ll get confirmation on your DexNav when you get within 4 tiles of it.
 If you manage to sneak up on Eevee, you can start a battle with it. You’ll be able to catch it like you would any Pokémon by lowering its health and throwing Poke Balls. The Eevee will be level 8.

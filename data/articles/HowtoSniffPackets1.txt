 Some packet sniffers work across various platforms, but most are written for a specific operating system.;
, On wired networks, you can sniff packets across the network, depending on the hub or switch that’s being used. Check your switch and network setup, since some switches may prevent sniffing from another network subnet. On wireless LANs, you can only monitor traffic on a specified channel.
 It’s necessary to set the network adapter on the computer that will doing the sniffing to promiscuous mode. This will capture all types of network traffic – not just traffic being sent to the machine or a group that the machine belongs to.
 There are several choices in packet sniffing software. They include free shareware versions like Ethereal; sniffers that are bundled with other software, like Microsoft Network Monitor, and fee-based systems like LAN watch.
 Make sure they have documentation, manuals, FAQs and other types of support to meet your needs.

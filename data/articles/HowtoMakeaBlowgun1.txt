4 or 5 feet (1.2 or 1.5 m) piece of conduit with 1/2" inside walls
Ring shank nails
Small piece of typing paper (2" x 3")
Scissors
Masking or painter's tape

If you don't have these, consider using method 2 below.

;
, Place it in the corner and wrap it -- what should form is a cone. This is your dart. The cone-shaped end centers the dart in your gun, giving it direction and speed.


Once it's tight around the head of your nail, tape it in place. You'll want the first piece of tape to catch the nail and the paper. One or two pieces of tape will ensure it's sturdy and won't fall apart.
The heavier the dart, the more penetration you'll have. So, if you'd like, add more and more tape to make it heavier.
 Don't worry -- it's not supposed to fit at this point. You just want to place it in to the point where a light line forms on the paper -- where the conduit stops. This shows you how long your dart should be.


Cut the paper at this slight indentation. You'll be left with a dart that fits perfectly in the hollow of your conduit tube.
 That's it! With the dart in the tube and a big breath, that dart will go flying for a solid 50 feet (15.2 m). Experiment to see how powerful yours is.


Make a whole bunch of darts so you have plenty of ready-to-fire ammo.

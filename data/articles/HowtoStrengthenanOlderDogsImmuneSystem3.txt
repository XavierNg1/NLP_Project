 Exercise helps to keep your dog relaxed, fit, and healthy. Stress can have a negative impact on the immune system. As a result regular exercise is important. Some older dogs do not get adequate exercise because many owners feel it is too hard on them physically. Instead, you should adjust the type of exercise you give older dogs.For example, take your dog for a shorter walk daily. Instead of walking your dog for an hour, try two half hour walks each day.
 Another way to give your older dog exercise is by playing with them. Again, you may need to modify the type of play so that you do not injure your older dog. For example, if your dog likes to play fetch, throw the toy a shorter distance. Alternately, if your dog enjoys playing tug of war, purchase softer toys and play in a less vigorous manner.


Always play in a carpeted area so that your senior dog has enough traction., Swimming is an excellent way to provide your older dog with exercise. It is a low impact activity that is easy on the joints, and still helps to develop muscle strength. You can let your senior dog swim in your pool or take them to a water therapy clinic in the area. Many of these clinics will have time set aside for dogs to swim in the pool and use the facility for a small fee.If you take your dog to swim outside, make sure that you find a calm spot that does not have many waves.

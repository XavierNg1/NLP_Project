 A variation of the lying chest flye is the back flye. You must lie on a raised surface, like a workout bench, so your arms can hang down. Rest your arm at a 90 degree angle while you hold a hand weight.








If you do not have a workout bench, you may lie on the edge of a bed, an exercise ball, or a chair. You may also bend forward at the waist so your chest is parallel to the floor.
 Starting with your arm hanging down, squeeze your back muscles as you lift the weight until your arm is straight out to the side. Make sure to keep your elbow slightly bent.
 Continue lifting the weight until your arm is parallel to the floor. This should be about as far as you can lift the weight due to mobility. Hold the weight there for a few counts as you squeeze your back muscles.
 In a controlled manner, slowly lower the weight. Don't let it just fall back to the floor. Use your back muscles to lower the weight to the floor. Repeat with the other arm.








You can alternate arms with each repetition, or complete a certain number of repetitions with one arm before switching to the next.

Cut one end off the swiss roll at a forty-five degree angle.
Position it to form the peak of the one.
Cut a piece from the other end, longer than the cake is wide.
Use this to form the base of the one.;
, Cover the whole cake in buttercream using a palette knife. This example has used white (plain) buttercream, but you can use whatever colour you like.
 Decorate the cake with sweets.


In the example, the cake has white chocolate buttons covered in hundreds and thousands around the base of the cake, and;
dolly mixtures around the top to emphasise the shape of the one.
 The ones used in this example are sugar models available from any good sugar craft supplier, but you could use plastic toys (as long as your child doesn't eat them).

 A variety of websites exist that allow you to register for an account and contribute articles or reviews on many topics.


Perform an Internet search using keywords such as "article directory" to locate free websites that will allow you to publish articles.
Search for article or review websites that cater specifically to your affiliate niche. For example, if you want to promote affiliates that sell books, you can search for book review websites that allow you to post affiliate links next to your own book reviews.
 Some websites may limit the amount of affiliate links you can place into each article.
 Internet users who land on your article page may be searching for information or products that they want or need.
 Visitors to the article website will then have the opportunity to click on the affiliate links within your articles.

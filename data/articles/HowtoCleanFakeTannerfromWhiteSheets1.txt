 It is best to use a bathtub for this as it is large enough to hold the sheets in and wonâ€™t overflow. Once the bathtub is filled with hot water, add a small cup of biological washing powder and stir well with a large spoon or stirrer to create the cleaning mixture.


Biological detergent has enzymes in the powder that help clean stains that non-biological detergent does not contain.;
, Push the sheets down with the stirring tool to make sure that all of the fabric is submerged. Make sure to leave the sheets soaking in the bathtub overnight to let the washing powder clean effectively.
 The morning after the soaking take the sheets (use a plastic laundry basket to not get the floors wet) and run the washer on a warm cycle. When the washer is finished, dry the sheets on a clothes line or in the dryer. Once dry the sheets should be completely clean and white.

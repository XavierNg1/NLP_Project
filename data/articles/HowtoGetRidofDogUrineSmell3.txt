 Removing odors that are set in hardwood is difficult, but luckily, wood is more tolerant of stronger cleaning agents. Mix a solution that is 50% white vinegar and 50% water. Rub the solution into the urine stain vigorously with a soft sponge. Let it cure for 5-10 minutes. Then, wipe up the solution with a clean, dry towel.You can sprinkle the spot with a few tablespoons of baking soda too for some additional cleaning power after using the vinegar solution. Vacuum the soda up after it sits for a few hours or overnight.
 Soak a clean facecloth or hand towel in 3% hydrogen peroxide until it is saturated but not dripping. Wring the towel if necessary, and place the towel over the urine-stained area. Let the towel sit for 2-3 hours to deodorize the offending spot.


If the floor is still damp when you remove the hydrogen peroxide towel, wipe the area dry with a clean cloth., If the smell of the stain is not dissipating, you have the option of sanding down your wood floor. This is not to be undertaken lightly because it is expensive and time consuming, but it may be the best option to remove very deep odors. Sanding removes the top layer of wood and will effectively polish out your odors by buffing away the surface layer they live in. Contact a professional contractor for a quote to perform this work without damaging your floor.Sanding is simpler to do with unfinished wood (a deck, for example) but can be accomplished with finished hardwood inside. A professional can help you match your existing finish properly.

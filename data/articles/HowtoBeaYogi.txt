 You are a yogi or a yogini if you practice yoga for health, beauty, strength, relaxation, or healing. You are a yogi or yogini if you practice yoga for inner peace, happiness and enlightenment. You are a yogi or yogini if you are enlightened. Enlightenment means to live in God, in the light, in a cosmic consciousness. , In modern yoga, your religion can be your preference. Yoga teaches the unity of all religions. You can be a Yogi and a Hindu, a Christian, a Muslim, a Buddhist or an Atheist. An Atheist can be a yogi, if he or she wants to realize inner peace and happiness.


You can be a Christian yogi if you want. The most important Christian yogis were the Desert Fathers and Mothers . Their enlightened master was the Holy Antonius .
 The three great books of yoga are the Yoga-Sutra from Patanjali,the Hatha-Yoga-Pradipika from Goraksha,and the Bhagawad Gita from Krishna.Therefore the basic yoga techniques are positive thinking (Patanjali), meditation (Patanjali), body work (Goraksha), praying (Krishna), and loving all beings (Krishna).
 Important modern yoga masters are Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Jaggi Vasudev , Swami Sivananda,Anandamayi Ma,Sai Baba,Amritanandamayi (Amma),and Mother Meera. They teach the basic features.
 It is a good idea to get an initiationfrom an enlightened master. He or she will open the doors of your enlightenment energy (kundalini-energy).However, realize that you have to practice and realize your enlightenment on your own. And have patience â€“ enlightenment will appear when the time is right for you.
 Spiritually, human beings can be compared to onions. Tension and conflict must be dissolved layer by layer. When one layer is peeled away, the next quickly appears at the surface until the inner core is revealed. At this point, a lasting inner joy is found, and the yogi or yogini lives in the light (in spite of the reality that there is still much to be done).

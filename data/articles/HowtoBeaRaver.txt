 This is an open-minded community that values individuality, so express yourself through your appearance! Try funky graphics, patterns and colours, and keep in mind that many events will have black lights to make neons glow. Also try playing with different textures of fabrics, such as faux fur or silk. Keep in mind, though, that you may get hot and sweat from all of the dancing you'll be doing. Don't feel pressured to dress in a specific way (unless there's an official dress code of course). Most importantly, wear whatever makes you happy.;
, If you would prefer not to wear makeup, that's also great! Some people choose not to wear any makeup due to sweat from dancing. Remember, everyone, not only women, can express themselves via makeup in any way they choose. Some people go for colour, and some people draw designs on their skin with makeup or temporary tattoos. Get creative!

, If you think you don't know how to dance, you're only lying to yourself. Try to let the music take over your body and don't overthink it. You can find tutorials on certain dance moves and styles online, or you can scan the crowd at the event for inspiration.If you don't want to dance you don't have to; there's always a place to just chill and take a break, but a huge part of the rave culture is letting go of inhibitions and moving to the music.
 When you're starting out with shows, just hold them in your hands while you dance at first, and let your hands move naturally. Once you start feeling comfortable, play with them a bit. Try attaching them to your clothes or your body to accentuate the way you move, or getting EL wire and making your own light-up rave gear. Have fun with it! Also, try to practice in front of a mirror in a room. Watch the way the light flows, and use the reflection as a guide to improve your dancing and invent new moves.

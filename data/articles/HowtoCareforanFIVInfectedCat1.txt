 It is important to give your cat a good diet in order to keep him or her as healthy as possible despite the FIV. Ask your veterinarian about good, quality brands of cat food.;
, Dry kibble is the best food you can feed your cat, as wet food has a tendency to build up on teeth, causing tartar buildup that can lead to infections. Your primary goal should be to do everything you can to keep your cat infection-free because FIV causes it to be very susceptible to infections., Vets often recommend life-stage diets from Hills, Purina, and Royal Canin. These diets provide for the specific nutritional needs of young animals (under 12 months of age), adults (classed as 1 â€“ 7 years), and senior animals (over the age of 7 years). Matching the life-stage diet to the age of your cat can promote longevity.

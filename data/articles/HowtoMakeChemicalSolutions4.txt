 When working with strong chemicals and solutions you want to make sure that your body is protected from harm. Wearing a lab coat, close-toed shoes, eye protection, and gloves are essentials when handling these compounds.


Wear a lab coat that is made of an inflammable material.
Eye protection should have side shields to protect from splashes across the face.
 When mixing solutions together, volatile gases can be formed and escape into the air. Some chemicals can only be handled in a chemical fume hood found in a laboratory. If working at home, open windows and have a fan blowing to make sure the air circulates.
 When diluting strong acids, always add the acid to the water. When water and acid mix, the reaction is exothermic (releases heat) and can be explosive if the water is added to the acid instead of the other way around.Refresh your memory with the proper safety precautions every time you work with acids.

 When you're arguing with someone, stay calm and speak in an even tone. Don't get all worked up. This will make you look like you can't think clearly, or are just rattling off a list of pre-prepared arguments, instead of really thinking about the issue.
 Have solid evidence (not relying on anecdotes!) for the arguments that you make. Solid evidence does not include things that are frequently disputed, like the Bible. Solid evidence should be indisputable to anyone who sees it, regardless of what they believe or how they feel about an issue. You can use less solid evidence, but it won't work out very well for getting people to take you seriously.
 When you come to a conclusion, you'll want to explain that conclusion and how you arrived at it to the person you're arguing with. This will show your thought process and help them understand you and your ideas much better.
 Logical fallacies and false equivalencies are arguments that are wrong because you're looking at the issue wrong or using evidence that isn't really evidence. Try to step back from your argument and look at how someone else might see it.


An example of a logical fallacy is to say that because something is true in one situation, it is always true. This is known as misleading vividness, and causes generalization.
Another example would be attacking the person instead of their argument, known as the ad hominem fallacy.

 Any microwave-safe plate will work, but a pie plate is especially useful since it has raised sides. Keep the nuts to a single layer for even toasting and make sure that the "x" marking made in the shell is not covered by other nuts or facing the bottom of the dish., The walnuts should be cooked on full power, and it will usually take several intervals before they finish toasting. The shells will not deepen in color like they do when toasted in the oven or on the stove, but they will become fragrant and the shell should begin to peel slightly at the cut part of the "x.", Stirring the nuts allows them to toast evenly. Keep as many “x” marks showing even after you stir the nuts, but if the marks become covered, the nuts should still toast without much problem.

 If you write a diary and leave it out for them to see, they're sure to believe it! It should be full of your "mermaid experiences." You can also take some photos of you if you have a fake mermaid tail.;
, Most mermaids, once wet, transform. You should only do this once people know about you.
 Whether it's your hair or what you wear, people are more likely to believe you if something changes!

, If someone asks you over, say you're busy every time it's a sunny day. They will notice that something is strange.
 This is a very important step! Grow your hair out long and chose either a light, natural-looking tan or to keep your skin very pale (depending on whether you are a surface-dwelling mermaid or more of a deep sea type). As for your makeup, keep it natural with a little blue, green, or shimmery purple eyeshadow.
 If you're invited to go swimming or anything near water, say you can't. Don't give reasons, just act like you're kind of flustered and you're trying to come up with an explanation. Never out-and-out lie, though. Act more as if you want more than anything to join them, but you just can't.
 Act weird on the full moon night, pretend to be hypnotized, and act not like yourself. People will catch on.

 It is very difficult, almost impossible, to calculate or estimate how much food you're going to need to prepare if you don't know how many mouths you'll need to feed. This is a good reason why you should begin planning the food for a party weeks ahead of time. When you know how many guests you'll have, the rest is simply a matter of mathematics.
 If your party is only serving hors d'oeuvres, then you should use the following estimates: an average guest will consume 5 hors d'oeuvres per hour for the first 2 hours of a party and 3 hors d'oeuvres per hour for every additional hour. If you plan to serve a meal after the appetizers, cut the estimations down by a third or a half.
 If you're offering chips and dip--or chips and no dip--as a snack, you'll want approximately 1 lb. of chips and 1 pt. of dip for every 10 to 12 guests. Increase the amounts if you do not plan on serving a meal later.


Pita and tortilla chips weigh more than potato chips, which means that 1 lb. of pita or tortilla chips will actually be less food than 1 lb. of potato chips. If you're going to serve pita or tortilla chips, be sure to compensate for the disparity by buying a little more.
 For non-formal parties, pizza is a quick and easy way to satisfy the hunger of guests. When serving pizza as the main meal, you can estimate that a large (10 in.) pizza will feed 2 to 3 people. If you're serving other food alongside the pizza, you'll only need approximately 1 to 2 slices per guest.
 If your dessert is a cake or pie, plan to serve 1 slice per guest. If your dessert is cookies or pastries, plan to serve 2 per guest. If your dessert is ice cream, then you should have 1 half-gallon for every 5 to 8 guests.
 If you're preparing a dinner meal from scratch and you need to know a general rule of thumb for how much food to prepare, then you can safely estimate that you'll need 1 lb. of food per guest not including dessert or drinks.

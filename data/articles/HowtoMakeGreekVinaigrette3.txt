 Add 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of fresh lemon juice, 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of red wine vinegar, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of dried oregano, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of black pepper, 1 garlic clove, ¼ cup (44 ml) of extra virgin olive oil, and ¼ cup (44 ml) of fat-free chicken broth to a large bowl. Use a whisk to thoroughly blend all of the ingredients together.If you don’t have any fresh garlic, substitute ⅛ teaspoon (.3 g) of garlic powder.
 After you’ve mixed all of the ingredients together, it’s important to give the flavors time to meld. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let the vinaigrette sit for 1 to 2 hours to get the most flavorful dressing., If you don’t plan to use the vinaigrette right away, transfer it to a glass jar or bottle with a lid. Store the dressing in the refrigerator, and use it up within a week.If the dressing thickens up at all after it’s refrigerated, stir or shake it before use.

 It's great to have friends but you need to be able to know how to entertain yourself. Try going for a walk in the woods, or renting movies and having a night in.;
, If you are comfortable with who you are, you will be less likely to have to follow the crowd or seek acceptance from others.
 By learning more about yourself, you know your values and morals and you can stick to them.
 Make clothes that you feel the best in, not clothes that are considered trendy or "in". Remember clothes don't necessarily have to be expensive to be cute. Experiment and shop in a few different stores until you develop your signature style.
 You will never be truly independent if you feel the need to seek other people's confirmation or acceptance. Instead, seek new ways to improve yourself and become a better person.
 If you are allowed to, you may even want to change your hair color. Choose something you love and something you feel that represents the true you.
 While it's important to respect and take into account other people's opinions, you should always have a sense of what you believe in.

 You can marinate almost any food, although some foods work better with a red wine marinade than others. Consider marinating a food that also has robust, earthy flavors similar to those found in red wine. Good foods to marinate in red wine include:


Steak or beef
Chicken
Pork
Salmon
Tofu
Eggplant and mushrooms

, Acidic foods are important in a marinade because they tenderize the food you're marinating. Since you're making a red wine marinade, most of the acid will come from the red wine, although you could also add other acidic foods to develop flavor. You should use 1/2 cup to 1 cup (120 to 240 ml) of acidic liquid for your marinade. Other acidic foods include:Red wine vinegar
Honey
Dijon mustard
Tomato puree
Worcestershire sauce

, To give the red wine marinade extra flavor, you should include 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup (60 to 120 ml) of oil or fat. For a basic marinade, you could just add olive oil or melted butter. But if you want to add additional flavor, try using:Peanut oil
Sesame oil
Walnut oil
Grapeseed oil

, You'll only need to add 1/2 teaspoon to 2 teaspoons of seasonings to the marinade, but they'll give a lot of flavor to your overall dish. Think about the other flavors you're serving with the meal so you choose herbs and spices that work well together. Consider adding:


Spices: salt, pepper, cayenne, curry, onion powder, allspice, cinnamon, paprika
Herbs: rosemary, parsley, sage, cilantro, horseradish, wasabi, ginger

, Once you've chosen the oil, herbs, and spices to add to the red wine base, mix them together in a small mixing bowl. Stir together the red wine (and any other acidic foods you're using) with the oil until they're combined. Then you can gently stir in any fresh herbs or seasonings.Taste the marinade and adjust the seasonings according to your liking before you use the marinade.

 This single knot ponytail is a subtle and versatile hairstyle that is extremely easy to do. Begin by gathering the hair behind your ears and securing it in a low ponytail with a clear elastic band, while the hair at your temples loose. The two loose sections should each be about the width of two fingers.








If you normally brush your hair before putting it in a ponytail, do so before making the low ponytail. Brushing your hair gives your style a sleeker look, while keeping it un-brushed will give it more texture and hold.
Using a clear elastic helps the elastic blend in with the hair, but you can your normal hair elastic if you arenâ€™t worried about it showing.;
, Hairspray gives your hair more texture and hold, which especially important for this look because extra hold is needed to keep the hair you will knot from unravelling.
 After you mist the two sections of hair with hairspray, pull both of the hair sections away from your face and over the base of the ponytail. Knot the sections together as you would with a shoelace. Make sure the knot is directly over the hair elastic so that the hair elastic is hidden.
 After you knot the sections of hair at the base of the ponytail, wrap the two sections of loose hair behind the base of the ponytail so that they are behind the hair elastic.
 Once you have wrapped the sections of hair around the hair tie, pin the sections of hair under the base of your ponytail at the back of your head to secure your style. If you have especially long hair, tuck the ends of your hair into the pulled back hair at the back of your head to hide them. Give your hair a quick spray of hairspray if you wish to make your hairstyle last all day!

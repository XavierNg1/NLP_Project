 If the person appears to be increasingly upset, depressed, irritable, or anxious over a few weeks, consider reaching out to your work, school, or community about ways to help them.


If in school, talk with a teacher, school counselor, or advisor about the changes in their behavior.
If at work, talk with a supervisor or colleague about if they can offer additional support.
If at home, talk with other relatives or friends for advice.
 Insecure people may feel like they have a limited support system, or don't trust those around them. They may have difficulty with coping, and instead use unhealthy ways to cope. Approach them about talking with a counselor as a way to cope with what's bothering them.Remind them that counselors are non-judgmental and focus on providing support and healing.
Help them to find counselors through their school, community, or place of worship. Help them to normalize going to counseling for support.
See if there are support groups available, depending on the issue or insecure that they're facing.
 Make sure that an insecure person knows that they're not alone. Show them that people care about them. Encourage them to connect more with the supportive people in their lives.Reach out to positive and supportive people. Discuss with those supportive people that more encouragement is needed for those who are feeling insecure.
Help them focus on ways to feel included. Encourage them to do new and different things. Find people who can go with them, so they feel less alone or anxious.
Identify ways to encourage independence in them. They may feel like they can't do things on their own. Teach them how being more independent will make them feel more confident and less insecure. Be positive and supportive as they find ways to cope better with what's bothering them.

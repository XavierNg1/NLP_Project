 There is an art to it. However, since you're blending it up anyway, just try and get as much meat as possible. But don't get any of the pit(seed) or skin!









To really milk the mango for all it's worth, once you think you have as much of it off the pit as possible, grab the pit and the skin and wring it up and down with your hands. Sure, your hands will get covered and sticky, but you'll get every last milliliter of juice you can.;
, Appreciate your blender by making sure the ice is in manageable chunks. If you don't have plain yogurt or skimmed milk, you can easily substitute different flavors and different fat percentages.
 If it's too runny, add bananas or more yogurt.
 Serve and enjoy immediately!

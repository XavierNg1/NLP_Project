 Cat shampoos can come in liquid or solid form (bar shampoos). Only bathe your cat if it is excessively dirty, for example covered in mud, or if it has something sticky or smelly stuck in its fur. Baths are also only recommended if your cat is calm enough to tolerate them., Waterless sprays (and foams) are great alternatives to the traditional shampoo. These cleaning products are great for cats that detest water. Simply spray your catâ€™s coat with the product and let it do the cleaning.Because sprays are being left on the coat, be sure that they are hypoallergenic before using them on your allergy-prone cat.
 Wipes are a great, no-fuss way to clean your cat as well. You can purchase safe, hypoallergenic wipes online or from your local pet store. Earthbath, GNC, and Whisker City sell hypoallergenic cat wipes.

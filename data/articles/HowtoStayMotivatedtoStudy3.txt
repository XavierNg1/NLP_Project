 Before you get started do whatever you need to do to help yourself relax and clear your head. You might try some stretches or light exercise, breathing techniques, meditate for a few minutes, or just queue up a playlist of music that helps you study. During this time you might also go over in your head what your intentions are for this study session., If your friends are hassling you about hanging out, it will be hard to stick to your study plans. Set firm boundaries with your pals about when and for how long you’ll be studying, and don’t let up.For instance, you might say, “Sorry, guys, but I really have to study my French words tonight. I won’t be able to talk or hang out. I will make time for you on tomorrow.
If they try to persuade you to skip out on studying, say, “Studying is my top priority right now. I hope you understand.”

, If your phone has a “do not disturb” mode, set it during your study time. This helps you stay motivated in your studies by silencing any non-emergency calls and select notifications.


If your phone doesn’t need to be on to take important calls, turn it off. The less distractions you have, the better., If your dorm room or bedroom doesn’t lend to effective study habits due to distractions, it may be a good idea to move to a new environment. Being in the right environment means you’ll have less distractions and will be more motivated to stick to your study regimen.Try a local library or coffee shop. Bring along headphones and tune into a classical music station to sound out others around you.

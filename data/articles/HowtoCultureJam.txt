 Learn about some of the destructive methods of large-scale consumerism and about the unethical dealings of multinational companies like Walmart and Nike. Read subversive literature, like "Steal This Book" or "No Logo.";
, Maybe your group should join a local jammer network. Pick out a target and get some ideas formulating. If you can't think of any ideas, do some research on jamming and learn from the actions of fellow jammers and activists.
 The jammer must be creative and flexible. You have a wide range of tools at your disposal: Markers, spray paint, fliers, wheat paste, stickers, paint, etc.
 Make it something that would catch your eye, and watch out for employees, officers, and live security-cams. Hint, don't forget that the infamous dark dome cameras on supermarket ceilings do not have 360 degree vision, and are in blurry black and white.
 Hit different communities, to shock people who never saw your eye-catching work.

 In all of your interactions with friends, coworkers, and strangers, set respect and civility as a baseline.


Say "please," "thank you," "pardon me," and other polite phrases.
Be patient and considerate. Don't rush people, cut in line, or perform other acts of selfishness.
 Take at least one opportunity each day to say or do something nice for someone.



Let your friends and romantic partners have private time.
Do not invite yourself to someone else's event.
Give your coworkers personal space and do not discuss topics that may be uncomfortable for them.
 In social situations, whether personal or professional, it is more productive and respectful to discuss rather than demand. If you demonstrate a mature willingness to compromise, others will be more willing to work and spend time with you.

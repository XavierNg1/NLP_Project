 This is a program that was originally created to help run programs with ease from any Java-supporting platform. Instead, it has turned into an attack vector for hackers.Although some programs still use Java, if you don’t absolutely need it, disable it.
 From here, launch the Java app (it looks like a steaming coffee mug). When you open the app, it will have a similar set up to your settings menu—there will be tabs across the top. Choose the tab that’s labeled “Security.”


Find the single check box. This will be titled “Enable Java content in the browser.”
Un-check this box. Click OK. Now you’ve disabled Java., If you need Java for work or to run a certain program that you can’t live without, you can enable it in a single bowser. To do this, re-launch the Java app. There will be a tab on the top that says “Advanced.” Within this tab, you’ll see and item titled “Default Java for browsers.”


A list of your browsers will appear when you click to expand “Default Java for browsers.” The list will have boxes next to them. Check the boxes next to a browser if you wish to run Java in that browser.

 The color does not matter, although you may want to consider using a darker-colored marker. This method works exceptionally well on dry erase boards and is safe to use on smooth, plastic surfaces. It may not be as effective on textured surfaces, however; instead, consider using some rubbing alcohol or baking soda and toothpaste.;
, Dry erase markers contain solvents, which help dissolve the permanent marker.
 The permanent marker stain should come off with the cloth and dry erase marker.
 If for some reason the dry erase marker dried up and you are unable to wipe it off (and thus the permanent marker) try spraying the area with a glass cleaner and then wiping it off with a paper towel.

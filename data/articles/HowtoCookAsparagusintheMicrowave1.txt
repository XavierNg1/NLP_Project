 If using fresh asparagus instead of frozen asparagus, make sure the spears you choose, are firm and bright green. The tips should also be firmly packed together.Asparagus spears can be fat or skinny. Thicker spears takes a little longer to cook, but both are equally flavorful and nutritious. No matter, which you choose, though, the spears should be evenly sized.;
, Clean the asparagus by rinsing them thoroughly under cold, running water, gently rubbing the tips to loosen any dirt, sand, or debris.


Asparagus is grown in sandy soil and usually has some debris in the tips. As such, a thorough rinsing is important.
Pat dry with paper towels once rinsed.
 Use your hands or a knife to snap off the bottom 1/3 of each spear.


Usually, this will be about 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm).
These ends are especially woody and are generally not very appetizing.
You should be able to roughly estimate where the right breaking point is by gently bending the spear a few times near the bottom. The point at which the stalk turns tender will usually be the easiest, most natural breaking point, and you can usually break the bottoms off at this point with your hands.
 Use a vegetable peeler to scrape off the rough scales or knobs on the outside each stalk.


This is not necessary, but it does give the spears a clean look. It can also be especially good if you are using thick asparagus.
You only need to peel the lower 2 inches (5 cm) or so of the spear.

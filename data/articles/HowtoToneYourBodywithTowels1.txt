 Preparing your muscles for exercise is vital to injury prevention, especially with sliding exercises that require stabilization. Go for a run outside, jump rope, or do jumping jacks (at least 40 repetitions). Dynamic stretches, such as high kicks, high knees, and butt kicks also aid in stretching out your muscles.

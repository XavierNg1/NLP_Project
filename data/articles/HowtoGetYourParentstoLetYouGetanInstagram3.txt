 If there were some conditions to get your account, make sure you do what you say you would. Keep your account private, don't change the password if you share it with them, and don't post explicit or offensive photos. This is especially important if your parents were hesitant to let you on in the first place. Show them that you deserve the responsibility and can handle it maturely.
 If they want to know what kinds of accounts you follow, be open and let them know. Even if you've done nothing wrong, being defensive or secretive can lead them to the wrong conclusions, which may end in you losing your Instagram account.
 This lets them feel included and validates their decision to let you on the site. There are a lot of simple, easy ways to do this that don't have to involve allowing them onto your account:


Show them pictures you've taken.
Ask them to help pick a filter every now and then.
Take a "family selfie" with them on vacation or at a cool location.
 If you've shown that you can be responsible with an account for 3-6 months, politely let you parents know that you are making your account public to gain more followers. If you parents find out about these changes before you tell them, they may feel like their trust has been violated and will overreact, potentially cutting your account., Instagram is an extension of your social life, not your entire life, so don't give your parents the impression that all you do is look at your phone. This is not only important for them, but for you. After all, it is hard to take great photos if you are looking at a screen all day.


Effective Instagram accounts post 1-3 pictures a day, not 100.

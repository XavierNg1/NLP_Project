 When the harvest is over, cut them back to about 3 feet (0.9Â m). The first frost will kill them, after which you can trim them back further and cover them with a tarp or other protective cover for the rest of the winter.
 Use a shovel to uncover the rhizomes and trim back the roots on each one. Fertilize the soil around them and mound it loosely into 1-foot hills. Add a layer of mulch and moisten the soil with water until the hop plants sprout once more.

 To do this, open “My Collections,” located on the bottom of the main screen on the right hand side. Click the “Crafting” button located at the top of the screen. This will take you to a menu that you can enchant or disenchant cards from., You can filter the cards in multiple ways. The drop-down menu on the upper left will filter the cards based on the Hero they are associated with. You can also filter the results by clicking the “Filter” button and choose cards based on the mana crystals they cost to play. It is a good idea to look through the different screens before deciding on what card to create or to destroy.

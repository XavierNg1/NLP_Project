 To keep the fat content down on cuts of red meat, remove any fat on the meat before cooking it. Use a sharp knife to trim away any fat on the outside of the meat or between the layers of meat. Do this right before you cook the meat.If you do not like doing this yourself, you can get the butcher to do it for you. Ask the butcher to remove the visible fat on the meat before wrapping it up for you.
 Prepare the meat in healthy ways so you are eating less carcinogens and still getting the vitamins and minerals in the meat. Baking the red meat in the oven or as part of a stew is a healthier option than pan-frying the meat. Broiling or braising the meat in the oven will be less high-heat intensive, meaning there will be a lower fat content in the final dish.For example, you may prepare a stew that contains red meat, such as a beef stew. Or you can make a baked meat casserole.
 Roasting meat, rather than grilling it, will infuse it with flavor without subjecting it to high heat. Grilling meat can also produce carcinogens. Avoid grilling red meat or shorten the grill time by marinating the meat beforehand or roasting it partially before grilling it.You can also stir fry red meat like beef or pork to cut down on the cook time. Make a beef stir fry with vegetables at home for a healthy meat option.
Be careful with marinades if you are on a low-sodium diet. Marinades are often high in sodium.
 Whenever you are cooking red meat, make sure you use vegetable oils like olive oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil, and avocado oil. These oils are vegetable based and are a healthier option than butter or other animal fats. Drizzle olive oil over red meat before roasting or braising it in the oven. Use canola oil or peanut oil to stir fry the meat in a wok or a pan.Make sure you keep your kitchen stocked with these vegetable oils so they are easy to access while you are cooking meat.
If you do pan-fry your meat, try using olive oil or canola oil for a healthier option.

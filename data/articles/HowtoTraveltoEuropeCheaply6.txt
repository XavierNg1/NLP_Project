 There may be a volunteer program available in Europe, which would be a meaningful way to spend at least part of your trip. Some programs can offer meals, transportation, or possibly lodging.


Diverbo has programs in Spain and Germany. In exchange for conversing in English for one week, you can get three-course meals, four-star resorts, and more for free!

, Read the e-book "The Underground Guide to International Volunteering" for information on opportunities you should and should not take. There is even a section in the back of the book that lists dozens of volunteer opportunities in Europe, as well as the rest of the world.
 Kandersteg in Switzerland and ACLE in Italy are two such examples.

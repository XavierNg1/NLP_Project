 If you’re using Android or iOS and can’t find a close button, you’ll need to close the browser tab or window that launched the pop-up. Closing a single tab should not affect other open tabs in your browser.


iOS: Tap the tab icon at the bottom right corner of Safari. When the browser tabs appear, swipe the one that contains the popup ad to the left.
Android: Press the square button at the bottom right corner of the screen, then swipe the tab containing the ad to the left or right.
Mac & Windows browsers: Click the small X on the tab.
,, If you’ve been unable to close the tab, you’ll need to close the whole web browser. You will lose anything you were working on in other tabs, so only do this step if nothing else has helped.


Windows: Press Ctrl+⇧ Shift+Esc, select the web browser, then click “End Task.”
Mac: ⌘ Command+⌥ Option+Esc, select your web browser, then click “Force Quit.”
Android: Press the square button at the bottom right corner of the screen, then swipe all browser windows off the screen.
iPhone: Double-press the home button (if you’re using iPhone 6s, 3D Touch press the left side of the screen), then swipe all instances of the browser off the screen.

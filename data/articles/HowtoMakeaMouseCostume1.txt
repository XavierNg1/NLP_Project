 Draw 2 semicircles that are each about 4-inches (10.16) wide on gray, black, or brown felt (or furry fabric), then cut them out using scissors. These will be the ears., Draw 2 semicircles that are each about 3-inches (7.62 cm) wide on pink felt, then cut them out using scissors. These will be the inner ears., These form the completed mouse ears.
 The costume will look best if the hoodie is the same color as the outer ears.


Make sure that one mouse ear is attached to each side of the hood, and not too high up on it. You can put on the hood and test out the ears before attaching them to decide which exact position looks best.
 This step is optional, but can add a touch more flair if you have time. Lay the hoodie on a flat surface, and cut out an oval of pink felt (or another contrasting color) that is the width and height of the front of the hoodie. Then sew, glue, or pin the oval to the hoodie to serve as the belly.
 Simply put them on once the rest of the costume is finished.
 Take a tube sock that is the same color as the outer mouse ears and the hoodie (or pink).Fill it with newspaper or fiberfill so that it looks like a tail, then sew, glue, or pin it to either the bottom back of the sweatshirt or the back waistband of the sweatpants.


You can cut off one leg of a pair of tights and use it in the same way to make a mouse-tail—just make sure to tie, sew, glue, or pin one end closed before you stuff it.
 You can use regular makeup. Put a dot of pink lipstick on the end of your nose to make the mouse’s nose. Use eyeliner (black, brown, or white) to draw a few whiskers across your cheeks.
 If you would like to complete the mouse look, you can put socks on your feet that match the color of the mouse costume, and socks or mittens on your hands. These will serve as the mouse’s paws. You can use socks or mittens of the same color, or a contrasting one. For instance, if you have a black mouse body, then white paws might look nice.

 Though wiping a leather sofa down with a moist rag will work as part of your regular cleaning routine, every once in a while, you should give it a proper cleaning. Harsh chemicals can damage and discolor the leather, so purchase a product specifically designed for leather upholstery.


If you cannot find such products at the grocery store, try a larger department store like Target or Walmart. You can also buy these products easily online.
 Simply mix equal parts water and white vinegar in a bowl.
 You don’t want to apply the cleaner directly to the surface of the sofa. Instead, you’ll apply it to a rag and use that to apply it to the leather. Wipe the rag over the entire sofa, making sure to work in a grid pattern so you don’t miss anything.


The rag should be damp, but not soaking wet.
 Use a fresh, dry rag to wipe the leather clean of the cleaning product you just applied to the surface.
 Make a solution that’s one part white vinegar and two parts linseed or flax oil. Rub that onto the couch in a grid pattern using another fresh, clean rag.


Let this solution work on the sofa overnight, or for about eight hours.
 After you’ve let the couch condition overnight, rub the sofa down with another fresh, clean rag. This will make the leather healthy and shiny, like new!

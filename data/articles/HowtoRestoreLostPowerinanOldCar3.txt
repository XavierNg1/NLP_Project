If petrol/oil is leaking, this is dangerous as petrol/oil is highly flammable. Furthermore, it is very slippery which could cause loss of control for other vehicles. Not only that, it prevents the fluids from doing their jobs correctly as the leaking fluid cannot reach the engine.
 Air filters get clogged up with dirt (or sometimes leaves) over the years which will restrict the amount of air that can flow into the engine resulting in less fuel being burnt in air making the combustion process harder to take place. Changing the air filter will improve air flow into the engine resulting in a better fuel:air ratio.
 As time goes on, microscopic pieces of metal (from within the engine) end up in the oil which causes extra friction within the engine. This restricts the engine components ability to move. Changing the oil and filter will be less viscous than the oil you took out making the engine much more rev happy.

 Use a jeweler's loupe or a standard microscope. If you don't have access to a high-powered magnification tool of your own, consider asking a friend or a local lab. Otherwise, just visit a jeweler.
 Look for small, microscopic flaws that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye. You should see some small imperfections on a real ruby. Fake and lab-created rubies are almost always flawless, as the natural flaws are so tiny that they are extremely hard to replicate.


If you see bubbles of any kind, then you are likely dealing with a fake ruby. Look for flaws other than bubbles.
External flaws (blemishes) include scratches, pits, nicks, and small scrapes. Internal flaws (inclusions) are categorized as: cracks (feathers) crystals, negative crystals, silk, fingerprints, halos, cavities, chips, and color zoning., The intricacies of the ruby surface will only be readily visible beneath a 10-power microscope. If the ruby is rounded, rolled, or excessively smooth, then it is probably a fake gem. The stone might be the real deal if the facet is clean, pristine, and sharp-cut.

 You will need to cook the corn one ear at a time, but the instructions are the same for each ear.


Do not remove the husk. The corn will cook better in the microwave if left in the husk during the cooking process.
 The microwave should be set on high power or full power.


Let stand in the microwave for 1 to 2 minutes to avoid burning yourself with the steam.
 Cut of the stem end using a sharp kitchen knife.


Use oven mitts or a towel when removing the corn from the microwave.
As you cut, you should also remove the first row of kernels. Make sure to cut through the husk completely.
 Use oven mitts or a towel to grab hold of the corn from the uncut top end. Gently shake the ear, allowing the corn to slip free.


The ear of corn should slip out of the husk easily. Usually, even the silks will remain left behind inside the husks.
You can serve the corn with butter and salt, or however you prefer it.

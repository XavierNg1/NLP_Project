 Start by reaching arms upwards. Gently lean forward and reach towards your toes. This stretches both the hamstrings, leg muscles, and the lower back. For a more advanced version, keep your back completely straight as you lean over. Advanced or more flexible stretchers can reach past feet.


The goal is not actually to reach your toes (or not), but to straighten and lengthen the back. A mistake in form is to be focused on the feet rather than the back. This is a back exercise, not a foot-grabbing game.
Use props to get the form proper. Therabands, rolled up towels and belts can all be used to get into a modified form. This is not cheating; it is using tools to help you stretch.;
, While standing erect, bend forward at the waist and reach towards the ground. Bend forward far enough to feel a comfortable stretch in the back and legs.

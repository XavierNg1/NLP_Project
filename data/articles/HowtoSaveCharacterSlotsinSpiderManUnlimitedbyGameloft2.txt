 Look for the game app on your device. Its name is Spider-Man with the classic Spider-Man on the logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 On the main page, tap the red “My Team” button on the lower left corner. This will bring you to your current Spider-men roster. All your Spider-men’s character cards are displayed on the right side. Scroll up and down to view all of them.
 Tap on the Spider-Man you want to rank up. You can rank up a Spider-Man up to its maximum number of stars. Each rank up increases the number of stars by one.


Common Spider-men can be ranked up until 3 stars, Uncommon until 4 stars, Rare until 5 stars, and Epic until 6 stars.
 Tap the “Rank Up” button found on the bottom. The Rank Up screen will come up. Tap the character slot to add another Spider-Man from your roster. Tap on the one you’d like to fuse for the rank up. You can only use the exact same Spider-Man character for ranking up.


Ranking up is a good strategy to increase your Spider-men’s ranks and reduce the clutter from your roster.
 Once the needed Spider-Man is filled, a “Rank Up” button will appear. Tap on this button to proceed. The main Spider-Man will be ranked up and the other one will be removed from your team roster.
 Go back to My Team and you should be able to see an additional empty character slot, ready to be filled up with a new and better Spider-Man.

 If your child’s eyes bulge outward because of this syndrome, it is important to keep them lubricated. The best way to do this is by using eye drops (which are also called artificial tears). The eye drops will help to keep your child’s eyes from getting scratched. This is important because scratches along the lining of your child’s eyes could potentially lead to vision problems.To use the eyes drops:


Apply the eye drops to your child’s eyes at least four times a day for maximum effect.
Check to see if the solution is temperature sensitive. If it is, keep it in the fridge.
 Mild, non-comedogenic (meaning it doesn’t block pores) cleansers and mild baby shampoos can be used to prevent bacteria from accumulating near your child’s eyes, leading to irritation and infection. It is best to do this at night to wash away any dirt that accumulated during the day.To clean your child’s eyelashes:



Step 1: Make sure your child’s eyes are kept closed, and get them damp. Right after showering is a great time to do this. Make sure that your child’s eyes stay closed. Wash your hands with warm water and soap.

Step 2: Put a pea-sized drop of shampoo on your clean index finger. Gently rub the shampoo along your child’s eyelashes. Give the eyelashes 40 gentle rubs.

Step 3: Rinse off excess shampoo with a washcloth and warm water.
 Because your child’s eyes are more exposed to dirt and bacteria than most other children, it’s important to give him as much protection as possible. Sunglasses are the best protection for outside activities, while normal glasses or even eye goggles can be worn when doing activities inside that could potentially get into your child’s eyes.

 If you are having difficulties in your relationships, it is important to sort these out quickly. Impoverished relationships are a key source of discontentment and if you have tried hard with some people and nothing improves, it is important to reassess whether or not you will continue to have that disruptive influence in your life. For those you love and care about, praise them, acknowledge them, and be more a part of their lives in each and every way daily. Revel in the beauty of loving and caring for people around you. Even those who cause you pain, forgive them as you move on from them, and let them be the way they are in the world without this causing you angst.;

This may seem difficult at first in a world where you are taught to "trust nobody but yourself" but if you cannot even trust yourself, even that adage is twisted. Forget the negative connotations about trust. Be a pragmatic trust-warrior by accepting that there will be some people who will abuse that trust but for every abuser, it is likely there will be 9 people who reciprocate your trust, or who eventually come around because someone cared enough to trust them. Hang onto this belief doggedly and change the world's contentment as well as your own.

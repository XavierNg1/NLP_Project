 When choosing a cage for your rabbit, keep in mind that he will need some room to hop around. Try to choose a cage that is at least 30 inches long by 24 inches wide by 18 inches high.Cages range from simple types to rabbit condo types., Californian rabbits should never be kept outside. You need to keep your rabbit indoors to protect her from predators, bad weather, and loneliness.Even if your rabbit is safe within her cage, the sight of an approaching predator may give your rabbit a heart attack and kill her.
 If the cage you choose for your rabbit does not include a hiding spot, then you will need to place a cardboard box or a wooden nest box for your rabbit to hide inside. Rabbits feel more secure if they have a place to retreat to when someone approaches their cage or just when they are feeling nervous.Rabbits seem to like cardboard boxes because they can move them around, chew on them, and hide in them.
 Pelleted paper bedding is appropriate for rabbits, but you can also use hay if this material is not available. Make sure that you avoid cedar and pine bedding because these materials can cause respiratory and liver problems., Your Californian rabbit will use a small litter box if you provide one for her. Place the litter box in one corner of her cage. Put down a few sheets of newspaper in the litter box and lay hay over the newspaper. Empty the litter box and refill with clean materials daily.If you notice that she is urinating in a different corner of her cage, then just move the litter box to that corner.

 You can ask your florist to do this while making your bouquets, or you can do it yourself with gold ribbon and pins. Wrap the stems of your bouquets in gold to add a little sparkle to your flowers and your look while coming down the aisle.If possible, try to talk to your florist in advance to see what your options are for adding gold to your bouquet wrapping. This saves you the hassle of having to redo things later on.
 Add some gold to your look by adding gold accessories. For brides, this could mean gold necklaces, bracelets, earrings, hair clips and pins, and even sashes or belts around the wedding dress. For grooms, this may mean cufflinks, watches, or belts.


You can opt for genuine gold accessories, or for more affordable novelty and costume jewelry that is gold plated or gold colored.
If you are wearing diamonds, pearls, or other stones, look for jewels in a gold setting.
 Gold shoes can add a bit of gold to the outfit for brides, grooms, bridesmaids, and groomsmen. Gold heels or ballet flats work for the more traditional bridal look, while gold sneakers or high tops work for both men and women at unconventional or casual weddings.Search local shoe stores for your gold shoe options, as well as online marketplaces.
You can also dye white cotton or satin shoes a gold color to match the rest of your decor. Canvas shoes can even be painted gold.

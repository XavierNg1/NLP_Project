 If your itching is caused by sunburn, make sure to apply sunscreen to any exposed skin when going outside.If your skin is particularly sensitive to the sun, avoid sunshine during peak hours. These means anywhere between 10AM and 2PM. Peak hours are based on peaks in UV radiation and not sunlight itself. Therefore, the timeframe remains the same year-round.SPF levels are somewhat deceitful. A sunscreen that has an SPF of 50, for example, is not actually twice as protective as one with an SPF of 25. Choose brands based on what they protect against rather than SPF levels. Look for brands that specifically protect against UVA and UVB rays.These are usually labeled "broad spectrum."
While SPF levels aren't the best measure of a sunscreen's strength, it's important to understand most dermatologists recommend a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or above.
 Dry skin can become itchy easily, so using high quality moisturizers can help reduce the likelihood of skin itch.


High quality moisturizers include Cetaphil, Eucerin, and CeraVe. They can be purchased at most drug stores without prescription.Apply creams once or twice daily, especially when getting out of the shower, after shaving or exercise, or other activities that dry out or irritate skin., Your itching may be caused by exposure to allergens or skin irritants. If you suspect your skin's itchiness is in response to an irritant, limit your exposure.


Common causes of allergic reaction in skin are nickel, jewelry, perfume, skin products with fragrances, cleaning products, and some cosmetics. If itchiness seems to occur in response to a particular product, cease use.Scented laundry detergents are known to cause skin itchiness. Try to buy natural detergents that don't contain added scents.Use mild, unscented soaps, conditioners, and lotions when possible.

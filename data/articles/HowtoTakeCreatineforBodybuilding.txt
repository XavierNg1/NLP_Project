 There is a sea full of information available on the backgrounds of creatine that can be easily accessed over the internet.;
, You can always seek advice from a professional who can tell you what is best and what will suit your needs.
 Don't opt for cheaper brands as you won't be getting the high quality creatine which is important to your physical health. Use the internet to find a brand that other people have reviewed as high quality e.g Optimum Nutrition. Once you choose a brand make a purchase either over the internet or in your local nutrition store. When you have chosen your brand ensure you purchase the same one again so that you aren't mixing different brands.
 Some products state that you should do a creatine 'loading phase' for a certain amount of days so that your body will be 'saturated' with creatine. This is not entirely necessary as your body does not need this phase in order to get to the 'saturated' state. Taking the product 5g-10g a day should be enough for you to benefit from taking it.
 Constantly supplementing with creatine can put stress on the liver and kidneys and can lead to problems. Only take creatine in stages such as 2 months on and 2 months off to give your body a rest from supplementation. Use it particularly when building up to a competition such as a race or heavy powerlifting session.

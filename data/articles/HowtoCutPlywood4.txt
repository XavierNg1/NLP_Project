 If you don't have access to power tools, you'll need to invest in a solid crosscut saw. Look at a saw's TPI, or teeth per inch. A saw with fewer teeth will cut faster, but you'll be left with a rough edge. A saw with a higher TPI will leave you with a smoother edge, but it will take some time to saw.Make sure the handle is comfortable when you grip it, and look down the back of the saw blade to make sure it is straight. The tip of the saw should be flexible. When you bend it, it should snap back to the center., Anytime you are working with wood, make sure to measure your cut. Once the wood has been cut, there is no turning back. Double check your measurements before cutting.
 Start on the edge of the board, and hold the saw blade upright. Draw the saw up a few times to get a notch in the edge of the board.You can use your thumb knuckle to guide the blade, but be careful., When you've made a solid notch in the edge, bring the saw to about 45-30 degrees. Work carefully and use smooth, full strokes to cut plywood.Keep your forearm and shoulder in line with the blade to ensure a straight cut.If you notice the blade running off track, give the handle a little twist to set it right., When you get towards the end of your cut, use your free hand to hold the cutoff end. Turn the saw upright and use short vertical strokes to finish the cut.

 A check cashier is a store whose main purpose is to cash checks for people. Of course, most of them charge a small (and sometimes not-so-small) fee to cash the check so they can stay in business. If possible, call a few in your area first to figure out which one has the lowest fee.These businesses are most often found in low-income areas, as people in those areas are less likely to have bank accounts.;
, Often, you will need to cash your check before you can move ahead with paying bills, though with some prepaid debit cards, you can add your check directly to your account. However, if you want to use something like a money order, you'll need to have cash on hand first., Though in some cases, you may want to use a money order or a prepaid credit card, check cashiers will also sometimes pay bills for you, again for a fee. You just need your account information for bills like your electric or water, including how much you need to pay. The check casher will cash your check and then pay the bill from some of the money.

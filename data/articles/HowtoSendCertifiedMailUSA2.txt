 There are several web businesses that offer USPS Certified Mail delivery. You shouldn't have to pay any monthly fees for an account.


Look at the price for sending Certified Mail. Decide if the price is worth what you will pay for the service.
Make sure that the service offers next-day USPS tracking for your letter.
Check to see that the service provides proof of mailing and USPS proof of delivery.



Write a letter in your word processing program. Print and sign it if needed.
Alternatively, use a form provided by the recipient. Again, print the form and sign it as needed.
 Save the scanned document on your hard drive. Make sure that the document is legible and easy to read.
 The service will then address, print and mail the letter on the same business day.

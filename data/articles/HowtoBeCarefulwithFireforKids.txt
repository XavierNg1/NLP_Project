 When your parents are cooking or lighting a fire, keep away from the area. You can still talk to them across the room or from several steps away but there is no need to be standing next to the heat. Keep a good distance from any fire that is burning and never place objects in a fire.;
, These are not toys. They are for creating a flame to light a fire and you can easily hurt yourself. Take them to your parents if you find them.



Never reach up for a handle on a stove or table. The pot may be filled with boiling water or very hot food and if it falls on your skin or face, you can be very badly burnt. Always ask if you are curious and want to look inside a cooking pot.
Ask your parents to turn the handles of cooking pots towards the centre of the stove.
Always get adult help to cook anything.
 The lamp can overheat and anything put near a candle might catch on fire from the flame.
 The coals are very, very hot and the flames can burn you. If something falls into a fire, ask an adult for help straight away.
 Make sure that they don't go near the stove or a fire source. Teach them about how fire or heat can hurt them.
 Loose nightwear can easily trail into a fire or heater and catch on fire. Close-fitting pajamas are safer.



Never stick your fingers, sticks or any other objects into an electrical socket. This can burn you very badly if the electricity carries out to your body.
Leave electrical cords alone. They can be a cause of fire.
 If it ever happened that your clothes caught on fire, it is important to practice this so that you will do it automatically:


Stop - stop screaming, crying and panicking
Drop - drop to the floor straight away
Roll - roll over and over to try to put out the flames

, If you are asleep or inside your house when a fire starts, there may already be thick, dark smoke when you try to get out. Get down low and crawl to get out. There is usually less smoke at the floor level.

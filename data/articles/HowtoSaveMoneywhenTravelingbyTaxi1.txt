 If you’re at a taxi stand, you can be choosy about the taxi driver you want. Stop by a few cabs and ask the fare to wherever you’re going. If they all give you about the same price, just choose the one with the lowest price. If you get varying rates from the different cab drivers, you should still choose the least expensive cab, but jot down a note to yourself about the taxi companies that charged the unreasonable fares and avoid them in the future.If you know the approximate distance you’re traveling and you’re at a location (like an airport) that regulates prices so that all taxis have to charge the same rate, you won’t need to compare cab prices, since they should all be identical.;
, If you have only large bills on hand, you might get stuck with a taxi driver who can’t make change, and you might be forced to provide an especially generous tip. If you’ve only just been to the bank, stop in a store or at your hotel’s front desk before hailing a cab., There’s often a sense of urgency about disembarking from the cab – you’re stopped at the curbside, and perhaps someone else is waiting to get in. Just play it cool and take a few deep breaths to help you relax, if necessary. Rushing your payment could lead you to accidentally count your cash incorrectly and overpay.Rushing when exiting the cab could also endanger you, as you might step out the wrong side and into oncoming traffic or engage in some equally unsafe practice.
 It is standard practice to tip 10%-15% of the fare to your driver. Do not confuse taxi tipping with, for instance, tipping your waiter, where the appropriate tip is 20% or more.

 Turn the oven on to 375 degrees F (190 C). Select a large baking sheet with rimmed sides. The rimmed sides will keep the kale from sliding off as you transfer the sheet from the oven.


If you don't have a rimmed baking sheet, you could use a large roasting pan. Just take care not to overfill the pan or the kale with steam instead of roast.
 Wash the kale thoroughly to remove all dirt and grit. Pat the kale dry and tear or cut away the thick stems. Chop the kale into large pieces and dry them again with a clean kitchen towel or paper towel.To quickly dry the kale, try spinning it in a salad spinner until all the water is removed from the kale.
 Place the chopped kale pieces in a large mixing bowl. Drizzle the kale with one tablespoon of olive oil, one clove of garlic, and salt and pepper. Toss the seasonings together with the kale so the kale is completely covered. Spread the kale on the baking sheet and bake it for 15 to 20 minutes. You should stir it every five minutes, until the kale is crispy and a bit dark in color.The kale doesn't need to be arranged in a single layer on the baking sheet. As the kale roasts, it will shrink down in size.
 For the crispiest roasted kale, serve the kale right after you've removed it from the oven. Roasted kale works well as part of a cheese spread or crudit√© platter. For example, you could serve the roasted kale alongside pita chips and hummus or a veggie tray.


Roasted kale does not stay crispy for more than a day or two so try to eat the pieces quickly. If you must store them, place them in an airtight container for a few days.

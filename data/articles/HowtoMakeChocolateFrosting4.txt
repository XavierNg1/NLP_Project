 If you cannot consume dairy for any reason, this is a great frosting to use. You'll need:


125g soy or olive spread
500g icing sugar/confectioners sugar
80g cocoa powder
100ml soy, almond or rice milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract or essence.
 Beat with an electric mixer until it turns creamy.


Because the consistency of soy/olive spread is thinner than that of butter or stick margarine, you don't want to over-beat the spread. Doing so could thin it out too severely, causing your frosting to become too runny.
 Add half of the icing or confectioners sugar to the creamed spread. Add 2 tablespoons of the non-dairy milk. Beat again, until the mixture turns light and the volume grows.
 Add the rest of the icing or confectioners sugar, the cocoa powder, the remaining non-dairy milk and the vanilla. Beat more, until well combined. The resulting mixture should have a velvety, creamy texture.Add a bit more non-dairy milk, 2 tsp (10 ml) at a time, if it's a little stiff.
Similarly, add more sugar, 2 tsp (10 ml) at a time, if the frosting seems too thin.
 This frosting is suitable for those pursuing a dairy-free diet.

 Acoustic panels or drywall padding can make the sound produced by drums far less likely to bleed through the room that houses the kit. However, sound insulation is expensive, and often requires a fair amount of work and restructuring of the room itself.Cheaper options for soundproofing your room include sound absorbing strips that can be placed along the ceiling, the bottom of doors, and walls.
If you can't afford acoustic foam, hang blankets or quilts on your walls. The fabric may not be ideal, but will help absorb the sound.
 Further sound insulation to a room requires more exhaustive changes to the structure of the room, such as decoupling the sheetrock from the wall framing. Contact a carpenter (and your landlord) if you plan on making such changes.


Make sure the doors and windows are sealed properly to keep sound from escaping.
Sound-isolated rooms built correctly are airtight, so ventilation is a must for such rooms. Makes sure you look for a ventilation system that doesn’t compromise your sound isolation., Drum screens, also called drum shields, redirect the sounds created by drums. The hinged plastic sheets can be angled to direct the sound exactly where you desire, such as away from your parents' bedroom. Drum screens are useful for practice, but note that the overall sound produced will be different than an open drum.


Remember that these screens redirect sound – often reverberating right back into your ears. Invest in some ear buds to save your hearing when using a shield.
Try coupling the shield with any sound absorbing material you’ve placed in your room. Aim the shield so that the sound is redirected into the material.

 It is best to use smaller craft scissors or scissors for children (not safety scissors).
 Be sure not to touch the sharp side of the blades. Hold the handles of the scissors and open them fully.
 Carefully apply a slight amount of pressure and push the scissor blade halfway into the cork. Be careful not to push the cork into the bottle or break the cork., Hold the bottle tightly with one hand while twisting the handles of the scissors. Alternately, hold the handles of the scissors still and twist the bottle instead. The cork will come out on the scissor blade if you have the blade wedged deep enough or the cork will come out far enough to be pulled out by hand.

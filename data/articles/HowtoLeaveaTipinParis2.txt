 Tipping in Parisian taxis is not required, but is common. If your driver is happy to help with luggage, and accommodates specific questions about places to see or visit, it’s more than sufficient to pay them €1 to €2 more than the fare., Ten percent of the shuttle charge is standard for booked shuttles where the operator helps you with your luggage, such as those that may take you from the airport to your hotel. If a shuttle is free, tip the driver €1 or €2.As a rule of thumb, provide gratuity to anyone who helps with your bags. At the airport, train station, or your hotel, expect to tip anyone who helps unload or carry your luggage. One or two euros per bag is a good amount.
 If you’re staying somewhere for a night, don’t feel like leaving a tip for house cleaning is absolutely necessary. However, it’s worth noting that housekeepers are usually some of the lowest paid workers in the French service industry.If you’re staying multiple nights, it’s more important to leave a tip for housecleaning if they come in and clean up while you are out during the day. Leave a tip at the end of your stay, totaling €1 to €2 per night that you stayed.
 You don’t necessarily need to tip the hotel’s concierge, though you should do so if they help arrange a meal or a show you may not have otherwise been able to enjoy. For example, if there is a restaurant or event that has proven challenging to get into, ask your concierge if they may be able to help.When a concierge’s magic touch does pay off, tip them €10-20, depending on the specific context.

Buy high-top football shoes if you are a lineman, because the high-tops will provide extra support for your ankles. Your constant lateral movements on the field may cause ankle injuries if you wear football shoes with a lower cut.
Buy mid-cut football shoes if you are a skill player such as a quarterback, wide receiver, defensive back or running back, because mid-cuts will allow you to maneuver easier on the field .
Low-cut football shoes can also be worn by skill players, but provide less ankle support than mid-cut shoes. Low-cuts are generally lighter in weight, but provide a higher level of maneuvering flexibility to support quicker movements.;

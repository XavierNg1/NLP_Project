 Take your salt box or grinder and shake it liberally over them. Regular table salt will do—this isn't intended for seasoning. The bugs should go wild with discomfort when you do this.


Salting is optional. Some cooks believe that salting may help clean the crawfish better by compelling them to essentially vomit and purge any mud and waste in their digestive system. However it also increases the risk of killing the crawfish during the purge.
 You want to try to salt the whole batch evenly.
 You can use another bucket or just fill their tub up with a hose. When this happens, the crawfish spit out the grime in their system, minimizing fishy taste and odors and reducing the size of their gritty sand vein.
 The moving water will help wash the mud off the crawfish's shells and gills.
 Try to drain the salt water completely.
 Check for any dead crawfish that float to the top—remove them and throw them away immediately.
 After giving it a stir, the water should be much less grimy than in previous rinses. If you are satisfied with the cleanliness, you are done purging.

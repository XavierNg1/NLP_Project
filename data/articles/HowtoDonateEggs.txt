 Donating your eggs is a very emotional experience for all parties involved, yet is still a legal contract.Be sure you have someone that is looking out for your best interest legally.The legal matters also include your financial compensation. Make arrangements up front with all parties involved to ensure that the financial matters are clearly understood by everyone. The reimbursement for this type of third party reproduction assistance can vary from state to state, so do some research so you are aware of what to expect. Generally, around $8000 is considered a fair rate of compensation.;
, Most egg donations are done in this manner.You will not know the woman receiving your egg donation and she will not know you.Potential recipients will have access to general physical information about you. That information includes a picture of you, your blood type, ethnic family history, height, weight, body type and build, eye color, hair color and texture.In addition to your physical characteristics, potential recipients are given basic personality information about you, such as your level of education, occupation, special interests or hobbies, and your familyâ€™s medical history.Your personal contact information is not shared., Some programs honor any wishes for the donor and recipient to meet in person.All parties involved must agree to the meeting.You may also be provided the opportunity to choose to meet the child that may be conceived and born as a result of your egg donation, once that child reaches an adult age., This is done to improve the odds of maintaining the pregnancy for the recipient.The clinic will use medications to synchronize your cycle with that of the recipient once you have been selected or matched.You may be matched with more than one person for a single donation procedure., Hormone supplements, meaning birth control pills, are given to synchronize your menstrual cycle with that of the recipient.You will take birth control pills for a short time, usually not more than two to three weeks.The doctor in charge of your care will work with both you and the recipient to be sure your cycles match., The initial series of injections are used to interrupt the function of your ovaries.Injectable medications that stimulate your ovaries to produce multiple eggs are given next.One egg is released from the ovaries every month in a normal menstrual cycle. When you donate eggs, hormone injections are given which stimulate the production of more than one egg for that cycle.Harvesting more eggs increases the chances that one will be viable and increases the option to donate to more than one recipient during the same procedure., The calendar or schedule provided will include the exact timing of the injections and schedule of clinic visits.Following the schedule exactly is critical to the success of the egg donation procedure.Some of the injections can be self-administered at home. You, or someone close to you, will be taught how to administer the injections., Ultrasound technology is used to monitor your progress as you move further into the program.Many clinics require short, but daily, appointments to evaluate your progress.The daily appointments usually last for about two weeks.After the two weeks of daily evaluations, you will undergo the procedure to have your eggs retrieved., The actual procedure to donate your eggs usually takes about 30 minutes.You will be put under a mild form of anesthesia so someone will need to be with you to drive you home.The eggs are retrieved through the vagina using ultrasound guided techniques for oocyte aspiration.Most women can resume normal activity the following day., This is referred to as direct donation.The majority of women that participate in direct egg donation are donating an egg to a close friend or family member.The most compelling reason women cite in deciding to donate eggs is a desire to help a woman struggling with infertility.
Having a child is an extremely personal and emotional event. Even if you are working with a close friend or a family member, proceeding with egg donation is a very intense and emotional decision since there is still a possibility of failure.Choose a clinic that you both agree on, and seek legal advice to protect all parties involved before you begin the procedure.One additional area to resolve when working with a close friend or family member is the disclosure of information to the child. Come to terms with this matter before you begin., Some women will place ads on the internet or other forms of media.Take appropriate precautionary steps if you choose to donate to someone you met through an advertisement.It is not recommended that somebody who is poverty-stricken donate because this could be an unfair compulsion for them to do so.
 Talk to someone that knows the laws regarding third party reproduction.The laws are constantly changing in the area of third party reproduction, which includes donating your eggs to another woman. Also seek legal counsel about handling payment arrangements in a manner that protects you.Take care to have a third party involved, such as an informed lawyer, that will look out for your best interest if you choose to work with someone that you met via an advertised need for an egg donor.Select a clinic together that suits your needs and the needs of the recipient. Proceed confidently, but carefully, with legal documents in hand.Have your lawyer arrange the payment in such a manner that protects you from any changes that may be decided by the recipient. Remember, egg donation is not a guaranteed method of conceiving. You deserve to be paid in full even if the recipient is not able to maintain the pregnancy., Universities that offer medical programs often have a third party reproduction program, which includes egg donor programs.If you live in a larger city, especially one with a major medical center, there may be clinics or programs that are easy for your to access.Keep in mind that you will need to be able to keep very frequent appointments, so you should look for a clinic or program that is close to your work, school, or home., The responsibilities of egg donors may vary slightly depending on the agency or program you decide to work with, but most are consistent with recommendations of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine.You are responsible for providing truthful information about your medical history and your activities throughout the process.Follow all instructions exactly as stated by the doctor in charge of your donation procedure.Strictly adhere to the medication schedule provided for you.Do not miss, or be late for, a monitoring appointment.Be sure you have adequate transportation to and from all appointments and procedures.Donate your eggs, also called oocytes, via aspiration as outlined in the agreement.Do not have sex once you have started the medication provided, and for three weeks after the egg donation process has been completed. You can more easily get pregnant during this time.Avoid using any recreational drugs or taking medications other than what has been approved or prescribed by the doctor providing your care during the donation process., The process begins with basic questions and possibly a phone interview to determine your appropriateness for egg donation.Most programs include women that are between the ages of 21 and 34. Some may only include women up to the age of 30.The first steps involve answering basic questions about your background, your personal medical history, and information about the medical history of your family.The next step will involve meeting with a psychologist. Donating eggs can be a very emotional experience. The psychologists will evaluate your mental status and your ability to make an informed decision.The psychologist will want to understand your motivation for donating eggs as well as help you understand possible long-term effects may be relevant to you.Meet with a genetics counselor. Blood tests may be ordered to determine the presence of any genetic links to possible diseases. The presence of genes for some diseases may prevent you from donating your eggs.Part of the genetic and psychological screening will include questions about your personal and family history of mental health conditions that can be passed on genetically.
 The first part of the medical evaluation is similar to a basic gynecological exam.This part will include a pelvic exam, cervical cultures, and blood work to determine the presence of any infectious diseases and to evaluate your current hormone levels., Most women can continue their routine work or school schedule, provided they understand the need to make frequent clinic appointments and adhere strictly to the schedule provided by the clinic.The screening process usually takes about two weeks. The entire process can take as long as four to six weeks, but may vary depending on the length of time between the initial screening and being matched with a recipient., There are several drugs used during the process that manipulates your menstrual cycle.Drugs commonly used during this procedure fall into four categories. The first is regular birth control pills used to regulate your menstrual cycle.The second category is called gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist analogues. This group of drugs suppress the release of eggs from the ovaries, allowing the doctors to control the timing of the development of mature eggs.Follicle stimulating hormone injections come next, given by daily injections. This type of drug is given to encourage multiple eggs to mature.The final agent given is human chorionic gonadotropin. This drug triggers ovulation once the eggs have matured., Understand that your exposure to any given agent is short. While side effects are always possible, women that participate in egg donation most often do not experience caused by the medications given due to the brief exposure.The use of birth control pills may cause a feeling of abdominal pressure and bloating, abdominal pain and swelling, breast tenderness and moodiness. These symptoms usually resolve by the next menstrual cycle following the procedure.Common side effects caused by the second group of medications used, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist analogues,include hot flashes, joint pain, headache, feeling bloated, vaginal dryness, and mood changes.The third class of drugs, follicle stimulating agents, can cause side effects such as abdominal discomfort, bloating, and nausea.The last agent given, human chorionic gonadotropin, can possibly lead to the development of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, or OSSH.While OSSH is a possible complication, it is a rare event, reported to occur between 0.1% and 10% of women participating in egg donor programs.The condition of OSSH can result in fluid accumulation in the chest and abdominal area, and enlargement of the ovaries. In some cases this can cause permanent injury and possibly death., Sometimes women can develop mild skin reactions where the needle from the drug or the lab work has penetrated their skin.


Common problems reported from either the injections or from the lab work done include pain, redness, or bruising at the site of the blood draw or the injection., Most women have little to no discomfort from the actual procedure.The documented risk of serious problems caused by the procedure is rare, about 1 in 1000 women.The most serious complications from the procedure include bleeding that requires observation in a hospital setting, the possible need for a blood transfusion, and possible damage to internal organs.Since the ovaries are located in close proximity to other major organs like the bladder, uterus, bowel, and kidneys, it is possible to cause structural damage to the surrounding areas. This occurs approximately 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 cases.Some research suggests that 1.5% of women that participated in egg donor procedures experienced complications severe enough to warrant hospitalization.The procedure is minimally invasive therefore it also carries a slight risk of infection.You may be give a prescription for a short course of antibiotics to cover the risk of any possible infection from the procedure.Minor discomfort reported by some women usually resolves once the procedure is complete., The physicians at the clinic will have standard protocols in place to monitor your health throughout the procedures and for several weeks following the procedure.


Talk to the doctors at the clinic to better understand how they monitor for possible complications including drug reactions, and how they take care of you should a problem arise.
Be sure you have a written document that clearly states the responsibilities of the clinic in providing care for you should any problems be caused by the medications given or the procedure itself.
 The desire to have your own children in the future is an important consideration.


There is no evidence of an increase in the risk of infertility as a result of being an egg donor.There has also been no evidence to suggest an increase in the risk of developing ovarian cancer that is associated with the drugs and procedures used to donate eggs., Most clinics provide at least one follow-up appointment.In addition to scheduled follow-up appointments, you will be given clear instructions regarding any sudden need for medical attention following the procedure.The follow-up appointments include a medical check-up to be sure you have resumed your normal menstrual cycle, and often includes a session with a psychologist to help answer any remaining questions you may have and to help you provide healthy emotional closure to the procedure of donating eggs., Consult your legal counsel regarding the possible rights of the child in the years to come.The laws regarding third party reproduction assistance, including egg donation, are evolving. The answers regarding your privacy and the rights of the unborn child are not clear.There are no guarantees regarding confidentiality beyond what is agreed upon by you and the recipient at the time of the procedure.The legal rights of the unborn child in situations such as this are being debated. There is no way to know today what the choices of the unborn child will be regarding their potential right to identify those that biologically contributed to their birth.

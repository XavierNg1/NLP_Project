 Both are rates of speed. Something travelling at 1 knot is equal to travelling 1.152 miles per hour., Since 1 knot = 1.152 miles per hour, the formula is 1.152x=y{\displaystyle 1.152x=y}, where x{\displaystyle x} equals the rate in knots, and y{\displaystyle y} equals the rate in miles per hour., Make sure you are substituting for the x{\displaystyle x} value. Multiply to find the number of miles per hour.

For example, if the wind is blowing at 20 knots, you would calculate as follows:1.152(20)=y{\displaystyle 1.152(20)=y}23.04=y{\displaystyle 23.04=y}.So, if the wind blows at 20 knots, it is going about 23 miles per hour.

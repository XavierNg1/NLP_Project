become angry, violent, or depressed when you do not spend time playing video gamesplay in secret and lie to others about how much time you spend playing video gamesnotice that video games have taken over your interest in other hobbies, schoolwork, or your jobconsider playing video games more important than spending time with other people in real life, You should be in control of your emotions; they should not control you. If you feel like your anger in response to video games has taken on a life of its own and you are no longer in control of it, then you should seek help with anger management.

 Choose something with solid, dark lines, so that you can see it through the contact paper when you go to trace it. Even though you will be using clear contact paper, the paper backing will make the design harder to see.This method is suitable for intricate designs and reverse stencils/silhouettes.;
, Tape your design to a flat surface first, then tape your contact paper over that. Trace over the design using a permanent marker.If you are having trouble seeing the design, tape the whole thing over a bright window.


Do not remove the paper backing from the stencil just yet.
 Remove the contact paper from the template, but don't peel the backing away. Place the contact paper onto a cutting mat, then cut out the designs using a sharp craft blade. If you have any inner designs, save those as well., Figure out where you want the design to go first, then gently set the contact paper down. Start at one end, then smooth it down until you reach the other. Make sue that you flatten out any ripples or wrinkles.If you had any cutouts for inner designs, be sure to stick those down as well.
 The cardboard only needs to be a little bit bigger than the stencil. This will keep the paint from soaking through the fabric and staining the back of the shirt.
 Squeeze out some fabric paint onto some sort of palette, then dip a foam brush or a pouncer into it. Gently tap the brush against the stencil; do not drag it past the edges. Avoid using too much paint, otherwise it will loosen the contact paper and leak underneath it.
 As the paint dries, run your hand inside the shirt, between the fabric and the cardboard. This will prevent the paint from sticking to the cardboard as it dries.


Some types of fabric paint need to be heat-set after they dry. Each brand will be a little different, so be sure to read the label on your bottle of paint carefully!

 Make a c-shape with the middle and ring fingers of your right hand.
 Gently rest your thumb on the inner part of the bow frog, allow your other fingers to fall on the bowâ€™s other edge. Loosen up your fingers but keep them together. Your fingers should wrap around the bow in a smooth, yet secure hold.
 Your pinky should rest on the head of the stick.
 Curve your hand around the bow, so you can move it swiftly.

 One of the best ways to inspire students is by giving them good role models. You can start by being a role model yourself. Take care to lead and teach by example.Demonstrate good habits. Show up on time and prepared.
Show enthusiasm. Get excited about the subject you teach, whatever it is. You might say, "Today we're going to perform an amazing chemistry experiment. I can't wait for you to see the results!"

, You can use other people to inspire your class and help them connect with the course material. Try to bring potential role models into your classroom for your students to meet.For example, if you are teaching the history of the Civil Rights movement, try to find someone local with an interesting story to tell. Maybe you could find someone who participated in the Freedom Rides to visit your class.
Invite guest speakers. Consider having a local reporter from the local tv station come talk to your class. Give the students a chance to ask questions.
 Students can also be good role models for one another. Give students a chance to interact with each other. They might be able to inspire each other.Have your class give presentations. Each student could tell the class about their science project. The students will likely be exposed to some interesting new ideas.

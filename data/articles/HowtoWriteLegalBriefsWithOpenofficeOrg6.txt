 A quick way to do this is by clicking on the styles and formatting button, scrolling down to heading 1, right clicking, then choosing modify. This will allow you to save a whole range of paragraph styles for for "heading 1." For me, heading 1 is used for the most basic headings like "statement of facts," "argument," and "conclusion." So the formatting is simply the font I use (Century Schoolbook L), bold, and centered.
 Heading 2 will be your first "point heading." For this, I modify the paragraph style just like above. I go to "indents and spacing." There, I check the single space box and type in the following numbers:


Before text: .49
After text: .40
First line: -.40

,, This is essential, otherwise they will not show up when generating a table of contents.
 You might as well add the headings where the appellate brief index numbering system is too, such as TABLE OF CONTENTS, TABLE OF AUTHORITIES.

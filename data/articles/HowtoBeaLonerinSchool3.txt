 If your teacher puts people in groups, ask them if you can work alone. Generally, loners don’t like to work and interact with other students. If your teacher gives you the option to work together or alone, work alone.


If your teacher won’t allow you to work alone, do your part of the group work, but don’t talk to the other students unless you have to.
 You may prefer to be a loner and not socialize with your peers, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore your classes. One way to successfully be a loner is to focus on your studies and be a good student.Listen in class, take notes, and study so you will make good grades.
It doesn’t make a difference where you sit in class, just as long as you are paying attention.
 Being a loner doesn’t mean that you can’t speak up and participate in class. Raise your hand and ask questions when you have one. If the teacher calls on you or asks a question, answer.Being a loner means you don’t really hang around with other students. It doesn’t mean you don’t participate in class.

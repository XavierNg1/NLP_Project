 Create a building station with plenty of building bricks like Duplo or Legos. Make or buy cardboard bricks and a “wrecking” ball -- this can be any large, soft ball painted black -- for a destruction station. Put small toy trucks in disposable baking trays filled with dirt or sand for a digging station -- be sure to add plastic shovels. Invest in plastic hammers, pieces of foam, and golf tees for a nailing station.For older children, you can use pieces of wood, real nails, and real hammers.
 Get lots of cardboard or recycle old boxes. Cut the cardboard into squares with one foot (30.48 cm) sides and rectangles that are 6 inches (15.24 cm) by one foot (30.48 cm). Make sure you have at least 6 pieces of cardboard per guest so they can make the sides and roof of the house. Buy rolls of construction tape or duct tape that the children can use to connect the cardboard into houses.


You can also get paint for the children to paint the houses.
Create a model house to show the children.
You can also make other sizes and shapes of cardboard.
 Draw or print out a large picture of an cement mixer that’s missing a tire and another picture of a tire. Color the mixer with yellow and black and color the tire black. Hang the picture of the cement mixer on the wall at your child’s height. Put double-sided tape on the back of the tire right before you play. Blindfold each child and have them try to pin the tire on the cement mixer.


Use a bandana for a blindfold.
 Buy several bags of marshmallows and a few boxes of toothpicks. During the party, distribute the marshmallows and toothpicks to the children. Show them how to build using the toothpicks with the marshmallows connecting them. Give them about 15 minutes to see who can build the tallest skyscraper.

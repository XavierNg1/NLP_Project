 These belong to the highest grade of peerage. Address them as "Duke" or "Duchess".After the initial greeting, you may address them the same way or as "Your Grace".


As with any title, you do not need to include the location ("Duke of Mayfair") unless it is necessary to avoid confusion.
If you are making a formal introduction, say "His/Her Grace the Duke/Duchess" followed by the rest of the title.
 In conversation and verbal introductions, avoid reference to all other titles besides Duke or Duchess. Use "Lady" and "Lord" instead, followed by the last name.The following titles are only used in formal or legal correspondence:


Marchioness and Marquis
Countess and Earl
Viscountess and Viscount
Baroness and Baron

, This can get slightly complicated, so look up the exact scenario below:Address the son of a duke or marquess as "Lord" followed by the first name.
Address to the daughter of a duke, marquess, or earl as "Lady" followed by the first name.
If you will be meeting a peer's heir apparent (generally the eldest son), look up his title. He will often use a secondary title of his father's, which is always of a lower rank.
In all other cases, the child has no special title. ("The Hon." is used only in writing.)

, Use the following guide when talking to someone who holds these non-noble distinctions:


Baronet or Knight: "Sir" followed by the first nameBaronetess and Dame: "Dame" followed by the first nameWife of a baronet or knight: "Lady" followed by the first nameHusband of a baronetess or dame: no special title

 At-home sperm tests have been found to be accurate around 95% of the time.Masturbate into the cup the kit provides for you and complete the test exactly as indicated in the instructions. Read the instructions carefully beforehand so you know what to do and what not to do.

Generally, you will collect your sample in a cup, transfer the sample to the testing kit after a specific amount of time, and read the results.You may also have to add another solution to the sample, but this depends on the test.
Tests like these are available at many drug stores and pharmacies.;
, Results should be available in about 10 minutes, though this varies by test. A normal sperm concentration is considered to be above 20 million per milliliter. If your results are lower than that, consult your doctor for a complete infertility workup.Some tests simply tell you whether your count is normal or low. Others may be more exact. This varies by test, so read the instructions carefully.
 At-home tests do not measure other factors that affect fertility. If you are having trouble conceiving, consider seeing a fertility specialist even if your at-home test shows normal results. At-home tests do not check:How much semen you ejaculate at one time (semen volume)
The percent of your sperm that are alive (vitality)
How well your sperm move (motility)
The shape of your sperm (morphology)

 Then pour in Â½ teaspoon (2.46 ml) of bleach. Squeeze the bite valve to allow the solution to flow into the tube and mouthpiece., Then let the solution set for 30 minutes. If the mold infestation is bad, then you may want to let it set for longer, like an hour or even overnight (24 hours). Pour the solution out once it has finished setting., Use a scrub brush to rid the bladder of mold and mold stains. Then remove the tube and use a pipe cleaner-like scrub brush to clean the tube.The bladder may still have some mold stains after cleaning and scrubbing it. This is normal and the bladder should still be safe to use as long as you have cleaned it thoroughly.
 Rinse the bladder at least five times to remove any traces of bleach. Make sure to rinse the tube and mouthpiece as well.
 Make sure to prop open the bladder so it can dry thoroughly. Roll up some paper towels into a ball or use a Q-tip to keep it propped open.

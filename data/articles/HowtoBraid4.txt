 Try to pick them so that the stems are all approximately the same length. You need flowers with sturdy, pliable stems, like dandelions or clover.
 Lightly pinch them together with one hand to hold them in place.
 Use the other hand to gently separate the three stems, so you have a right stem, a middle stem, and a left stem.
 Keep handling the stems gently, and cross the right stem over the middle so that the right has now become the middle.
 Now the left stem has become the middle stem.
 Cross the right over the middle, then the left over the middle. Don't pull too hard, or the stems may break.
 Once you've run out of stem to weave, secure the three ends together by tying a knot, if possible, or using a bit of string instead if you want to make sure not to break the stems.

 Boil the water on the stove for a minute or two or until it is steaming vigorously. Then remove the pot from the heat.Place the hot pot on a heat resistant mat on a table.
Keep any children away from the pot while it is boiling and while it is steaming. Try to do a steaming treatment when there aren't any children around.;
, Drape a large, clean cotton towel over your head and then place your head over the steaming pot.


Close your eyes and keep your face at least 12 inches away from the water. You want the heat to enter your nose and throat, but you certainly donâ€™t want to damage or burn yourself.
 Inhale through your nose and out through your mouth for five counts. Then reduce the inhales and exhales to two counts.Repeat for 10 minutes or for as long as the water is still steaming.
Try to blow your nose during and after the treatment.
 You can give yourself a steam every two hours or as often as your schedule permits.
 If you're busy and not able to boil a pot of water and sit over it, consider placing your face over the steam coming from a hot tea or bowl of soup when you're at work or out and about. The goal and effect is still the same, even if the source of steam is different!A humidifier can also be utilized for this method of relieving the sinuses.

 You might want to do this through a free service, or pay for your own space free from advertising. Registering a domain name is a cheap and easy way to make your site stand out.;
, Beginning with basic statistics is a simple and easy first step. For example, if youâ€™re starting a fansite about a musician, do some research and find out their date of birth, hometown and discography. For a fansite about a film, why not list production credits and box office earnings?

, There are many good sites which offer free layouts, or you may prefer to make one yourself or ask a friend.
 Begin including more in-depth information for interested visitors. Think about what you would like to see in a good fansite. Things like image galleries, plot synopses and character profiles make for interesting reading for fans of your chosen subject.
 For a film fansite, this might include reviews, or fan art and fan fiction for anime and manga.
 Include a place for your visitors to express their opinion on the site or the subject, give them an email address to submit their own fan art and fan fiction, or run a popularity poll.
 Make a list of good fansites dedicated to the same subject as your site. Contact the administrators of these sites and request a link exchange, whereby you both post links to each other on your respective sites. This benefits both parties with increased visitor traffic.
, A static fansite can become outdated and disappointing.

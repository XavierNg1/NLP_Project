 A small amount of membrane is acceptable, especially if the skin is only being dried until it can be tanned. Don't cut holes in the skin to get that last little bit of membrane. It will dry just like the skin, and can be scraped off after drying if necessary.;
, This is easiest if the skin is still very moist; as it dries, it will have a tendency to curl at the edges. This is another reason not to piddle with getting every little piece of flesh removed from the skin. If small holes near the edges of the skin not objectionable, it may help to staple the skin to the board in a few places now. Concentrate on getting the edges of the skin as naturally straight as possible and the skin in the position you will want it to be in once dry.
At the end of the skin where the rattle is attached, if there is one, the skin can be particularly troublesome. A staple in the very corner on each side of the tail can save a lot of trouble.
 This is to cause the muscle to dry rapidly, preventing spoilage. If the subject is not a rattlesnake, skip this step.
, Keep in mind that anywhere the skin can curl, especially around the edges, it will curl. Don't hesitate to pull staples in order to get the screen absolutely as flat and tight as possible. It sometimes helps to take a narrow, flat board and use it to flatten out the bumps in the screen toward the edges of the skin. Of particular concern is the thin tail skin, which can curl in a very narrow space.
 This usually takes 1-3 days for most skins in a dry climate. High humidity may increase this drying time.
 It should be stiff and fully dry. Remember that a merely dried skin can be as easy to tear as paper. If the skin is stuck to the board, carefully slide something thin (such as a long knife blade) under it to free it.

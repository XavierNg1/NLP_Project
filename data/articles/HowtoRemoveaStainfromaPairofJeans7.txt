 Turn your jeans inside out, and just flush out the spot from behind. Simply apply tepid water to the stain with a clean rag/cloth until the stain disappears.


If this step wasn't enough to make your stain disappear, try one or more of the following steps below.
 For old and deep-set stains, put your jeans in a plastic tub filled with warm water. Put some shampoo on a sponge, and scrub the stain vigorously while it's soaking in water. Repeat until the spot is gone.
 Pour a cup of white vinegar to your laundry cycle, and run your wash. Adding white vinegar to your laundry acts similarly to bleach, but it's less aggressive.


Note: this trick is only meant for white jeans.
 If the stain is fresh, and most importantly, not from completely liquid dirt you might be able to lightly brush the dirt of your jeans fabric. But be careful as rough brushing might help the dirt penetrate into the jeans.

 Also referred to as the Destiny Number, the Expression Number highlights the personal gifts and shortcomings you brought into this world. If your Life Path reveals the road on which you walk, the Expression Number reveals the flavor and character of your steps. Considered from the perspective of reincarnation, your Life Path Number is akin to the lesson you must learn this lifetime. Connected to this, your Expression Number reflects the core being - including your personal history from any past lifetimes - that you brought with you to Earth. The name is used because it represents the inborn character of the self as well as that which was passed down to you at birth.
 Similar to calculating your Life Path Number, we reduce the number values of each name individually before combining the results. This honors the individual character your name's (and self's) different facets before uncovering their combined meaning.

, As an example, we'll take the name Robert Nesta Marley.


ROBERT = 9+6+2+5+9+2 = 33 = 3+3 = 6

NESTA = 5+5+1+2+1 = 14 = 1+4 = 5

MARLEY = 4+1+9+3+5+7 = 29 = 2+9 = 11

And finally adding them together we get 6+5+11 = 22 Since we end with a Master Number there is no need to reduce. And so Bob Marley has an Expression Number of 22.

 There are two ways you can do so:


Victory by resignation. This is when your opponent resigns from the game (usually when you force him/her to resign because he/she does not feel able to win the game anymore).






Victory by elimination. This is when you destroy all your opponents' units and most buildings. You automatically win when the game determines that there is no way for your opponent to win.

, You will need lots of resources later on in the game, and most sources will be depleted by then.
 Since your town center is the only thing that can produce settlers, you need to put them in locations that offer good defence.


In the New England map, there are lots of stone barriers, which can be helpful in protecting your town center.






Clumps of trees are particularly good not only because it is hidden, but units cannot move through thick woods.
 This will offer you many more units, buildings, and shipments from home. They can even send you upgrades.
 These can offer valuable things that you can not get in the game such as forts and factories. You need to wait to get a shipment, so use them wisely.
 Some offer better units than other. Generally, the Spanish is easiest and Ottoman is the hardest.

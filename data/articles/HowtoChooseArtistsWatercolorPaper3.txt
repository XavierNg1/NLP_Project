 How thick the paper is is the next thing to consider. The weight of paper is given in pounds (or grams per square metre). The higher the number, the heavier the paper.


The most commonly-used weight is 140lb (300gsm) because it works well for most artists' purposes. If you plan to work very large or use a lot of heavy washes, there are much heavier papers available; 300lb (620gsm) is also popular.






Watercolor papers as light as 90lb (200g) are available, and they are usually less expensive than 140lb. However, they often end up causing problems for beginners because they buckle once you start applying washes. Unless you know how to stretch watercolor paper, they are best avoided.

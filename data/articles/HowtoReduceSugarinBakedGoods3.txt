 Whenever a recipe calls for chocolate (or cocoa), use cacao instead. This is the rawest form of chocolate, so opt for this instead of a more refined “cocoa” product, which will most likely contain added sugars. Cacao can be purchased in such form as as:Nibs or chips
Butter
Powder
Paste

, Say you’ve tinkered with reducing sugar from your favorite cake recipe, but found you couldn’t cut as much out as you hoped before it start affecting the texture and moisture. In that case, compensate by eliminating as much sugar as you can from your icing or frosting. Do this by using:Less sugar than the recipe calls for in your topping. Unlike baking, this should only affect its taste.
Sugar-free substitutes to make your topping just as sweet as you like with fewer calories.
Using alternate toppings for added flavor, like cream cheese, cacao powder, and cinnamon.
 Again, if your experiments still result in more sugar than desired, compensate by being picky about which flour you use with it. Expect refined flours to cause blood sugar levels to spike once they’re digested. Since the sugar in your recipe will likely do the same, minimize the effect by using wholemeal flour instead.The issue with flour isn’t the amount of sugar in it, because there isn’t any. Instead, the issue is how long it takes to digest.
Wholemeal flour takes longer to digest than refined flour, which can help reduce the “sugar-high” sensation after you feel after eating.

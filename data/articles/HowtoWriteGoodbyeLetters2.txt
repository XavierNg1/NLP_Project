 It's goodbye, after all. Why make it any more complicated than it is. Does your boss really need an exposé of all he did wrong—or right? Does your ex-to-be really need to know how you feel about that thing they did that drove you crazy? Nope.
 Avoid being to friendly or informal, and don't air your laundry here. Just be factual, direct, and professional. If there are issues, the boss already knows what they are. If the boss is clueless, this is not the time to educate them.


"Dear Mr. Flitt, I am resigning my position at FlittWidgets effective immediately. You can reach me at the address on file should that be necessary. Sincerely, David Gonaway."

, It's ok to be friendly here—you're probably talking to somebody you get along with. (Would you bother writing to the coworker you didn't get along with? Probably not).


"Bill, you were a blast to work with—we made a great team! Hope old Flitt promotes you into my spot. If you need to talk about things, you have my number. Give me a call. Best, Dave."

, Be respectful, be caring, but avoid terms of endearment. They'll either come off as disingenuous, or worse, cynical. End it how you want them to remember you.


Hi, Stephanie. I really enjoyed our time together, but it's time for us to move on. I wish you all the best, and I know you'll meet somebody who appreciates your deadly snake collection. Yours, Dave"

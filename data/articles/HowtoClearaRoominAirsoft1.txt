 The last thing you want to do is get shot first thing, so be sure to do this and get ready to back away quickly!

, Consider hand signal systems so you don't give yourself away. Give your second man a room clearing sign and he will throw in a flashbang if he has one. If not, your last man will simply open the door in the best way possible. As your team rushes in, he will come to the back of the line. From here your strategy depends on the number of men in your squad.

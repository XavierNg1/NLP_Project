 As long as you wash them after use, you can reuse plugs made from silicone, plastic, or rubber multiple times. However, you'll first need to figure out your size. Reusable plastic ear plugs are sometimes marketed as "one size fits all" while some come in sizes ranging from small to large. You can try a "one size fits all" to start, but may have to do some trial and error before you find the right size for your ears.


You may need different sized plugs for each ear. This is not uncommon, so don't be surprised if you have to buy two different types of plugs.
It may be a good idea to buy a few packs of plugs in different sizes and see what works for your ears.
 Before attempting to insert a reusable ear plug, read the instructions that came with your package thoroughly. How you insert reusable ear plugs varies depending on the precise shape of your plugs. For the most part, the process of inserting a reusable plug is very similar; however, it's a good idea to review your instructions for any special considerations regarding your specific type of plug., Reach over your head with one hand. Grab the top of your ear and pull up and back.This will pull your ear open a bit more, which makes the plug easier to insert.
 Once you've expanded your ear drum, insert the ear plug using a gentle, rocking motion. Rock the plug back and forth to slowly push it into the canal. Keep going until you've sealed off the ear canal.








Make sure you do not push the plug in too far. Most of the plug should be in the canal, but you should still be able to easily grab the plug with your fingertips when you need to remove it.
If you can still hear well with the plug in place, you may have inserted it incorrectly. Refer to the instructions manual and try again. If the plug still does not work after a second attempt, you may need a different size plug.

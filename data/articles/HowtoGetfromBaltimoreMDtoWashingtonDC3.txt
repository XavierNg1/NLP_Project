 Use your GPS or online map generator to plan ahead. Enter your starting address and destination. Budget at least an hour if the roads aren’t congested. Traffic jams could add several minutes or hours to your trip. Choose one of three routes for your trip:


I-95 and I-495 (the Washington Beltway) are common routes but are usually very congested, especially during rush hour.
The Baltimore-Washington Parkway might be less congested because trucks can’t use it, but it has fewer lanes than I-95 and the Beltway.
U.S. Highway 29 (also known as Colesville Rd. and Columbia Pike) is another popular alterative to I-95 and the Beltway. It consists of three lanes in each direction. Overall, it is the least congested route between the two cities., Most highways are very congested during rush hour, so avoid it at all costs. Rush hour between Baltimore and DC occurs Monday through Friday from 6:00 to 10:00 AM and 4:00 to 7:00 PM.To avoid getting stuck in traffic, tune in to WTOP 103.5 FM for traffic updates every 10 minutes., The Baltimore and Washington, DC areas offer carpool lanes (aka High Occupancy Vehicle, or HOV lanes) in select locations. To use the HOV lane, you must have at least one other person in the vehicle with you. Look for the white diamond painted on the road or the sign reading “HOV” or “Carpools and Vanpools.”The I-95 and the Beltway have HOV lanes, which are often less congested than other lanes.

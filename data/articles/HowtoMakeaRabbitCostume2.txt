Cut out a piece of cardboard in the shape of a circle. The circle should be the breadth you'd like the tail to be.
Glue a Velcro backing on one side of the circle. Attach the other side of the backing to the tail end of the leotard. You can either sew or glue it in place.
Stick a bunch of cotton balls on the other side of the circle. Stick as many as will fit and look good, aiming for a nice bulge to make it seem more realistic.



Find a suitable headband. Wrap the band in wide ribbon in a color that matches the outfit, or in white.
Fashion ears from pipe cleaners, wrapping the pipe cleaners around the headband to keep them in place and shaping the cleaners as they extend upward like bunny ears. These are only the holders for the ear shapes, which you'll make next.
Cut out bunny ear shapes from white cardboard. Cut four ears, two for the front and two for the back.
Tape, staple or glue the ears either side of the pipe cleaner ear holders that you've already added to the headband.
Use a marker to draw "inner" ears on the front side of the ears. Alternatively, cut the inner ears from pink cardboard and glue or tape in place.
 Draw on the child's face using face paint. Don't forget the whiskers.
 This might be a toy carrot, a real carrot or a carrot cut out of cardboard.

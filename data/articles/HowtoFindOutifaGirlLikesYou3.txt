 The simplest way to find out if she likes you is to ask her out on a romantic date. Make sure she understands that this date goes beyond just being friends. For example, a dinner and a movie will seem more serious and romantic than grabbing lunch together.
 You need to tell her how you feel if you expect her to tell you how she feels. If you think she may not understand where you are coming from when you ask her out on a date, try telling her how you feel first. Explain that you have romantic feelings for her and tell her the reasons why. Once you’re finished, you should ask her how she feels.


If she says no that’s okay. Don’t take it personally. It may hurt your feelings but at least you went for it. That requires a lot more bravery than most people can muster.
 Letters are pretty neat. Everyone likes getting a letter. If you don’t want to talk to her in person, write her a letter telling her your feelings

, This is sort of a childish way to figure out if a girl likes you, but it may work. If her friends know the girl likes you and that she is waiting for you to ask her out on a date they may be inclined to tell you.


If the girl wants to keep it a secret she may tell her friends to stay quiet. Take what her friends say with a grain of salt.

 Once rolling, cover your pot and reduce to a simmer. Keep it simmering for at least an hour, but 2 or 3 would be preferable. The more time the flavors get to soak in, the more intense and flavorful your dish will be.;
, If you're using a deboned chicken, yay! Skip this part. If not, let the broth continue to simmer and reduce as you're deboning.


If you don't need to debone, don't worry about the extra time you're not spending. It'll all come out in the wash. If it needs a few minutes at the end, you'll give it a few minutes at the end. No harm, no foul.
 You can either bust out a new pot or put all the contents into a different pot (don't throw them away!) and ladle 6 cups back in. Either way, combine 6 cups of the broth with the rice, chicken, remaining salt, pepper and parsley. Cover and simmer the contents for 15 more minutes.
 Cover and simmer again for 5 minutes. Right now you're easing your way into the right liquid to solid ratio and giving your rice time to reach the perfect level of doneness.
 You'll be able to tell how much broth is right -- you want it all to be juicy but not runny. If you overpour a bit, simmer for a bit longer. But you'll need to check to make sure your chicken isn't overcooking.


Salt and pepper to taste. And add any other spices you think would work, too. The basic flavors of chicken and rice can easily gel with many spices.

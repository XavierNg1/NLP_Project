 While you are abroad it may be a good idea to find some income by doing work online. There are many jobs these days that you can do from anywhere, as long as you have an internet connection. With an online job you can both make money while abroad and you can usually create your own schedule, which works well with a student's schedule.Some jobs that can be done online exclusively include writing, graphic design, virtual assistant, and creating your own online business.
In order to find an online job you should do an online search for jobs in your desired field. Try going to websites that are specifically designed to list part-time and flexible jobs., If you are planning on studying abroad you may be able to work at the school you are going to. This could include working for the actual school as a tutor or working under the table as a tutor for other students who need some assistance.In many cases, there will be people in the community that you are moving into that may be interested in getting English tutoring or lessons.
 When studying abroad, you may need to rely on others to help you financially. This could be in the form of fundraising from family and friends, or going to organizations or individuals in your community that would want to invest in your particular study program or schooling outcome. One way to let others know that you need their financial help and what you will use any funds they give you for is to create an online fundraising campaign. With an online fundraising campaign you can make a video that will outline why you are studying abroad and why you think others should support you financially.
If you are doing a study abroad program with a clear educational or job goal at the end of it, you may be able to find an organization or individual that is willing to invest in your future. For example, your local chamber of commerce or city hall may be willing to invest in your future if you have been an active part of your community.

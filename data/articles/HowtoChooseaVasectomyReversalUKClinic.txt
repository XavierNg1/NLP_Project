 You are looking for a surgeon who performs this detailed, specialist surgery on a very regular basis. A few operations a year does not mean that they are a specialist compared to someone who is performing many vasectomy reversals each week. Frequency and experience count.;
, Is he a fully qualified surgeon with surgical qualifications? Is he sited on the General Medical Council's specialist register? If not, then he/she is not a qualified surgeon.
 A specialist surgeon should have a dedicated website to vasectomy reversals. If there aren't any testimonials, ask yourself why aren't there? There should also an indication of whether the testimonials are up to date and there should be many of them. A good surgeon generates spontaneous testimonials. You are really looking at recommendations when you look at the testimonials so they are extremely valuable information.
 The cost is important. When cost is discussed it should be clear about what the price includes. Use this to compare to other clinics. You should find that prices are quite similar for surgeons who perform large numbers of vasectomy reversals.
 The waiting time should not be too long. You do not want to have to wait for an age once you have made the decision to have this procedure.
 If the testimonials are reporting them, then that is more proof that the surgeon is skilled at performing the vasectomy reversals.
 The success rate will never be 100% as a significant percentage of men do develop antibodies against their own sperm and it is not possible to identify these individuals. The success rate stipulated by a clinic, whilst important should not be held as a deciding factor, necessarily. What is the most important aspect of choice is "other people's experiences" before you. Do take note of those testimonials.
 The surgery can only be performed using a microscope. It might be tempting to go for a cheaper option whereby a microscope is not always used but this would be foolhardy to do so. The surgery involves stitching minute stitches into minute anatomy so it really cannot be done adequately without a microscope.
 The technique that matters is the one that works. This is why testimonials, and feedback from other sources speak volumes for the surgeon concerned. There is no gold standard or superior method: scientific research has found no difference between success rates and method but instead, science totally supports that the surgeon's skill is the key factor to look for.
 The answer you are looking for is that they should both be rejoined in one operation. Surgical skills of a qualified surgeon mean that you have a very high chance of both sides being rejoined. If the answer isn't on the website, then ask them.

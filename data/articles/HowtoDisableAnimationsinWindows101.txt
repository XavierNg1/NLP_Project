 Not all animations you see while using your computer will be disabled. For example, animations on websites you visit will not be affected. Also, classic desktop applications (programs) that have animations (which is rare) will continue to play.


Although most websites and desktop programs do not allow animations to be turned off, you can check the site/program's "Settings/Preferences/Options" page to see if there's any setting that allows animations to be turned off.
The option (if it exists) will most likely be under the name "visual effects", "animations", or "motion".

 An in-kind donation offers services or goods instead of money. Making an in-kind donation is usually the result of a nonprofit organization soliciting you or a representative of your business in an effort to secure donations of services or materials.For instance, if an organization needs art supplies and you run an art supply store, they might ask for donations of art supplies.
If you run a massage parlor, you might be able to offer a free massage day for homeless individuals in partnership with a homeless shelter.
 After making your donation to charity, you can take a deduction on your taxes equal in amount to the value of your donation. Retain all receipts, transaction numbers, dates of donation, and the exact amount of your donations. If you made an in-kind donation, retain a record of the value of the services or materials you provided. Tax laws vary by state and municipality. Talk to your accountant for information on how to report your charitable giving deduction.The IRS provides links to relevant documentation regarding charitable donations at https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc506.html.

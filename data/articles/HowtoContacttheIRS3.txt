 There are two ways to find an office:


Enter your zip code and a radius to search in the Office Locator. You will be provided with a list of nearby locations, including their address, phone number, hours of operation and services provided at the location.
Click your state on the map on the TAC contact page. You will be provided with a list of locations in your state, including their address, phone number, hours of operation and services provided at the location.
 This means they will be closed on federal holidays, and there may be restrictions on what you can carry into the building (for example cell phones with cameras are sometimes prohibited).
 Most TACs operate on a first-come, first-served basis, but some now schedule appointments.

 Choose a shirt in a bright color, such as coral or teal, or a pastel shade. This look will show off your upper body as well as part of your calves. Wear low-heeled sandals, flat sandals, or flats, and keep your accessories light.
 Choose a blouse with a light floral pattern to give your style an added boost of femininity. Match this outfit with a low-heeled strappy sandal and simple jewelry, like a pendant necklace or silver bangles.
 This will make for a fun and beach-or-boardwalk-ready look. Wear pants that stop at the knee to flaunt your calves. This casual look works best with a simple pair of flat sandals.
 Wear a form-fitting cotton black tube top with some black closed-toe shoes and you'll create a sexy and elegant look. Wear a short subtle silver necklace to draw more attention to your neckline.
 Wear a black lacy tank with strappy heels and you'll dress up your ordinary capri pants. You don't need to accessorize too much with a lacy top, though black studs can dress up your ears a bit.

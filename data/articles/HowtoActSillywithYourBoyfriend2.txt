 If he's ticklish and likes to be tickled, tickle him often and keep finding new ticklish spots. Try tickling his tummy, sides, ribs, etc. Stroke his feet with your fingernails.
 If you’re on the floor, grab his leg(s) and attempt to drag him somewhere. Or, wrestle him (gently) to the ground yelling, “You’ll never take me alive!!”

, Sink your teeth into his shoulder and act like a crazed Chihuahua wrestling a large chew toy. Make growling sounds. Or, nibble on his ears or eyebrows. (Some guys find this extremely ticklish and will squirm.)

, (Ex. Puddin’ Pop, Smoochy Pear, Mr. Biggles, etc.) Talk to him like he's your "darling wittle sweetheart", and cover his face with smoochy kisses, especially on his cheeks. Be sure he knows you're kidding and that this isn’t going to be a permanent lifestyle change.
 Be sure that his knees aren’t bent at the time or he will collapse. (In fact, just be ready for the possibility that you’ll both end up in a pile on the floor.)

, “You ate TWO bananas? By YOURSELF?? And you’re sure you didn’t drop one?”

, Make it clear you're playing, though, so he doesn't think he's coming on too strong. (Only do this if you kiss often and are comfortable with each other; if your relationship is still in its early stages, you might make him self-conscious.)

, Only do this every once in a while or it will, by definition, stop being random. If you’re snuggling and he does something you like (petting your hair, stroking your cheek, etc.), purr and pretend to be a cat. Or, stare at him. Just stare. Then when he finally says, "What?" stare more, inch closer, and whisper something completely unrelated, then give him a kiss.

 If you have cracks that have started to bleed, you'll need to treat them the same way you would any other cut so you can prevent them from getting infected. Wash the cracks with soapy water, dry them with a clean towel, and apply bandages to protect the cracks and give them time to heal. Change the bandages every so often until the cracks heal.You might want to use an antibacterial salve to help the cracks heal more quickly and keep them moist.
If the bleeding won't stop, or if the cracks seem to be infected, see a doctor for further treatment.
 If you have very deep cracks that aren't bleeding, you can help them heal by trimming away the dead skin on the sides of the cracks. When you wash your hands, soapy water could be getting into the cracks and preventing the skin from healing over properly. Use a clean pair of cuticle trimmers to trim away the dead skin on either side of the cracks to create a more even surface, so water stops getting trapped in there.


After trimming the cracks, apply cream and bandage them to help them heal.
Be very careful not to trim too much. Don't cut deep enough to cause pain or bleeding.
 If you have very persistent or severe cracked skin, you could have an underlying condition that won't go away on its own, like eczema, psoriasis, or a fungal infection. A dermatologist might prescribe medication or give you advice on how to remedy the condition.

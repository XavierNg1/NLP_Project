When you are singing your chin should be parallel to the floor, your chest should be slightly raised, and your abdomen should be flat and firm.Your feet should be slightly apart with your knees slightly bent and never locked in place.
 When you are breathing for singing, your shoulders should be relaxed. This will help to ensure that you take deep abdominal breaths, rather than shallow breaths. Avoid raising your shoulders while you breath in. Instead, keep your shoulders down and relaxed., While singing, you do not want to strain or put pressure on your vocal cords by tensing the surrounding muscles. This can make it much more difficult to sing and will put additional strain on your voice.

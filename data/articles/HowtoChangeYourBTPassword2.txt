 On your computer, open a browser and go to https://register.btinternet.com/cgi-bin/chpasswdsso. This is the web page where you can send a request to BT for a password change.
 This will take you to the “Reset your password” page.
 On the “Reset your password” page, type in the e-mail address of your account and click on the “Next” button.
 On the next page, you will be required to answer your security question. Security questions are set during the account creation. This is important for proving your identity as the owner of the account if you forget your password.


Type in your answer for the security question on the text field provided and click on “Next” to proceed.
 Confirm your password reset request and enter an alternate e-mail address.
 BT will send a temporary password to this e-mail account, which you can use to change your password.
 Go back to https://register.btinternet.com/cgi-bin/chpasswdsso and use the temporary password to change to a new one (refer to method 1).

 To shape the top knot (hair on the head), comb the hair down over the eyes and take your curve scissor and cut the hair till you see the eyes then from the corner of the eye to outer ear cut the hanging hair off and blend it into the top of the ear and shape the hair to round it off and blend it in to the back of the neck.Use the rounded scissors to shape the top palm into the desired height, length, and overall look.
 To shape the palms, this should be the last part to be done. You should have four legs with hair at the top of the foot to the big joint were the dog would bend its foot and shave the hair off the foot to where the foot is clean.To start the palms, you want to comb the hair down and make your first cut to where you shaved the top of the foot to the line where you stopped. Use your curved scissors and scissor the palm to the back so the hair doesn't lay on the ground. Do the same on the top of the palm and do the same thing to the other three palms.
Now you should four round balls of hair just above your dog’s paws on a standard poodle the palms should be the size of a grapefruit the palm would be smaller depending on the dog.
 For the Palm Springs cut, the poodle’s tail should have pom on it. You can determine how fluffy you want the pom to be, but you need one. Use the clippers to shave up from the base of the tail where you already shaved. The pom should get bigger at the tip of the tail and be shaved closer toward the base.


Be sure to use the clippers to taper the hair so that the pom can get slightly larger at the end of the tail.

 Prepare them either in the microwave or over the stove top.


Microwave: Combine them with 2 tablespoons of water in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat the edamame on "high" for about 6 to 8 minutes. Shock them in an ice water bowl for a few minutes and completely drain.
Stove top: Combine them with about 1/2 cup of water in a small pot. Heat the edamame over a medium high heat for about 5 to 7 minutes. Shock them in an ice water bowl for a few minutes and completely drain.;
, Allow the edamame to completely cool to the touch. Add all the salad ingredients together in a medium bowl.
 Mix the wasabi, salad dressing, and soy sauce together in a small bowl.
 Drizzle the salad dressing over the edamame salad. Toss the ingredients, so everything coats thoroughly.

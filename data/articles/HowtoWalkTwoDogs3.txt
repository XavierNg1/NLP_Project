 Do this in low-distraction areas.If one or both dogs appear distracted you should try more practice with them individually.
You can also try having a second walker more gradually introduce the second dog by walking the other pet in parallel on their own leash. Gradually bring the dogs closer until only one person is holding both leashes.
 This is usually fine once both dogs are trained.With loose leash techniques the dogs can sniff and explore a bit.
Use heel commands to avoid major distractions such as another dog or traffic.
 Continue to use the loose leash and heel techniques until the dogs become accustomed to it. But don't forget to rest them and let the pets enjoy the walk.Find shady spots, dog welcoming parks, water spots, and the like where your dogs can rest and explore under your supervision.
With two dogs under your care it will take more effort to watch that they don't get into trouble with other animals or people.
You will need to take extra care watching that the two of them don't tear up the landscape such as digging holes, tearing through fences, or jumping in public water features.
 Keep water and treats with you for both dogs.Water is necessary for the walk, but also keep some treats with you to reward the dogs for good leash behavior and obeying commands.
Make sure you're rewarding both dogs equally.
 When returning home you want to reward the dogs for a good effort.Have enough food and water for both pets in separate bowls for each.
Even though the bowls are separate you can have the eating area in the same room.
This is also a good time to give the dogs a break from the leash.

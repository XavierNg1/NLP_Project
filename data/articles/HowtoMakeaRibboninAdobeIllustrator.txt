 Go to File > New (or Ctrl + N), and set the size of the document to a horizontal letter-sized canvas. Add guides by creating a rectangle using the rectangle tool (W:11in, H:8.5in). Then drag the guides onto each center of the bounding box. Finish by right clicking over your ruler to change your document measurements to pixels.;
, Place the rounded rectangle in the center of the canvas using the guides you just placed. Make sure the shape’s fill is white and its stroke is black.


In order to specify the rectangle's measurements, click on the rounded rectangle tool and then click your pointer on to your canvas. And then input your rectangle's measurements.
 Shape the rounded rectangle exactly the same as the shape on the illustration by using the two anchor points. This shape will also be the center or the knot on the ribbon.
 Start from the center using the guides to show you the center of the canvas. Then shape a heart for one of the bows on the ribbon.
 Do this by selecting the object > right click > transform > reflect. And finally, you need to click on vertical and copy.
 To do this, you need to select the bows > right click > arrange > send backward. You now have a half-finished ribbon.
 Create a triangle by using the pen tool and placing it at the center of the image. Then add an anchor point at the middle of its end so that you can create its inside corner.
, Create the teardrop by using the pen tool and then copy it for the other bow.
 Select all the objects together in this way: Ctrl + A > right click > group.
 The curve tool will enable you to create a nuanced drawing by adding curves and folds. Make sure to group the curve lines together.
 Set the following colors on the ribbon by following these combinations. Light Pink: C=0, M=17.8, Y=12, K=0 ; Darker Pink: C=2.35, M=47.06, Y=12.55, K=0


Here is the finished artwork. Keep in mind that you can easily change the colors according to your preference.

 An area of skin inflammation needs to be left alone in order to heal. However, your cat will likely continue to lick and clean the area as long as it is allowed to. With this in mind, your veterinarian will likely suggest that a cone, otherwise known as an e-collar or Elizabethan collar, be put on the cat so that it cannot disturb the area while it is being treated.


Keeping a cone on your cat can be very disconcerting but it is better for it to have a little temporary discomfort than an actual risk to its health.
 If your cat has inflamed skin, there are ways you can soothe it at home. Your veterinarian may suggest using an oatmeal shampoo on the area or a medicated lotion that can relieve itching and irritation. Even a warm water compress applied to the irritated area can provide some relief.Follow your veterinarian's suggestions about treatment of irritation. Depending on the cause of the irritation, you may want to use different solutions.
 If your cat is suffering from inflammation due to food allergies, you may need to change its diet in order to get rid of its skin inflammation. Consult with your veterinarian about what type of food you should be giving your cat, and remember to transition your cat to new food slowly.Special diets for cats with food allergies can be more expensive than other types of cat foods. However, it is important to feed them to cats with severe allergies so that their symptoms can be reduced.

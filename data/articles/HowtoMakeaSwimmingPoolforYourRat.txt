 It should be big enough to hold all your rats, with room for them to move around comfortably. It should be about as tall as your rat so that water won't spill out, but short enough that your rat can escape if it needs to.;
, Make sure not to add too much water, but don't worry about your rat drowning. They are excellent swimmers. Add water up to about your rat's stomach. This will be enough water for it to play around in without being dangerous.
 Your bathroom or kitchen usually work best, as it will be okay if water spills. Close the door to the room so that if the rat escapes from the pool, it will be easy to catch again - you don't want your rat running freely around the house. Put a towel down on the floor, and place the pool on top of the towel.
, Add frozen corn or peas along the bottom of the pool and watch your rats fish for their food. Disguise the corn or peas in piles of small pebbles so that your rats have to dig through the pebbles to reach the treats. You can also add tunnels, hoops, ladders, or anything else you think your rats might enjoy.
 Make sure the area around the pool is clean and dry and your rats are safe and happy.

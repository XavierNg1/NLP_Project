 On the side you will see a variety of options like:


Add as friend
Add as best friend
Report
Add as boyfriend;
,, Be patient here.


If he declines, consider changing the way you look.






If he declines, then ask him to be your friend. Maybe he just isn't ready.






If he accepts, then talk with him every day. Flirt if you can. When messaging say you are really hot!






If he already has a girlfriend, ask why he likes her.
 If you really want that guy to accept you, then before you do any of the above, get some new clothes. Get a cute dress or something. (If you really want to coax him in then wear a bikini or something and add a message like "Hot girl in need of boyfriend" or something like "Hot girl needs a guy to have 'fun'" these will really get that guy interested!).
 Exchange email addresses. When you have it, send flirty messages like "Send me a pic of yourself, I want to see how cute you are." At the end of every message, add kiss kiss at the end.
 Add comments like, "Wow you are great!"

, If he has a girlfriend, try to show that you are tons better. Change the way you look and say "I changed for you.."

, Sooner or later, he'll start to like you. Then ask (or ask again) if he wants to be your boyfriend.


If he says no, then list all the good things about you
If he still says no, say you are upset because of him.
If he really likes you, then he will agree.

 As nubuck is created by sanding cowhide, it can withstand sanding for cleaning purposes.For the toughest stains, rub them vigorously with sandpaper or a block until the stain is removed. If you only need to clean a specific stain, only sand that particular spot.









Make sure the block is clean before starting to sand the nubuck.
 If stains have settled in your nubuck surface, or it’s soiled all over, you’ll want to sand it completely. Run a block or sandpaper over its entire surface until the stains are removed. The nubuck will look practically brand new.
 As you sand the nubuck, you’ll be creating a fine dust composed of the leather and whatever grime it contained. Brush it away to keep your nubuck clear and clean.

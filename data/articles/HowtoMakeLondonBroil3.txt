 The broiler uses flames to cook the meat, so check your stove's manual before utilizing it for any safety warnings.


Use oven mitts or a thick dry rag when handling hot objects.
 Slide your grill out and place the London Broil in your preheated pan. Place the London Broil on the top rack, or 4-5 inches away from the open flame.Once it has cooked for 4-6 minutes, pull out your oven rack and flip the London Broil over with a large fork or tongs.


Crack your oven door to prevent your London Broil from burning., Allowing your meat to rest before cutting it will retain its juices and enable it to finish cooking.You can use a meat thermometer to ensure that your London Broil is done before serving. It should have an internal temperature of 130-135 degrees Fahrenheit (54-57 degrees Celcius) for a rare steak and 140-145 degrees Fahrenheit (60-62 degrees Celcius) for a medium-rare steak.
 Slicing against the grain of the meat will allow you to have a more tender piece of meat.Find the direction in which the fibers are going, and cut along them rather than parallel with them.

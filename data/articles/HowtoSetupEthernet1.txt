 Ethernet cables, also known as RJ-45 cables, have a square plug on each end. You'll use an Ethernet cable to connect your computer to your router.

The cable connecting your modem and your router is an Ethernet cable.;
, Your router should be connected to your modem, which should be connected to a Cable or Ethernet port in your wall, and you should see a constant light on the front of the router and/or modem.

If you just have a modem, simply make sure that it's attached to the Cable or Ethernet port in your wall.
 Ethernet ports are square, and they usually have an icon depicting a series of connected boxes near them.

On your router, Ethernet ports will typically say "LAN" (Local Area Network) above them.
If you're just connecting to a modem, the port you need will usually say "Internet" or "WAN" above it.
 As long as your router is online, doing so will connect your computer to the Internet almost immediately.

 Formal capelets look nicest with sleeveless or strapless dresses. Avoid wearing one with a dress that already has material around the shoulder, since too much layering will look bulky.
 Choose a flowy gown that extends past your knee. Match it with high heels, a clutch purse, and fitting jewelry. Complete the outfit with a soft chiffon capelet in a neutral color like white or black, depending on which coordinates best with the color of your dress.
 Wear a pair of strappy, sexy heels and sparkling jewelry. Select a black or silver capelet, and keep it pinned together with an embellished brooch.
 Select a free-flowing knee-length dress in a light color. Opt for simple jewelry over pieces that sparkle too much, and low heels over extremely high heels. Wrap everything together with a chiffon capelet in a light color. Opt for either a neutral colored capelet or one in a light pastel that matches a color found in your dress.
 Keep the dress simple, opting for plain prints over patterns and darker colors over pastels. Choose pearl or mock-pearl accessories and closed-toe or peep-toe heels.

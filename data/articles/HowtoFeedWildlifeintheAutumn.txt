 It should be in an area accessible to wildlife but also away from your indoor pets. Your backyard or apartment patio are good starting places. Keep in mind most wild animals may come out during the night.;

 Use a hanging feeder so that more birds than squirrels benefit from the food.
 Keep it at the opposite end from the bird feeder to avoid interaction or confusion.
 Be sure to change the water as often as needed to keep it fresh and clean. Birds and ground animals will greatly appreciate this addition to the garden.
 Either is fine, although hay is generally a food source whereas straw is used for bedding. Nonetheless, it will make an attractive harvest display and your animal friends will use it for food or nesting material (or perhaps both, depending on the animal)!

, Provided there is still corn attached, animals will use the corn for food and may use some parts of the plant for bedding (or they may also eat parts of the plant). Word of mouth gets out about corn very quickly, so expect lots of squirrels and raccoons to visit!

, Raccoons may help themselves to small squashes and baby pumpkins as a food source. If you decide to carve one of your pumpkins for Halloween, save the seeds and give them to the animals-they will find it a wonderful treat!

, They will thank you for feeding them right before winter!


Keep your camera ready! You never know when wildlife is going to visit, and when they see the plentiful bounty you've left them, they can get pretty excited!

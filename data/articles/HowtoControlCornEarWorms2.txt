 Corn earworm larvae is present all season, but is most abundant in late summer and early fall. Plant your corn crops early so they will be silking before the earworm population has peaked. Corn planted late, silks late, when many more moths are looking for places to lay eggs.

The timing of your chemical treatment is very important. Once the larva has gotten inside the corn ears chemical treatment is very difficult. Apply the insecticide when the corn plants are silking if you see a high number of eggs on the silk or if your plant check reveals an unacceptable worm count.

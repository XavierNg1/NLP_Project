 Before you begin filling out the guarantor form, make sure that you have all pertinent materials. Depending on the guarantor form, you may need bank statements or tax returns. Make sure that you have the materials, or at least the information on them, available when you begin filling out your guarantor form., When you begin filling out the form, it will ask for your personal information. This will include things like your name, home address, social security number, and phone number. You will need to provide this information so that the entity you are signing the agreement with can run a credit check., A guarantor form will also likely ask you to provide information about your financial background. You will need to include information about your income, current employment, and banking information. Because this is relatively sensitive information, avoid filling out this form in a public space., Once you have completed the form, you will need to sign it and have it notarized. You can find a notary online or at your bank. For a small fee, they will sign and stamp the form. After it is notarized, you will want to mail it to the lender or landlord.Be sure to mail the documents. The creditor or landlord will need to see the notarized stamp in person. If you send a copy, they will likely ask for the original.
If you are cosigning a loan, the financial institution you are making the agreement with will likely have a notary available.
If it is an auto loan, many car dealerships have a notary on staff.
 Once you have completed the guarantor form and returned it, ask the entity you signed the agreement with to send you a copy of the form, as well as all pertinent documents. You will need these for your records. You may also need them later if the person you cosigned for defaults.

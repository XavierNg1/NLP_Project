 The first thing to do is to check the model and generation of the server. This understanding will make it easier to find the right power cord.;
, It is important that the power cord you are choosing is certified by the National Electrical Manufacturers AssociationÂ (NEMA). Irrespective of the power cord you choose, ensure that it is NEMA certified. It will also make it easier to select the power cord plug.
 The voltage rating for plugs in North America ranges from 100-127 to 200-240. Confirm the voltage required to run your server before choosing the power cord.
 Another specification to check is the current rating. The ratings for North America are 15, 20, and 30. Knowing the voltage rating can help to accordingly find the power cord with the right current rating.
 The number of prongs in a plug varies from 2 to 5. The prongs can be oval, round, straight blade, and rectangular in shape. For North America, there 4 different types of power plugs - NEMA 5-15P, NEMA 5-20P, NEMA L6-20P, NEMA L15-30P. Knowledge of the current rating and voltage can help discern between the four types and choose the correct plug.
 The jumper cable is used to connect the server to the Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) unit. This allows the server to continue working in the event of a power failure. Follow the above procedures for selecting the right cable and plug.

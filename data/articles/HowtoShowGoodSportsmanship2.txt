 Even if you’re the best athlete on the field, you can’t win a game without your teammates. Everyone should share in team responsibilities, and do their part to ensure that the team is successful. You shouldn’t care about your own performance more than the team.It’s often little things that show you’re a team player, such as always arriving at practice on time or helping to clean up afterward.
Because the behavior of every team member reflects on the team, you shouldn’t accept unsportsmanlike conduct from your teammates. Firmly but politely remind them that their behavior affects the entire team.
 Being a good sport means that you’re just as happy with their success as your own. Cheer on your teammates when they’re performing well, and offer encouragement to teammates who may have made a mistake or are in a slump.Be willing to share your knowledge of the game with your teammates. If there is someone who is struggling with a particular part of the game that you excel at, offer some tips and suggestions to help him or her improve.
You should be receptive when teammates point out ways in which you can improve your skills too. Not everyone is good at the same aspects of a game, and you should take advantage of your teammates’ expertise to improve your skills.
 He or she is looking out for the good of the team, and sometimes, that means your role may be reduced or changed. Showing good sportsmanship means placing the team’s needs above your own, so you should trust the coach’s judgement.If you disagree with a decision that the coach has made, have a polite discussion with him or her. Don’t start an argument or sulk over it.
If the coach decides that someone else should start in your place, it’s normal to get upset. However, you must realize that it’s for the good of the team, and channel your frustration into working hard at practices so you’re ready to go for the next game.

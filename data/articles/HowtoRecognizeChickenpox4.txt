 The vaccine is considered safe and given to young children before they are exposed to the illness. The first dose is given at 15 months and the second dose between 4 and 6 years of age.Getting chickenpox vaccine is much safer than getting chickenpox disease. Most people who get the chickenpox vaccine do not have any problems with it. However, a vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, like severe allergic reactions. The risk of chickenpox vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small., Make sure to talk to your doctor about your decision. Vaccination is a personal choice for the parents. However, the older the child is when they get the illness, the worse they feel. If you choose to not give the vaccination, or if your child is or could be allergic to the vaccine, then try to expose them to the illness after age three and before age 10 to reduce symptoms and severity of the condition.
 Children who have had a vaccination can develop a milder form of the illness. They may only get approximately 50 spots and blisters which are less intense. This makes a diagnosis more difficult. However, they are as contagious as if they had the full blown illness.Adults are at risk for more severe disease and have a higher incidence of complications.
By far, the vaccination is preferable to so-called "pox parties" wherein parents purposefully infect their children. The vaccination may cause a mild case of chickenpox, but attending a pox party will most likely guarantee you or your child a full-blown case, which can lead to pneumonia and other terrible afflictions. In this case, you don't want to attend the party.

 Whether your dog is recovering from surgery or is facing deteriorating vision without surgery as an option, make a habit of following the same basic routine of care every day. Feed your dog at the same time. Try to play with them at around the same time. This will help your vision-impaired pet know what to expect., A dog who suffers from impaired vision will naturally come to rely more on their sense of smell. Play into this by using two signal aromas in your household-one for “good” and one for “bad.” Vanilla, for example, can be your good aroma. Wipe a few drops of vanilla scent on their food area and around the door frames to help with navigation.Bitter apple or peppermint could be your bad scent. Use this to warn against hazard areas, such as the edges of a fireplace.
 Avoid moving furniture around or making any major changes to the outlines of your living space. Make sure to keep your dog’s personal area the same as well by not moving their crate or food and water bowls around.
 Get down on your dog’s level and try to navigate around the house. Look for potential hazards in the form of sharp, low edges. Cover these edges with roll-out foam pieces. These foam barrier protectors are available online and in stores for babyproofing, but can also be used for pet proofing and safety.

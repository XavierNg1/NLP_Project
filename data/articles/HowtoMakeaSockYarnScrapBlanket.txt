 Remember to slip the first stitch of each row as if to purl and your decreases only happen on the right side (RS) of the work. Here's how:

Row 1: Loosely cast on 16 stitches, place marker, cast on a further 16 stitches (32 stitches in total).
Row 2: Knit on the wrong side (WS).
Row 3: Decrease row. Knit until you are 2 stitches before the marker. Knit the next two stitches together through the back of the loop and then knit to the end of the row (RS).
Row 4: Knit WS.
Repeat rows 3 and 4 until you are left with just 2 stitches on the needle (WS), pass the left stitch over the right stitch so you have just one stitch left and then fasten off.;
, If you are not a fan of sewing squares together though, try picking up stitches.

Look at your square as a diamond with the top point being where you finished knitting and fastened off. You can add a square (actually a diamond) to the right and left sides, and then add a diamond between those two diamonds. This photo should help:



 


When starting diamonds that are on the right side of the blanket (like the green one), loosely cast on the first 16 stitches using the long tail cast on. Then place marker and pick up 16 stitches alongside of diamond to the left of the new one.
For diamonds that are on the left edge of the blanket, pick up 16 stitches in the side of the diamond to the right, place marker, then loosely cast on 16 stitches using the cable cast on.
For diamonds that are not on the edges, pick up 16 stitches from the side of the diamond to the right, place marker, pick up center stitch from the tip of the diamond below, pick up 15 stitches on the side of the diamond to the left.
Rotate your work and you will end up with a nice square or rectangular blanket.
, Perhaps a crochet edge would be nice.

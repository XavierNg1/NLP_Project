 Generally, having 1 mil (this can be easily attained by making headless arrows, since free players can train members' skills up to level 5) or more would be ideal. There are so many items and new armour, that not having enough money can be a big setback. And instead of spending your time at Castle Wars, more often than not, you find yourself finding ways to make money to afford new weapons and items.
 Pay attention to the (non-member) items required, so you can prepare it in advance and spend less time doing quests.
 Level 70 or higher would be ideal for a new member, but you can still have a great time at any combat level.
 If you have played for at least 2 years for at least twice a week, you should be fine. Just know that if you don't know the Non-Member worlds and maps, getting to know the member areas, weapons, and game is going to be much different, and add to the challenge.

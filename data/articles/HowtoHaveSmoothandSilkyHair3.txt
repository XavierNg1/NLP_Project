 Applying heat to your hair can create a soft, silky effect. Use a round brush to brush out small sections of hair, starting at the roots and slowly brushing down to the tips. Angle the hair dryer at the section of hair as you brush it out. Repeat several times until the section is dry, then move on to the next one.


Using a heat protectant product will help ensure your hair looks smooth and silky.
Donâ€™t blow your hair out every single day, since it will eventually get dry and brittle. Save it for special occasions.
 For super smooth, silky hair, consider straightening it. First blow out your hair, then heat up a straightening iron and straighten it section by section. Make sure each section is combed out before using the iron.


Doing this too often is damaging to hair, so save it for when you want the smoothest hair possible.
You may also want to consider getting your hair professionally straightened. Look into permanent treatments offered by salons in your area.
 Trimming off the dry, coarse ends of your hair will keep your overall look lighter, smoother and softer. Get a trim every four months or so to keep your hair maintained and smooth-looking.
 Many salons offer professional conditioning treatments. The treatments are composed of special oils and other ingredients that penetrate the hair and leave it silky for days to come. A good coconut oil deep conditioning treatment has similar effects, but if you prefer professional treatment, ask about it at your local salon.

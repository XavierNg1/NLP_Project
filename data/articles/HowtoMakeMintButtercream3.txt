 Vegan mint buttercream is just as delicious as dairy-based mint buttercream and only requires a few minor adjustments. To begin, add the vegan butter, powdered sugar, soy milk, and mint extract into the bowl of an electric mixer.Many people favor soy milk as an alternative to dairy milk in baked goods because it has a comparable consistency. However, you can use almond, coconut or any kind of other milk alternative if you are allergic to soy or don’t like its flavor.
If you don’t have an electric mixer, you can mix by hand. The frosting will be thicker and heavier than if you mixed it using a mixer.
 Turn the mixer on to low speed and mix the ingredients, breaking up the butter and incorporating the powdered sugar into the wet ingredients. Keep mixing on low speed until all the ingredients are more or less combined, about five minutes., Once the ingredients have mixed together, increase the speed of the electric mixer, mixing on medium for 1- 2 minutes and then turning the speed up to high. Keep mixing on high until the frosting reaches the fluffiness and consistency that you desire., Use a flat knife to spread the vegan mint buttermilk frosting on whichever baked goods you have prepared, being sure to only add the frosting once the baked goods have cooled. Then enjoy your delicious vegan treat!

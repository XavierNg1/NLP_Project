 Pay extra attention to your intuition. Recognize it and as you are paying attention, this will open the door for more intuitive information to flow to you. Psychic information often comes out of the blue. If you experience an image, feeling, thought or other sense and you are not sure why it has come to you, calmly ask yourself why you are experiencing it and this allows more psychic information to flow to you.;
, The use of psychic intuition can make you tired. Physically and emotionally. Getting plenty of sleep makes you clear headed and available to receive psychic information. If you find yourself feeling emotionally down, tired or even confused, stop trying to access your intuition, lay down, take a nap or meditate. This will give you a chance to recharge and you will feel better.

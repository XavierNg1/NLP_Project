 Having an experienced person by your side is the best way to ensure that you make the right decision. An employee can help you decide between two or more options if you havenâ€™t quite narrowed down your list. If you already know which binoculars you want, he or she can point you right to them.
 Binoculars are multi-functional devices, and any good inspection should be as thorough as possible. Test the magnification on something far away. Fiddle with the zoom feature. Try different barrel spacing. Make sure nothing is left to chance before taking the binoculars home.
 Retain the receipt in case you have a problem with the binoculars.

 That should be every DIY photographer's first stop. Some things that you can find there are:


Affordable white linen sheets. You can use those for backdrops, light boxes, and tents.






Actual photograph supplies, like tripods.






Photographic subjects for practicing






Frames. You can use the frame for creating a diffuser and you can use the glass/Plexiglas for a variety of purposes.





;
, PVC and Duct tape (or gaffer's tape) are staples of DIY photographers everywhere. You can also check out their clearances to see what you can find like planks and Plexiglas and mirrors to help build your studio.
 Pringles are a great resource for making different lights for your studio.
 The bags that chips come in are usually made of mylar. Instead of throwing them away, wash them out and save for later. Also, cereal often has a translucent type of material inside of the box. You can use that for diffusion material.


Another source of the mylar and/or reflective material are the birthday balloons that you see at most checkouts.
 Just about every city has dollar stores or something similar. You can find the balloons there, as well as poster board and rigid foam boards that you can make your own somewhat professional soft box from.
 Inexpensive options can be found just about anywhere.

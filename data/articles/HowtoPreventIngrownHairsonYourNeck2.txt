 It’s easy to forget about washing the skin of your neck if you’re focused on tending to your face. However, include your neck in your regular hygiene process. It can improve your skin and help prevent ingrown hairs. Use the same cleanser on your neck that you use on your face – a mild and non-comedogenic cleanser is best for daily use, as bar soap can dry out your skin., Scrub away dead skin and dirt by exfoliating your neck on a weekly basis. This will help prevent ingrown hairs by clearing out your pores. Lather up a clean washcloth in the shower and gently scrub the skin of your neck, using small circular motions. Rinse off with warm water. For the best effect, use a product that contains tretinoin (for instance, Renova or Retin-A) to clear away dead skin cells.You can also use an exfoliating loofah or sponge, or an exfoliating facial product on your neck.
If you have oily or acne-prone skin, lather up with a cleanser that contains salicylic acid or beta hydroxy acid to unclog your pores.If you have sensitive or dry skin, avoid these products and consult with your doctor regarding the best exfoliation method for your skin type.
 Get a gentle, non-comedogenic moisturizer – the kind that won’t clog your pores. Having smooth, soft skin may help prevent ingrown hairs. Use moisturizer daily after you wash your neck.Apply moisturizing lotion while your skin is still damp to best trap moisture in your skin.
 Constantly wearing collared shirts, ties, or scarves can rub against your skin and cause irritation. Try wearing collarless shirts for a while to let your skin calm down.Stick to outfits that don’t rub on the skin of your neck, if possible.

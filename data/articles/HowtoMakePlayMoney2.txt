 You can use any kind of paper without a pre-made design on it, for example colored construction paper. Printer paper works fine, as does construction paper. If you want to mimic the feeling of a dollar bill you’ll have to buy paper with 25 % cotton and 75 % linen.You can find this type of paper online, but it is more expensive.
 Since it’s play money, it doesn’t need to be particularly serious. However, you should make sure that the amount of the money is easy to understand and unambiguous. Think of a cool design that you want for each denomination (1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 bills).


Have originality and think of other number bills that don't exist that you want to make, such as 6, 25, or 10000 dollar bills.
If you are using construction paper, you may want to use one color for each dollar value to make it easier.
 The standard shape of a regular dollar bill is a rectangle and the dimensions are 2.61 inches wide by 6.14 inches long.Cut them smaller, larger, or even another shape such as a triangle or square if you desire.
 Make sure that the bill value is clear to read. It's up to you to color and use one or both sides of the bill. A regular money bill uses both sides, while Monopoly money uses one side.


Clip or organize each stack of bills by the value. Use them in your next game!

 An excellent way to add volume and length to your lashes is to build up layers of mascara. This is achieved by alternating between the eyelash curler and two different types of mascara. Before starting this process, make sure your lashes are curled.]


Select a light, natural mascara formula and remove the applicator. Wipe off any excess mascara on the lip of the bottle.
As you run the applicator from the root to the tip of your right lashes, wiggle the brush from side to side. Don’t forget to coat each side of your right lashes.
Repeat this process on the left lashes.
Allow the product to dry for 1 to 2 minutes., Once the first coat of mascara is dry, it is time to curl your lashes again. The key to perfectly curved fringe is to curl the roots, middle, and tip of your lashes.


As you position the curler at the base of your lashes, look down. Keep the curler closed on your lashes for 8 seconds.
Open the curler and slide it to the middle of your lashes. Clamp down and hold for 8 seconds.
Open the curler and move the tool to the tips of your lashes. Hold the tool closed for 8 seconds. Release the tool and remove it from your lashes.
Repeat on your other set of lashes., After curling each set of lashes, you can continue to build up the volume and length of your fringe. Instead of a natural mascara, select a volumizing formula.


Remove the brush from the bottle. Wipe off the excess mascara on the lip of the bottle.
Coat your curled right lashes from root to tip, wiggling the brush as you move through your lashes. Cover the opposite side of your right lashes too.
Insert the brush into the mascara and remove any excess product.
Brush through your curled left lashes with a wiggling motion. Don’t forget to apply the product to the opposite side of your left lashes as well.
Repeat if desired.
Step back and admire your gorgeous faux-long lashes in the mirror.

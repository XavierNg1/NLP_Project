 Pick a few non-permanent markers that look like a good bruise color. Dark reds, blues and purples are all good choices. Use a brownish yellow (or yellow and brown) marker for the outside edges, as well.


Make sure to not use metallic or glitter markers, which will look obviously fake when you get them onto your skin.
Highlighters give a great yellow-bruise look as well. Use a highlighter instead of a yellow marker, if you've got a highlighter on hand.
 Draw a small circular-shaped shape in red at the center where you want your bruises to be, using a very small amount of marker on your skin. It's easy for this to look like the least authentic of all the fake bruises, so go easy on the marker.


Use little dots of color and blend the colors together later. It's not important that it be bruise-shaped right now. Just get the colors on your skin.
 Real bruises aren't just one color, but a variety of weird little marks. Go over the red with darker colors to smooth it out, using little dabs of the other colors you're using over top of the red circular shaped area. Go around the outside of the shape with the yellow when you're finished, blending everything outward.
 Smear the colors to make it look more bruise-shaped and realistic. Get one of your fingers wet and immediately rinse the area a little, blending the colors in. This helps to make it look a lot more realistic.

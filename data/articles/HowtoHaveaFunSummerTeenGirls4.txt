 If you haven't already. You need one that:


Keeps your hair clean, so it doesn't need washing every day.
Keeps the colour vibrant
Makes your hair shiny and soft

,, Make sure you get a regular trim every 6 weeks or so.
 Even if you're not going out. Greasy hair can affect your skin, and even how you smell! And also, it'll make you feel better. Who doesn't love soft and nice smelling hair? Aim for every other day.
 If you are going abroad, buy a spray or shampoo that protects your hair from the sun.

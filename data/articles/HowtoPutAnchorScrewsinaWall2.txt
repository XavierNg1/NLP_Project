 If your picture frame or mirror has a wire-hanger in the back, be sure to take into account the amount of slack when figuring-out where you want the picture or mirror to hang.
 If the picture frame or mirror has multiple hooks on the back, be sure to measure the distance between them. Use a level to measure the spot for your second anchor. Make another small pencil mark where the second anchor will be installed.


You can also apply a bit of grease or lipstick on the hooks of the item you will hang. Place the item where you want it on the wall and gently press it against the wall. The grease or lipstick will leave a mark to show you where to install your anchors.
 Be sure that you hold the drill perpendicular to the wall so that the anchor will sit parallel to the ground: an anchor that is not installed straight will not be able to support as much weight. You should drill a hole that is approximately the same size as the anchor itself (the screw will force it to expand outward).Make sure the hole you drill is deeper than the anchor is long.
 If the hole is too small, the anchor will collapse onto itself and may not install properly. Push it in until the anchor sits flush against the wall. Do not bang on the screw because it could bend or break.


If needed, tap the anchor with a rubber mallet lightly to get it to sit flush against the surface of the wall.
 Line up the screw and the anchor and, using either a philips or flat head screwdriver, turn the screw clockwise just until the base of the screw comes to rest against the base of the anchor.









If the object you are hanging has a mounting bracket, you may need to slide the screw through the bracket before screwing it into the anchor.
 Be sure to leave just-enough of the screw exposed to "catch" the hanger on the back of picture frame or mirror. A good rule of thumb is to leave about a 1/4" of screw exposed for hanging.

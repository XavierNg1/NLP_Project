 Some groups are formal and some are informal, but whatever your interests are, you're likely to find members on YouTube who have several videos that are quite popular on the subject, and other members who post similar videos or response videos.If you want to have a constant source of video inspiration, spend some time exploring these communities and start slowly entering into one of them. Some popular YouTube communities exist around:


Video games
Sports talk
Food, drink, movie, and music reviews
Magic tricks
ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response)
Eating challenges

, Staying up to date on the videos that content creators you really admire or enjoy is a good way to keep your foot in the door of the same community that they're participating in. Comment on videos you like and follow the trends of the kinds of videos you're interested in making yourself.
 Many communities, and especially popular YouTube channel hosts, will have open calls for response videos that you can upload and link to the original video. So, if someone is talking about the upcoming NCAA championship game and wants to know your prediction of the score and your reasons for saying so, it might be a good opportunity to make a video and upload it.


Challenges like the cinnamon challenge or the gallon of milk challenge were quite popular at one point. Keep an eye out for opportunities to participate in this kind of YouTube conversation.
 It may take a while before you get many people to watch your videos, and that's ok. Whatever the case, if you've got some viewers, request they record response videos to a question you've asked or something you've said in another of your videos. Start a conversation and treat YouTube as a means of having a dialog.

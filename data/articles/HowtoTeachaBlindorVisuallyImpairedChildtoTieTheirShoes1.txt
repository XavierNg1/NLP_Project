 Teachers of the blind and visually impaired often stress the importance of learning age-appropriate skills, which contributes to developing motor functioning and increasing independence.Most children learn to tie their shoes between the ages of five and seven, so a blind child should also start learning during this age range.Start off slow with the child, since learning this skill won't happen overnight. You don't have to start until you feel they're ready.
Until they learn to tie their own laces, keep the child in Velcro-fastened shoes.;
, The most ideal time is when the child would typically be taking their shoes on/off. For instance, you could work a practice session into your child’s daily dressing routine each morning. If you’re running late, don’t rush through your usual practice session. Instead, make it a point to practice with the child later that day, when there’s plenty of time for them to sit down and attempt it multiple times.

Forcing a practice session when you have to rush may cause the child to feel frustrated.
Summer vacation and spring break are other good times to focus on learning this skill, since the child's schedule is a little looser.
 Until they’ve mastered the skill themselves, encourage your child to assist in whatever way as you're helping them get into their shoes. For instance, you could ask the child to help you loop a shoestring around your finger or place their hands on top of yours to feel the motions. Describe your actions clearly as they assist you., There is no single way to tie shoe laces; there are a variety of approaches. Decide which one you think will be easiest for your child and make sure that you teach only that technique consistently. If other members of your family are also helping to teach the child, make sure they know which technique you’re using and stick to that one.

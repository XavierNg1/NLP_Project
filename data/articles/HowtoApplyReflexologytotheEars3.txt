 Not everyone should do reflexology. If you have any of the following health conditions, refrain from reflexology:Deep vein thrombosis
Thrombophlebitis
Cellulite on your feet or your hands

, Reflexology is not a medical science. While some people find it effectively helps manage aches and pains, you should not rely on it to treat chronic conditions. Any type of ache or pain that does not go away on its own should be evaluated by a medical professional., If you have a chronic condition, remember reflexology will not cure it. Something like chronic sinus issues, for example, will continue to be an issue even when using reflexology. Think of reflexology as a means to ease symptoms rather than cure a medical ailment.

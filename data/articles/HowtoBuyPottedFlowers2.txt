 Examine the bottoms of leaves and where leaves connect to branches.
 Plants that are in full bloom in the store will lose their flowers shortly after bringing them home.



Look at the roots that are starting to emerge from the drain holes in bottom of the pot. The roots should be flexible. Don't buy the plant if the roots are brittle or dehydrated.
Reject potted flowers if roots are visible above the potting dirt.
 These decide the plant's shapeliness and density.


Choose flowering plants with major stems that are sturdy and robust. Reject potted flowers with broken or wounded stems.
Buy potted flowers with at least 6 main stems accented by a few smaller branches. Avoid any that only have 1 dominant trunk.
Look for stems that are well balanced around the plant. This is preferable to stems concentrated on just 1 side.



Choose short potted flowers with thick foliage. Reject potted flowers that are tall and frail.
Select potted flowers with new growth. Budding leaves are a sign of good health.
Avoid plants with limp, wilting, yellow, speckled or browning leaves.
Be wary of potted flowers treated with a man-made leaf shiner. Leaves appearing unusually glossy or feeling slick have probably been artificially polished.

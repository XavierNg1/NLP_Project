 Technically, the shorter the cable electricity flows through, the quicker it takes to get from its source to its destination. The same physics principle applies to your Apple device. Apple devices come with a one meter data cable that you use for charging your unit. Measure the cable youâ€™re using to see how long the electricity has to travel from your charger to your iOS unit.
 After knowing the length of your data cable, purchase a shorter cable from a local electronics store or nearest Apple Store in your area. Data cables can be as short as 5 inches, and price ranges starting from a $5 up to $30, depending on the brand. For safety reasons, make sure that you get an original Apple cable.
 Connect your shorter data cable to your charger, plug the charger to a power outlet, and connect your iOS device to start charging. Measure the time it takes to charge your iOS device and compare it to the time it takes to fully charge your device using your longer cable. Charging time should decrease at least several minutes since the power needs to travel only a short distance from the charger to your iOS device.

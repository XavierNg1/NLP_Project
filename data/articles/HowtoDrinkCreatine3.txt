 During the initial stage, your dose should be .35 g of creatine per kg of body weight. Divide the total number per day into easily consumable amounts.


For example, if you weigh 68 kg (150 pounds), multiply that by .35 to find that your daily dosage should be 23.8 g. That means you should take just under 6 grams of creatine per dose, 4 times per day.
 During the second week, taper off to a dosage of .15 g of creatine per kg of body weight. This time, divide the total dose into 2 or 3 easily consumable amounts.


If you weigh 68 kg (150 pounds), multiply that by .15 to find that your your daily dosage should be 10.2 grams of creatine per day. You can divide that into two doses of 5.1 grams, or divide it into three doses of 3.4 grams. Choose the option that's most convenient for your lifestyle.

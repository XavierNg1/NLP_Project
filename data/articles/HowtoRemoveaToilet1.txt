 Begin by turning off the shutoff valve on the water supply line. Then flush the toilet to remove all the water from the tank and the bowl. Disconnect both ends of the water supply tube at the shutoff valve and at the toilet tank.


You want the toilet and tank to be as dry as possible before you remove it, so go a step further and use a sponge to soak up any water that's left after you flush.;
, Use a ratchet wrench or a basin wrench to remove the nuts from the mounting bolts that hold the tank onto the bowl. There will be one on each side of the tank, and there may even be a third one in the middle. Gently lift the tank off the bowl.


Once the tank is off , remove it from the bathroom or set it to the side or somewhere it won't be in the way.
 Pry the trim caps off the floor bolts. Use an adjustable wrench to remove the nuts from the floor bolts.


If you can't get the nuts off, try spraying them with penetrating oil. If you're still unsuccessful, you may have to use a nut splitter or cut the bolts with a hacksaw.
 There is a wax ring under the toilet that seals the bottom of the bowl to the end of the drain pipe (called the toilet flange). Straddle the toilet and gently rock it from side to side in order to break the seal. Once you do, lift off the bowl and place it nearby on its side.
 Using a putty knife, scrape away the old wax from the toilet flange and from the bottom of the toilet. Throw the old wax in a bucket line with a plastic bag. Clean the flange with a stiff wire brush.
 Put a rag inside the toilet flange/drainpipe to keep sewer gases from coming into the bathroom. Place a bucket upside-down over your rag.

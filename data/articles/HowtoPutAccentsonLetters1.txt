 Shortcut keys work on most newer PCs that run Microsoft Word.They tend to be faster and easier to remember than using ASCII Code to create accents.;
, Hold the Control key down, then tap the accent key near the top left corner of your keypad. Release the keys. Then select the desired letter to accent.


The accent key is usually on the same key as the ~. It is not the apostrophe key.
 Hold Control, then tap the apostrophe key. You can find the apostrophe next to the enter key. Release the keys. Then select the desired letter to accent.
 Hold down the Control and Shift keys then tap the 6 key. Release the keys and select the desired letter. The 6 key is used because of the ^ character found above the number.
 You will find the tilde is the same key used to make the grave accent. Be sure to hold down the Shift key or you will end up with a grave accent instead. Release the keys, then select the desired letter.
 The colon key can be found next to the apostrophe key. You must hold down the Shift key to select the colon as opposed to the semicolon. Release the keys. Now select the letter.
 However, this time, simply type the shift key straight after typing the Control + (choice), then type the letter. It will automatically capitalize.

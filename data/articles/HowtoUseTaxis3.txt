 Taxis within a certain city often have similar makes/colors. Taxis in New York City, for example, are often yellow so city-goers can see them from a distance. But taxis in Munich are sleek and cream-colored. Generally taxis in London are black, as are taxis in Japan. A unique-looking taxi isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but you may want to check other indicators of authenticity, like a meter or your driver's ID badge., Authorized taxis will usually have a meter for determining the charge. Usually, the meter is located on the cab's hood or in the car, near the driver's seat. Taxis are also often equipped with radios to take calls from dispatchers. If you can't see a meter or a radio, do not get in the car.Sometimes, especially in new car models, taximeters can be hard to spot. If you're not sure, ask your cabbie to point it out.
 Taxi drivers are required to carry and display their ID badge in most countries. Their badge should have their name, a recent photo, and the company they work for. In most cases, the ID badge will be visibly hanging inside the video. If this is not the case, ask your driver to see their ID.

Do not enter the car under any circumstances if they refuse., Illegitimate taxi drivers may try to steal from their passengers. Do not put your bags or luggage in the trunk. Instead, ask to keep them on the floor by your feet if there's room. If you're carrying expensive items, make sure you know where they are at all times.

 Look for a speedo made of 100% polyester or a polyester blend with spandex. It will be more chlorine resistant and long lasting. Some speedos are also made in a high UV rating fabric, making them more resistant to the sun if you plan to swim outdoors.Avoid speedos made of only spandex or lycra, as they tend to fade and get loose more quickly.
Opt for a speedo that is fully lined so it is not transparent.;
, Try on the speedo in the story before you buy it. You may need to wear it over underwear or use a disposable liner in the speedo. Make sure the speedo is not too tight or constricting. It should feel snug but the fabric should not dig into your skin.Walk around, squat, and sit in the speedo to ensure it is comfortable. If it feels comfortable on you, you will likely be more confident wearing it around.
 Go for a dark, neutral color like black, navy, or brown if you do not want to call too much attention to yourself when you are wearing the speedo. If you have a lighter skin tone, you may opt for a warm color like brown or a burnt orange. If you have a darker skin tone, a cooler color like navy or gray may be ideal.When in doubt, black is a good, neutral color for the speedo. It can also be more slimming and flattering.

 There are also other flavored coffee syrup variations that are a little more involved than just simple syrup, and they include caramel and hazelnut syrups. For the caramel, combine the sugar, corn syrup, and ¼ cup (59 ml) of the water in a small saucepan.


Heat the mixture over medium-high heat and bring it to a boil. Cover the pan with a lid and boil for two to three minutes.
Reserve ½ cup (119 ml) of water, because you will use this later to thin out the caramel sauce and turn it into syrup.
 After boiling for two to three minutes, keep the pan on the heat and remove the lid. Continue heating and stirring the mixture until it becomes light amber in color.


Remove the pan from the heat.
 Slowly whisk in the remaining ½ cup (119 ml) of water, the vanilla, and the salt. Be very careful, as the hot caramel sauce may spatter when you add the water.


Cool the mixture before serving or bottling. Store in the refrigerator.

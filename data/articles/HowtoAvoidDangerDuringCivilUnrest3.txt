 If rioting is imminent, secure your home and business. Rioting often brings looting, and looters can pillage and destroy your property. Make sure your doors are locked, and board up all your windows. Remove small valuables to a safer place if possible, since determined rioters will get in just about anywhere.
 First-floor windows are more vulnerable than others, and doors without deadbolts are less secure. It’s possible that civil unrest incidents can spill over to other areas, such as your house, and you need to ensure that you have adequate locks on all of your doors and windows., It is important to know local laws governing self defense, no matter how you plan to defend yourself and your home. You don’t want to find yourself in trouble after the unrest has been controlled because you violated the law. This is equally important if you are in another city, state, or country.

 Options include watching a movie, slow dancing to (low-volume) music, giving back rubs or foot rubs, or maybe even taking a bath together if you are in an intimate relationship and have a bathtub. If you want to share dinner and a movie, consider ordering food in to cut down on your expended energy. Pick a movie in advance if you have to rent it outside your home, or choose it spontaneously if you have access to online services like Amazon Instant Video or Netflix.
Â  If you would rather cook an elaborate dinner and eat it by candlelight, try to either shop for the ingredients in advance or enlist help to get everything together. Some grocery stores deliver. Alternately, you could decide to make something that consists mostly of ingredients you already have or combine ready-made elements. Try not to create too much noise while cooking to avoid disturbing the children.
 If your partner visits only occasionally, having them around while you are getting the children ready for bed might keep the children up. Arrange for them to have a key or call your phone or text when they get to your house, as to not wake the children.
 Whether you prefer to eat on the couch or at a nicely set table, now is the time. Enjoy your meal together.

 While standing, hold the sheet horizontally in front of you. Fold the sheet widthwise until it is the proper length. It should cover from your waist to the ground.
 Holding the folded sheet horizontally behind you at your waist. Wrap a few feet of one end around your waist to make a skirt. Tuck this short length behind your back.
 Still holding the folded sheet horizontally behind you. Now wrap the longer end around to the front. when crossing your front, pin the upper rail of the two ends together at your waist.
 Continue this longer end all the way around your body, across the front of your waist, under your arm, and across your the back. Then back to the front again, under your arm.
 Once the longer end is at the front again, cross over your chest and over the opposite shoulder. The end will drape over your shoulder and rest on your back.

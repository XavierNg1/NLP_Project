 Add to a large stock pot filled 2/3 or so with water. Cover and bring to a boil.
 Add two hens to the water. Cover again and allow to just barely simmer for 60 minutes or until completely cooked through. You can check this with a meat thermometer - you're looking for 180 degrees internally.
 Allow them to cool until they hold together more easily when handled.
 (You can use propane too, but it's not as good.) Brush the rack with a little canola oil.
 Brush onto the hens immediately before putting them on the grill.
 You're not 'cooking' the meat at this point, just getting flavor and color onto it, so use your judgement. You may have to flip them more than once to keep them from burning.
 Slice or cut enough to serve 4.

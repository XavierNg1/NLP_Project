 Get two identical cameras and make sure the lenses are 2-8 inches apart. It helps to create a device that holds them both from the tripod screw spots on the bottom. The cameras need to be setup so they are side by side, facing the same direction.Three inches works best, but the greater the distance the greater the 3D effect.
You’ll also need a decent video editing software. The software will need to be able to manage two separate videos and adjust the colors.
 You can film whatever you want in 3D with both cameras, but understand that 3D video should not be overused. The most typical use of 3D film is for action movies. This is the best application because the action literally comes out of the screen into your world. For a serious drama that is dialogue based, consider 2D unless you're making an experimental video.
 You’ll need a competent video editing software. All softwares have their own protocols for importing video. This is typically found under file/import off of the menu bar.
 Adjust the tint of the left video to be red. Make the right camera's video have a blue overlay. The result should be the same video in two colors around three inches apart.


If you only see one video and one color, you’ll need to adjust the transparency or opacity. Whichever video is the top layer will need to be adjusted about 50% opacity., Once you’ve adjusted the colors and opacity, test the footage with 3D glasses. You should see a the intended 3D effect. If not, you should try experimenting with the settings.


You might need to switch the colors darker or lighter shades. You might even change the distance of the lenses when filming.

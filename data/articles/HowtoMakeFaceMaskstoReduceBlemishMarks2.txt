 Make sure not to use any soap or cleansers. If you are wearing make up then use make up remover wipes and rinse your face thoroughly with Lukewarm water. Pat your face dry with a clean towel.
 Apply it using your brush or fingers directly onto your skin in upward motions, this helps to lift and tighten the skin as the mask dries. Apply it all over the face avoiding the eye area (you can apply it to your dark circles but be careful not to get it into your eyes) and you can also apply it to your neck.
 Once face is clear of the mask, pat dry with a towel.

We suggest that you wash the hair at least once to twice a week with warm or cold water. Wash the hair immediately after swimming, spa, exercise, and etc. When dirt and sweat accumulate, hair tangles. Too much leave-in conditioners and other hair care products will create a build up on the hair and will cause it to tangle faster. If the hair feels dry or heavy with build up, wash it with a good moisturizing shampoo & conditioner.;
, NEVER SLEEP ON WET HAIR. Make sure the hair is completely dry before going to bed.
 You can also make a leave-in conditioner at home by diluting conditioner (10%) with water (90%). Apply the mixture lightly onto your hair and brush the hair from the end to the top near the scalp.
 Treat the extension hair like your own hair. You should be able to take a small tooth rat tail comb and comb through without any problems.

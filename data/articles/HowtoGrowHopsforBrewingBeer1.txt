 Hop plants are grown from hop rhizomes, pieces of a hop plant that sprout into a new plant. Rhizomes are available early in the spring, when hop farmers dig them up and sell them to suppliers. Order rhizomes online or check with your local nursery. Plan to plant them in late spring, after the last frost.


Conduct research to decide what variety of rhizomes to buy. Hops affect the flavor of beer. Do you plan to brew a light, citrusy beer, or perhaps one that's woodsy or floral? Choose a variety that fits with the type of beer you want to create.
When your hops arrive, wrap them in damp paper towels and store them in the refrigerator to keep them from drying out until you're ready to plant them.;
, Scout out an area in your yard that gets at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight every day. In addition to needing a lot of sun, hops require the following conditions to thrive:


Plenty of vertical space. Hops grow on vines that stretch 25 feet (7.6Â m) or longer into the air. You can choose a planting spot near your house, so you'll be able to lean a tall trellis against the roof. If you'd rather not use your roof to prop up the bines, the trellis can instead be propped against a sturdy pole or another structure close to the garden.
Well-drained soil. Choose a spot that has good drainage; if you often see water standing over an area after a heavy rain, that means the soil there doesn't drain well.
 Measure out the area where you want to plant the hops, and use a garden rake and hoe or a soil tiller to break up the soil. It should be loose, with no large clumps or dense spots. Remove stones and sticks from the area and pull out any weeds by the root.


Fertilize the soil by raking in some manure, bone meal, blood meal or compost tea. These help plants grow healthy and strong by enriching soil with nutrients it lacks.
Make sure the soil is loose and fertilized to a depth of at least one foot.

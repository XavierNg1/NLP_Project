 This is a delicate situation at best, but remember that your friend is unlikely to stop wanting to be your friend just because you asked her out, even if she doesn't want to go on a date. The bigger problem is likely to come from you, as you try to move on from asking her. If all your hopes and dreams are hinging on getting a date with your friend, you are probably in for a lot of disappointment.
 This can potentially save you a lot of embarrassment in front of mutual friends. If your friend has half as much respect for you as you have for her, she won't embarrass you about it after the fact. If she does cause a scene, she wasn't worth it anyway.
 Don't declare your love – just ask her to come on a date with you. It may very well be that you do love your friend, but saying it won't change anything because it doesn't give her any concrete reason to consider dating you. It's better to keep your feelings on the down low and treat your offer like any other.


Make sure you're very clear that you're asking for a romantic date, and not just a time to hang out. Hiding or muddling your intentions won't help anything.
 No matter what the result of your offer to take your friend on a date, the onus of responsibility is on you to be mature and graceful. If she says yes, that's great – but it's still no time to unload anything on her. After all, you haven't even gone on a first date yet. If she says no, don't take out your disappointment on her, either. Instead, excuse yourself (she'll understand) and go home to mourn in private.

 Start around the midsection and then try to work the legs up towards the armpits for better control. If the opponent is very large, or if you are otherwise unable to do this, wrap your legs around one of his legs. This hold is known as the half-guard.
, Excessive squeezing will simply wear you out.
 This is essential. As counter-intuitive as it may seem, penetration is very difficult from this position, especially when the legs are up in the armpits. Removing clothing is even more difficult.
 This will limit his ability to strike with his fists or elbows as well as help control his waist and torso. Any strength advantage is offset in this position!

, Understand that all submissions must be fully applied. You will cause significant harm to your assailant.

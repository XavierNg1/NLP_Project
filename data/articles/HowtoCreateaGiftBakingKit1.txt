 Write down the list of what you want to put in your kit. Some ideas include: baking Equipment (spatula, sifter, measuring cup/spoons etc.), a baking recipe book, cake mix, cute cookie cutters (bunnies, stars, snowmen, fairies etc.), sprinkles, cupcake tray, baking cups, sugar decorations, candy (M&Ms, Smarties, cashews etc.).;
, Buy a basket big enough to hold all the items. Don't buy a recipe book. That will be explained later.

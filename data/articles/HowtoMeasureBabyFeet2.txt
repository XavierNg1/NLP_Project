 Grab a tape measure, and enlist someone else to help you keep your child still.
 Have your baby stand as still as possible (have someone else help minimize the squirming and fidgeting).
 For each foot, put the broad side of the tape measure against the outside, with the end of the tape measure either on the tip of the big toe or the end of the heel.


For best results, measure two or three times. Babies wiggle a lot, and it can be difficult to get an accurate measurement.
 Write down your measurements, and shop accordingly.

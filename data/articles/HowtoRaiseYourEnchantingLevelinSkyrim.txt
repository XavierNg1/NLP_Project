 There are certain books in Skyrim that will boost your skills. Some of them will increase your enchanting skill. Whenever you see a book you haven’t already read, read it. Even books owned by an NPC (Non Player Character) can be read without stealing and gain skill ups from. Just press the “Steal” button and put it back where you found it., Over the course of the game you will come across many soul gems. You can buy them, get them as drops, or steal them. You can also get a spell called Soul Trap by training up the Conjuration skill which will fill empty soul gems you may find. Every filled soul gem is an opportunity to use your enchantment skill and level it.
 If you pick up a blank piece of armor off a monster, keep it until you can enchant it. This will benefit you in a couple of ways. Even if you do not intend to use the armor and just want to sell it, enchanted armor sells for more and you will have the opportunity to use your enchanting skill. If you find armor with an enchantment on it you do not already have, disenchant it at an enchanting station in order to learn that enchantment for later use.
 When you enchant armor, weapons, and accessories, you are leveling your enchanting skill. As you level up the skill, you can choose perks that will increase your chance of stronger enchantments, add the Soul Trap skill directly onto weapons, and most importantly, gain the ability to add multiple enchantments to an item.

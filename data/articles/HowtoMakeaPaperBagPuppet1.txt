 Keep the bottom flap facing up. Point the opening toward you.;
, Draw the upper lip on the flap, along its lower edge. Then draw the lower lip on the body of the bag, where the edge of the flap meets it. Use the entire width of the flap to create an exaggerated mouth if desired, or a smaller one in proportion to the other facial features.
 Use pencils, pens, crayons, and/or markers to draw outlines for the facial features (nose, eyes, eyebrows, and ears, as well as hair if desired).Then color them in.
 Open the flap. Be careful not to smooth out any creases. Draw the tongue below the crease that you find under the flap. Add the throat and uvula above the crease if desired.


Alternately, you can cut out a small hole here wide enough for your finger and use that as your tongue.
 Excluding the flap, use the lower three-quarters of the bag’s body to design your puppet’s body.For people, outline clothes and color them in. For animals, outline their color pattern and then color in.
 Slide your hand into the opening. Curl your fingers up and under the flap. Extend and curl your fingers to make your puppet “talk.”

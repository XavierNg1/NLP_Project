 A wound watch will run accurately from 18 to 36 hours - depending on the mechanism. Larger watches have larger mechanisms. Smaller watches have smaller, more delicate mechanisms.









Mechanical watches should be wound at least weekly, even if they are in storage.
It might become routine if you wind the watch when dressing in the morning or before bed.
 You don’t need to purchase specialty oils or cleaners to care for your watch. Clean your watch with a toothbrush and warm water. Dip the toothbrush in the warm water and wipe off the bristles to remove excess water. Scrub the exterior and inside the stem with the toothbrush.








Don’t use too much force when cleaning inside the stem and crown.
Don’t remove the screws and attempt to clean the gears, unless you know how to. Consult a watch specialist about cleaning the inside of your wristwatch.
 Watches are delicate instruments and you should be cautious when putting one away in storage. The best way to protect your watch is by wrapping it in a protective coating. This could be bubble wrap or another packaging protective fabric.


You should store the watch in an environment that is cool, clean, and dust free. Keep the watch out of direct sunlight.You should attempt to wind it every week while in storage.

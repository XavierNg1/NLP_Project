 This will allow you to declare integers and Boolean types without receiving syntax errors.
 This will be the integer you base your if...else loop on.
 You may use a cout statement to let users know which number to input, but it is essential to declare a cin statement, so they can input a value for x.
 This is the first part of the if...else loop. By writing if(x==1), and then having a cout statement "True" in the body of the if statement, you can ensure that an input of 1 will return the cout statement you have written.
 Since "else" is used for all remaining possibilities, it does not require an expression. Output the statement "False" in the else body.
 To do this, select debug, and click "Start Without Debugging". If it asks you to build the program, press Yes.
 To do this, enter 1 in the program and press enter. You should receive the output "True".
 Enter any number other than 1. You should receive the output "False".

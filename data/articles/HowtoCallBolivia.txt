 It's possible that the number you have at hand is not correct. Phone numbers from Bolivia are composed of 7 numbers and the first digit must be a number between 2 and 8. Note that this is the local number without the region or country code.;
, Bolivia has 9 departments (administrative divisions): Sucre, La Paz, Santa Cruz, Cochabamba, Beni, Tarija, Oruro, Potosí, and Pando. Ask the person which department you'll call to make it easier to know the region code.



Chuquisaca (Sucre) —— 64xxxxx
Cobija (Pando) —— 842xxxx
Cochabamba —— 4xxxxxx
La Paz —— 2xxxxxx
Oruro —— 52xxxxx
Potosí —— 62xxxxx
Santa Cruz ——3xxxxxx
Tarija —— 66xxxxx
Trinidad (Beni)— 46xxxxx

, There are only three regions in Bolivia and each region corresponds to three departments. The codes are as follows:


La Paz, Oruro, Potosí : 2
Santa Cruz, Benia, Pando : 3
Cochabamba, Sucre, Tarija: 4

, The code for Bolivia is 591. You will have to dial 011 for international calls, then the region code (2, 3, or 4) according to the list and then the city code. For example, to call Cochabamba the number would be 011-591-4-4xxxxxx

, If you are calling with a card or by automated operator services, you won't need this step. The long-distance operator number is a number of one or two digits that identify each of the long-distance telephone companies. Select the carrier of your choice and get their number.
 The result will be 011 - yy 591 - r - xxxxxxx, where yy is the external operator number, r the region code, and xxxxxxx the number of the place you want to call.
 For this, you simply need to introduce the preceding number without the long distance carrier code.
 The region code is 7. A 7-digit cell phone number may begin with 9. If using an automatic operator, dial 011-591-7-xxxxxxx.

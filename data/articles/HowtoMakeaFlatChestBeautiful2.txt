 Opt for pastels and other light colors, especially across the bust. Dark colors have a slimming effect, which could make your chest look smaller.
 Horizontal stripes have a widening effect, which often helps small chests look fuller.
 This further intensifies the effect of the stripes. The same principle can be applied to other patterns, as well. Match a pattern over your bust with a solid color covering your stomach.
 Try a few different patterns on and determine what suits your body and your personality best.

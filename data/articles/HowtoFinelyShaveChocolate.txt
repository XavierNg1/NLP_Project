 Purchase a very fine grater; the best sort is a "microplane" that is specifically made for grating chocolate. You can find these at stores selling chocolate making supplies, as well as at good kitchenware stores.


It is important to look for a blade that is stainless steel, with tiny razor-sharp holes.
Check that it is comfortable to hold.;
, A silicone mat, wooden board or plastic board are ideal work surfaces.
 The sharp holes will do the work easily and reduce the chocolate to fine shavings.


Be careful when holding the chocolate against the grater. As your fingers get closer to the grater when the chocolate thins, keep them away from the sharp holes and don't try to grate the last thin pieces or you might catch your fingers too.
 A peeler won't create fine shavings; these will be more like "medium" shavings. Simply hold the chocolate firmly in place on a non-slip surface and peel down the edge of the chocolate. The shavings will start to peel off.
 This is a nifty invention that allows you to put chocolate chunks or chips into a mill and simply turn the crank for fine flakes.Look for one made from stainless steel and that is easy to take apart and clean.

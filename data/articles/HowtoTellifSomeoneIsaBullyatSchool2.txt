 It does sound clich√©, and you've been hearing this advice for all your school life, but it's valid advice. Remember, this is the only way you can win with bullying.


If you know that the bullying will get worse if you tell someone, be sure to consider this and tell someone again straight away if the bully continues. If your school has a bad bullying system, then always confide in your parents. If the bullying gets bad enough, you and your parents might consider leaving the school.
Ask for help of an adult if you are being bullied. An adult can help you to fight them or can help you to complain.
 Don't be a mouse; this is what the bully wants. If the bully insults you, tell them firmly to stop it, because if it continues you will go to a teacher.
 Never let bullies put you down.
 This works best when the bully is attention-seeking. Ignoring also might work, but not to the extent that you ignore the whole situation entirely.
 If the bully harasses you, speak up. Try asking him or her to stop his or her behavior.

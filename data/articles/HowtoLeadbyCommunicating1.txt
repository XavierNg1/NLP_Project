 Get into your field of endeavor at school, plant or the office—not spying, looking/watching from a distance—losing opportunities because you are off the front lines of work, play or school. While your team, technicians, producers, sales force are in action, be out there communicating. Be an "enthusiast/cheerleader" if that might work. Continually engage the entire collection of teams—at each level, bottom to top.
 Pump customer service for their input on business through the customers' eyes. Prime the office-mates, warehouse-men, and others—individually and in groups, communicating together. Tune in to ideas and build on them.


Relational management builds relationships: synergistic energies/connections with minds and emotions of the employees. It primes the feeling of loyalty to the business and a vestment in the desire to improve the processes and mechanisms. Individuals tend to be more accountable to the management with whom they have relationships beyond just their daily work duties, particularly when the individuals are fully-valued.
 Listen to what your coworkers are seeing in their part of the work, school or game. Listen to what they are thinking and analyze thoughts with a high level of empathy.


Learn what is happening out there in the trenches! What was or is each of the other team or company marketers doing that you could latch on to and extend as well? What trends, strengths and weaknesses does each man see in the competition?
Try "walking the floor", discussing in classrooms or patrolling the practice field where you can learn from the employees on the line what really is going on and how to improve things.

 By fifth grade your teacher probably expects you to take notes. You should have a math notebook. If you don’t, ask your parents to buy one for you. In your notebook you should write down definitions and sample problems your teacher shows you. You can also write notes out of your textbook.

Your notes can help you do homework when your teacher is not around to help. It can also help you study for a test.
 Your school probably gave you an agenda or planner. If you didn’t get one, or you lost yours, ask your parents or teacher to get you a new one. Use your agenda to keep track of your assignments.

Even if your teacher doesn’t check your agenda every day, write down your math homework. This way, when you get home, you can remember what you are supposed to do. 


, The best way to be good at math is to do your work. Your classwork and homework are supposed to help you get better. If you don’t understand how to do something, your teacher will see it in your work. Then, your teacher can give you more help with the topics you don’t understand.

Completing all of your work will also help you get a good grade in math. Even a few missed assignments can hurt your grade. In fifth grade, the most important thing is that you do your work. Teachers usually give you full credit for assignments if you try your best. If you don’t turn in your work at all, you won’t earn any points.
 A messy desk can cause you to lose your work. If you find an assignment in the back of your desk weeks after it was due, your teacher probably will not accept it. Keep all of your work for all subjects in separate folders.

You should have a folder that is just for math work. Keep your classwork and graded work in this folder.

You should also have a folder that is just for homework. When you complete your homework, put it in your homework folder. Put your homework folder in your bookbag right away. This way, you won’t forget to take it to school the next day.

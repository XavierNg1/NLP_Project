 This is obviously the most desirable option but not always possible. However, people do change over time and, with time and effort, you can work on helping the relationship to evolve successfully too.;
, Explain to them what they are doing wrong, and what needs to change in order for the relationship to work. Let them know that they need to be more supportive, and that you're not trying to change the person but how the relationship works. Your partner doesn't want to feel like you're trying to change them; if they do, that will make the whole the situation feel like an even bigger disaster.
 That way, it's not just you complaining about all they wrong they're doing, as if you're so perfect. Ask them what else you could bring to the table to make the relationship grow. Listen attentively.
 This is also important. Be there for each other, showing how much you care, demonstrating your love through consistent actions. Last but not least, continue to go out of your way to help the person grow.
 Here is a list of indicators that suggest it is better to end the relationship than to keep tending to it:


When the relationship brings you more pain than joy.
When you feel constantly alone, unheard, and disrespected.
When you stop having fun as a couple and it only seems like all hard work.
When you lose sight of who you are.
When you're really unhappy and slightly or deeply depressed.
 If you're unable to change the relationship, then you can end it altogether. Ultimately, if a person is doing nothing but hurting you and causing you so much pain, then it is acceptable to end the relationship, for it is no longer working. Simply say something akin to: "This relationship is no longer right for me and I must move on."

, This is the best way to build meaningful relationships. A bad relationship teaches you what you don't want to deal with in your next relationship. Bad relationships are life lessons which then lead you to even better blessings within time.

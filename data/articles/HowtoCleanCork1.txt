 Vacuum or sweep your cork floors. Do this to remove any obvious layers of dirt or dust. That dirt can scratch the floor over time. Use a soft-bristled broom or a low setting on your vacuum., Combine a drop of mild dish soap with ¼ cup (60 mL) white vinegar and 1 quart (.946 L) of warm water. Put the solution in a spray bottle to apply it most easily to any surface. Mix it gently by rocking it back and forth or stirring gently. Don’t shake it or you’ll create unwanted suds.Don’t worry if you add a little extra soap.
You can also use a combination of liquid soap and water. Try combining 5 drops of soap to every quart (.946 L) of water.
 Try using a gently abrasive cleaning solution. Watch out for cleansers that contain bleach. These can discolor your cork. Also avoid acidic cleansers that might damage your cork., Use a soft mop to wash the floor with store-bought cleansers, soap and water, or your solution of water, vinegar, and soap. Rinse off the cleaning solution or you might see streaks or a soapy film when the floor is dry. Allow the floor to air dry or dry it with a soft rag.Wring out any extra water when you begin mopping to avoid over-saturating the floor. This extra water could damage the cork.

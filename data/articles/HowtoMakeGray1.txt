 Combining black and white will result in a color known as "neutral gray."Neutral gray is the purest type of gray you can create because it has no other tint or hue.
Equal parts of black and white should create a mid-tone gray. Vary the shade by adding more of either color. More black creates a darker gray, and more white creates a lighter gray.;
, Mixing two complementary colors will result in a color classified as "complementary gray."


The basic color complements are:

Red and green
Yellow and purple
Blue and orange


Combining equal parts of any two complements will result in a flat gray,but you can give the gray a slight tint by adding more of one color than the other. Adding more red, yellow, or orange will result in a "warm" gray, but adding more green, purple, or blue should result in a "cool" gray.
 When you combine all three primary colors, the resulting color can be called "primary gray."


The three primary colors are red, blue, and yellow.
Mixing equal parts should produce a flat gray, but you can create tints by using more or less of certain colors. Using more blue should result in a cooler tone, but using more red or yellow without additional blue can create warmer tones.

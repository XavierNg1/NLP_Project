 Before choosing a course of study, think about what type of job you would like to have. Much climatology work done today focuses on climate change science, and involves developing models to predict future climate trends.


One area of specialization, paleoclimatology, studies how climates have changed over time, which helps us to better understand current climate trends.If you’d prefer to do research, plan to stay in school long enough to get a doctorate.
 Courses related to climatology are offered through a variety of academic departments. Most of these fall under the heading of the atmospheric sciences, of which climatology is a branch.University academic departments that offer studies in climatology-related subjects include departments of Earth System Science,Environmental Science,Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences,and Meteorology and Atmospheric Science.Other areas of study that can prepare you for work as a climatologist include physics, geology, chemistry,computer science, and geography., Before you choose a school, it will be necessary to find a course of study that can train you for the field you want to work in. Call academic departments to ask whether the coursework offered through their majors is meant to train students for particular types of work.
 When deciding where to pursue studies in atmospheric science, take into account the department’s reputation,and whether it offers courses related to the branch of climatology you’d like to work in. On the department’s website, look for information on internships as well, since this will be an important part of your professional development.


Use the following resources to search for an academic department in the atmospheric sciences: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Library,and the American Meteorological Society's Colleges and Universities Index.To get a sense of a department’s strengths and emphases, call the department to ask about where recent graduates have found work.

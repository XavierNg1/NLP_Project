 Open a new browser window by clicking on the Safari icon that’s either on your desktop or on the taskbar.;
, Once you have a Safari window up, click on the icon that looks like a small gear box at the top-right side of the screen. This will bring up a drop-down menu, and from the options displayed, select “Preferences” to open Settings.
 This new window contains different settings, and running across the top of the screen is a list of submenus. Among those, look for “Security,” the one sporting a lock with black and yellow stripes, and click on it.
 Your screen should now display a list of settings that you can tweak and adjust by checking and unchecking their corresponding tickboxes. The first setting will allow Safari to warn you when you’re about to access a fraudulent site. Make sure you have this one marked with a check for the sake of your account’s security.
 The second through the fifth check boxes pertain to the four options that let you control what is allowed with your web content: Enable Plugins, Enable Java, Enable Javascript, and Block Pop-up Windows.


You are free to uncheck them if you do not want them working with your browser. However, unchecking some or all of these four options may mean having to sacrifice some of your browser’s capabilities, such as viewing videos, for example.
 This last setting can enable Safari to ask you first before sending a non-secure form to a secure website. This is useful for when you sign up at a website, or when you enter sensitive information online such as your bank account details.


It is recommended that you check this option.
 Once you’re satisfied with the adjustments you made on your browser’s Security Settings, you can just exit the Preference window as your preferences are automatically saved.

 You just need a standard deck of cards that comes in a cardboard box. Remove the cards from the box and use a scissors to snip a small hole in one of the corners of the back of the box. Put the cards back in the box and take a look at the hole. You should be able to see the upper corner of the last card in the deck, revealing which card it is.


Come to your show with the card box already prepared. Keep the side with the hole away from the audience as you prepare to perform the trick.
If you can find a box that has a picture of a playing card printed on it, as many standard decks do, all the better - the hole will barely be visible.
 Start by having the person shuffle the cards a few times. Tell him or her to pick a card and show it to the audience while your back is turned, then place it at the bottom of the deck of cards. Hold out the box of cards, hole side facing your palm, and tell the person to put the cards into the box.


He or she will almost certainly place the cards into the box face down so that you won't be able to see the chosen card. If not, tell him or her to start over and pick a new card.
 Hold up the deck of cards, with the hole facing you, and announce that you're reading the volunteer's mind to determine what he or she picked. Look through the hole to see what the card is, then close your eyes and tilt your head toward the ceiling. Announce, I've got it! State the name of the card.
 Pull the deck of cards from the box, taking care not to show the side with the hole, and hold it up to the audience so that they can see the bottom card.

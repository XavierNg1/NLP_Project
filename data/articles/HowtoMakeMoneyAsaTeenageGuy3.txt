 People with pets need someone to watch their pet when they are out of town. Paying a pet hotel costs big bucks, and half the time the pet comes home with kennel cough.


Some animals, like dogs, you might need to watch at your own place. Obviously you would need your parents' permission.
Cats or fish, you can watch at their place. You can just stop by after school, put out some food, maybe water the plants.
 Senior citizens often need help with these basic tasks.

 Take two medium ripe bananas and slice them into small pieces. You can cut them as small or as large as you'd like, but smaller pieces work better when you add it to the cream mixture.
 Pour 2.5 cups of milk into a large mixing bowl. Slowly add two packages of JELL-O Vanilla Flavor Instant Pudding to the milk, stirring as you pour.Note: You can use fat free milk and sugar free/fat free instant pudding to reduce calories.
 Whisk the cream mixture for about two minutes, or until all clumps are eliminated. Your mixture should be well-blended when you finish whisking.
 Slowly fold one cup of whipped topping into the cream mixture. Make sure you keep stirring as you add the whipped topping, so that no lumps appear.
 Combine the bananas with the cream mixture and mix well. Use your whisk to stir out any remaining lumps that might exist in the cream mixture.
 Once you finish, make sure you put the final product in the refrigerator, otherwise the pectin in the Jello-O won't set. Let it stand in the refrigerator for at least an hour. Then, you can eat the mixture as it is or go on to make a pie. You can also serve it over sweet biscuits

Note: Make sure you refrigerate any leftovers.

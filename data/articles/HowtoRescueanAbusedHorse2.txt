 Even well cared for horses pick up parasites from eating in the pasture, so they require regular deworming (regular means two to four times a year). It is likely that the neglected horse has not been wormed, and there is a good chance that the horse was placed in a pasture where worm eggs were in abundance.


Worms can cause a number of health problems so it is important to get them treated as soon as possible. The worms irritate the gut lining causing pain and diarrhea. They interfere with digestion and rob the horse of vital nutrients. In extreme cases the sheer number of worms physically blocks the gut causing impactions or colic.
 There are many different types of worms. To ensure the worms die, treat the horse with the appropriate wormer. To determine which wormer should be used, the vet will take a fecal sample for analysis to find out exactly which species of worms are present. The common parasite species and the problems they cause are:


Strongyles (large red worms): These worms cause lethargy, ill thrift, and colic.
Cyathastomes (small red worms): These worms hibernate in the lining of the bowel. They can cause severe damage when they migrate and may cause pain or colic.
Cestodes (tapeworm): These absorb nutrition from the gut and robs the horse of precious nutrients.
Dictyocaulus (lungworm): The presence of worms in the horseâ€™s lungs can cause a cough and secondary lung infections.
Ascarids (roundworms): Although these are intestinal worms, they can cause a cough due to larval migration through the lungs. These are mostly a problem in foals and young horses.
Oxyuris (pinworm): These irritate the anus.
Gastrophilus (bots): These are not a worm but fly larvae. They can cause irritation, inflammation, and pain in the stomach.
 Once the type of worms plaguing your horse have been determined, you will have to get medication for your horse to get rid of the worms.


Ivermectin or moxidectin are two common deworming medications.

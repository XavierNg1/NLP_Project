;
, You can combine colours if you're dealing with more than one disorder (for example, if you're dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts, make your bracelet half blue and half yellow).


If you are trying to recover, add a white bead.
 The rules are if you see a person wearing the same coloured one as you, make eye contact and point to your bracelet. If the person nods, they are part of the Bracelet Project.

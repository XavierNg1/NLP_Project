 Open a blank PowerPoint document. While not as flexible as a full-fledged graphics editor such as Photoshop, PowerPoint is a very capable application.
 The default layout is landscape, but since posters are usually portrait, let's go ahead and change this.
 The default layout is usually just a title and subtitle, but other options include a title with an image, a title and two images, and blank. This example uses the picture with caption layout.
 PowerPoint has ready-made themes that can be used as-is, or customized.


If you donâ€™t like the themes available, more are available online. Note that you can also use a theme as a template and then heavily modify it.
 Click within the content boxes to add images, charts, or even drawing boxes for you to draw inside.


If you're adding a photo, browse to a saved photo on your computer and click Okay or Insert.
 Click in the appropriate box and add text. Don't forget, this is a key selling feature, so make your title catchy, big, and bold.
 Click in the appropriate box (or insert a new text box) and add text. Keep it clear and concise but convey as much of the important information as you can, including details, what, when, and where.
 Edit text, adjust the font size or spacing, change colors, sizes, or borders, etc. Print the completed poster!

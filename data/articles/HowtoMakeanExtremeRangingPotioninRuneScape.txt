Create a super ranging potion. For this, you will need a dwarf weed herb, a Wine of Zamorak, and a vial of water.






Collect five Grenwall spikes. They can be obtained by purchasing them at the Grand Exchange or by trapping Grenwall using pawya meat and box traps (if the player has a hunter level of 77).
 This will create a three dose extreme ranging potion.


Be sure to click on the herb first, then the potion. Clicking on the potion first will accidentally consume a dose.

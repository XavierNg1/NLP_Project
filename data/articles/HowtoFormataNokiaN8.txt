 Formatting will delete all data both on the N8’s local storage and its memory card. So create a backup by copying any content you have on the phone to a computer.;
, Make sure that your Nokia N8 has at least half the battery level left before you format it to avoid interrupting the process.


If your phone is already low on power, charge it before formatting.
 Press the “Call” button on the lower right corner of the home screen to access its on-screen keypad.
 This is a special code used to format phones that runs on the Symbian OS.


After entering the code, you’ll be asked to enter an unlock key.
 If you haven’t set one yet, you can use the default lock code, which is 12345.
 Your Nokia N8 will restart right after you’ve entered the unlock code. Once it restarts, it will begin formatting on its own. Simply wait for the process to complete.
 Since formatting wipes out all the data on your Nokia N8, including the applications, you have to reinstall all downloaded applications you had. On the the other hand, any default third-party installed applications on your phone that came with it will not be affected.

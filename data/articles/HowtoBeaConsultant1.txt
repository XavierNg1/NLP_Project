 This may be the first impression an employer gets of you, so don’t cut corners. Now that you have the skills and requirements to make a splash in your particular field, make sure your resume explains why you’re the right person for the job.


Have a clearly defined goal
List your employment history. Don’t sell yourself short here or take anything for granted, you never know what you’ve done that an employer might find interesting or worthwhile.
List awards or other achievements. If you don’t have an extensive work history, you can lead with educational achievements, contests won, or community service/outreach you’ve had experience with
Overall, be clear, concise and check dutifully for any spelling or grammatical errors.;
, Never underestimate the power of a good reference. Understanding who to use and why is a strategy that could be just as helpful as your air-tight resume.


List someone you’ve worked with. Most employers will want to know about your work style and attitude, so choose someone with whom you’ve had a positive working relationship.
List a professor. If you’re fresh out of school and haven’t had a chance to build a positive working relationship yet, you can select a professor or advisor from school that is familiar with you and your work.
Select people who want to see you succeed as much as you do.
Make sure they know enough about you so that they express your strengths, areas of expertise, and development.
Overall, make sure that it’s someone you feel good about having as a reference. , Even with a good education, a shining resume, and a list of the world’s best references, it can be difficult to land a job. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re doing something wrong. It means that there’s a lot of competition out there. Don’t give up if employers don’t respond to your resume right away. Keep looking, learn from your experiences, and have confidence in your abilities.

 One of the easiest ways to determine if a nail polish is toxic is by consulting the Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database at http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/. Enter the polish into the site’s search bar, and it will return a toxicity rating of 1-10 based on the nail polish’s ingredients., After you enter a nail polish into the Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database, the product will receive a toxicity rating. Aim for nail polishes that receive a low score of 1-2, which are the least toxic. You can also opt for a polish with a moderate hazard score of 3-6, although these polishes are more toxic., If you enter a nail polish into the Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database and it returns a score of 7 or above, you should exercise caution when using this product. Nail polishes with a high hazard score of 7 or above can be toxic.

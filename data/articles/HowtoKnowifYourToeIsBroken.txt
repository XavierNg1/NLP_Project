 If your toe is fractured, it's going to hurt when you put your weight on it, or when pressed on. You will probably still be able to walk, but moving around might make the pain worse. The presence of pain does not necessarily mean that the toe is broken, but persistent pain can be an indication of a fracture or break.If putting weight on your toe is excruciatingly painful, you might have a bad break. In this case, you should see a doctor right away. Minor fractures aren't as painful, and may not need medical treatment.
Tingling in addition to pain could indicate a fracture. See a doctor right away.;
, Is it swollen? This is a common indication that you might have a fracture. If you merely stub your toe badly, it will throb for awhile and then the pain will go away without swelling occurring. A fractured toe is very likely to swell.

When you're at home, keep your foot elevated to help with swelling.
After several weeks of healing, gradually begin using your toe again, but don't overdo it. If you feel pain or stress, take a step back and rest your foot.
 Most toe fractures and breaks do not require a cast; instead, the doctor will show you how to "buddy tape" your broken toe to the toe next to it. This keeps it from wandering out of place and getting reinjured. Ask your doctor or a nurse to show you how to properly change the tape and gauze every few days to keep the area clean.

If you lose feeling in the taped toes or they change in color, the tape is probably too tight. Remove it immediately. Ask your doctor for guidance in reapplying the tape.
Diabetics should not tape their toes. Instead, special flat-footed orthopedic shoes should be worn, as prescribed by your doctor., If your break is severe enough to require a cast, brace, or special walking shoes, you'll probably have to rest it completely for 6 to 8 weeks. Breaks that require surgery may have even longer healing periods. You may need to have several doctor's visits in the meantime to make sure it's healing properly.

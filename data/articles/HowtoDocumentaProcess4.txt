 Each time the process moves from one person or team to another, consider whether someone should examine the work in progress to see if it is ready to continue. Is quality often sub-par after a specific step, such as a step usually performed by an inexperienced team member? Which processes have the highest overall effect on quality, and might need extra attention?


If you do decide to recommend a quality review step in this process, make the criteria for "advancement" to the next stage clear. Don't leave people guessing what quality standards are in use.
 If your diagram or document contains two identical tasks, consider whether this is useful or inefficient. Sometimes, it's good to repeat a task for better quality control (for instance, two departments inspecting a product at different stages). However, simple tasks such as proofreading shouldn't occur more than once in the process. Suggest that one of the duplicate steps be removed from the process procedure.
 Your document might show that person A and person B transfers responsibility for the process back and forth several times. Is it possible to reduce the amount of unnecessary transfers? If you can reorganize the process, person A might be able to do several tasks in one period, then hand it to person B.

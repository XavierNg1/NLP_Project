 Fill a jar halfway with water, then dissolve several spoonfuls of alum in the water. Continue adding alum until no more will dissolve.


You may also use salt or borax instead of alum.
If you would like to make ornaments in several different colors, divide the solution among more than one jar.
 Add a few drops of red, blue, yellow, green, or any color of your choice to the solution in the jar. If you prepared several jars of solution, add different colored drops to each jar.


Mix different drops of food coloring to make a unique color. For example, combine 4 drops of yellow with one drop of blue to make a pale green color, or mix red and blue to make purple.
For festive holiday ornaments, dye the solutions colors that match your holiday decorations.
 Shape them into trees, stars, snowflakes, pumpkins, or any other shape you'd like to make. Make the shapes clear and recognizable, keeping in mind that the pipe cleaners will be covered with crystals, so the outlines of the different shapes will be thick.
 Submerge the shaped part of the each pipe cleaner in the jar so that the shape is suspended in the center of the jar, not touching the sides or bottom. Hook the other end of the pipe cleaner over the edge of the jar, bending it a little to keep it in place.


If you have jars with solution dyed more than one color, choose colors that match the shapes you created with the pipe cleaner. For example, if you made a tree pipe cleaner you could suspend it in a jar with green solution.
If you suspend more than one pipe cleaner in the same jar, don't let them touch each other.
 Let the pipe cleaners sit in the jar or jars for a week or two, until you like the size of the crystals. When you're satisfied with the way they look, remove your new crystal ornaments from the jars. Pat them dry with paper towels. The ornaments are now ready to hang.

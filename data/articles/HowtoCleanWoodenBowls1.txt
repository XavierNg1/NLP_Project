 Grab a soft washcloth or a soft sponge and put a few drops of mild dish soap on it. Soak the cloth or sponge with hot water and wipe the bowl down thoroughly inside and outside. In the process, don’t submerge or soak the bowl in the water.Wooden bowls absorb water easily, which is why you shouldn’t soak or submerge them. It’s important, for the same reason, that you never put wooden bowls in the dishwasher.
Don’t use a scrubbing pad or steel wool unless your bowl has a tough buildup. Soft cloths and sponges are enough for basic cleaning.;
, After a quick but thorough wash, rinse the entire bowel with hot water. Be sure not to submerge the bowl in the water when you rinse it. It’s important to get all of the soap off of the bowl so it doesn’t get scummy.Try to rinse the bowl in about five seconds rather than letting it linger in the running water.
 Wipe the entire bowl down with a clean, dry towel to remove as much of the moisture as you can. Because wood retains water easily, you will not be able to get it completely dry with a towel. Just make sure that it is only slightly damp when you finish.It may help to press the towel into the bowls more than you would when drying other materials. The pressure will draw some of the moisture out.
 After drying the bowl with a towel, put the bowl in a drying rack and allow it to sit until it is completely dry. You may need to let the bowl sit overnight to dry completely. Check the bowl after a few hours if you don’t want to leave it overnight.Don’t put a wooden bowl that is still wet into the cabinet, as this might keep it from drying completely and can ruin the bowl or cause mildew.

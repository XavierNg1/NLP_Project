 This will save time while cooking.


If you don't pre-heat the oven, add 5-10 minutes to the suggested baking time.
 If you don't have cooking spray, then cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
 Pat dry with a paper towel, and place them side-by-side on the baking dish.
 Spread evenly over the fillets using a basting brush if you have one.
 Add additional seasonings if desired.
 The fish should be white and flaky when pulled apart with a fork.
 Garnish with lemon slices or parsley if desired.

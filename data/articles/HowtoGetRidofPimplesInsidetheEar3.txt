 One of the most common reasons for ear pimples is lack of hygiene. Touching your ears with unwashed hands can transfer oil and bacteria to the skin, which clogs the pores and causes pimples., Make sure to keep the shell of your ear, your earlobes, and behind your ear cleaned. Shampoo, gel, and other hair products can get on the ear and cause pimples. Use soap and water and clean when you shower or wash your face and hair.Clean the inside of your ear when needed. Make sure to irrigate the ear with solution and don't use cotton swabs inside your ear., Wipe your ear after every shower. This is when the pores are slightly open, so you can remove excess oil and help reduce blackheads., Another common way of getting ear pimples is through the telephone. Wipe down your cell phone after use. It is especially important to wipe down a telephone if you share it with other people., Since earbuds go into your ears, they can get caked with oil, earwax, and other dirt and grime. When earbuds are out of your ear, they can pick up dirt and other contaminants. When you place them back in your ears, that stuff transfers. Use an alcohol wipe to clean your earbuds after each use.If the pimple is in your external ear, don't use earphones until it is gone. This will aggravate the pimple. Wipe over it with an anti-bacterial wipe, since the pimple could return if your earphones are dirty.
 If you get ear acne often, your ear is covered with black dots, or you have a zit that is draining fluid, you need to see your doctor. You also should see a doctor if your ear blemish is very painful and lasts longer than a week. They can give you something to help clear it up and determine if the underlying cause is hormonal.

 You can not create an Album via the Facebook App. Go to Facebook.com on your Browser.


Your Browser will automatically try to take you to the Mobile Site, m.Facebook.com, like shown in the picture. You will have to be in Desktop Mode to create an Album. To do this, click the three line button in the top left corner of the screen.;
, This will open the side panel. Scroll down to the bottom of the side Panel.
 Allow the page to load.
 It should have www.facebook.com, NOT m.Facebook.com. Once you are on the Desktop Site, scroll down/zoom and click the Kitsap County Buy Sell Trade page to open it.
 Scroll/zoom so you can click on the "Photo" tab under the Kitsap County BST banner.
 It might take a few minutes, so be patient. Once it is loaded, click the "+Upload Photos" button.


This page will pop up. The Admins are VERY specific about what they want the title of your Album to be! DO NOT JUST CLICK CREATE ALBUM! The next image shows how your album SHOULD be labeled!
1. YOUR name. 2. The current or upcoming Month/Date. 3. Your location. NOW you can click "Create Album".
 If you see another pop up uploader, scroll down to click on the link that says something along the lines of "switch to Simple Uploader", etc. Click on the "Choose File" button.
 Either Take Photo, or Choose Existing from your Photo Library.
 I suggest only uploading ONE photo at a time, depending on your WIFI abilities. If you choose to upload 5 photos at a time, the page may crash and not upload any of them. You can repeat this step again and again to upload additional photos. Once your photo has attached, click the "Upload Photos" button, highlighted by the Red Arrow.
 Click the button the Yellow Arrow is indicating.
, Now you can access your Album via your Safari Browser at any time by going to your Bookmarks.
 Make sure you are on YOUR album page, just click the "Add Photos" Button that the Green Arrow is indicating, then repeat steps 10, 11, and 12.

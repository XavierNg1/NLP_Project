 If you rarely speak to your best friend's sister, it's not a good idea to walk up to her and start a huge conversation as if you've known her for years. Instead, when you're with your best friend and their sister walks by, just politely say hello to her.;
, Usually while you're over at a friend's house, their siblings will come interrupt you for one reason or another. Use this to your advantage. When your best friend's sister comes over to talk, don't just sit there silently. Talk to her as if she's a new friend. At first, keep the conversations short and sweet, and build on them as you go.
 If you see your friend's sister at school or out in public, acknowledge her and talk to her. Say hello and wave to her, and see if she wants to stop and talk to you. If she waves and keeps walking, don't follow her. However, if she stops or starts walking over to you, start a conversation with her.
 If you have accounts on websites such as Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, Formspring, etc., add her as a friend so that you can keep in touch. As long as you've talked to her enough so that she knows you, she should have no issues to adding you as a friend.
 Sometimes a best friend's sister can be so close to you that you feel like she's your sister too. If you have a problem and she is the type of person who'd be up to helping you, give her a call one day. Call her and have a nice conversation. If calling her is too weird, try texting her instead.
 If you start to feel more romantically attracted to her and want to get out of the friend zone, consider asking her out.

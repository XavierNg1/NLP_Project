 How much do you like the art piece? How big is it? How much did the materials cost? How much time did you spend on it?


Logically you don't price your artwork less than the materials cost.;
,,, Such as artwork based on how much the materials cost, how much it is liked, how big it is, and how much you need to sell it. For example - the materials for a painting cost $50 and it's a 36x24, so you might price it at $300. Or it's a 16x20, and the materials cost $10, but you really like the painting, so maybe price it at $250.
 You're most likely just starting out if you're reading this. If you're just starting out you would price your artwork lower than you would if you had been around for a while and made a name for yourself. For example - when just starting out you may charge $60 or $80 for a 16x20, but five years later after you've had art shows, etc., you could probably charge $300 for the same size. Of course, your quality of work will improve over this time as well.

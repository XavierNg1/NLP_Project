 Graco makes many different models of strollers, but they usually advertise their most easily collapsed strollers by referring to "one-hand-fold" or "FastAction" features. If you know your stroller's model number, look it up online to see if these features are mentioned. If you do not know the model number, you should be able to see whether this method works with no more than a minute or two of effort.
 Graco SnugRider stroller frames are made for use with car seats, and do not have seats of their own. Unstrap the car seat from the frame and remove it before attempting to fold the stroller frame.
 The canopy over the seat, if present, should easily collapse back against the upper handles when you tug the front end backward.
 Graco strollers with the one-hand-fold feature fold so the seat surfaces end up on the outside of the folded stroller. These models typically have a strap beneath where a child would sit, which can be tugged to fold the stroller.Strollers that fold outward may not lock the tray into position while they do so. Remove the tray first to avoid it falling onto the ground and getting scratched or dirty., If the stroller has become rusty or dirty, it may take more force to fold. Attempt to tug it again, with slightly more force, but do not exert yourself too much or brace yourself against another surface for more force. If these methods do not work relatively easily, try the instructions for folding older models.

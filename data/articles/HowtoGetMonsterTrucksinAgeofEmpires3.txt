 You can buy it at a store, but make sure that it "fits" with your computer. For example, you do not want to buy a CD that is formulated for Mac if you have a Windows computer.;
, Don't just put the CD in. You will have to load it in order to get monster trucks.
 Once you get onto the main menu, try a game. You might want to set the difficulty to medium or hard so that it will be fun, and funny.
 Type in "tuck tuck tuck" (without the " signs) in the chat box.
 You should be able to find the chat box. If you can't find the chat box, find the bubble on the left of your screen, and click on it.
, Use your monster truck to defeat your enemies when they have a low military. You can even get an army of monster trucks. It will end the game faster though.

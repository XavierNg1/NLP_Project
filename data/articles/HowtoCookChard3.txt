While the water is boiling, make sure that the tough bottoms of your chard stems are removed., Once the water has reached a rapid boil, add your prepared chard leaves.Do not put a lid on top of the pot, you are boiling the chard rather than steaming it., Cook the chard in boiling water for three minutes.You can stir or press the chard down to make sure that it cooks evenly. It should cook down and turn dark green when it is about ready., Use a colander to strain and press out excess water from the chard.There should be a fair amount of excess water so be sure to do this thoroughly., Chard has dozens of uses in various recipes, but if you are planning to serve the chard on its own, be sure to serve it quickly. It is best when warm and fresh. Toss it with butter, lemon, parmesan cheese, or whatever other spices you wanted to use and serve it while it is still hot.

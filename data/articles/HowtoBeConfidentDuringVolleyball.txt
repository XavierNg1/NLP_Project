 People would let you know if you were not very good. Also, realize that if you auditioned for a team and made it, it's not because of luck, it's because of talent.;
, For example, if you aren't very good at spiking, don't try to do that at all. If you're good at bumping, try to do that more during play. You are more likely to get the ball over more if you do what your good at.
 Take the example above, get a parent, guardian, or even a neighbor to help you. If you don't feel comfortable asking them, tell your coach. Maybe they willÂ help with some one-on-one time with you. After all, they are the expert. Eventually, you will get better!

, A team is nothing if they don't come together and are there for one another. Celebrate your wins, but don't give someone the death glare if they miss. It happens to the best of them! Say something like, "Shake it off", or, "It's OK! We'll get 'em next time!" Just treat them like you would want to be treated if you missed the ball.
 We all make them! Just look at the best player on the team. They most likely miss just as much as you or anyone else does. It is natural to think your mistakes stand out so much that you become consumed with grief that and cannot bounce back!

, Miss a huge, game winning point? Stop and think, does it matter? No, not in the long run. How many times have your team mates missed the ball? You are not alone. Get back on your feet, and spike the ball!

, Telling your teammates about your weaknesses allows them to know not to give the ball to you for certain hits throughout the game. However, this isn't a confess-it-all showdown. Just say something along the lines of: "Hey guys, I would prefer it if you didn't set it up to me as much. I am more of a setter-upper myself."

, It is just a game.
 It makes everything better!

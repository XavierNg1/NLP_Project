 Some filter programs only block websites by their hostname, and not the IP address. By entering the IP address instead of the website name, you can bypass these blocks. This will not work for all web filtering programs.


Open the Command Prompt in Windows by pressing âŠž Win+R and typing cmd. Open the Terminal in Mac in the Utilities subfolder of the Applications folder.
Type ping address. For example, if you wanted to find wikiHow's IP address, you would type ping www.wikihow.com.
Note the IP address that is returned when the ping is complete.
 Enter the address into your browser's address bar and load the site. If the filter software doesn't block IP addresses, the site will be displayed.

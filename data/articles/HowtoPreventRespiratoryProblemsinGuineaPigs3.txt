 Vitamin C is an important nutrient for guinea pigs. Guinea pigs cannot produce vitamin C in their bodies, so they must obtain it through their diet. Feed your guinea pigs vitamin C-rich foods like oranges, broccoli, and leafy greens (e.g., kale, parsley, spinach). You can also feed them Vitamin C-fortified pellets.Vitamin C in pellets can break down quickly. Check the milling date (processing date) on the package. Feed the pellets within 90 days of the milling date to ensure your guinea pigs get enough vitamin C from the pellets.You could put vitamin C drops in your guinea pigs' water bottle. However, vitamin C breaks down very quickly in water. Plus, the drops could make the water taste bad.A guinea pig needs at least 50 milligrams of vitamin C each day to stay healthy.Without enough vitamin C, a guinea pig’s immune system could weaken., Your good hygiene can prevent respiratory problems in guinea pigs. If you have multiple guinea pigs, wash your hands between handling each one.This is especially important if one of your guinea pigs is sick.
 Dental problems can lead to respiratory problems in guinea pigs. For example, the tooth roots (located above the gum line) of a guinea pig’s cheek teeth are fairly close to the nasal airways.If these roots get pushed upward because of another dental problem, a guinea pig could develop respiratory problems, like a sinus infection.


Dental problems require veterinary treatment, such as surgery and antibiotics.

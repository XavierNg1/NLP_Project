 Down-Tilt is a perfect move when guarding the edge from your opponents grasp. Use right before the opponent tries to grab the edge.
 Forward smash has an enormous range. Because of this, It can be used to overpower an enemy's recovery.
 Do this by hitting with the tip. Do not use this move off the stage because it has tons of after-move lag, and you could fall to your death. However, it is possible to jump from the ledge onto the stage and down air at the same time, spiking and opponent who tries to grab it after you.
 To do this, just grab the ledge as the opponent tries to do so. Usually, the best way to do this is with a well placed wavedash. Since only one character can grab the ledge, they will fall to their deaths if you are holding it unless they can make it back onto the stage or knock you off it. When you first grab the ledge or roll onto the stage, you are temporarily invincible so use that time to absorb the recovery attack of your opponent.

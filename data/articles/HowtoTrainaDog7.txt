 Get some food treats or a toy and find your dog. Hold the toy or treat in view so he focuses on you.
 Do this by moving the toy or treat onto the ground in front of the dog, between his front legs. His head should follow it, and his body should follow shortly thereafter.
 When the dog’s stomach is on the ground, lavish him with praise and give him the treat or toy. Be accurate with your praise, too. If you praise him halfway down or up, that is the behavior you will get.
 Once he’s learned the behavior with the promise of a treat below him, move a little farther away. The hand signal for “down” will become your flat hand — palm down — moving in a downward direction from in front of your waist to your side.


As the dog gets more consistent with the "down" behavior, add a verbal “down” or “lie down” command.
Always praise him immediately when his belly is on the ground.
Dogs read body language well and learn hand signals quite quickly.
 As he gets more reliable with “down,” pause a few seconds before praising and treating to encourage him to hold the position.


If he pops up to get the treat, do not give it to him, or you will be rewarding the last behavior he did before the treat.
Just start again, and the dog will understand that you want him all the way down on the ground, as long as you are consistent.
 Once your dog has caught onto the command, stand up straight when giving it. If you loom over him, you'll have a dog that only lays down when you are leaning over him. You want to work on being able to get your dog to lie down from across the room, eventually.

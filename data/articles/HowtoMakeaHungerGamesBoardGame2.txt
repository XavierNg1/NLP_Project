 Any size paper will work, but it's recommended to use a large piece of paper (ie. 11x17" or larger) in order to avoid a cramped playing area., Using a pencil, draw a pathway that goes from the edges of your map and spirals around into the center. Because the point of the game isn't to reach the end of the pathway, make your pathway circular so that there is no start or end and players can continue moving around as much as possible., To make things more complex, you can draw "bridges" that link together different parts of your pathway and create many different ways to get to the same place. From there, divide your pathway up into individual spaces of about 1 inch that each player will land on during their turn., In the center of your map, draw the Cornucopia. It plays an important role in the game, so make it fairly large so that it really stands out on the map and is easily visible for all the players., You can now add labels to certain spaces if you'd like. Because there is no specific "Start" and "End" points, you can label a few different spaces around the board as "Start" points, where players will begin the game. To keep things fair, ensure that your "Start" points are all equal distances away from other "Start" points as well as the Cornucopia. From there you can get creative and label other spaces with anything you'd like, for example "Invisible" (where you're safe from attack), "Miss a Turn", "Roll Again", etc., Once you're finished labeling your pathway and spaces, you can then get really creative and draw the terrain around the pathway. The way your map looks is up to you, but suggestions of terrain you could include are:

Desert
Forest
Ocean/islands
Tropical rainforest
Swamps
Abandoned city
Mountains

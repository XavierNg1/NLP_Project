 Pens use a wide variety of inks, some of which will break down and loosen with the simple application of water, and some of which will need heavy duty chemicals like the acetone used in nail polish removers to break down.


The list provided here moves from harshest to weakest chemical strength. Try each of these options until you find one that works on your ink.
Don’t apply these liquids directly to the page, as it will soak through and cause the paper to rip.
Instead, apply the liquids to either a Q-tip or a cotton ball, and transfer them gently to the page.
 Be careful not to apply enough pressure to rip the page. Continue rubbing and dabbing until the stain comes out.
 A ripped page is far more unsightly than one with a stray pen mark on it. By allowing the page to dry completely between attempts, you lessen the likelihood of ripping.
 While this will not “remove” the pen mark, it will cover it up. You can purchase white-out in the same aisle where you purchase pens. Simply apply a light coat using the brush attached to the lid of the bottle. Allow the liquid to dry before writing over it with pen again.
 Anyone who looks closely at the page will be able to see that there is corrective fluid on it. If it’s important that the page be smooth and clean, you should make a Xerox copy of the page after you’ve made your correction.


Note that for some official documents, especially those requiring signatures, a Xeroxed page may be unacceptable. Double-check to make sure.

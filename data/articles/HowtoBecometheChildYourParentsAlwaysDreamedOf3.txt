 You can make your parents proud by doing your absolutely best to get good grades in school, and staying out of trouble.Your academic achievement is one of a few things that will follow you all throughout your life, so it’s important that you take your education seriously.


Study for all of your quizzes, tests, and exams.
Don’t be ashamed to let your parents know if you’re struggling with school work and need a tutor.
Give yourself plenty of time to complete your assignments before the due date.
Be an example of a well-behaved student, and don’t allow peer pressure to steer you in the direction of risky behavior.
 Parents take great pride when you participate in team sports and activities that require dedication and commitment. Whether it is athletics, the marching band, the debate team, or volunteering in your community, parents are thrilled to come out to support you and even brag about your performance.
 Honoring your commitments, being trustworthy, taking care of things, finishing what you start and doing what you’re supposed to do is a delight to your parents and puts a smile on their face.


If you tell your parents that you are going to do something, make sure that you do it.
Be honest about where you’re going, what you will be doing, and who you are with.
Take responsibility for your actions. You are not perfect, and you will make mistakes. Don’t be afraid to apologize when you do something wrong that disappoints your parents.
Make sure that you take good care of the things that your parents give you or allow you to use. For example, if they buy you a car or loan you their car, don’t trash it.

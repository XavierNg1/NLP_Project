 A Heavy is spawned with 300 health, and when the Medic adds 150 health when over healing, it adds up to the highest amount of health possible in TF2, 450. They have the slowest speed but are deadlier than what meets the eye, as they are armed with a 200 bullet Minigun, a 6/32 Shotgun and their own bare fists.;
, Heavies are deadly enough as it is, but combine that power and the ÃœberCharge with each other, and you could destroy an entire Engineer camp.
 When it is clear that there are no enemies in your radius, recharge your ammo. It doesn't hurt to fall back once in a while either to recharge (a Heavy can wipe out entire camps and teams if they're clever enough, so that means they are the main targets, making it 20X easier for them to die).
 It's fun to punch some crotches, but this doesn't do much against 3 people with full ammunition, now, does it?

, You might be trapped in a corridor that is overflowing with enemies, so it doesn't really help to keep your Minigun spinning. Instead, listen out for weapons firing, footsteps and projectiles, and the moment you take a peek around the corner keep your finger on the right mouse button at all times.

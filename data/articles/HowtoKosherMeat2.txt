 It is okay to use the water in which you soaked the meat. Inspect the meat to make certain there is no visible blood.
 Keep the meat damp enough so salt sticks to it but not so wet the salt dissolves easily.
 Do not put so much salt on the meat that blood cannot drain out.
 Allow the blood to drain into a tub or basin. Do not allow the meat to be salted for more than 12 hours as this may make the meat unkosher.


If you leave salt on the meat for more than 12 hours, consult a rabbi as to whether the meat is still kosher.

 To help avoid getting addicted to Wikipedia, do not create an account and then write articles.;
, Start by limiting yourself to 1-2 hours every week. This can be helpful if you can buy a loud timer. You can go on it every day, but it it better to not go on it unnecessarily every day, or else you might be on the road to getting addicted to Wikipedia again.
 Once you are used to the idea that you are limited to Wikipedia, slowly reduce your time until somewhere like 5-10 minutes every 2 days.
 Take wikiHow for example. Wikipedia is very different from this site that you are currently on because Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, while wikiHow is a How-to manual. There are probably more than 2.5 million articles in English in that site. Try Youtube. You can watch short videos on that site.
 If you give up, that means you failed and you will have to go on that site over and over again. It is hard, but if you start to limit your time, it should be a little easier. In some people's beliefs, giving up is actually a sign of weakness.
 It could be the road to...you get the point, right? If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember what you said.

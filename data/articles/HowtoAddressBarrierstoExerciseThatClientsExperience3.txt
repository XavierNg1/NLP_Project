 Some soreness is typical, but if it lasts more than a few days, she either overdid it or isn't taking proper care of herself.


Check in to see if she's getting enough nutrient-rich meals, hydration, and sleep.
Be vigilant for symptoms of possible over-training, which include slower recovery, irritability, reduced motivation, decreased performance and altered resting heart rate.

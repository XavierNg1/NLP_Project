 Ensure you drink the recommended amount of water, which is about 13 cups per day for men and 9 cups for women.Drink plenty of fluids throughout the day in order to help rinse away bacteria and prevent dry mouth. Both can contribute to the formation of tonsil stones.


Swap out sodas, sports drinks, energy drinks, and fruit juices for water, since sugar can increase bacteria buildup.
Alcohol dehydrates and causes dry mouth, so limit your alcohol consumption and be sure to brush well after to drinking, especially if you have recurring tonsil stones.
 Consider limiting your sugar and dairy intake. Consuming too many sugary foods increases tartar, plaque, and bacteria buildup. Dairy products also promote oral bacterial growth, so make sure to give your teeth a good brush after drinking milk or consuming other dairy.
 Nasal allergies, head colds, and post-nasal drips can cause mucus to accumulate in the back of your throat. Mucus increases your exposure to oral bacteria, and contributes to the development of tonsil stones. If you frequently experience problems with nasal allergies, try reducing your exposure to pollen by closing windows and spending more time indoors during allergy season, and keep the air moist in your home using a humidifier.

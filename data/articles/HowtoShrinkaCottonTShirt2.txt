 Contrary to popular belief, dryer heat actually does not shrink garments! According to a fabric technologist for Whirlpool, shrinkage is caused when the fabric tumbles against the sides of the washer and the dryer.








The movement of the garments inside your washing machine also affects how much the fabric shrinks. Washing machines that are front-loaders, meaning the machines' loading and unloading doors are in the front, produce less agitation, and therefore less shrinkage, than top-loaded washing machines., Remember, you don't need to blast your cotton shirt with heat (it's the tumbling action that causes shrinking), so use a medium-heat setting to dry.
 Dark garments quickly lose their brand-new feeling when put in the dryer and subjected to repeated tumbling. This is because the tumbling action raises microscopically small fibers, giving them a "powdery" look.
 Enjoy the way your shirt fits better than it did before!

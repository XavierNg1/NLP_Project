This will take about 2 minutes.While waiting, snip the bottom corner off of the bag. If you are using a piping bag, then snip the tip off., Start piping the Nutella from the outer edge of the pancake and work your way towards the center.

Cook the pancake for another 1 to 2 minutes, or until it is golden on both sides., Wipe the pan after each pancake that you make. Every few pancakes, add more cooking spray or butter to the skillet; be sure to wipe the butter off, however!, You serve them as they are, or garnish them with slices strawberries or bananas.

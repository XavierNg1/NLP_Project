 Pinking shears aren't an essential tool in the sewing basket but they are a nice one to have. Besides creating non-fray edges for both stored and used fabrics, and seamed edges for sewn items, they make great edgings for easy jam jar lid covers and other crafty items, as well as making cute edges to craft projects that benefit from a naive art touch, such as small cushions and sachets. On the downside, a good pair will cost at least U$20.00, so if they are something you won't use all that often, so weigh up whether you want to own or a pair or whether you can borrow those of a friend or neighbor.;
, There are a lot of these available but they're absolutely no good for fabric because they're only made to cut paper. By all means have some for your paper-craft but don't mix them up.
 Things to look for include:


Quality manufacture
Trustworthy brand name

Stainless steel blades; lower blade extends for better control
Molded handles fit neatly and are strong (usually plastic; check it's quality plastic)

Ambidextrous (either left or right hand); if not, be sure they are the correct hand for your needs
Ability to try them in the store to see how they handle and feel.
 Pinking shears come in lighter and heavier weights. The need will be dictated by the type of fabric you're cutting but lightweight are probably easiest for most people to work with.
 Oil them periodically and have their edges professionally sharpened to ensure that they stay in the best condition.


You'll know that pinking shears are due for a sharpening when they stop cutting the fabric sharply but start either not cutting or are destroying the fabric.

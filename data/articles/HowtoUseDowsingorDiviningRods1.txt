 You can use natural items as dowsing or divining rods, such as tree branches or sticks. Often, diviners use forked sticks from trees such as willow, peach, and witch hazel. Look for a stick that has a fork with branches of equal length on either end of the fork.If you do not want to use a forked stick, you can use coat hanger, two wire rods, or a pendulum as a dowsing rod. Cut the coat hanger so you have two pieces of wire that are the same length and extend at least one to two feet. You can also use two wire rods of equal length or a pendulum made especially for dowsing from New Age stores or online.
Some divining rods have an L-shape on each end, where the wire extends downward to form an L-shape. You can find L-shaped rods online or at New Age stores.;
, You should then hold the rods in each hand at an arm’s length away from your body. Position the rods so they rest flat over your index fingers and let the butt of the handles rest in the heel of your hands. Do not grip the handles too tightly as the rods need to be able to float freely to work.Hold the rods about 9 inches (23 cm) apart so they do not cross or collide. You may want to practice holding the rods in your hands a few times to get the hang of it.
If you are using one forked stick, you should hold it an arm's length away from your body. Make sure you hold the stick lightly so it can float freely in your hand.
 Once you understand how to hold the rods properly, you should practice walking and moving around while holding the rods. Make sure you keep the rods steady and straight as you walk so they are parallel to the ground.Hold the rods at arm’s length and walk slowly back and forth across the room. Do not let the rod end tip upward or downward as you move as you do not want to move the rods unintentionally with the force of your body or your arms.

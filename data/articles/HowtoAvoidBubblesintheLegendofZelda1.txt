 Bubbles in these versions of the game are invulnerable to any type of attack. They are simply skulls inside balls of fire that run against the walls or across the floor linearly. They do not fire any weapons or aggressively attack your character.;
, Bubbles do not attack but will deal damage if your character touches it. Shields will not protect you either, so staying clear of the monster is the only way to avoid damage. Study how the monster goes from one point of the room to another, and back to its original position. Studying its movement will allow you to time your movement correctly.
 Once youâ€™ve identified its movement, you can plan your route pass the monster. You can simply walk across the room once the Bubble passes you or before it gets near you.

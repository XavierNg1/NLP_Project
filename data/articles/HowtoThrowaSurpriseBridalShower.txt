 Select a date when all the important people can make it, including the bride-to-be. So, know everyone’s availability and plan accordingly.;
, You love your girlfriend, but it will be to her own advantage if you lie to her in this situation. Your friend will figure out that you’re planning a party no matter how hard you try to hide it (or no matter how many people on Facebook you tell not to say anything). So, tell her it’s a party – just don’t say that it’s a bridal shower party. Make up a birthday, anniversary, going-away, etc. party.
 A rental projector is the perfect way to showcase home videos or collages of photos of the bride- and groom-to-be. Order the rental projector as soon as you know the date of the bridal shower. This way, you’ll ensure that the company has one reserved for you and that it gets to your house on time.
 The groom-to-be is the perfect person to help you plan the bridal shower. He’ll have those sought-after pictures that you want for your rental projector collage. Plus, he’ll be in on the conspiracy to help you avoid having the bride-to-be find out about the bridal shower.
 Regular party guests should have an earlier invite time than the bride-to-be. Make it at least 1 to 2 hours earlier since you know that most people are going to be late. This shouldn’t be too much of a problem since your guest of honor still thinks she’s going to some type of party. Everyone, however, will want to see her face when she walks in.
 Have all the cameras and video cameras ready for when the happy couple walk through the door, and capture as many memories of the day as possible. You can always use these for your next projector collage, for example, their first anniversary party.

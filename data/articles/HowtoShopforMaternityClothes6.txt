 Purchasing a comfortable bra will be one of your first orders of business once your breasts begin to swell. No matter how well your clothing fits, if your bra is too tight, you will be irritable and uncomfortable. In addition, you will look better in a bra that fits properly. Purchase bras that have two to three rows of hooks and adjustable straps so you can accommodate expansion.
 This is a personal choice. Some women prefer over the belly bands. Others prefer to stick with their bikinis or thongs. Comfort is the key so find a style that works for stock up.

 If you are doing bright eye makeup, a strong brow is a great way to frame the look.


Alternatively, you could fill in your eyes with a bright eyeliner instead.;
, With a heavy eyeshadow, you need to use a primer to protect the fragile skin of your eyelids.


A great brand of eyelid primer is Urban Decay's "Primer Potion."
Smooth a generous amount over and under the eyelids.
 Using a soft brush, smooth a black or dark gray into the crease of your eyelid.


A great bright eyeshadow pallet is BH Cosmetics 88 or 120 shades pallets.
You can also purchase inexpensive single eyeshadows or palettes from drugstores.
 Carefully smooth the shadow onto the lid, layering until you get the brightness you desire. Make sure to blend the colors with a clean fluffy brush for a smoother look.


Smooth the edges of the shadow into whatever shape you desire with your blending brush.

Pencil liner is easiest for beginners. Just make sure your pencil is sharp and clean.
You can also use gel liner or liquid liner, but it is often difficult to apply the first few times.



White liner will brighten the eye, but black gives a dramatic look.



Always curl your lashes first.
Maybelline, L'Oreal, and Covergirl all make great affordable mascara.
Eyelure and Ardell make affordable lashes that work great.

 Dip only the bottom 2/3 of the bristles into the ink. This will keep the ink away from the glue holding the bristles onto the metal ferrule. Hold the brush in the ink long enough to saturate the bristles.
 You may have to do this 2 or 3 times.
 Use a scrap of paper for this.
, This will keep the brush tip pointed and your inked lines at the proper thickness.


To help hold your brush in this position, place the side of your wrist on the paper and rest your middle finger on the paper ahead of the brush.
 Keep your thumb and forefinger locked, while bending your wrist from left to right if you're using your right hand and right to left if you're using your left hand.


Don't try to highlight all the penciled lines, only those that in your judgment bring out the scene you're inking. You may want to discuss beforehand with your penciler which lines are the important ones.
 Thicker lines are more important for outlines and showing shadows, while thinner lines are more important when doing detail work where the light source strikes. If you're doing mostly detail work, don't load as much ink into your brush.
 This will allow you to keep your brushstrokes straight, either horizontal or vertical, while keeping your ink lines flowing smoothly.


Be aware that some non-repro-blue pencils (very light blue pencils designed not to show up in photocopies) can be very waxy, which may cause the ink to run when crossing these lines.

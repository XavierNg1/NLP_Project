 First, start with a considerable amount of red. Then, add a small amount of yellow -- just 10% of red or so. Mix in the yellow until you have created a dark orange. The result should be far more red than yellow.






;
, Add just a little blue paint to the mix -- no more than 5-10Â % of the total color at first. Mix it in until the color begins to turn a rich, chocolatey brown. If it still looks too orange, mix in just a bit more blue.
 If you would like to darken the color a bit more, add a bit more blue. If it looks too dark, add orange. If you are mixing paints, just use some of the orange paints. If you're drawing, then lightly draw orange over the paint using red and yellow again.

 In Windows XP or newer, Mac OS X, and Ubuntu Linux, you can double-click the ZIP file and it will open in a new window. You can then copy the contents to another folder.


OS X will create a new folder next to the ZIP file when you double-click it, but may not open it automatically.;
, In Windows and Linux, you can right-click the Zip file and select “Extract All…” or “Extract Here”. Extract All will allow you to set a path for the extracted folder to go, and Extract Here will uncompress the folder and leave it in the same location as the ZIP file.

 You can accomplish this by using milk as a cleanser. Any grade or variety of milk is fine, though whole milk is ideal. Take 1 tablespoon of milk and apply it to your face with your own hands or a cotton ball that has been dipped in it. Gently rub around your face for 2-5 minutes. Rinse off.;
, Exfoliation is the process of removing excess buildup of dead skin cells, to reveal soft, smooth skin. Take a tablespoon of brown sugar and pat it on to your still wet face. If you have sensitive skin, or have never exfoliated before, let the sugar sit on your face and dissolve for a minute or two. Then rub is gently in circular motions all over your face and neck.
 Green tea is perfect for this, because of the antioxidants in it. Green tea can also help get rid of dark circles. Boil some water in a kettle, pour it into a cup, and steep for 8-10 minutes. Wait until it has cooled, then apply to your face with a cotton ball. Do not rinse.
 Our single ingredient mask is honey. Honey has antibacterial and moisturizing properties. Simply apply a thick layer onto your face. Leave on for 15 minutes. Rinse off.

 Peel and mash them while they are warm.;
, Add the chopped green chillies, chopped coriander leaves, salt, a pinch of asafoetida and red chilli powder to the mashed potatoes. Mix it well together.
 Make them into a round shape and flatten them. They are now potato (aaloo) tikkis. (If you want you can also make a paste of all purpose flour and wrap a thin coating around the tikkis so that they don’t fall apart while frying. : Optional)

, Fry the potato tikkis in the oil, wait till each one turns golden-brown in colour.
 The Aaloo ki Tikki is ready to serve.


You can serve the tikkis with chutney also.

 Determine what happens before each incident, and how that makes the child feel. You cannot help a child with maladaptive behavior until you understand how it works.


If possible, ask the child directly why they do that. During or after the episode, ask the child what went wrong and why they acted the way they did. Usually they have specific needs that are not being met.
Checklists exist for helping determine the reason behind maladaptive behaviors.;
, For example, if a girl only hits her head when seeing her therapist and being told "quiet hands," then she is trying to communicate that she is being mistreated.Find her a respectful therapist and the maladaptive behavior will cease.
 Is it causing direct harm (such as self-injury or screaming loudly around other people) or is it merely strange (e.g. flapping arms)? Take a day or two to ponder this question.


If the behavior doesn't cause real harm, then getting rid of it will probably cause more harm than good.Forcing people to appear "normal" is a waste of time that will ultimately diminish their self-esteem and tire them out.



Sometimes, well-intentioned people will extinguish a behavior, only to find out that their actions are robbing the disabled person of an important coping mechanism.This can be abusive and traumatic to the disabled person.For example, if you want to understand an autistic boy, then ask autistic people, because they experience the feelings and urges themselves.

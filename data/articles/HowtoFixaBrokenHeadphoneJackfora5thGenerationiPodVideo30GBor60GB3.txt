 There is no way to fix one that is broken or not working correctly unless you pay more than it would cost to just replace it. You can get headphone jack/hold buttons at www.ipodmods.com. They cost approximately $50. You can pay ipodmods to install it for you, but it is unnecessary when you can just as easily install it yourself considering they charge a ridiculous amount just for a simple task. You may also be able to find the proper headphone jack for less money on eBay (as little as $5).

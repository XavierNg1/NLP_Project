 Prepare the ovenproof baking dish by greasing with the margarine.
 Stir to combine., Cut the bread pieces into halves, diagonally. Arrange about a third of the cut slices in the prepared baking dish, just one layer., Add to the sultanas and mix together. Sprinkle a third of the mixture across the first layer in the baking dish., Add another third of the apricot and sultana mix., Put to one side, including the remaining dried fruit mixture (it will be used shortly)., Place the seeds into the saucepan. Add the non-dairy milk, cornflour and sugar., Whisk well to combine all of the ingredients until a smooth mixture forms., Simmer gently for 8 to 10 minutes. Whisk continuously as it cooks. When it is almost boiling and coats the back of a wooden spoon with falling off, it is done. Remove from the heat.

Do not neglect to keep whisking or the custard may become lumpy or even burn.
 Pour the custard evenly across all slices, allowing it to ooze to the base of the dish as well. Sprinkle the remaining dried apricot and sultana mix over the top of the custard., This will allow the flavours to infuse through the whole dish. While this is infusing, preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF., Bake for 25 to 35 minutes. The pudding is ready for adding the topping (see next) when it has turned a light gold colour and looks set., Warm it in a pan on low heat until it melts sufficiently. Set aside for use as a glaze when the pudding is ready., Spread the warm marmalade topping over the surface of the pudding. Place back in the oven to cook for just another 5 minutes. The pudding is ready when it turns golden., Allow to cool just a little, then dust with icing (powdered) sugar., Divide into portions to serve on plates or in bowls. Add some vegan cream or ice cream, optional.

 If you suspect your dog has roundworm, take him to the vet. During an exam, your vet can check to see if your dog has roundworm. The vet can screen fecal samples to check for eggs or other signs of the parasite.This is a quick test that is done without putting your dog to sleep.
You should take your dog back to the vet after treating the roundworm for another fecal sample to ensure that the roundworms are gone.
 If your dog has roundworms, your vet will give you a deworming pill that will get rid of the roundworm. Because the medicine wonâ€™t kill the eggs, you will have to treat the dog again in about four weeks to get any newly hatched roundworms.You can buy deworming products at pet stores or supercenters. Make sure to read the directions carefully and administer the medicine as described. Deworming medication can harm your dog if used incorrectly., The roundworm life cycle is a complex one and there are several opportunities within that life cycle for the dog to acquire infection.Dogs are at risk from roundworm eggs passed in feces. These eggs have a tough outer shell and can survive in the environment for months or even years. Thus, the feces may have been washed away by rain, but the roundworm eggs survive in the soil.Vermin that have accidentally acquired a roundworm infection can also spread them. The parasite cannot complete its life cycle in mice and rats, but the larvae can lie dormant in their bodies, ready and waiting to be activated when a dog eats them.A puppy in the womb may be infected by a migration of larvae across the placenta into his body. These larvae then lie dormant in the fetus's body tissue, ready to hatch out over his lifetime. Hence, the puppies are born already infected with roundworms.Once puppies are born, they can also be infected from larvae present in the mother's milk.

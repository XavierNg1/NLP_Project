 Starting a Netflix account for someone else is simple on your smartphone; begin by tapping the Netflix app icon on your home screen or app drawer.


If you don’t have the app yet, search for it on your device’s app store (Google Play for Android, iTunes App Store for iOS), and download it; it’s free.
 As soon as the Netflix application has been started, click on the link labeled “Set up Your Membership” found on the login screen.
 In the empty box that appears, enter the email address of the person for whom you’re creating the account. In the second box, enter a password.


Remember that the person for whom you’re creating the account will be using this email and password, hence you shouldn’t forget it.
 You should enter your payment details if you’re going to pay for someone else. However, if you want them to pay for the subscription, then you should enter their payment information.
 Check the box that shows you agree with Netflix’s terms and conditions. Complete your registration by tapping on the link labeled “Start Membership.”

, Give the password to the account you’ve just created to the person whom you created it for so they can begin enjoying movies on Netflix.

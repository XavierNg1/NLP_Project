 Parents who express too much concern about their child who stutters risk alienating the child and making him or her feel more self-conscious about the stutter.This will harm the child's progress more than help.
 Putting the child in stressful social situations so that they can learn to be "comfortable" will backfire., When a child stutters, let them finish their thoughts without interrupting them and finishing the words for them. Show love and acceptance to them when they stutter.
 If your child wants to talk about it, set aside time to discuss what they might be going through, and to discuss options in treating the stutter. Let your child know that you understand their frustration.
 Listen to any other recommendations the speech therapist might have.

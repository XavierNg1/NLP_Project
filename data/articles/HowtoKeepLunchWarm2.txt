 To ensure that the warm food stays warm and the cold food stays cold, make sure that you pack the entire lunch in an insulated lunch bag.Do not use brown paper bags. A brown paper bag will not provide any insulation for the food you pack in it. This means that the food you pack may no longer be warm or cold by lunch time.
 Wrapping the thermos in a paper towel or napkin will help to ensure that it stays warm. It will provide an extra layer of protection against the cold from the cold food items in the lunch bag. Wrap a paper towel or napkin all the way around the thermos.








You may want to use a rubber band to keep the paper towel or napkin in place.
 Separate the warm and cold food items as best you can. Place the thermos on one side and any cold items on the other side of the bag. You may also separate the items with neutral temperature items, such as napkins or utensils.If the lunch is for your child, then instruct him or her to leave the items packed as they are or the warm food might cool down.
 If you have a divider for your insulated lunch bag, then you can use the divider to separate the warm and cold items. Place the divider between the warm and cold items and then seal the bag.If you donâ€™t have a divider, then you could use a piece of cardboard cut to fit in the bag.

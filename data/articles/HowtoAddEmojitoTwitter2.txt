 Locate the app on your mobile device. The app icon has the Twitter logo on it. Tap on it.
 If you’re not logged in yet, you will be asked to do so. Enter your registered email address and password into the fields provided, and tap “Sign in” to continue.
 Tap the “New Tweet” button on the top right corner of your screen to bring out the tweet window. Type your tweet here, but do not tap the “Tweet” button yet.
 Most likely, the default keyboard of your mobile device doesn’t carry emoji. Change your keyboard to one that has emoji. On iOS, tap the World or Smiley-face button on the keyboard until you see the emoji keyboard. On Android (version 4.0 and later), select the emoji keyboard from the notifications menu or tap the Smiley-face button on your keyboard.


If your device doesn’t have an emoji keyboard or if you prefer a different one than what’s built-in, you can go to the App Store for iOS or the Play Store for Android and download an emoji keyboard. Swype, SwiftKey, and Minuum are a few of the popular keyboards that offer emoji.

 Once the emoji keyboard has been selected, you can tap the emoji you’d like to use with your tweet. Repeat as necessary to add more emoji to your tweet.
 When you’re satisfied with the emoji and your tweet, tap the “Tweet” button on the top right corner of the tweet window. Your tweet will appear on your wall, and it will be seen by all your followers.

 Mix one part olive oil to one part vinegar. Add a small squirt of lemon oil or fresh lemon juice, if desired.You won’t need a lot of solution; you can pour the mixture in a jar, put a lid on the jar and shake to mix.Instead of olive oil, you can try 1/4 cup (60 mL) fresh lemon juice, 1/8 cup (30 mL) distilled vinegar, and 1/8 cup (30 mL) flax oil to restore your wood furniture.
Olive oil and vinegar polishes, restores moisture to dry wood, and can remove light scratches and rings from water condensation.
Besides having an attractive fragrance, lemon is acidic, so it works as a cleaning agent.
 For instance, you may want to test the solution in a small area underneath the furniture. Dip your cloth to get just a bit of solution on it. Rub the cloth on the test area, then buff it dry with a clean cloth.If you don’t notice any negative effect to the test area, you can proceed with cleaning the whole piece.
In addition to or instead of the test area, consult with the manufacturer of your furniture via their website to find the proper care instructions for your furniture.
 Use a soft, clean rag or a piece of cheese cloth.Dip the rag to get a small amount of the mixture on it.Too much liquid can penetrate the wood and cause damage. Don’t pour solution directly onto the furniture.
 Make sure to distribute the polish evenly. Rub with the grain to remove water marks and scratches.Switch to a clean area of the cloth, or a new cloth, when you see it becoming visibly dirty., Use a clean cloth to buff the wood in circular motions. If you notice any spots that didn’t get clean, use the cleaning solution on them and go back to buffing. Make sure to buff away moisture as the last step., Annual or biannual polishing will give your wood furniture moisture and shine, and help prevent it from looking dry and worn.

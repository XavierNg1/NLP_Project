 A microplane cheese grater consists of a handle attached to a long, flat grate with small, sharp teeth.Although they are usually used for zesting lemons or grating garlic, they are perfectly serviceable when it comes to grating cheese.


Because microplanes tend to produce smaller pieces of grated cheese, they are best used with hard cheeses such as Parmesan or Pecorino. Grating a soft cheese like mozzarella with a microplane would only give you a mushy mass instead of cleanly grated cheese.;
, If it is too large to hold comfortably with one hand, slice it into manageable pieces with a knife. Err on the side of larger rather than smaller â€” there's less of a chance you'll hurt yourself with a big piece of cheese.
 Continue until you have the desired amount.
 Use a pastry brush, if necessary, to remove all the cheese trimmings from the microplane.
 Microplane graters come in a variety of sizes ranging from fine to coarse.Finely shredded cheese can be used as the top layer of a freshly made pizza. Medium shredded cheese is thicker and a nice topping for baked potatoes or salads. Coarsely grated cheese is the thickest and can be used to garnish pasta.

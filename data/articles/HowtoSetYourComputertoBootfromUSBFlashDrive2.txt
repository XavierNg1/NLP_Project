 Make sure that it is plugged into the computer itself and not through a USB hub.
 Every computer manufacturer has a different boot screen. As soon as you see the logo, you will need to hit either F2, F10, or Del to enter the BIOS menu. These are the most common keys for entering the BIOS menu. The key you need to press will be displayed under the logo.


This part of the boot process can occur quickly, and you may have to restart the computer if you missed the chance to enter BIOS.
 If you hit the correct key at the correct time, you should now be in the BIOS menu for the computer. This is where basic computer functions are set, before an OS (Operating System) is loaded. Navigate to the Boot menu. Every manufacturer has a different BIOS setup. Some have the menu in a column; others have tabs across the top. Here’s an example BIOS:

, Once you are in the Boot menu, you will see a list of devices. This is the order of devices that the computer will attempt to find an OS on. Typically, the first device listed is the computer’s hard drive, usually followed by the CD/DVD drive.


Select the first boot device and change it to your flash drive. The menu will either say “Removable Device” or will display your flash drive’s model name. This will make the computer check your flash drive first after turning on, instead of the hard drive.
 Navigate to the Exit menu in the BIOS. Select “Exit and Save Changes.” Alternatively, many BIOS have a shortcut key displayed at the bottom that will save and exit with one keystroke.


Saving and exiting reboots your computer.
 After a few seconds, depending on what your flash drive is made for, you will be given control. If you made an MS-DOS flash drive, you will be given a command prompt after booting. If you made a Windows 7 install flash drive, the install process will begin automatically.

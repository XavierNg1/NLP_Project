 Make sure to plan for a variety of food and drink for your guests. This should include several appetizers or finger foods, a dessert, and beverages. Decide if you want to serve alcohol at your party, but even if you do be sure to include a non-alcoholic drink for those who wish to abstain from alcohol.


Try serving some food items like mini sandwiches, deviled eggs, pigs in a blanket, or veggie platters with various dips.
For the drinks, consider some kind of cola, water, punch, wine, and/or champagne.
 Some people might have masks with a handle, so the food should not be too complicated (or require both hands to eat). Include finger foods and beverages that go with the theme of your party.For example, if you are hosting a Mardi Gras themed masquerade party, you could include some mini New Orleans styled food like jambalaya and beignets.Provide straws for your guests so they can drink easily, even with a full-face mask.
 When everyone's arrived at your party, make a short opening announcement explaining the rules (don't make too many rules; you don't want to restrict the guests too much) and tell everyone that other than those few rules, they are welcome to do whatever they like.


As the host of the party, it is your responsibility to ensure that everyone has a good time and knows what is going on during the party.
 At midnight, there should be a moment when everyone unmasks themselves to unveil their identities to their fellow revelers. This should be a fun moment for all of your guests as they get to see who has been hiding behind the masks all night.As the host, you should announce the unveiling at midnight and encourage your guests to cheer and laugh as they do so.

 Take a sheet of foil and use it to line an 8 or 9-inch (20 to 22.5 cm) square pan. Spray the foil with cooking spray to ensure the fudge will come out easily. You can also use parchment paper.Tear off enough foil so it comes over the sides of the pan. This will make it easier to lift the fudge right out of the pan.;
, Get out a large microwave-safe bowl and place 3 cups (525 g) of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 14-ounce (396 g) can of sweetened condensed milk in it. Stir the milk and chocolate to combine them. Microwave them for 1 minute and stir the mixture.Use caution when handling the bowl out of the microwave. You may want to wear oven mitts to remove the bowl from the microwave.
 Return the bowl to the microwave and heat the fudge mixture for another 45 seconds. Remove it and stir the fudge so the chocolate chips melt completely. Transfer the melted fudge to your prepared pan and spread it evenly.Avoid letting the fudge sit in the bowl for too long since it will begin to set up.
 Sprinkle 1 cup (226 g) of toffee baking chips or chopped toffee bars over the top of the fudge in your pan. Place the toffee fudge in the refrigerator and chill it until it's hardened. This should take about 2 hours. Cut the chilled fudge and serve it.Try to cut the fudge into 1-inch (2.5 cm) squares. You can refrigerate the leftover fudge for up to five days.

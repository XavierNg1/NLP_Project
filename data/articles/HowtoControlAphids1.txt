 You may not be able to kill large infestations simply by crushing them, but killing one or two sends off a chemical signal that may warn other aphids to stay away.;
, If only one section of the plant is infected, snip it off with garden shears and drop it into a plastic bag or bucket of soapy water.
 Both bugs are natural predators of aphids and can help tame your aphid population. Purchase a ladybug house and commercial ladybug food to lure ladybugs to your garden, or purchase ladybugs from vendors or nurseries. Lacewings can also be lured with the same food or purchased from the save vendors.
 Chickadees and wrens are both especially useful in reducing the aphid population. Put up birdhouses and spread birdseed in your backyard.
 Ants actually protect aphid colonies. Lure them away by placing small containers of honey below an aphid-infested plant. The honey should draw the ants away, exposing the aphids to more natural predators.
 Sticky bands and other ant traps destroy the ants that protect aphids instead of merely drawing them away.
 Mint, fennel, dill, yarrow, clover, and dandelions are known to attract lacewings, ladybugs, and a type of insect actually called the "aphid predator." Placing these plants around the plants you wish to protect may draw predators capable of controlling the aphid population.
 Garlic and onion plants are the most effective. The potent smell typically drives away most colonies of aphids.
 Grow plants that attract aphids, like asters, cosmos, larkspur, dahlias, and zinnias, but plant them away from the plants you want to protect. The aphids will be drawn to these plants and will stay away from less appetizing plants as a result.
 They find aphids great meals for them. Purchase a praying mantis or a praying mantis habitat.

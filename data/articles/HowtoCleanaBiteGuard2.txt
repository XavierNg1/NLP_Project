 This step helps to loosen plaque and other oral debris. Do this immediately after taking the guard out of your mouth. Turn on the tap and let the water run until it feels lukewarm. Run the bite guard under the water.You can skip this step if you're using this method after a soap-and-water cleansing.
 Baking soda is the least abrasive anti-bacterial substance you can use for oral hygiene.Mix baking soda with water. Use 2/3 cups (185 g) for a long-term supply or a teaspoon (4.93 g) for a one-time test. Add water drop by drop and mix thoroughly until the baking soda becomes a paste.

It's best to avoid toothpaste for this method. Even toothpastes formulated for sensitive teeth can cause abrasions on flexible plastic. Abrasions provide hiding places for bacteria that can lead to oral infections., Use only a brush with soft or ultra soft bristles. More abrasive bristles can wear down the plastic of the bite guard. You can use your regular toothbrush for this method, whether it's manual, electric, or battery-powered., Use the same horizontal and/or vertical strokes you normally use to brush your teeth. Just apply less pressure. Brush the inside and outside of the bite guard. Make sure you clean the entire surface to kill harmful bacteria. Rinse the guard with warm water when you're finished brushing., When the baking soda is completely rinsed off, lay the bite guard on a clean towel. Make sure the towel is on a flat surface to reduce the risk of the guard falling on the floor. Allow it to air dry for 15-30 minutes. Make sure it's completely dry before putting it back in its protective case.

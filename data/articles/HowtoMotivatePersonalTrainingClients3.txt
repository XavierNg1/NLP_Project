 Changing your client's workouts regularly helps them avoid hitting a progress plateau, and it will help them stay motivated. Introduce new physical activities every so often so that they have the challenge of trying something new. You might discover a type of exercise that they particularly enjoy. People will be much more motivated to exercise if it’s a fun outlet rather than a dreary chore.Even though two hours of cardio and an hour of free weights will probably get your client results, it’s also probably not sustainable. Make sure you help your client find an exercise routine that they can keep up. If they feel overwhelmed, they’re likely to quit altogether.
 This has several benefits for both your client and yourself. If your client is struggling midway through a workout, you can remind them that their favorite exercise is coming up.Additionally, ending a workout on a positive, strong note is key. Your client probably won’t feel motivated if their last memory from a workout is crying midway through a set of push-ups. They’ll be much more encouraged to come back if they end their workout feeling great!

, If your client absolutely hates doing a certain exercise or working out a particular body part, motivate them by telling you those exercises will make the most difference. If they hate it because it’s so hard, they probably need to work on it! Don’t let them skip anything or only choose their favorite workouts.Take note of the things they really don’t like doing, and be extra encouraging during these.

 If you have a double breast pump, you'll want to position 2 shields over your nipples simultaneously. Double breast pumps can save enormous amounts of time for mothers who need to produce milk quickly or who have a baby who requires a lot of milk.
 The milk will automatically begin pumping from your breast into the container.
 If the milk seems to be pumping slowly or the suction feels painful, adjust it. Try repositioning your breasts and the rest of your body. The process should not be painful, although it may feel strange at first.
 This will make the pumping process go much more smoothly. Some mothers can be made uneasy by a loud breast pumping machine. However, if you're relaxed, you will often produce more milk in less time than you would while anxious.
 When using an electric or battery-operated pump, you should be finished within 15 to 20 minutes.

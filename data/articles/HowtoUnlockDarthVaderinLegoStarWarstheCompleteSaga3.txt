 You must finish all of Episode VI in this mode in order to unlock Darth Vader.
 This unlocks the fifth chapter: Jedi Destiny.
 You will be playing as both Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.


The Emperor will try to hit you with his force lightning and jump around after each hit. Chase the emperor to where he lands every time he jumps.
When you get hit with his force lightning, switch characters and attack him again. Keep repeating these steps until he is defeated.
 Once the "Jedi Destiny" is complete, Darth Vader will be unlocked. You will not have to buy him from the shop.

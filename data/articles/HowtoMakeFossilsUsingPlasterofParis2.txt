 You'll be working with modeling clay and plaster, so, needless to say, this isn't the cleanest of projects. Lay some newspapers down and let's get started. You'll need:


Plaster of Paris
Water
Modeling clay
Petroleum jelly
Small natural objects such as sea shells
Paper cups
Plastic spoons
Newspaper or paper towels

, Use 1 part plaster of Paris to 2 parts water and mix well in a paper cup with a plastic spoon. Let it sit while you work with the clay.
 Generally, leaves, shells, branches, or bones work best. Just make sure you have enough clay and plaster to cover it.
 This will be what your object rests and forms an impression in. It needs to be kneaded until it can cover the area of your object.
 Firmly yet slowly press it into the modeling clay to make an impression. The petroleum jelly prevents it from sticking to the clay, so be generous.


Remove the object carefully to create a mold in the shape of the item you used.
 Smooth the plaster to the level of the clay to form a flat surface.


Place your clay and plaster mold on a newspaper, paper towel, or other disposable surface and allow it to harden. You'll need to wait at least overnight, but 2 or 3 days is preferable and safer.
 The shape of your object should be recreated in the plaster, details intact.

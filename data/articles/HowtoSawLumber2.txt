Retract the blade guard and place the unplugged saw blade next to the wood piece.
Use the adjustment lever or knob to set the blade 1/4 to 1/2 inches (6 to 13 mm) below the wood.
 Let the piece you are cutting off fall freely from the unsupported end. Restricting it will affect the cut.
 You can do this by nailing the board to the sawhorses.


Use a combination square and pencil to mark your cut.
Start the saw 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the wood and guide the saw along the line, pinching the shoe of the saw between your thumb and forefinger. Keep your fingers as far away from the cut line as possible.



Place 2 2-by-4s across the sawhorses to keep the plywood from splintering when you finish the cut.
 The guard can catch on the wood if you leave it down during angled cuts. When you've cut a few inches into the wood, lower the guard and finish the cut.
 If your cut goes crooked when sawing, don't try to straighten it out. Stop sawing and start again along the line.

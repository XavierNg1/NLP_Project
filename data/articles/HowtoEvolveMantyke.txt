 In order for Mantyke to change to Mantine, you need to meet the only condition it needs to evolve: that is to have a Remoraid in your Pokémon party while Mantyke levels up at least once.


Remoraid is a water-type Pokémon introduced in the second generation of the game (Gold, Silver, and Crystal) and can be identified by its light-blue body, big eyes, and two large tail fins.
Remoraid can be found in any bodies of water (lakes and seas) throughout the entire game series. You can usually find it in places where you can also catch a Mantyke.;
, Preferably a lake or a sea.
 Once you get to a lake or a sea, you can either use a fishing rod (an in-game item acquired through quests) or swim in and use a Pokémon to encounter a Remoraid and battle it.
 Once you get to battle one, weaken it using any Pokémon in your party.


When it’s about to get knocked out, throw a Pokéball at it (an ordinary Pokéball will do) to catch it and include it in your party.
 Once you have a Remoraid in your party, it’s time to level up Mantyke. There is no specific kind of battle you need to do, but fighting trainers, which can be found anywhere in the game, gives off more XP compared to defeating wild Pokémon.


You can also fight fire, ground, and rock types (these types are weak against water Pokémon like Mantyke) for easy wins.
 If you don’t want to level up Mantyke through Pokémon battles, you can always use in-game items like Rare Candies.


Rare Candies allow your Pokémon to gain one level instantly without doing any Pokémon battles.
Each game only has a limited number of Rare Candies that you can get from side quests or special shops, but since Mantyke only needs to level up once to evolve, you only need one Rare Candy.

 Your heart rate fluctuates based on your activity. Even standing can elevate heart rate. So before you measure your heart rate, you need to allow yourself to “relax.”A good way to find out your resting heart rate is to measure it immediately after waking up in the morning.
Do not measure your heart rate after exercise as it can remain elevated and you won’t be able to get an accurate reading. Also, being stressed, anxious or upset can elevate your heart rate.
Do not measure your heart rate after drinking caffeine or in a hot, humid environment as these might temporarily increase your heart rate.;
, Use the tips of your middle and ring fingers to press down on (or palpate) the radial pulse on the inside of your wrist or on the side of your neck (your carotid artery)., It might take you a moment to feel the pulsation and you might need to move your fingers around to find it.
 Count the number of beats in 30 seconds and multiply by two or in 10 seconds and multiply by six to get your heart rate per minute.


For example, if you counted 32 beats in 30 seconds, multiply that by two to get your resting heart rate of 64. Or, if you counted 10 beats in 10 seconds, multiply 10 by six to get a resting heart rate of 60.
If your rhythm is irregular, count for a full minute. As you begin counting, start the first pulse felt as zero and the second pulse as one.
Repeat the measure a few times to get a more accurate reading.

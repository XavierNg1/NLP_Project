,, There are two ways to do this:


Drop-down menu: Click on the Edit tab in the drop-down menu. Scroll down to Find and Replace.



You can also do the short key by pressing CTRL+H or CTRL+F on your keyboard. The “Find and Replace” window will appear.
 Don't put anything in the Replace box unless that's the action you're wanting to perform.
 The document is searched and if the term or word is there, the first occurrence of it will appear (it will have a blue box around it in the spreadsheet).


You can continue scrolling for more by clicking on Find again. It will jump to the next occurrence if there is one. If it finds nothing, it will tell you "No more results, looping around".
 When you’re done, click “Done” at the bottom of the window to exit the “Find and Replace” window and go back to your spreadsheet.

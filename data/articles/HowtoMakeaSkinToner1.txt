 Add 1 cup (237 ml) of water and ½ cup (118 ml) of fresh lemon juice to a glass or plastic bottle. Shake the bottle well to ensure that the ingredients are well mixed.For best results, use filtered, distilled, or bottled water.
Lemon juice can help remove excess oil, tighten pores, and kill bacteria.
Be sure to use a bottle that can hold at least 12 ounces for the toner.;
, When you’re ready to use the toner, wet a cotton pad or ball with it. Gently stroke it over your face, paying special attention to areas where you get most oily.If you prefer, you can place the lemon toner in a spray bottle and mist your face with the toner. Allow your skin to absorb it before moving on your skin care routine.
 While lemon juice can help improve the look of oily skin, it also lightly exfoliates, which can leave your face more sensitive to the sun. Protect your skin by applying a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 if you’ve applied the toner during the day.

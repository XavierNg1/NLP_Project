 Spelt flour has very fragile gluten, as compared to wheat flour. This means that you will want to treat your mixture differently than you would when using wheat flour.


Start out using only 1/2 of the ingredients that are called for in a wheat flour recipe. Remember, since spelt is different from wheat, it will require either less or more of what is usually in the recipe. One reason why you are only adding half is because spelt flour has a higher concentration of complex carbohydrates. This means that the bread itself will be lighter, fluffier, and have a softer crust. If you are making sponge dough, for example, spelt flour has a higher volume of rise.
A recipe that calls for one cup of wheat flour, 3 eggs and 2 cups of milk may change completely when spelt flour is substituted. To make sure that you do not overdo it on the other ingredients, it is always a good idea to start with half of the other ingredients and work up from there. Start with one egg and 1 cup of milk, and add more as needed.;
, Not all recipes are the same, so it may be a long, drawn out process to have to develop a conversion for all of them. Your best bet is to find new recipes that are designed specifically for spelt flour.
 While kneading, pay careful attention to the consistency of the dough. The general rule of thumb for spelt flour is to only add 3/4 of what you would normally add with wheat flour. When adding water, it is best to keep an eye on the mixture, and only use approximately 3/4 for what the recipe calls. You can always add more in small amounts as necessary.


If it is sticky and too wet, add more spelt flour to create a more dough-like texture.
If it is too dry and not sticking together, slowly add more of the liquid ingredients until a solid but pliable ball of dough forms.

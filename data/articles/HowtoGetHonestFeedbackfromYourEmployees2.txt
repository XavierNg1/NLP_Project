 Remind your employees that you will receive this feedback without judgement, and that you genuinely want to make the workplace better. Thank all employees when feedback is given, to show that you really do appreciate it.


Once you have received feedback, take a night to consider the feedback and to come up with how you will work to change the negative aspects of the work environment.
 If you get feedback that makes you feel angry or defensive, do not show your employees this. Employees will be much less likely to give honest feedback if you react negatively to what they have to say.


If something bothers you tremendously, excuse yourself from the situation to calm yourself down so that you do not show how the feedback has made you feel.
 Doing this will help to show your employees that you are serious about using their feedback to better the work environment, and the company as a whole.


If one bit of feedback was that they feel that you do not have time to discuss work-related problems with your employees, set up a time slot each day when you will make yourself entirely available to your employees.
 Rather than making your feedback session a one time event, make sure that your employees know that feedback is always welcome. Consider making feedback surveys a permanent part of each month (or week) of work.


Ask for feedback regularly, be it with how a presentation went, or if your employees like the new holiday decoration you put up.
 When your employees come to you with honest feedback, it is important to try to make changes that they suggest as soon as possible (if you agree with their suggestions). If you donâ€™t agree with their suggestions, work with the employees to come up with a compromise.


Extend your heartiest thanks when the ideas and action items prove beneficial.

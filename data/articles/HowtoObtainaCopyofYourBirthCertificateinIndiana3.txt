 Hours of operation, procedures, and fees for service vary by county in Indiana.


The state website includes contact information, fees, and other general details for each county health department.Some counties may permit orders over the phone or online, and may accept different forms of payment.



The information you should be prepared to provide includes: your name now and at birth; city, county, and hospital of birth; date of birth; and name of both parents (including any adoptive parents).
 A single state or federal government-issued photo ID will suffice.


If you do not have a government photo ID, 2 forms of secondary proof of ID will also work. These include a signed Social Security card, a signed federal 1040 tax form, a signed lease form, a signed voter registration card, and others.
A full list of acceptable forms of ID is available as a .pdf file, which links from the FAQ section of the Vital Records website.You can also call Vital Records at 317-233-2700, or the county health department, to inquire about ID requirements.
 To be more precise, if you were born before October 1907.


Birth certificates issued before October 1907 are filed only with county health departments in Indiana, so this will be your only option. If you are in this boat, congratulations on your longevity!

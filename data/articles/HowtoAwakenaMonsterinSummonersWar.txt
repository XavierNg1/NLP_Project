 If you have not finished all seven levels in Normal Mode in Kabir Ruins, then Cairos Dungeon will not be open to you, which, as you will find out, is a necessity.;
,, You can do this by tapping on the logo for it once.
 Keep clicking until you find the certain Hall of Element/Magic you need to gain more essences.


The Hall of Elements all open on certain days only. For example, on a Monday, you cannot go hunting for wind essences, as the only Element Hall that's open on Monday is the Dark Hall.
 When you find the dungeon that you want to go through, tap on the icon for it once. This will bring the preparation screen, where you can prepare your team, look at the boss's stats, or even bring a friend's rep with you.
 Ensure that you're ready first.
 Once you defeat the boss of that floor, you will be rewarded with essences.
, Tap the awaken tab and hit the "Awaken" button in the bottom right corner of the screen. You will get a pop-up that says "Your monster will undergo a unique transformation. Are you sure you want to awaken?" This is to prevent players who accidentally tap the Awaken button from awakening the wrong monster. Hit Yes if it's the right monster.
 At the end of it, it should show your newly awakened monster and its awakened name at the bottom.
 You have now awakened your monster!

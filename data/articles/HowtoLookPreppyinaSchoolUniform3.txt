 This could be you favorite hair clip, headband, or much more.
 Experiment with different styles in your hair. From braids to low pigtails to French plaits they are all so cute. You can even just wear yours down.
 Choose a color that's natural and that you love for your whole head. If you want to use a wild color like pink or blue, just do highlights. They look cute and quirky.

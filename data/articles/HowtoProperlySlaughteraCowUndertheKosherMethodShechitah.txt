 The length of the blade is twice the width of the animal's neck.;
, If the animal is ill or injured, it is no longer considered Kosher. This has two purposes. First, it ensures the quality of the meat because an ill or injured animal should not be eaten anyway. Second, it provides a disincentive for Kosher farms to partake in the methods of other farms, because if the cow is hurt in any way, it cannot be slaughtered.
 If the animal is injured during the restraining, it is no longer considered kosher.
 Make sure that there are absolutely no nicks or unevenness. Any blemish on the blade at all, even one big enough for a human hair to fall into, renders the knife unacceptable for kosher slaughter. The knife must be sharpened to such a sharp point that if the Shochet were to slice of his/her finger, he/she would feel no pain. , The incision must not at all pull or tear, and must be performed in one motion free of any pause. If done correctly, the animal will die within 2 seconds.
 Eating blood is not Kosher, because the blood contains the soul of the animal.
 For mammals (cows, sheep, goats, etc.), make sure there are no defects. The lungs must be inflated to check for unwanted holes, and for signs of lung disease. If there are holes or signs of active lung disease, the cow is not considered kosher.
 These include the blood vessels and the sciatic nerve (unless you are Ashkenazi and have no tradition of its removal). As with the lungs, this only applies to mammals., Internal fat, known in Hebrew as "cheilev," is not considered Kosher.

On many software programs, there is a high-pass and a low-pass function. The high-pass button will generally cut any frequencies below 100Hz and sometimes 80Hz.
The low-pass button will generally cut any frequencies above around 10kHz. Many live mixing boards have a high-pass button which serves the same purpose as the software version.
These buttons allow the user to cut out any unwanted high and low harmonics that can be troublesome in the mix.;
, Software programs make it possible for the user to cut or boost 3 to 7 frequencies simultaneously. These are called bands. Start by with just 1 band at a time. Turn on the bandwidth by clicking on the frequency spectrum screen.



The bandwidth is the frequency range in which the band will boost or cut. The bandwidth is also referred to as the "Q". The higher the Q the skinnier the bandwidth.
The Q can be set to as little as 1/30 of an octave up to 3 octaves. By having a wider Q you can get more of basic tone shaping out of the band.
By making the Q more narrow you can cut frequencies that may be an issue, such as an unpleasant sound or overtone.
Widen or narrow the Q by lowering or raising the number, respectively.
 Once you have set your frequency and Q width you can cut or boost the bandwidth. Use the gain function on the parametric and cut the band by lowering the gain below zero or boost the gain by raising the gain above zero. Make very minimal adjustments until the desired sound is achieved.

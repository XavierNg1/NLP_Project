 All alphas are themselves no matter what. Don't be afraid to show your true personality. Let them know that you're fierce. Nobody wants a clone alpha.
 It shows others that you're not fit to be an alpha. Instead, act like you don't have a care in the world. Never flirt around boys. Insult them and treat them like dirt. Alphas are know for their sharp tongues so get some dirt to throw around. Don't even treat your friends super-nice. Don't let them get all the attention. Show them who's the boss around there.
 No matter how popular those popular girls are, they aren't alphas. If you copy them, you won't be one either. There's a fine line between being a popular girl and being an alpha, but you've got to know the difference. Alphas don't ever worry about clothes. Get some cute clothes and makeup if you want, but don't make it the best thing about you.
 Make sure you have frequent public outbursts over who's boss though. This will make it look like you know what you're doing. Be careful about this, because your friend could overthrow you.
 Yes, alphas are supposed to be bad, and bad girls don't pay attention in class, but pay attention in class anyway. Who would want a dumb alpha? Remember, alphas have the smarts, looks, and are Miss Personalities. People tend to respect smart people more than dumb ones.
 Don't be afraid to order people around. After all, you are their alpha. Never cut the school slack. It's a sign of weakness. Treat your friends extra hard. People see that of you are that hard on your friends, imagine what what happen to them.
 You don't have to be a cold hearted ice queen. Just don't be nice in the teddy bear way. You should be dangerously intelligent, kind, and pretty. You can be nice, but it should be really hard to get you to crack. That's what your friends are for. They show that even though you're tough, you're not cold and heartless.
 Becoming an alpha might be hard, but you'll be at the top of the world very soon.

 Television advertisements can also be rather targeted by placing your ads during shows that the watchers would fit your targeted demographics. As an example, if you are advertising a product to a child or household with children, placing your ad between cartoon shows would allow you to reach your desired audience. You also have the advantage of running ads locally. A commercial will want to be creative and eyecatching. It is important to always include a phone number, website address if available, and address during the entire commercial. A big advantage with a TV commercial is that you are able to hit a large audience in a very short amount of time.;

It is common for restaurants to advertise off highways to get customers off the road and into their establishment. A great advantage to billboard advertising is the cost is rather inexpensive. It is also more likely that a person would pass that billboard multiple times and see the advertisement multiple times, thus they would remember it better than an ad they saw only once in any other advertising form.
 Radio advertising is similar to television advertising only not giving a visual perspective. Radio advertising does give you the advantage of targeting your message to a specific group of listeners. You can target your advertisement to country listeners, rock, etc. Another advantage is that in a radio ad the message is coming directly from the personâ€™s mouth.

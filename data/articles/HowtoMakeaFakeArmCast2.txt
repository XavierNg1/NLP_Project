 Cut the ankle out of the sock. Cut a small triangle off at the ankle, leaving it attached on the top side.If the sock is long enough, you can cut off the foot all together. Basically, you want to create on log tube that will fit over your arm. By cutting off just the heel, you create a tube that lays flat on your arm.
Use a sock that you don't care about, as you will be damaging it beyond repair.
 Snip off the end of the sock at the toes so you have an even toe., Leaving about two inches or so at the bottom of the tube, cut out a small section to fit your thumb through.


Using sharp scissors, cut a half circle in the folded sock, creating a hole for your thumb.
 Pull the sock up as far as you want the cast to come up your arm. If it's too long, cut off part of the sock to make it shorter. However, you want to leave some to fold over the end of the gauze.
 Starting at the bottom, wrap you arm in the gauze. Leave some space at the bottom of the sock to fold over the gauze. Overlap each layer. When you reach your hand, wrap over and under your thumb, leaving your fingers free.Don't wrap it too tightly, as it will cut off circulation.
 Fold the ends of the sock over the gauze.


This step isn't vital, but it will make the ends look neater.
 Starting at the folded over edge of the sock at the bottom, wrap colored tape around your arm, overlapping as you go. You can use masking tape or duct tape.


Make sure not to wrap it too tightly. You don't want to cut off the circulation.
Work in smaller pieces to make it easier. Use about a foot of duct tape at a time so it doesn't fold back on itself.
You can use sports pre-wrap in place of the tape.
 If the edge of the duct tape overlaps near your thumb too much, carefully cut off the edges.

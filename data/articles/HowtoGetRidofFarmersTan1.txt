 Exfoliation is the process of removing the top layer of your skin's dead cells, which will help get rid of awkward tan lines faster. When the dead skin cells are scrubbed off, your tan will begin to lighten and your original skin tone will be restored.It may take several exfoliation treatments before you begin to notice a difference, so stay patient.;
, Exfoliating is easy and even good for your skin. With several different methods you can choose from, it really just depends on how abrasive you want the exfoliation to be. Using a loofah or wash cloth and cleansing cream, are two great methods to start out with.


A loofah will be the most effective because of its coarse texture. However, if you have sensitive or sunburned skin, avoid using a loofah because it may cause irritation. To use, gently scrub skin in circular motions for one to two minutes and repeat once a day in the shower or bath. .
A cream wash and wash cloth is the best method for sensitive skin, but it will take longer to work. To use, lather your wash cloth in soap and gently scrub skin in circular motions for three to five minutes once a day in the shower or bath.
 Soaking in a bath with added whole milk acts as a natural exfoliator by softening the top layers of your skin. It also adds moisture back into your skin cells. After your skin is softened, it becomes easier for the dead skin cells to fall off.Spend at least five to seven minutes in the whole milk and water.Tanned skin cells are already damaged and on there way out, so a soak in the tub just helps give them an extra push off., The acid in lemon juice may help to break down partially dead skin cells, while the texture of the sugar will serve to exfoliate. Simply cut a lemon in half, and squeeze the juice in with some sugar.Apply the mixture to a wash cloth, or your finger tips, and rub it against your skin using circular motions.


Avoid the sun for at least an hour after doing so, or youâ€™ll just get a darker tan.

 You can keep your cool in a losing situation by forgiving yourself, and your teammates (if applicable). Tell yourself, "As long as I put forth my best effort, it's OK that I lost. I tried really hard, but the other person had an advantage." You can also reassure yourself that it is not the end of the world, and that there will be more opportunities for you to win., If you find yourself in a losing situation, always remember to be a good sport. Don't trash talk the winner or the other team. Instead, congratulate them on a job well done. In your heart, you know that they worked as hard as you to earn that win.You can congratulate the winner by telling them, "Congratulations" and shaking their hand. You can even ask them to give you some pointers if they have time.
If it was a team effort, tell your opponents, "Good game!" with a smile.
 Even though you lost, you're still healthy right? Try to think about all the good things that came from your journey from start to finish. Even though you lost, you still probably learned some great skills along the way. Think about your potential and how far you have come; you are definitely not the same person as you were when you started this game.If you think about these things in the moment, it is much easier to accept and be humble about your defeat.

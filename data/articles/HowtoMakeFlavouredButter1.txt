 If you used unsalted butter, you may add a pinch of fine sea salt if desired, but do not use salted butter for sweet variations.


It's desirable to use fresh rather than dried flavourings as the dried flavours can be stale or musty and never as piquant as fresh ingredients.
Most butters may be used the same day or immediately after use, however some butters - especially those containing herbs and spices, are best used the next day after the flavours have developed.
 Chill in the fridge until needed, of freeze for longer term storage.

 Pour two standard packages of jello powder in the bowl. If you want different colored Jigglers, you'll need a different bowl and pan for each color.

, Pour the water into the bowl of jello powder and mix thoroughly. For more precise amounts, follow the instructions on the package.
 Again, check the package instructions for precise amounts. Mix again thoroughly.
 For a clear-cut shape, you may want to stay away from the add-ins. But for deliciousness, go for it.
 The larger the pan, the more jigglers you'll produce. A bowl is very hard to cut out of.









If you have molds, great! Just put the jello in there and let set.
 You'll be able to touch it without getting your fingers messy when it's set.









For layered jigglers, let one color set for about 45 minutes. Then, with another color that has sufficiently cooled (cold water has been added and it's set for about 20 minutes), add it on top. Repeat this process for as many layers as you like.
 Cut into squares or decorative shapes using a cookie cutter. If you're having trouble getting the shapes out, put the bottom of the pan in warm water to loosen.









Save the scraps for munching. It's still delicious, regardless of the shape it's in.
 Serve immediately; jello is best when very cold. Add a dollop of whipped cream or ice cream for more flavor or texture.

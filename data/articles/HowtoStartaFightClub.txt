 Fight Club is not about violence or hatred as most would think. Fight Club is about releasing your angers and stress; about fighting your problems; about going against normalcy and the safe little bubble you have become accustomed to living in. Fight Club is a way to fight your problems and find your masculinity. The concept of Fight Club is not something you can explain; it is something you must find for yourself, so if you have not read the book or seen the movie you should watch/read it - really watch/read it - and then analyze what it means to you.;
, You can always alter them to your own Fight Club's needs but here is the rules Tyler had come up with in the book and movie as a guide to help you with your Fight Club rules. Use these rules as a basis but don't be afraid to modify them based on your wants, needs, and safety.

You do not talk about Fight Club






You do NOT TALK about Fight Club






If someone says stop, goes limp, or taps out, the fight is over






Two guys to a fight






One fight at a time






No shirts, no shoes






Fights will go on as long as they have to






If this is your first night at Fight Club you have to fight






Fight Club will always be free (a rule added later in the novel)







, You must keep it on private property and hidden from the public eye so that the authorities cannot interfere. This will probably mean the basement or backyard of your house.
 Do the same with the amount of people you allow into your Fight Club.

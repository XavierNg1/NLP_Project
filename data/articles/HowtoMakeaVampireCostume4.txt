 Vampires are technically dead, so the paler you are the better. White face paint can be used to achieve that bloodless look, but it can seem fake if poorly applied. Use a make-up sponge to ensure even application. Blend the color well and make sure to extend the color down to your neck and chest if necessary. A subtler alternative is to apply a very pale shade of foundation.


Before applying any type of face paint, try slathering your face with a foundation primer or moisturizer. This keeps makeup from appearing cakey, especially if you have dry skin.
Apply a puff of powder over entire face to keep it in place. You can use white baby powder here to keep the white effect.
 For the perfect vampire makeup, you want a smokey eye. The trick here is to use eyeshadow for the smokey bits, over an eyeliner.


You can choose a dark gray, brown or black or have fun with aubergine. Any dark eyeliner and eyeshadow will do you.
Apply eyeliner on the inside of eye, on the top and bottom. Then take a dark eyeshadow and apply around the perimeter of the eye. Blend well.
 Apply dark red lipstick to create the appearance of having feasted on blood. You can even use red face paint or fake blood capsules to make it look like you have drops of blood around your mouth.
 The longer your nails are the better, file to a point if possible. Alternatively, you can apply false nails.


Opt for shiny, blood red lacquers or glittering blacks.
If you have a steady hand, try some nail art by painting on tiny white spiderwebs or black bats.

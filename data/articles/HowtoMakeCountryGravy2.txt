 Pour the oil into a small to medium saucepan and heat over medium heat.


Give the oil a few minutes to heat before adding any other ingredients. It needs to be sufficiently warm, yet not quite smoking.
Any standard cooking oil will work, including vegetable oil, canola oil, or olive oil. You could also use margarine or butter, if desired.
Skipping the butter and using oil makes this recipe vegan as well as gluten-free.



Rice flour and oil will form a roux, much like wheat flour and butter do.
You can use either sweet or regular rice flour. Both are gluten-free.
 Stir the rice flour roux constantly for two minutes or so.


You do not have to let the flour brown, but doing so will lend a nutty flavor to the country gravy.
Do not let the flour burn.
 Gradually pour the soy milk into the roux, whisking constantly so that lumps do not form.


Add the soy milk a little at a time. Pour 1/4 cup (60 mL) or so into the pan, whisk well, and repeat until 2 cups (500 mL) has been used.
Bring the mixture to a light boil or simmer. You may need to increase the heat of the eye in order to do so, but do not increase it past medium-high.
 Sprinkle with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and the remaining soy milk. Keep whisking until it reaches your desired thickness.


If the country gravy seems a little too thin, continue heating it at a light simmer. The liquid will gradually reduce, making the gravy thicker.
If you suspect that the gravy is getting too thin as you add the soy milk, you do not need to add the full remaining 1 cup (250 mL).
 Remove the country grave from the heat and use while still fresh and warm.

 The artist or band should fill out the form that appears on the "submit music page." This sends your basic details about you and your recording to the team at CD Kiwi. This is the first point of contact so the more detailed and accurate information you can supply, the faster your music can be set up on CD Kiwi.;
, They may request any further information that is required, such as a detailed music bio for the album/s and the amount you want for your CD (wholesale cost). CD Kiwi will inform you of the retail price that the CD will be listed for. CD Kiwi will also give you delivery details for you to send your CD to. The first CD sold on CD Kiwi covers the cost of setting up the listing. Following the first sale you will receive the wholesale price for each CD sold.
 When CD Kiwi receives the CD the team will scan the cover artwork and begin setting up the listing. If you have requested a specific track to be a sample for your album the CD Kiwi team will upload this also, and customers will be able to sample your music. You will be able to view the listing and make any comments if necessary.
 Although this is not a requirement of CD Kiwi, the more you promote your own music and mention that it is available through the CD Kiwi website, the more chance there is of selling your music. CD Kiwi can supply a link for your MySpace site so that fans can access your CD directly. CD Kiwi encourages all of its clients to promote CD Kiwi and increase site traffic for the benefit of all the artists listed.

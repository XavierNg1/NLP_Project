 Try to wait until you know your friend is doing something important, like on a date or at work, and that s/he will have his or her phone.
 This is the quickest way to send rapid-fire texts. Hold one thumb over the "send" button and use your other phone to randomly tap letters, numbers, symbols or emojis.


Alternate between thumbs, quickly tapping a letter with one thumb, then tapping send with your other thumb, almost like playing a video game.
Send as many messages as you can for as long as you can. The longer you text bomb, the more annoyed the person will be., If you actually want to say something and not just send as much gibberish to your friend as possible, break the message up and send it word by word. Don't worry about spelling--you still want to type and send as quickly as possible.


Try sending the lyrics to an entire song, word by word.
Send the same word over and over again. Connect with your inner two-year old and respond to everything they say by texting "why?" again and again.
If you are sending the same message repeatedly, save time and copy and paste into your text box instead of typing it out each time.
 To prevent the person from retaliating, temporarily block their phone number from your phone. They will get even more annoyed when they realize they can't text you back to yell at you or to get you back with their own text bomb attack.

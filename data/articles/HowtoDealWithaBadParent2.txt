 If you enjoy physical activity or would like a reason to exercise, a sports team is an excellent way to get out the house. Furthermore, team sports encourage teamwork, discipline, and cooperation. If you excel at sports, you may even be able to earn a scholarship., If sports are not your thing, auditioning for a play or joining the drama club may be a good fit. If you have an outgoing personality, a part in the school play may be perfect for you. If you don’t see yourself onstage, there are also many behind-the-scenes roles (like stage crew or lighting design) that you might enjoy.
 If school really isn’t your thing, you probably aren’t going to want to spend more time there. Another option for getting out of the house is to secure some part-time employment. An after school job is wonderful for teaching you punctuality, responsibility, and time-management. Best of all, it can put some money in your pocket, which you can save up to enable you to move out when you become old enough., Maybe your life is stressful enough and you don’t want to create more work or take on additional responsibilities. That’s OK! Simply spend more time outside of the house hanging out with your friends. Go see a concert, visit a museum, or take a walk around the park. Time with friends can reduce stress and boost your mood while getting you out of the house., Another healthy way to spend time outside of your house is to visit your other family members. Do you have grandparents, cousins, or older siblings that live near-by? Take some time to go and visit them. You may want to discuss your problems with them, or maybe not. In any case, spending time with family is sure to lift your mood and help you cope.

The completed "snow man".
 Place the snowman straw on a plate so everybody can grab their favorite one. Put the straw into the hot cocoa (warm cocoa, if serving young children). They might just eat the snowman before it ever reaches the hot chocolate!

If you wish to present the snowman already in the hot chocolate, make the snowman so that he sits at the top end of the straw and the base of the straw sits in the hot chocolate. Otherwise, he'll pull a Frosty, and melt right in front of you!

 Cut open a disposable diaper and remove the white granules; these are made from sodium polyacrylate. You can also buy it in powder or granulated form from the soil treatment section of a garden supply store. Powder makes fluffy "snow," while the granules create slushy "snow." Mix in water little by little until you obtain the desired consistency









This may look more realistic if you put it in the freezer.
If it dries out, just add more water. If you want to keep it dry, reduce the amount of water and add salt.
 This melts quickly, so it will only work in a cold room. Pour the crushed ice in a big bowl, then stir in white paint. Add water slowly until the snow reaches the desired consistency.
 With a cup of water and a string, you can grow your own salt crystals. The longer you hang the string in the water, the larger the crystals will be. Arrange these to form clumps of sparkly snow.
 You can use paint to make a surface look like it's been covered with snow. Dip an old brush into any type of white paint. Keep your thumb on the bristles, facing toward the surface. Rub the bristles gently to spray the paint onto the surface.









Don't use a nice new brush, since rubbing the bristles will damage them.

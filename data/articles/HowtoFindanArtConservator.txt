 Know what you have and how old it is. If you have been unable to do this on your own, consult with museums or find curators or other professionals that may know. Many can help identify art from good digital photos.;
, Start a folder for each object and keep all documents together like receipts, certificates, historical notes or labels, and old photos. Learn how to take good digital photos yourself and include some sort of scale in the picture, or record measurements in three directions. You should be documenting your collections for insurance purposes anyway. Take close-up pictures of maker's marks, interesting details or damage for future comparisons.
,, A good appraiser can give you an idea of market value, but only you can decide if it is worth it to you. Some things to remember are that artworks often become important heirlooms to later family members. Broken/damaged art usually has little market value and can be reminders of painful events. Finally, if we own important historical or artistic works, it is our duty to look after them properly.

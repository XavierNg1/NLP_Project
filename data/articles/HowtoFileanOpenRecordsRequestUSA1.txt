 To find the federal agency that you need to send your request to, go to the FOIA.gov website. The FOIA applies to federal agencies, but not to courts or Congress. Your request must be sent directly to the agency with the documents or information you need.


The FOIA doesn’t require agencies to do any research for you, or to create records in response to your request. It’s your responsibility to make sure you are asking the right agency for records and that the records you’re asking for actually exist.
Search the agency’s website before you file an FOIA request and confirm the information you seek isn’t already publicly available. A lot of information and resources can be found on an agency’s website and could save you time and effort.;
, To get the records you want to see, you have to send the agency a written request describing precisely the records you want and the way you want them delivered to you.


There is no specific form mandated by the federal government for making a request under the FOIA.
The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP) has an online system where you can create a customized request using an automated generator. The RCFP’s system is available free of charge., If you registered and created your request using the RCFP’s FOIA website, you can send your request to the correct contact through the website and monitor its progress using your account., Generally, requests made under the FOIA are completed within 20 business days. Each agency has an FOIA Public Liaison that may be able to assist you with your request.


If the records are complex, you want a significant amount of records, or the agency is dealing with a large amount of requests, it may take longer.
If the agency needs an extension, you’ll receive written notice giving you the opportunity to modify or limit the scope of your request, or agree to a longer processing time.

 This is one of the fundamental kicks that is extremely effective. Sometimes it’s called a turning kick or an angle kick. Make sure your target is lined up with the side of your body.
 Most instructors will tell you to turn your standing foot inwards towards your core when beginning your round house kick. The power of the roundhouse kick comes from the rotation movement. This occurs on the ball of your foot. It takes great balance. Practice this spin several times before attempting your first round house kick.
 This movement will be very quick and will give your kick a little more power. As soon as you’ve pulled your leg in, you’ll release it.
 The angle at which you extend your leg will be determined by the height of your target. This will be done in the middle of your spin.
 Be sure not to make contact with your toes. Doing so will hurt you more than your opponent.








Do not use your heel to make contact.

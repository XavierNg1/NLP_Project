 A snow fort one is perfect but if there's no more of them or you ran out of gems, simply buy a den you think is perfect for winter. A fantasy castle, Crystal Palace or Small House is still good.;
, Items such as snowmen, jamaaliday den items or simply ice things will add the wintry look. Avoid using anything that doesn't relate to winter, such as wolf sconces or various plants. Recommended items are anything white or blue, snowy items or anything that you think is wintry enough.
 Arctic wolves, foxes, normal wolves, snow leopards or polar bears suit the wintry look. If not, use any animal you choose but make it look wintry enough so people can see.
 A furry hat or star hat (for nonmembers) is worthy. Jamaaliday scarves count. A parka, old blanket or Winter Jacket suits the look. Finally, use snow boots or snow trail shoes (if not, use any leg item you think suits winter).
 Go to Jamaa Township while it's busy and begin to call jammers over to your den. Say something like "Winter fiesta at my den, come while it's still cold!" or "Winter party at my den, tons of wintry fun" to grab attention. Never say anything like "Winter party at my den, its so popular Julian2 was there and stuff!!!" People will fall for it but will realize the truth at the end.
 Play party games with some jammers, hold contests or simply chillax. If the number dwindles, just call some buddies over to regain popularity or relax and celebrate with your friends till you're tired.

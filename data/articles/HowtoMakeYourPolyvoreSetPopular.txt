 The better it is, the easier it will be to promote.;
, In choosing the groups:


Make sure they are relevant.
Try to choose a mixture of specialised groups, for example, punk, and general groups, everyone on Polyvore.
Choose semi-popular groups with a few hundred members; it they're too unpopular, no one will ever check the page. Equally though, if they're too popular, your set will be knocked off the 'recent sets' section too quickly.
 Change it perhaps every two-four weeks.
,,,, When you make your set, put # (hash tags) on them so when people search for the relevant word, your set/collection/group will come up.


For example, if your set has a day dress in it put #daydress. Make such it relates to your set.
 Add someone like @shans10, for example. Then that person will see your set, thank you for the tag and look on your wall. People may then tag you back!

,


For example, don't make an outfit with a bland t-shirt and skinny jeans. Polyvore is used to be creative, not show what you wear every day.
Let's be honest, those sets with items far apart, photographs that aren't incorporated well, and overused (and ugly) fonts and background colors are eyesores. Use only photographs with muted colors in the background to make it visually appealing but not distracting, and try using newspaper articles and quotes to make it look cool. When you aren't putting anything in the background, try to organize your items so that they fit well together, like pieces of a puzzle.

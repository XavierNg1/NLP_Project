 What makes this a good exercise is that you have to react with your body in very unpredictable ways, on uneven footing, while making cuts, ducks, jumps, bobs, & shuffling of the feet. The key to a successful session is to run fast! Yes, the faster you run the harder adapting will be. Interestingly enough, your mind will be so preoccupied with this live video game that you won’t even notice how winded you're getting! You can make this drill harder in a couple of simple ways:


Try putting on an eye patch. This creates a major deficit in depth perception.






Try this wearing sunglasses, giving you less distance vision in a shady wooded area.






Simply add ankle weights, that will throw off your innate sense of timing.

, You can switch up to make it fun and interesting for both of you. Begin at about 10 feet (3.0 m) apart and use a soft rubber or foam ball. Start slow, then as you get better, have the pitcher increase his velocity and get closer. Here’s a short list of some variables you should use to continually make dodgeball more challenging and fun:


Use multiple throwers.
Start with eyes closed and have the pitcher cue you before he throws.
Thrower can disguise his toss with "feints."
Color code balls: Red ball = catch, blue = dodge, green = strike. These force you to recognize as well as react.
 Throw and catch. Make this more difficult by: increasing your velocity, standing closer to the wall, progressing to smaller balls, switching catch/throw hands, and starting facing away from the wall, throwing the ball over your shoulder then turning around at the sound of it hitting the wall. You can buy a "reaction" ball that looks like an odd, uneven bouncing ball that can go in any given direction.

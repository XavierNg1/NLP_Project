 If you want a decorated room, the least you should do is make it neat! Through away things you don't need, put things away, or simply make your bed. Sweeping, dusting, and mopping are pretty important since you would certainly want a junk free room!;
, A small room is limited in use. Not much can be added except the bed, dresser, and night tables, and of course a desk and computer. Most second bedrooms are of this size.


Find out about the tastes of the girl. If the girl likes fairies, you can add little hanging stars made of thermocol, or paint white pieces of cloth with golden, pink, green or red.
, It might be a hobby that you enjoy, or an animal theme, if you are an animal lover. It's your room, and your choice.
 Use two matching colors, and continue using these and blending in a third in your curtains and bed spreads, sheets and towels (if you have your own bathroom).
 Sometimes just a few new articles that fit the color scheme can make a great difference, and not be costly.
 This may seem useless, but it is key to a neat room. You can simply toss your trash in your bin instead of putting it in drawers! If you wish, the trash can could be decorated to suit your theme.
 These can be posters, photographs, unique lighting, pets and any other special mementos. Make sure you like it.
 You do not want anything to break or get crumpled! Always buy the best if possible and/or appropriate materials for your room.

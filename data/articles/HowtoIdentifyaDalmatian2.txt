 Dalmatians are considered a large dog breed with a strong muscular build. The average Dalmatian is about 20-24 inches (50-60cm) tall at the shoulders and weighs 48-55 pounds (22-25kg). Dalmatians have a deep chest and thin tail. Their feet are round with arched toes and the toe nails can be either black or white.In order to measure the height of a Dalmatian, use a tape measure and record the distance from the ground to the top of the dogâ€™s shoulders.
 The head of a Dalmatian has a similar width and length and the top is flat. Their nose can be black, dark brown, blue or grey and their eyes are brown, blue, or a combination of both., Dalmatians can vary in size based on the individual dog. It is for example, possible to have larger or smaller Dalmatians. This is typically a result of environmental and care factors. For instance, a Dalmatian that is overfed may appear much larger than the breed standard.
 There are a variety of applications available that can identify different dog breeds. In order to use these apps, upload a photo of a dog and the app will identify the breed.For example, try the Microsoft application called Fetch!
These apps are not always 100% accurate, but the Dalmatian is fairly easy to identify because of the unique spots.

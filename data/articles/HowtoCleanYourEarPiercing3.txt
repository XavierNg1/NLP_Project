 Germs and bacteria can collect on the earrings themselves. Clean your jewelry 2-3 times a day to help keep them clean until your infection clears., Use a cotton balls or swab. Dampen the swab with alcohol, then place on the ear lobe all around the piercing. Discard the swab and repeat for the backside of the ear lobe.
 Do this each time you clean the posts, before you put the earrings back on. You will only need a small amount of ointment. The antibiotic ointment will help fight the infection and heal your ear.
 Most infections can be resolved at home with cleaning and ointments. If the infection doesn't clear up in a couple of days, you will need to consult a dermatologist to prevent it from spreading.

 Use a comb to divide your hair into two sections – one at the crown of your head and one with all the rest of your hair. Take the top section of your hair and French braid it down the center of the crown of your head.Keep braiding until the braid has formed a complete circle.
Secure the braid with an elastic and tuck the end underneath the braid. Use bobby pins to secure the braid.
Take the other section of your hair and French braid that around the circumference of your head.
Use an elastic to secure the braid, then tuck and pin that braid under the braid you made at the top of your head.
Add any additional pins you might need to help hold the braid in place.
 Use a tail comb to create two hair parts, one over each eyebrow. Separate the two sections of hair and secure them to your head using a clip.Take the center section of your hair and braid it straight back away from your face.
Start ½" back from the hairline so the braid will have a little poof at the front.
Tightly braid the center piece all the way down the curve of your head, then secure the braid with an elastic.
Tuck the braid under the rest of your hair and use pins to secure it.
 Start by parting your hair down the middle. Separate your hair into two loose ponytails and secure them with elastics. Split each ponytail in two and braid each section. By the end, you should have four braids.Use scissors to remove the two elastics holding the two ponytails.
Pin the two large ponytails so they crisscross at the nape of your neck.
Wrap one of the braids into a bun, then secure the bun with a pin.
Wrap all the other braids around that bun, securing each braid with a pin.
By the end, you should have one braided bun.

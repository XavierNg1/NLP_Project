, If it's less that 3/8", you will probably have to use metal as a dowel rod will break too easily., This is for anchoring the wire as you wrap. This step is not essential but makes making jump rings much easier., Then begin to tightly wrap the wire around the dowel rod towards the opposite end of the slit., Once you have wrapped enough wire on the dowel, you have several options for cutting the wire into jump rings.

One of the easier ways is to slide the wire off the rod and use parallel wire cutters to cut the rings. The drawback here is rough, sharp ends that often need to be filed/sanded.
If you are using a wooden dowel, you can also use a jewelers saw with a 2/0 blade: move the wire up the dowel to the end, hold the dowel steady and saw a straight line through it. It is also handy to wrap a single layer of masking tape around the wire so that the rings don't fall everywhere. Slowly move the wrapped wire up the rod until you are done.

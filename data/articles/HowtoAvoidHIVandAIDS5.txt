 If you have been exposed, or fear that you have been exposed, to infected fluids, you may be able to take post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP, an anti retroviral drug. This medication, when taken immediately after exposure (or up to 72 hours after) can drastically reduce the chance of becoming infected.


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that only HIV negative people who have recently been exposed to HIV use this drug. Abusing this drug can result in serious health risks. While this drug does not cure HIV, it can, if used properly, prevent someone who has just been exposed from contracting the virus.
 Two to four weeks after being infected, people who are HIV+ often, but not always, experience flu-like symptoms. This is called ARS (acute retro-viral syndrome) and is described as the "worst flu ever." The person may experience fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and a rash. These symptoms may last up to 4 weeks.If you notice these symptoms get tested right away.
 Testing is the only way to actually know your status. When you get tested, you will most likely be given a blood test, although urine or a swab of fluid are also used. The results will come back in a few days or in as little as 20 minutes, depending on where and when you get tested. If you test as HIV+, meaning you have the virus, receive treatment as soon as possible.

 Adjust your fingers so they are towards the inside portion of the contact lens, and are not covering or touching the edges. There needs to be enough room for the contact lens edges to move., Be sure not to smash the lens. The point is not to test the integrity of the lens, or the limits to which it will bend. You just want to see what shape it makes when you bend it.
 If the edges point straight upward, like the eponymous taco, it is correctly aligned. If they squeeze or round outward, like the head of a vase, then the lens is inside out and should be reversed .


If you squeeze very tightly, a correctly oriented contact lens will bow enough the edges will curve towards one another.

 Choose any color you want. Using a ruler, make each thread 28 to 30 inches (71 to 76 cm) long for a bracelet; add length for an anklet or necklace.;
, Lay out all three threads evenly. Grab the middle of the bunch (make sure it's the middle by seeing if the bottom threads line up). Pinch the threads about two inches down from the center point with your other hand, so that the bundle looks like one thread. Make a loop with the bundle, then pull the rounded center of the bundle through the center. You should have a small loop of thread above the knot, and six threads coming down from the knot.
 Use masking tape to attach the small threads coming out of the knot to a table or counter, or put a safety pin through the knot and attach it to the top of your jeans (while sitting down). A secured knot will help you maintain consistent tension.
 Separate your threads into two even groups, with three threads on each side. Take the threads on the right (pink in the photos) and loop them over and under the threads on the left (blue). Then put the pink threads through the loop you just created around the blue threads. Pull horizontal pink string and blue string keeping them parallel to your knee or the table, and vertically on the pink threads, keeping them perpendicular to your knee or the table. As you do so, the pink knot should move up to your large knot at the top. This is called a cross knot.
 Loop them over and under the pink threads, then pull them through the loop.
, Leave about 2 inches (5 cm) of untied thread at the bottom of your bracelet, keeping each tail one color. For each color, make a three-strand until you have about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) of free thread left. Tie an overhand knot at the end of each braid.
 Draw one of the braids you just finished through the loop above your top knot, then tie it to the other braid in a double knot. Your friend should be able to remove it at the end of the day with one hand.

 Online vegan wine guides offer lists of wines that are suitable for both vegans and vegetarians.;
, Several vegan wine distributors offer 100 percent animal-free wines from different countries. Many individual winemakers also have websites from which you can purchase vegan wine directly. Keep in mind that many places sell vegan wine in bulk; and because it is heavy, you may end up paying more in shipping costs.
 Using the list of vegan wines you found online, look for the brands at your local wine store or supermarket.
 Look on the Internet or in a directory for wineries and vineyards local to your area. Many small wineries produce vegan or vegetarian wine, and will allow you to come to the winery and sample wines, as well purchase them.
 Look for wine that is labeled as unfiltered or "unrefined." Many smaller wineries will produce unfiltered wine for its organic properties, which also means that there will be no animal additives, since there is no filtration process used in the making of the wine.

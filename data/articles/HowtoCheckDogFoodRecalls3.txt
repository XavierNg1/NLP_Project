 If you have been feeding your dog a brand of food or treats that have been recalled, stop feeding them those items immediately. No matter the reason for the recall, you should not continue feeding your dog the food or treats.Contact the manufacturer if you have questions about the recalled product.
 Many times, foods are recalled because they are contaminated and can harm your dog. This means you should take your dog to the vet if they have ingested any of the recalled products. Even if your dog seems fine, take them to the vet just to make sure.Your dog may have been poisoned by the contaminated food or treat and show no symptoms. It is better to get them checked out than to risk your dog getting sick or even dying.
Watch your dog closely until you are sure all of the recalled food is out of their system.
 If you recently bought a recalled item, return the dog food containers or treats to the store. Many stores will give you a full refund since the product has been recalled.If you do not want to return the food, throw it away in a secure container so no dog can get to it.
 After your dog’s food has been recalled, make sure to wash all of the dog bowls and other dishes the food may have come in contact with. Clean around the dog’s eating area and change out the water, too.Some recalls may be due to bacteria or other contaminants, like Salmonella, which can not only make your dog sick, but your family as well.
Wash with hot water, soap, and a bleach solution.

To add multiples of the same object, right-click on the object. Click on the "Offer x" option to select the number you wish to offer. If you want to remove an item from the trade, just click on it in the Offer window and it will be removed.
 Then press the green Accept button. If you change your mind, just hit the red Decline button.
 This gives you one last chance to check the trade you are about to complete. Make sure you are happy with what is being offered. Then press accept for the last time.
 There is no way to reverse a trade once it's completed. Some players may try to trick you by saying they'll give information in return for items, or promising to give the item right back to you. It's best not to trust offers like this.

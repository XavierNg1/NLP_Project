 This method will provide a sweet, tasty iced coffee with up to 67% less acidity than hot-brewed coffee. Cold brewing also eliminates some of the bitter, undesirable traits you get from hot-brewed coffee.;
, Put measure of coarse ground coffee to suit your taste into a pitcher. A full bodied darker roast will give you a richer coffee flavor.
 Pour nine cups of cold or room temperature water into the pitcher.
 Cover the pitcher, and let it steep for at least twelve hours in a cool place.


After steeping, you must separate the grounds from the water.
 Decant the coffee by pouring through a fine-meshed sieve, into another container.


Place a coffee filter (two paper towels work too) in the sieve and carefully pour the mixture through to separate the last of the grounds.
You are left with a sweet, full bodied, coffee concentrate.
 In a glass, add a desired amount of ice, and one part coffee concentrate to three parts cold water or milk. Add sugar if desired. For easier mixing, use simple syrup in place of sugar.

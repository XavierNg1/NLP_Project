 Show them that you care about their well-being.


Even greeting people in the hall at school with a simple, “Hi, how’s it going?” shows that you aren’t entirely self-involved.
 Being a leader means being responsible not only for yourself, but for others, as well.
 Clothes can help you be a more confident person. You don’t need to have the most expensive threads, but if you wear things that make you feel comfortable, you will appear more confident.


If you don’t know what kind of clothes you like to wear, take a friend shopping with you and try out some new looks!

If you struggle with acne, be sure you are using facial wash that helps to prevent acne. Visit a dermatologist if you can.
While caring for your hair and nails might sound “girly,” know that girls notice these details. If you have short hair, be sure to visit your barber when your hair begins to grow over your ears or looks unkempt. (If unkempt is your style, go with it!) Trim your nails regularly, and cut—don’t pull—any hangnails.
 Often, people have a first impression of you based not on what you say but on what your body says. How you position your body says a lot about you. Stand tall with your shoulders back, but don’t look stiff!Don’t close off your body by crossing your arms or legs. This type of body language says: “Leave me alone!”, Don’t be that annoying person who always talks about doing something but never does it. Just go for it!

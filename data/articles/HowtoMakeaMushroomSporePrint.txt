 The mushroom must be mature to ensure that it has enough spores to print. A freshly picked mushroom is more likely to have live spores than a store-bought one.


If parts of the mushroom cover the spores, the printing effect won't work as well. Avoid using mushrooms that are shriveled, bruised or appear old.
Flat mushrooms create the best prints.;
, If the cap is very large you can cut it and make a print of just a part of the mushroom.
 Cover the mushroom with glass or bowl. Although it doesn't need to be clear, a clear glass covering allows you to help determine when the print is done.
 When you think it's ready, remove the bowl and view your print.


The print is actually made by the many microscopic spores falling from the mushroom, leaving a near-photographic impression.
 Use the print for hanging artwork, gift wrapping, adding to another craft project or to create more art from.


To protect the dusty print, spray with spray fixative, such as hairspray. Several coats should be adequate. Be careful though, as the pressure from the spray can easily disturb the spore print and change its shape.

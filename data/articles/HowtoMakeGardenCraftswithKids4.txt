, You'll need a cup (or a mug) and a bowl, some markers, paint and any other decorative items (optional). You'll also need some glue suitable for ceramics. The bowl and the cup can be purchased from a thrift store if you don't have old ones at home to spare. The paint must be suitable for ceramics.

Check the the bowl sits in a nicely balanced way over the cup or mug before proceeding; it must be a good fit.
 Paint the bowl one color and the cup or mug another color. Allow to dry fully, then paint another layer for a smooth look. Allow to dry. If needed, paint one more layer for good measure.,

For the bowl, paint large round circles in a different color at varied intervals across the bowl. These will appear like mushroom spots when the fairy house is put together.
For the cup or mug, paint a door and two windows. The door should be centered away from the handle and begin from the open end of the cup or mug.
 Carefully glue the bowl (open end facing down) down onto the solid end of the cup or mug. Allow to dry. This forms the little fairy house., If wished, you can twist a piece of artificial plant around the handle to cover it up. A small chimney could be glued on; use a small block of wood (paint it first). Other decorative elements can be glued on, such as pieces of lace for curtains, etc., This will provide a layer of protection for the fairy house. Allow to dry overnight., Let the kids decide where it's best placed.

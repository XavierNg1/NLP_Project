 This will select any data between the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner of the data group.


If you're selecting one row, just click the right-most cell with data in it.
If you're selecting one column, just click the bottom-most entry with data in it.
 It's in the "Styles" section of the Home tab. Doing so will prompt a drop-down menu.

 You'll see a window pop out from here.
 It's at the bottom of the pop-out menu. Clicking this option will select all duplicate values in your selected range.

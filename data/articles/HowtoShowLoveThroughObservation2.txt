 Affection is an important way to say “I love you.” If your loved one has had a difficult day, offer a hug, pat on the shoulder, or another form of affection. Reach out with affection when the person looks like they may appreciate it. For example, they may enjoy a hug after a big presentation or a shoulder rub after a long week.Notice when they ask for affection, then begin to anticipate when they may want it.
 If you notice your loved one needing help with something, step in. especially if they need something a bit complicated (like help with taxes or putting together furniture), your willingness to help will show that you’re willing to put in some effort to support them.If they have many grocery bags and seem flustered, stop what you’re doing and help bring them inside the house. Don’t ask if they need help, step in and start helping.
 If you see your loved one doing something nice, show that you noticed by leaving a note. Notice the small things and let them know that you appreciate them. Put the notes somewhere they can see, such as on the table in the morning. Or, you can hide them places so that they can find them as a surprise, such as in their lunchbox or backpack, underneath their pillow, or in their shoe.


For example, leave a note that says, “I was tired last night and you were very sweet to make dinner and clean up. I really appreciated it!”
For a child, say, “I saw you being nice to your sister and sharing. Good job!”

 First, turn your oven on to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (191 degrees Celsius). While that heats up, get a large baking sheet ready for your crackers. Dust it with a light layer of all-purpose flour to prevent your dough from sticking to the sheet., Add your rolled oats to your blender or food processor. Pulse them several times, checking for consistency in between each pulse. Stop once they appear finely chopped., Add the following dry ingredients to the blender or processor: all-purpose flour; salt; ground black pepper; chopped rosemary leaves; baking powder. Then chop up your cold butter into small pieces and add those, too. Continue to pulse a few times to form a coarse, mealy dough. Then add your milk and pulse for roughly 15 seconds without pausing., Place the dough on your baking sheet. Then roll it out with a rolling pin until the dough is about an eighth of an inch thick (0.3 cm). Use a knife to cut out 60 crackers, slicing all the way through the dough. Spread them out so there is about an inch (2.5 cm) between each one., Place the sheet in the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat once the bottoms turn a light brown. Allow them to cool on a rack to room temperature before serving.

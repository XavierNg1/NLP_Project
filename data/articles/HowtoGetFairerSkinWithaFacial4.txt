 This type of deep pore cleansing facial will clear and brighten skin and can be particularly beneficial for someone suffering from hyperpigmentation (a condition in which patches of skin become darker than the surrounding skin). Choose a skincare professional that will both treat and advise you. At a minimum, he or she should ask how your skin responds to sun exposure and question your habits regarding sun exposure. Ask for a consultation. Describe what you hope to achieve from a professional lightening or brightening facial, and discuss your options.
 Ensure that he or she is willing to describe to you what substances are used in your facial and the results you can expect.


Look for natural ingredients, such as vitamins like vitamin C, A, and B3. Fruit acids like glycolic acid are also commonly used and have been shown to work well. , Avoid any treatment that uses hydroquinone, which is not uniformly safe and has been banned in Europe and is under examination in the USA. This chemical may cause cancer, rashes, and may even ultimately darken the skin. NEVER allow the application of any product that contains mercury. Mercury can have a negative impact on your kidneys and nervous system, but is still used in some skin care products. A reputable and trustworthy professional will never use a facial product containing mercury.
 Be prepared to repeat these professional facials on a regular basis to maintain these results.

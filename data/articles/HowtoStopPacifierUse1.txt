 Remember that your child has formed an attachment to their pacifier and giving it up may not be easy for them.;
, When they ask for it, tell them that they can have it later. Try to reassure them that they are okay without it and move on to another activity.
 To keep them from thinking about their pacifier, give them something else to do and avoid a fit or a fight that might make you feel like giving in to your toddler.
 Bedtimes and nap times should be the last instances you wean your toddler off the pacifier, as they are probably the times your child will ask for it the most.
 Help them find other self-soothing methods, like hugging a teddy bear or sleeping with a special blanket.

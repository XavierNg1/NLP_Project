 You will need to combine pale shellac along with several other ingredients to create your sealing solution. These ingredients can be bought at craft stores or a pharmacy and are as follows:


Pale shellac 5 oz
Borax 1 oz
Water 1 pt
Flat tray (deep) or wide mouth bowl
Tongs, You will need to allow your paper to dry after you treat it with your solution, but errant drops of shellac can possibly do damage to your flooring or fixtures. Allowing the paper to hang dry over newspaper is a suitable way to dry your waterproofed document.You might also consider a wire drying rack with wax paper place underneath.
 Bring your water to a temperature just below the boiling point, as you would when poaching or scalding a food in water.Introduce the ingredients one by one to the water, stirring thoroughly until the solution is even., The bonding process of your ingredients may have left some impurities in your solution. The more impurities in your solution, the cloudier it will be, so you should strain your solution through a fine mesh. If your solution looks relatively clear, you can strain it right into your tray or wide mouthed bowl.Cheesecloth or muslin are excellent choices for straining your solution, if you don't have a fine sieve available.
 Now that your shellac sealant is in a bowl or deep tray that allows for easy dipping, take your paper in your tongs. Dip the paper quickly, but completely, in your solution, and then allow your paper to dry at your drying station.

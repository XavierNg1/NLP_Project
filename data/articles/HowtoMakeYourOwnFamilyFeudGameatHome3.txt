 Two players, one from each team, give what they think is the most popular answer. The player who picks the highest scoring answer gets to decide if their team will take control of the board or pass it to the other team.
 The players on the team in control each take turns guessing answers. The players are not allowed to talk amongst themselves. The host reveals correct answers on the board along with the number of responses it received.
 If after 3 strikes the board has not been fully revealed, the opposing team has a chance to steal the points for themselves. The team is allowed to confer, and if they can guess one of the remaining answers, then they win the points.
 For example, an answer that had 15 people select it would be worth 15 points.,

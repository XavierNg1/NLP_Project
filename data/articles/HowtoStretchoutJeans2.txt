,, After about 15 minutes, you should feel it relax and loosen around you.
 Pull on areas that you would like to loosen while you are in the bath, such as the waist band or inseam. Use your hands to keep stretching the fabric for about 10 minutes.
 This will prevent you from splashing blue-tinted water all over the bathroom floor.
 Get out of the bathtub, place a towel on the floor and do some stretching exercises, such as squats, lunges and forward bends to loosen the seat of the pants. You could also do some yoga positions.
 Lie on the towel and read a book, or go outside and air out in the backyard, while you allow the jeans to dry on your body for at least 30 minutes. As the jeans dry, they'll conform to your body, stretching to fit your curves and bends.
 Do not put your jeans in the clothes dryer, or they will shrink again.
 Repeat your squats, lunges and other exercises for at least 5 minutes after putting them on, and they should get even looser.









You will need to repeat this procedure the first few times you wear the jeans. Over time, jeans tend to stretch out and conform to your body.
In the future, hand wash your jeans and let them air dry, instead of running them through the washer and dryer. They shouldn't shrink up again.

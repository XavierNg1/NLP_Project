 Fill a medium stockpot with 2 inches (5 cm) of water. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat and bring the water to a steady simmer.


Make sure that the steamer basket fits inside the mouth of the stockpot. The basket should be able to rest over the lip of the pan without touching the bottom of the pot.
 Place the baby corn in the steamer basket, then set the steamer basket on top of the stockpot and over the simmering water.


Try to arrange the baby corn cobs into an even layer to promote even cooking.
 Cover the steamer and stockpot with an appropriate lid. Steam the baby corn until it becomes slightly tender.Check for doneness by piercing the corn with a fork. It should be easy to pierce, but it should still retain some crispness. Past the “tender crisp” stage, baby corn can become soggy and unpleasant.
 Remove the baby corn from the heat and serve it while it's still hot.


Consider serving the baby corn with butter or a drizzle of olive oil.
Store leftovers in an airtight container in your refrigerator. Use within one or two days.

, In 2000, Chris Jericho mocked Stephanie McMahon in the "McMahon-Helmsley Era". From calling her nicknames to throwing food, he made sure that she would get more attention than just being "Daddy's Little Girl".

 Chris Jericho.... a.k.a. "Moongoose McQueen" is the lead singer of the heavy metal band, Fozzy. Fozzy has 3 albums out.
 In 2005, Jericho had an "Loser gets Fired" match with John Cena, lost the match, and was escorted out by security. The departure was for real, as he wanted some off-time from wrestling.

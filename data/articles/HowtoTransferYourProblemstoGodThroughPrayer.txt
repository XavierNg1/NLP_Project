 Prayer was His idea; His way for us to come and communicate with Him. God encourages it, and even commands it! "Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving" - Col 4:2. "Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints" - Eph 6:18;
, We come to God as we would to our Daddy, for when we accept Jesus as our Savior we are automatically His adopted children! Our heavenly Father cares for us and takes us on... we are His to enjoy, protect, and provide for just as our earthly father does.
 "He that comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of them that seek Him!" Reading Scriptures about prayer will build your faith, for we have the promise that He will hear us and answer us. John 15:16b - "That whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, He may give it you."

, They work together. In John 14:13, Jesus said: "And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son."

, Mark 11:25 - "And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses." If you don't forgive others He will not hear you!

, Actually do it! He will hear and answer; but only if you pray! Unburden yourself. Speak freely and honestly about everything that troubles you. Ask for His help! Ask for His forgiveness! Ask for His direction in your life! Pray until you get relief and feel His peace come to you.
 He has it! No sense in being anxious any more. Know that He is working all things together for your good in this situation.

 If you are planning to sign up for a new card, learn as much as you can about the rewards system. If you have the card already, contact customer service and request any information they have about their rewards program.


Be sure to find out what purchases are eligible for earning rewards. You may be surprised by some of the restrictions.
 If your credit card is paired with an airline or a hotel, then your points are most likely earned with that company rather than the bank. Cards that are not paired with another company will only earn points with the issuing bank or credit company.Points earned through a second company (like an airline or hotel) are safe when you cancel, but points earned through a bank will be lost.
 Earned miles or points may differ in value from one credit card company to the next. Ask your credit card company directly to find out exactly what your miles are worth. You can also look for websites that list point values from various credit cards.Many credit card miles are worth 1 cent. This means that if you have 40,000, you can redeem them for a ticket that costs up to $400.

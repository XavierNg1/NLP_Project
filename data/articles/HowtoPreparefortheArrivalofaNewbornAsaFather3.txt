 If you’re going to play an active part in the birth of your baby, find out exactly what that role will entail and how to prepare for it. Ask questions of your partner, doula, and/or midwife. If you feel uncomfortable taking on an active role, tell your partner as far ahead as possible so that other arrangements can be made., After babies are born, it is common for one parent to become the primary caregiver for at least a few years. Talk to your partner about which of you will be staying at home with the child and which of you will be the family’s breadwinner. There is no right or wrong way to make this decision, but usually, whoever earns the most continues to work while the other parent cares for the child.Additionally, discuss other responsibilities like who will do the wash, make dinner, get up in the night to feed the baby, and so on.
 If you and your partner both decide to head back to work after your newborn arrives, discuss who will care for your child during the day. The most economical option is to ask your parents (or your partner’s parents) to help out. You could also hire an experienced babysitter or shop around for a daycare center.Finding the right infant care center or provider can take time, so begin the process early.
 After giving birth, some women have a reduced interest in sex. Men, on the other hand, continue to experience sexual desire. Let your partner know that you are not angry or resentful about the temporary decline in your sex life. Express your willingness to give your partner time to recover from giving birth.This disinterest in sex usually lasts three months or so.

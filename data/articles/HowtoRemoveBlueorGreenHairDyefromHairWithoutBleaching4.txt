 Exposing yourself to some natural sunlight over the course of a few days can also help to fade your hair color. Try going for a daily walk in the afternoon when the sun is at its brightest. Make sure to use sunscreen on your skin and do not spend too much time outside in the sun or your scalp may get burned., Cover the colored hair with lots of "strong hold" hairspray. Sit in the sun for as long as possible. Then brush out the hairspray, wash with an anti-dandruff shampoo and condition well to restore the hair's softness.
 While exposure to chlorine will not strip your hair of color immediately, going swimming in a chlorinated pool and exposing your hair to sunlight will begin to fade your dye.However, you should always wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner after you have gone swimming. Do not expose yourself to so much sun that you end up getting burnt, as this could lead to skin cancer.

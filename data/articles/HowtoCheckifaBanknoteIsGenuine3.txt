 In certain banknotes like the 20 and 50 Mexican peso banknotes, certain parts of the banknote will change colors when the note is tilted. Other notes include motion (TM) strips that produce 'moving' images when tilted.
 Some banknotes, like the Malaysian 10, 20 and 100 Ringgit notes, have a very thin fluorescent layer. This usually appears on the reverse but can also be on the obverse. This appears only when tilted in a fairly bright light.
 Some banknotes do have a silver layer or patch that produces multiple images when tilted ( for example, the 1 Bahraini Dinar banknote).
 Tilting makes it much easier to see them with a naked eye.

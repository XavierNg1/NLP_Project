 Rather than lining up directly in front one another, position yourselves so that the center of the woman's chest lines up with the inside of the man's right shoulder.
 The man should place his right hand flat on the small of the woman's back and hold his left hand out to the side at chest level. The woman should place her left hand the man's shoulder, raise her arm to chest level and extend her hand out to the right to hold her partner's hand. Hands should be interlocked like two C's rather than held with fingers intertwined.
 A good guidelines is three to six inches of distance between you to your partner. Be sure your arms are relaxed with a comfortable bend in the elbow and your knees are soft rather than locked.
 The man is meant to lead in a slow dance, so gentlemen should begin by shifting all weight to the right foot. Then every time the music hits the "one" of a four-count beat, shift your weight to the other foot. As your weight shifts, pick up the opposite foot and put it down in a slightly different spot so that you don't stay rooted to just one location for the duration of the dance. Move clockwise.

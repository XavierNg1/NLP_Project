 Keep your friends around you and spend plenty of time with them. Talk things through with your most trusted friend or friends but don't go on about the excuse or the breakup with people in your wider circle, as it can be overkill and make everyone feel worse. Instead, let everyone know that you're free to spend time with them again and that you are up for activities together.
 For moral support, don't go to events alone when you know he will be there too. Tell your friends that you're worried you might feel weak in his presence and say or do something you might regret and have them monitor things for you.


Have a friend on speed dial in case you need to quickly talk about your feelings in the case where you accidentally bump into your ex and feel like taking things out on him or crying in public.

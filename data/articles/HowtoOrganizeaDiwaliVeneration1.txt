 List the people you are going to invite for the Diwali veneration. Let it be a wide circle including your friends, family and relatives. Since this is a celebration of victory, for once ignore the negative relationship between your friends or family and include them in your guest-invited list. This might even help you to befriend each other and settle things that are heated up among you.;
, The venue, time/ date should be arranged according to everyone's comfort. Choose an appropriate venue and time when no one would be busy.
 Prepare an invitation card or buy some and send them to the people you want to invite specifying the venue, time/date e.t.c. Send them through post or hand it over personally. Calling and informing them is also a good idea.
 Check your groceries, catering items e.t.c are up to date. If not, then its time to go shopping and update it so that you won't run out of anything at the last moment.
 Place an order before hand for enough chairs, tables e.t.c and store them away until the day of the occasion. A day before the occasion is the best time to place an order.

 This is another way of working with one form of the equation of the line to get another form.



You are working where m = -2 as the slope of a line and the coordinates of a point are (4, -3), and these are our (x1,y1) like any defined point on the line. So, using those given values we have:y - y1 = m(x - x1),y - (-3) = -2(x - 4), by substitution using the point and slopey + 3 = -2(x - 4), by simplifying -(-3) to + 3y + 3 = -2x + -2(-4), by distributiony + 3 = -2x + 8, by multiplyingy + 3 - 3 = -2x + 8 - 3, by subtraction (of equals from both sides of the equation)y = -2x + 5, by simplifying/rewriting it (That fits the y = mx + b called the Slope Intercept Form).

What is Point–slope Form based on? The point-slope form expresses the fact that the difference of y values for two points on one line (that is, y − y1) can be stated as directly proportional to the difference of x values (that is, x − x1). There is a proportionality constant called m (the slope of the line).

We find that Direct Proportion is a comparison that can be stated in a form similar to y = kx. Here we notice that y - y1 = m(x - x1) fits the form y = kx .
Direct proportion means that given two variables such as x and y, then y is called directly proportional to x, if there is a constant k such that y = kx, if and only if x is not zero. "k" is the proportionality constant which is just the slope as we are using it. (You can also express direct proportion by saying "x and y vary directly", or express that "x and y are in direct variation").

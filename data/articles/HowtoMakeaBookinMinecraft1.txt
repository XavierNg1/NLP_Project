 Sugar cane is a green reed that grows near bodies of water. It can be difficult to find on some worlds, but if you follow a coastline you should come across it. Break it with your bare hands or any tool to pick it up.


Sugar cane does not grow next to frozen water. Look for it in warm biomes.;
, Since sugar cane can be annoying to find, save some to plant before you turn it all into paper. Placing a piece of sugar cane on the ground will plant it, but it will only grow taller in the following conditions:


It must be planted on dirt, sand, grass, or podzol.There must be at least one water block adjacent to the ground it is planted on.

Note — to harvest the cane, just wait until it grows taller and break the top blocks. If you leave the lowest cane block it will keep growing.
 Fill one row of a crafting table with sugar cane (three in total). This makes three sheets of paper, which is enough to make one book.
 Cows are usually not difficult to find, while horses spawn only in plains or savannah. Each one killed will drop 0 to 2 units of leather.You'll need one piece of leather for each book.


You can also make leather out of four rabbit hides, or find it occasionally by fishing.
If you want a steady source of leather, grow wheat and use the harvested stalks to lure cows into an enclosure. Offer a pair of cows more wheat to breed them whenever you're getting low on animals.
 Place leather in one square and paper in three squares, anywhere in the crafting area. This makes one book.

 Although bream can approach 6 pounds (2.72 kg) in size, most bream are less than 1 pound (0.45 kg), which means you can get away with a relatively light set-up. You can best enjoy fishing for bream with light or ultralight tackle, with a spinning or spincast rod from 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8 m) in length and a reel designed to handle from 2 to 8 pound test (1 to 4 kg class) line.


You can also do a decent job with a cane pole of 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) in length with an 8- foot (2.4 m) or longer line tied to its tip. Fly fishermen can also fish for bream using a 3- or 4-weight rod and matching line.
 While large baits and lures are appropriate for large fish such as bass, walleye, and pike, small baits and lures are appropriate for panfish such as common bream, bluegill, redbreast, and redear sunfish. Fishing for bream with corn and maggots is also common.If you prefer live bait, crickets and grasshoppers work best, but where they're not available, try red worms or pieces of nightcrawlers in warmer weather and wax worms or grubs in colder weather. Use long-shanked size 8 or size 10 hooks and weight the bait with a light sinker. Attach a small slip bobber to your line.If you prefer artificial bait and fish with a spinning or spincast rod, try tiny jigs such as the Lindy Little Nipper or the Bass Buster Beetle in weights from 1/32 to 1/16 ounce (0.89 to 1.78 g). If you fly-fish for bream, try small poppers, rubber-legged nymphs, or foam-bodied spiders.
 Lure-fishing for bream is commonly done with the use of a bobber, as well. You can fish leisurely and slowly by using a small slip bobber, or more quickly with an attached safety-pin spinner, such as the Bass Buster Beetle Spin. Experiment with several colors to find which one works for you on a given day, in the environment in which you're fishing.

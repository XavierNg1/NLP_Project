 In other words, you are using your index finger to hold down the E and B strings on the first fret. Use the pad of your finger to cover both strings with only one finger.


Try rolling your finger slightly back towards the headstock, so you're pressing down on the side of your finger instead of the fleshy part. This section is a little harder, making it easier to fret with.;
, In other words, use your middle finger to hold down the G string (third from bottom) on the second fret.
 In other words, use your ring finger to hold down the D string (fourth from bottom) on the third fret.



If possible, lightly touch the fifth (A) string with the tip of your third finger -- this mutes the string so it can't be heard while strumming. While not essential now, this is an great technique to practice as you continue playing guitar.
 Once all of your fingers are firmly in place, practice picking the bottom four strings until each note rings clearly. Pick each note individually to make sure they all sound out clean and clear.











If you hit a bum note, readjust your finger placement until you can play it clearly. The first and second strings are usually the most problematic -- check that your second and third fingers are curled directly onto the appropriate strings, rather than lying against the ones underneath.
Once you can play each note clearly, practice strumming the F chord. Also, practice changing from F to another chord, then back again. You may be painfully slow at first, but you'll eventually get the hang of it.

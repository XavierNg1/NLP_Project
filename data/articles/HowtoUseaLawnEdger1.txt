 A stick lawn edger is usually a wooden or metal pole (like a rake handle) with a semi-circular (or square) blade at the end. It looks a little like a straight hoe or a very small shovel.


This is a manual tool and it’s best to apply pressure using your foot, so make sure you are wearing solid-sole shoes or boots when using the tool.
It’s best to do this when the ground is fairly moist as it will be easier to cut through than dry earth. Avoid edging your beds in winter when the ground is likely to be frozen hard and difficult to work.;
, To use a stick lawn edger, mark out where you want to make the new edge of the lawn. Stick the edger in the ground to a depth of about 2 inches (5.1 cm).


Put your foot on it, holding the stick firmly. Push down with your foot to cut through the soil. You can rock gently to cut through the turf. Push the handle forward and back slightly to loosen the cut edge away from the rest of the turf.
It’s helpful to pry the cut area open slightly so you can see where you've worked. Now move the tool blade a few inches to the side and cut the next piece away. Continue until you have edged the entire bed.
 It’s best to check manufacturer’s instructions for your particular model. In most cases your power tool will have two settings: one to trim the grass and one to trench edge or cut the turf.


In some cases you can set the depth to cut. Make sure you get the settings right before you begin.
You’ll need to mark out the area to cut in a way that is visible when using the bulky machine.

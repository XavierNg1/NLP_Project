 Your job as a coach is to motivate players and to ensure they perform their very best. Being an effective coach means answering any questions players have.
 The more you know about softball, the rules of the game, proper form required in hitting, pitching, fielding, running and stealing bases, the more you educate players and teach them how to develop these skills. This ensures maximum performance.
 Keep in mind that every player's skill level is different. While there are a few players who are skilled way beyond their years, there are also players who are just learning how to play. The important thing is to treat players equally.
 Treat players equally and never show favoritism towards a particular player. This creates resentment and distrust among other players and creates disharmony within the team.
 Prevent from making rude comments or snide remarks to other players on the opposing teams. Always try to remain positive, even when the outcome doesn't.

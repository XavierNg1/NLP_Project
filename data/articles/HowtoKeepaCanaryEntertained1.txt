 Canaries may be small, but they need roomy cages to flap, hop, and fly to their heart’s content. A canary cage should be at least 16 inches (41 cm) tall and 30 inches (76 cm) wide.Avoid cages with a rounded shape, as these can restrict how much the canary can fly around. They may also make it difficult to hang perches correctly.;
, Canaries are active birds, and they may enjoy interacting with your family. Keep the cage someplace with plenty of interesting activity. A living room or home office may be ideal.While canaries may enjoy watching humans, many do not like to be held or handled by humans. Let the canaries watch you, but try not to bother them.
Put the cage in an area with plenty of light but no direct sunlight. It should be well-ventilated with no drafts blowing on the cage from vents or windows.
Keep the cage about 6 feet (1.8 m) off the floor, either by hanging it or setting it on a stand.
 Canaries will be happiest when they can flit from one perch to another. When placing perches in the cage, adjust them so that they are different heights. This will give the canary multiple flight paths.Choose perches between 3/8 inches (9.5 mm) and 3/4 of an inch (19 mm) in diameter.
Keep a few different widths of perch inside the cage. This will reduce foot discomfort for your canary.
 Canaries do not require as many toys as other birds, but a few interesting objects will help keep them active. Avoid crowding the cage. Two or three toys will go a long way. Good toys for canaries include:Mirrors.
Plastic balls.
Swings.
Sticks with leaves on them.
Bells.
Vine balls.
Tightly-wound ropes.
 You can attach a bird bath to the walls of the cage or place a small bowl of cold water inside. Your canary will splash and bathe in the water when they need a quick refreshment.If your canary does not use the bath, try filling a spray bottle with cold water, and gently spritzing them with it instead.
Change the bath water every few days or whenever it becomes cloudy and dirty.

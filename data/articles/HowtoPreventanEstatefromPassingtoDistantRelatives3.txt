 In some states, your estate will never pass to distant relatives. These states have passed “laughing heir” statutes. A laughing heir is someone who hardly knew you because you were so distantly related but who nevertheless could inherit your property if there isn’t a will or a trust.In a few states, the “laughing heir” statute prevents the estate from passing to someone more distant than a first cousin. Accordingly, if your state has a “laughing heir” statute, then you don’t have to do anything to prevent your estate from passing to distant relatives. Instead, if there is no close relative to take the estate, the estate will go to the state.
You can meet for a consultation with a lawyer to find out if your state has a laughing heir statute.
However, even if your state does have this statute, you should still think about writing a will or creating a trust. Doing so gives you more control over who receives your property.
 There may be other ways to prevent your estate from passing to distant relatives. You should schedule an appointment with an estate attorney and discuss your options. Only an estate attorney can offer advice tailored to your circumstances.

When you have the name of an attorney, call and schedule a consultation. Ask ahead of time how much the attorney charges.
 Some trusts are more complicated than the revocable trust discussed in this article. If you have a complicated estate, then you should talk about what other kinds of trusts you could create to limit your tax exposure.


You can always draft a trust to keep it from going to distant relatives, so you should never have to worry about that.

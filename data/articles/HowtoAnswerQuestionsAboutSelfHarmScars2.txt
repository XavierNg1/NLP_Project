 If you’re faced with a question about your scars but don’t want to tell the truth, a white lie can sometimes take the pressure off. Blame your scars on an accident or mishap that happened long ago.This only works if your scars look like they could have been caused by an accident.
For instance, if you have rows of scars that were clearly caused by self-harm, people probably won’t believe your story that your cat scratched you.
 You can take the pressure off yourself and build rapport with the person who’s talking to you by turning the question back around to them. Acknowledge your scars, and then say something like, “Do you have any scars?” or “Have you ever gone through a time that caused you a lot of pain?”This approach is especially effective with children and teenagers, since it helps them relate to you.
 A light-hearted approach may be a best bet if you feel awkward about discussing your scars with strangers or loose acquaintances. In such situations, you can shake off the question humorously.


Say something that obviously isn’t true, such as, “I fought a dragon when I was a kid.” Laugh it off and change the subject as soon as possible.
Of course, self-harm isn't something to make light of, but this may be your only route to take if you'd rather not disclose personal info to a person or group.

, When an enemy comes rushing up to you just unload your assault rifle's magazine on him/her. This will lower their shields and create enough damage to your opponent for your kill shot.


Quickly change to your secondary weapon and finish the kill.
Strike your opponent when their shield and health is down. It only takes one melee strike from your weapon to kill most opponents.
 After that just shoot them. It only takes about roughly 23-27 bullets to kills a Spartan with full shields, and about 13-20 bullets to kill one with their shields down.
 If you are shooting from medium range with the Assault Rifle shoot in short bursts. It will kept recoil to a minimum while retaining accuracy and saving your ammo.

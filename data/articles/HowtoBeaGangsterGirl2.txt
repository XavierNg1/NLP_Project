 Appropriate the traditional 1920s mobster look for feminine use. Start with something like the classic, double-breasted pinstripe suit. Add black shoes and an elegant tie, as well as a fedora.
 Wear the same bold red lip and smoky eye that Jazz Age women did. Either tie your hair back in a tight bun (to better accommodate a hat) or try loose finger waves.
 If your suit has a breast pocket, add a flashy handkerchief. Pin a bright flower on your lapel for extra feminine effect. If you're planing on taking off your jacket, add a slim pair of suspenders over your blouse.

 Dot eyeliner has become so popular that almost everything has been road tested already, including using more than two dots. For instance, you can create the first two dots as you normally would, then add one (or even two) more right beneath those in descending size. It creates a fade out effect that can look really cool., Break all the rules and go wild with your placement! Start with the typical two dots beneath your eyes, and then add them at the inner and outer corners of your eyes, too. This can create even more emphasis on your eyes and yield very interesting results. Try using a metallic shade at the inner and outer corners., There are no rules when it comes to makeup, especially when you’re experimenting and having fun. If you’re a makeup lover, you may have already seen this look floating around on Instagram. Create the first two dots in one color. Use another color to make smaller dots beneath that. Use yet another color beneath that, then add dots at the inner and outer corners of your eyes in the third color.You can also try a more monochrome approach. Create the first dots in a dark color, then the next dots in a lighter shade of the same color, then dots in a shade that’s lighter still.Create the dots in descending size for a fade out effect in both size and gradient.

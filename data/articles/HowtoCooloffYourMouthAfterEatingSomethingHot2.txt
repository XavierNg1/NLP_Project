 Use an ice cube instead of ice water, since water will lose its chill quicker. Hold the ice cube in place over the burned area, either with your fingers, tongue, or teeth. Keep it there for as long as the ice lasts, or until the burning sensation has faded away for good.

If all you have is cold water and no ice, by all means, use that instead.
Ice pops, yogurt, pudding, applesauce, or any other soft treat from the fridge or freezer will provide relief, too., Coat the effected area. If you’ve burned your tongue, stick it out of your mouth so the toothpaste can dry. If the burn is elsewhere inside your mouth, breathe through your mouth to help it dry the best you can. Then rinse your mouth out.Use a mint toothpaste that’s free of fluoride.
Other products with mint (gum, chocolate, breath mints) will also provide a cooling effect.
 Cool the burn with the flow of air. Work up some saliva to coat your tongue. Then stick it out into the cooler air. Draw breath over your tongue and exhale the same way to soothe the burn with the air current.If you’ve burned underneath your tongue, touch the the tip of your tongue to your upper lip as you breathe. This way your inhales have a better chance of drawing air over the affected the area.

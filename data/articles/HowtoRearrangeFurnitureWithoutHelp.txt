 Heavy pieces should be taken apart if possible to lighten their weight and prevent pieces from falling off while you move them. Remove shelves from bookcases, cushions from sofas, drawers from dressers, and hutches from desks, for example.;
, Some pieces of furniture may have fragile or delicate parts, like the glass top of a coffee table or the doors of a china hutch. Before moving these pieces of furniture, you may want to wrap a blanket or bubble wrap around the fragile components.
 Furniture sliders are small pads, usually made from plastic and rubber, that can be placed underneath furniture legs for easy sliding. These are crucial for moving furniture alone, as they allow you to avoid straining to lift bulky furniture and scratching your floors by dragging furniture across them.
 Another option that allows you to slide furniture across floors without damaging them is using blankets. Stuff thick blankets underneath the legs of a piece of furniture before sliding it to its new location.
 Perhaps the safest and most effective way to move large pieces of furniture alone is by using a hand truck or flatbed dolly. When using a hand truck, position the furniture as vertically as possible so that the weight bears evenly onto the hand truck. Dollies should be placed against walls when loading them so that they do not roll away.
 Once you have got the furniture moved and you want to adjust their locations slightly to perfect the arrangement, avoid the temptation to simply drag the furniture that last little distance. This can easily damage your floors or your furniture. Instead, carefully lift one side of the furniture and move it slightly. Then, lift the other side and move it a bit, and repeat this process until the furniture's location is perfect.

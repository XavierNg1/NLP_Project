 To clean the pipes with vinegar, you'll need to let them soak. If you are just trying to clean copper fittings, you can fit them in a 5-gallon (18.92 ml) bucket. Otherwise, place your pipes in a bin that's large enough to hold them.
 Make sure that the pipes are immersed in the white vinegar. If they are not, you may need to pour additional white vinegar into your bin.White vinegar contains 5% acetic acid, which helps remove oxidation and hard water deposits., As the pipes sit in the vinegar, the acetic acid will start to remove oxidation and hard water deposits inside and outside of the pipes., Use a sponge or a cotton cloth to gently work away any remaining hard water deposits or soap scum that hasn't dissolved in the vinegar. At this point, the acidity in the vinegar should loosen up any stuck on calcium deposits., Run your cleaned pipes under cold water from a hose or faucet to remove any remaining vinegar.
 Wipe down the pipes individually until they are completely dry. Apply heat with a hairdryer if you're having trouble drying the inside of the pipes. Your pipes should now be shiny.

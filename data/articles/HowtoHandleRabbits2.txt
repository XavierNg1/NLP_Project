 Rabbits often resist being picked up by scratching and clawing. This can cause you to drop your rabbit and hurt it. Wear a long sleeve shirt so that your rabbit won’t be able to hurt you., Your bunny will want all four feet securely pressed against you, either your hand or body. So, it is good to place one hand underneath, securing all four feet against your arm, as if the bunny were standing on your arm.Place your thumb around the rabbit’s side and your forefinger around its chest to hold it secure.Never try to pick up your rabbit by an extremity, like its ears, tail, or the scruff on the back of its neck.
 Your arm should reach around your rabbit’s back and across its body. Press it against your chest, to hold it securely., If your rabbit isn’t socialized and resists being held, you might need to hold it somewhat tightly against you. However, if your bunny is cooperative, you can reduce its stress levels by holding it more gently against you., When you are done with your rabbit, slowly bring it closer to the ground by squatting. Do not lean over and drop your rabbit suddenly. Place it on a surface that is ground level, flat, and not slippery., If your rabbit squirms or scratches when you hold it, you can put a towel around it to protect yourself. Throw the towel over it and then scoop it up, wrapping the towel around the bottom of the rabbit.

 Brew your coffee however you normally do in the mornings, whether it’s with a coffee machine, a French Press, or a Keurig, but make sure it’s extra strong. Pour it into a pot with your schnapps and crème de cacao, turning the stove on medium to low heat. Let it heat slowly until it’s hot., Once you’ve allowed your mixture to heat, you can pour in the cream. Continue to stir constantly, and let your mixture heat up again. Take a careful test sip to check the taste, and add ingredients however you see fit. Once you’re satisfied, carefully pour your drink into a coffee mug., This beautiful, holiday-themed cocktail is not complete with all the trappings. Add whipped cream, a few mint leaves, and pop a candy cane on the rim for a festive touch. If you want, you can even drizzle a bit of chocolate syrup over the whipped cream. Serve or drink immediately. Enjoy!

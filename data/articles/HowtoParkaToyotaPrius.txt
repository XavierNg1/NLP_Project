 Turn on your turn signal when you are ready to park.;
, Will this parking space best be suited to need to be parallel-parked or does your Prius need to be parked in a parking space in a parking lot?

, Mentally ask yourself: Is the space big enough to accommodate your vehicle? The Prius is considered to be the same size as a midsize-car, but can be a little weird to judge if you just bought the car recently.
 Look for snow, rain, hail/sleet and puddles of water. These may force you to stop or slow your speed sooner than normal into a space.
 Downgrades or upgrade hills can cause you to find other places to park. Use the car's parking brake if you feel that the car might roll away from its parking space later.
 Do this if you come up from behind the spot at no more than five miles per hour.
 Do this if you are trying to parallel park the vehicle. Unless you are more accurate than your vehicle's sensors, try allowing Intelligent ParkAssist to help you parallel park your Prius.
 Use this when parking the Prius the "old fashioned way". The Prius is an automatic hybridized transmission-styled (CV) automobile, and all steps that apply with other cars, apply with the Prius.
 Backing into a spot is tricky, and with the price of the Prius being as high or more as it is, you want to avoid disfiguring and breaking your car's bumper system.

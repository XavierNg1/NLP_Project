 Unlike most fabrics, you don't want large scissors. Instead use small, thin scissors. Embroidery scissors are great, but toenail scissors should work fine as well.
, This is why you need thin scissors. If you do this correctly, you will get almost no fluff floating around., Use berry pins or glass headed pins, not ordinary pins, so they won't get lost in the fur., Use lots of pins, about 5cm (2 inches) is a good distance between pins - too far between, and the fur is likely to be caught in the seam., If you are using a sewing machine, the tip of the pin should almost touch the machine's foot before you remove the pin. But make sure you don't actually sew the pin.

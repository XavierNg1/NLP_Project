 Yes, they exist, but often the main component is some form of acid which can cause the fumes to be toxic or semi-toxic. The rust removers can be purchased at any hardware supply store and some auto body shops.


Some optional brands include Evapo-rust, Metal Rescue Rust Remover Bath (safe on paint, plastics, and skin), Acid Magic, The Works (20% HCL, hydrochloric acid), The Works Basic (9.5% HCL, hydrochloric acid) and WD-40 (light weight oil).
Use protective wear when handling commercial rust removers. Protective wear includes goggles, gloves, and a face mask or respirator.
 This is where the rubber really hits the road. You want to give the cleaners time and elbow grease to work their magic. You can do this in several different ways:

Some chemical solutions come already in a spray containers. Spray lightly and accurately onto rust and let sit overnight for heavy rust.






Other solutions need to be applied by using a brush. Scrape off any rust that can be easily removed and evenly apply the solution. Let sit overnight.






Another method is total submersion. If an item is small enough, find a plastic paint bucket or other container and place the rusted item in it. Pour enough rust remover solution to completely submerge it and let it sit overnight.
 Try to get as much of the commercial rust remover off your item as possible. Hit the item with a blowdryer, if possible, so that the item is completely dry and rust is discouraged from returning.
 Most of the rust should have been loosened overnight and the remainder should come off easily.
 The amount of wait time necessary to remove the rust depends on the item in question, how badly it is rusted, and how well the store bought product works. Sometimes the metal needs to be treated with the solution more than once, particularly if the rust is on a vertically standing object.

 While many families across the country will be planning back yard barbecues and outdoor social gatherings to enjoy a three-day weekend, it is important to remember the true meaning of Memorial Day, which is to honor and remember soldiers who served this country. This year, why not incorporate a special remembrance into your holiday weekend plans?;
, Renting a projector for the weekend can serve many purposes, including social gatherings and solemn memorials. 

, Regardless of an individual’s political position or beliefs, Memorial Day brings people together to acknowledge the service of these men and women who have died in service to their country.
 This need not be a depressing memorial, but rather, a celebration of life and the contribution of the individuals being honored.
 You may even choose to invite neighbors and friends to contribute digital images of soldiers from their families and social circles. You may also choose to include people that you and the other participants knew, who were killed in the 9/11 disasters.

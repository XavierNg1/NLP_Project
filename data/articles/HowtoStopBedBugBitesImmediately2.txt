 Pesticides are not that effective against bed bugs, so dousing your bed and room in one is not going to be that helpful., If you think you have bed bugs, the first step is to call a professional exterminator. You simply don't have the skills and tools you need to take care of the problem completely., The professional is going to need to get in and around most of your room, including headboards, baseboards, carpets, and your mattress and bedsprings., Watch carefully to make sure the professional is getting into every nook and cranny. He or she should be able to spot where bed bugs could be hiding, but you may need to point out hidden areas., Exterminators can heat up your rooms to very hot temperature to kill the bed bugs, which you can't do on your own. Ask the professional about performing a heat treatment., If you live in an apartment complex, you need to talk to management, as bed bugs may be spreading from apartment to apartment. When one apartment is treated, the apartments directly above, below and on either side should be treated at the same time.

 The constellation Orion, the Hunter, bears a resemblance to a bent hourglass. The stars Betelgeuse and Bellatrix represent its shoulders; the stars Saiph and Rigel represent its knees (or feet). The three stars in the middle, Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka, represent Orion’s belt.


In the Northern Hemisphere, Orion is visible chiefly in the winter and early spring, but can be seen late at night in the fall or before sunrise in the summer.
 Look for one moderately bright, one dim, and one fuzzy star hanging down from Alnilam, the middle star in Orion’s belt. This represents Orion’s sword, which points to the south.The fuzzy “star” is actually the Great Nebula of Orion, an interstellar nursery where new stars are being formed.

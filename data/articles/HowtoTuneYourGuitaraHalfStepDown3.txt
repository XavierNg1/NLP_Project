 Capo's are easy tools that help shift between different keys. They're usually used to play in a different key or voice, without changing the tuning. When the capo is on the first fret the low E will instead be an "F."


You'll tune the guitar into standard tuning, which is a half step lower than the first fret. Then when you remove the capo, you'll be tuned a half step lower.
 Tune the first string down to an E. If you are using a piano, play an E note and match the low E string to that note. Take it slow and make sure the notes are synchronized.This can be a good technique if your tuner is not chromatic. Chromatic tuners hit all the notes including sharps and flats.
 Go through each string either using a tuner, piano, or your ear. Play a standard E chord and check to see if everything sounds tuned.
 After adjusting your tuning, you should now be tuned down a half step. Play an E chord after you've removed the capo., Go through each string within a chord, and make sure it sounds in tune. Rely on your ears, but you might need to use a tool.

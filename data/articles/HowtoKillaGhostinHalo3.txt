 There is no protective covering for the driver on the back, not counting the hood and small rear piece. A Ghost has two guns which shoot pretty fast and do moderate damage. It also has a 'Boost' feature, which allows you to go fast for long periods of time.


Note: You cannot shoot while boosting, but you can boost as long as you want; there is no recharge or limit of how long your periods of boosting can be.;
, Usually, the driver of a Ghost will be a Grunt, so it won't be that hard to kill it. A Ghost's driver is exposed at the back of it, behind the hood. This is very hard to do with a sniper or battle rifle.
 You have to get close to the Ghost to do that, but if you are close enough hit the RB and you will jump on it, kick/punching the driver out, and hopping in. Usually players hide somewhere until it gets close or until it sees the player. Then players jump out.
 The second a Ghost sees you, it will shoot at you and/or some closer. If you notice a Grunt noticing you, immediately throw a Deployable Cover/ Bubble Shield. It will defend you while also defending allies. Another good thing is that if the Ghost really wants to get you, he will drive throw the Bubble Shield or around the Deployable Cover, and get next to you to shoot. This is good because you can then easily board it.
 Get behind a wall or something, then jump out, fire a few shots at the driver, then get behind the wall again. If this killed the driver, good for you. If it didn't, the Ghost will see you and come to your wall. You can then board it.
 It should blow up the one you threw it at, plus a few others. A Frag would kill the one you threw it at, the Plasma would do that and possibly the one next to it, a Spiker should take out at least three.
 Besides killing the driver. If you shoot at the Ghost itself enough, (with a machine gun or other powerful weapon) it should explode, damaging anything next to it as well. This is also the result of throwing a grenade at it.

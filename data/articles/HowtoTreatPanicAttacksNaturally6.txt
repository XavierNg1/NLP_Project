 One of the most awful things about panic attacks is feeling out of control. Symptoms of a panic attack may include: increased heart rate or palpitations, chest discomfort, sweating, nausea, dizziness, cold chills or hot flashes, feeling tingles or numbness, feeling out of breath, a choking sensation, shakiness or jitters, feeling outside of your body and fear of death.Often people worry or feel that they may be having a heart attack.


Not being able to control the attacks makes them all the more worrying. When will the next one come? Where will you be? Will you be able to cope? These worries can help make the next attack a self-fulfilling prophecy.
 The reality is that around 1 person in 20 suffers panic attacks (National Institute of Mental Health figures). This may even be an underestimate, because lots of people either don’t get properly diagnosed or don’t seek treatment.


It's often a great help just to know that you're not alone, but that is only a first step to treating panic.
 Panic attacks are the result of the body’s “fight or flight” mechanism being triggered. Usually a person’s first panic attack is caused by something particularly stressful or during a particularly stressful period in their life.


The problem is that the sub-conscious mind has overreacted to a perceived threat. It triggers the “fight or flight” mechanism to protect us. In the past this might have helped us escape from a saber toothed tiger. Unfortunately, our minds aren’t good at telling the difference between a build-up of day to day stress in our lives and a life or death situation.

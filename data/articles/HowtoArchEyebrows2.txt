 Follow the directions that come with your waxing kit to see what temperature and method are needed to heat the wax correctly.


Test the wax on the inside of your wrist before you apply it to your face, to make sure that it is not too hot.
Liquid wax is easier to use than wax strips because they allow you more freedom of application.
 Before you start waxing, it is important to make sure your skin is ready. Remove any makeup you have on that is around your eyelids and eyebrows.









Pin your hair back so that strays don’t make their way into the wax as you apply it.
Some wax kits come with a pre-wax solution that you should dab onto your brows at this point with a cotton ball.
 Using the small plastic wand that it came with (you can also use a popsicle stick), spread the wax in a small section on your hair in the same direction as the hair grows.









Work in small sections no bigger than one inch across. This way the wax won’t dry too quickly, and you have the ability to make more minute changes.
Work with the wax from the inside out. Start at the inside corner of your brow at the top, and work towards the opposite end. Then repeat, starting on the bottom.
Wait a few seconds after applying the wax to let it set before removing it.
 Use pieces of muslin or pellon cut in small sections. Press the fabric in the direction of hair growth, leaving a small tab at the end.









Press the fabric firmly in the wax, to make sure that it is fully adhered. Make sure you stick it to all of the wax, so none gets left behind.
Wait a few seconds to let the wax cool a bit more, guaranteeing that it will remove the hair with the cloth.
 Using the small tab at the end, rip off the fabric in the opposite direction of hair growth. Do it as quickly as possible to minimize pain and help in pulling the hair out by the root.
 Continue until you have waxed all of the unwanted hair from around your eyebrow, and then move to the next eyebrow.

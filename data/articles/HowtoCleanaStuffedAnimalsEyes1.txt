Plastic eyes can be damaged by abrasive items removing ink or gouging into the plastic, and heat can melt it.
Glass eyes can chip, crack or break if mishandled.
 If just the eyes are the issue, simply spot clean them with one of the suggested methods.


If washing the toy as a whole in the washing machine and it has plastic eyes, place the stuffed toy in a pillow case before putting in the washing machine. The pillow case will protect the eyes.
It is not recommended that any stuffed toy with glass eyes, moving eyes or eyelashes be washed in a machine. Doing so will likely harm these areas of the toy.
 Alternatively, wash on a lovely warm day and air dry outside, under a porch or shaded area (being careful to avoid birds that might leave a mark).

 Fulfill the certain conditions needed to enter the bonus stage in the first place. Try to do this for each tag team and every level in case you do not succeed in some bonus stages.;
, This game is similar to that seen in Sonic the Hedgehog 2; you must run around a half-pipe for a limited time and attempt to get as much colored balls to get faster.
 In order to beat the stages, you must earn enough boost from collecting the balls to do so. However, the time and spike bombs (as well as the slippery controls) hinder you from doing so.
 Repeat the same process above and do this for other bonus stages in other levels in order to collect the six remaining emeralds.
 Enter this game mode to watch a long (it's very long) cutscene of the Heroes discovering that (spoiler alert) Dr. Eggman was being manipulated by Metal Sonic the whole time, who has copied the data of Sonic, Shadow, Froggy, and Chao, causing him to transform into Neo Metal Sonic.
 Each member takes out an emerald, allowing Sonic to become Super Sonic and create an energy shield for Tails and Knuckles. You will now have to beat Neo Metal Sonic (who is now a cybernetic dragon beast) to save the day and to ultimately beat the game.

 Users of Windows XP who have downloaded DirectX latest version by mistake will want to know how to rollback to a prior version. Microsoft provides no method for uninstalling DirectX other than to update to the latest version. Windows XP users can either download and install one of the third-party applications designed for this purpose or use the "System Restore" feature to return their operating system to its original state prior to installing the latest DirectX update.


Open the Start menu and select "Help and Support." Select "Undo Changes to Your Computer with System Restore" from the Pick a Task menu options. Check "Restore My Computer To An Earlier Time," and click "Next."
Select a date from the options provided that is prior to downloading the incompatible DirectX update and click "Next." Click "Next" again to confirm the selected date, and then click "OK" to begin the restore process. You have now rolled back to the correct version of DirectX for your system.

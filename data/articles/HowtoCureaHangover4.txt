 This is the best way to prevent hangovers. Remember that alcohol is a toxin, and that there is a reason why you feel so horrible after drinking it excessively.
 This will prevent dehydration, a major cause of most hangover symptoms.


If you forgot or were unable to have water in between drinks, be sure to drink a glass or two of water before going to bed.
 Stick with one, be it wine, beer, or a certain type of hard liquor. Mixing different types is a surefire way to end up with a hangover.
 Margaritas may be delicious, but all that sugar masks the alcohol flavor, making it easy to consume more than you realize you're taking in. The same goes for other cocktails made with sodas and fruit juices.
 It takes your body about one hour to metabolize each drink. Spacing out your drinks will help give your body enough time to recover from each one, dramatically reducing the likelihood of getting a hangover.

 One of the most powerful ways to expand your worldview and develop your own beliefs is by seeing new places. Oftentimes, your pre-existing belief system is built around your own narrow experience. When you see the world beyond your own community, your experience broadens, and so do your beliefs.Plan to explore as much as you can. Depending on your budget, this might include visiting new states, countries, or continents. However, you don’t have to travel far to get a new perspective. Consider taking a foreign culture course at your local college or visiting a museum in your area.
 When you engage with people who are different than you, you can learn more about their belief system. In turn, you may better inform yourself on what beliefs suit you best. Strike up a conversation with someone whose background is different than your own.They could have an alternative political perspective, be from a different culture, or have been raised with a unique lifestyle.
If you are too nervous to chat with others, you might start out reading books about people who lead different lifestyles.
 Exploring new activities and ways of being can push you out of your comfort zone. As a result, you may develop new beliefs about yourself and the world around you.


Challenge yourself to learn a new skill like salsa dancing. Learn another language. Eat in a foreign restaurant. Include different colors or prints in your wardrobe than usual., Many people’s belief systems are grounded in moral decisions of right and wrong. You can empower your own belief system by experimenting with different spiritual practices or religious beliefs.Visit a different church or place of worship. Start a meditation practice. Or, spend more time in nature.
This might be challenging if the ideas are drastically different from what you were raised to believe. Take your exploration slowly by finding small ways to explore (e.g. reading a book versus attending a worship service) until you feel more comfortable.

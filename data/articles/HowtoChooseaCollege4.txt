 Do you want a public university or a private college? A big school that is practically a city in itself or one which is very small? These things will determine the general feel of the environment, as well as the amount of help from professors is available to you. Some people may prefer smaller schools, some larger schools.
 For some people, the ability to participate in the Greek system (fraternities and sororities) is very important. Many schools do not have a Greek system, so look into that when deciding where to go.
 Ensure that the school and student population are similar to you and that you will fit in there. You won’t want to go to a school where you cannot feel included and welcome. However, it isn’t the worst idea to put yourself in a slightly different environment than normal (such as a public school if you have always gone to Christian schools). College is intended to challenge your views and help you expand your understanding of the world, something which is difficult to do if everyone around you agrees with everything you believe.
 Look into what clubs and activities are available at the schools you are considering. This will help you find out if there is potential for you to do the things you want to do and meet new friends with whom you have things in common. Examples of available social clubs and activities include anime clubs, dance clubs (where you can learn a variety of dance styles, often for free), film clubs, and sports clubs.
 If sports is important to you or plays a role in how you intend to finance your education, you will need to account for this. Find schools which offer sports scholarships and talk to them about what they’re looking for and how you can get on their teams. You may also just wish to play regular sports, in which case you will want to examine the available classes and clubs.

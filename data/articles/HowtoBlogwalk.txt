 Ideally, this should be a site that you've visited before and know you like.


If you have your own website, you might want to use it as your starting site.






If you don't have a good starting site in mind, do a web search on a topic you're interested in and pick a blog from the first page.





;
, There are a couple of places where you can find good links:


The site's links page or blog roll - simply a list of other blogs - will provide you with links that the site's owner thinks are interesting. Many of them will usually focus on a similar topic to the site you're starting with.






The comments section will have links to the blogs and websites of people who read the site. The content of these links may or may not be similar to the content of the site you're looking at. If you're starting with your own blog, checking out your readers' sites is a great way to get to know your readers and to thank them for looking at your blog.
 You can check out the first few posts, search for a topic that you want to read about, or just skim until you find something that suits your fancy.



If you have your own blog, this is a great way to create more links to your blog and get new readers. Most blogs allow commenters to list a website in the appropriate space in the comment form. So when you comment, anyone who reads our comment will be able to click on your name and go to your site.






Even if you don't have a blog, leaving comments on articles you enjoyed is a nice thing to do. It lets the author of the post know that you liked what they wrote.
 Use the same methods described in step 2.


If a post you liked on the current site was written by a guest poster with his or her own blog, check that blog out.






If you read a comment that you really liked, see if the person who wrote it has his or her own site.






If you hit a "dead end" - a blog with no links, blog roll, or comment links to follow, go back to the previous page you looked at and pick a new link.

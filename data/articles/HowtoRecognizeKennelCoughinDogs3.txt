 How poorly your dog is influences whether it is essential he is seen by a veterinarian or not. If he has kennel cough but is otherwise bright, has a normal temperature, and eating well (as is quite common) then he does not necessarily need to see the vet, other than to confirm the condition.


Fit healthy dogs will mount an immune response and destroy the virus within 7 to 21 days.
 In this condition, it is the coughing phase that is infectious. Other dogs can potentially pick up infection by contact with aerosol droplets on surfaces, so regular washing of floors (with dilute bleach) and bedding is advisable.


Anecdotally, not all the dogs living in one house come down with kennel coughâ€”it seems exposure to a low dose of virus and a healthy immune system are enough to see off infection in some dogs.
 The cough can be tiring for the dog, especially if it keeps him awake at night. It is fine to give a codeine based human cough medicine (a teaspoon/5ml per large dog, half a teaspoon for dogs under 10kg) at night.Do not attempt to stop the cough 24 hours a day because the cough serves to move mucus and bacteria up out of the lungs. However, it is ok to settle the cough at night so that your dog can get some rest.
 Always seek veterinary advice if you are uncertain the dog has kennel cough, if he:


Is lethargic
Coughing so much he vomits
Not eating.

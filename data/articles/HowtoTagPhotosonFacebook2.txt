 In order to tag photos you've already uploaded, you'll need to be logged in.


Navigate to your profile page by clicking on the icon with your name on it in the top toolbar, or by clicking on your name on the top left side of the page, next to the thumbnail of your profile picture.
 You can tag individual photos you've uploaded, or photos within albums you've created.Click on the photos tab, located on the toolbar next to your profile picture. This will take you the page where your photos and albums are visible.
Select either Your Photos or Albums and locate the photo you want to tag.
Click on the photo to expand it.
Click the Tag Photo button, located at the top right side and bottom of the photo.
Click on the face you want to tag. A search bar will open. Type the name of the person you want to tag. Once you've started typing a list of names will appear in a dropdown menu. You can either select the name from the dropdown menu or continue typing and press enter.
If the person you wish to tag does not have a Facebook account you can still tag them, however the tag will not link to their profile and the tag text will appear in black (instead of blue) font.
 It's possible to tag more than one photo in an album at a time.Select the album.
Press the Tag button in the top right corner of the album page and enter the name of the person you want to tag in the search bar that appears above the album photos.
Click each photo you want to tag with that name. Place your cursor over the face of the person and click.
Click Save Tags at the top of the album page when you are done.
Repeat this process for each person you want to tag in the album.

 If you are playing as Trevor and are looking for some extra cash, you can drop the drunk drivers to the Altruist camp for a quick $1000.
 Drive over to Armadillo Avenue or La Puerta District during the day and interact with the drunk driver there (either the solo man in La Puerta or the drunk couple in Armadillo Avenue). Their location is indicated by a blue blip on the map when you’re in the area.


Once you’ve interacted with the drunk driver, you’ll have to drive them using their car.
 Rather than driving the drivers to their destination, you can follow the map to reach the location on the map marked as “A.” , Once you reach the Altruist camp on Mount Chiliad in the northwest part of Los Santos, you will be rewarded $1000 for delivering the drunk passenger to the Altruist camp.


Drive over to the gate of Altruist camp, which will make the gates open for you to enter and hand over the drunk driver. An armed man will then force the drunk driver to go with him, and give you your reward.
Repeat for the other drunk driver random event for another easy $1000.

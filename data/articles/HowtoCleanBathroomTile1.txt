 Mixing water and distilled white (or cleaning) vinegar in equal amounts produces an effective cleaning agent. For instance, you might mix five tablespoons of vinegar with five tablespoons of water. Dab a rag in the mixture and scrub the tile until clean. Wipe dry, or allow to air dry., Lemon juice is slightly acidic, and therefore effective as a tile-cleaning agent. Fill a spray bottle with lemon juice and spray the juice onto the tile directly, then wipe it away with a damp sponge.Alternately, dampen a sponge with some lemon juice directly, then use it to wipe the tile down. Rinse the tile off with a sponge or cloth dipped in warm water.
If you wish, you could sprinkle your bathroom tile with a thin coat of baking soda before spraying it with lemon juice or wiping it down with a lemon juice-soaked sponge.

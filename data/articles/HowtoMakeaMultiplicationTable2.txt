 Resize the second and the fourth columns, and repeatedly put “x” for multiplication and “=” in these cells. This is to specify the operation to be used.
 Go to the first table and fill in the number 1 in each cell of the first column.


Then go to the second table and fill in the number 2 in each cell of the first column. Fill in the number 3 in the third column, and so forth.






Go back to the first table, and fill in the numbers 1 through 10 in the third column. Do the same for the third column of each of the tables.
 In the last column (fifth cell) of the first table, write the formula, “=(cell number of the multiplicand)*(cell number of the multiplier)”.


For emphasis, go to the first row of the first table. You will see “1” in the 1st cell, and “1” again in the second cell. To produce the answer in the fifth cell, you need to type, =, then click the 1st cell, then type, *, the click the 2nd cell, and press Enter.
This function will allow you to multiply the numbers in the respective cells.
 Just press copy (ctrl + c) or right click, “copy”, highlight all the cells you want to have that formula, then press paste (ctrl + v) or right click, “paste”.

 Find a container large enough to stick your hands in. Fill the container about half way full with acetone.Acetone is the main component in most nail polish removers. It can be found at most general and drug stores.
Do not fill the container completely full.
If you have sensitive skin, consider diluting the acetone with water.;
, Completely submerge the super glued skin in the acetone. Let it soak for at least two to three minutes.
 Gently rub the skin to break the glueâ€™s bond. Once the bond is broken, remove your hands from the acetone. Carefully peel the glue from your skin.








Avoid leaving your hands in the acetone for longer than ten minutes. Acetone can irritate your skin.
If you feel resistance when removing the glue, stop and let your hands soak longer.
Do not force the glue from your skin. This is dangerous and can cause damage.
 Thoroughly wash your hands with warm water and soap. This will help to wash away any residual glue or acetone. Pat your hands dry. Acetone can dry out your skin so it is wise to apply a moisturizer after washing your hands.

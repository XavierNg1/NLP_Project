Natalie Portman lives in Paris, France with her husband and child. She is immensely inspired by the Parisians’ instinctual and natural style. She has observed that many French women forego brushing their hair completely every morning. This easy, natural do falls perfectly in line with her desire to present the most natural version of herself.

Natalie has notoriously curly hair. To tame her locks and create this “slept in” do, she either washes and blow-dries her hair before bed or sleeps on it wet.,

Natalie Portman’s hair is often styled very simply. Some of her go to dos include:

Hair down with loose, romantic curls.Hair down with slight waves and lots of volume.Hair parted, slicked back, and pulled into a bun, chignon, or ponytail.,

When walking the red carpet, Natalie often opts for an intricate up-do or a vintage inspired hairstyle.

Like Natalie, you can transform your typical up-dos into intricately delicate masterpieces by incorporating braids, twists, and curls into your dos.Natalie is also a fan of retro, 40’s inspired hairdos. To steal her elegant look, set your hair in loose finger curls.

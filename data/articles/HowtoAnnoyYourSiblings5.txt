 If you're by yourself with your sibling, lie on the ground and scream. When your mom or dad comes, say that he/she pushed you. Your parents will punish them.
 If your sibling is doing something that they don't want your parents to know about, tell on them. They'll really dislike that. Make sure that you have proof of them doing whatever they're doing by videotaping, audio recording, or photographing it. It's sweet, sweet revenge.

 A layered haircut adds more shape to your haircut, and reduces weight that can drag your hair into a flat style. Flip through a book of layered cuts at a salon to find a style you enjoy.


This works best on thick hair.
Even a front or side fringe can make it easier to add volume. Just blow dry the fringe while wrapping it onto a round brush.
 Put your wet hair into rollers, or section into ponytails and wrap each one into a bun against your head. Leave them there for 3-6 hours or overnight. The resulting waves or curls add a great deal of volume compared to straight hair.


For maximum volume, create large barrel curls, then loosen them with your fingers to create the desired shape.
 If you have relaxed, Afro-textured hair, try switching to a "texlax" style. This just means using your relaxer product for a shorter amount of time, or diluting it before use. The result is a semi-relaxed hairstyle that is looser than your natural hair, but still has plenty of texture and volume.
 If you have thin, flat hair, extensions may be the easiest way to add volume and length. Clip-in hair extensions are easy to try out, so there's no need to make a big commitment.

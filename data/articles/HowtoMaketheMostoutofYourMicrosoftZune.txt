 Create photo files that consist of simply a blank, white image, or say a red or blue one. Use the white image in dark locations as a flashlight. You can use red much in the same way, but red doesn't ruin your night vision, nor is it as disturbing. Using bright colors can also be beneficial when signaling someone in a big crowd. Regardless, it's a cheap low-tech method that can be used in many cases.;
, There are quite a few files of text pictures around Zune forums that allow you to send messages to friends using the built in WiFi file sharing capability. Since you can't yet utilize the WiFi for anything but file sharing, it could be nice to send a friend something real quick, like: "How was that song?" or "Are you coming." Hey, its free. If you would prefer not to make your own text pictures, there are free alternatives, such as Zune.Chat.Live.Googlepages.Com, or "ChikaZune".
 While there is no podcast folder, utilize the 'Right Click' 'Find Album Info' function on a podcast album. Microsoft Meta Services has a lot of popular podcast information. If you can't find your podcast- edit the album info with a logo, etc. that you save on your hard drive. Keep all podcasts in a playlist to separate them from your normal tunes.

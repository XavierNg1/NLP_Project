 If you are finding your new schedule is ever-changing, and nothing is familiar, then you may be adjusting your life around your new partner. Look for a few of the following tell-tale signs:


You haven’t talked to your best friend in a long time. If you don’t know what your best friend is up to, what their latest news is, you’re definitely placing the new partner first.
Normal hobbies are being put on the back burner. Did you miss poker night or ladies night? Ask yourself if your time with friends has been sacrificed.
If you’ve skipped a family meal or get together for a new flame, chances are you’re altering your daily life for them. , If you have been really moody lately, or have been easily upset, it’s understandable after a breakup. If this has affected your daily life, however, enough that everyone is noticing, then you’ve likely changed emotionally. Create some alone-time in your schedule. Find time to just relax and steady your nerves. If you can't change your attitude and be happy about your new partner, that's not a good relationship sign.
Repeat positive affirmations daily. Each day you tell yourself why you are happy with your partner. If convincing yourself proves difficult, the relationship may just be a rebound.
 No matter what sappy romance movies tell you about the great love that’s been sitting under your nose the entire time, jumping straight out of a breakup into a relationship with a very good friend is a likely sign of a rebound relationship. Immediately reaching out to date your best friend is not the best solution, it's just the easiest.


You run the additional risk of ruining the friendship if the relationship doesn't work out.
Dating a good friend allows the uncomfortable stage of a relationship to be skipped.
Romance and intimacy happens more quickly when the friendship is already established.

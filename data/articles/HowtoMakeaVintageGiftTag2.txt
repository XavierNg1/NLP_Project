 For a large, substantial tag, cut out your image to create a 5 x 7 inch/12.5 x 17.5cm card. Although this will be the tag's main image, you will be laying cardstock over it that will contain the recipient's name.
 Use distressing ink to create a vintage look. If the photo, sheet music or image already has a distressed appeal, you can skip this step.

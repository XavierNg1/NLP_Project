 The good news is that the Dvorak format is already configured into your operating system, so you don't have to download anything special to access it. Although QWERTY is the automatic setting, all you need to do is to change between the layouts. , To change to the Dvorak format on Windows XP, follow these steps: Click the "start" button> Control Panel> Regional and Language Options> "Languages" tab> "Details" button >"Add" button (under "Settings" tab)> in "Keyboard layout/IME" scroll to United States-Dvorak and click "OK".
 To change to the Dvorak format on your Mac, follow these steps: Click on the Apple Menu> System Preferences> International> Input Menu Tab> scroll to Dvorak For Mac OS X: Apple Menu> System Preferences> Click on the keyboard icon>Input Sources>Click box next to "Dvorak", Once you switch to the Dvorak layout, practice switching back to QWERTY by following the same steps as above, but selecting QWERTY instead of Dvorak. As you start learning Dvorak, you may want the option of switching back to QWERTY if you need to complete a project quickly. Learning how to switch in between the two, at least while you are learning Dvorak, is a good idea.

, The water needs to be between 110–120 °F (43–49 °C). Allow it stand for approximately ten minutes.
,,, If the dough feels very sticky, then dip your hands into some flour so that the dough will not stick as you roll it.
 It might be easier to cut the butter into small pieces. Also the butter should be soft and at room temperature. The butter will also help to grease the rice cooker bowl, so that the bread will not stick to the sides. Knead the butter into the ball until the butter is completely absorbed into the dough and has no lumps.
 This is the first dough rise.
 This is because the yeast in there is eating up the starch and sugars in the flour and breathing out carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide dissolves into the dough, and either escapes, or expands the air bubbles in the dough that were there from mixing causes dough to get bigger!








, Do this a few times, until the dough returns to its original size. Once again allow it to sit in a warm area. This is now the second and final rise.
 Just leave it alone for one hour, and it will puff back up to double its size. Yeast works this way.
 Make sure it does not burn on the bottom. Temperatures differ with each rice cooker, so you will have to learn what is best for you. Write down the times and steps, so you will remember it for the next bake.
 This is the second baking period. It is also supposed to be 1 hour, but may not need that long. The cooker you use probably makes all the difference here.

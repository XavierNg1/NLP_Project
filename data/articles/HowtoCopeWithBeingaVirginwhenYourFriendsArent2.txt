 Whatever your values are regarding sexual activity, be true to those values. If you have made a decision to stay abstinent until marriage, stick to that. Or, if you’ve just decided you want to wait until the time is right, then you should hold true to that.


Don’t let your friends be the reason you let go of something you have always believed in.
 Even if you aren’t a virgin by choice, don’t have sex just to “get it over with” or to catch up with your friends. You should still wait until you meet the right person, and do it only when it feels comfortable, right, and safe.You don’t want to have sex just to catch up with your friends and end up regretting it, or feeling emotionally negative about what you did. Your virginity is important, and so are you.
 No matter what anyone says, losing your virginity is completely up to you. Remember that consent can be given and taken away at any point, and that your partners need to respect your choices.


Also remember that all sex acts, even oral sex or kissing, require consent. Don’t ever let anyone pressure you into any sexual activity you aren’t willing to engage in, or that you don’t want to do., If hearing about their sexual experiences makes you uncomfortable, change the subject when it comes up. Ask them politely not to talk about it while you’re around. Don’t be afraid to let your friends know that you aren’t really interested in talking about it.


Find other things to talk about with your friends. You can redirect the conversation anywhere else, without even letting them know you are avoiding the topic of sex.
 If any of your friends are teasing you about being a virgin, talk to them about how their teasing is affecting you. Ask them to stop teasing you.

Try saying something like, “I would really appreciate it if you stopped teasing me about being a virgin. It really hurts my feelings, and makes me feel like you don’t value me as a friend.”

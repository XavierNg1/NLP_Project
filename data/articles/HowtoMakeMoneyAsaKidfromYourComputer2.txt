 Everyone is good at something, from playing guitar to giving relationship advice to executing practical jokes. Whatever your talent may be, there are likely people willing to pay — or at least click on ads — to enjoy watching it.To drive traffic to your content, you’ll probably either have to provide something unique, or something common done exceptionally well.
If you establish a Partner account on YouTube, for instance, you can earn some money for the advertising displayed with your uploads. This will require an adult’s permission and account, however.
 If you want to blow the mind of an adult who hasn’t kept up with computer games since the days of the Oregon Trail on an Apple II-e, tell them some young people make thousands of dollars per month just by letting others watch them play.You can earn money with gameplay streaming on sites like YouTube or Twitch (Amazon), for example. To build a following, however, you need to not only be good at the game, but also adept at sharing insights and interacting with your fans.

Once again, sponsors and especially advertising are the key ways to raise funds from blogs or podcasts. Programs like Google AdSense (https://www.google.com/adsense/start/), for instance, will utilize space on your webpage for targeted advertising and send a bit of money your way., The internet allows anyone to bypass book publishers and record companies, and the only real barrier to making some money is the quality of what you produce.You can sell songs of your own creation on iTunes, and self-publish stories or books at the Amazon Kindle store, to mention two popular avenues.
While it’s more likely you’ll never make a penny than it is you’ll achieve fame and fortune, at the very least you’ll have a good creative outlet for your talents.

 Because intramuscular injections are more painful than a SQ injection, efforts must be made to reduce the pain that a cow will feel when the needle is put in. To lessen the pain then, most veterinarians firmly thump the heel of their hand against the cow’s neck two or three times prior to introducing the needle. It's highly recommended you follow this procedure.Thumping the cow’s neck with your hand desensitizes the nerves so when the needle is put in, she is less likely to feel the needle going in and become startled.
 Hold the syringe in your dominant hand (right, if right-handed). Identify the injection triangle and selecting an area near the center, be ready to put needle in at a perpendicular angle to the surface of the skin. , Keeping the needle perpendicular to the skin surface and a using firm, thrusting movement, push the needle through the skin into the muscle. This must be done immediately after the neck has been thumped a few times. At this point the cow may flinch so be ready for her to move around a little in the chute (a bit more if she's not used to human contact).


Check to see if you have hit a vein or artery. To do this, withdraw the plunger of the syringe a small amount and look for blood back-flow. If you find blood going into the syringe, you’ve hit a blood vessel. You will have to withdraw and try a different site.
 Once you have checked that you have not hit a blood vessel, you can administer the medication. Slowly depress the plunger until the cow has received the correct dose. If you are giving more than 10 mL IM, be sure to give no more than 10 mL per injection site.


After you have removed the syringe, press the spot with your fingers for a few moments to keep the spot from bleeding.

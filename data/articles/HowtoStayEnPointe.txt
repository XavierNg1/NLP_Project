 When going up en pointe, try not to suddenly rise, unless of course you are doing a relev√©. This will make you go off balance when you get en pointe. Instead, go up slowly until you are nearly at demi pointe and then you can snatch until on full pointe.;
, When you do get up en pointe, it is difficult to stay up there. Bend your foot over and stab into the ground. This plants your feet into the floor and gives you a sturdy support below.
 Most people think that turnout comes from the ankles, but it does not; it comes from the hips. If you push your hips and thighs out and push your heels forwards then it is a lot easier to stay up and makes the position look a lot more attractive and professional.
 The most important thing when en pointe is to engage your centre and your buttocks. This may sound silly, but it works. Clench your butt cheeks and use your abdominal muscles to provide strength to your legs and lower back.
 It is a lot harder to balance if you are looking at the floor, so lift your head, and look out front instead. Pretend that you are on a stage and everyone is looking at how fantastic you look. It helps you pull out, takes strain of your feet, and improves your posture.
 Straighten your legs and lock them out. Obviously it is more difficult to balance on relaxed knees.
 After all the technical work, smiling always helps. Everyone knows that.

 Have about four people come to help at the bazaar. Two to handle money and two to sell the refreshments if there will be any.


Make sure that they and you know the prices and conditions of every single piece. Someone may ask you a question and if you don't know the answer, they probably won't buy the item! Be honest if you don't know, but try to make sure that you do just in case.
 Once it gets time to end the day, be sure you count the money and have a list of everything that was sold and for how much. If you are paying the people who helped, be sure to give them a fair amount and don't over or underpay them.


If you have items left over, you can donate them to the local Salvation Army or Goodwill.
 Well, not until after you've cleaned up!

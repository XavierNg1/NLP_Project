 The Daily Spin is a virtual slot machine that rewards with coins for the game. You are given free turns at it at regular time intervals.


From the header menu, look for the Daily Spin menu identified by the name and a picture of a slot machine window; click on this. The Daily Spin window will appear.
 If you have a free spin available, click on the “Free Spin” button that appears. The slot machine will spin. Your updated Coin Balance will be reflected right below it.


The time for the next Free spin will be shown. Come back when the time comes to take another spin at it.
 If you don’t want to wait and want to do some more spins at the virtual slot machine, you can buy Spins.


From the Daily Spin window, after taking your free spin, click the “Shop Spin Deals” button. You will be taken to the Shop window, with the Daily Spins tab open. Select the spin deal or package you want to buy, and then click the “Buy” button below.
 A Facebook window will appear; Facebook is the one that processes your payments. A list of payment options will be displayed, ranging from credit card, to PayPal, to online banking.


Select your payment option and click the “Buy” button. A confirmation message will be displayed by Bejeweled Blitz after your transaction.
 Go back to the Daily Spin window and use the spins you’ve just bought to increase your Coin Balance.

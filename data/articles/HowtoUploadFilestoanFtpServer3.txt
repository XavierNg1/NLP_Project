 Although Windows and OS X have FTP functionality built-in, the tools are rather limited. If you're going to be uploading a lot of files and need features like queuing and upload resuming, you'll want to use an FTP client to connect to the server., There are tons of FTP clients out there, some of which are free and some that cost money. One of the most popular free clients is FileZilla, which is an open-source FTP client available at filezilla-project.org and can be installed on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
 When you start your FTP client, you'll need to create a new connection profile. This will save your connection information, allowing you to quickly reconnect in the future.


Enter the FTP address, your user name, and your password (if required). Most FTP servers run on port 21, so you won't have to change this value unless specified by the server.
 Once you've entered in all of your information, you can connect to the FTP server. You'll see the connection log in the status section of the client as your computer contacts and connects to the server.
 Many FTP servers restrict uploads from users to specific folders. Refer to your FTP server's documentation to see what folder you have permission to upload to. Use the right panel to navigate through the FTP's folders.
 The left panel in the FTP client shows your local computer's directories. Navigate through the folders to find the files you want to upload.
 Either double-click a file to begin uploading it, or drag it from the left panel to the right panel.
 The upload progress will be displayed in the bottom panel of the FTP window. Wait until your upload has completed before disconnecting from the FTP server.

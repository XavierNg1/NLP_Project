 If you catch the stain as soon as the caulk gets onto the material, you might be able to wipe most of it off with a clean, damp rag.


Gently rub at the stain. As you rub, use a slight upward motion to encourage the caulk to come off the material instead of rubbing it further into the fibers.
You could attempt to simply dab at the stain, but this may not be enough force depending on how much the caulk has already begun to set.
Use warm water instead of cold water since warmth encourages the caulk to stay soft.
 If the caulk got on your clothes or some other removable item of fabric, place the stained item in the freezer for 30 to 60 minutes or until well frozen.


You do not, of course, need to do this step or any of the following steps if the caulk came off simply by scrubbing it.
When ready, the fabric should be very stiff and the caulk should be hard to the touch.
 The solidified caulk should be easier to remove. You can scrape at it with a painter's chisel until the strip of caulk begins to peel up, then peel the rest away with your fingers.


It is not recommended for you to chisel or scrape away the entire caulk stain. Doing so could cause the fibers in the material to tear more than necessary.


Before using the acetone, test it on a small part of the material hidden along the underside. Acetone can fade and ruin certain fabrics, so testing it is necessary if you do not want to risk further damage.
Apply the cleaner to the fabric using a cotton swab or cotton ball. Let it sit for five minutes or as directed on the label before rinsing out with warm water.
Launder the cloth as usual when done.

 From any of the phone numbers you’ve registered with your Google Voice account, dial your Google Voice number.
 When prompted, press 2 on your keypad to make a call.
 A voice prompt will tell you to enter the phone number you’d wish to call. Enter it in using your phone’s dial pad, and press the pound (#) key afterwards. Be sure to enter the phone number with the proper prefix and country code.
 Google Voice will connect you to the phone number you’ve entered. Wait for the recipient to answer.

 Make sure everything's perfect, like the time you'll be leaving and the time you'll be coming back, just so you know when you'll be back with your beloved children!
, They deserve to know where their parent is - you're supposed to be their role model, after all, so don't hold this back from them.  It might be rough if your kids always need you by their sides, but try to tell them your reasons and soon enough, they'll be convinced., Leaving them alone is not a very good choice, especially if your kids are young and they won't be able to manage their lives or the house on their own. A trustworthy family member or a close friend should do the job for you - a babysitter might be too expensive for such a long trip. Just make sure the kids like this person, or both your kids and their company's lives could be unpleasant while you're away., Before you take off, make sure there's everything your kids might need in the house, and let them know how to use the washing machine and how to prepare a good meal for themselves, because take-outs aren't the best choice out there. If you need to work out a ride to school, decide whether a short walk or use of the bus will be the best option, based on your location., If, despite your preparations, you still find yourself worrying about the kids, look at possible activities to fill your day and switch your mind to a different topic. Spending the entire vacation in anxiety over your children won't make the trip worth it., There's no need to ignore your family's existence. Try scheduling a time each day to make a call, email, write letters, or otherwise contact the children. You can even text throughout the day if you'd like.

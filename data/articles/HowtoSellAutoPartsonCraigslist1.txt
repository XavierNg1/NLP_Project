 This process may help you generate a feasible amount of money from your sales, in addition to educating you on how much the same parts are being sold for by other businesses.


Call auto part stores or junkyards in your local area. Since Craigslist primarily deals with buyers in your local area, you may want to price your auto parts similar to what local businesses are selling the parts for.
Perform pricing research on the Internet. Browse Craigslist for auto parts similar to yours or visit auction websites such as eBay to see how much others are selling the auto part for.
You can also perform a basic Internet search for the name of your auto part, such as "1969 Ford Mustang Convertible Top" to see the search results or price listings that appear for that auto part.;
, This will allow potential buyers to see the condition of the auto parts you are selling.


Clean your auto parts before taking pictures of them, if possible. Clean, shiny auto parts may look more attractive to potential buyers.
Take photographs that display the auto part from every angle; such as the front, back, and side.
Craigslist will allow you to upload up to 4 photographs; however, if you want to display more than 4 photographs, you can use external photo hosting websites or embed HTML code into your posts that link to your photos displayed on other websites.
 Your Craigslist posts should include relevant details about the auto parts that buyers will need to help locate the correct parts needed.


Gather the make, model, and year of the auto part.
Note any extra features of the auto part. For example, if you are selling a car door that originally had manual door locks, but you replaced them with automatic door locks, include this information in your Craigslist post.
Note any existing damages on the auto part. For example, if you are selling a rear bumper, examine it for any major dents or scratches that you can mention in your post.

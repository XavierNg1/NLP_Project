 The most likely dental emergency for denture wearers is a chipped denture tooth or one that has broken off. If you have a spare denture (all denture wearers should have one), use it until you can go to the dentist and have it fixed.
 If your whole denture breaks in half, use your spare and visit your dentist immediately. Some people may attempt to use cyanoacrylate to repair it, but it is very unpredictable, and generally not strong enough to hold the denture together.

 How messy is it? How long will it take to clean? When you have established how long it will take to clean, decide on a morning/afternoon/day when it has to be done. When that time has arrived, tell your child that you are taking away all their personal electronics and accessibility to electronic devices until their room is clean.


Do not give in, even if they need electronics for school etc. Remind them that they can have it back as soon as they clean their bedrooms and maybe they should keep it clean and they would have their electronic devices.
 This only stresses and angers older children and does not necessarily motivate them. It may be hours, days, weeks or even months before they give in to temptation. Don't worry, eventually they will give in (try living for a day with out electronics and see how you feel!).
 and started cleaning their room, that you have them keep their bedroom door open. That way you can check on their progress every 10-30 minutes and remind them what they haven't done yet.
 When their room is 100 percent clean, (check everywhere), hand them all their personal electronics and grant them permission to all other family electronic devices (TV, family computer, family iPad etc.) Done!

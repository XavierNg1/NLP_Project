Have all paperwork signed by parents. Put away all of your books, papers and other school requirements, inside your bag and ready to take in the morning.;
, Lay it out somewhere that you can remember to find it in the morning.


Include accessories if you want to wear these.
 Wake up at least thirty minutes or earlier before school starts, so that you have plenty of time to get ready. It's also helpful to use an alarm clock or radio to wake up.
 This is a good start for keeping nice and clean during the school day.


If you want, take a shower. It will make you smell and feel better throughout the whole day.
 You'll be glad that you laid out your clothes the night before.
 Style it any way you like or just leave it as it is.
, Make sure you like what you have for breakfast. And always remember, any breakfast is better than none.So eat up!


If you don't have enough time to eat breakfast and home, then just pack a breakfast bar into your bag or put it in your pocket so you can quickly and easily get it out and then you can eat your healthy breakfast bar on the way to school or at break time, if you have that at your school.
 For example:


Move your siblings! Help them get up in the morning. They might be the reason that you're late.
Give food and water to your pets, if applicable.
 Turn off all lights and lock the doors if you're responsible for doing this. Head out the door and be on time!

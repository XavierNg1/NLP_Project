 Take some time in a quiet place simply to think about your feelings toward the person in question, and your interactions with them. Some questions to consider are:


How long have you known this person?
How frequently do you see or talk to them?
Is the communication equitable?
What is the level of intimacy shared (either physically or conversationally)?
How would you characterize your time together? Do you both seem to enjoy being together?

, If you’re trying to determine whether someone is a friend or a crush, make a “Friend/Crush” list. If you’re figuring out whether someone is in love with you, make a “Like/Love” list. Like a Pro/Con list, record any specific behavior that would indicate how they feel about you. Having a visual aid way may give you more insight into how they feel.
 Sometimes our feelings toward someone can cloud our judgment in assessing their behavior. A friend can offer an honest, objective observation of the relationship, and will be less likely to allow personal feelings to affect their understanding.

CR-1: marriage between immigrant, and USC spouse less than two years must file this. It is a Conditional Residence green card that must be removed in two years.
IR-1: Immediate Relative, marriage between immigrant & USC spouse for more than two years must file this. It has no limit.

;
, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will send you a Notice of Action (NOA) or two for your I-130 or I-129F. This simply indicates that your petition is in process.
 You may have to wait for these letters to arrive anywhere from 1-2 months before the scheduled interview date.
The completed case will be forwarded from the USCIS to the National Visa Center to be processed where you will receive the exact forms to refill out for the process except you will receive a Visa application. After mailing, you will have to wait for an appointment 8-12 months at the foreign consulate.
 Fiancé  intending immigrants can wait until they enter the U.S. and file for adjustment of status. After the exam, the intending immigrant will be given the results from the exam which need to be taken (still sealed) to the interview, usually the next business day.
In Ciudad Juarez (CDJ), where all Mexican applicants have their interviews, there are only two approved clinics that administer the exams.
In the United States, Mexican applicants will be mailed a list of approved doctors for the medical exam by USCIS.
 The same for the Adjustment of Status applicant, USCIS will determine whether the immigrant is eligible for the AOS.

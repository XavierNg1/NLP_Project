 You should know what types of cables are needed, such as coaxial, S-video and RCA patch-cords. You should also know how they will be stacked, arranged or otherwise situated when you are finished. This foreknowledge will prevent a frustrating do-over.;
, On the back of the cable-box/vcr there will be two coaxial hookups labeled "cable in" and "tv out," or something similar.


The "cable in" (cable box) gets hooked to the cable jack from the wall or floor. Connect the "tv out" (cable box) cable to the "in" on the VCR. Connect the "out" (vcr) to the coaxial connection on the TV.
 You could also connect an S-video cable (small, round ends with little pins and a piece of long, thin plastic inside).


These cables should have come with the DVD player. If not, you can buy them at any store that sells electronics, such as Radioshack.
 Use the appropriate cables and make sure that you are going "out" of the DVD player and "in" on the TV. These should be labeled as well.
 Make sure that your TV is on the proper channel for the cable-box and VCR (usually channel 3, but sometimes 2 or 4). The VCR should be on the same channel (for recording purposes.) When the VCR is off, you are watching cable. When the VCR is on, you are watching a tape.


The DVD player will be found on an alternate "input" setting such as "video1" or "svideo," depending on the input and type of TV.
 Power them up.

 Look to integrate indoor walking into your everyday routine. For instance, walk around the inner perimeter of the grocery store before doing your shopping. Take the stairs instead of the elevator (unless you have more than three or four flights to climb). This extra bit of exercise each day adds up.You could also behave inefficiently in order to purposely increase opportunities for walking. For instance, instead of taking all your laundry out of the machine at once, take just one shirt out, then walk to your dresser and put it away. Return to your washing machine and repeat until the laundry is completely put away.
 Use your lunch hour to get some walking time in. If you work in or near a large office building or mall, it’s easy to find time to walk during your break. Walking when you’re on a work break is not only great exercise, but it can help you relax and return to work feeling refreshed. Plus, walking will help you digest your lunch better., Like any exercise routine, make time to walk for exercise each day. Put it in your schedule. This will ensure that you don’t just go walking a few times and then never do it again. Even if you only have 10 – 15 minutes each day to walk, write it in your planner or make a reminder alarm in your phone.Be realistic when scheduling your walking time. Don’t schedule more time than you can actually spend.
 The great thing about walking indoors is that you never have to worry about the sun going down or the weather changing suddenly. There is no bad time to walk indoors for exercise. Identify a time (or a few times) you can walk indoors each day and put it in your schedule. You could choose to walk:In the morning, before work or school
In the late morning or early afternoon, when you break for lunch
In the evening, when you’re home from work and looking for a good way to unwind

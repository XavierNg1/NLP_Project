, Typically, GPS units have two parts, the electronics component and the antennae respectively. the electronic component is usually in a plastic case with a magnet on the bottom, and connected by a wire to its antennae. Generally, the electronics unit is much larger than the antennae. Because the antennae receiver must be able to locate, transmit and receive signals from satellites, its placement is critical as it must have no metallic obstructions between it and the sky. Passive GPS devices are single units, often small enough to fit in the palm of a hand.
 The antennae can be attached to the metal frame underneath the plastic bumper cover by using a real time GPS system. A passive, single car DVD Nav can easily be attached to the metal frame under the plastic bumper.
 For a real time GPS device, the electronics unit is place to a place where will not damaged by heat from the engine. And its antennae maybe attached to the radiator grille or underneath the plastic front bumper. A single passive GPS unit may be place anywhere in the engine compartment where the heat will not damage it.
 The wheelwell is very important place for the GPS unit is visible but don not rule it out. Check the outer edge of the wheelwell for the antennae. A single, passive GPS car navigation system may be attached in the wheelwell or to the undercarriage.

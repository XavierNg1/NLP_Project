 Your parents might have added you to their credit card to help you learn financial management or in case of emergencies. Ask ahead of time what you can use the credit card for—and don’t buy anything that hasn’t been approved.


Although you get your own card, all charges go to the primary cardholder’s account. They can see what you buy. And they are responsible for paying the bill on time., Fewer people carry cash on them. However, you shouldn’t use the credit card as a substitute for cash. You will very easily rack up charges, all the while thinking, “I’ll pay Mom back for this.” Before you know it, you’ve charged hundreds of dollars that you can’t repay.


Instead, use cash to pay for things like food, movies, and magazines.
 It’s unfair to go on a spending spree and then leave the primary cardholder to pay your debts. They may end up defaulting on the debt, which will hammer their credit score. Accordingly, you should do what you can to pay off your debt:



Get a part-time job. You have time in the evenings and on weekends to earn money to pay back the primary cardholder. Find a part-time job or pursue freelance work.
Sell possessions. Hold a garage sale or put items on eBay to sell. Then contribute the proceeds to the debt. The faster the debt is paid off, the better the cardholder’s credit.
 Call the credit card issuer and ask to be removed. Some may allow you to submit a request online. Provide the account information and answer a security question.You should tell the primary cardholder that you want to remove yourself. You may need their help.
You should check your credit report to see that you’ve been removed as an authorized user. If not, follow up with the credit card issuer.

 You can do this using a rolling pin or even a glass bottle. The sheet should be about Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters) thick. Avoid making it too thin, as it may break after it hardens. At the same time, avoid making it too thick, or it will take too long to dry.


You can buy air-dry clay from the craft store. Look for the kind that dries white; it will be gray while it is still wet, however.
 If you don't have a cookie cutter, you can cut it out using a knife. As a last result, you can always form a flat heart using your hands.


This can make a wonderful ornament. Consider poking a hole near the top of the heart with a skewer so that you can thread some ribbon through it later.
 Make sure that the "tiles" are flush with the surface of the clay. If they are sticking out too much, they may fall off.


If the clay starts to harden and crack while you are working with it, dip your finger in water and smooth the cracks down.
 As the clay dries, it will lighten in color. Depending on how humid or dry it is in your area, this may take 1 to 2 days., You can even use a glossy decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge.This will make the colors of the tiles more vibrant. It will also help seal them into the clay and prevent them from falling off.


If you poked a hole in your mosaic, you can thread some ribbon through it after the varnish dries, and then hang it up.

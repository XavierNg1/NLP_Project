 Your doctor will be able to help you put together a food regimen that is both nourishing and healthy. Your doctor can advise you on ways to avoid foods and products that contain high amounts of sugar. This will help you reduce your sugar cravings, and the desire to consume products that are high in sugar and most likely high in aspartame.
 Buy or check out books from your local library that will educate you on aspartame and its harmful effects. You can also buy cookbooks with recipes that will help you cut down on unhealthy foods and habits. Look into topics like “strategies for healthy eating” or “how to avoid unhealthy eating.” You can find books online, at your local bookstore, or at your local library.
 Medical journals, like American Society for Nutrition, provide access to actual case studies on aspartame. Read these articles and educate yourself on the effects of aspartame. Then you can decide for yourself if aspartame is something you want to avoid, as well as how to avoid it.

 Add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water to the bowl and cover the dish with microwave-safe plastic wrap.Instead of using a microwave-safe bowl, you could also use a microwave-safe glass casserole dish that already has a lid. Do not use plastic wrap if you are using a lid.
Avoid lids that create an air-proof seal. If the lid to your dish creates a tight seal, leave the lid slightly askew on the top of the container to allow the contents of the dish room to vent.;
, Cook the cauliflower on full power in the microwave until it becomes tender.


Once ready, the cauliflower should be tender enough to easily pierce with a fork.
If it is still tough after 5 minutes in the microwave, you can continue microwaving it up to 5 minutes longer, going at intervals of 1 to 2 minutes each.
 Before you mash the cauliflower, let it cool down for about 5 minutes, or until it feels cool enough to touch.Drain any excess water from the dish before proceeding. The cauliflower needs to be fairly dry.
 Add the chicken broth, sour cream, salt, and pepper. If the cauliflower is too large to fit into the food processor, cut it into chunks using a kitchen knife.


You could use a blender if you do not have a food processor. Note that the cauliflower will need “steam” room, though, so if you use a blender, cover the top of the blender with a heavy, clean kitchen towel.
 Blend the ingredients together until you get the texture you desire. Scrape the sides with a spatula, as needed, to ensure even blending.


For creamier mashed cauliflower, blend the ingredients together at a high speed for a few minutes.
For chunkier mashed cauliflower, pulse the ingredients together at a medium speed for only a minute or so.
 Mashed cauliflower is best enjoyed while still warm. Top with butter, additional pepper, or chives, as desired.

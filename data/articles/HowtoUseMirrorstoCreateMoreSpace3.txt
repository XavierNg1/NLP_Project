 Do not simply hang up your mirrors everywhere in your home. Always take into account what the mirror is reflecting before hanging it up. You want to use mirrors to maximize light sources and emphasize space.Mirrors should reflect a light source in order to brighten a room by creating more light. A mirror facing a blank wall will not do much to brighten your space. Instead, place a mirror across from a window or a well-lit area in your home.
You should also avoid placing mirrors in areas where they will reflect things like furniture and clutter. You do not want a mirror to make a room look more cluttered. Instead of having a mirror facing a somewhat messy desk, have it reflect a sleek mantel that only holds a few decorative items.
 One strategically placed mirror in the kitchen is enough to make the room more open. Too many mirrors can be overwhelming and even look tacky. Mirrors are not usually necessary in the kitchen, so more than one mirror may look odd to visitors.For example, if you opt for a horizontal mirror running down one wall, do not put a mirror on the opposite wall. The effect will be overwhelming.
 Ceiling mirrors are no longer in fashion. They were popular in the '70's, but many decorators find them tacky. Also, mirrors on the ceiling will not do much to create the illusion of space. Stick to hanging mirrors on the wall.Mirrors can be great in your bedroom if you want to create more space there, as well as more light. A full-length mirror near your closet can work great if it, say, reflects a window or a lamp.

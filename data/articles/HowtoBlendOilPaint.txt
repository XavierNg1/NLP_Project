 This sketch is the framework you’ll use to differentiate the areas where you’ll need to blend oil paint from the rest of the painting.;
,, The underpainting should be painted with a thinned out base color. Use turpentine or your preferred thinner to create the consistency of a watercolor. More pigment should be for use in the darker areas of the painting, and additional turpentine should mix into the base color when you are ready to paint the lightest values. The varying tones in the underpainting will be your guide when you’re ready to blend oil paint.
 Typically, 10 to 15 minutes is sufficient.
 You may either mix all of your various shades for the blend before you begin, or you may lighten the shade as you work. For novices, it is generally best to have all of the shades at your disposal until you are satisfied with the blend.
, Flat brushes tend to work best for blending. Round brushes are typically avoided.
 The parallel strokes should be perpendicular to the lighter shades.
 A clean brush should always be used when working with a new shade, even if the actual color is the same.

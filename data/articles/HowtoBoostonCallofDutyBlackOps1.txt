 For this method you will need four players, each with two controllers set up to play split-screen multiplayer on Xbox Live. These players aren't going to try to kill you or win the game, but will just occupy the eight spots in the game to allow for your boosting. Since this is cheating, you will need to pick people you trust who are amenable to the goals of the session.;
, Then create a similar party of four with your controllers and your third friend. This will create two teams of four to fill a game entirely with dummy accounts.
 This is one of the main multiplayer options.
 Backing out is when you join a game and then leave because it doesn't have the desired settings. In this case you want to keep trying until you get a game with demolition.
 Find their accounts on Xbox Live and select the option to invite their party to your game.
 This will let you boost different classes at the same time.
 Have one team plant bomb A, and then right after have the second team plant bomb B. Then defuse bomb A, and then bomb B. If you do it in this order time will never run out.
 If you let go of X, you won't pick up the bomb immediately after arming or defusing.
 Do not let your score exceed 9500. You won't get any XP if you do.

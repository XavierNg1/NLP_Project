 (optional). Season with salt and pepper. Place the potatoes on a baking tray or roasting dish (optional). (Some people prefer to put the potato directly onto the wire rack.)

Potatoes may also be baked at lower temperatures for longer times. This process tends to give the outside of the spud a crisper skin.350 degrees F (175 C) for approximately 1 and a 1/2 hours or 375 °F (191 °C) for approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes is a good guideline.

Cooking times will vary. Not all potatoes are uniform in size and mass, making these cooking times a guideline, not a rule. Perform the fork test to figure out if the potato has reached the doneness you want.
 Some classic combinations include:









Sour cream and chive
Butter and salt
Cheese

 The receiver should fit into one of your computer's USB ports. You can typically find USB ports, which are thin, rectangular slots, on the sides of laptops and on the front of desktops' CPU boxes.


Plugging in the receiver before turning on the mouse will allow your computer to install any drivers or software needed to use the mouse.;
, To do so, you'll typically flip the mouse over and remove a tray on the bottom, though some mice instead have their batteries in a compartment in the back of the mouse.


If you haven't used the mouse in several months, consider replacing the batteries even if they were new when you inserted them.
Some mice, such as the Apple Magic Mouse 2, require charging instead of new batteries.
 This typically involves manipulating a button on the bottom of the mouse, though you may need to look for the On/Off switch on the side of the mouse.


If you can't find the On/Off button, consult your mouse's manual.
 This button's location will vary based on your mouse's developer, but you'll usually be able to find this button either between the two mouse buttons or on the mouse's side.


Some mice come listed as "plug and play", meaning that you don't need to manually connect them or download any software.
 Once you see the cursor begin to move on-screen, your mouse is connected.


If your mouse doesn't start moving, try turning it off and then back on. If applicable, you may also want to change the USB port into which the receiver is plugged.

 This shampoo recipe can be made with any type of soap flakes. Castile soap flakes are commonly used in shampoo, but you can also make shampoo using flakes you create from a regular bar of soap. Just make sure the soap is made with natural ingredients that you'd want to use in your hair. You will need:


Soap flakes
Boiling water
Almond oil
Essential oils;
, If you didn't buy pre-flaked soap, use a cheese grater or a knife to cut off small flakes that will dissolve in hot water. You need about 4 ounces of flakes to make a quart of shampoo. Place the flakes in a large bowl.
 Pour a quart of water into a small saucepan and bring it to a boil on the stove. Alternatively, heat a quart of water to boiling in the microwave.
 The boiling water will immediately dissolve the small soap flakes. Use a spoon to stir the mixture to make sure the flakes dissolve completely.
 Pour in 1/4 cup almond oil and 8 drops of your favorite essential oil, like lemon balm or peppermint. Stir the mixture well and allow it to cool.
 Use a funnel or simply carefully pour the shampoo into an old shampoo bottle to store it for later use.

 Some guitarists tune their E string down to D so that they can play power chords. This is seen by many as cheating, but deliberately 'mistuning' strings (scordatura) for any reason is a centuries old method used for any stringed instrument and has been used by Van Halen, Led Zeppelin, and many other bands that were known for their guitar work.









Since the D is now a full half-step lower, you can play simple 2-finger power chords with ease-- just hold the 6th and 5th string on the same fret.
This "drop D" tuning also allows for a deeper, darker sound, which many metal and alternative guitarists now prefer.
 For drop-C tuning, not only do you tune the lowest string way down to C, but all other strings down one note also. Metalcore bands such as Atreyu, Killswitch Engage, As I Lay Dying, Fall of Troy, and others use this tuning as it is deep and heavy. The final outcome (from thickest to thinnest) is:

A similar metal tuning, known as "Dethklok," is C F Bb Eb G C which is simply two whole steps (4 frets) down from standard tuning. The intervals are the same, so your playing never has to change, but everything is much, much deeper.
 Your whole band will be out of tune if you're not on the same page. The third fret on the top string, for example, is not a G if you're in Drop-D -- it is a half step lower -- a C#.

 Standing outside of the shower area, take a hair brush and go through your hair a few times. Gather any loose hairs in your hands and throw them away before stepping into the shower. This will minimize the number of hairs that may fall out and clog your drain., If you wash your dog or cat in the bath, then give them a good brush down elsewhere beforehand. Try to get off the matted areas and any clumps of loose hair before putting them under the water. In addition, if your dog is muddy, try to remove any larger chunks of dirt before bathing.To minimize the strain on your drain, when the weather is warm you might want to bathe your pets outside instead, if possible.
 As you run your hands through your wet hair, place the hair strands that end up on your hands on the wall or the shower ledge. This is better than letting them go on down the drain. When you step out of the shower or bath, wipe up these hairs with your hands or a paper towel and toss them in the trash.Make sure to gather up the hairs after every shower or bath or you could end up creating a hairball that could lodge in your drain.
 Debris, such as make-up pieces or clumps of dirt, can partially block the drain. When combined with hairs, this can then develop into a full clog. Be extra careful when putting on your make-up above the bathroom sink, for example. Placing extra screens on all drains can help to minimize these seemingly random clogs., Always let the water run for an extra minute or so after you step out of the shower or bath. This flushes any debris further down the pipes and helps to prevent a clog close to the drain. It is also a good idea to flush your bathroom sink with water as well since toothpaste and other products can clog the pipes otherwise.

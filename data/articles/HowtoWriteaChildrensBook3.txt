 Write down your ideas in a notebook. Some basics to bear in mind include:


Whether they’re geared toward children or adults, most great stories share a few basic elements: A main character, supporting characters, an interesting setting and a plot that includes a central conflict, trouble brewing, a climax, and a resolution.
For non-fiction or informational works: The book needs to inform the reader about history, people, events, real things or how-to instructions.
Picture books: These require a lot of illustration, usually in full color, which can make printing more expensive. Text is limited but needs to be both good and original––there is quite an art to limiting words and still putting across and excellent story.
 Many children’s books include a positive message, ranging from simple standards, like “share with others,” to more complex life lessons on topics like handling the death of a loved one or how to think about big issues like caring for the environment or respecting other cultures. It isn’t necessary to include a straightforward message, so don’t force it––if you do, your lesson may come off as heavy-handed, which won’t be appealing to kids.
 If writing fiction, this is your chance to write something silly, strange, nerdy, dreamy, fantastical. What inspired you as a child? Go there, explore those ideas. This doesn’t mean you should throw in something wacky for no good reason, though. Tap into feelings that are sincere and actions that make sense for your character. Readers can immediately pick up on writing that seems false, and that’s when they put down the book. And if writing non-fiction, this is your chance to share your knowledge and research with future generations of chefs, engineers and artists! Importantly, be creative but also accurate––it's a fine balance between keeping it light and still ensuring that the content is fact-checked thoroughly and understandable or doable by children.

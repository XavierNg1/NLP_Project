 You can use a small block of off-cut wood retrieved from the scrap pile, provided it's the right shape. A rectangle is the optimal shape because it's easy to hold and covers a good area when sanding. If needed, cut a piece of ordinary wood into a rectangle of a size suitable to hold in your hand (around 2" x 4").;
, Make firm fold line around the block to ensure that the sanding paper sits absolutely flat against the block. Wrap the sanding paper right around as if it were a present, causing the two edges to meet on one side.


Cut the sandpaper to size, as needed. You may not need to, it will depend on how large the sandpaper piece is to begin with.
 The clean, whole surface of the sandpaper is what you use to sand with on the item or surface. Sand away by holding onto the block firmly at the edges and applying pressure either on the whole flat part of the block or its edges (for tight corner work), as required. Replace the sandpaper when it has worn down and is no longer sanding.

 Act mysterious. Not stalker mysterious, but a little different.;
, Wear loose baggy jeans or pants a jacket and put your hair in a ponytail and find a red hat if possible.
 You should have 1-3 really close friends who are always with you when they get a chance.
 Always get familiar with it at home before trying it or you could blow the whole act!

, Hang back a little bit. If you're usually right up front, hang back a little and act aware.
 Try to be in the wrong place at the right time. Like if a ball is going to hit someone in the face, jump up and catch it before it hits them.
 Dani doesn't sleep the greatest because she is always fighting a monster, so look a little tired.
 if you find yourself doing that, stop and review who you really are.

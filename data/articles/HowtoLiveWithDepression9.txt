 When you live with depression, it’s important to know your own body and observe patterns in yourself. Keep track of these patterns by writing in a journal. This is beneficial for understanding how your environment has an effect on your mood, energy, health, sleep, etc. Writing in a journal can also help you understand how other people are affecting you.Journaling can also help you process your emotions and gain insight into why certain things make you feel the way you do.
Journaling is a simple activity that only takes a few minutes a day. If you require more structure, search online for tips on journaling, or find a book about the journaling process.
 Make writing in your journal a daily habit. Even if you spend only a few minutes writing, it can help you process your emotions and gain insight into why certain things make you feel the way you do.
 Make it easy for yourself to jot down notes. Keep a pen and paper with you at all times, or consider using a simple note-taking application on a phone or tablet computer that you often have with you.
 Journaling is about getting your feelings and thoughts down on paper. Don’t worry about spelling, grammar or style. This is the time to write whatever you want, rather than trying to craft the perfect message. Don’t worry about what other people might think.
 Use your journal however you want; you can keep everything private, share some things with friends and family or your therapist, or start a public tell-all blog. It is up to you and your comfort level how you use your journal.

 Waxing removes hair entirely and can be done at home with a kit purchased from a drugstore. You can either get spreadable wax and strips or ready-made strips that already have wax applied (which is the tidier option).


Waxing is only possible if the hairs are long enough for the wax to catch on. If you aren’t willing to let your hairs grow long enough to do this, either look for a short-hair wax (some claim to be able to wax as little as 2mm of growth, though their effectiveness varies) or use another option listed here (such as bleaching).
 The warmer your skin, the more open your pores – and the easier the hairs will be to remove.
 Most waxes must be warmed up, but wax strips are sometimes the exception. Read the instructions on your box for explicit details.
 Use the applicator that comes with the kit to spread it carefully, avoiding the delicate skin on your lips.
 Start on one side and smooth it firmly over the entire area, avoiding folds and air pockets.
, It will take the wax and your hair with it, but be forewarned that it will almost certainly hurt the first few times you try it. Don’t rip it off slowly or in several motions; this will make things worse.
 Make sure not to leave any residue.
 If your upper lip is still sore from the waxing, you may want to wait a while before doing this.

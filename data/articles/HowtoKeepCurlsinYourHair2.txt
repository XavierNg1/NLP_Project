 Instead of washing your hair the same day you want to curl it, try to wait a day or two before curling your hair. The natural oils in your hair will give it some texture and help the curls stay in place instead of slipping right out., If you have fine, straight hair, adding a product to create more texture will help your curls stay in place. Apply one of the following products to ensure your curls stay as long as possible:









Curl-enhancing cream. Make sure to use a formula designed for use on dry hair.
Dry shampoo. Just sprinkle it over your scalp and comb it through your hair to add dry texture.
Hair gel. Use just enough to add texture; don't use so much your hair feels weighed down.
 This extra step will add even more texture to your hair to keep your hair in a curled position. Apply it just before you start to curl your hair. Distribute it by combing it through from the roots to the tips.
 Use a curling iron or hot rollers to add curls to your prepped hair. The products you used to add texture to your hair should ensure that the curls stay in place. Try one of the following styles:









Spiral curls
Beachy waves
Big, soft curls

, If you're using a curling iron, it can help to pin your curls against your head as you form them. That way they'll cool in a coiled position and stay curly that much longer once you take them down. After creating a curl, coil it against your head and use a bobby pin to hold it in place. Take them down once your hair is cool.
 When your curls have cooled and you've taken them down, use your fingers to style your hair. Avoid using a comb or brush, since this could cause your curls to come undone.
 Use a medium or strong-hold hairspray to hold your style in place for the rest of the day.

 You will lose more weight some weeks than others. If you don't lose any weight one week, it does not mean you failed. Look at the overall process rather than a number on a scale. Do you feel healthier? Are you in better shape? Do your clothes feel looser? Stick to your plan and you will eventually achieve your desired results.
 If you and a friend are losing weight together, it'll be easier. As a plus, you can talk to them about your experience and eat out at healthy places together.
 The reward should not be pigging out at a diner or eating chocolate cake! Make it something like going shopping to get new clothes in your new, smaller size. That way, you are motivated to meet your goals.
 If you didn't meet or exceed your goal, that's okay! You are working towards it. Some people meet their goals faster than others and it's perfectly normal.

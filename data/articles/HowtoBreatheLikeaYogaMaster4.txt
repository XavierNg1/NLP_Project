 Instead of breathing in and out through your nostrils, this yogic practice involves breathing in through a "tube," made by rolling your tongue. If you cannot roll your tongue into a perfect tube, try to shape your tongue into as much of a cylinder as possible.Form a tube (or as much of a cylindrical shape as possible) with your tongue. Push the tip of your "tongue tube" out just past your lips.If you cannot roll your tongue on your own, you may need to use your hands to "shape" the tongue.
 Draw a slow, deep inhalation through your rolled-up tongue. Try to keep your lips tightly wrapped around your tongue to force all of the air through the "tube" you've formed with your tongue.As you inhale, tilt your head down and hold your chin against your chest.Feel the breath enter your lungs and hold the breath for approximately five seconds., Push the breath out of your nostrils in a slow, controlled exhalation. Try to exhale as you did during the Ujjayi pranayama. Focus on your chest and contract the vocal cords as the breath leaves your body through the nose.Do not practice the Shitali pranayama unless you are physically warm. Some yogis believe that the Shitali pranayama cools the body, which could be dangerous if you are cold or if you practice during the winter.

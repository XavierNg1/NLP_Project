 Your pet may experience some behavioral changes during their mourning process, such as pickier eating or barking or whining more. While it can sometimes be difficult, it is important to not reinforce these changes. Instead, help gently encourage your pet to return to their regular behavior.This may mean not switching out their food even if they are not eating as much, or simply not acknowledging or indulging in begging or other negative behavior.
If your pet is regularly making noise or whining, develop a command such as "quiet" to let your pet know when that behavior is inappropriate. Do not yell the command, but deliver it in a stern tone, and offer your pet positive reinforcement when they obey.
 It can be difficult to see an animal grieve, but just like with people they will need some time to process their emotions. Be patient with your animal if they do not seem to have as much joy or energy for a few weeks or even months. Stick to their routine, and allow them time to adjust.There is no set timeframe for how long a pet should grieve. If you are concerned that your pet is not improving, you may want to ask your vet for advice.
While your pet is grieving, provide it with plenty of love and support. Spend time grooming your pet, playing with them, and petting, cuddling, or simply sitting near them. Show them that you are there for them in their time of need.
 If your pet has become extremely lethargic, will not eat or drink, or exhibits overly aggressive or dangerous behaviors, consult your vet immediately. They may be able to recommend some practices to help your pet, from behavioral training to medication, if necessary.


Let your vet know that your animal has recently experienced a loss and how their behavior has changed since then.For example, if your animal has stopped eating all together, let your vet know, "My pet and I recently lost another pet in the family, and since then this pet has refused to eat any of their normal food."

 Before you speak to your current vet, spend some time thinking about your reasons for seeking a second opinion. Also, think about what you'd like to ultimately outcome to be.Here are some questions to consider:

What is the reason for the second opinion? Are you disputing a specific diagnosis? Do you think the current treatment plan isn't working? Do you need to see a specialist?
Do you intend to keep using your current vet, or are you hoping to switch?;
, If you hope to maintain your relationship with your current vet, your best course of action is to be direct. Make a list of your reasons for wanting a second opinion. Then call and ask to speak to your doctor. In many cases, you may need to leave a message for your vet to call you back. A good vet will support your decision, and will not be offended.You might say:

"I am calling because I am afraid Eddie's treatment plan isn't working. I was thinking of seeking another opinion on the matter."
"I'm afraid I may not be able to afford the treatments you have suggested. I may need to seek less expensive care, if I can find it."
"Eddie doesn't seem to be getting better. I think it might be time to consult a specialist."

, If you want to keep a relationship with your current vet, you can do so by keeping them informed. Put them in touch with your new vet, and contact them with any major changes to your pet's health and/or treatment plan. You may even consider scheduling a follow-up with your current vet, after your second opinion, in order to discuss all of your options.

 Build a Scud Storm to 0% by ordering a worker to build it and then moving him away before he reaches the site.
 Make sure there is at least one combat unit on the screen, so it can be in the same screen with the Scud.
 Select the Scud and press Q.
 Force fire where you want it to launch by clicking on control and clicking anywhere you have discovered in the map.
 Voila! It will keep hitting that place forever, about every 20 seconds. The only way to avoid re-hitting is to quickly sell it.

 You don't want to become infamous using your real name, so pick an appropriate pseudonym for yourself. And make sure to have an alternative or two! More than likely the name you pick will already be taken. Stay away from over-used names like Angel, Diamond or Rose. There are two ways to proceed when picking a name:


A name that sounds relatively normal. Pick something that fits your personality, like Grace, Summer or Hope.
A name that's slightly exotic. As a stripper, you are an exotic dancer. Why not pick something exotic? Gia, Amira or Ayesha would stand out.
 For some auditions you may need to just bring your outfit in a bag, go to the club, and say you want to dance. Hopefully they'll ask you for your ID to make sure you're at least 18. Others won't let you near a stage until they look you over either in your street clothes or in your outfit -- so both looks need to sell you!


If the manager wants you to "audition" anywhere other than the stage, get out of there! Places like this are either looking for "extras" girls or the manager is a pervert who tries to take advantage of the girls. Most clubs will put you on a satellite stage to audition. If you asked the right questions initially, you'll know how the procedure works.
 You've got your sexy lingerie on, your hair and makeup is perfect, and your nails are manicured to perfection. Now all you can do is feel the music, smile, and get your groove on. If they like you, great! When can you start? If they don't, don't take it personally. After all, who even knows your real name?


If you're really set on working at that establishment, ask them how you can improve and when you can audition again. They may have more general audition nights or amateur nights. If they're completely uninterested, just go down the block!

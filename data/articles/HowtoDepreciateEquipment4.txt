 This is also an accelerated depreciation method in which the bulk of the depreciation is recorded in the beginning of the assetâ€™s useful life. It is more correct than straight line depreciation if the asset becomes less useful as it ages.Understand the cash flow and tax implication of using accelerated depreciation. If a company books higher depreciation in the near term, then for that year its cash flow will be reduced. It also reduces the amount of taxable income, deferring tax payments into later years.
 Multiply the useful life by the useful life + 1. Divide this product by 2. Divide the number of years remaining in useful life by the SYD to get the depreciation rate for that year.Using the same example as before, suppose a company purchased a vehicle for $60,000 and the vehicle has a $10,000 salvage value and a five-year useful life. Use the equation 5(5+1) / 2 = 15.
Calculate the depreciation rate for year one by dividing the years remaining in useful life by the SYD. In year one, the years remaining in useful life is 5. Use the equation 5/15 = .3333. Apply this rate to the cost of the equipment less the salvage value to calculate the depreciation amount for year one. Use the equation ($60,000 -$10,000) x .3333 = $16,665. Record $16,500 in depreciation expense for year one.
Calculate the depreciation rate for year two. In year two, the remaining years in useful life is 4. Divide 4/15 = .2667. Apply this rate to calculate the depreciation. Depreciation is ($60,000 -$10,000) x .2667 = $13,335.
Calculate the depreciation rate for year three using the equation 3/15 = .2. Depreciation is ($60,000 - $10,000) x .2 = $10,000.
Calculate the depreciation rate for year four using the equation 2/15 = .1333. Depreciation is ($60,000 - $10,000) x .1333 = $6,665.
Calculate the depreciation rate for year five using the equation 1/15 = .0667. Depreciation is ($60,000 - $10,000) x .0667 = $3,335.
If you add up all of the depreciation rates for the five years, it comes to 100 percent (.333 + .2667 + .2 + .1333 + .0667 = 1).
If you add up the total depreciation expense for the five years, it will total the purchase price of the vehicle less the salvage value, which is $50,000 ($16,665 + $13,335 + $10,000 + $6,665 + $3,335 = $50,000).

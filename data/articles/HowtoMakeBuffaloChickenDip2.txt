 Most often, chefs will roast a chicken, let it cool, and then use their fingers to shred the chicken right off the bone, ignore the skin and simply pull the meat apart into small, bite-sized chunks., Simply heat some oil on medium heat, then pat your chicken breasts down with salt and pepper. Cook one side of the chicken until golden brown, then flip it and cover with 3/4 cup of water. Cover the pan and let it simmer for 7-10 minutes, or until fully cooked. Add water if it evaporates below the chicken while cooking. When done, let it cool slightly and shred into bite-sized pieces with your hands., In a real pinch, canned chicken will do just fine, though it won't have the freshness of a delicious, "real" chicken. When using canned chicken, be sure to drain the liquid out first, and consider cooking the chicken in the butter and hot sauce briefly to give it a bit more flavor before moving on.

 To make boric acid suppository capsules at home, you will need the following tools: Boric acid powder (not crystals), empty size 0 gelatin capsules, a clean sheet of paper, and a clean kitchen knife.


Boric acid powder should be readily available at most convenience stores such as Walmart, CVS, and Rite Aid. If you cannot find it, a pharmacist can probably order it for you.Look for empty gel capsules at local stores and pharmacies like Walmart, a vitamin or health food store, or order them online.
You may also want to wear latex or rubber gloves, as boric acid can irritate the skin.
 Lay a clean sheet of paper on a flat surface to catch any spills. Over the paper, dip the small tip of your clean knife into the powder and use the knife to carefully spoon the powder into an open capsule. Close the capsule tightly.A capsule should contain around 600mg of boric acid. Fill the capsule with as much powder as it will hold., If you’d prefer, use your sheet of paper like a funnel to fill your capsules. First, make a sharp crease down the middle of the paper. Then put a small amount of boric acid on the paper, and tilt the paper so the powder pours neatly into the capsule until the capsule is full. Close the capsule tightly., It’s okay to make up many capsules at once. Store them in an old vitamin container or other waterproof, sealed container. If possible, put a small packet of silicon in there with them to help prevent moisture. They should keep well for up to a year.Do not store them in the refrigerator.

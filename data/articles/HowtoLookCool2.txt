 It sounds simple enough, but it is so easy to get wrapped up in how-to advice and forget about how cool you are already just for existing. Every person is as unique and offers something different to the world which is a great and beautiful thing. “Cool” isn’t so much an aesthetic as it is a vibe, granted there are things that assist that vibe physically, but a lot of the work happens within. While it is okay to find yourself, it’s never okay to alter yourself just to fit the mold. Embrace what makes you different because that uniqueness is the key to looking cool. When you feel cool, you look cool.


Go against the grain and like what you like, even if it is the road less traveled as far as interests go. If you are into gaming or anime conventions, but people rarely are, do your thing. If you enjoy staying in while others enjoy going out, do you. Don’t force yourself to be a part of what everyone else is doing. Instead find ways to be outgoing while being true to your wants and interest. That just makes you cooler and more interesting.
 Know that even the best people, as with anything, come with good and bad. There are parts of yourself that you won’t like, aspects about your appearance that you wish to change, but instead of punishing yourself for your faults, own them and use them to your advantage. Embracing what makes you unique not only adds to reaffirming your overall sense of self, but it also adds to your confidence.


Knowing not only who you are, but carrying intelligence in other areas of life: music, film, academics, sports adds a cool unique flair to your personality.
 Be upbeat and optimistic. Draw people towards you with your sunny personality and award-winning smile. When you feel good about yourself, it usually bursts out of you and touches others around you, and the more positive and confident you are, the more like-minded individuals you’ll find in your circle. Attracting those personalities naturally round out your cool vibe.

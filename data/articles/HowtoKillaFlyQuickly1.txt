 Get a bottle of Formula 409®, Febreze®, Windex®, or any noxious spray that will not damage the items in your house.


Note: Febreze® might provide the added benefit of acting as a fly deterrent.—No self-respecting fly will inhabit an area that smells fresh and clean, so it will vamoose out of there as quick as can be.;
, You may need five or six on-target squirts to accomplish the job, maybe even as many as twenty if you are a gung-ho, Rambo-style fly killer.


Make sure the bottle has enough spray to completely asphyxiate the fly or, failing that, drown the unfortunate victim.
 Don't approach it from the front or from the side. Instead, creep up from behind. (Make sure to wear your "sneakers." - They are quietly stealthy and will zip you out of there should your victim turn on you.)

, Keep spraying until you're sure the fly is completely dead.
 Remember: the deathly chemicals will need to be cleaned up as well.
 You can give it a proper burial, but it would be inappropriate to "fly" a flag at half mast (unless you were creating a YouTube video and were really into hyperbole).
 Washing your hands is important after killing a fly because flies carry disease and germs. (That is about all they can carry.)


You did know that flies are aerodynamically amazing, right? But, you have never heard tale of a fly being able to carry fifteen or twenty times its weight, have you? Nope, but they do carry germs.

 Use a landline or your friend's phone to try calling your missing iPhone. If it's nearby, you may hear it ring.


Move from room to room as you call your phone.
If you don't have access to another phone, but have access to a computer, try ICantFindMyPhone.com. Enter your phone number on this website and it will call your phone for you.
Check hard-to-reach places.
 Let people know on Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, and any other platforms you're on that your iPhone is missing.
 Police stations and lost property stations in the vicinity of where you lost your iPhone might yield positive results.


You can also file a report if you believe your phone was stolen.
If you have the IMEI/MEID number for your iPhone, give it to the law enforcement official when you file your lost or stolen report. This will help track your phone in case it gets sold to someone else.
 The Missing Phones directory is a website that allows you to enter the IMEI number of your device. Check the database at MissingPhones.org.
 If you're sure that your phone has been stolen, or you don't think you'll ever find it again, contact your carrier as soon as possible. Some carriers allow you to block service for a period of time in case you think you will recover your phone again in the near future.
Dispute any charges incurred if you think your iPhone was stolen.

Note where your lips and teeth are when you make the sounds successfully.

 Intonation helps listeners better comprehend your message and the emotion behind it. To work on your intonation, spend some time watching soap operas in English. Sure, they are corny, but their intonation is usually exaggerated for effect. Use that as a guide to understand when it is appropriate for your voice to go up in pitch or down based on the content of what you are saying.Pick a piece of dialog from a play, for example, and record yourself reading it with the proper intonation. Make recordings over time to see how your intonation has improved or changed with this same piece. By listening to the playback, you can get a better idea of where your voice is off or just right.
 Gestures, coupled with language, can send a powerful message about the strength of your English. English speakers who have native fluency donâ€™t just have all the right words or intonation, they are culturally attuned to the hand gestures and norms (dressing, facial expressions, etc.) that characterize English speakers.Go to a local market and watch people interact; It can be helpful to note people who are your age and gender in particular.

 Eyes take kindly to a woman who takes care of herself.


Find a happy medium for your weight, eat well, get enough sleep, and exercise.

 Blemishes, especially those on the face, can be distracting.


Wash your face regularly, and wear moisturizer and sunblock daily to prevent wrinkles and sun damage.

Take showers, brush your teeth after every meal, and wear clean clothes.
 They say that the hair is the portrait of the face, so make sure it looks great.


Comb and brush your hair every day. Greasy or damaged hair is seldom attractive.
Favor styles that fit your facial shape. Accentuate your natural features instead of fighting against them.
 You don't have to do it every week, but don't be afraid to pamper yourself every once in a while. Get a manicure and pedicure, a massage, or a facial. If you feel good, chances are you'll look good, too.
 Make sure you look your best no matter what. Wear clothes that flatter you, and don't forget to accessorize.


Even if you're wearing sweat pants, dab a little gloss onto your lips and wear gold hoop earrings or a bracelet.
Try wearing a fitted top with loose bottoms, or fitted bottoms with a loose top for an "attractive" outfit.
For more special occasions, try wearing high heeled sandals, a flowy blouse and skinny jeans.

 Locate the Inbox app on your device. It’s the blue envelope with a checkmark. Tap to launch.
 If you logged out of your last Inbox session, you will be asked to log in again. Enter your Google email address and password into the fields provided, and tap “Sign in” to continue.


You will be taken to your inbox folder.
 Scroll through your email list until you find the one you want to move into a different folder. When you find it, tap and hold it; this will highlight the email.
 When the email is highlighted, tap the button with three dots on the top right side of your screen and a list will appear. At the bottom of the list is a button that says “Create new.” Tap it and a window will pop up.


Enter the name of the new folder into the text field in the pop-up, and tap the “Save” button.
The folder will be created and the email you selected will be moved into that fold.

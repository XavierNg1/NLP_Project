 Set up with your back foot off the tail of the board with just your big toe in the pocket. This is exactly the same position as the regular pressure flip. This trick is almost all in the big toe of back foot, so this step is pretty important.

Your front foot can be wherever it is comfortable, perhaps just under the bolts at an angle. Make sure your heel is hanging off as it makes it easier to get the "no comply" part down more easily.;
, When you're rolling and you feel ready to execute the trick, position your feet as described in the step above. If you're not used to pressure flips, it will feel really awkward at first because your back foot should be at a weird angle., This causes the board to pop, either vertically or diagonally if your back foot is in the correct position. When the board pops, scoop under and push forward with your back foot. Remember, only your big toe should be used to pop the board, the rest of your back foot should be off. This doesn't require much effort, just a little nudge.

Since your front foot is on the floor, the jump is pretty simple. Once you scoop the board jump up with your back foot and wait for it to do a full rotation, it should spin like an inward heel flip.
 When you're ready to land, jump up with your front foot (slightly later than your back foot, which jumps as soon as it has scooped). It's a front foot catch, so just hop on and ride away. Your back foot should land nicely on the back bolts.

You may land sketchy a lot to start with, but that's more likely down to the scoop or the push.

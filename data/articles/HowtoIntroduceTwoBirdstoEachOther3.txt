 If you know your bird does not play well with other birds, do not introduce your bird to others. One or the other of the birds could get hurt. You could get hurt too if your bird is introduced to another while sitting on your arm or shoulder., While birds might not understand English (or any other language), they will recognize when something big is about to happen. Keeping your bird informed of situations that concern them is as important as it would be with any other member of your family.
 If you are moving a new cage into the house, for instance, let your bird see it. You can draw your bird’s attention to the cage by commenting, “This is where the new bird’s cage will be,” or something along those lines. You should let your bird see the new cage a few weeks before the new bird arrives., For instance, you could place a stuffed animal on the perch in the cage, or lay a sock similar in color to the bird you’ll soon be introducing to your existing bird over the perch.

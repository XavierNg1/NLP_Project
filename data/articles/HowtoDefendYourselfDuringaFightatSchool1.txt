 If someone else started the fight, you will get in less trouble with friends, family and the law. Nobody will look down on you for defending yourself from a bully, but if you are instigating fights then you should expect consequences for your actions., The best way to end a fight before it even starts is to talk the bully down. Try to make them feel cowardly for wanting to fight you. Shame them for resorting to such immaturity and weakness or simply try to reason with them. Never show them that you are afraid; stand tall and maintain eye contact.

Consider challenging them to an intellectual battle instead.
Remember that you are strong and capable., If you can find a pattern, try to fight back, but use the pattern to help you advance. Paying close attention to the way they move can help you to predict their next move, and can give you an advantage in the fight. Stay alert!, Dodge their punches to make yourself look like an expert fighter. If they do make contact, a kick to their shins, groin, or stomach could prevent another strike from occurring. Hitting them with a powerful elbow to the ribs can also end the fight.Guard your face, as your head is the most sensitive part of you. Bend your arms and hold them in front of your face. Keep your hands clenched into fists so that you can be ready to punch if necessary.
 Punch with your fist held straight, and keep your wrist sturdy or else your wrist could break. Don't put your thumb inside your fist, or it'll break, too. If you're anticipating a possible fight, practice fighting beforehand. Watch videos on YouTube or pick up boxing to polish your skills., However, if the fight is happening on school grounds, you should let go almost instantly. In any case, let them go quickly so that they don't pass out and pin the blame on you. After letting go of them, try to make sure they fall to the ground and pin them down when they do.

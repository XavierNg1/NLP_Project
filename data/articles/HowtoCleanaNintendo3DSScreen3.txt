 When trying to get particles like crumbs out of the edge of the screen, position the Nintendo 3DS with the edge that needs to be cleaned at the top. This ensures that the particles will fall down as you clean it., With your thumb, carefully press the screen close to the edge that needs cleaning. Don’t press too hard. You just want to make a slight space between the screen and the cover.If the debris is really deep in the 3DS, press a bit harder to make a slightly larger gap. However, press carefully so you don’t break the screen.
 Use a new soft toothbrush to clean the debris from the space between the screen and cover. Gently brush the bristles in the space. Move the toothbrush bristles back and forth to loosen the particlesMake sure that the hard part of the toothbrush does not hit the screen. This can damage the screen.

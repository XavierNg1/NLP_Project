 Glads often loose ground to weeds.
, Use one that contains carbaryl or malathion when the gladiolas are around 6 inches (15 cm) tall to protect them from thrips.


Thrips are tiny insects not visible to the naked eye. They cause streaky white leaves and discolored, misshapen, unhealthy flowers. Thrip control must be preventative because once signs of damage are visible, it is too late to save the flowers.
 You can also use stakes and twine to create cluster staking if you are growing several glads close together. Staking and tying these tall flowers helps to minimize storm and wind damage.
 The remaining flowers will continue to open in water.


Harvest the flowers during early morning or evening hours when they are at their freshest.
Cut the flowers with a sharp knife at a diagonal angle. Take care to leave at least 4 to 6 leaves on the plant to mature and nourish the corm that is still growing beneath the soil.

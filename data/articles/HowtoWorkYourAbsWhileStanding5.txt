 Stand up straight, with your feet about shoulder width apart. Hold your arms out in front of you parallel to the ground.Make sure you aren’t close to anything that you might hit. Stay clear of walls, doorways, and other items that you might accidentally hit while jumping. Don't do this exercise on a cement floor.
 Bend at the knees, then jump straight up in the air. Bend your knees upward as you go up.


As you go up, draw your knees as close to your chest as possible. This will help “crunch” your abs, which is what gives them the workout.You shouldn’t be jumping around or in different directions. Make sure you are staying in one place.
 Make sure you are in the same place as when you started. Land with your knees slightly bent to help soften the blow. This is especially important if you are on a hard surface like wood flooring or a tough gym floor.

 This might be heavy weight card or wooden board such as plywood. If you want the sign to be long lasting, plywood or similar wood is the best option. A wooden sign is less likely to blow away in a breeze. Plastic sheeting could also be used but you'll need special special glitter for that, to prevent it from simply peeling right off.;
, The arrow needs to be large to be obvious.


Measure how large you would like the arrow to be. Go to the path area where you want to place the arrow and use a ruler or tape measure to work out a suitable size for the arrow.
Draw the large arrow design on brown paper or similar large paper. Arrow designs are plentiful online, so if you don't want to draw one freehand, print one off to copy or trace over.
Cut the arrow shape out of the paper to make the pattern.

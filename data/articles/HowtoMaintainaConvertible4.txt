 When your convertible top is down, it is folded up tightly in the deck of the vehicle. For a well-conditioned top, this isn’t an issue, but if you leave the top folded for too long, it may result in defined fold lines or even cracks developing in the convertible top’s material.Always put the top up before storing your vehicle or parking it for the night.
It can be impossible to remove lines or cracks in the top without replacing the convertible top itself.
 Whether your convertible folds up automatically or manually, it can be damaged if it is folded onto something. Always make sure the area the top folds into is clear of obstructions and that there is nothing stored in the top’s compartment, otherwise the material of the top or the metal frame for it could be damaged.Check the top’s compartment to ensure nothing has fallen into it before folding the top down.
Make sure nothing is resting on top of the convertible top while it is folded as well.
 Some convertible tops come equipped with vinyl windows. These windows can yellow over time due to exposure to sunlight and accumulating dirt, so use a high quality vinyl cleaner on rear windows if they aren’t made of glass.You can determine if your top is made of glass or vinyl by seeing if it bends. A glass window will not bend.
If your top is also made of vinyl, you may use the same vinyl cleaner to clean the window.
 If your vinyl window has already yellowed, you can purchase a vinyl lens glaze product at most auto parts stores. These cleaners spray onto the vinyl and remove the yellowing, making the window clear once again.Poorly maintained vinyl windows can reduce visibility out of the back of the vehicle.
If your vinyl window is too dark to see though, you may need to have it replaced by a professional.

 There are lots of different kinds of content you can include. Do you want your book to have quotes, song lyrics, Bible verses, poems, letters to the friend, pictures, clips from a book/magazine, or a combination of them?;
, You can be creative with your supplies, depending on what you have at home. Scrap, construction, or cardstock paper are the best options.


Do you want to have your content in a notebook, folder, or string together paper to make a cardboard book?
Use cardboard to paste your paper to, so when you string it together, it isn't flimsy.
 Once you chose where you want your content, you can start making your content. Gather your content so you have all of your content in one place.


You can print out words or pictures. Or you can chose to hand write.
 Using scrap paper, layer your quotes on nice paper. This way you add more dimension to your art then if it was just pasted on your flat paper. Think of it like scrapbooking, and make it as appealing as possible.


When you cut the paper, you can chose to use jagged scissors so that the paper doesn't have completely straight edges.



If you are making your book from scrap, cover your cardboard with nice paper, and then paste the layers of paper with the content on it. Using a hole punch, punch holes along the side so you can connect the pages if there are more than one.
If you are using a notebook, just paste your content, which you layered on more paper, straight into the notebook.
 Using duct tape or more paper, decorate the front of your notebook or cardboard.



Place all your pages in the order you want them to be in.
From there, weave string in and out of the hole in the cardboard.
Tie it at the end. You might have to secure the tie with hot glue.
 Your encouragement book is now ready to give!

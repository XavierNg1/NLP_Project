 Areas that contain likely deposits of lode gold have been explored thoroughly. The inexperienced prospector with minimal capital has little chance of discovering a lode worth developing.



Water enters the ground through cracks and is drawn into hotter regions that are heated by magma or molten rock.
The heated water dissolves many of the rocks around it.
When the magma reaches cooler and shallower rocks, the metals in the hot water show up as veins or as larger and flatter ore bodies.
 As magma moves up through the Earth’s crust, cooling and solidifying, the gold-bearing solutions from the magma are immediately precipitated in granitic rock.



Rocks are forced under continents in mountain building and experience high pressures and temperatures.
Chemical reactions rearrange the rock’s mineral constituents.
Metamorphism causes precious metals to be expelled from the rocks and to move to the surface.

 No matter what is in the background, you actual image will look great with soft lighting. Soft lighting is where shadow transitions are soft, where there aren’t strong shadows on your face or objects around you.


Think about a candlelit room or mood lighting for a romantic dinner, where warm soft light is found all around you.
The best places to find soft light are in open shade, where the light isn’t shining directly on you. This could be on the side of a building or house.
Up lighting, or hard light, can be harsh and highlight undesirable features like wrinkles and baggy eyes. , If possible, try not to have anything directly behind you so you remain the focus of the photo. Solid colors or simple wall patterns are ideal, but make sure you stand out against them.


If you are at a party, step away from the crowd and snap your photo. Go it alone because it is your profile picture so it should be all about you.

If you are in a group photo, try to place yourself in the center.
 The world is filled with natural frames such as alleyways, mountain ranges, trees, doorways, even people! Put these objects around the edge of the photo so you become the main subject. This will make you the main point of interest.
 Divide your image into 9 equal sections by 2 vertical and 2 horizontal lines. Position yourself and or other important images in your scene along these lines or the intersections. This will add balance and interest to your photo. If you are taking a picture with a object or monument, this is an aesthetically pleasing rule to use. Symmetry is very eye catching.

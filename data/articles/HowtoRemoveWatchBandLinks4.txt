 You can do this by attaching one end of the watch strap to its case, then wrapping the strap around your wrist. Count how many of the links are overlapping and add one to this number. The number you come with is the number of links that will need to be removed. With this kind of watch band, you can easily remove links from any part of the band.
 Place the watch face down on your work surface and bend down the top edge flaps of the section you intend to remove.
 Flip the watch over and snap open the bottom edge flaps. These are located directly to the left of the top flaps you opened already.
 Take the link out by sliding the section you wish to remove sideways. This will automatically disengage the staples which hold the links together.
 To do this, you will need to engage the staples on both sides of the strap at the same time, before snapping all of the flaps back into place.

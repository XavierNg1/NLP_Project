 Open the Settings of your device and select “Applications,” or “Application Manager” in some devices. Scroll down the list of apps until you find the app you need to uninstall; tap it, and then tap “Uninstall.”

, Open Google Play and search for the app you just uninstalled. From the search results, tap the 3-dot icon next to the app’s name to open a short context menu.


Tap “Install” on the menu and then “Accept” on the Permissions page that pops up. The app will begin downloading and installing on your device. Wait for it to complete.
 Pull down the Notification panel and tap the “Installation complete” notification from the app to open it, or you can search for the app on your home screen and app drawer, and tap it from there. There shouldn’t be any problems with the app after re-installing it.

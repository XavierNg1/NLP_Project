 Making a list of what is most important to you will help you be more in tune with what you stand for. Once you are clear on your values, your thoughts and emotions can better align with those values and with each other.


Values include things like honesty, empathy toward others, compassion, or consciousness in both thought and action., As you become more certain of your personal values, your thoughts and emotions should become more unified. If you do struggle with conflict from time to time, pull out your list of values. Reminding yourself of what is important to you and the type of person you want to be can help you understand where the conflict is coming from so that you can resolve it.
 Just as your interests and needs can change with time, so can your values. Itâ€™s a good idea to reassess them from time to time. Update your personal values as your life changes.


For instance, when you are a young adult and just entering the working world, you might value hard work and being devoted and dependable.
As you get older with more life experiences, you might begin to take on additional values like empathy and compassion for others., Being confident in who you are and what you stand for can bring about inner peace.Developing a sense of inner peace will help you avoid conflicting thoughts and emotions.



Develop your decision making skills. Working on your decision making skills may help you to feel more confident in your ability to solve problems.
Work on becoming more assertive. Knowing when to speak up for yourself and when to say no may also help to improve your confidence.

Use relaxation techniques to deal with worry and anxiety. Sometimes you may feel overwhelmed by your thoughts and feelings. When this happens, practicing some relaxation techniques may help to calm you down and restore your confidence in yourself. Try doing some deep breathing or a progressive muscle relaxation.

 Focused breathing exercises can promote relaxation, making you feel at peace despite the storms that may be swirling around you. Aim for at least five minutes a day.Try exhaling through your mouth, inhaling through your nose while you count to 4, holding your breath for 7 seconds, and exhaling completely through your mouth while you count to eight. Do this 4 times.
 Meditation helps calm the mind and regulate our breathing. Sit in a quiet room with your eyes partially closed. Breathe slowly in and out through your nose. Be mindful of your breath but don't attempt to control it.
 Yoga focuses on controlling the breath as an integral part of the practice.There are multiple types of yoga with some, like hatha yoga, focusing more on breath than others. Check out a class at your local gym or attend a free class online in the comfort of your living room.

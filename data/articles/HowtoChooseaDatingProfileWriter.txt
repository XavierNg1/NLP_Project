 If it is not fresh, engaging and clear, then move on. Why would you trust your personal happiness to someone who runs a site with grammatical errors, who can't impress you with their own content, and who doesn't have a story to share?;
, Do they look like they care about you? Do you think you could trust them with your private information or do they look like they'll hand you over to a cheaper junior to do the job?

, What is the level of service they will give you? Is it just a rewrite of your current profile or will they manage everything from choosing your avatar, selecting a flattering photo, interview you to find our more about you, help you choose a site, and then assist with managing replies to your profile?

, How knowledgeable are they about the huge range of sites out there? Do they offer any tips and suggestions for starting conversations or where to go on the first date? Can they help your spot a scam on a dating site?

, How quickly can they get your profile ready for you?

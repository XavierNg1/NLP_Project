 Whether your spouse stays faithful in the future is entirely up to them. No matter how carefully you check up on them, if your spouse wants to cheat again, they will find a way. Likewise, if they are committed to fixing their mistake, you won’t have to try to control them.Remind yourself that you have proven through this process that you can take care of yourself and survive no matter what happens.
 Sit down with your spouse and think about what you want your relationship to look like in the future. Make some step-by-step plans for turning your goals into reality. Working towards a common target puts you and your spouse on the same team, helping you to rebuild camaraderie and trust., It’s valid for you to request access to your spouse’s phone and online activity after they cheat on you. However, they still have a right to privacy. Talk with your spouse about how you will balance privacy and accountability in the future.If your spouse remains secretive about their online or phone activity, consider whether they are really committed to helping you trust them again.
 No one is a mind reader, and it’s easy to imagine problems where there are none. Focus on the facts. Don’t let yourself get caught up in fears that your spouse is planning to cheat on you again unless there’s a concrete reason.Do a reality check with yourself when your imagination runs away with you. Stop and ask yourself, “Why am I thinking this? Is there a more likely explanation?”
Also, remind yourself that if they are cheating, then they will likely mess up and get caught again. You don’t have to constantly be on the lookout, so allow yourself to let go of this responsibility.

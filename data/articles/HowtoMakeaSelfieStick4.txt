 Downloading an app will help stabilize the camera and automate some of a photographer's tasks, such as timing and framing.


Camera 360 is a good app to download if you're in the habit of taking selfies.
 Because the perceived weight will increase the farther out your extend the pole, it's a good idea to limit the reach at a few feet in front of you.


Most impromptu DIY selfie sticks (such as those made from actual sticks) aren't adjustable per se, but you can draw the camera closer by holding the stick further up its length.
Adjust the angle of the selfie stick to your liking while you're at it. Make sure the camera is level when you take a picture.
 Because you'll still need to press the button to make it work, it is preferable that your phone have a timer function. If this is the case, you should set it for 5-10 seconds. This will give you enough time to get into a natural position after pressing the button.


Alternatively, you can use a secondary stick (such as a conductor's wand) to press the button.
Make sure the phone camera is evenly levelled before you take a picture.
 For some DIY selfie sticks, you may want to disassemble it as soon as you've achieved your perfect shot. With others, like a flagpole setup, you should place them somewhere where excess pressure won't be placed on any part of it. Remove the phone when you're done taking a photo and retract the pole as much as you can.


Putting a selfie stick in a closet is a good call, as closets tend to have a lot of vertical space available.

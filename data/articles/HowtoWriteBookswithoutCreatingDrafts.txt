 If you read different types of books, from Jacqueline Wilson to Little Women to Harry Potter, you get inspiration and ideas. Let all of these inspirations sit inside your mind and work their way around. This is creativity building.;
, Just sit at your computer and write everything down in one go. Let the flow take over and let it out, whatever it is. The important thing is that a computer makes it really easy for you to come back to it afterwards and change things if you want. Rough drafts have a dreadful habit of creating changes for the sake of change until you have shaped something so different from what you started with that it no longer seems what you wanted.
 Have a general feel for how you want them to be but don't fill in all the blanks; leave some mystery for development. Let them surprise you as you fill them out while writing. People in real life do that; so can your characters.
 Nothing set in concrete but some basic guidance posts. If this is too hard, if the end is so amorphous and as yet unplanned, don't bother your head with it. It will come as you write; if you are an intuitive, jump-in-and-do-it type, getting hung up on the ending can bottle up the whole tale. Likely its in your mind somewhere but will wend its way out as the characters and plot develop.
 Lose yourself in it. It's the only way to get a brilliant story if you put your whole heart in to it. Create alter egos and your own little world. Don't write because you have to, write because you want to.

 If a website could be compared to a book, webpages are the pages that make up the book, and keywords describe the content you are promoting on a given page.;
, "Party balloons," "Calvin Klein t-shirts," and "Game of Thrones on HBO" are good examples of keywords.


The more concise your keywords, the easier it will be for users to find your content. However, prioritize clarity over conciseness. If you're creating a Game of Thrones fan site, your visitors would probably search for "Game of Thrones" instead "Game Thrones."
Don't get too specific. Your site might focus on a specific line of Hot Wheels cars, for example, but users not as familiar with particular products name (such as parents shopping for the items on Little Timmy's list to Santa) will likely think in general terms such as "Hot Wheels cars".
 The URL is the web address of a page. A title tag is the title you give a webpage, such as "Blue Calvin Klein T-shirts" or "Order Party Balloons now!"/ Header tags are used to create section headers on a page, which help you organize content. For example, one header might be called "Animal-themed Party Balloons" while another could be called "Blue Party Balloons."


Website-creation software like WordPress and Adobe Dreamweaver let you create titles and headers without worrying about creating the HTML code that makes your website tick. All you need to worry about is creating succinct keywords and using them appropriately on relevant pages.

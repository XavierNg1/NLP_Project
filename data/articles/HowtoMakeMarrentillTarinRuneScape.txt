Collect a marrentill herb. Invest in clean marrentill for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy Marrentills are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming.
Collect 15 lumps of swamp tar. Go around either Mort Myre Swamp (north of the swamp boat) or Lumbridge Swamp to pick them up.
 You can store it into your tool belt indefinitely.
 This will give you 15 marrentill tar.

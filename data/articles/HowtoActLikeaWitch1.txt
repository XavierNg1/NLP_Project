 Witches are usually dressed in black or dark purple and blue colors. Long robes, cloaks, and flowing clothes are the best witch garments.


Mix colors to use layers. If you're a female witch, wear an old victorian-style black dress with a dark shawl or cloak over it. If you're a male, wear a dark tunic or suit.
Witch costumes are often kind of silly and tame looking. If you really want people to think you're a witch, it's better to avoid the Halloween stores in favor of antique shops and second-hand stores.;
, Witches immediately bring to mind long, scraggly hair. If yours is short, grow it out or get a wig to make your hair appear longer. Style it by avoiding washing for a few days, then letting it hang down over your face.


Consider adding color to your hair. A long streak of gray, purple, or white can help to give you a witchy look, depending on your hair style and color.
If your hair is blonde, that can look perfectly witchy. It's not necessary to have dark hair to look witch-like.
 Having long fingernails just looks creepy and witchy, male or female. It's an easy way that you can make yourself look different, for a costume or for a cosplay trip.


If you don't want long fingernails on every finger, just grow out a few. Having a really long ring-finger nail? That'll look awesomely creepy.
 Use some very pale foundation on your face, and darken your eyes and lips to start looking witchy. Use the make-up subtly. Green make-up and fake warts usually looks more silly than witchy. It's probably better to avoid it.
 There are lots of different kinds of little props that you can use to create a witchy look, aside from the stereotypical broom and black cat. If you're creating a witch costume, keep an eye out for the following witchy props:


Big rings
Long necklaces and pendants
Corsets
Stockings
Scarves and shawls
Jewelry with bones or teeth
Animal pelts
Crystals or gems

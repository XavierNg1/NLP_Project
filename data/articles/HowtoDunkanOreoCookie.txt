 Make sure they are the original cookies and not the new vanilla Oreos. While at the store, pick up a gallon or half gallon of milk. (2 L - 4 L) If you think you are going to spill much of the milk, go with the gallon (4 L), but if you are a neat and tidy eater, go with the half gallon (2 L). If you already have milk, make sure it's fresh.;
, Grab a glass from the cupboard and fill the glass with milk to about a half an inch (12.7 mm) from the top. This is the optimal height for dunking the cookie.
 Pick one cookie up gently so as not to break or chip it. Raise the cookie until it is positioned approximately 1.5 inches (38.1 mm) from the rim of the glass.
 If you submerge the whole cookie at once, air will become trapped inside the cookie and will not allow the milk to soak in.
 Do not swirl the cookie around or move it around in the milk. You could risk breaking the cookie and losing it forever in the depths of your glass of milk. After exactly 6 seconds have elapsed, slowly remove the cookie from the milk.
 Place the cookie on your tongue, chew, and enjoy!!

, Small bubbles will then rise to the surface. When it stops bubbling quickly take the Oreo out of the milk and place it in your mouth. Always keep a napkin close to you so you can wipe the excess milk off your fingers. This is a time sensitive maneuver but it creates optimum milk cookie ratio for the greatest taste! You can also try "Peanut butter Oreos" the same way...very delicious!

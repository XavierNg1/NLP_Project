What is due this week and next?
Do you need to make any changes to your original study plan?
Jot down on each "Study time" what you plan to cover, for example, Monday at 4:30 pm you already had written "Study Statistics."  From reviewing what is due, you see that Chapter 4 homework is due by Friday. So, on the 4:30 Monday study time, you would add the note "CH 4 HW."
By taking time over the weekend to identify what you need to do during each study time, you will save yourself a lot of time during your busy week. When you are running fast from work to school and sit down in the library at 4:30 for an hour of study before class, you can quickly look at the calendar and pull out chapter 4 of the statistics book and you do not have to spend 10 or more minutes trying to remember what is due.
 Just as you would not blow-off an appointment with someone important, then do not blow off your study times with yourself. You and your education goals are just as important as other commitments in your life.
 Do not hesitate to change your "Working Plan" if it is not meeting your study needs.

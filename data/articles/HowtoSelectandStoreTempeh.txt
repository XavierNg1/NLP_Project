Check the expiration date. Tempeh lasts a long time (several months), so there should be plenty of time on the expiration date.;
, It should be used before the expiration date. It can also be frozen for up to three months. If frozen, it can be thawed as follows:



Microwave on high for 45-60 seconds sitting on a paper towel.
Defrost at room temperature. Place the sealed frozen tempeh into a bowl of hot water to speed it up.
Defrost in the refrigerator overnight.
 Refrigerate it for up to another 5 days.


If the tempeh has gray or black spots on it, this simply alerts you to the mold being alive. It can still be eaten.
If the tempeh is slimy or smells like ammonia, dispose of it.
 Tempeh has many uses. It can be fried as slices, eaten as cubes in stews and stir-fries, crumbled into many different dishes from lasagna to casseroles, etc. Excellent for pureeing, crumbling, dicing, and slicing, strips of it can also be toasted or fried and placed into salads. The only thing to be careful about is the ease with which it absorbs oil, so simply brush it with oil rather than frying it in a depth of oil.

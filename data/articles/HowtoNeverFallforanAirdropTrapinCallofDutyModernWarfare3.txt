 Now run around until an enemy kills you (you cannot kill yourself). Watch the KillCam. The icon will show up which one is real.;
, Most people know that SitRep highlights Claymores, Bouncing Bettys, and grenades in a bright red. But what most people don't know is that it also highlights airdrops. If there is a care package that isn't glowing rd, then it is legit.
 If the announcer recently said "Enemy has Juggernaut", or something like that, then it is a real care package. If not, it is a trap.
 If one of these is supposedly in a care package, then it is a trap.
 If no enemies come for it, then it is probably a trap.

 Learn the controls of the game. Bop It is a game that yells out commands that you have to complete on the device. There are five things you have to know to do when Bop It tells you to:

Pull it: when you hear "Pull It!", pull on the blue handle, hard so it will recognize it, as fast as you can.






Twist it: when you hear "Twist It!" twist the yellow crank forwards, hard so it recognizes, as fast as you can.






Bop it: when you hear "Bop It!" 'bop' the white crank, hard enough that it recognizes, as fast as you can.






Spin it: when you hear "Spin It!", spin the red wheel as fast as you can.






Shout it: when you hear "Shout It!", shout any loud sound into the microphone very fast because it only waits for a few seconds.
 Party mode is the same as solo and pass it, but it includes body parts that you must bop the game on. If the player is holding Bop It, and a body part of called out, such as a leg, shoulder, arm, hip, foot, belly or knee must bop it with after it is called. There's a party mode setting on Bop It, which you can just set it to once you are ready to play.
 This game requires a minimum of two players so you have enough people to pass to. When Bop It yells the command, accomplish it, and then when it yells "Pass It!", pass the device to the person on your right hand side as quick as you can.

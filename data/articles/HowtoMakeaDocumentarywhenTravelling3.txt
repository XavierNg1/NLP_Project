Camera. Standard definition, you can pick up good second hand DV camcorders. Good value HD cameras are DSLRs such as the 550d but beware you cannot film handheld.
2nd camera. This is very useful as it means that you can be very efficient with your time as you can capture twice as much footage. So in the long run it will help you keep to schedule and stay calm. If size and weight is an issue you can get excellent small HD cameras such as the Nikon v1, but with less manual features.
Tripod. Do you need one which is light weight or has a fluid head for smooth pans and tilts.
4 spare batteries. Hahnel makes good batteries which are cheaper than the originals.
Tapes. Bring a lot more than you will need bring a dozen.
Lens cloths. Microfiber cloths are good.
External microphone. Getting good sound is crucial and this is best achieved with an external microphone. An excellent affordable recorder is the zoom h1.
Headphones. These are also important to getting good sound. These should be over the ear so they can reduce background noise.
Polarizing filter. Helps protect lens and reduce reflections.
TV cable. So you can log your footage on a bigger screen.
 (Expensive insurance). Consider whether you need a powerful computer which you can edit on such as the Macbook Pro or just a cheap laptop to transfer files.
Voltage stabilizer. This is needed in India.
External hard drive to back footage onto. Consider a lacie rugged. Recently the Solid state drive, a very stable and fast storage system has come onto the market but it is still very expensive.
Memory cards. Bring at least 4 16GB cards.
 Work out what are your priority shots and draw up a schedule for each shooting day. Consider using a second camera when filming as this means you can film twice as much.


Keep a diary. This way you can write how you felt about the shoot, what mistakes you made and what you will do differently next time.

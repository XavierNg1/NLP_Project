 This will get rid of any extra gunk that can be taken off with regular soapy water. Start with cups that are as clean as possible., If your cup isn't already wet, dampen it with some hot water. It's easier to remove the stain when there is little moisture present for the baking soda to cling to., Half a teaspoon or so should do the trick. You only need enough to make a light paste.
 A paste-like film should form as you rub over the dampened cup. Concentrate on places where the stain is darkest.
 Put some effort into rubbing directly over the stained areas of the cup. Continue doing this until the stain lifts. You may need to turn the cup around as you are scrubbing, to ensure that you reach all areas of the stain., Remove the baking soda residue from the cup with warm water. Check that you have removed the entire stain. If it's gone, turn the cup upside down and leave to air dry before returning to its usual storage spot.
 If you still see remnants of the stain after a good scrubbing, repeat the process with more baking soda. It will usually come off after an extra treatment or two.

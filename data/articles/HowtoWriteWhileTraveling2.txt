 If you rely on a laptop or other electronic device to work, this will command where and how you work. If you do not have a stable connection, you will need to find another suitable location, such as a cafe or a library to do your typing.
 Model it on your ideal work station at home, where you have elements like quiet, food or beverages, and a comfortable chair.
 Set a watch and do as much work as you can inside 1 to 3 hours. After that, take a break and enjoy your destination; the break may increase your productivity in your next session.
 If you are traveling with other people, opt to write while you are alone. If that is not possible, put some head phones in your ears and journal without talking to other people.
 People often forget the names, dates, places and other important details of their travel as soon as the next day. Force yourself to sit down for 15 minutes and note all the emotions and excitement of the day.
 They will understand if you tell them ahead of time that you will be unavailable occasionally.
 Make sure you schedule a few days without any work to enjoy your destination. If you are journaling, continue to do so for a few minutes every night, even on weekends.
 For example, if you are waiting for a train, sitting on a coach traveling to your next destination or waiting to meet people for dinner. This time can be used to jot down notes or journal.

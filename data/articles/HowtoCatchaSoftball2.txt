 This is the fly ball equivalent to getting in front of the ball. Since the ball will be coming from up in the air down to you, you need to move the spot where you think the ball is going to land. Be patient for a few seconds until you have the spot in mind before you move to it. You want the ball to come down slightly in front of you and slightly toward to your throwing side., You will need to catch a fly ball over your head rather than at chest level, so once you have gotten to roughly the spot where you think the ball will land, raise your arm into the air. Point your fingers up to the sky and make sure the palm is slightly horizontal to give the ball a place to land. Keep your elbow slightly bent, and donâ€™t lock it in place., This should be done as you raise your arm. You may not have much time between getting to the right spot, raising your arm, and making the catch, so be sure to keep your mitt hand loose while you run and open as you raise the arm.
 Just like in line drive catches, your ungloved hand is used to clench the ball in your glove and make sure you keep hold of the catch. Your hand should be touching the side of the glove when your arm is in the air. If you are going to need to throw the ball quickly, having this hand right by your glove will make the movement smoother.
 If you know a softball is coming from high up, you want to be patient until you have an idea where it is going to land. It is best to make the catch while moving forward rather than backward because you keep everything in your sight. So when positioning yourself, plan for the ball to land slightly in front of you and then move forward to get completely under it.

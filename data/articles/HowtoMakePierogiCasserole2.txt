 Cut one 8-ounce (225 g) package of cream cheese into cubes. Place the cubes in a small saucepan with 4 cups (946 ml) of chicken broth. Turn the heat on low and stir the cream cheese until it melts.If you're short on time, you could just toss the cubed cream cheese into the crock pot, but you may have lumps in your finished casserole.
 Open three 16-ounce (456 g) packages of frozen pierogis and put them in a 5-quart slow cooker. Slice 1 pound (453 g) of kielbasa and add it to the slow cooker. Stir in the remaining ingredients until the casserole is combined. You'll need to stir in:The melted cream cheese and broth mixture
1 cup (100 g) of shredded cheddar cheese
Salt and pepper to taste

, Put the lid on the slow cooker and turn it on to HIGH for 3 to 4 hours. If you want to cook it for longer, turn it on to LOW for about 6 hours. The pierogi should become soft and hot, while the cheese should bubble a little.Consider serving the casserole with a green salad or crusty bread (like baguette).

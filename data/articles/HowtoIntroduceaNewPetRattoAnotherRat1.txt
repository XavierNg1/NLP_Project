 Wash your hands between handling your rats. Some people choose to quarantine new rats from the others for several weeks.;
, This should get them curious about each other and used to seeing and smelling each other. It's normal for your rats to be a little agitated at first, but if they are constantly very upset and aggressive (hissing, puffing up fur, etc.), move the cage farther apart for a while before moving them closer again. DON'T ever place the cages within 6 inches of each other. The rats can reach through the bars and intentionally or accidentally harm each other.
 Don't have them out of their cages at the same time.They will smell each other on your hands and get used to each other. After they are comfortable with seeing each other through the bars, start switching things in their cages. Put a paper towel in each cage and the next day, switch the towels. Or switch their hammocks, chew sticks, or water bottles. Do this every day for a while. At least a week is ideal.

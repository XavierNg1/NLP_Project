 If you have decided that you have warm undertones the colors that will look best on you belong to the earth tone family. These include yellows, reds, and browns. Avoid icy shades and jewel tones.
 If you discover undertones of blue, pink, rose or purple, you're considered to have a cool skin tone. People with cool undertones look best in blues, purples, or greens. Avoid oranges and yellows.
 When you are deciding on your dress color it is important to keep in mind that your skin has both a surface tone and undertone. You could have dark warm skin or dark cool skin. Similarly, you may have light warm skin or light cool skin. Typically the surface tone will help you determine the shade of colour and your undertone will help you decide on the color itself.


For example, if you have dark skin you will look good in bold colours. If you have dark warm skin you may want to choose a bright yellow or red to compliment the warm undertones. If you have dark cool skin you will look best in a bright blue or silver.

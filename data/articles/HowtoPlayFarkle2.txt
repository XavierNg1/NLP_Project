 Determine who will roll first by having each player roll one die; whoever gets the highest score is the first player, as in the standard Farkle game.
 Common variations include:


A straight (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) on one roll is worth 1,500, 2000, or 3000 points or no points.
Three pairs (e.g., 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5) is scored as 500, 600, 750, 1,000, or 1,500 points.
A full house (three of a kind and a pair) is worth the three of a kind value plus 250 points (e.g., 3, 3, 3, 2, 2 = 550 points).
Two sets of three of a kind: 2,500 points
Four of a kind is scored as 1,000 points, or double the three of a kind value, or quadruple the three of a kind value.
Five of a kind is scored as 2,000 points, or triple the three of a kind value, or six times the three of a kind value.
Six of a kind is scored as 3,000 points, or quadruple the three of a kind value, or eight times the three of a kind value.
Six 1s are worth 5000 points, or the player is instantly declared the winner., Common variations include:


Playing with five dice instead of six. Some scoring combinations (e.g. three pair) are not possible in this version of Farkle.
Playing in teams, rather than individually. Players on the same team combine their scores and sit opposite other teams.
Establishing a threshold in players' opening turns before they can begin scoring. Common thresholds are 350, 400, 500, and 1,000. At the beginning of the game, each player must throw in their turn until they reach the threshold; after that point, they can choose to stop or keep rolling in all subsequent turns.
Changing the winning score to greater or less than 10,000 points (e.g., 20,000 or 5,000 points). Another option is to make the score exactly 10,000 points, which is called the "welfare" version of Farkle. If a player scores above 10,000, all points won during that turn are transferred to the player with the lowest score.
Changing the farkling rules. If a player farkles three times in a row, he/she loses 500 or 1,000 points.
Allowing players to begin their turn by rolling the dice remaining from the previous player's roll (those dice not set aside for scoring). If the player scores with any of the dice on the first roll, they receive 1,000 points in addition to any other points they win. This is called the High Stakes (Piggy-backing) variant., Take turns in a clockwise direction and roll until a winner is declared. Have fun!

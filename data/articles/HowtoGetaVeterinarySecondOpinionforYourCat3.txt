 Generally speaking, a "second opinion" mean you are seeking the advice of an equally qualified general practitioner. A "referral" on the other hand, means you are seeking the advice of a specialist.If you simply don't trust to prognosis or treatment plan of your current vet, you may choose to see another general practitioner.
However, most of the time, you will be able to gain greater insight into your cat's health problems by seeking the help of a specialist.
 Don't be afraid to discuss this with your vet. Explain that you'd like to seek the advice of a specialist and ask for a referral. In some cases, it may even be your vet's idea for you to seek the care of a specialist. Your vet simply wants the best care for your cat.Different types of veterinary specialists include:

Behavioral specialists
Surgeons
Internists
Ophthalmologists
Dermatologists
Oncologists
Dentists

, If your current vet has not been able to provide a referral, you can turn to friends and family, search the internet, and make some phone calls in order to find a specialist. Ask your cat-owning friends and family if they can recommend the specialist you need. Perform an internet search for feline-based veterinary specialists. Once you locate some potential veterinarians, call each one and explain your situation. Select the doctor who seems best able to accommodate your needs, and make an appointment.A practice that is listed as "secondary referrals only" means that they only accept patients referred by other vets and do not take appointments directly from the public.

 The seller should have a high positive feedback rating (preferably at least 90 percent). It is safest to purchase from top-rated sellers (with a "Top-rated seller" badge next to their name).
 This will take you to the seller's feedback profile where you can see detailed feedback ratings and comments made about the seller.
 Don't buy from the seller if you see suspicious activity, such as valuable items being sold at very low prices.

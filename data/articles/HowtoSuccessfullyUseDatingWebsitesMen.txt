, "U" and "R" are letters, not words. Many women find intelligence attractive.
 Messages like "Hey" or "Hi how are you?" are not going to strike up interesting conversation. Ask open-ended questions and comment on something you found interesting in her profile. Try to skip the stereotypical small-talk questions too.
 So, focus on her personality, and save the compliments for when you actually meet her in person.
 Share your interests, describe your personality, and keep it positive. No rants about what you dislike, bad past experiences, or ex-girlfriends.

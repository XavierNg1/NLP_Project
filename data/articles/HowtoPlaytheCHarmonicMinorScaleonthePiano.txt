 Make sure you know this by heart to guide you through the tutorial.;
, The notes are C D E♭ F G A♭ B C


Notice that there are two flats: E♭ and A♭. They are both black keys.
Write the notes down forward and backwards mentally for memorization.
Say them out loud forwards and backwards.



We'll start with the right hand. The thumb is number 1. The pointing finger is number 2. The middle finger is number 3. The ring finger is number 4, and the pinky is number 5.
Know the numbers that indicate fingers on the left hand. It's the same as the right hand. The thumb is number 1. The pointing finger is number 2. The middle finger is number 3. The ring finger is number 4. The pinky is number 5. Here is the diagram, which illustrates this:

, Here is a diagram that will help you memorize what keys each finger is supposed to press.


For the right hand, the fingering is 123 1234 123 12345.
Now say this, thumb, pointer, middle, thumb, pointer, middle, ring, thumb, pointer, middle, thumb, pointer, middle, pointer, pinky.
Make sure to remember the numbers corresponding to the fingers. Thumb is number 1, etc.
For the left hand, the fingering is 54321 321 4321 321.
Now say this: pinky, ring, middle, pointer, thumb, middle, pointer, thumb, ring, middle, pointer, thumb, middle, pointer, and thumb.
 Remember, the fingering is 123 1234 123 12345. The first finger, which is the thumb, will play the C note.
,, Remember, we're on the second set of numbers 1234 in the 123 1234 123 12345 fingering.
,,, Slide your thumb under to hit the C note again, and repeat the same pattern again for this octave except the last C!

, Remember the 123 1234 123 12345 pattern. The pinky indicates number 5. You finished the right hand!

, This will be different, because the pinky will start off. The pattern is 54321 321 4321 321. The pinky hits the C note.
,,,, Your fingers will get use to this and you'll get faster. Guaranteed. Just do everything slow!

, We're on the 2 of the second 321 in the 54321 321 4321 321 fingering pattern. Always keep track of the fingering.
 Hit the C note with your thumb.
 The rest of the notes should be self-explanatory. The D is the ring finger. The ring finger is number 4 of the 4321 set of numbers. The 3 is the middle finger, so use the middle finger to hit the E♭ note and continue the fingering until you reach the last C.
 Strike it with number 1(the thumb)! You're finished with the left hand! Now practice this with both the left and right hand until it's memorized by heart. Then you can put both hands together or practice it backward.

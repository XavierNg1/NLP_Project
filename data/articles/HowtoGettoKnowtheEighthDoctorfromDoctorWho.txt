 The movie is a great place to start, since not only does it have Paul McGann as the title character, but it officially ends the classic series and makes way for the new series that we all know and love.;
, These are the continued travels of the Eighth Doctor in book form. Start with "The Eight Doctors", as it is the first book in the series. If you have a Kindle, read it on that as buying an actual print is a little over $200.
 These comics have superb art, great dialogue, and shows the darker side of Paul's Doctor. I personally recommend reading "The Flood" which is the last Eighth Doctor comic story published in Doctor Who Magazine.
 These audio adventures are great. With these, you have the power to decide the direction. You can have the Doctor wear any costume you want, you can let the companions look like whatever you want, and you can make the enemies as threatening as you want. Here are some good places to start with your audio adventures:


Storm Warning (Very first Eighth Doctor Audio Drama from Big Finish)
Blood of the Daleks Part One (First appearance of Lucie Miller)
Dark Eyes (First appearance of Molly O'Sullivan and the Doctor's new costume)

,, The TV movie had a few continuity errors, which the BBC Books series fixed and explained. The BBC Books are considered to be part of a paradox which happened when the Doctor resurrected Gallifrey after a different Time War from the one in the new series (since in the books, the Time Lords fought the Faction Paradox instead of the Daleks). No one's really sure whether or not the comics stories are actually part of the continuity of the show or not. The audio adventures are the only form of media that have been confirmed as canon.

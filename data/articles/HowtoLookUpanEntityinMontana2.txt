 Some companies put digital copies of their annual reports or other business documents on their website for public access.A company's annual report is one of the most comprehensive reviews of the company's finances, including its annual income, its expenses and investments, and its overall financial strength.
Larger companies also routinely make their annual reports available to financial reporters and journalists, so a search of financial news websites and magazines may bring up additional information, including analyses or summaries.You also may be able to use free websites such as annualreports.com, which provides a searchable listing of corporate annual reports that are available on the internet., If the company is required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, you can find those by searching EDGAR.


All publicly traded companies must file regular financial reports with the SEC, which are collected in the commission's EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) system. This includes the company's 10-K annual reports, 10-Q quarterly reports, and other forms that may contain important financial data.You can search EDGAR on the SEC's website,but the search tools there aren't very sophisticated. There are some more user-friendly sites that allow you to search SEC filings, but you'll have to pay a subscription fee for access., You can search for the name of a Montana business entity on the BBB website to learn more about its customer service reputation.

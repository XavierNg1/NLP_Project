 Using a warm compress is one of the easiest ways to ease pain from a cyst and encourage it to drain as well.Get a clean washcloth and hold it under warm to hot running water. Then, wring out the excess water and apply the washcloth to your cyst. Hold it there for about five minutes or until the washcloth becomes cool. You can repeat this process several times per day.
 Use a mild soap to wash around the area of your cyst and allow the water and soap to run over the cyst.Try not to apply too much pressure to the cyst itself or you may irritate it or cause it to burst and this can lead to infection.
 If your cyst bursts or starts to drain fluid, place a clean, loose fitting cotton bandage over the cyst to catch the fluid. Change the bandage often and keep the area clean., Do not try to squeeze, pop, or puncture a cyst or it may become infected.This might be hard to do, especially if the cyst is bothering you, but popping or puncturing a cyst will make it worse and you may have scars as a result.

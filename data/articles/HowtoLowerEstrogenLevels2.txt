 Estrogen is metabolized and filtered by the liver, but high levels of alcohol can decrease liver function. When liver function decreases, estrogen levels can increase.If you have borderline high estrogen levels, limit your alcohol consumption to one glass per day or less. If you are already experiencing estrogen dominance, however, cut alcohol out of your diet completely.
 Roughly 80 percent of estrogens acquired through diet come from cow's milk and dairy products made with cow's milk.Opt for non-dairy milk products, like almond milk or rice milk, instead.


Cows are often milked during pregnancy, when their estrogen levels are highest, which is why cow's milk can contain such high doses of estrogen.
When you do consume dairy, choose helpful dairy sources. Yogurt can be especially beneficial since it contains probiotics.
 Caffeine, fat, and sugar can all increase estrogen levels in the body, so you should limit these foods as much as possible.


For instance, even one cup of regular coffee can increase estrogen levels.Drinking up to four cups a day can raise your estrogen levels by as much as 70 percent., Soy contains plant compounds called "isoflavones" that mimic estrogen, so if you have high estrogen levels in your body, consuming unfermented soy can aggravate the estrogen's effects.


Unfermented soy products include tofu and soy milk.
 Red meat can contain hormone additives, and these additives can boost estrogen levels in your body or behave like estrogen in the body.When you do eat meat, look for meat labeled as “organic” or “natural.” Consuming this meat will still cause you to consume the estrogen left over from the animal's natural stores, but you will not consume any abnormally excessive amounts of estrogen this way.

 You only need to shoot one Plasma Launcher round to kill a Spartan or Elite. So shoot only as you are about to die. So that way not only did they kill you but you also killed them and you got a "Kill From The Grave Metal".
 Plus it homes in on your target so lock on to any vehicle and wait until all four shots are charged up then shoot it will home in on your target (this goes for players too).



Note: If an enemy goes behind a wall most likely your charges will miss.

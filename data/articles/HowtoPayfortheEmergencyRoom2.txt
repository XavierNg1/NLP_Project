 Contact the emergency room medical care providers that sent the bill and tell their billing departments that you are requesting an account audit to look for billing errors. Facilities don't perform this service unless a patient asks for one.


Inform the representative that you will be investigating the bills and will not send payment until you confirm the accuracy of every charge.
 A medical billing professional may be able to locate errors in your bill, such as coding mistakes, duplicate charges, or overcharges.
 Document any unnecessary charges you find on paper or in a spreadsheet. Then contact the facilities that sent you the bill to discuss the charges.


Look for inflated prices such as overpriced bandages. Compare and document hospital charges for those items against their retail cost in a pharmacy.
Ensure that you received all of the treatments listed on the bill.
 If you have been denied coverage, exercise your right to Challenge an HMO's Denial of Coverage.
 No matter how you identified inaccurate charges, you should receive an updated bill. Review the charges and the amount you owe for accuracy.


Be sure to explain to the facility that you will not pay anything until the correct bills are sent. Doing so can indicate that you agree to the original charges.

 As soon as you bring home your dog, you should decide what rooms they can go into and ones they cannot. You should also decide what other areas are off-limits, such as the couch, the beds, or other furniture.


For example, you may not want to let your dog in your bedroom, but your roommate is okay with the dog going in their bedroom. You both may decide not to let the dog upstairs.
 You should never make a social space where your family gathers off-limits to your dog. Your dog needs companionship and to be around you and your family. Otherwise, there is no purpose of having a pet. Make sure at least the living room or den area is available for your dog.For example, don’t sequester your dog to an empty bedroom, an unused den, or a laundry room when the family is home. You may choose to keep them in a laundry room or kitchen during the day, though.
 Dogs often have smaller areas where they can roam than adult dogs. This is usually due to chewing or not being house trained. As your dog grows and learns not to chew and becomes house trained, you may choose to expand where your dog is allowed.Evaluate your dog’s behavior and determine if you would like to let them in new places. Just remember, be consistent. If you do not want them in your bedroom, don’t let them in for a day or two and then change your mind.

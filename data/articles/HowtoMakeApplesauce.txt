 The kind of apple to use is up to you. You can use this recipe if you have slightly mushy apples you don't want to eat out of hand.






;
, Cut them into cubes that are roughly 1". They don't need to be uniform but try not to make them too different in size.
 Put them in a pot large enough to hold them all and add enough water to cover the bottom of the pan. You don't want to boil them; you want to steam them, so add liquid accordingly.
 Add about 2 teaspoons of lemon juice (or some other citric) to slow down oxidation and a pinch of salt to help break down the apples.
 Put the pot over high heat. Once the liquid boils, reduce the heat to medium low and cover. Allow the apples to cook, stirring occasionally, until they're tender. It will take 20 to 30 minutes depending on how you prefer them.
 When they're done cooking, mash them with a fork or a potato masher for a chunky applesauce or blend them with an immersion blender for a smooth one.
 Add sugar or cinnamon if you like, and serve either warm or cool.

 The heat from the washer is often all thatâ€™s necessary to completely clean a bottle. Unlike boiling the bottles, it does not remove all bacteria though., Wash the bottle parts with soap and water, and place them in the microwave separately. Run for about ninety seconds and allow time to cool., Purchase non-toxic sterilization tablets produced by companies such as Milton and dissolve in a container of cold water. Allow bottles to soak in the water for a minimum of thirty minutes. They can be rinsed when finished, but are safe to use immediately afterwards.

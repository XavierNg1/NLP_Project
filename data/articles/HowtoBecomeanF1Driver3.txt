 Formula 1 requires drivers to have a good deal of experience driving similar vehicles. While there are many possible race series that can be your path to Formula 1, all racers must go through one or more of the junior levels to move up., Formula 1 racers must all be a minimum age to hold a license. Some younger racers are good enough to be considered for Formula 1, but will not be eligible until they reach the proper age. If you are still too young, look at gaining some more experience in any of the junior single seater race series to add to your race points.
 These points are acquired based on performance and placement in junior race series events. 40 points must be acquired over a 3-year period to be eligible to get your Formula 1 license.
 To be eligible to hold the racing license you need to have a good handle on driving the car. These hours can be logged doing practice laps or test drives for car manufacturers.

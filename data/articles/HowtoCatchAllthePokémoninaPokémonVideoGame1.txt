 Knowing what kind of Pokémon you are trying to catch will help you determine what items to bring along, which Pokémon you want on your team, and what kind of strategy to use.;
, Low health targets might require you to bring a lower level team. For powerful or legendary targets, you might need to bring along your most powerful Pokémon.


In normal game play, it's effective to use strong types against weak types, like a fire type against a grass type. Since you can't catch a Pokémon if it faints, you might want to choose a Pokémon the same type as your target.
 No collector can call himself a master if he doesn’t have the right tools for the job! Master Pokémon hunters like yourself will need the right pokéball to catch your prey.These can be found at the Pokémart or Pokémon Center. Each new version of the Pokémon game adds new features, but the main Pokéballs you should be familiar with are:Standard Pokéball
Great Ball
Ultra Ball
Master Ball
Safari Ball

, The most common way of acquiring new Pokémon is through randomly generated battles that occur when moving your character through certain areas. The most common places to randomly encounter a Pokémon are:Tall grass
Water (using the Surf ability)
Caves
Fishing

, A random encounter will pit your team of Pokémon against a wild one. Wild Pokémon are more resistant to capture when at full health, you should weaken your prey before attempting to throw a pokéball.


If your target still refuses to be caught, try a status effect, like sleep or paralysis, to improve your chances.
 Some ultra-rare Pokémon can take hours of random encounters before you finally find the one you’re looking for.


This activity, sometimes called “grinding,” might be more enjoyable for you listening to your favorite music, an audio book, or a movie.

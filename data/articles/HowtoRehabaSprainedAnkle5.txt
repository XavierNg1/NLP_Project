 Ask your doctor or physical therapist when it’s safe to go back to being physical, especially to the activity during which you injured your ankle. Going back to activities too soon is very risky – you can easily hurt your ankle again and cause lifelong issues., If you injured your ankle during a sport or activity, protect yourself from injuring it again. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist about this. They may suggest that you wear a brace or a wrap to protect your ankle joint., Your ankle may never be quite as strong as it was before your injury. To prevent re-injury, continue to do your calf and heel stretching and your strengthening exercises 3-4 days a week indefinitely.

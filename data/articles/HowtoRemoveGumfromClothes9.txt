 Goof off is a heavy-duty stain and spot remover that works well on gum. It's available at most hardware stores.


There is a product called Goo Gone that also works very well and washes easily out of clothing. You can get it at most grocery, drug, or department stores, or online.
 Alternately, use a similar, but unwanted, fabric to check whether Goof Off removes color.
 Immediately scrape with a butter knife.
 You may have to squirt a little more Goof Off onto the gum residue in order to remove completely.

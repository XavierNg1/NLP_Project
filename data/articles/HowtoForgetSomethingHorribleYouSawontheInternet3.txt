 Leave the Internet behind for a while, and try to immerse yourself in the world around you. Catch up with some friends, or go for a run, or go spend time in nature. Fix your mind in the present moment, and do something you love. The horrible thing that you saw online may seem much more abstract once you've stepped away from the keyboard and involved yourself in more relevant things.
 The Internet projects the dark depths and the soaring heights of the human condition. It is a maze of code, and each click is a step around an unknown corner. You might encounter something beautiful that inspires you to change your life â€“ or you might come across something utterly soul-crushing.


Think before you click. Try to be aware of the context of each click that you make, and ask yourself whether you trust the source that provided the link. Do your best to figure out what you're going to see when you click the link. Ask yourself whether that's something that you want in your head.
 If you came across something illegal and obviously harmful, consider reporting it to your local police station. It can be hard to track down Internet criminals, but it's been done before. Think about examples of situations that might beg further action:


Someone posted photos of a dog that had been horribly abused. The photos were posted to a local forum, and you think there's a good chance that the poster was physically abusing this dog in your area.
Someone posted child pornography or other evidence of child abuse. Not only is this activity illegal, but it is harmful to children. For all you know, a child's life could be at stake.

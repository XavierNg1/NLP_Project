 Only use vacuums that can handle wet and dry materials, like a chipper vacuum or a wet/dry shop vacuum. Position the vacuum where you plan to start cleaning your gutters. Insert the longest hose into the vacuum and fasten the longest rigid extension attachment to the hose.The power cord for your vacuum may not be long enough to reach a power outlet. Use an extension cord to supply your vacuum with power in these cases.
Choose a vacuum that has a strong motor for this project. Vacuums with weak suction will not be as effective., Measure the total length of the rigid extension attachment. When measuring gutter height, measure from the top of the gutter to about knee height. Subtract the attachment length from the gutter height. This measurement is the total length of your secondary extension.


While using the gutter vacuum, you’ll likely hold the attachment at about chest height. Measuring the gutter from its top to the ground will likely result in a gutter vacuum that is longer than necessary, making it more unwieldy.
 Mark the secondary extension measurement (gutter height – attachment length) on the rigid plastic tube or pipe. Use a hacksaw to cut the plastic to secondary extension length. Excess tube/pipe can be reused or thrown away.Cutting your tube/pipe may have left behind burrs. These can cause slivers or cuts. Remove burrs with a file when necessary.
 Join these pieces together firmly with aluminum tape. Do the same at the opposite end of the secondary extension with a duct elbow. When the first elbow is in place, similarly add the second elbow to it.Putting these pieces together will result in a long, straight, rigid extension that ends in a hook. The hook formed by the elbows should curve so it is facing roughly downwards.
Be sure to tape the connections of your homemade gutter vacuum thoroughly. Gaps may cause suction to decrease, making the vacuum less effective.

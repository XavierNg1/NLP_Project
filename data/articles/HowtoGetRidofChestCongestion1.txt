 Chest congestion is the result of excess mucus and other fluids in your lungs. It is generally caused by: the common cold, which is a viral infection in your respiratory tract; complications of the common cold like viral acute bronchitis, bacterial bronchitis and bacterial or viral sinusitis;chronic bronchitis, which is typically the result of smoking;nasal polyps, which are noncancerous growths in your nasal passage; allergies; hay fever; environmental irritants; or the flu.


Often nasal congestion leads to chest congestion.;
, If your congestion is caused by the common cold, it will usually clear up on its own in about one week without the use of prescription medicine. Most are viral infections, which can’t be treated with antibiotics. If it doesn’t improve after a week, you should make an appointment to see your physician. Viral infections can become bacterial and generally require treatment with an antibiotic.It's very important to also consult with a physician after a week if you have asthma or a weakened immune system., Set up an appointment if your congestion is accompanied by wheezing, or if you have a high fever lasting more than 3 days, experience bloody discharge from your nose or from your mouth when coughing, or have green nasal discharge with pain and a fever.


While some of these could be the result of a bacterial infection, they could also be indicators of something more serious., Coughing is common with chest congestion. And you don’t want to suppress a wet or "productive cough" that produces phlegm or mucus unless it’s severely impairing your breathing or sleep. Productive coughs helps clear your lungs and lower respiratory tract. Avoid cough suppressants unless your cough is extreme and preventing you from sleeping or breathing.If you're still coughing after 4 weeks, however, schedule an appointment to determine and treat the underlying cause.

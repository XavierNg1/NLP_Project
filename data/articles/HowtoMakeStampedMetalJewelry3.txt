 After you have added letters and symbols to your metal piece, you may decide to flatten out the shape a bit more or you may want to texturize it using a special hammer. Before you do either of these things, tape your metal piece to your stamping pad.


Use a couple of strips of masking tape to hold the metal in place.
If you need to see the edges of your piece, then you can also tape down just one edge, or you can use an object like a clothespin or pencil (eraser end) to hold the piece while you hammer it with your other hand., To flatten out a piece after you have finished adding letters and shapes, secure the piece in place and then hit the piece with the flat edge of a hammer. Start on one side and work around the piece until the shape looks how you want it to look.


Flattening a piece after it has been warped may test your patience, but try not to rush if you get frustrated or you may damage the metal.
 If you want to add texture to a metal tag after you have added letters and/or symbols, then you can use a special texturizing hammer to do this. If you have a ball peen hammer, then try using the ball peen to create a bumpy texture. A riveting hammer can also create some interesting texture.Even if you do not have a special hammer, you can use letter stamps to create texture in your metal. Try using X’s and O’s to texturize your piece, or experiment with other letters and shapes for texture.
Hit the metal with your hammer in different places and with different levels of force. Do this all over the metal to create a textured look.
 After you have finished designing your metal piece, you can add a necklace or bracelet chain, or attach it to an earring base to make it wearable. Use pliers and a jump ring or two to attach your piece to a chain or earring base.


If you blanks are not pre-punched, then you will need a metal punching tool to punch holes in them. You can find these in craft stores.Your piece is ready to wear, or to give someone as a unique gift.

 Remember that preventive care is less expensive than treating a life-threatening disease. Do your best to schedule and keep your dog’s vet exams, keep up with vaccinations, monitor parasites, and maintain other elements of canine healthcare.For example, vaccinating your dog against a digestive disease, even if the vaccine isn't mandatory, is much less expensive than providing treatment if your dog gets sick.
Monitoring your dog for parasites and providing preventive medication will cost less in the long run than caring for a dog with heartworm.
 Maintaining your dog’s hygiene and grooming will reduce the risk of illness, which will help cut its overall healthcare costs.Brush your dog’s teeth two to three times a week, or more if their breed is at higher risk of dental issues. Use gauze or a cloth, water, and toothpaste for dogs. Don’t use toothpaste that’s meant for people on your dog.

Trim your dog’s nails if you start to hear clicking when it walks. Nails that are too long interfere with its gait and is harmful to its ankle and knee joints.
If your dog has skin folds, clean them out weekly to prevent irritation and infection. Use warm water and a cloth to wipe away any buildup, then towel dry thoroughly.
 If you’re having trouble affording preventive care for your dog, there are plenty of organizations that can offer help. If you live in the United States, you can search the American Humane Society’s resource list, which offers dozens of national and state organizations.Look online for breed-specific financial aid groups, or contact your local breed club and ask about assistance options.
You can also get in touch with your local animal shelter and ask about other financial aid options in your particular area if preventive care becomes unaffordable.
Pet insurance can also make preventive care more affordable and help with costly treatments if your dog gets sick or injured.

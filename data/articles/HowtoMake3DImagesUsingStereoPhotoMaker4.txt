 The program will guide you, asking where it can find the left image, and then where it can find the right image. After you've selected the images, both will appear side by side.
 It takes you to a window that displays both images semi-transparently. You can then drag one until it lines up well with the other.


Ideally you want to make the two images match up perfectly vertically, and match up horizontally for things in the very center of the picture. Line up the two images as well as you can and click OK.
 The multicolored icon to the left of the vertical red-blue icon is there to see your image as an anaglyph. Now that you've aligned them, click on that and put on your 3D glasses. To get a big view, click on the icon that looks like a rectangle with an X through it . That will give you a full screen view. After you've had a good enough look at it, to go back to the regular program screen, hit the Esc key. Make any adjustments in aligning the images until you're happy with it.
 Choose File, Save Stereo Image.
 You may want to change the name to that it doesn't have a -L or -R on it.
 Again, choose File, Open Left/Right Images, and tell the program which files to open. Then select Adjust, Auto-Align . If it ever asks if you want to use previous report files, always click No. The program will perform its magic comparing the two images and lining them up as perfectly as it can. If you want you can save this image also, perhaps with another name. You can later look at the two images and see how they compare.

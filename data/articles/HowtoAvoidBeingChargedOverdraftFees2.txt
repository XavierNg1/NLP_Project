 It's tempting to accept the "available balance" shown on your ATM receipt. However, that figure does not reflect checks that haven't yet been presented for payment ("outstanding" checks) or bank card purchases that haven't been processed yet. You may also have some automatic payments that will occur within the next few days.
 The best way to ascertain your available balance is to keep your check register up to date. Immediately record every transaction so that you have an accurate record of checks that will soon be presented for payment. That will let you know how much money you have available.


Find out if your bank or credit union has an app to help you maintain your check register. Check with your bank about online services. Many banks offer a portfolio of services to help their customers manage money.
If you prefer managing your register on paper, do it consistently so that you know that your available balance is accurate.
 A pending overdraft fee may indicate that you haven't balanced your checkbook lately. Do this regularly in search of arithmetical errors or failure to record transactions.
 If you occasionally make bank card purchases, be sure to note them in your register. Such purchases, like checks, often take a few days to clear.
 It's best to wait a day or two before drawing on those deposits. (The bank can tell you when those funds will be available for use.)

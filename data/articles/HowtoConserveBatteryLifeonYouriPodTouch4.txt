 "Settings" is the grey gear icon--it should be on your iPod's home screen.
 You can turn off your wifi or disable certain wifi settings from this menu.
 When this option is enabled, your phone constantly searches for nearby wifi networks. Turning it off will save you some battery life.
 Using wifi rather than data is easier on your battery, and you'll likely have faster upload and download speeds.
 Your iPod's Network Searching feature should now be disabled!

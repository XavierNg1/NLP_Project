 Cut the top off of the pumpkin. Scoop out all the seeds with an ice cream scoop.;
, Cut the pump in half, bake with sliced sides down in a shallow pan at 375 degrees for 1.5 hours, or microwave on high for 7 minutes per pound. You can also cut up into cubes and boil - this makes it unnecessary to peel a raw pumpkin - a very difficult process.
 Scoop out cooked pumpkin.Throw them into the blender with the milk, apple cider, and other spices and ingredients for more taste.
 Pour yourself a cup, curl up next to your fireplace (or at least a fireplace screen saver), and enjoy!

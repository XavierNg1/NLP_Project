 Make sure that you have the proper equipment. An adequate machine should be capable of heating water to desired brew temperatures (approx 192-200ºF, or 90-96ºC) and be capable of delivering the water at least 9BAR (~130PSI) in a consistent manner. For those on a budget, Coffeekid.com recommends the Rancilio Betsy, Saeco Classico, or Gaggia Coffee.

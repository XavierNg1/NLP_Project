 Place them on a flat work surface, like a countertop or the bed. Position the boxers so that the waistband is pointing away from you. Smooth out any wrinkles with your hands., Take the right half of the boxers and fold them to the left, so that the outer seams are aligned.
 Now, the waistband is pointing to your left and the leg holes are pointing to your right.
 This will create a long rectangle shape.
 Bring the waistband to meet the bottom edge. The boxers are now folded and ready to stack.

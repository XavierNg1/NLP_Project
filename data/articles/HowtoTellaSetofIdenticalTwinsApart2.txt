 Identical twins often have different personalities. If you've known a pair of twins for awhile, you may be able to tell them apart based on personality. For example, Alice may be very shy and withdrawn, while Sophie is a social butterfly. If you see one of the twins out walking, and she smiles and yells, "Hi!", you're likely dealing with Sophie.
 Twins may have a different speaking style. You can use this as a means to identify twins. Returning to the above example, as Sophie is more social, she may use common slang and colloquial terms in conversation. As Alice is more withdrawn, and spends a lot of time at home, she may have not picked up on as much slang. She may be unlikely to use certain terms and phrases in conversation, sticking to more formal sentences.
 Twins may also have slightly different mannerisms and habits, which you may pick up on if you've spent a lot of time with the twins. One twin may have a habit of twirling his hair, for example, while another may bite his fingernails. One twin may gesticulate more when he or she talks, while another may be more reserved in conversation.
 It's okay to ask politely. While twins may sometimes get slightly annoyed, many identical twins understand others have trouble differentiating between them. If you're really in doubt, politely say something like, "I'm sorry, but are you Mason or Todd?" Thank the twin for answering, and let him or her know you'll try to do better in the future.

 Always shave after or during a shower or bath, regardless of the part of your body you’re shaving. Warm water weakens hair structure and raises it from the skin, making shaving less irritating. In addition, always apply a shaving cream or gel before shaving to lubricate your skin.Avoid shaving with just soap and water.
 After applying shaving cream or gel, wait a minute or so before you start to shave. This will allow the cream or gel to reach the base of each hair shaft. That way, each individual hair will be slightly raised, your skin will be moisturized, and your razor will be less likely to cause irritation or ingrown hairs., Avoid shaving with dull blades. Change your razor every three to six uses, or more frequently if necessary. Check the razor's lubricating strip before you start shaving, and use a new one if it's worn or whenever a razor feels dull when you start to shave., No matter where you’re shaving, also go in the direction that your hair grows. Shaving against the grain pulls hair, causes irritation, and can cut the skin. Be gentle, proceed slowly, and avoid applying too much pressure on your razor.Rinse the razor with hot water after every couple strokes to prevent too much hair from collecting between the blades.
 When you’ve finished shaving, you should wash your freshly shaved skin using a gentle cleanser. Rinse the area with cool water and dab dry with a towel after cleansing.Avoid skin cleansers that contain alcohol. If you want to go with a natural cleanser, consider applying witch hazel or tea tree oil to freshly shaved skin.   

, Moisturizing after shaving helps your skin recover and helps prevents irritation. Rub a small amount of moisturizer over the area, and try not to over-moisturize. Leaving too much residue behind can block pores and weigh down individual hair shafts, which leads to ingrown hairs.

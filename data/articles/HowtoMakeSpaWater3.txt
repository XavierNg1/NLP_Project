 In a large pitcher that holds approximately 2 to 2 ½ quarts (1.9 to 2.4 l), combine 6 cups (1.4 l) of water, 12 thin cucumber slices, 4 thin lemon slices, 4 sprigs of fresh mint that have been slightly crushed, and 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary that have been slightly crushed. Use a wooden spoon to stir the ingredients until well mixed.You can use whatever herbs that you prefer. Some other options to consider include thyme, basil, cilantro, and/or parsley.
 Once all of the ingredients are combined in the pitcher, cover it with the lid or a piece of plastic wrap. Place the pitcher in the refrigerator, and allow the water to chill for at least 2 hours or up to 8 hours.The longer that you allow the water to chill, the stronger the water’s herb flavor will be.
 After you’ve chilled the water for several hours, add enough ice to the pitcher to fill it. Pour the spa water into glasses, and serve.

 If you can't find one, then buy some clips to fit over the bottom/horizontal bar of a regular hanger. You can also use large binger clips or clothespins as well. These hangers are suitable for most types of pants, but they may leave some imprints in leather or pleather pants unless you use cushioning (such as index cards).
 If your pants are too wide for your hanger, fold them in half vertically. If you do not have a lot of vertical space in your closet, fold your pants in half vertically, then horizontally. You will be clipping them by the knee part.
 Each clip should be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the outside edge of the waistband. The clips on most hangers are adjustable. They can slide across the bar back and forth. Move the clips around as necessary.
 Many pant clips have little grooves or teeth on them. These can leave marks and imprints in soft fabrics, such as leather and pleather. Find four index cards and place two inside each pant clip. Place the fabric between the cards. The cards will cushion the fabric, and protect it from the teeth.You can also use business cards, playing cards, or even pieces of cardstock.
 Consider hanging them so that the curved part of the hook is facing you.

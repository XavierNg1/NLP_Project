 Jimi Hendrix made feedback popular by playing his guitar in front of his amp.This is actually the main way that feedback can be produced when you play music, so make sure that your instrument or microphone is not picking up the noise from your amplifier.


Even though your amplifier may not have a direct line to your input, it’s still possible that sound-waves are bouncing off reflective surfaces. Move things like tables and chairs to eliminate reflective surfaces that may be bouncing sound back into your input.
 Pointing your amp towards the wall may stifle the sound but it will also prevent any feedback. Because sound-waves won’t be directly playing into your input, it’s unlikely that you will get feedback.


Pick up or roll your amplifier towards a wall and leave around 2-3 inches from the amp and the wall.
Putting your amp on a carpet instead of a hardwood floor will reduce reverberations throughout the house.
 Even if you're not pointing your instrument or microphone directly into the amplifier, your inputs could still be picking up sound waves produced by amp. If you have a long enough cord, move further away from the amp.


Put the amplifier in front of you, pointing outwards. This will also help you if you are on stage and are experiencing a lot of feedback.
Buying a longer cord will allow you the freedom to move around while you are playing.

 You can either cut the chain from an old chain necklace or even recycle an old charm bracelet. If you prefer, you can buy a length of jewelry chain at a craft store., There's no reason to attach another claw to the other end of the chain. You can simply fasten the bracelet by grabbing the end of the chain with the lobster claw., Using needle-nosed or jewelry pliers, attach jump rings to any charms or beads you plan to hang on the bracelet. Be sure to attach the jump rings so the charms will all hang on the same side of the chain and face the same direction.

 Coming out with your sexuality will relieve you of a burden. It is a lot harder for you to meet others if no one knows your situation. Coming out conveys your confidence, and for many this is attractive.


This can be an incredibly difficult task for some. Seek out a close friend who knows the truth and ask for their support.
Some conservative families do not support this, and it can be painful. Consider coming out to a select group before talking to your family, if you're in this scenario.
Always consider if it will be more harmful than helpful.;
, It is easier to track down someone who has already come out as opposed to searching through a haystack. Even if you don't want a relationship, getting to know this person could help introduce you to others.
 Start a gay/straight alliance at your school or join the current chapter. Find some other type of organization that you know is friendly like art or theater.


Find a guy that you can hang around comfortably without seeming "clingy". Make him your friend, and hang out a lot.
 Make sure that you want to go through with this. Sometimes, people make decisions that they haven't thought through and it hurts them in the long run. Make sure you're ready for a relationship.


Don't rush into a relationship for the sake of a relationship.
Don't only want sex with your relationship partner this will make it a very rocky relationship if there is just sex.
 If there is an older LGBT person you know, consult them for advice. You'll be surprised how much reassurance they can instill by telling their struggles as a youth.Many counselling services in schools have a faculty member who specializes in this type of advice.

 Some clocks are marked by roman numerals, so learn roman numerals one to 12. An "I" is counted as one, a "V" is counted as 5, and "X" is counted as 10. If a symbol appears before another symbol, it's subtracted from the value. If a symbol appears after another symbol, it's added to the value.One to three are simply written as "I, II, III." Four is written as "IV." The "I" subtracts one from the "V" (which symbolizes 5), adding up to four.
Five is then marked by a "V" and the numbers leading up to 10 are marked by adding "I" symbols. The number "VI" is six, "VII" is seven, and so on.
Ten is marked by an "X." Eleven and 12 are marked by adding to the "X." Eleven is written as "XI" and 12 is written as "XII."

, Not all clocks have numbers. They may have symbols marking the hours instead. Starting at the top of the clock, mentally mark this as twelve. Then, move to the right and count "1, 2, 3, 4..." and so on. This will help you determine which hour each symbol marks., Some digital clocks are written in military time but, luckily, this is easy to convert. From one AM to noon, military time is the same as civilian time. After noon, you have to do some work to determine time.Numbers lower "10" are marked by placing a zero in front of them. Nine o'clock PM, for example, is written as "0900."
Subtract "1200" from the time to determine times that do not start with a zero. For example, 1300 subtracted from 1200 is 100. In military time, therefore, 1300 hours is one o'clock PM.

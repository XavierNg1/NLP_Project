 10 is a good number for a single serving, but more is always welcome. You could always double the batch for later! Grab your cutting board and knife and see where the moment takes you.
 Water will do the job and highlight the sweet strawberry-ness of your drink, but juice will get it more pizzazz -- apple, pineapple, mango, heck, even grape or cranberry. It'll drive down the strawberry flavor, but it'll give your smoothie or more complicated, sharp twist.
 Honey is mother nature's sugar, but the white stuff will do the trick, too. However, both are optional! If your strawberries are sweet enough, your smoothie may not need it.


You can always blend everything else up and then see if your smoothie needs sugar. An excuse for a preemptive spoonful, really.
 The smaller they are, the easier it'll be on your blender, but they'll eventually get decimated all the same. If you're wary of adding too much ice, try adding half now to be blended and then adding 1 or 2 whole to your drink at the end to keep it chilly.


Another good alternative is a chilled glass -- that way the glass acts as the ice and your smoothie stays a thicker, more filling consistency.
 The ice gets pummeled on the low setting, but it all smoothie-fies on high. You'll know it's done when everything is a red fruity liquid. Grab a spoon -- how's it taste?


Then you may want to blend it on high for another 30 seconds to aerate. This will give it a bit of volume, too (read: more bang for your smoothie buck).
 Garnish with a wedge of fruit -- maybe lemon, lime, pineapple, or more strawberry? A straw and an umbrella, too! Ah, fruity goodness. Have fun making and drinking!

 Form a cup so that the air you breathe out through your mouth has nowhere to go but into your nose. Breathe out, slowly, from your mouth, and quickly inhale the hot breath through your nose. If your breath is especially rank, you may be able to tell â€“ but the air can quickly escape through the cracks between your fingers, and it's difficult to get a precise diagnosis using this method.It is, however, one of the most discreet ways to check for bad breath in public.
 Take a deep breath, and then hold the cup so that it covers both your nose and your mouth, with minimal ventilation, so you can get a close to accurate answer. Breathe out through your mouth, slowly, filling the cup with hot breath. Inhale quickly and deeply through your nose--you should be able to smell your breath.


This step may be slightly more accurate than merely cupping your hands around your nose and mouth, but its accuracy is heavily dependent upon how tightly the cup seals in your breath.
You can try this out with any container that traps your breath in a circuit between your nose and your mouth: a small paper or plastic bag, a tight-fitting surgical mask, or any manner of air-retentive face-mask.
Be sure to rinse out the cup before breathing into it again. Wash it with soap and water before storing it or using it for anything else.
 Avoid trying these methods directly after you've brushed your teeth, swished with mouthwash, or eaten something minty. These things may make your breath smell better, but the way your breath smells immediately after brushing your teeth is not necessarily the way that it smells most of the time. Try smelling your breath at various times--right after brushing your teeth, but also in the middle of the day, when you're most likely to encounter people--to better understand the difference. Bear in mind that your breath may smell bad after eating a spiced meal

 Golden Retrievers are smart dogs who can be trained. However, they won’t be trained overnight. Keep your expectations reasonable as you train your dog. Understand that it may take them awhile to learn the command, but with persistence and having them repeat the action over and over, they will learn it.


Stay calm. Getting upset doesn’t build trust between you and your Golden Retriever. Getting mad also can upset your dog, causing them to act out.
 Positive reinforcement is one of the most effective ways to train your Golden Retriever. Dogs respond well to treats or praise when they do an action, and they naturally want to do the same thing again. This helps you show your dog what behavior you desire, and they know they will receive some sort of positive reward for complying.Ignore unwanted behaviors. If you respond, this is reinforcing them by giving them attention. Ignoring the behaviors shows that the dog won’t get a reaction from you, so there is no reason to do them.
 You can use a variety of treats with your dog. Make sure they are small enough that they don’t have to take a long time eating it. At the same time, use verbal praise, like saying, “Good job!”. You may also pet the dog or give them physical attention.Make sure to provide the reward immediately after the action. Don’t wait until later. The dog has to know that the treat comes from that behavior.

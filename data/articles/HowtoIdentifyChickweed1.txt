 The leaves for common chickweed begin as small ovals with a pointed tip. As the plant matures, the leaves grow larger and begin to ruffle slightly. The ruffles form around the edge of the oval and looks like a different shape.;
, One characteristic detail of the chickweed’s stem is the direction of the hair. If you examine the stalk’s hair, you’ll notice that the hairs change position at each node. The node is the knot-like location where the leaves extend out of the stalk., Another characteristic feature of the common chickweed is the inner-core, underneath the stalk. You can reveal the inner-core by pulling the stem of the plant. The inner-core happens because plant develops multiple stalks from the same root system.This is also the reason that a mature plant will sprawl.
 Chickweed grows in a sprawling fashion. It has a weak stem and each side of the stem has a single line of hairs. Younger plants won’t sprawl quite as fully as a matured plant. Instead of looking for a tall plant, seek out a flat sprawling plant.


Since there are so many stalks coming from the root system, many weaker plants will become engulfed by chickweed. This is the reason why many lawn owners dislike chickweed.
 These appear in the spring and summer time. Each flower has five petals and the deep notching on the flowers makes it appear like 10 petals.

 Be sure to choose a reasonable size.;
, More commonly known as CAS

, Be sure to have everyone look exactly the way you want them to.
 Move your family into the empty lot you recently put in. They will have enough simoleons to afford the lot unless you used cheats to lower their family funds.
, Throw in some paintings and decorations, too, because what's a house without a house, anyway?

, Put in the fences that Sims can walk over and add a garden. Put some swings in the backyard (since Sims love swings! Which Sim doesn't?) and maybe a grill and a table with chairs to eat outside. Flooring is okay outside! It adds in a touch of modern lifestyle!

, Custom content that Sims wear is fine, but custom content for the lot isn't okay, because of the creator's policy and, when others download the lot, the custom content is most likely going to flash blue. That's a sign that they don't have the mesh for the custom content included.
 Make sure these neighbors are ones that were included with the neighborhood, and not ones you made or ones that are custom/made by others from different computers.
 Make sure they all have at least a few skill points for whichever categories you want!

, The Pleasant's story. The Broke's story. Just a couple families' stories you can compare to. If your story has conflicts like other families have, then you're good to go! Be sure to check if your family has some good events/happenings in life. Maybe throw in a "surprise" that causes a female adult to walk oddly and have a large stomach.
 If you do desire to share your family, your family's story, and your family's lot, you can! Upload the occupied lot to the Exchange, and include a description like the ones that Maxis-created families have. Add a life-related question at the end, such as, "Will Taylor ever be able to improve her love life?" or, "But will anything cut between the family and cause mix-ups?" Make sure it fits how you made your story.

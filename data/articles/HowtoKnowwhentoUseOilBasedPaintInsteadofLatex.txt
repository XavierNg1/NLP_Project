 Alkyd paint is best used for cabinetry, exterior trim, interior trim, doors, kitchens, high-moisture bathrooms, and anywhere a rich, semi-gloss or full gloss look is desired.;
, Most of the time, homeowners will use a brushed finish for a traditional painted look. This requires a high quality china bristle brush (the kind with the black bristles), or a synthetic brush that is advertised for oil-based finishes and paints. For most job a simple 2" or 2 1/2" cut-in (i.e., diagonal bristle) brush will work, but if you will be painting window mullions you will want a smaller 1" sash brush. A small paint can that is comfortable to hold is helpful, because you don't want to be dipping the brush into the can that the paint comes in (to avoid contamination with dirt, hair, loose bristles, etc). And a couple of jars for cleaning up with mineral spirits (AKA paint thinner) and for re-using the old mineral spirits. For most homeowner jobs, a pint of mineral spirits will suffice for clean-up.
 Most paint stores sell oil-based paints, but some of the big box home centers don't because it isn't as familiar with the DIY market. Sometimes alkyd enamel is sold under the heading of "industrial rust preventative" or some such wording, but it is the same stuff.
 As with latex, two coats over a primer is standard. The primer can be oil or water based primer, but if the paint color is dark you should have the paint store tint the primer the approximate color of the paint.
 This will keep imperfections out of the final finish.

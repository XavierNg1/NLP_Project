 Seeing a doctor may be necessary if you have tight foreskin that you cannot loosen even after working through your stretches. Most doctors will refer you to a urologist, who will examine you and suggest a treatment for your specific condition.Phimosis can lead to other complications that need medical attention. These complications include irritation, bleeding, difficult or painful urination, ballooning of the foreskin, or urinary tract infections.
 Your doctor can prescribe a topical corticosteroid ointment. This ointment softens the tissue of the foreskin, which helps the foreskin retract more easily.The ointment is used twice each day for around eight weeks, along with manual stretching and retraction.
The doctor will show you how to properly use the ointment.
 Circumcision is when the foreskin is removed medically. This is not a common treatment for phimosis, but in rare cases it may be the proper treatment. This generally is only recommended if the ointment and stretching doesnâ€™t work, if the foreskin is stuck, if there are recurring infections, or if there are other physical problems.

 Place the ice in your blender and blend it on high to get rid of any large chunks of ice and to make the frozen pi√±a colada smooth.
 Add 3 oz. of coconut cream, 6 oz. of pineapple juice, 1.5 oz of heavy cream, and 2 oz. of rum to the blender.
 Blend them until the ingredients are blended into a thick frozen mixture.
 Any glass will work, though a hurricane glass or a tall glass will make for a better presentation.
 Cut halfway into the cherry and place it on the rim of the glass.
 This frozen drink will taste the best if you sip it through a straw.
 Enjoy this tasty drink any time.

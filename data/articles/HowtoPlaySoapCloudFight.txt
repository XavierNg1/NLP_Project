 Every team should have at least two people, one will be you and the other will be your assistant. Another one-the referee will stand in the between. Totally, five people will be there.;
, Have two bars of soap, two loofahs, two water sprays, a tub of water and two mugs. For protective clothing, try out swimsuits and goggles. Don't be naked!

, Don't do this indoors unless it's in the bathroom. It's best and safest played outdoors.
 Grab some soap and your loofah. Form soap clouds by rubbing the loofah with the soap, then squeezing the loofah. This causes it to form soap clouds.
 The one who hits a person with the soap cloud wins a point.
 Sprays and tubs of water can be used to break soap clouds, but only so many times. Basically, you can use any of them thrice for every level (and if used, they need to be refilled at each new level). Thus, in total, you can use all of them twelve times throughout an entire game (together, if you used the tub twice and the spray once, that counts for three times). Use these bonus items for breaking the clouds only, not for shooting the players.
 There are supposed to be three levels, two short and the final level is the longest. The first two levels should go for five minutes, while the final level should be for double that time. However, you can change the rules if wished.


The assistant must keep supplying soap clouds and the water sprays.
 When time out occurs, the referee will notify you.
 Don't stay out there for too long!

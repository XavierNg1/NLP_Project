 If you can't get rid of certain toolbars, or are getting lots of pop-ups, you may have an adware infection. Download AdwCleaner and Malwarebytes Antimalware to scan for and remove any infections. Both of these programs are free.


See Remove Malware for a more detailed guide on cleaning adware infections.

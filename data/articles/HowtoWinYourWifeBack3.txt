 You don’t want to risk pushing your wife further away by being too aggressive or desperate while trying to win back her love.Similarly, you don’t want to let yourself become overly vulnerable, constantly complain, or let yourself go – none of these developments will help you win your wife back.


Remind yourself that her attitude towards you depends on your current behavior.
Calmness is both more mature and more attractive than any behavior that might qualify as craziness.
Remove yourself from a conversation or location when you feel yourself begin to slip emotionally.
 If your wife won’t answer your calls, it’s easy to become worried – even frantic – especially when your marriage is struggling. It’s very hard to acclimate to a spouse actively keeping you at a distance, but remind yourself that you can’t control your wife’s behavior.After you’ve called once or twice and she hasn’t returned your calls, leave her a voicemail or text saying you’re hoping to hear back from her soon.
Quit calling and texting.
Try not to worry about what she is doing. Don’t allow yourself to imagine worst-case scenarios. Recognize that she may simply need some space.
 It may seem counterintuitive – and it may be hard to do – but giving your wife some space will give you both the time opportunity to think things over. Verbalize your intent by saying something like, “We both need time to think, and I respect that.”Demonstrate your confidence and independence by acknowledging the current distance between the two of you, and stepping back before doing anything that might make things worse.

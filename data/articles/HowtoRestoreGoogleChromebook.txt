Powerwash is the procedure used to clear all saved data and user settings from the Chromebook.
 A small window prompt will pop up telling you that you need to restart your device to continue with the reset. Just click on the “Restart” button on the screen to proceed.
 Once it restarts, a message will appear on the screen asking you to confirm your action. Click “Reset” on the message box and Chromebook will proceed with the Powerwash process.
 This will take only a few minutes. After the Powerwash process is complete, you’ll be able to use your Chromebook again.

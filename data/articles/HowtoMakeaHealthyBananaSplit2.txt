 Place the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave it for 30 seconds, then give it a stir. Continue to microwave it in 30 second intervals, stirring after each, until the chocolate is smooth and pourable.You can also melt the chocolate over low heat on the stovetop if you donâ€™t want to use the microwave.
 Place the bananas and about 3/4 of the walnuts in a medium-sized bowl. Mix them together with your clean hands or rubber spatula. You can use a metal spoon, but be careful not to break the bananas.Your bananas should be about 1/4 inch (or about 1/2 centimeter) in thickness.
 Grab four small bowls or parfait glasses. First, place 1/4 cup (60 mL) of pineapple at the bottom of each bowl. Then divide the walnut-coated bananas evenly between them. Top each with a scoop of strawberry ice cream, drizzle with melted chocolate, and top with the rest of the walnuts and a cherry.You can substitute the strawberry ice cream with a low-fat variety, high protein ice cream, or frozen yogurt for healthier options.

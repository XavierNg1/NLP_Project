 You can also download the We Heart It app, but this tutorial will specify how to create an account using a desktop.;
, This is a pink button in the top right-hand corner of the site.
 The options are either Facebook, Twitter, Google or Email. This article will show how to sign up with Email.
 This isn't your username and can be changed at any time, so don't worry too much.
In the 'Your page name' box, fill in your chosen username. If you want your We Heart It account to look really good, you should choose a theme that you'd like to use and make your username relate to that. It could be fashion, quotes, grunge, or anything you want!
Finally, fill in your email address and a password of your choosing. Do not tell anyone this password, and make it a strong one that is hard to guess. After doing this, click on the 'Sign up' button.
 Straight away, the website will prompt you to heart four images. Try to heart images that fit your theme by clicking on the tags at the side. If none of the tags are relevant to what you're looking for, shuffle them until you find some that suit you.
 This way, you'll have pictures you like in your feed.
 You have created your account. Continue using it by hearting images and following new users, and just having fun!

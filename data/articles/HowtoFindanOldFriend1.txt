 If your search ends up dragging on or producing unclear results, you'll be thankful for as much detail as possible. Try to remember your friend's hair color, height, maiden name, family members' names, and the names of all towns he lived in and places he worked for.;
, Ask them questions about when they've last seen them, talked to them, or any personal information like last known email addresses or phone numbers.


If you and your friend had a major falling-out, some of your contacts may not cooperate.
It's worth combing your address book to see if you have written down any connections to them that you have forgotten about.
 A simple search engine attempt often doesn't lead anywhere, but it's worth a try. Whether you're using Google or one of the more specialized services described later, it pays to know how to make your search more effective:


Search for nicknames as well, even if your friend didn't have one when you knew her. For instance, an "Elizabeth" might now go by "Beth," "Betty," or "Liza."
Search for just the first name, in case your friend's last name changed with marriage or divorce.
On search engines, enclose your friend's name in quotation marks, then add more information such as the school she went to, the city she lived in, or the business she worked for.
 If you see a face that may be your friend, follow the link to the website the image showed up on. Even if this doesn't lead to contact, you might find a more up-to-date photograph of your friend, which can help you identify him in later search results.

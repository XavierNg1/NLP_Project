When you get to the track meet, talk to your coach to figure out when you will need to check in. If you don't check in, they will scratch your name.
 Typically, the kids who qualify for states go in the first flight and then the other kids who may not have qualified go after.


At most meets, they will offer you approximately 10 minutes to warm up and get a couple throws in. This can be a huge help since you cannot practice anywhere else if you are at a crowded meet.


After your first throw, you will go back to the end of the line and wait for your final two throws.
You can enter the circle any way you want, but you must exit the circle off the back. If you don't, your distance will not be taken. This is called a fault.

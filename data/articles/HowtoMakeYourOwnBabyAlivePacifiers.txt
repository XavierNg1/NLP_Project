 If you can't find a small round disc of a suitable size for the pacifier back, you'll need to make one. It is suggested that you use something like a plastic lid off a coffee or hot chocolate can as this is strong yet flexible, and will be easy to cut. Draw a suitably sized circle on the lid, then cut it out with scissors.


Ask a responsible older person to assist with cutting if you're having trouble with this.;
, This will make it prettier and more interesting. This step is optional, you can leave the eraser clear if preferred.


Check that the eraser tip fits the doll's mouth. If not, you may need to whittle it a little with a craft knife to get the shape right. Ensure that a responsible older person does the cutting if this is needed.
Adding colored tape will potentially make the tip bigger, so bear this in mind before adding it. Test the fit again after adding the tape, and make adjustments as needed.
 You may need to hold the eraser in place upright, taking care not to touch the hot glue or gun end.
 Do not do this until you are certain that the eraser tip has dried firmly to the disc, as you don't want the eraser tip to fall off. Cut off the excess pipe cleaner that doesn't form part of the circle, then glue the pipe cleaner circle in place. This gives the impression of both dimension and a neat finish, as well as covering the glued base of the eraser tip.
 Glue the two ends to the center of the other side of the disc, in a loop shape. This forms the holder of the pacifier.
 Once fully dried, the pacifier can be used with the Baby Alive doll.

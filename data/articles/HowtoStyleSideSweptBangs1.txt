 Since you're only working with your bangs, you'll need to keep the rest of your hair out of the way while you're creating your side swept style. Use a comb to separate the rest of your hair from your bangs, then secure it away from your face using a hair clip or elastic band.

, You can style your bangs when you've just stepped out of the shower or use a spray bottle with water to wet them. Tie back the rest of your hair so you don't get it wet, then spray your bangs with water. Use a towel to pat away the extra moisture.
 Using a hotter setting on your hair dryer will result in shiny, straight hair. A lower setting will leave your bangs with more texture.
 When your bangs are dry, use the brush or a comb to comb through them and give them a little volume. If you'd like, apply a bit of mousse or anti-frizz serum to your hands and run it through your bangs.








Don't use too much serum on your bangs, since this could cause them to look greasy.
If you want your bangs to lie flat, rather than having volume, don't fluff them up.
 Use your fingers or the end of a comb to sweep the tips of your bangs to the side. Your bangs will look best if they're swept in the opposite direction of your part.

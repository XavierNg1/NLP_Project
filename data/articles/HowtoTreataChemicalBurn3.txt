 There are two different types of chemical burns. Some chemical burns are primarily alkali in nature, such as those coming from fertilizer solutions, drain and pipe cleaners, ammonia, and batteries. These are particularly hazardous.


Despite the reputation of acids, acidic burns, such as those caused by hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, are less toxic., There are two types of second degree burns. The first is superficial, which is characterized by redness and damage of the entire portion of the upper layer of skin as well as partial damage to the second layer the skin. The burn will blister and you will be in pain, which is a good sign. The superficial burn will be very red and may bleed. These will likely heal without any scar within two weeks.

You may also experience a deep second degree burn. With this burn, you destroy even more of the under layer of dermis. It will no longer be red but will appear white, which shows that there has been damage to your blood vessels that is impairing circulation. It will not hurt because the nerves are also damaged so you cannot feel pain. There may or may not be blisters. Healing will occur but it will take longer than 2 weeks and will likely scar.
If you have a deep second degree chemical burn over a joint, the scar could affect your ability to move the extremity it is connected to., Third degree burns are the worst and cause the most lasting damage. Burns this deep effect the upper and lower skin layers, just like the other burns, but extend down through to the subcutaneous tissue. Damage to this layer of tissue causes it to look like leather. This burn requires surgical management for healing.

You will likely undergo a debridement or have skin grafts.

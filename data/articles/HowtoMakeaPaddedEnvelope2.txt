 Choose an envelope that is the same size you wish to make your padded envelope. Hold the envelope against a paper grocery bag. Trace the envelope’s outline on the bag, including the flap. On the other side of the bag, trace the envelope’s outline without the flap. Add about one inch (2.54 cm) to the left, right, and bottom side of each outline.If you don’t have an old envelope, try tracing around an envelope-sized object, such as a book.
Another, albeit rougher, way to make an envelope is to wrap the paper bag around the object you’re sending. You can stuff the inside with plastic bags or bubble wrap., Trim out the shape of the envelope, including the extra inch added to the initial outline. You’ll end up with the two sides of your envelope., Find the grocery bag section without the flap. Hold it against bubble wrap. Use it as an outline to cut out two pieces of bubble wrap., Lay the grocery bag cuttings flat on the table. Cover them with an adhesive such as rubber cement. Do not put glue on the flap of the bigger cutting. Lay a piece of bubble wrap on each cutting and allow the glue to dry., A sewing machine makes this easier. Lay the envelope pieces on top of one another. On the three sides without the flap, apply a straight stitch to bind them. Afterwards, try going back over the sides with a zigzag stitch to give the binding strength.

If you don’t want to stitch, you can try cutting the grocery bag longer or the bubble wrap shorter. Use the rubber cement to glue the ends of the grocery bag together.

 Abdominal muscles separate during pregnancy to make room for your baby. These muscles may take a long time to reconnect properly and doing too many crunches can further exacerbate the separation causing a “pouch” appearance in that area.


Some exercises tone abdominal muscles that are safer after childbirth. These involve isolating and engaging the muscles of the abdomen and can be done while sitting or standing.
 It may not be feasible to exercise the recommended 30 minutes a day all at once, but this can be broken up into smaller increments through the day. Not only does this relieve the stress of finding time, but it will also help maintain energy levels and mental health through the day. Try doing 10 minutes of exercise at a time spread through the day. Each increment can focus on a different aspect, such as cardio or strength., Walking with your baby in a stroller is a great way to begin getting exercise. When you feel up to it, try walking with the baby in a sling or carrier for the extra weight resistance. You can also try yoga, stretching and dance exercises that can be done with your child.


If you are unsure how to work your baby into a fitness routine check the local gyms and health clubs for mommy and baby classes.
 Cardio is good for your heart and weight loss. It will burn more calories and give you extra energy. Strength training will help keep muscles in shape, burn extra glycogen and tone. Strength training also has long term positive effects on metabolism.

 Feeding is an important way to develop a dog’s loyalty. You can develop your role as a caretaker or caring parent by being the one who provides the food for your dog at specific times during the day. This is better than leaving your dog’s food in a bowl all day because your dog will come to rely on you and to see you as a provider.


You should also encourage other members of your family to feed the dog. The more people that feed your dog, the more people your dog will bond with.
 Make sure that you properly groom and exercise your dog. Combing and brushing your dog’s hair will build your dog's bond with you and your family members. In addition, giving your dog baths will also help you develop a close connection with the animal., Most dogs need a certain amount of exercise to stay healthy. However, some breeds need more exercise than others need and, without enough physical activity, can begin to develop behavioral problems.Make sure that you play with your dog regularly and get them the amount of exercise that they need.


Talk with your veterinarian to make sure that your dog is getting enough active time each day. The needs for different breeds vary greatly, so be sure to get your veterinarian’s opinion.

 If you do not know basic events such as how many times the club has won the FA Cup (12, most in British history!) and First Division/Premier League (13) then you will be made fun of a lot. Also learn the past players.;
, There are many, most of them are uploaded onto YouTube but a basic fan should at least know 'The world's greatest team'.
, If you do not know who people like Jack Wilshere, Arsene Wenger, and Danny Welbeck are, you would have a hard time being an Arsenal fan.
 If it's your local team then that's okay, but don't try supporting other teams especially if they're a rival one such as Liverpool, Tottenham, Manchester United and Chelsea.
,, Matches against Arsenal are called North-London Derbies (NLD)

, Wear it even when the weather's scorching hot.
 Most likely, Arsenal are in the FA Cup and UEFA Champions League.
, If you do, you will start supporting the player, not the team. You will keep wanting them to pass to.
 Arsenal are famous for huge players leaving the club. In fact, in just two seasons they have lost 3 players who basically were the ones who kept Arsenal the team they are. Deal with it.

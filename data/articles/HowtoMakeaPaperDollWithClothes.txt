 Then draw a person. No features such as eyes or hair yet... but make sure to have room for shoulder-length hair. Cut between the shoulder and the hair to make a spot to insert tabs (more about tabs later).
 Do the hair first: bangs, no bangs, make the hair any length you want that is shorter than shoulder length. Then draw in the eyes, mouth, nose, even makeup if you want.
 I suggest a bikini. Any color. Do skin too.
 Any color works best. You can do streaks in the hair, too.
, But first, make a wardrobe for your doll.
 Well, trace the shape you want the outfit to be in.
 Those are tabs.
 Cut carefully. If it's all a bit frustrating at first, just keep going, you'll figure it out.
 Something small like that.
 Enjoy!

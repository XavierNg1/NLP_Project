 First, straighten your back and roll your shoulders back and down to keep your core engaged. Raise your chin and fix your eyes at a spot directly in front of you, at eye-level. Then:Take a step forward with one leg so that ankle is directly below your knee, with your calf and upper thigh forming a right angle.
At the same time, let your hips sink to the floor, so that your other leg also forms a right angle as its knee nears the floor.
Support your weight with your forward heel as you use that leg to push yourself back into a standing position.
Repeat with your other leg for one rep.
Start small if you need to, adding sets and reps as you build strength, until you are able to do three sets of 20 reps.
For an extra challenge, hold weights at your side for added resistance.;
, Let your upper back rest against the wall. This is your starting position. From there:Let your hips sink until each leg's calf and thigh form a right angle.
Make sure that the back of your head, shoulders, and your whole upper back stay flush against the wall.
Divide your weight evenly between both feet and keep them flat on the floor, from toe to heel.
Hold that position for 30 seconds before pushing with your legs back into a standing position.
Do three sets of one rep each, working your way up to 45 seconds in your second rep and a whole minute in your third.
 Let your arms hang down along your sides, with your palms flat against the outside of your thighs. From this starting position:Jump into the air, spreading your feet apart and raising your legs to either side.
At the same time, raise your arms to either side and over your head.
As you come back down, lower your feet and arms back into starting position for one rep.
Aim to complete three sets of 50 jumping jacks each workout, starting with fewer or smaller sets if needed until you work up to that.

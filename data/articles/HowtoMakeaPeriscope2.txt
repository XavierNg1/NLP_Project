 Try to find a piece somewhere between 12" and 20", but be aware that the longer the pipe is, the smaller the image will be.You may also use two sections of slightly different sizes, so one fits snugly into the other. This lets you rotate the top of your periscope while using it, to keep a lookout all around you.


You can find PVC pipe at a hardware store or home improvement store.
 Place a curved elbow joint pipe over each end of the pipe to make a periscope shape. Have the two openings point in opposite directions if you want to look around corners or over obstacles.
 These mirrors must be small enough to insert each one into one end of the pipe. This may be easier with a circular mirror, which you may be able to find at craft stores or online.
 Use putty or strong double-sided tape to stick the mirror to the inside corner of the elbow joint with putty.Look through that elbow joint, at the mirror you just inserted. Adjust the mirror until you see the base of the pipe at the opposite end, or remove the opposite elbow joint and adjust until you can see straight through the pipe.
 Fix the mirror at the same 45ยบ angle, so light reflected off one mirror will bounce through the pipe, hit the second mirror, and emerge through the other opening.
 Adjust the mirrors until you can clearly see through the periscope. Once the image is clear, attach the mirrors more firmly with several layers of packing tape, or with a specialized glue such as PVC adhesive or plastic epoxy.

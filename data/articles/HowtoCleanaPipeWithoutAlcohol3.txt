 Removing the debris from pipes after smoking gets you a better smoke on next use as well as helping your pipe last longer. Proper cleaning removes the moisture you introduce while smoking. Also, for wood pipes, proper care helps you form an ash cake inside the bowl that protects the pipe from heat., Smokers keep a rotation of pipes. A rotation means you switch to a different pipe to use. You can use the same pipe again if you donâ€™t have many pipes, but the longer you leave a pipe alone, the more it is able to settle and dry, protecting it from damage and keeping it from tasting sour., Direct sunlight heats the pipe and can damage wood. Water also wears away the finish on wood. In addition, keeping a pipe loose in a pocket means it can be scratched by keys and coins or fall out and crack. Keep it safe in a pipe pouch or sock.

 There are a variety of feeders on the market: top feeders, bottom board feeders, and frame feeders.  


Use bottom board feeders when the weather is warmer (daytime temperatures  of 60+ degrees F)
Top and frame feeders can be used in slightly cooler weather, as the bees are not required to leave the hive.  
If you do not have a commercially-bought feeder, you could also use a "baggy feeder", which is simply a gallon ziplock bag, with a couple 1 inch slits slashed into it, that you can lay on top of the frames, in between the cluster and the inner cover (with the use of a spacer or shallow hive body).;
, For spring feeding, use a 1:1 ratio of sugar and water, for example, 6 cups of water to 6 cups of sugar. Heat the mixture on the stovetop until the sugar is completely dissolved. Make sure that the mixture does not boil, as boiled sugar has been shown to cause digestive problems for the bees.


This is a great time to add Honey B Healthy if you would like to give an extra health boost to your bees. The 1:1 ratio is also stimulates brood-rearing, so it is a great thing to feed to a recent split or caught swarm.
 For fall feeding, use a 2:1 ratio of sugar to water. The more concentrated sugar water will help the bees store the syrup faster for winter.
 Let the mixture cool, then add the sugar syrup to the feeder.
 Bees may go through a quart a day, so check often. When the honey flow begins, remove any feeders from the hive before you add the honey supers.

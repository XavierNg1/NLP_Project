 In newer machines, if it detects that nothing is going on for a few seconds, it will make noises and move stuff around to try to find the ball. Sometimes this will dislodge the ball.;
, If the the machine isn't programmed to do this, or it just doesn't work, try shaking the machine. On newer machines, shaking it too much causes it to tilt, which is where the lights go out and the machine basically shuts off, which is not what you want to have happen.
 If you don't own the machine, ask the attendant or owner to fix it.
 If you do own the machine, get the keys, and open the money drawer.


Inside the drawer there will be a flat metal bar hanging from the top. Move the bar to either side of the machine until something clicks. This should unlock the metal bar right above the drawer at the bottom of the playing field.
Take off the bar, and carefully slide the glass off the machine. It would help if you had two people doing this. Try to keep your fingers off the glass, as the oil from your hands will smudge it.
Dislodge the ball, using your hand or a utensil.
Slide the glass all the way up, replace the bar, turn the flat bar in the cabinet to the locked position, and lock up the cabinet.

 You may be carrying them around with you for hours, so store them in bubble wrap, cardboard, cloth, or whatever else works. As you show them off, make sure to return them to their protective packaging.
 Memorabilia shows feature all kinds of dealers, and not all of them are going to be interested in what you have to sell. Ask vendors if they’re interested in what you have, and don’t be insulted if they decline. Many are looking for specific collectibles, and your items might not fit the bill.
 Rare are the moments when a memorabilia show vendor and a customer with items to sell reach immediate agreement on a price. If you walk into a show with little room for flexibility, it could be a long day for you. At the same time, do not settle for a vendor’s “best offer” just for the sake of coming away with something. Be courteous but firm. In most cases, you can find middle ground if you work at it.

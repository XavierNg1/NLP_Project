 This is the easiest way to purchase a Xiaomi smartphone as all the models are available and the phone is optimized for Chinese use and networks. Also, the first release of new models will be in China, Xiaomi's home market. Visit a official retailer in any major city like China Telecom or China Unicom and see what phones they have for sale. Note that if you want to use your phone while travelling abroad, you should buy the China Telecom or China Unicom model. They use international phone standards (CDMA2000, WCDMA/UMTS). China uses a domestic TD-SCDMA, which cannot be used anywhere else.;
, The site is both in English and Chinese, so whatever your language background you can peruse their offerings. At the site you will be able to see all available models and their specifications.
 Since Xiaomi is still a relatively small company, their supplies can go quickly when a new model hits the market. If the official site is low on supply, you can try Taobao, a Chinese version of eBay. Tabao has a lot of good deals on older models and you can bid on the device you want.


As with any auction site, you should be cautious with your purchase to make sure you're not getting a fake. Only buy from reputable sellers with good ratings and avoid any deal that seems too good to be true.
Try Yixun. This is an online electronics seller accessible in China. It is a more official than Taobao, but also more expensive. , Although Xiaomi is not yet available officially in non-Asian countries, if you are outside China in Asia, Xiaomi has regional offerings to buy Xiaomi online. If you live in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or the Philippines, you can get a phone from Xiaomi's regional site. The location switcher is in the bottom right of the company's homepage.

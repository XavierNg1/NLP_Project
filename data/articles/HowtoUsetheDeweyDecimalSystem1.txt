 This system is likely computerized. If you are having trouble, ask a librarian for help or have her simply look it up for you.


The Dewey Decimal System applies only to nonfiction books. This system organizes the books by topic, ranging from genetics to Victorian England to astrology.;
, The call number will contain three digits or more. Record both the number and the author's last name before you begin your search.
 Skim the spines of the books you pass to find the ones with the same first digit as your desired book. Then search those books for ones with the same second digit, and so on. Here's an example:


Let's say you are looking for a book with Dewey Decimal number 319.21.
Find the aisle that 319 would fall under, ignoring the decimals for now. For example, "300.2â€“340.99" would be the correct aisle, since 319 falls between 300 and 340.
Walk down the shelf looking at the spines until you find the books beginning with 319.
Search within the books beginning 319 to find the one you're looking for. These are arranged by the value of the decimal, so 319.21 falls between 319.20 and 319.22.
 There may be multiple books with the same call number, so check the author's name to confirm that you've found the one you selected in the card catalog.

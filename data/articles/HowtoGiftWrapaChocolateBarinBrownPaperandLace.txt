 The size is up to you but be generous to your recipient!;
, Make the folds neatly and as exact as possible at each end. Try to avoid any bulge––less paper is better.
 Use either clear tape or pretty seals to seal the folded paper edges and paper meeting line.
 Choose a lace that is large and has a well defined pattern.
Cut two lengths of thinner, less flamboyant lace. This will be aligned next to the larger lace lengths.
 This should be done in two stages:


Wrap the outer edge wider lace lengths first. Keep the lace edge still within the confines of the wrapping, don't overlap the package––leave space to undo it at the edges. Wrap right around the package and glue in place at the end. Trim off any excess.
Wrap the thinner lace lengths right next to the larger length. It is probable that the lace will look best if you let some of its edge sit slightly over the larger lengths already wrapped on, but you'll need to judge that as you add it. Wrap in place right around the package and glue at the end. Trim off any excess.
 The center will be covered by the fabric of your choice. Choose a pretty piece of scrap fabric that matches the lace well.


Cut the fabric piece wide enough to cover the remaining middle piece of the package.
Wrap around the package. Glue with single blobs at the wrap join only (it needs to be easy to remove if needed).
 Examples of suitable things to decorate with include:


Place a card label on the front, with a message.
Add a ribbon bow. Glue in place.
Add artificial or paper flowers. Glue in place.
 The beautifully wrapped chocolate gift is now ready to give to your lucky recipient.

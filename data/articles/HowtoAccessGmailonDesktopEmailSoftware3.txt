 IMAP refers to Internet Message Access Protocol, which is a protocol email clients use to retrieve messages. Begin by signing into your Gmail account and clicking on Mail. Then select Settings, which can be found in the upper, left-hand corner of your window., This should be the sixth option to the right.
 Finish by clicking on Save Changes and finally closing your browser. This will allow your Gmail messages to be retrieved by another email client.
 Open Thunderbird and select Accounts under the Tools menu., You'll find this located under the Account Actions dropdown menu at the bottom of the Accounts window.
 Upon clicking Continue, Thunderbird should set the account up automatically. If the process fails, click Manual Setup and proceed with the bulleted alternative instructions below.


For Manual Setup, find and select the account you've created on the sidebar. Then click on Server Settings.
Enter imap.gmail.com as your Server Name and type 993 as your port number. The username should be your Gmail address in its entirety. Choose SSL/TLS under the dropdown menu for Connection Security, and finally select Normal Password under the dropdown menu for Authentication Method.
 Click OK when finished, and you can check that everything went according to plan by attempting to check your Gmail account via Thunderbird.

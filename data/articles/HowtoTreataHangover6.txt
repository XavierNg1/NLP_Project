 As noted above, sleep, water, and time are the three things that are a guaranteed cure for a hangover. If you can’t sleep, put on your favorite movie or relaxing music and close your eyes. Though the world might feel like it’s spinning, know that you are on the (long) road to recovery.
 If sleep is not in the cards, try getting a bit of exercise. Go on a brisk walk, a light jog, or to swim a few laps. If nothing else, exercising will boost your endorphins, helping you to get out of the black mood your hangover has thrown you into.


Some believe that exercise helps to up your body’s ability to metabolize the alcohol that you’ve consumed. When your body starts metabolizing properly, your hangover will start to go away., Hangovers increase your sensitivity to light and sound. To minimize your pain, close your blinds, avoid loud music, and place a cool washcloth on your head. If you have to go outside, wear sunglasses or a hat.
 While this does not necessarily do anything to speed up the expulsion of alcohol from your body, it will make you feel better (and let’s be honest, cleaner.) Breath in the steam to alleviate the pain in your head. Hot water is also known to soothe an upset stomach.

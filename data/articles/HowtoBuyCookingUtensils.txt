 Choose shiny metal pans for light-colored baked goods.


For baking, buy two cookie sheets 2 inches (5 cm) smaller than the dimensions of the oven, two bread pans measuring 9 by 5 inch (22.86 by 12.7 cm), two square baking pans of about 8 by 9 inches (20.32 by 22.86 cm), one 13 by 9 inch baking pan (33 by 22.86 cm, 2 9-inch (22.86 cm) round cake pans, a 12-muffin tin, a 9-inch (22.86 cm) pie plate, a rolling pin and a flour sifter.
For cooling baked foods, acquire two small, sturdy cooling racks or one larger cooling rack.
Purchase dry measuring cups, a liquid measuring cup, and a set of measuring spoons.;
,, If you want to grind ice, buy a heavy-duty blender. Glass and stainless steel blenders cost more but last longer. A glass blender allows you to observe the food as it blends.
, A box-shaped grater that you can set on a cutting board is steadier and has an assortment of hole sizes.



Buy a dishwasher-safe plastic cutting board.
 Although handheld mixers are less expensive, stand mixers are better for mixing heavy batters and dough.
 Buy small and large saucepans with tightly fitting lids, and a Dutch oven with a lid. Buy pots and pans with heat-resistant handles. Pots and pans made of heavy-gauge metals will hold and spread heat evenly.
 Stainless steel won't react with acid like aluminum mixing bowls do. Buy a glass or plastic mixing bowl with a cover for microwave cooking.
 The slotted spoon is used to remove solid foods from liquids in pots and pans. Also, buy a wooden mixing spoon for stirring hot foods, as metal spoons can cause burns.
 A cake spatula isn't required, as a table knife can be used to serve cake. Buy a meat thermometer, tongs, a turner to grasp and turn foods, a vegetable peeler, and a wire whisk. Choose a whisk that is sealed where the wires enter the handle, as it will be durable and easy to clean.

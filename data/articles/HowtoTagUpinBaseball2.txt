 If the ball is not hit very deeply, you may decide not to advance, especially if it's hit to left field. If it goes deep to center or right, your chances of making it to third are pretty good (unless you know the outfielder has a very strong arm)., Step on second base with one foot, and lean toward third, waiting for the fly ball to contact the outfielder., The instant the ball touches the outfielder (or the ground), sprint toward third base. Don't look at the ball. Look at your third-base coach, who will tell you in words or signals whether to slide or not. Because third base is a shorter throw from left or center field than home plate is, tagging from second can be more dangerous than tagging from third.

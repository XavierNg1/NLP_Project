 The acidic lemon juice can remove dirt and return a bit of lost shine to your brass.
 Use gentle, circular motions, as though polishing the piece.
 Use a damp cloth, rather than a dry cloth. It is important that you remove all the lemon juice from the jewelry, since allowing acidic lemon juice to sit on brass too long can actually damage it.
 Remove as much water from the jewelry as possible with a dry cotton cloth. If there is any water you cannot remove, allow the piece to air dry until that water dries up.

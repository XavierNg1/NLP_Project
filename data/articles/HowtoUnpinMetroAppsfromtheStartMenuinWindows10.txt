 Whenever you are ready, click the Start menu button in the lower left-hand corner of your screen. Alternatively, tapping the Windows key once will open the Start menu as well.;
, Once the menu is open you should see a series of live tiles on the right-hand side of your Start menu. If you can see the tile you are looking to remove, please move on to the next step. If not, start typing the first few letters of the tile app (application) you are trying to remove. This will automatically start a search for the tile name. There should be a list of results. Look through this list until you find your app, then continue to the next step.


You can locate the app by clicking the “All apps” option in the lower left-hand corner of the Start menu. This will bring up a alphabetical list of apps that are currently installed. Jump to a letter by clicking on any number or letter, then choose the first letter of the app you are looking for from the list given, or just scroll up and down through the list until you find what you are looking for.
 Once you have found the app you are looking to unpin, go ahead and right-click. This should bring up a basic context menu giving you several different options. The top option should be “Unpin from Start.”

, Click “Unpin from Start” to unpin the app. There should only be a few different options on the menu, so it shouldn’t be too hard to find. After you are done, the app should be completely removed from the Start Menu metro area.
 Once you have unpinned the app, you will want to make sure that it is actually removed. Sometimes in Windows 10 it can either take a moment to register that the app has been removed, or it won’t work the first time. This may sounds strange, but Windows 10 has had a few glitches since its release. If it is still there for any reason, simply repeat the process.

 Unlike in Windows 10, you can access the screen saver settings from directly within the "Personalize" menu.


Alternatively, on Windows 7 you can open the Start menu and type "Personalize" into the search function, then click the "Personalize" option when it pops up.
For Windows 8, tap the âŠž Win key to bring up the Start menu if you're trying to search for the Personalize option.
 You can find this in the bottom right corner of the Personalize window.
 Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 have the same default screen savers as Windows 10 with similar settings; for example, you can only customize the "3D Text" and "Photos" options., You'll find a list of the same seven screen saver options here as you would in Windows 10.


On Windows 7, the "Photos" option is labeled "Windows Live Photos".
 You can only do this for "3D Text" and "Photos".
 This value--which dictates how long your computer has to be inactive before your screen saver kicks in--is to the right of the "Wait" text. You can click the up or down arrows next to the number to increase or decrease wait time.


Check the "On resume, display logon screen" option if you want your computer to lock itself upon screen saver activation. This is a good idea if you're using a shared/work computer.
 Your Windows 7, 8, or 8.1 screen saver is now active!

Choose a ball that is quite small, so that the arms and legs don't look out of proportion with the body.;
, Cut one of the toothpicks in half. Push the pointy end of one half of a toothpick into the rubber ball. Stick the other half (point end again) in, ensuring that it sits close to the one already added.


Make sure the legs are stuck in well, so that they don't fall out.
 Repeat the same actions with the other toothpick's pointy ends. This time, position them in the correct area to form Pacman's arms.


Make sure the arms are stuck in well, so that they don't fall out.
To make the Pacman toy stand (and give him or her some cute little hands), take some little pieces of clay and stick them into the ends of the toothpicks.
 Use the permanent marker to draw a face on the ball. Add the traditional Pacman eyes and a big smile. See the image for details of the design.
 The toy Pacman is now created. It is not suitable for young children, owing to the small size and sharp pieces.


Make a family of Pacmen and Pacwomen. Give each one a different face with the marker.

 Look for places in your paper where specific nouns can be subsisted for pronouns such as “he,” “she,” “it” or “they.” Try to use people’s full name, proper nouns, and descriptive nouns in place of pronouns.Instead of saying "He found it", say "Johnny found the apple."
If you’re referring to a specific person, such as George Washington, use his first and last name throughout the entire paper instead of shortening to “Washington.”

, Use lots of flowery language. Adding lots of adverbs and adjectives will make your sentences longer and oftentimes will improve their quality.


Instead of saying “The Great Gatsby is an important work of fiction,” say “The Great Gatsby is a seminal work of literature that has influenced aspiring writers since its publication in the early twentieth century.”
Use the words really, very, and truly when possible. Don’t overdo it, though – your teacher is bound to notice too many adverbs.
 Nowadays, we often overlook certain articles, such as extra "the"s or "a"s and words like "because", "that", and "so". Add these, they'll definitely add some lines.


Instead of saying, "We couldn't go to the house, Amy thought it was haunted." Say "We couldn't go to the house because Amy thought that it was haunted."

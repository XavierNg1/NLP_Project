 Start with the ball in both hands, straight in front of you. Hold the ball between both palms. Keep your elbows straight, but somewhat loose.


Some people toss the ball differently when jump serving. Some use their dominant hand, some use their non-dominant hand, some use both hands. The important thing for a jump serve is the effectiveness of the toss, not the toss method.
 Step forward with your dominant foot, and then take three quick steps. On the last step of your approach, throw the ball upward and slightly forward. For a float, you only want to throw it 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7Â cm), like in a basic overhand serve.









The toss sets up the entire serve. Make sure your toss is not too high or too low. The ball should be tossed with your strongest hand, and the ball should remain in front of the body.
Practice your toss until you have perfected it. Just like any other sport drill, practice tossing for hours to learn the proper technique.
 Directly after you loft the ball, jump upward with your next step, using the momentum from your approach. Bring your hitting arm back with the elbow high and by your ear.
 Leading with your elbow, hit the ball with the heel of your dominant hand as with the basic overhand serve. Your wrist should remain stiff. After hitting the ball, freeze with your palm towards the target.








With any serve, but especially jump serves, send the ball into the opponent's dead zones. They should have to move to get to the ball. As you practice and learn the overhand serve, learn how to send it away from the opponent's zones so you're not sending it directly to them.
Make sure your feet leave the floor before you cross the line. Land across the line.

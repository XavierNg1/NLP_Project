 It's a black app with a gray circle that contains a black square and line.
 It's inside a white text box near the top of the screen., It’s just below the “Where to?” box.

As of February 2017, this feature is only available in certain locations.
 It’s the large black button at the bottom of the screen., This will provide Uber access to your contacts, so that you can type their name into the Where to? box and request their location through the app.

You can restrict this access later on through your iPhone’s Settings.
To check whether the Uber app has access to your contacts, open Settings, then scroll down and tap Uber. If the button next to Contacts is green, Uber has permission to access them.
Slide the button next to Contacts to the "Off" (white) position to prevent Uber from accessing them.

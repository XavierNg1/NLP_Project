 In a blender or food processor combine all of the dressing ingredients.
 Blend the ingredients together until smooth. If the consistency is a little too thick for your liking, you can add up to 2 tablespoons of additional water to thin it out. Add salt to taste.
 Serve the dressing over crisp salads, or use as a low-fat spread on sandwiches. It will keep, covered and chilled, for up to a week.

 Hardware stores should have whole sets of chisels and various hammers in stock.


Even a cheap set of chisels can last you a lifetime if used properly.
The hammer/mallet must be made of a soft material such as wood, rubber, or plastic to dampen and prevent damage to the chisel.;
, They come in a variety of sizes, shapes and tips., Spending a few minutes to hone and repair chirped the edges of your chisel will save you hours wasted if a damaged chisel scratches and makes surface marks that are only visible after you've sanded and applied a finishing coat., It is best to work on a firm surface that can handle enough weight and sturdy enough when you use force.

Avoid damaging or making dent marks when clamping the wood.
Do not tighten the vice too hard.
Use plastic or another piece of wood between the clamps and the work-piece to spread the pressure area to avoid leaving marks on the wood.
 You use one hand to press the edge down and direct it with control, The other hand follows with the pushing force.

A properly sharpened chisel needs little force to carve and shave even on hardwood.



Carve one small and thin shaving at a time. Forcing and cutting into the wood can damage the chisel or split the wood you're working on.
Hammering the chisel as a last resort, or when removing knots, making tenons and mortise holes.
, The bevel should be pointing up.
, Start off gently, hit harder when necessary.



There will be a lot of excess material cut out unless you break the wood's fibers where you want the hole/mortise to be. This is done by using a saw or by making vertical cuts with the chisel along a line.

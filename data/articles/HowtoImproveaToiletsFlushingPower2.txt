 If the toilet fails to empty completely, returns some contents to the bowl, or tends to clog after repeated heavy use, it's probably not flushing long enough.  The flush should continue for a second or so after the toilet contents disappear, to carry them over the bends and down, down and away., If it has been adjusted to not allow the tank to fill completely (to within an inch or so of the top of the overflow tube), adjust it up a bit.,  (The former are often added to save water, but not using enough water can require multiple flushes, cleaning, and general disgust and inefficiency - which you don't want to lead to the latter.),  A toilet flapper with a foam float halfway down is a simple, inexpensive, fairly effective way to make a low-flush toilet: the foam float on the chain, instead of a little cup under the flapper itself, holds the flapper up and open only long enough for the bottom half or so of the tank contents to flush it, with the weight of the top half on it to increase speed and power.  But, if the float is too high on the chain, the flush will cut off too soon to do its job.  Gently nudge the foam float down the chain a half-inch or so at a time until the flush lasts long enough.

 Consider adopting a pet. Or, if that seems like too much of a burden, you can try pet-sitting for a friend. You can also volunteer at a local animal shelter. Simply focusing on another being’s needs can allow you to recognize how important each living thing is.
 Hospitals, nursing homes, and hospices are always looking for help. You are not only being generous by aiding the sick and elderly, but you are also making a significant difference in the world. These concrete actions strengthen your bond to the universe.


Don’t feel limited by the suggestions above. Food pantries, mental health clinics, and community centers are all places that need help as well.
 Speak to your neighbors, and ask if they need help with a project. Help your nephew with his homework. Take your friend out to lunch and ask them about their problems. Figure out if they need help by asking questions like:


You seem stressed out, is there anything I can do?
We haven't talked in a while, do you have time to grab a coffee?
How have you been feeling lately?

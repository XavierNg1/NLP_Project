 Most men prefer to put comfort over style, so make sure your clothing fits loosely and is comfortable. This will also help with hiding your curves and breasts. Other items to consider:


Eyeglasses/sunglasses
Baseball cap
Satchel/messenger bag
Wallet
Wristwatch, Though men have been becoming increasingly more trendy in the past decade, your disguise might be most believable if you dress to a stereotype.Stereotypical guys don't wear those kind of accessories, so you might want to leave these out of your male disguise.
 Is there anything you might have missed? Fingernails are a likely culprit, as men rarely have long nails. You may want to trim these and remove any other feminine traces you notice.
 If you look the part, sound the part, but don't smell the part, your disguise might not go over too well. Using a men's deodorant and cologne can lend a scent of success to your disguise. Also, consider using men's hair gel to give your haircut a masculine touch.
 Call yourself by your gender-bent name in your head, go over your backstory, including reasons why you might not know things guys typically would. For example, if you don't know sports very well, you might claim to be a fan of a sport that is out of season.
 Especially since men tend to be more reserved in their communication style, the principle of "less is more" will serve you well while around other men.Trying to be over-the-top manly can betray your disguise just as easily as forgotten lipstick.

 This is a plug-in that enables Windows Media Player to read FLAC files. Here are the steps that you need to follow.


Download the DirectShow filter. You can download it for free from the Xiph website.
Double-click on the downloaded file after it has finished downloading to run the installation wizard.
Accept the terms in the license agreement and click "Next." The installation wizard will quickly install the Directshow filter (it should not take more than a few seconds) and give a status message to notify you once the process is complete.

 If your baby prefers the other parent, try to play with them more. Instead of putting them in a walker or playpen, or trying to get them to play alone, get down on the floor and play a game with them. Let the child lead the playing, and follow along with them.If your child resists playing with you, then you might want to try getting down on the ground a few feet away from them and just playing alone. Try playing with some Legos or get out a bottle of bubbles and start blowing them. After a little while, your child may approach you and start playing with you.
If your child is older, watch them as they play and ask if you can join. You may say something like, “That tea party looks really fun. Can I join?” or “I love swinging. Can I swing, too?”

, No matter if your child is a baby or a toddler, you can take them with you when you do things. Make them your little helper. Babies will enjoy the stimulation of the new environment you have taken them to, and toddlers will enjoy helping you do grown up things.For example, you may carry your baby to the mailbox or put them in the stroller when you walk the dog. Your toddler may enjoy helping you separate laundry or take out the trash.
 To help your child warm up to the other parent, let them take a hand in some of the parenting tasks. Let the other parent do things your child really loves, like playing games, reading stories, or eating snacks.This helps the child connect the things they love with the other parent.
 If your child doesn’t prefer you, bond with them by doing something new with them. This may be helping your child move to solid food, looking at flowers in the spring, going to a museum or science center, or learning a new game.Make sure to talk to your child during these activities. The idea is to do something together you both will enjoy and that will help you bond.

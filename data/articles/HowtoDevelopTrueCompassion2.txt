 Sometimes one of the best ways to show compassion to others is to extend your friendship. This may mean being loyal and genuine with the friends you already have. It may also mean becoming friends with someone that you don’t know, but who seems like they could use a friend.


For instance, being a friend might mean sitting next to the new girl at lunch or helping the new employee navigate the building.
Support your friends. Be there for them during the good times to celebrate and encourage them and also during the rough times when they might need a shoulder to lean on.
 Called by some a ‘sister of compassion’, forgiveness is one way to show compassion to others.Instead of holding onto embarrassment, anger, or mistrust, try forgiving people when they do something that upsets you. This doesn’t mean ignoring it or not speaking up when you need to. It does mean, though, that when someone is sincerely sorry for something that they have done wrong, you should show true compassion and forgive them.


You might say something like, “I forgive you for what happened and I appreciate that you cared enough about me to apologize.”
If you need to, talk through what happened and work though any emotions tied to it. Then you can work on forgiving the person.
 Giving your time and energy in the service of others is a great way to develop true compassion.It gives you the opportunity to better your community and those around you. It can also give you a sense of purpose, motivation, and compassion.


Volunteer for a cause that you support or at a community event. Invite some of your family and friends to come with you to help out.
Talk to your school counselor, community figures, or religious leaders about ways that you can volunteer. For example, you might say, “I’d like to do something to give back to our temple. Can you suggest anything?”

 You will need a cover that is sturdy enough to hold up to being brushed with a collage adhesive (like Mod Podge or a craft glue and water solution) without wrinkling or ripping.;
, You will need scissors or a small precision knife for more precise cutting, soft bristle or foam paintbrushes (for brushing on your adhesive/sealant), and a decoupage adhesive and sealant (like Mod Podge).


You can make your own sealant/adhesive by mixing two parts white craft glue with one part water.
 You can make your collage out of cut out photographs, images or text cut out of magazines, or even just pretty pieces of patterned craft paper or thin fabric. Use whatever you like: pick images that fit your interests and personality, patterns that you find pretty, or words that you find meaningful.
 Make sure the surface you are decorating is covered with an even, smooth coating of adhesive. A foam brush may work best for this., You may need to brush a little additional adhesive under the edges and corners of your collage pieces to get them to adhere properly, especially if they overlap each other. Use something hard and flat, like the edge of a ruler, to smooth out any wrinkles or bubbles.
 This will act as a protective sealant and help keep your design in place. Wait for the sealant to set and dry before using your diary or notebook or adding additional decorations.

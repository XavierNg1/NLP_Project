 Hardware mounted gates may require tools for installation, but they are very sturdy and perfect for staircases and other dangerous areas. Exact measurements are important, though. Measure the gap between the surfaces where you plan to attach your gate.
 Hardware mounted gates come in various sizes, so be sure to get one that fits your space.


Depending on your measurements, you may need to buy an extension kit as well.
For maximum safety, check to make sure that the baby gate you purchase is certified by your local children’s product safety organization. In the United States, for example, check for certification from the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association (the JPMA).
 Before you install the gate, read the manual and make sure you follow the manufacturer’s specific directions. The details of the installation procedure may vary slightly from one brand to another.
 Before you set up the gate itself, install the hardware mounting systems; this is the most important step to making sure the gate is secure. You’ll be able to see if you need to make adjustments.
 Installing the gate itself is a straightforward process. The gate should mount flush to the hardware mounting system.
 Make sure the gate is sturdy. If you have installed it at an angle on a staircase, double check that it does not float under a step; this may allow enough space for a small child to slip through.

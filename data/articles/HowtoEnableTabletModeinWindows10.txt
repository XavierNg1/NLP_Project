 Once you do this, you should arrive at your desktop although you don't need to be at the desktop to do this.;
, This is where you will see the icons such as keyboard language, volume, WIFI, and notification center.
 The notification center icon should be a little square speech bubble with text inside. Only click on it once. If you click on it too much, then it will freeze and take a few seconds to load.
 In that grid of squares, you should see that the first icon says "Tablet mode" and has a little picture of a square and a hand. Click on that.


If you do not see the grid, close the notification center and try again.
 You now have turned on tablet mode! This will get rid of the desktop and empty the taskbar to replace them both with a more tablet-like full-screen start menu. You will still be able to access all of your apps and software.

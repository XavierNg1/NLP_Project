 If you are left with a partial can of wet dog food, the easiest way to keep it fresh is to cover the can and refrigerate it immediately. Use a purpose-made silicone can cover, available at any pet store, to fit over the open can and place in the fridge immediately after opening.An open can should be used within 2 days after opening. Any food not consumed by that point should be discarded.
Do not use aluminum foil or plastic wrap to cover the can, as this does not provide the same seal as a purpose-made can cover.
 If you do not think your dog can go through an entire can of dog food in two to three days, freeze individual portions. Portion out individual servings in freezer-safe plastic containers, and thaw individual portions in the refrigerator as necessary.Freezing your dog’s wet food is perfectly safe, but it may change the texture somewhat. If your dog is a picky eater, freezing your wet food might not be the right option.
 Unopened cans of dog food should be stored in a cool, dry place in a temperature under 85°F (30°C). Always be sure to take note of the best-by date and try not to used canned food that is over a year old, regardless of date.Try to use the oldest food first to keep food from expiring.
Temperatures above 100°F (38°C) can damage cans. If your normal storage area is above this temperature, relocate the cans to the refrigerator or another cool area.

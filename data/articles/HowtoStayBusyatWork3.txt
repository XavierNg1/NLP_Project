 Keeping up with work contacts is often daunting because, well, you’re at work. When you have some downtime and aren’t busy, though, you can reach out and connect with people. Whether you are nurturing contacts you already have, or creating new partnerships, networking is a great way to keep busy at work., Goal setting is somewhat like a long term to do list. Decide what things you want to accomplish over some period of time and write them down. Once you have set your goals, you can track your progress and work toward them in your downtime.
 When you set goals, it is imperative to acknowledge your progress. In your downtime, you can evaluate how far you have come toward your goal. This will also give you an idea of how far you have to go to meet your goal.

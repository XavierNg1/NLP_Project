 Comb through your hair to remove any knots or tangles. Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to create a neat, even center part, going from your forehead to the nape of your neck.This method works best on hair that's shoulder length.
 Gather all your hair on the left side of the part into a high pigtail. Position it about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) above your ear and secure it with a hair tie that matches your hair color. Do the same thing for the right side of your head.Make sure that the hair going into each pigtail is smooth and neat.
 Find a pair of clean socks that match your hair color. Cut the toes off, then roll each sock from top-to-bottom to form a doughnut shape.The socks need to be long enough to cover your ankle, otherwise your buns will turn out too small.
 Pull the entire pigtail through the sock bun first, then bring the bun towards the end of the pigtail. Set the other sock bun off to the side for now., Try to spread the hair as evenly as possible. Tuck them under the sock bun so that they are nestled between the bun and the body of the pigtail., This step can be tricky, and it may take you a few tries before you get the hang of it. Place your thumbs on the top edges of the sock bun, and your fingers on the bottom edges. Push inward with your fingers and pull outward with your thumbs. This will cause the bun to roll down a notch. Keep going until the bun reaches the hair tie., Plan on using a bobby pin on the top, bottom, and both sides of the sock bun. Use more, if necessary., Check yourself in the mirror to ensure that both buns are the same size and at the same height. Make any adjustments, if needed., Now you are ready to rebel against the Empire and save the galaxy.

 You can buy lozenges over-the-counter (OTC) at the pharmacy. Lozenges often contain menthol and/or other anesthetic, such as ambroxol, lidocaine, or benzocaine, to soothe and numb your throat.


Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how often to use throat lozenges. If you still have a sore throat after two days of use, talk to your doctor.Do not chew the lozenges or swallow them whole. Dissolve one lozenge in your mouth slowly, as directed by your doctor or the manufacturer's instructions., Most doctors will recommend some basic pain medication for a sore throat. You should generally avoid aspirin, as it is tough on the stomach, though.
 Throat sprays are more fast-acting than cough drops and can be extremely soothing. There are many different types available, depending on where you live, and some are more effective than others, so experiment to see which might work best for you., Most pharmacists will gladly dispense free advice on what you should take and when. They will be able to steer you toward the products they think are most helpful and help you choose between the many cough drops and throat sprays available.
 Your sore throat might be a symptom of something more serious. If your sore throat is accompanied with fever or doesn't go away in a few days, contact your doctor. It might be strep throat or bronchitis, both of which are easily treated by your doctor with medication. You can still soothe your throat with the home remedies and over-the-counter medicines while recovering from your illness.

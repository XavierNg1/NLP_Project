 Whether this is a planned pregnancy or an accidental one, its always a nervous time for a dad to be. However, make it a point to show your happiness and excitement about this pregnancy. Tell her how much you await the baby's arrival.;
, The first trimester is a very low period for most pregnant women. Most symptoms include vomiting and nausea, aversion from any strong smell, tiredness. Also the hormonal changes can make her feel very depressed. Find ways to make her smile. Remind her of the happy times. Keep strong smells that make her feel queasy, away. In short, welcome all her symptoms and adjust happily with this new behaviour.
 The second trimester is mostly a lot better in terms of moods, and for most women taste buds are back. This is the time when a woman needs to concentrate on eating foods with the required vitamins and minerals for the baby growing inside. Help her to make a food chart. However, don't force her to eat or not eat something. The taste buds for most women vary on a regular basis. Some women may feel a strong desire to eat something specific at a certain time (could happen at very odd hours). If possible try to get it for her.
 A woman's body goes through a lot of changes during pregnancy. Her belly bulges out. She most likely puts on weight on the rest of the body too.! Tell her she is beautiful even now and that even if she does not go back to her original form, its fine by you.
 Whether its an appointment with a midwife or a scan, always be there standing next to her.If you are unable to attend it for some reason, make sure you ask her how it went.
 These classes will prepare you both for the delivery day and after the baby arrives. Make sure to take these classes seriously and make notes from these classes. The delivery day class is specially important for you, since your wife will be in terrible pain that day and you have to be by her side all the time to provide physical and mental support.

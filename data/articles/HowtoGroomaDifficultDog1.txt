 There are a variety of products you can use to help calm your dog down for grooming. Some are medications that your vet would prescribe. Others are herbal supplements you can buy over-the-counter, though they should not be used without consulting the vet first. Some common medications and calming aids include:Benadryl
Melatonin
Acepromazine
Thundershirt;
, Some medications have side effects or risks. Some may actually produce the opposite behavior of what you’re hoping for. Always run your choice of medication by your vet.Your vet can advise you on dosing, which will vary depending on the size of your dog.
In severe cases, your vet may also offer your dog general anesthesia before grooming.
 Many calming aids and anxiety medications won’t work if your dog has already become nervous. Give your dog the medication before you get in the car or before he sees the grooming tools.Hiding the medication inside a treat will also help put your dog in a good mood.
 Once the medication has kicked in, your dog should be calm enough for grooming. Try to work fairly quickly, so that the medication doesn’t wear off. Use a calm, even voice with your dog to avoid raising any anxiety.


Choose a place for grooming that helps your dog feel calm. If she hates the bathtub, groom her outside. If she is afraid of going in the car, find out if the groomer makes house calls.
Always use clippers (not scissors) on a dog’s hair. Many dog owners accidentally puncture their dog’s skin with scissors, which can lead to a visit to the vet. It also (understandably) gives the dog negative associations with grooming.

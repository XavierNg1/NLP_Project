 One way to cut down on stress when you're crunched for time is to use dishes you can make ahead, either in part or the whole dish. For instance, mix up a breakfast casserole the night before, and all you need to do is stick it in the oven that morning., Keeping with the theme, try to think of other dishes you could make ahead. For instance, if you want to do a ham, heat it up the day before, and then just reheat it the day off. You could also do something like a quiche the day before.
 You can also cook up bacon and sausage ahead of time. Once they're drained, stack them on layers of parchment paper in the refrigerator.If you don't want to do them ahead of time, try baking them in the oven instead of frying pieces individually., One way to save time at a Christmas brunch is to make your quick breads the night before. Let them cool, then wrap them tightly for the next morning. You can even make these breads up to a month ahead of time. Just wrap them well, and stick them in the freezer. They'll defrost in no time on the counter.Biscuits and scones can also be made ahead. However, it's best to shape them and freeze them on a tray unbaked., That is, making foods like omelettes or waffles will leave you standing in the kitchen all morning. Instead, try items that feed everyone with one dish, such as a breakfast casserole, frittata, or even baked eggs served alongside a homemade quick bread., If you don't want to make your meal ahead of time, stick to things that cook more quickly. That way, you won't have to get up extra early to start the dish. Frittatas come together relatively quickly, for instance, and if you pair it with a breakfast meat and quick bread, you'll have an ample breakfast.

 Use an elastic hair tie to hold it in place. Any type of simple ponytail will work, and placement is entirely up to you. High, mid, low, side, and center ponytails can all be made into a Gibson tuck.



Gibson tucks, also known as Gibson girl buns, are great for shoulder-length hair, as only a short length of hair is necessary to create a complicated-looking updo.
With practice, a Gibson bun takes only a few minutes to do. It's a great alternative to a plain ponytail for days where you want your hair out of the way but don't want to spend a lot of time styling., Using your fingers, create a hole wide enough for your ponytail to fit through directly above the hair tie holding it in place. Be careful not to undo your ponytail or loosen it too much. Keep it open with your thumb and index finger while moving on to the next step., Take the tip of your ponytail in your free hand and flip it around towards your head. Gently pull it through the opening you made. You may need to twist your ponytail into a spiral before flipping it to move through the hole more easily. Once it's through, tug it downward so that the free end resembles a shorter version of your original ponytail., Without creating a new hole, flip the ponytail back around. Tuck the tip and any loose hair into the pocket formed by the first loop around. Finish the bun by securing it in place with a few bobby pins.


You can spice up this look by leaving one or two loose strands while you make your initial ponytail. Work these strands into thin braids and tuck their ends into the pocket of your finished bun.

 If you plan on driving to the school, find out how parking works. Some colleges have designated parking lots for students and visitors, while others have limited or no parking for students. If parking is limited to students, find out the best way to better your chances at receiving it.


Find out where you can obtain a parking pass if one is required. If your school allows parking on campus, most will charge a fee so find out how much parking costs. Most times, this fee will come directly out of your tuition costs.
 Some schools have their very own transportation for students to get around either throughout campus, or from campus to campus, if they have multiple campuses that are located far from each other. Schools may have a system of buses, cars, or golf carts. While taking the campus tour, you could also inquire on the different means of how students get around the campus.
 If you plan on taking public transportation to and from school, find out the appropriate bus (or train) route that will get you to school in the fastest and most efficient way.

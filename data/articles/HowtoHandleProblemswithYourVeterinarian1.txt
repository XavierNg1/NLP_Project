 If you’re beginning to sense a problem—of any type—with your veterinarian, or any registered vet technician or other member of the staff, you should keep a written record. Note the date on which anything concerning took place, along with a brief description of the incident. If the concern is over a fee dispute, keep all receipts and other records of billing and payment (invoices, etc.).


For example, if you’ve noticed a non-registered staff member prescribing medicine for animals, keep a record of when these incidents took place and which staff members were present.;
, Regardless of the type of problem, it’s best to express your frustration and explain the problem face-to-face. In the best-case scenario, the problem between you and your vet was simply a miscommunication.Arrange a time when you can visit your vet without your pet, and ask to speak to them privately in their office.


This approach should be implemented whether your problem with the veterinarian is related to billing, an interpersonal conflict, an argument with a staff member, or a minor misdiagnosis of your animal.
If you’ve kept a written record of past concerns or problems with the veterinary office, this is the time to bring it up and show it to the vet.
 When you speak with your veterinarian, keep the conversation professional and civil. Present the objections or problems that you’ve had with them or a member of their staff without becoming angry, and without jumping to conclusions. Let the veterinarian speak for themselves and respond to your claims. If necessary, you can show the vet the record of problems that you’ve been keeping to legitimize your frustrations. When expressing your concerns, say something like:


“I wanted to speak with you because I’ve noticed that my credit card is being billed for a different amount than appears on each invoice.”
“I’m concerned about my animal’s health; several of the medications you’ve prescribed have made its condition worse, rather than helping.”

 If your phone autocorrects your text message into something embarrassing or insulting, you need to send a new message as soon as possible to inform the recipient of the mistake. If you wait too long, the recipient might think you meant to type the text as it is. Send a new message apologizing for the mistake.
 People today know that most phones use autocorrect software, so when you accidentally send a message that doesn’t say what you meant to say, most people will understand the mistake. Make a joke of the faux pas by texting something about the mistake right after.Text “LOL. My phone apparently thinks differently than I do.”

, Most phones will give you the option to turn off the autocorrect software. If you turn off autocorrect, it might take you longer to type out a text message, and you still might misspell words, but you will know you’re sending a message you meant to type. Some phones will underline misspelled words for you so you can fix them on your own.Check your phone’s user’s manual to find out how you can turn off your autocorrect software.

 Writing a character driven book is like writing any book. It call comes down to taking the time to write. Set aside time each day to work on your book.Writing should become a habit for you. Like working out, showering, or brushing your teeth, writing should be a daily ritual.
Find a place to write where you feel comfortable. You can stake out a local coffee shop or clear a desk in your home. Try to keep your work area free of distractions. Leave your cell phone on silent when you write and disconnect from social media.
 It's hard to finish a book if you don't hold yourself to certain goals. Try to set goals for yourself as you're working on your character driven book. Have an established page or word count you strive to reach each day. It's okay to start small to avoid feeling overwhelmed. For example, in your first week try to write 300 words a day. Then, move up to 500 the next week. Keep increasing your word count in small intervals over time., A lot of the work of writing comes in revision. When you finish a section or chapter, revise it after a few weeks. You can go through and read your work with a red pen. Highlight small issues, like typos, as well as larger ones. For example, maybe you feel like your main character's motivation is confusing in a certain moment. Jot this down in the margin.


You can also ask friends or colleagues to help you revise. If you trust someone's opinion as a reader, ask him or her to take a look at your work and give you notes.

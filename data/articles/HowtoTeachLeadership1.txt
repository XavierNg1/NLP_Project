 At work and in school, pressure or anxiety may lower a person's confidence, which will often keep them from sharing their opinions and ideas. As a leader, sharing ideas and feedback is crucial. If you let others take over the setting or you, you aren't the leader in the situation.;
, Leadership is being able to be a leader in groups. You have to handle issues by working with people. To be a leader in a group, you need to pitch ideas and be able to get the team through rough spots. Teach your students to be the one to call who is always available and willing to help.


Use group projects and seminars to encourage students to be able to work together. Team settings can be a challenge, but you can't have a leader without a team.
 As a leader, you should know as much as possible about your group and what's happening within it, even the most confidential information available by/to the other members. Make sure they don't force yourself themselves into knowing and don't push or threaten the rest of the team, but encourage them to be aware of their surroundings and the team dynamics.

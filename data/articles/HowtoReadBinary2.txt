 Let's use 101. Here is the same method but in a slightly different format. You may find this format easier to understand.









101= (1X2) power of 2 + (0X2) power of 1 + (1X2) power 0
101= (2X2) + (0X0) + (1)
101= 4 + 0 + 1
101= 5

The 'zero' is not a number, but its place value must be noted.

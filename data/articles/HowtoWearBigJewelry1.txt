 Try an abstract, 3-D design in crimson to compliment a simple black dress and tights or a thick turquoise necklace along with a white peasant shirt on top of jeans. Your outfit should be comfortable and simple, but the necklace will help to dress it up and draw attention to your excellent fashion sense.;
, If you’re wearing an animal print, for example, or a polka-dotted pattern on top, you’ll want to keep yourself from looking too “busy.”

, Such extravagant jewelry will look out of place when combined with everyday garb, so if you want to show off your brand-new gems, try making reservations at a fancy restaurant and slipping on your nicest heels before heading out.
 Otherwise there will be an inch or two of space between the bottom of your necklace and the top of your shirt. It’s cleaner looking and you won't feel the need to adjust your clothes all day.
 Several is unnecessary; a good, chunky necklace will attract compliments all by itself. Additionally, do not pair a big necklace with a scarf or any other variety of neck wear. Even if you’re trying to make a grand statement, that kind of over accessorizing is rarely a good idea.
 These are tacky and make you seem careless about how you present yourself. As a general rule, you should avoid large necklaces with words hanging from them (“love”, for example, or “best friends forever”) if you want to stay fashion-forward.

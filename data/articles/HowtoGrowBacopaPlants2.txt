 Bacopa favors partial shade although it will survive in full sun. The plant grows best if it can avoid the full heat of the day so consider planting in an area that only gets morning or late afternoon sun.


Some varieties, such as ‘Snowstorm’, can handle high temperatures better than other Bacopa varieties.
You can also plant Bacopa alongside taller plants to give them some shade during the hotter parts of the day.
 Bacopa plants do not like wet feet. Because of this, your plant needs good drainage and a rich soil. The ideal soil for growing Bacopa is slightly acidic.
 Once you have selected a site for your plant, dig a hole for each individual Bacopa plant. The plants should be spaced roughly seven or eight inches apart. Place the plant in the hole and fill the rest of the hole with soil. Pat the soil down gently and give it a good watering to remove any air pockets.
 Bacopa plants don’t need much attention once they are planted. However, you can pinch back the branches once they get to about four inches in length to encourage bushy growth. To do this:


Use your fingertips to remove the tips of the growing shoots by about a third of an inch.
 Trailing Bacopa grow well in hanging baskets. If you plant to cultivate Trailing Bacopa, consider planting it in a hanging basket or container. Add a peat-based potting mix to the container. Include some vermiculite or other water-retaining soil additive. Make sure the container has good drainage.


Plant your Bacopa in the center of the basket. Feed your plant a weak solution of water soluble fertilizer once every fortnight.

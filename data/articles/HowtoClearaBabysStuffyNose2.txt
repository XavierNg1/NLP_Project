 Using an aspirator with saline drops or spray has been shown to be more effective than saline solution or an aspirator alone.The saline drops or spray thins and loosens the mucus in the nose, which the aspirator can then more easily suck out.
 All types of aspirators work, so choose the one that you feel most comfortable using and feel offers the best results.


Bulb aspirators, which are shaped like turnips, are frequently given to parents of newborns at the hospital and have been shown to be effective in improving breathing.The NoseFrida (Snotsucker) and BabyComfyNose both have filtered tubes through which the parent can suck snot from their baby's nose. Though studies of these devices are limited, they do create greater suction than a bulb aspirator and appear to be at least equally effective at reducing congestion., Using the method elsewhere in this article, apply saline drops or spray to your baby’s nostrils. This will soften and loosen the mucus.
 You can hold your baby in your lap or put your baby down on a flat surface, facing up. Choose whichever position seems most comfortable.
 The method will depend on the type of aspirator.


Bulb Aspirator – Squeeze the bulb, then insert the tip about ¼ inch into the baby’s nostril, angling the tip to the side. Release the bulb to suck the mucus out of the nose and into the aspirator. Remove it from your baby's nose and empty the contents onto a tissue by squeezing the bulb repeatedly. Repeat on the other nostril.NoseFrida or BabyComfy – Insert the tip of the device into the baby’s nostril and suck on the suction tube with steady pressure to remove snot. If using a BabyComfyNose, consider putting a tissue in the snot collection chamber to insure you do not suck up any snot.Remove the device from your baby’s and blow the contents onto a tissue. Repeat on the other nostril.
 Use saline drops or spray before each use if the mucus is very thick.
 Whether using a bulb aspirator, NoseFrida, or BabyComfy, be sure to clean it with hot, soapy water after use.


Bulb Aspirator – Put the tip in hot soapy water and squeeze to fill with soapy water. Shake, then squeeze the bulb to empty the syringe. Repeat this process with clean, hot water to clear out the soap.NoseFrida or BabyComfy – Remove the suction tube and clean the tip of the device with hot, soapy water. Rinse with hot water to remove the soap.

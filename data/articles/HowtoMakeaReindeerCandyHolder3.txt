 Measure a rectangle that is slightly wider than the two candy canes lined up next to each other and reaching about three quarters of the height of the candy canes. Be sure to include both more width than the canes and a little more for the hem outside the stitching.
 You need two to make a pouch.
 Stitch a little way in from the sheared edge, to leave a flexible border in place. Stitch the sides and base but leave the top part unstitched, as this is where the canes will slide in.
,,, Angle the curves of the canes outward, away from each other. This forms the antlers.
 The candy cane reindeer holder is now complete.


A ribbon can also be tied around each antler if wished but is optional.

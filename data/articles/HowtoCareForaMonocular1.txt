 A monocular has two lenses: the ocular lens (which you put up to your eye) and the objective lens. You should keep both clean to ensure maximum visibility.

To help this process, you can also use a clean, soft paintbrush to wipe away the particles., Cleaning the lens too often can damage or scratch your lens. It can also wear away the coatings on the lens. To avoid this, only clean the lens when you are unable to see clearly through it. If it is not obstructing your view, you may not need to remove dust.

You can find kneaded erasers in most art supply shops.

You can approximate the effect of a kneaded eraser using wall putty, which is a very similar material. , Because kneaded erasers are very malleable, you can and should make the shape that is easiest for you to handle and use.


For large areas, you can flatten and stretch a kneaded eraser out over the area you want to erase.
For small areas, shape the eraser into a pencil-like point.
 It is best to test an erasing method before starting to erase large portions. Erasing can cause streaking. By testing first, you can ensure that you will not ruin your picture.


Rub gently in a small circle to test. If you notice streaking, rub more gently. If you notice streaking, consider trying another method.
Try to choose a peripheral spot to test the eraser. If it does smear or streak, you do not want it to ruin the central part of your image.
 You can rub the page rather hard with a kneaded eraser, because they are soft and unlikely to tear the page.


After your rub some of the pigment off the page, pick up the eraser and fold the eraser over itself. This will help to prevent the pigment from rubbing back off on the page.
You may need to repeat this process several times to remove all or most of the colored pencil. Rub, fold, rub, fold. Continue until you are happy with the results.

 If you think that you have sleep apnea, see a doctor as soon as possible. There is no blood test to detect sleep apnea. It is diagnosed based on symptoms of fatigue, waking up feeling unrefreshed, family history, and sleep study results. Diagnosis will also include a physical examination to see if there is a blockage in your mouth, throat or nose. Symptoms of all sleep apneas include:Snoring
Episodes where you stop breathing
Abrupt waking with shortness of breath
Waking up with a dry mouth or sore throat
Difficulty staying asleep
Daytime sleepiness and waking up unrefreshed
Difficulty concentrating
Mood changes and irritability

, A sleep study, also known as a polysomnogram, may help determine if you have sleep apnea. A polysomnogram records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen levels, snoring, and chest movement.


A sleep study can be done in a sleep study center or at home. During the sleep study, painless sensors are attached to your head, chest, face, arms, legs, and fingers. Then, you will go to sleep and you will be monitored while you sleep.
 There are three types of sleep apnea (SA). The three types are:Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is caused by a blockage of the breathing tubes during sleep. This is the most common form of sleep apnea.
Central sleep apnea (CSA). CSA is when the brain doesnâ€™t send the correct signals to the muscles that control breathing.
Complex sleep apnea syndrome (CSAS). CSAS is a combination of OSA and CSA.
 Sleep apnea is due to a narrowing of the breathing tubes. This narrowing can be caused by:Being overweight
An over-relaxation of the throat and tongue
Swollen or over-large tonsils
A breathing tube that is narrower than normal
Aging

 In some instances, graphing the solutions for all inequalities in the system can visually show you where some, if not all, of the vertices lie. When it does not, however, you will need to find the vertex algebraically.


If using a graphing calculator to graph the inequalities, you can usually scroll over to the vertices and find the coordinates that way.
 In order to solve for the system of inequalities, you will need to temporarily change the inequalities to equations, allowing you the ability to find values for x and y.


Example: For the system of inequalities:

y < x
y > -x + 4


Change the inequalities to:

y = x
y = -x + 4



, While there are a couple of different ways you can solve for x and y, substitution is often the easiest to use. Plug the value of y from one equation into the other equation, effectively "substituting" y in the other equation with additional x values.


Example: If:

y = x
y = -x + 4


Then y = -x + 4 can be written as:

x = -x + 4



, Now that you only have one variable in the equation, you can easily solve for that variable, x, as you would in any other equation: by adding, subtracting, dividing, and multiplying.


Example: x = -x + 4

x + x = -x + x + 4
2x = 4
2x / 2 = 4 / 2
x = 2



, Plug your new value for x into one of the original equations to find the value of y.


Example: y = x

y = 2



, The vertex is simply the coordinate consisting of your new x and y values.


Example: (2, 2)

 This grip should be close to identical to a wrist shot. You may want to slightly raise your dominant hand's position on the stick in order to get more power.
 You will need to hit the ice slightly before the shot so the puck needs to be further up in your stance.


The stance for the slap shot should be identical to any other shot. You should still assume an athletic stance and be angled about 45 degrees to the intended target of your shot.
 Do this by raising your dominant hand backwards and raising the stick off the ice.


To a certain extent, the higher you raise the stick, the more power you will get from the shot. If you want less power, raise the stick only to your hip.
You should also transfer your weight to your back foot at this step. Just like in the wrist shot, this will help you gain more control and accuracy.
 You should try to hit the ice slightly before the puck for the slap shot. Think of it as if you are shooting the puck down into the ice. This will help the puck rise off the ice.


Flick your dominant hand's wrist slightly one you make contact with the puck. This will help with the power and rise of the puck.
 Angle your hips and shoulders where you want the puck to go and point the blade in the direction of the target.


The follow-through may not seem as important but it is essential in aiming. Thinking of the follow through while shooting will help focus your aim toward the target.

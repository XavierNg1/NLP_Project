 You want to find listings that expired because sellers were unhappy with their current agent, and not because their expectations were unrealistic. Choose properties that had poor marketing or have been for sale with the same broker for a long period of time, such as six months or more.Expiring listings with potential include those that have a history of price reductions (shows the sellers are flexible), poor photography and videos, a lack of advertising, and properties with unique features that were not marketed well.
 This will demonstrate how you will take care of any problems that kept the property from selling previously. First ask questions and do a lot of listening to hear why the sellers are dissatisfied with their current broker. Your presentation should include:Your past sales history and the average time it took to close deals.
Your marketing strategy. Describe how you promoted your listings and the tactics you used to maximize exposure. Give examples of how you found the right buyers such as those relocating from another state, people who want to be near a city vs. living in the country, those looking for good schools or to be on a bus route, etc.How you would market the expiring listing property. Include weaknesses in the current sales strategy and how you would do things better.
Quotes from past clients who were very happy with your services.
 The day after your presentation to potential clients, call them to ask if they have any questions. Ask what their timeframe is to make a decision on whether they will be changing real estate brokers.

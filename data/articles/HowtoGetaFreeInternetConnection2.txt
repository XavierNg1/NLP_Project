 Many places have to now keep up with their competition--and they do so by offering free wi-fi. And you thought Starbucks, Barnes & Noble, and McDonald's were your only options. But apart from that -- places you wouldn't even expect to have wi-fi offer open networks for anyone crazy enough to need them.


So it's obvious that hotel lobbies and cafes have free wi-fi, how about Best Buy? Whole Foods? The Laundromat? Your yoga studio?Yep, that's right. Just because they wouldn't seem to need it, doesn't mean they don't have it.
 If the areas already covered haven't piqued your interest, the list does go on. Cities are now trying vehemently to be happening places; in doing so, they're going wi-fi free. In a manner of speaking.


Check out your local courthouse, library and museums. Jury duty is officially going to be a blast. And guess what? Parks are starting to have free wi-fi as well.Score.
Ditch your car. AmTrak, Megabus and Bolt have wi-fi on several of their lines. Hey, that's greener, too!
Truck stops, EZ Lube, and many auto parts shops have free wi-fi to help their customers kill time., Walking into a hotel lobby and flaunting your VIP card may just be the trick you need to score their w-fi password without booking a room. And if you sign up for various loyalty programs, you're good to go. Just install a spam blocker to keep the ads at bay.


Sites like RetailMeNot offer coupon codes that, amongst other things, have deals on various hotels that have paired up with various hotspot companies, if you're not looking to pledge your allegiance to a certain chain.

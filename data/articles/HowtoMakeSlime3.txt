 Place the pan on your stove top. Add one tablespoon (15 grams) of cornstarch to the milk and stir until the ingredients are well-combined.
 Set your burner to low and continue to stir the mixture constantly as it heats up. If you donâ€™t stir continuously, the mixture may stick to your pan.
 As it heats up, the slime will become more gelatinous and harder to stir. Once it reaches that point, remove the pan from the heat.
 You can choose any color that you want! Green is always a classic, but experiment or allow your kids to pick a color.
 Before you let your kids play with (and eat) it, let it cool down completely. The slime may stain surfaces, so make sure it's kept away from anything that stains easily or that you want to keep unstained, especially light colored objects.

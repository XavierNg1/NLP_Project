 To tame wolves, you are going to need bones. The maximum bones you will need per wolf is 4, but bringing some extras in case of mistakes can be beneficial.
 They are occasional found in oak and dark oak forests, but they can be surprisingly rare in the world, so keep hopping around until you find a forest with wolves in it.
 Simply hold right click whilst holding a bone, and hearts will appear. Do this until the wolf gets a red collar and you cannot feed it any more bones. Be careful not to right click and hit the wolf, however, for if you do, every wolf within a 64 block radius will become aggressive to you.
 Feeding any meat to the wolf will heal it, and feeding it meat while another tamed wolf who was also fed is in the region will cause them to breed. If you need to heal your wolf, simply feed it meat without another wolf nearby

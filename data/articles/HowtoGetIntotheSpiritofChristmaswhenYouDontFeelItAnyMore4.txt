 No matter what your faith, belief, desires, traditions, or expectations, the season is about birth, about renewal, and about celebration. Look at it through the lens of those things that are most meaningful to you, and strive to make the days of this season reflect your own personal goals and desire. Remember: the spirit of the season resides, first and foremost, inside you.
 And a Happy New Year!

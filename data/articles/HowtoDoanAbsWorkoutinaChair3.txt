 Place your hand behind your neck, so your elbows are straight and parallel to your head. Try to pull your shoulder blades together.
 Contract your core muscles, and lower your right elbow down toward your right hip. The movement should only be sideways, not forward or backward.
 Lower your left elbow down toward your left hip. Repeat this exercise 5 to 10 times on each side, ensuring your abdominals are engaged the entire time.

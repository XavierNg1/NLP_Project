 This will give you money to buy weapons, armour, potions, and food. Good ones include woodcutting and hunting;
, cross the bridge by the doomsayer and kill goblins. Pick up there good drops and switch styles often.
 This is the lightest armour on Runescape. Feel free to kill things like guards and minotaurs.
 This will definitely will help you. The whole set costs around 100k. For your weapon it's your choice. If you like fast hits use the rune scimitar. If you like high, but slow hits, choose the war hammer.
 Any leftover many should first be spent on food. Lobsters are best. Then an amulet of strength. Then potions such as attack and prayer potions.
 Use your special (if you chose rune claws). If not drink a dose of your potion. (Again if you have one. If you have none of the above attack.
 Don't eat to get your health up to max, keep your health about medium, so you don't waste valuable food.

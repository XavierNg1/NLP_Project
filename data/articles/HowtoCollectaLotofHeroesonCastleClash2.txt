 This will help you fit in more heroes. If you don't have enough space to store them in the Heroes Altar, sell some to get shards or unlock more slots using 50 gems.
 Honer badges are very important since you use them for a number of things, especially leveling up heroes. Be sure you have enough for improving heroes and rolling heroes as well.
 Tap 500x honer badges. Note that every time you roll with honer badges once, 100 honer badges is added to the cost. For example, if you rolled something with 500 Honer Badges, you would roll the next hero using 600. The next one would be 700, and so on. This is why you should have enough honer badges.
 If you get heroes, they will be put in cards since you tapped the Thunder God icon for warehouse storage mode. Slimes will show as essence, not showing as the hero form.
 You can also earn enough shards to buy heroes that you really want. However, only a few heroes can be bought with shards, but some legendaries can be purchased. Sell hero cards to earn shards so you can get better heroes.

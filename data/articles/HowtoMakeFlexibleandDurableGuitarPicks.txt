Metal - You can buy metal picks (ice picksÂ , etc). If you have any kind of sheet metal lying around, you can use this. Metal gives a sharp, bright tone that isn't very well suited to acoustic guitars, but sounds good with electric.

Leather - If you don't have a bass guitar, this can be a true life saver. Cut a pick shape from a real leather belt, and pick the low strings of an acoustic guitar. Fiddle around a bit after you record it, and there you have it, perfect bass sound. It has a muted, thick tone.
Plastic - Find any piece of plastic, and cut it into shape. Experiment a bit, because thickness and cut change the sound.

Credit cards - Any old credit card makes a perfect pick. Simply cut it out and use it normally. Credit cards are the perfect thickness for bass guitars, but you can use them for guitars just as well.;

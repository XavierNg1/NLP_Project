To broil orange roughy, you will first need to set the oven to broil. In addition, spraying a large baking sheet or broiling pan with cooking spray is necessary to prevent the delicate flesh of the fish from sticking to the pan during cooking.


Place the prepared fish on the greased baking sheet or broiling pan, and place in the oven. Ideally, the fish should be about 3 inches (7.6Â cm) away from the heat source for best results.


Orange roughy should be broiled for approximately 6 minutes. Test with a fork to ensure the fish is tender before removing from the heat.

 Ankle turns are one of the easiest exercises you can do to strengthen your ankles. While sitting on a chair, slide a jump rope or exercise band under one foot. Pull on the left side of the band or rope so that your ankle is pulled left. Then push against the force of the band and turn your ankle slightly to the right. Then reverse the motion so that you pull on the right side, pulling your ankle to the right as you push left.


You can repeat this multiple times for each foot.
Be careful not to pull too hard on the rope or band – if you do, you run the risk of pulling a muscle in your calf.
If you don’t have a jump rope or exercise band, you can use an old T-shirt.;
, Using your ankle, “write” the letters of the alphabet. While sitting down, cross your left leg over your right leg, resting the middle of your left calf on your right thigh. Using your big toe as a writing instrument and moving your foot from the ankle, trace the letters of the alphabet from A-Z.


Cross your right leg over your left and repeat “writing” the alphabet with your right ankle/big toe., Sit in a chair with your back straight and your heels on the floor. Keeping your heels on the floor, tap your toes up and down. You can exercise one ankle and then move to the other, or you can alternate feet with each tap.


Aim for one minute of continuous, steady tapping per ankle, increasing the time and speed of your tapping each time you do this exercise.
This is a good way to exercise while sitting at your computer.
 Rolling your ankles is another exercise you can perform easily anywhere you're sitting. Cross your right leg over your left, resting your right calf on your left thigh. Slowly rotate your right ankle clockwise in big circles. Then rotate the same ankle again, this time counterclockwise. Switch your legs, resting your left calf on your right thigh, and repeat the exercise for your left ankle.

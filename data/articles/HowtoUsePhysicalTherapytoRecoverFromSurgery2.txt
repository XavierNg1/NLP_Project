 Physical therapists often treat new surgery patients once or twice per day. Try to be as awake, alert and positive during these sessions.


Ask a friend or family member to take notes about exercises and recommendations during your physical therapy sessions. You may be on medication that doesn't allow you to focus or have extensive pain, and it will benefit you to take away as many notes as possible.
 For example, you should know what exercises are essential to your range of motion and others that affect general mobility.
 Keep a journal of your pain, progress and questions so that you can consult the physical therapist or surgeon at post-operative visits.


Stop your exercise immediately if you feel your incision is not protected, if you have excessive swelling or if you have extreme pain. A little pain and swelling is standard for recovery exercise; however, your therapist can help you to distinguish what is normal and what isn't.
 There is a mental portion of physical therapy. Your success depends on your commitment, desire and optimism that you will recover to a healthy, mobile state.
 If these metrics or other goals are not clear to you, phone or visit these professionals to clarify what you are doing. It's always better to ask and be sure, than to make mistakes in your exercise.
 During recovery from most major surgeries, patients are asked to take morphine and other medications to increase their comfort and mobility. Stay on these drugs as directed and come off the pills in stages so that your body can adjust to new pain.

 Some states have online systems you can use to order birth certificates. Texas and Georgia, for example, each have one, as does Hawaii and other states.To find if your state offers an online option, search “birth certificates” and the state. You might have to look around for a link.
 Each state’s website might request slightly different information, but generally you will be asked for the following:the name of the individual whose birth certificate you are ordering
the city or county of birth
full name of the father on the birth certificate
full name of the mother on the birth certificate, including her maiden name
your Social Security Number
your current driver’s license or state-issued ID (you will need your ID number)

, Sometimes, states will refuse to issue refunds if you purchase a birth certificate online, so you should enter information carefully and double-check before proceeding to the next screen., You should be able to pay using a major credit card or a debit card.An email receipt should be sent to your email address. Otherwise, you should print off any screen that states your payment has been received.

 For example, many maps have an area where lots of Snipers congregate and stand still while aiming, so find one of those spots.
 Make sure that your hiding spot has a line of sight to the spot where the targets go to. Be creative when hiding; use the environment to your advantage. Hide behind objects that people won't expect you to hide behind, such as a bush or tall grass. Try to find hiding places that are high off the ground; many people do not look upwards when searching for people.
 This may require some time, but it can potentially be easier than finding a target and approaching them.
 Since some taunts have different ranges, you must get in the correct position in order for them to hit. If you are using Spy, make sure to undisguise and unclock, and if you are using Scout, you may want to drink a Bonk! Atomic Punch (if equipped) to gain invincibility. If the enemy that has reached the spot isn't exactly a suitable target (such as a Scout that won't stand still), you may want to continue to wait until an easier target has come, such as a Sniper.
 Press G to use your taunt, or if you have any equippable taunts equipped (such as the Conga), press G twice.
 If the taunt hits the enemy, congratulations, you have successfully preformed a taunt kill! If the taunt doesn't hit, better luck next time! Try again, and hopefully if will connect next time.

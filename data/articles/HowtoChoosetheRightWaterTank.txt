 If you are buying a tank for water storage there are two basic options: above ground storage and below ground storage. The above ground storage tanks come in two basic styles: the white tank and the black tank. The main difference is that the black tank can absorb heat better than the white tank, which means that it can help prevent some growth of algae and other water borne organisms. The above ground tanks are smooth and round.
 These types of water tanks are rectangular and are not smooth. They have a ribbed construction, which makes them more sturdy than above ground tanks and allows the tank to be buried in the ground. If you try to bury a tank that was designed to be used above ground, it will collapse and most likely will crack., When hauling water in a pick-up truck, there are tanks that are designed specifically to fit in the bed of trucks. They are designed so that the bottom of the tank will rest on the bed and the top of the tank sits on or above the wheel wells of the bed of the truck. If you need a larger capacity tank to haul water in and you want to haul it using a trailer, the better option would be an Elliptical Tank. The gallon capacity goes much higher than a pick-up tank and they can be secured to a trailer by using metal bands that are designed to fit in groves on the tank.
 Septic tanks resemble that of a cistern tank, but are usually in a different color, such as yellow or blue. These tanks come in a one compartment or two compartment model. Depending on where you live will determine the number of compartments that your tank needs to have. Since this is a septic tank, it is used only for waste from the plumbing in the home and not for water storage.

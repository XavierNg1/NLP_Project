 Remember that one centimeter equals roughly .39 inches. For estimation purposes, this means your height in inches is roughly 39% of your height in centimeters. To make this easier, round up to 40%. Now, since percentages in multiples of ten are so easy to figure out, you can get a quick approximation of your conversion.Remember that 10% of any number simply moves the decimal one move to the left.

Percentages always add to 100%, but can also be added anywhere in between. Thus, if you need to figure out 40% of a number, you can add 10% + 10% + 10% +  10%., This will give you one tenth of your height. To do so without a calculator, simply move the decimal one place over to the left. Thus, 100 → 10, 9.2 → .92, and .421 → .0421. To continue a common example:


180cm∗10%=18cm{\displaystyle 180cm*10\%=18cm}

Don't forget that 10% = .10, as percentages are just another way to write decimals  (ie. 40% = .4, and 59% = .59, etc.)


, You have 10% of your height, but you need to estimate 40% of it. You can turn 10% into 40% by multiplying by four, and it doesn't matter what your actual percentages are. Simply substitute in your number from before and multiply by 4:


1cm=40%in{\displaystyle 1cm=40\%in}


180cm∗10%=18{\displaystyle 180cm*10\%=18}


10%+10%+10%+10%=40%=10%∗4{\displaystyle 10\%+10\%+10\%+10\%=40\%=10\%*4}


18∗4=72in{\displaystyle 18*4=72in}


, If the number doesn't go in evenly, simply divide it as close as possible, then add in the remaining inches by feet. So, if you get 50 inches, you would have 4 feet, with two inches left over. The person is 4'2. In the example, the answer is 72 inches, or exactly 6 feet, since 72 divided by 12 is 6. This division doesn't have to be hard, since there are really only a few options for human height:

12 inches = 1 foot.

24 inches = 2 feet

36 inches = 3 feet

48 inches = 4 feet

60 inches = 5 feet

72 inches = 6 feet

84 inches = 7 feet, Remember how 1 centimeter converts to .0328084 feet? Just like any other decimal this can be converted to a percentage, meaning 1 centimeter is actually 3.3% of each foot (note: you convert a decimal to a percentage by multiplying it by 100). And, if you divide 10% by 3, you get roughly 3.3%. Now, just substitute your actual percentage for 10% in this equation and you have your estimation!


1cm=3.3%feet{\displaystyle 1cm=3.3\%feet}


180cm∗10%=18{\displaystyle 180cm*10\%=18}


10%3=3.3%{\displaystyle {\frac {10\%}{3}}=3.3\%}


183={\displaystyle {\frac {18}{3}}=} 6 feet, or 72 inches

Remember that a decimal in the answer is not the number of inches. To get that, multiply any remaining decimal by 12., Remember the original estimation for centimeters and inches? You converted .39 to 39%, which was then rounded up to 40%. While this makes the solution easier, it slightly overestimates the conversion by adding this percentage point. As a result, you should know that all estimations will be just a touch higher.

You can make this slightly more precise by subtracting 1% from your initial number. So, instead of using 180cm, use 178.2cm. This is extra helpful if, instead of 180 cm, you get something more difficult, like 182cm. Knowing it will overestimate, cut it to 180.When using precise decimals, 180cm = 5' 10.9".

When estimating using the above methods, 180 = roughly 6 feet. They are only about an inch off -- but they are still different.

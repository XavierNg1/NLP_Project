 You can play the game with two or more selected volunteers who circulate around the classroom. Depending on the size of the group, you may want to have more volunteers. However, keep in mind that having just one volunteer doesn't work!, Instead of saying "heads down, thumbs up," the teacher can signal the beginning of the came with the call "heads down all around."

, The teacher can say "heads up, stand up," once the seven volunteers have returned to the front of the classroom. In this version, everyone then stands up from their desks.
 Instead of having the volunteers turn down the thumb of their selected person, they can tap or gently press on their thumbs.

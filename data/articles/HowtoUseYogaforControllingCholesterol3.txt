 On a mat, lie on your back with your hands by your side. Make sure your back is flat against the floor.The Sarvangasana pose, also known as the shoulder stand, helps stimulate the abdominal organs and can improve digestion. It also stimulates the thyroid and parathyroid glands, and helps to normalize their functions., Then, in one movement, lift your buttocks, hips, and back up off of the ground. Use your elbows and hands to support your back. Your elbows and upper arms should be flat against the floor in order for your hands to support your back.
 Also, move your hands closer to your shoulder blades. Keep your legs and spine straight by pressing your elbows down into the floor and your hands into your back.


Support your weight with your shoulder and upper arms, and not your head and neck., Then, lift your heels higher as if you are putting your feet flat on the ceiling. Bring your big toes straight over your nose and head, and point your toes up. Press your sternum, i.e., your chest, toward your chin.Try not to press your neck into the floor. Your neck muscles should be kept strong with a slight tightening of the muscles. If you feel any strain in your neck, come out of the posture.
Hold the posture. While holding the posture, keep breathing deeply. Hold the posture for 30 to 60 seconds, or until you are comfortable. Keep your body tight and straight. Do not allow it to shake or sway.
 With your palms facing down, bring your hands to the floor. Slowly bring your spine down, i.e., vertebrae by vertebrae, without lifting your head. Then, lower your legs to the floor to come out of the position.Rest for a maximum of 60 seconds, and repeat.

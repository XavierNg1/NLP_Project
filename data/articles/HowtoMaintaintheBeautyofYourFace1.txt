 The sun damages the skin on your face (and the rest of your body) over time. Therefore, make it a practice to apply sunscreen on your face every day, as well as the rest of your body (if it's exposed to the sun). When you're looking at sunscreens, make sure to choose one that blocks out both UVB and UVA rays and has a SPF of 30 or more.If you want to keep your stunning good looks, the sun isn't your friend - it will result in your skin appearing to be dry, and discolored after many years of exposure.Pick a sunscreen specially formulated for your face so it won't clog pores. Alternatively, try picking a moisturizer that already has sunscreen built in.;
, Similarly, adding shade to your face can help protect your skin from the sun. Try wearing a hat when you venture outside, especially on very sunny days., Sunglasses help you see better and protect your eyes from sun damage that can lead to cataracts.Additionally, they also offer protection to the sensitive skin around your eyes. Look for ones that block UVB and UVA rays - which most do. Ones that are larger and around the side of your head offer more protection.If you already wear eyeglasses, the best option is sunglasses that fit over your glasses, blocking both the front and sides of your eyes from the sun. Clip-ons and transition lenses provide some protection but not as much as compared to sunglasses., Tanning beds are just as harmful to your skin as tanning in the sun is - sometimes they are even more detrimental to your skin. It - the tanning bed- floods your body and face with both UVA and UVB rays, which you should be protecting your face and skin against instead of willingly subjecting them to.

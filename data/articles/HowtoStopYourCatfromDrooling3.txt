 Cats often drool as a sign that they have been poisoned. Check for other signs of poisoning, like not eating, twitching or seizures, diarrhea, vomiting, and mouth ulcers. Bring your cat to the vet immediately if you notice any of these symptoms in addition to the drooling.Your vet can treat your cat with activated charcoal, by inducing vomiting, or even pumping your cat’s stomach.
 Note if your cat is eating less and/or losing weight, urinating more often, and/or drinking more in addition to drooling. Also check for bad breath. If you see these symptoms, ask your vet to check your cat for kidney disease.Request help changing your cat to a low protein diet to help with kidney disease prevention and treatment.
 Drooling can be a sign of cat flu. Check to see if the drooling is accompanied by sneezing, discharge from the nose or eyes, and fever. Also note if your cat is eating less. Treat the cat flu by encouraging your cat to eat and by keeping its eyes and nose clear.Also consult with the vet about other palliative care, which might include IVs to keep your cat hydrated.
 Drooling can be caused by mouth tumors and other cancers. Check with your vet if you notice ulcers in your cat’s mouth or other symptoms of oral cancer, which include swelling in the mouth, bad breath, and weight loss. Also report to your vet if your cat is reluctant to eat or to even close its mouth.

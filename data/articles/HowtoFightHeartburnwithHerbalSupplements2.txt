 If you have problems with heartburn, food may be the cause. If this is the cause, you should figure out what your triggers are.Start by keeping track of what you eat and writing down any heartburn you experience. After a week or two, cross list the foods you eat with a triggers list, look for common ingredients that caused you heartburn, and then pinpoint the trigger.


This can take a little guess work and testing of ingredients.But the sooner you figure out the reasons for your heartburn, the sooner you will lessen your heartburn.
 Differing food habits can cause you to experience heartburn. Overeating can cause heartburn, so avoid eating too much food at one time.This will reduce the amount of pressure on your stomach, which will help your avoid getting heartburn.


Also avoid eating late at night. Leave at least three hours between the time you last eat and the time you go to bed. This will reduce the amount of food in your stomach when you go to bed, which will lessen the pressure on your stomach.
You should also not lay down too soon after you eat. This will also cause you too much pressure on your stomach, which can cause heartburn., Tight clothing can cause unneeded pressure on your stomach. This means you should wear clothing that is less constrictive on your stomach or abdomen.For example, make sure your pants fit and you don't have a constricting belt on.
 One of the causes of heartburn is smoking. This increases the production of stomach acid, which causes heartburn. You can use medicines, over the counter aids, support groups, or personal strength to stop smoking.


If you need help to quit, ask your doctor.

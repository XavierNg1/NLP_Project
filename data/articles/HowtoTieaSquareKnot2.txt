Start with one rope in each hand (as you would in the method above) and fold the left-hand rope on top of itself to make a good-sized loop.
This method will make a knot that's identical to the one in the method above.
As above, you can make a loop with the right-hand rope and reverse the directions to get the same knot.










For the next several steps, you may want to curl your left index finger around the base of the loop to keep it together for convenience's sake.










Thread the right-hand rope through the loop. Pull it down and through â€” it should pass under the bottom half of the left-hand loop.










Next, pull the right-hand rope (the one that's threaded through the loop) and bring it up over the two ropes that come together at the base of the loop. If you're holding the loop in your left hand as directed, these should be at the left side of the loop.
When you're done, the right-hand rope should be above the loop.










Finally, take the end of the right-hand rope (which is now to the left of the loop) and put it under the top part of the loop. This mirrors the motion you made earlier on the bottom half of the loop.
At this point, the right-hand rope should be back "inside" the loop. Pull it through to complete the knot.










Congratulations! Your knot should be exactly the same as the one you made in the method above.

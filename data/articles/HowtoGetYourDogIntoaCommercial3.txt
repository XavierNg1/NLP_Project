 Hiring an agent is a good way to get your dog noticed by big time casting agents. While having an agent is not necessary to get your dog into a commercial, it can help to facilitate connections between dog owners and producers, as well as other entertainment industry professionals. Look online for pet agencies near you, or for an agency that you'd be willing to travel to.Le Paws pet agency in Southern California, for example, hires dogs for commercial work, TV and movies, and print ads, including some out-of-state applicants., Cute videos of animals are a staple of social media and can go viral incredibly quickly. Record a fun or impressive trick done by your pet, or compile a series of endearing moments into a montage video and post it online (via YouTube, Facebook, or another social media site). Ask friends to share the video on their own social media accounts and watch the video spread.Be sure to adjust your privacy settings to public when posting this video so that it can be easily shared and spotted by people looking for canine talent.
 For a direct approach, look for online ads for TV commercial casting calls near you and respond by email, adding a few pictures of your dog if possible. For instance, visit http://www.auditionsfree.com/tag/dog-auditions/ for auditions being held in your area that might apply to your dog. Sites like Craiglist might also offer opportunities for your dog to act in a commercial, albeit a smaller, lower budget one (e.g. an ad for a small, local business).

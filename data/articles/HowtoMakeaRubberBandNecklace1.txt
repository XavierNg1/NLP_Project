 There should be a minimum of two rubber bands per loop for effect, and you'll probably want to stop after six maximum, or it'll be hard to work with.;
, You might like a single color (all red, all green, all blue, etc.), or maybe you'd like to mix up colors. Decide on single, duo or multi-colors and the pattern before you start making the necklace. Patterns could include:


One color, next color, back to the first color, back to the second color
Three of the same color in a row, then three of the next color in a row, then another three, then return to the same sequence
Rainbow color pattern.
 This will give you a good idea of the final effect and helps you to check that you have enough rubber bands.



Pinch the first loop amount in the middle. It will look a little like a bow, with equal amounts either side.
In the center of the pinched loop, tie the next loop. Do this by laying the open loop underneath the pinched loop, then bringing one side of the loop up and into the other side of the loop, capturing the pinched loop in the middle. Pull the second loop up to fully tie the pinched loop in place.
Continue with the remaining loops. Each time, turn the last added loop into a pinched loop, then add the next loop.
 Finish by adding a jump ring; press in place with pliers.
 You can also make a matching bracelet.

 Try to gently "pick" at the popcorn using your tongue. Do not overdo this, as it may cause pain and inflammation to your tongue.
 You can use plain water, but using a salt water rinse will help ease any inflammation you're experiencing and reduce the chances of an infection.The gritty texture of salt may provide additional assistance in removing food debris.Mix one tablespoon of salt into an eight ounce glass of warm water.Stir until the salt is well-dissolved.
Swish the salt water on the affected side of your mouth. Try to focus your rinsing around the location of the popcorn. You can also use an oral irrigator or WaterPik if you have one.
 Chewing gum increases salivation in the mouth, and can also help physically dislodge debris from your teeth.Sugar-free chewing gum has even been shown to reduce dental debris by up to 50%.Focus your chewing on the affected side of your mouth for optimal results.

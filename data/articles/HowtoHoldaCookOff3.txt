 Begin setting up the event two hours before it starts. This way you won’t be waiting until the last minute, and if you realize you are missing something you can find a solution before the cook off starts.
 Once people start arriving at the cook out, you will want to talk with the chefs. Round up everyone who will be cooking and tell them everything they need to know. This could include things like where they should be stationed as well as the start and finish times of the cooking.
 You don’t want the guests or the judges to see which chef is making which dish. Have your guests step away from the cooking by having the drinks and snacks in a separate area, where guests can mingle and talk as the chefs are cooking. This way the entries will be anonymous., Signal the start of the cooking by making an announcement or blowing a whistle. Make sure that the chefs have an appropriate amount of time to either cook or warm up their dish. Blow a whistle when the cooking period is over.Walk around during the cooking and check in with chefs to see if they have any questions or if they need more supplies.
 If your chefs are all cooking their dishes entirely on site, make sure to give them enough time. How much time it takes may vary depending on the dish they are cooking. Having access to a kitchen is often a good idea if the cooking is happening on site.

 Whenever you are in an area that may be home to ostriches, evaluate the landscape. Avoid open areas. Stick close to cover and note which areas would be the most safe to retreat to should you encounter an ostrich that charges you., Maintain your distance when you spot an ostrich in the wild. Consider any distance less than 110 yards (100 meters) as too close. If an ostrich advances toward you, back away, even if the ostrich appears calm. Never back one into a corner, since this will trigger a “fight” response instead of a “flight” one.Although images of people petting, kissing, and even riding ostriches may lead you to believe that it is safe to approach them, note that such images are of tamed ostriches from farms. Even these birds should be treated with the same caution and respect as wild ones to avoid injury.
 Consider them to be at their most easily provoked at this time, especially males, who are tasked with protecting the female’s eggs.Since ostriches tend to roam in pairs or alone at other times of the year, recognize breeding season by the presence of herds numbering anywhere from 5 to 50 ostriches at a time.Identify males by their black feathers, white wingtips and tail plumes, and the red flush that appears on the front of their legs.
Distinguish females by their brown feathers and gray wingtips and plumes.

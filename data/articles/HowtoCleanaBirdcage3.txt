 Bathing your bird regularly is just as important to its overall health as cleaning the cage. Choose a birdbath that is appropriately sized for your bird so that it will not have trouble getting in and out of the basin.Some birdbaths are meant for use inside the cage, while some are meant for use outside the cage. Larger birds may benefit from external baths, but bath setup largely comes down to owner preference.
If you have a bird that can swim, such as a duck, make sure the bath contains enough space and water for the bird to be able to dunk their head safely.
 Allow the bird to use the bath only with your supervision. Fill the bath with warm water, and allow the bird to splash around, getting itself wet and preening for several minutes before removing it from the bath.Once your bird has finished bathing, scratch against the feathers to imitate mutual preening. Be sure not to press the feathers down against the birdâ€™s body, as birds do not enjoy this sensation.
 Your bird will need time enough to dry before the evening. Allowing a bird to bathe too close to bedtime could lead them to getting dangerously cold during the night. Make sure your bird has at least a few hours to dry fully, especially for large birds.If you live in a colder environment, make sure the room is well-heated while your bird is bathing as well as when it is drying off.

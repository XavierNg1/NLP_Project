 Jinx is much like tic-tac-toe. However, the board is larger, and you roll the dice to determine where you play., You'll need something to write on, a game board, the game pieces, a black die, and a white die., Roll the dice to see who goes first. The person with the highest combined number goes first.
 The first player rolls both dice. The dice determine where you play. The numbers for the white die are along one side of the board while the numbers for the black die are along the other side. Match up the numbers to determine your space., Set your game piece down in the proper spot., If you roll the same place twice, that's called a jinx, and it means you remove all your pieces from the board. If you roll another player's space, you can remove his piece and put yours down instead., The first person to get three pieces in a row wins the game. The three pieces can be horizontal, diagonal, or vertical., Mark down who wins each game, as you play this game multiple times. The person who wins the most games wins overall.

 One of the little known tricks in Animal Crossing: New Leaf is the ability to consolidate fruit into large bushels. To get started, press “X” to open the inventory., To scroll through your items quickly, use the left and right buttons on the D-Pad., To group fruit together, drag one fruit over to another, and continue adding to the pile until you hit maximum (9 pieces).

For example, drag an apple to another apple. This will make a pile of 2 apples. If you have a third apple, drag that over to the pile to group them.
 If you have several types of fruits, group them all together with its own kind (e.g., oranges with oranges, peaches with peaches) to clear more room in your inventory.

It should be noted that perfect fruit qualifies as its own category; hence, perfect peaches cannot be grouped with regular peaches.
 If you don’t need the fruits in your inventory, it would be best to just sell them off. Not only will you clear inventory space, you’ll also earn bells.

Gather as much fruit as you can and group them together. Visit either the Re-Tail shop or whichever version of Nook’s store you have in your game. Talk to the store owner and say that you want to sell, then simply select all the fruit bushels.

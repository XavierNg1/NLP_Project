 You don’t want to spend hours slaving away over your cap only to find out you aren’t allowed to wear it. Ask a teacher or school counselor you trust to make sure you aren’t breaking any rules., Before you decorate, sit down and think about not only the message you wish to portray, but the decorating scheme as well. This will prevent your cap from looking like a hot mess. Get some colored pencils and brainstorm on scrap paper.


Involve your friends to make this a fun group night. Have everyone bring over decorating supplies, make some snacks, and brainstorm together. Decorating together will also allow your group to apply a theme while keeping your hats individual.A theme will work especially well if you’re on a sports team or in a club together.
 There’s nothing worse than starting a craft project and realizing you’re missing components to it. By applying a plan, you can make a list of materials and gather them up before getting started.

 Put loads of plants and trees to make it look like the forest or the wilderness. Add trees, clover patches, bushes and caves. Maybe add a few animals you'd find in the wilderness or the forest as plushies.
 Unlock your den and say, "Deer herd my den!" when you have enough people, say "Last calling!" then go to your den and buddy every one there. Ask them for their deer name and rank, but if you want to, you could use the first part of their animal name; for example, if someone's name was 'Infinity Arctic moon', you'd call them Infinity., You could graze or run around., Wolves may hunt deer, so be scared! You could fight them though, but that'd be risky., It's your responsibility to take care of your herd, so do! And also, always have fun and warn bad deer.

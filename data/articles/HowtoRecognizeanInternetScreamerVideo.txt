 Check which section of a website you're in. If you're in the "prank" section, close the window immediately. If there are comments under the video, look at those. If comments are disabled, close the window! If you see a comment similar to "Whoa, that made me jump", close the window! Also if it's impossible to disable comments, you should look for plenty of comments that are deleted by the creator.;
, If it has very low music (this makes the audience want to turn the volume up, so the scream is louder and scarier), or if it has very small text (which makes you want to go into full screen), that's a good indication that it's a screamer. Exit out!

, If it deals with scary things, like ghosts or supernatural things, this may be a screamer, but you cannot be certain. Be careful!

,, If you suspect this, scroll down and see the comments, as listed above. If the maker of the video disabled comments to purposely lead viewers to believe the video is genuine, scroll down just enough to see the video time, so you don't see the video itself. Turn the volume down, just in case it is a screamer, and if the video time runs out and there's no scream, it's safe to watch.
 If it's suspiciously short cut the video.
 If everything is good feel free to watch.

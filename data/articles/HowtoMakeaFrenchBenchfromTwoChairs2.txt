 You only want the back and back legs for the bench.


If you don't want anything to go to waste, disassemble it carefully piece by piece, you might able to use the extra wood.


Using pieces of the chair you disassemble, nail them together forming a rectangle.






Grab a saw and cut some long pieces of wood.






Add some wood to reinforce the sides if desired so the bench will be stable.






Drill two holes on the back of the chairs (where the seat used to be attached)






Screw the smaller pieces to the back of the chairs (situated where the chair seat would have been) and then attach to the longer pieces of plywood. Make sure screws are attached evenly for added support.
 This is optional, but looks amazing when added. Create another rectangle that sits slightly halfway down the back of the chair legs from the bottom of the seat box.


Add small slats using nails. Space slats evenly across the box.
 This will give a more polished finish to your bench.

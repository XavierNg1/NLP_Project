 Take her on the swings, and don't forget the slide. You might not want to take your American girl doll to go paddle boating, because she could fall out into the water, and it will ruin her.
 Go to the beach, or your play in your backyard and have an adventure.
 Set up sleeping bags as beds (if you don't have sleeping bags use blankets or pillow cases). Make a pretend campfire, watch a movie and sleep with them all night long. You can even make badges and make American Girl Girl Scouts.


To build a campfire: Use tissue paper (red or orange) to make the fire. Gather twigs or tree bark to make the logs in the fire. Make s'mores from tiny marshmallows and cracker bits for you and your doll.
 Put on your skates and her skates, or set your doll on her skateboard. Don't forget the helmet, knee pads, and elbow pads. If she takes a fall she won't be hurt.
 Have your doll play mini hopscotch or set up a basketball court just for her. Choose sports and outdoor games that you like and make miniature versions for your doll. If you have several dolls, make team games.

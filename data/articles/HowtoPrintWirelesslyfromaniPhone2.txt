 Many of the major printer manufacturers have apps on the App Store that will allow you to print to a non-AirPort printer.


Open the App Store on your iPhone and search for "Manufacturer printer." For example, searching for "Canon printer" returns "Canon PRINT Inkjet/SELPHY," Canon's official printing app.
 The app will likely require you to add your printer to the list of available printers. Make sure your printer is connected to the network and then add it to the app.


If your printer does not appear, make sure it is turned on and connected to the same wireless network as your iPhone.
 Most print apps can browse your iCloud drive as well as files from your major installed apps. Select the file or photo that you want to print from your iPhone.
 You'll usually get the same option you would through AirPrint: number of copies and page range. For photos, you may be able to adjust the paper type, depending on your printing app.
 Tap the "Print" button once you're satisfied with your settings, and the file will be sent wirelessly to the printer.

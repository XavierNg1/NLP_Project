 Simply combine half a cup of sugar with just a dash of olive oil in order to wet it. The more coarse the sugar, the better the scrub will work. If you have access to unprocessed, unbleached organic sugar, use this in the scrub as it will be less likely to irritate your skin., Wash your face with a clean washcloth and clean hands, using warm water. The washcloth should be as soft as possible to prevent irritation; many dermatologists recommend a muslin washcloth.A hair elastic can effectively keep hair off of your face while washing. A headband can also work, especially for people with bangs.
 Once your skin is wet, apply the scrub with your fingers, rubbing it in gentle circles to exfoliate the skin. In areas where the skin is less delicate, you can scrub more vigorously, but pay close attention to how your skin feels and how it is reacting to the scrubbing.If using this method on the face, be sure to use a more fine-grain sugar with less oil. Scrub very gently and be sure to wash the face with a doctor-recommended face wash to remove the excess oil. If your skin feels irritated, or begins to redden, stop scrubbing immediately as your skin may be having a reaction.
 Wet a clean washcloth with warm water, and use it to remove the scrub. Avoid using water that is too hot, since this can dry out sensitive skin. Moisturize your face with an oil-free facial product after washing.

 Flyers are a common practice when it comes to lost pets. Make sure to include a photo, the gender, and the breed of the dog. Also remember to include your name and contact information.Post flyers all around your neighborhood along heavily-trafficked areas where pedestrians are likely to see them.
Post flyers to community bulletin boards, such as those in nearby apartment communities, in local grocery stores, in local rec centers or community centers, in your local coffee shop, and wherever else flyers are allowed in your area.
It is recommended to not put your dogâ€™s name on the flyer as this may give an unscrupulous person a tool to control your pet.
 Knock on doors and ask "Have you seen this dog"? While it's a tedious method, this will make more people aware of your missing dog, and might let you in on some information that some people might have.Bring a photo of your pet or one of your flyers for reference as you knock. Also have your phone, a pen, and a piece of paper ready to take down information or make calls as necessary.
You may also want to consider handing out flyers door-to-door, especially if you live in a gated community or a community that would be difficult for your dog to get out from.
 If all else fails, and it's been longer than a 72-hour-period, call the police. Police can be very helpful in lost pet situations, and may be able to work with other departments in your town or city to see if any corresponding information has been passed along.Do not call 911 regarding your missing dog. Instead, call the general line for your local police department and let them know that you would like to report a missing dog.

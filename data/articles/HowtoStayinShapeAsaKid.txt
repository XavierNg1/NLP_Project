 Sign up for an aerobics sport, like football or soccer. If you aren't into those, try gymnastics, cheerleading, golf, baseball or softball, and tennis. If you can't participate in those sports for any reason, try finding some time to get out and ride your bike, run, or even play a game like tag with friends. Just remember, aim for 60 minutes of exercise a day at the minimum.;
, Try to limit eating junk food, like French fries, hamburgers, and soda pop. Only eat when you're hungry. If you eat too much without noticing, you will not be as confident of yourself. If you seem to always be hungry, try eating fruits or vegetables, or you might just be bored or need water. Always try to keep track of what you eat.
 You will always feel best about yourself if you believe in you. Remember, not everybody was made to be tall and thin. You may be tall and thin, but those who happen to be on the bigger side matter just as much as you do. Treat everybody with love and respect no matter how they look.

 This year should be four digits. Say 1970. Or 1988.


Let’s continue with our example of 7, and use the 2,716 number you got above. Let’s say you were born in 1970.
The answer would be 2,716-1970=746.
Continuing with our example of 3, let’s go with the 2,315 number and say you were born in 1990. The answer would be: 325.
 You should end up with a three-digit number (in our first example, we ended up with 746 and in the second example, we ended up with 325).The first digit (in the first example 7, and in the second example 3) was the number of times you like chocolate in the week.
The last two digits (in the first case 46, and in the second case 25) are your age!
Weird, huh? Now go eat some chocolate! It’s impossible to think about chocolate constantly and not want to eat some. For most people, anyway.
 The cool part is to guess a friend’s age by chocolate, rather than just doing the trick on yourself!


Maybe pick an older relative or a teacher – someone whose age you don’t really know. It will work like magic!
What the trick really does when you break it down is that it ends up having you subtract your birth year from the current year.The other numbers in the equation, though, are meant to distract you. That’s how the trick works! It’s simple but fun.

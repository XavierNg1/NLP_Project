 For this project, and others listed in this article, you will cut soda cans and turn them into lovely garden ornaments. However, these garden ornaments can turn deadly if you are cut by the sharp edges of the can. Because of this, it is important to wear sturdy work gloves when you cut cans.


You will also need heavy-soled shoes.;
, Consider using different kinds of soda cans to make your metal flowers more versatile and colorful.


However, in a pinch, working with the same sort of cans can look just as nice.
 Use a box cutter (which is also known as a craft knife) to make vertical slits down the side of the can. Leave about three-fourths of an inch in between each slit.


Make the slits all the way around the can, being sure to leave space between each slit.
 Wearing heavy-soled shoes (work boots work well), squish the top of the can down to the base. Doing this will form the slits you have made into flower petals.You should end up with a squashed can that looks like a flower.
 Your wreath can be a circle made of wire, or an actual wreath purchased at an arts and crafts store. Use a hot glue gun to glue the metal flowers to the wreath.


If you donâ€™t have a wreath, consider getting a pool noodle at the dollar store. Bend it so that is forms a circle and then connect the two ends with duct tape. Wrap a ribbon around that section of the pool noodle to hide the duct tape.

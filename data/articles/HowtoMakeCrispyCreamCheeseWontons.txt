 Take ½ cup of cream cheese and let it sit out in room temperature for around thirty minutes to soften it a bit. Remove the end and top part off one green onion. If the green onion is a thick one, slice the thick stem in two. Now, finely mince the green onion and add ¼ cup of the minced green onion to the cream cheese. Add a few grinds of black pepper and salt and mix together thoroughly.

Alternatively, you can also opt for a sweet tasting filling using white onions and sugar.;
, Take a wonton wrapper and lay it in front of you and spread thinly about ½ to 1 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture in the middle of the wonton sheet. Take a little water (or egg paste) and coat the edges of the sheet with your finger. Fold over into a triangle, sealing all the edges securely. Continue filling and folding until you finish your cream cheese mixture.
 Heat your frying oil to 325-350ºF (160-175ºC). You will know when the oil is hot enough when you start to see smoke rising from the oil surface or little squiggly lines in the oil. Drop your wontons slowly into the hot oil. Since you can eat the cream cheese filling uncooked, you only need to fry the wontons until they turn golden brown. This might take about thirty to fifty seconds or up to two full minutes, depending on your oil temperature.
 Carefully remove the golden wontons and place on a paper towel to let the oil drain off. The wontons will still be cooking a few moments even after removing them from the oil. Once they dry off a bit, they are ready to eat and enjoy.

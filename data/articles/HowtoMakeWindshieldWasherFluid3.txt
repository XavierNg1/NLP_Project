 If your winters are mild, use 70% rubbing alcohol. If you experience extreme cold weather, use 99% instead.


In a pinch, you can use high proof vodka instead of isopropyl alcohol., If the fluid freezes, you will need to add at least another cup of alcohol. Test your solution again. This step is very important to prevent the fluid from freezing and rupturing your car's washer fluid hose.
 Drain any warm weather washing fluid before adding the cold weather cleaner. If there is enough warm weather fluid left, it may dilute the alcohol in the cold weather cleaner. If the alcohol is diluted enough, the solution will freeze.

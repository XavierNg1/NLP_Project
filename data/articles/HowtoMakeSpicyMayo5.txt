 If using pre-made horseradish, simply measure out your called amount. Fresh horseradish will be significantly more potent than pre-made, so caution is needed when chopping it. To prepare it, simply chop up your horseradish root. Pour it into a food processor, add a few drops of water, and grind it up. Now youâ€™ll have a paste similar to pre-made horseradish.When using fresh, you may wish to lower the amount called for in your recipe by half or more. Always remember it is easier to make something more spicy, than it is to make something less spicy.
 Using a whisk, mix your mayonnaise, horseradish, chives, lemon juice and pepper. Whisk until the color of the mayonnaise is solid, and even. There should be no streaks.Use a metal or glass bowl when making horseradish mayo. Horseradish is significantly more pungent than onions or chilis, and making your mayo in a plastic dish can leave a smell or flavour that is less-than-desireable after removing the mayo., Your mayonnaise will improve in flavour, but also spiciness, with age. If you can, make it the night before it is needed so the flavours have time to blend together and become more full.

 Especially if your Jack Russell Terrier’s main form of exercise is a daily walk, it needs to be long and challenging. Your Jack Russell needs at least 30-45 minutes of vigorous exercise each day, so make sure that you’re walking your dog at least that much.If you’re able, walking your dog twice a day or for an hour or longer is even better.
 Physically demanding games will satisfy that pent up energy. You can play fetch with a ball or frisbee, or play hide and seek with treats. These games will require fun and stimulating exercise for your Jack Russell.


Mentally demanding games, such as food puzzle toys, are also good at exhausting your Jack Russell’s energy., Jack Russells would rather be outside running in the grass than trapped inside all day. Even more than this, they like exercise that involves interacting with other dogs. Take your Jack Russell to a dog park or over to a friend’s house who also has dogs and a fenced in yard. Doing this will give your dog the invigorating exercise and interaction that it needs.

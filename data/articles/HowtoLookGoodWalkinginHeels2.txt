 Good posture is the key to looking good at all times, no matter what you’re wearing. It makes you look confident and tall, and helps your clothes fit better. It’s especially important if you’re trying to look good in heels, as you should be hyper-aware of how your body is balanced when you are getting used to a new movement.


Lift your chin and bring it forward a bit. Don’t stick it in the air--just imagine it resting on a shelf that runs parallel to the floor.Relax your shoulders instead of pulling them up to your ears, or artificially thrusting them back. Let your arms hang loose so they have a natural swing to them.Don’t lock your knees. Some people think locking your knees will make you pass out. It probably won't, but it can cause you pain and make you look unnatural., Some people turn their toes in a bit, while others splay them out a bit. Focus on doing neither! Your toes should be facing straight ahead and your feet parallel and close together.
 If you trip, you’ll naturally fall forward. Try to counteract that by leaning your upper body back a bit beyond its normal position. This may feel a little unnatural at first, but the presence of the heels will balance you out so you look like you’re standing up straight., Any time you need to balance, engaging your core will help you center yourself and feel secure. This is especially true in heels! Not only will it keep you from falling, but it will also improve your posture (and make you look a bit slimmer, if you’re into that).

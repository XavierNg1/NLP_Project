 The goose’s natural diet is heavy in tender grasses plants.In winter months, especially, the vegetation geese need for a healthy diet is rare. Giving them spinach, lettuce, alfalfa sprouts, and chard will keep them happy and healthy. Geese may find other vegetables like carrots, green beans, and celery amenable as well.


Veggies like broccoli and potatoes make geese happy too, but may need to be steamed and fed in a warm (not hot) state before the geese can digest them., Whole grain breads, whole oats, lentils, brown rice, small seeds, and split peas are some of the foods geese enjoy. Additionally, unprocessed popcorn (free of additives, salt, and butter) and small seeds like sunflower seeds make good snacks for geese.You can also feed geese foods that occur naturally in their environment such as small fish, mollusks, and crustaceans. Assorted vegetable/fruit scraps are also welcome.Geese do not like alfalfa and cannot eat raw potato peelings.
 If we, as humans, shouldn’t eat it, geese definitely shouldn’t eat it. Things like white bread, candy, junk food, fast food, chips, and anything with high levels of salt, sugar, and fat should not be fed to geese.Young geese (less than 6 weeks old) who are given high-protein or carb-heavy foods regularly may develop angel wing, a condition which causes their wings to develop in an unnatural way and inhibits their ability to fly., Avoid feeding geese milk, yogurt, or baked goods containing milk. Geese are lactose intolerant. Consumption of dairy may lead to diarrhea and dehydration, which could in turn lead to death., Their throats are much smaller than ours and they have no teeth with which to chew their food, so it is important that you provide food in bits no bigger than one to two square inches.

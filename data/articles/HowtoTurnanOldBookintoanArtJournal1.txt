 Visit a junk store or a used bookstore to find them. Look for illustrated encyclopedias or children's picture books. Check the quality of the paper - thick and absorbent is best. But feel free to experiment.
 (Don't let bibliophiles see you do this - it makes them mad!) It helps to use a ruler to tear the page against. You are removing pages because when you start adding art to them, the book bulks out., Select pages randomly or choose pages that are 'boring' to stick together - so you leave interesting pictures and illustrations to see as you go through the book., You can go through the whole book, but you may just want to prep a few at a time.

Use the white gesso to blank out the text, going around interesting pictures. You can do this in a thin layer so some type shows through, or do several layers to completely blot out the text. You can even leave the odd word or paragraph as an island.

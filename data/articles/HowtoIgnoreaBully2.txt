 Consider ways that you can advocate for yourself. If you are alone with the bully, you may be able to get your voice heard better than if you are in a group setting. Find a calm but strong way to make your voice heard. Consider these:Say that you want them to back off, such as "Stop messing with me," or, "Leave me alone."
Consider using a bit of humor. Just avoid using humor to put them down. You might respond saying, "Apparently you are very concerned about my style and appearance. I had no idea you cared so much!"

, A bully is more likely to attack if you come off as weak or not knowing how to handle yourself. Remember to think positively about who you are, and that you are no better or worse than anyone else.


When someone is bullying, think to yourself, "I'm better than that. I don't have to pick on other people to feel good about myself.", Avoid the need to use violence as a way to handle the situation. It will only escalate the situation further and may do more harm than good. Walking away or being assertive verbally are better solutions.If you are being attacked and feel that your life is at risk, do your best to run away, but physically protecting yourself may be necessary if you are in danger.
Be safe and avoid any injury to yourself or others.

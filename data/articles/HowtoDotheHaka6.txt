 Hakas are a traditional cultural expression of the Maori people to signal impending war, peacetime, and life changes.Hakas have also been performed by the New Zealand national rugby team since the late 1800s, so its inclusion at rugby matches also has a rich history., The Haka is considered precious and nearly sacred, an integral part of Maori culture. It has been performed by many different kinds of groups around the world, which has brought Hakas into popular culture. Performing a Haka in a commercial way, such as for an advertisement, is probably not appropriate unless you are Maori.


There is a legislative bill in New Zealand debating whether the Maori can essentially trademark the Ka Mate Haka, restricting it from commercial use., Donâ€™t make a mockery of the Haka by over-exaggerating movements. Be culturally sensitive to the Haka and its meaning for the Maori culture. If you are not Maori, consider whether the Haka is the best choice for your team or group as a form of expression.

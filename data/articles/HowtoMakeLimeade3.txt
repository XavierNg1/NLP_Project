 Stir the sugar until it dissolves. The water must be hot, or the sugar won't dissolve well; you'll end up with little grains of sugar at the bottom of your cup instead.


You are essentially making a very small batch of simple syrup.
 This will help dilute the simple syrup as well as cool it down. If you add the lime juice too soon, it may discolor; the taste my also change.
 It would be best to use freshly-squeezed lime juice. If you absolutely cannot get limes, you can try using the kind that comes in a bottle. Keep in mind that this will affect the flavor of your limeade.
 Everyone has different preferences, and you may need to tweak the limeade to suit yours. If it is too strong for you, add some more water. If it is too tart, add some more sugar. If it is too sweet, add more lime juice. Stir the limeade well after each addition.
 How much ice you add is entirely up to you. You can even garnish the limeade further with a slice of lime or a few fresh mint leaves.

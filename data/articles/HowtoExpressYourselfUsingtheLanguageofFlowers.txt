 It is fine to express yourself through flowers for most events in life, from birth to death and in between, as long as you don't err and accidentally send the wrong message. While not every person knows the language of flowers, there will usually be someone around to "translate" for them, so don't worry, the message will usually get to them, and if not, it's always the thought that counts!;
, One major consideration to bear in mind is the season; even if you really, really want to say something in flowers, if it isn't the right season for those flowers you could end up expressing yourself in a very expensive way, with air-freighted blooms from abroad. To avoid this difficulty, have some back-up meanings in case your flowers aren't in season or aren't available.

, Prepare a bouquet or some other arrangement as relevant. If it's for a wedding, then the bridal bouquet is usually the best place to start with a special message.
 If it's a gift or a message of particular import (such as cheering someone up in hospital), a handwritten note to express your wishes is also a good idea, as it's likely your recipient will be happiest to read your message and have it backed up by the flowers.

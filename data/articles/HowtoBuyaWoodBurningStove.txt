 You will need to determine the heat load necessary to maintain the square footage of the area you want heated. Heat load is measured in BTUs, or British thermal units. You will need 25 to 30 Btus per square foot.


Measure each room to be heated with measuring tape. Write down the measurements for each room.
Add the square footage of each room to calculate total square footage. Although size requirements may vary, a stove that is rated at 60,000 Btus will heat a 2,000-square-foot area, whereas a stove rated at 42,000 Btus will cover about a 1,300-square-foot area.;
, Wood stoves are categorized as catalytic and non-catalytic.


Consider the options of a catalytic stove. These types of wood stoves contain converters that allow gases and fumes to heat repeatedly, resulting in a fire that is longer lasting and more even. Because of the recycling system in these stoves, they emit fewer pollutants into the air. These stoves are more expensive and must be cleaned regularly.
Consider the options of a non-catalytic stove. Like fireplaces, non-catalytic stoves lose more heat because of how they are vented. Unlike a catalytic stove, they do not recirculate heat, and therefore lose a certain percentage of warmth, as well as create extra pollutants. However, they do not require as much maintenance as catalytic stoves. Non-catalytic stoves are very common on the market and less expensive than catalytic stoves.
 Once you have determined the factors needed for a wood stove, look for a reputable wood stove dealer.


Check with the Better Business Bureau to find certified dealers, or ask the dealer to provide proof of certification. A reputable dealer will be certified by the National Fireplace Institute. He will help you choose from the many types of stoves and manufacturers available.
Choose a dealer who can provide a comparison of stoves that you can look at, deliver and install your stove, and repair and provide parts and warranties for your stove.

 Use a clean, lint-free dusting cloth. Rub it gently and carefully along the surface of the object. Move to an unsoiled area of the cloth when the fabric gets dirty.








Try a cotton cloth, or a fabric from nylon fibers made specifically for wiping away dust.;
, Place your object on a padded surface. Hold the nozzle of a vacuum about an inch away from the pottery. Apply suction as you brush the objectâ€™s surface with a soft paintbrush.








If possible, use a vacuum cleaner that has a high-efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA) and modifiable suction. Use less suction for tiny or very delicate items.
 Use a hairdryer on a low, cool setting. Rub a soft, lint-free cloth or a soft brush over your pottery as you blow it with air. Try a can of compressed air to get into crevices.

In early spring burn or cut off the dried grass leaves from the previous season if you did not do it in the fall.
Wait for new grass shoots to begin growing.
When the new shoots are still small dig around the whole clump of grass.
Spread a tarp or sheet of plastic on the ground.
Lift the clump of grass and place it on the tarp or plastic.
Using a pruning saw or a chain saw simply cut the grass root clump into chunks. You can quarter it or make more or less cuts depending on the size of the root system.
Replant what you want of the smaller root pieces and give the rest away.
Discard the center of the old root system if it has no new grass shoots growing from it. Some clumps die out in the center.



Grasses won’t grow as much if you skip the fertilizer and water only when it’s very dry.
If the plant’s growth yellows or looks spindly you may need to resume watering and fertilizer.

 In the formula, y = the y-coordinate of any point on the line, m = slope, x = the x-coordinate of any point on the line, and b = the y-intercept.


y=mx+b{\displaystyle y=mx+b} is the equation of a line. The x-intercept is the point at which the line crosses the x-axis.
 Remember, the slope is equal to the rise over the run. If you need help finding the slope, see the instructions above.

For example, if the slope is 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, and the y-intercept is 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}}, the formula will look like this: y=34x+14{\displaystyle y={\frac {3}{4}}x+{\frac {1}{4}}}.
 You are looking for the x-intercept, the point at which the line crosses the x-axis. At this point, the y-coordinate will equal zero. So if we set y to 0, and solve for the corresponding x-coordinate, we will find the point (x, 0), which will be the x-intercept.

In the example problem, the equation becomes 0=34x+14{\displaystyle 0={\frac {3}{4}}x+{\frac {1}{4}}}.
 First subtract the y-intercept from both sides. Then divide both sides by the slope.

In the example problem the equation becomes −14=34x{\displaystyle {\frac {-1}{4}}={\frac {3}{4}}x}. Dividing both sides by 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, you end up with −412=x{\displaystyle {\frac {-4}{12}}=x}. This simplifies to −13=x{\displaystyle {\frac {-1}{3}}=x}. So the point at which the line crosses the x-axis is (−13,0){\displaystyle ({\frac {-1}{3}},0)}. So the x-intercept is −13{\displaystyle {\frac {-1}{3}}}.
 On a coordinate graph, plot your y-intercept, then draw a line using the slope. To find the x-intercept, look for the point where the line crosses the x-axis.

For example, if the slope is 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, and the y-intercept is (0,14){\displaystyle (0,{\frac {1}{4}})}, draw a point at (0,14){\displaystyle (0,{\frac {1}{4}})}, then draw other points along the line by counting to the left 3 and down 4, and to the right 3 and up 4. When you draw a line through the points, you should see the line cross the x-axis just left of the (0,0) coordinate.

 This isn't just to look cool -- moving another part of your body along with beat helps you sink into the groove, making it easier to sync your strumming up. Tap a foot or nod you head.
 With the guitar in your hand, simply count with the metronome -- "1, 2, 3, 4 // 1, 2, 3, 4 // 1, 2..." Once you feel comfortable with the beat, keep counting as you drop in with the guitar, letting your voice help guide you with the rhythm.









If you're really struggling, adjust the tempo. Don't practice at a pace that forces you to make multiple mistakes -- you want to learn to hold consistent rhythm.
 The first beat of every measure is a good benchmark to hit on time, especially if you're struggling. Counting out the beats, just focus on strumming on the first beat for a few measures. Get use to where the beat "resets." When playing with other musicians, the most essential beat to hit in any measure is usually the first one.
 At the end of the day, you're not going to be on stage with a metronome -- you'll be with a percussionist, other guitarist, or no one at all. That said, many recording studios use metronomes, so you do need both skills. Never rely on just one or the other to practice rhythm -- both of them are essential to becoming a top guitarist.

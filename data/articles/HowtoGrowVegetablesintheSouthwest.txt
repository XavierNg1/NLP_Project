 That way, they will be tall and strong enough to transplant outdoors in the spring.;
,


Let the transplants sit outside in a protected spot for several hours every day. The tender seedlings need time to adjust to stronger sunlight, cooler nights and less water.
 Spring weather is unpredictable and can include high winds, below normal temperatures and late snowfall:


Fill inner tubes with water and put your transplants in the middle of the inner tube. The water will retain heat from the sun and release the heat during the evening. Remove the inner tube when the plants can withstand cooler night temperatures.
Cut the bottoms off of large plastic jugs and push the containers into the soil over your transplants. Make sure the jugs are deep enough into the soil that they don’t blow away. Remove the jug’s cap to increase air circulation. Insert the container over your plant at nightfall and remove it during the day.
 The simplest type is made with wire loops and covered with clear plastic. The plastic needs to be anchored down and at least one end of the structure has to allow some air into the greenhouse. Even with ventilation, the soil in a southwest greenhouse could get too hot unless you mulch your plants with straw or another type of composting material.

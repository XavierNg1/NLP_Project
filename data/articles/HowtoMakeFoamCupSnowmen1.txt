Wrap your piece of construction paper or felt around the foam cup three to four inches from the top, leaving enough space to create the snowman's face.Wrap your felt on a downward slope on the front of your snowman so that it looks more like a scarf.
 Use a black marker or dark pen to draw two circles above your scarf that will represent the snowman's eyes and mouth. Alternatively, you can cut out circles using black felt or paper and glue them onto your cup to represent the snowman's eyes.Another option is to use black buttons to represent the eyes.
 This orange triangle will represent the carrot nose for your snowman. Use a piece of felt or construction paper. If you don't have these materials, you can use an orange pen.
 Bend a pipe cleaner over the top of your snowman's head. Trim the excess pipe cleaner so that only a half inch (1.27 centimeters) hang down on both sides. Attach two pom poms or cotton balls on the side of the pipe cleaner with glue. This will make it look like your snowman has earmuffs.

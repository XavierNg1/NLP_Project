 However, you should allow your dog access to drinking water. Withholding food from your dog can allow your dog’s stomach to rest and reduces the amount of acid that the stomach produces.


When the amount of acid is reduced, the esophagus will be able to create a fresh layer of mucus to fend off stomach acid with.;
, After 24 to 48 hours of not feeding your dog, you can begin to reintroduce food. Avoid high-fat, high-protein diets because these cause the stomach to produce acid. Instead offer carbohydrate such as rice, pasta, or boiled potatoes, with lean white meats such as chicken, turkey, cod, or coley fish.


Examples of "bad" foods includes fatty mince, sausages, bacon, cream, butter, and pate.
 If you feed your dog two or three large meals a day, there is more of a chance that his stomach will become very full, which in turn can stretch the esophageal sphincter and allow acid to leak out of the stomach.


Continue feeding your dog four small low-fat, low protein meals a day until he has been symptom free for at least 7 days. After these 7 days have passed, you can consider putting him back on his regular diet.
 Putting your dog’s food up high will force your dog to eat with his head raised above his shoulders. This makes his esophagus into a downhill slope to his stomach, which will help to keep the food in his stomach, rather than being regurgitated back up.

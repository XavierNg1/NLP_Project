 Only registered users are allowed to vote in Requests for Adminship discussions. If you don't already have one, create an account.;
,, Current discussions will be listed under the "Current nominations for adminship" section.
 You'll also want to look at the comments in the support and oppose sections to see any problems that the user may have, as well as the links in the RfA/RfB toolbox below the questions.
, Be sure to give a good reason for why you're voting support, oppose, or neutral. The reasons that users give support, oppose, or neutral votes will play just as much as a factor in deciding whether consensus has been reached for promoting the user to administrator as the percentage of support, oppose, and neutral votes themselves. Also be sure to sign your comment by adding four tildes next to it.

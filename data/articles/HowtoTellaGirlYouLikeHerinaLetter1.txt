 Don’t worry about organization. Just open your heart and let it spill. Even if it sounds weird on paper, you can always change it later.;
, Just like in English class, writing a great letter that will make her smile requires a process.
 Let her know that you find her special and that you would like a chance to get to know her better.
 Similes such as, “Your eyes are like a deep blue ocean” or “Your smile is like a sunrise that welcomes a wonderful day” are ideas of how to make your letter stand out. Don’t overdo it, but a little spice in the soup will get her attention.
 If she’s interested, this will get her excited.
, You just want to let her know how you feel.

Stir them around to make sure they don't stick or burn. Heat the seasonings for about 2 minutes to toast them.If you prefer, you can also saute the rice first. Add the optional oil to the pan over medium heat.
Put the rice in, and let it cook for a few minutes. Add the spices (cumin, saffron, and garam masala) and let them cook a few minutes, too.
If you're using cashews, add them when you add the spices. Wait a few minutes, and add the peas, if you want to use them. Let them cook for a minute., Pour the 1 3/4 cup of liquid into the pan. Next, add in the cup of rice. If you've already toasted the rice, just add in the liquid. Let the mixture come to a boil over high heat with a lid.You can use water, but stock will add more flavor.
The salt is up to you. You can add it if you prefer saltier foods.
 Once the pot boils, turn the burner to low. Keep the pot covered. Let the rice simmer for about 15 minutes. Once 15 minutes is up, take it off the stove, and let it rest, covered, for 10 minutes.

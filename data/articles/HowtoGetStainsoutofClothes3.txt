 Applying an absorbent, such as salt, can coax the stain out of your clothing. Layer salt, baking soda, talcum powder, or cornstarch on top of the stained area, and let it sit for fifteen minutes. Then, remove and rinse.
 Reverse your stained garment, so that the stain is facing away from you. Then, apply your selected stain remover to the back of the stain. The solvent will soak through and push the stain towards the surface of the fabric.
 Place the stained side of the fabric on a flat paper towel. This allows the solvent to push the stain from the fabric into some other absorbent surface. The substance causing the stain will then be able to leave the fabric., In order to give your solvent time to work, allow the garment to lie face down on the paper towel for about an hour. However, do not let the fabric dry out, or the stain may set, negating of all your previous effort., After you complete all the previous steps, put your garment immediately in the washing machine, or wash it thoroughly by hand. This will allow all the solvent and the stain to rinse clean of the garment, leaving you with an unstained clothing item.

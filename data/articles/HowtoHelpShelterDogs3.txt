 One of the best ways to help shelter dogs is to adopt one yourself. By giving a dog a permanent, loving home, you not only reduce the burden on the shelter but you also free a spot for another homeless dog at the shelter., When you foster a dog, you care for the dog in your home while the shelter looks for a potential owner. This is a temporary situation. By letting the dog into your home, you open up a spot for another dog at the shelter.Make sure that you can handle giving the dog away when they are adopted.
You may have to housebreak the dog and train them. This will help the dog find a good home more quickly.
 The best way to prevent overcrowding at shelters is to prevent more dogs from entering the system. Spaying or neutering your dog will prevent them from having puppies of their own. It may also help current homeless dogs find a home.


If you do not have a dog, you can encourage others to spay or neuter their dogs. Point out the benefits of spaying and neutering. You might say, "spayed female dogs live longer" or "neutered male dogs won't wander from home as often.", If you can’t adopt a dog yourself, you can encourage others to rescue a dog instead of buying one from a store or breeder. If a friend or family member is considering getting a dog, talk to them about the benefits of adoption.


You might say, “You should consider adopting from the local animal shelter. It’s a great way to save a life.”
You can bring up the benefits of adopting. For example, you might say, “It is much cheaper to adopt a dog” or “many dogs in animal shelters are already trained.”, Social media is a powerful tool to help shelter dogs find homes. Like the pages of your local shelters social media pages. They will often post notices of dogs who need homes. Share these on Facebook, Twitter, and other networking apps to spread the word. This will help the dog find a home more quickly.

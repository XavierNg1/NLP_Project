 These will all help you once you have totally controlled these important parts of basketball.;
, Try getting the ball, and shoot. Either with a lay-up or outside shot. Although, remember to not be a ball hog and force up a shoot, pass the ball around, too!

, At the beginning, they will only notice your misses, but as you improve they will only notice what goes in! And that's what you want don't you?

, You can shoot and do anything else when you feel necessary. The worst that can happen is that you will be taken out of the game or be yelled at.
 That is the most important part of it all! Don't let people step all over your confidence, because sadly we live in that kind of a world. Block out your teammates bad words and change them with good words.
 You will eventually get there. Take what Brian Scalabrine said after the Celtics kicked Laker butt: "In five years you won't remember my misses, in ten years I'll be an MVP of the league, in 15 years I'll lead my team to an NBA championship and in 60 years I'll be telling my grand kids about all my accomplishments." I have written these words on my wall and read them to myself every morning. These words are very meaningful and you should really think about them.
 Being with them and playing with them will really influence you.

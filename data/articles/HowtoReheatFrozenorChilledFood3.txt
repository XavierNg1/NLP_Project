 Certain foods don’t reheat well in the microwave, especially ones that are supposed to be crispy or have a crust. Foods that are good to reheat in the microwave are ones that have a lot of moisture, such as:Soups
Steamed vegetables
Boiled vegetables
Casseroles
Rice
Stews

, Larger items will take longer to cook, and if you try to reheat large and small items at the same time, the smaller items will be overcooked and the larger ones undercooked.


You can either cut larger items into smaller pieces, or precook them before recombining the dish.
For instance, if you're reheating a large piece of meat and some vegetables, cook the meat first, or cut the meat into smaller bites and cook it with the vegetables.
 Spread the food out in a single layer to ensure even cooking time. Make sure the dish is safe for the microwave, and doesn’t contain any metal.


Dishes that are microwave-safe include glass and ceramic ones., Food cooked in the microwave is at risk of drying out, so it’s important to cover the food. Some microwave dishes come with lids, but if you don’t have one, cover the dish with a damp towel or paper towel. This will help keep in moisture.For dishes with lids, only close the lid partially to allow steam to escape.
 For smaller servings, set the microwave to cook for one to two minutes. For larger servings, cook for three to four minutes. After that time, stir the food to distribute the heat, and then check the temperature. Cook for in additional one- to two-minute intervals until the food is hot. Stir in between each interval.


Microwaves tend to have hot and cold spots, which is why stirring is so important.

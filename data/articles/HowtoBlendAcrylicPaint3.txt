 Paint a base coat and let it dry completely. It should be darker then the color you want to blend over it, like black as the base coat to blending with grey.









Use sweeping horizontal lines to make your base coat., The black base coat must be completely dry before you continue.
 Using a damp paintbrush, paint a thin line of grey on the part you want to be the lightest in the painting.
 Take another brush, and dip it in water so it is damp.









You can also use the same paintbrush to add to the blending effect if you don't mind the previous colors being blended into the current colors.
 Carefully whisk away some of the grey onto the black so they blend. Do this is in a controlled fashion. The end result will go from grey to dark grey to black.
 Once the paint is dry, you'll have a nicely blended dark to light painting.

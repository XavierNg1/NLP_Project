 Newspaper usually works well for this, if it is big enough. If you can’t find a newspaper large enough, any large craft paper will work. As you draw around the string frame, leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) extra around it.


You don’t need to be too careful about making perfectly straight lines because what you trace will be folded later.
 Set the frame to the side and cut the kite shape out. You can discard the extra paper, as you won’t need it anymore. Be careful to stay right on the line, or even outside it a little bit, so you don’t cut the kite too small.


Once you have finished cutting it out, lay it flat on the table and lay the frame on top of it.
 Make sure the frame is centered on the kite body. Going around the kite one side at a time, fold the paper over the string. Tape the corners first and then put some tape around each folded edge.


For extra support, you can put a few pieces of tape along the dowels to secure them in place.
 Now that the kite is fully constructed, tie a string to it, which you will hold when you fly the kite. You’ll want it to be around 20 yards (18 meters) or so. Make sure it’s long enough that the kite can fly freely.

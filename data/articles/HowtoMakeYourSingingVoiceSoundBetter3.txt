 Having a professional guide you in your healthy singing habits is the ultimate resource. Consult your arts teachers at your school or music stores for information.


Often universities have students who are training to be vocal teachers offer lessons at a reduced fee. These students are taking pedagogy classes and are anxious for students of their own.
If you aren't interested in one-on-one work or can't afford it, consider joining your local or school choir.
 There is a ton of information to be found online (apart from wikiHow, sadly). Search for videos, different schools of thought regarding training, and websites on extra tips and tricks.
 It's possible your voice isn't suited for the genres you listen to. Find songs you wouldn't normally hear on your iPod and see how your voice responds.


Each voice has a different quality about it. Country singers often have a twang; jazz singers are often a bit smokey. Take the qualities of your voice and run with it.
It is said that classical singers can sing everything, but pop singers can only sing pop. If you are looking to train, look into classical teachers to give you a well-balanced repertoire.

 Allow one side of the scarf to rest behind your neck. The rest of the fabric of the scarf should hang down the front of your body.








The first step of the double loop is the same as the first step of the single loop.
 Create a figure 8 in front of your body by crossing the lower right portion of the scarf over the lower left portion. The cross should be directly in front of your neck. This will create two loops. One loop will be around your neck. The other will be right in front of your neck.








It does not matter which way you cross the fabric. You could also cross the lower left portion of the scarf over the lower right portion.
 Pull the lower loop up and over your head.








Both ends of the loop should now be at the back of your neck.
The point of intersection created by crossing the scarf should now lie in front of your neck.
 Pull on the ends of the loops until both loops are as big or small as desired.Create a layered look by making one loop slightly longer than the other.
 Pull the top layer over your head, creating a hood. Adjust the scarf as needed.

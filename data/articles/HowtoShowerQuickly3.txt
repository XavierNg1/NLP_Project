 Squeeze a dollop of soap onto your hand, and spread your palm and fingers as wide as possible. Use your outstretched hand to quickly and efficiently cover the maximum surface area of your body. You may be surprised how much area your hands can cover when they're fully spread out. For instance, you may be able to lather each leg in one pass if you can almost reach around them.


Try using a scrubber or loofah with body wash already applied. This can be a great way to cover surface area.
Work symmetrically with both hands, lathering each side of your body at the same time. Lather each side of your chest and torso, under both arms, up both legs – all in tandem, with your hands spread out. This technique also works with lathering your hair quickly, as well as for drying off quickly.
 If exfoliation is part of your daily routine, consider doing it in the shower so that it's easier to wash off the skin particles. This is not a way to shower more quickly, per se – but it may help you streamline your general morning routine., You might need to look in the mirror to shave your face, but you can shave other parts of your body while the water streams around you. Try shaving your chest, your legs, or any other area that needs a touch-up. Lather up with lotion or shaving cream. Shave gently and methodically, and let the water wash away the loose hairs.


This works best for just a touch-up shave. If your body is very hairy, then you run the risk of clogging the shower drain.

 Edwin has short black hair (scissors and black hair dye can help you with this step) and wears short sleeved shirts and jeans usually. Sneakers also work. Sometimes put on a cape and be "Edweirdo" but not all the time! Dress casually, sort of messy even.;
, Edwin is always working on some kind of deal or bet, usually with his brother Derek. Start one with your sibling. If you don't have siblings then you can easily start one at school with a friend.
 Edwin does his brother's homework for a bit of cash. If you are offered some green, don't resist..do it.
 This is Edwin's hang out where he discusses plans with his best friend and stepsister, Lizzie. Try to find a sibling to meet you in there or a friend if again you don't have any siblings.
 Edwin has a habit of telling jokes like these.

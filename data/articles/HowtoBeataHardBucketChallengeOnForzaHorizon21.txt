 Usually when you do a hard bucket challenge, they give you less time to get to a certain destination. But when you follow the route, you don't make it in time. The only way to beat it is to improvise your own route where it is far away from the route.


When you improvise the route, you have to be careful because depending on if you are in storm island or at the horizon, there are certain obstacles that can come your way like trees, boulders, and walls.;
, That way, you can be able to get there faster. Think of it as a shortcut.


When you do your own shortcut route you have to watch out for trees if you're going off road because it can cause you to obviously crash and maybe even damage your car engine.
 The key to winning a hard challenge is not braking because braking slows your car down and kills time when it comes to doing the challenge.


Instead of braking, try to drift but control the left stick on your xbox controller so it won't rotate the opposite direction. An easy way to drift is to either tap LT and control the left stick or tap A and control the joystick.



One obstacle you need to dodge depending on your area in the bucket challenge is big barrels. They can slow you down if you hit them as well so watch out for them.

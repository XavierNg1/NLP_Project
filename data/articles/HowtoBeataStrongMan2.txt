 Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a martial art that was developed by the Gracie family in Brazil. It incorporates aspects of Japanese Jiu Jitsu and Judo. It is a grappling martial art that concentrates on choke holds and joint locks. It was first developed as a method for smaller fighters to defeat larger opponents, and can help you in beating someone that's stronger than you.Brazilian Jiu Jitsu also reduces stress.
In addition to being a self-defense tactic, Brazillian Jiu Jitsu increases your mobility, agility, and flexibility.Helio Gracie developed Brazillian Jiu Jitsu as a way to defeat his older, larger brothers on the mat., The art of Judo uses your opponents momentum and size against them in the form of throws. Even though your opponent may be bigger, it doesnâ€™t mean they are immune to being thrown. Think of ways to use his size to your advantage. For example, instead of meeting him face on, try tripping his feet while he charges forward at you.


Judo uses balance and leverage rather than brute strength to throw the opponent on the ground.You can incapacitate a strong man with a single throw. In competition this is known as an ippon., The endurance and mobility of a strong man may be adversely affected by his muscle mass.Because of this, you can stay mobile and elusive as he gets tired. Once he is, you can take advantage of him.


Feinting or faking punches may cause your opponent to react. Keep moving around him laterally and try to stay out of the way of his strikes. Make him swing and miss as much as possible.
Do not get into a brawl with someone stronger than you. A single punch can knock you unconscious, so make sure to keep peppering shots with jabs and never try to stand punch for punch with him.

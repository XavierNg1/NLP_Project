 Save an aluminum can that you are finished with, or grab an old one out of your recycling bin. Make sure all of the food or liquid is out of the can. Give the can a good wash with soap and water to make sure it's clean.


Remember to use a soapy water and rice mixture to clean a soda can that you haven't removed the lid from.
 Use your scissors or box cutter to create small incisions around the can. Angle the incisions toward the base of the can. If using a can with harder aluminum, you may need to drill holes large enough for the pencils, as the metal will be too hard to push the utensils through.


Use a small hand drill to create cleaner holes in the can. Be careful to drill slowly, as you don't want to tear a large hole in the can. Soda cans in particular are easily damaged by excessive force., When the pencils are pushed through, they will need to sit in the can angled toward the bottom of the can. This allows a large number of pencils to be stored without offsetting the balance of the can.


Frequently inserting and removing pencils from the can may eventually wear down the can, the pencils, or both. Keep pencils or pens you are particularly attached to in a location that subjects them to less wear and tear.
 Placing silly straws, mini-umbrellas, or national flags among the pencils is a great way to introduce a little color to your pencil holder. Try stacking a second soda can pin cushion atop the first and make a multi-level pencil holder! Go for the world record of stacked cans!

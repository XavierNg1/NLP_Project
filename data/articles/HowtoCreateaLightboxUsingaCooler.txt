 If you don't have one in the garage, you might need to get one. You want a cooler because of the white interior.


Be sure that the handle is the square kind that goes around it. The source article has a perfect example.

Note: This particular ice chest is pretty small. You might want something a little larger.


If the cooler isn't as pristine as you would like it, it is very easy, because of its size and shape, to put in some poster paper in it.;
, You want something that is maneuverable. The best kind is a shot lamp with a clamp. Alternatively, try using a flexible neck desk lamp. The inside of the light cover should be reflective or white.
 You will want a bright bulb. Experiment with different types. There are cooler lightbulbs that you can get, but you might have to alter the white balance of your shots. Figure out what works.
 If you need to, put in the posterboard in it.
 It will need to be in front of it, so you can fasten the lamp.
 You are wanting to light the box, not blind it.
 Depending on the heat of the bulb, you will only want to use this for short periods of time at most.

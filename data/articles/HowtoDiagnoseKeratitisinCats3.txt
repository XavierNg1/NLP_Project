 The treatment depends on the underlying reason for the keratitis and the symptoms. Common treatments for keratitis are eye drops or a topical ointment since eye infections are common.


Your vet may also recommend giving your cat some kind of supplement to help boost her immune system, such as L-Lysine. This is supposed to help decrease the chance of a recurring corneal ulcer.If your cat has the herpes virus, the eye may not respond to the same treatments. Anti-virals may be given, along with an antibiotic for any present infection.If the swelling in the eye is bad, the vet may give the cat anti-inflammatory drugs., A cat with the feline herpes virus can infect another cat, which may lead to keratitis. If you know your cat or another cat has keratitis due to an infectious disease, separate them until the cat has been treated and healed.An infectious disease like feline herpes can be contracted through contact with bodily fluids such as saliva, nasal or ear discharge, and sneeze droplets.
The virus can also be contracted from litter trays, food and water bowls, and bedding.
 Since a common reason cats get keratitis is due to the feline herpes virus, you should vaccinate your cat. While vaccinations wonâ€™t eliminate the chances of your cat getting FHV, it will significantly reduce the risk.You can get your cat vaccinated against FHV at around eight weeks. It initially takes two or three injections, then a booster at one year, then boosters every one to three years.
 Keratitis is an umbrella term to describe the appearance of an affected eye. There is no one cause of keratitis. Anything that produces prolonged irritation on the surface of the eye can trigger the inflammation associated with keratitis.


Common triggers include a herpes virus infection, a blow to the eye like a scratch sustained during a catfight, or rubbing on the surface of the eye, such as from eyelashes from inturned eyelids.

 You can check which Hold youâ€™re in by pressing the Start button (PS3 and Xbox 360) or ESC key (PC) and scrolling to the left under ****. Here, check your bounty amount in each Hold.
 When you enter the Hold, you will be confronted by any guard you pass. He will give you the option to pay off your bounty, go to jail, or refuse arrest.


If you do not have enough gold to pay off your bounty, or simply do not want to pay it off, then you will have to serve time in prison.
 You will be transported to the nearest jail. All of your items save a single lockpick will be taken from you. You can use this lockpick to escape jail; however, this will only raise your bounty.
 To serve the duration of your sentence, sleep in your cell bed. Approach the bed, and press the X button (PS3), A button (Xbox 360), or E Key (PC) to sleep. When your character awakens, their sentence will be over just like that. Your character will automatically wake, so just wait a few minutes.


After your character awakens, you will be brought to the front of the prison, and given back all of your items (except the stolen ones), and you will be free to go. Your bounty will be cleared.
Serving your sentence causes your character to lose progress towards skill level advancements. The longer your sentence is, the more skills that are negatively affected. Any sentence more than a week long causes your character to lose advancement towards every skill.

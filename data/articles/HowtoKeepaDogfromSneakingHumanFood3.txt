 Many dogs will try to sneak human food when hungry. To remove this factor, make sure you follow a regular feeding schedule for your pup. Feed your dog at the same time in the morning and at night. Give your dog treats on a regular basis and make sure its water dish is always full of fresh water.Balance out the feeding schedule with an exercise routine. Walk your dog regularly so they work up an appetite and make sure you feed it after a long walk so they do not go hungry.
 To ensure your dog is not trying to sneak food due to hunger, give the dog its food before you serve human food. Prepare its breakfast or dinner before you make any human food. Make sure they eat first so they do not beg or sneak any of your food due to hunger.
 To keep your dog occupied while you eat, give it a bone or a larger treat to chew on. You may have your dog perform an obedience trick first, such as “go to your place” or “lie down.” Then, you can reward it with a treat while you focus on your meal.

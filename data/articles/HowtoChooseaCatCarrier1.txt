 Carriers that are too big will cause your cat to tumble about as your transport it. This is very uncomfortable and unsafe for your cat. On the other hand, your cat my feel cramped inside a small carrier, which may increase the anxiety it is already feeling.It is also hard to balance large carriers as you transport them, especially if your cat is inside.;
, Your cat should be able to lie down, stand up and turn around easily in the carrier. If not, then the carrier is too small.For example, if your cat is 10 inches (25 cm) tall and weighs 10 pounds (4.5 kg), then choose a 25-inch (65-cm) tall carrier that can hold 25 to 30 pounds (11.3 to 13.6 kg).
If you plan to travel with your cat, make sure the carrier can comfortably fit your cat and its food and water bowls inside.
 Even if your cat is a kitten, choose a carrier that will be the appropriate size for your cat when it reaches adulthood. While your cat is a kitten, line the carrier with a thick blanket or towel. This will prevent your kitten from sliding in the carrier as you transport it.

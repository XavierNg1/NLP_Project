 Press and hold the Windows key and press R. A small box should pop up in the lower left-hand side of your screen. Type “CMD” into it and then hit Enter. A small black window will appear; this is CMD.
 CMD is run through a command line. You need to enter specific commands to start changing anything. One cool command to start with is the “color” command. The color command has the power to change the way to look at your current CMD display. For instance, if you type “color 0a,” your text will turn green and your background will stay black. If you would like a complete list of colors and how to use the command further, type in “color /?”.
 Inside the CMD window, you should see a blinking underscore. When you start typing, this is where you will be able to see your command being entered. Enter the command you want to use to change the text color. Once you have finished typing the command, go ahead and hit the Enter key, and the command will run.


When you are all done, your settings should be completely saved, so the next time you run CMD you should see the the new colors you set.
Placing the switch “/?” at the end of any command will give you the help file for that command. This should include all switches and the syntax of the command.
 If you’re not satisfied with the color changes you made and would like to return everything to default, simply go into Properties again, and on the “Options” tab, check the box on the bottom next to “Use legacy console,” Then relaunch CMD. The color of the text may be the same still, but just enter “color 07,” and hit Enter. It should return to black background with white text.

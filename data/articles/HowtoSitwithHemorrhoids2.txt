 Using the toilet often reveals the presence of hemorrhoids, by way of red blood in the water or on your bath tissue. Sitting on the toilet is also one of the major causes of hemorrhoids, especially if you spend a lot of time there or strain while defecating. The quicker you can get on the toilet, have a bowel movement, and get off, the better.Don’t linger on the toilet unnecessarily, for instance by finishing a chapter in your bathroom reading material of choice or playing on your phone.
If your toilet routine takes more than a few minutes because of regular constipation, look into methods of relief like drinking more water, eating more fiber-rich foods, and taking fiber supplements and/or stool softeners.
Also, “when you gotta go” — use the toilet right away. “Holding it in” can cause or exacerbate constipation.
 Sitting causes increased pressure on the veins in and around your anus, and these stressed veins are where hemorrhoids form. Try standing instead of sitting when watching TV, working at a desk (look for an adjustable model that allows you to both sit and stand), and at other times during your daily routine. It’s good for your health and your fight against hemorrhoids.When you do need to sit, take breaks to stand up and move around every so often. This can help prevent the pooling of blood that causes hemorrhoids, and can relieve some of the pain of existing hemorrhoids.
 Standing up instead of sitting is good for your health, and exercising instead of standing still is even better. Walking, dancing, gardening, or any other moderate-intensity activity will benefit your body in many ways — including possibly easing your constipation.Exercise can also help you lose excess weight, which will in turn decrease the pressure on the veins in your posterior when you sit down.

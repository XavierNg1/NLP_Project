 Any of these souls will do, just make sure you have the Undine soul and Skula soul as well. These will be necessary for getting you past certain barriers.;
, Since this level is comprised mostly of water, it is a must for you to have the Undine soul upon arriving here. The Undine soul will allow you to walk on water.
 The waterfalls will be straight ahead upon entering the underground cavern. You’ll know it’s the right room when you see a floating boat near the entrance.
 The idea here is to go past the waterfall. So, after equipping the Undine soul, equip either Manticore, Curly, or Devil Soul to trigger an ability that will let you go past the waterfall. Make sure you are not too far away from the waterfall when you activate this ability.
 As you make your way towards the waterfall, holding down the R button will allow you to go past it. This now gives you access to the secret passage where the powerful weapon is kept.


Don’t forget to pick up the Eversing just beyond the waterfall. This has the best defense when it comes to armor.
 This area is bordered by the Underground Reservoir and the Study. It is a tough area to find but after breaking through the waterfall, it is now time to unravel its secrets.
 Go deeper on into the Forbidden Area. After defeating a couple of enemies, you will then discover a ship. Locating a ship in the Forbidden Area means that you are now nearing the ultimate weapon you’re searching for.
 At the end part of the ship, you will find a ladder leading underwater. Equip the Skula soul to enable you to walk underwater.
 After defeating a couple of killer fish, you will eventually bump into a dead end as you go straight and to the right. Hit this wall with your weapon to break it.
 Upon breaking the wall, a secret path will appear that leads to the weapon. Go get the weapon at the end of the path. This weapon is called Claimh Solais. Enjoy!

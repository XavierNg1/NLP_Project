 The communications from a helmet or full facemask have been around for quite some time.  Several first-responder units use these, as well as certain other public agencies to help with underwater communication.
 Casio has a device that uses a "bone microphone" to communicate. Known as Logosease, the compact 3.8-ounce (108-gram) transceiver attaches to the mask’s retaining straps, resting against the side of the diver’s head.


Using bone conduction (the vibrations carry through the wearer’s skull), the microphone on the Casio is able to pick up what the diver is saying. Words will be a bit garbled because the divers have regulators in their mouths and plugs in their noses.
The system reportedly allows divers to communicate within visual range, a distance that varies wildly, depending on water conditions. The unit itself is watertight to a depth of 180 feet (55 meters); plenty for most recreational divers.
 Using these devices is like using 2-way radio communication protocol. Parties take turns speaking, and use clear, short sentences, indicating when they have finished and whether a response is expected.


Like radio, this is done to ensure that the message has a fair chance of being understood and that the speaker is not interrupted. When more than one recipient is intended, the caller will also identify the desired recipient by a call-up message, and will also usually identify him/herself.
The surface caller should also give the diver a chance to temporarily suspend or slow down breathing, as breathing noise is often so loud for the message to be heard over it.

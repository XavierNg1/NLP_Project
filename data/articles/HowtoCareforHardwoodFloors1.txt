 Microfiber mop pads are more effective than sweeping with a broom. They’re also safer, since some broom bristles can scratch the floor's surface.


When dusting with a microfiber mop, lift it off the floor as little as possible so that the dirt stays securely trapped on the pad.
Daily dusting is your best line of defensive against scratches and surface damage.;
, If you leave a lot of debris on the floor when you vacuum, this can scratch the floor’s surface. After using the microfiber pad, carefully vacuum the floor using a floor-brush attachment.


Use caution when vacuuming hardwood floors. Keep an eye on the vacuum’s wheels, which can damage the surface if you aren’t careful.
Never use a vacuum with a beater bar attachment, since this can scratch the finish on the floor.
 Do not dampen it with water. Instead, mist the mop head lightly with a cleaner made specifically for hardwood. Use the minimum amount of cleaner required to get the floor clean.


If your floor has protective sealant on the surface, check the manufacturer's recommendations before using a cleaning product.
Never wet-mop or steam mop a hardwood floor. Both can dull the finish and damage the wood.

 This practical method works well for any kind of socks, especially tube socks, and it is a great space-saving way of folding.








Again, find a pair of clean matching socks.
Lay the socks on a flat surface such as a table or an ironing board.
Place socks on top of each other and straighten them out with your hands.
Line up the socks together so that if you turn them to the side, it looks like you have 1 sock. The toes, heels and cuffs should all be lined up.
 Bring the cuff of the top sock about an inch down and inward, toward the other sock.









Start rolling the socks from the toes up by making sure to roll as tight as possible.
Continue rolling until you reach the top. The tighter the roll, the more compact and neat the socks will be.
Once the socks are rolled up, insert a finger inside of the outer cuff and pull the outer cuff over the top and around the rolled socks. Tuck any loose parts in.
Finally, the socks will look like tight little rolls.
 The hardest part will be keeping the roll tight and the socks lined up.









From now on you will be able to store socks in smallest of places.
Your travel bags will have more room to hold other items.
It is easy to throw in your bag an extra pair of emergency children’s socks when they’re rolled this way.

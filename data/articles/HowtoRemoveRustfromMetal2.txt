 Many different types of chemicals can be purchased to help dissolve rust. They are typically made from phosphoric or oxalic acid and can be harmful to bare skin. Always take precautions when using a chemical to dissolve the rust.









Follow the directions for your rust-removal product, as application may vary between products.
These chemicals often need to set for a long time and require scrubbing afterwards, so be ready for a little extra work.
These products can be expensive and only work for small-scale projects, not larger rusted items., Purchase a rust converter which works to stop rust from eating away any more of the metal. It is similar to a spray paint, and acts as a primer for a coat of paint over the top as well.









Although this stops rust from expanding, it may not be as effective as completely removing the rust from the metal.
This is only an option if you plan on painting over the metal. It will also leave a rough texture under the paint, as you are essentially just adding a covering to the rust.
 This method requires a lot more elbow grease, but you can effectively remove rust by simply scraping it off. Use tools from your garage like a screwdriver, or rent tools from a local hardware store.









Steel wool is easy to use and something you may already have in your home.
Use an electric sander to remove rust on large pieces. Always start with the roughest grain and slowly move to finer grains to minimize the roughness of the metal.
Any metal tool can be used to scrape metal, but use a fine grain sandpaper afterwards to try to remove any marks the scraping may have made.
 Buy a small box of citric acid in the powder form from your favorite supermarket in the baking/cooking goods area.









Put some citric acid in a plastic container and pour in hot water, enough to cover the item being cleaned. For fun you can watch the bubbles reacting!
Leave overnight then rinse and dry.

 Take an ordinary metal spoon and position it vertically, with the bowl at the lower end. Grip the lower half of the spoon with your dominant hand. Use your other hand to cover the top half of the spoon handle completely. It should look like the upper hand is gripping the spoon, but the thumb should not wrap around the handle.










The audience must be straight in front of you for this trick.
If you like, you can demonstrate the spoon is an ordinary spoon by rapping it against the table, or letting the audience handle it.;
, Place the tip of the bowl against the table and pretend to push hard. Push the spoon down with your lower hand so the audience can see the effort. Meanwhile, keep your upper hand in the same vertical position, but let the spoon fall backward. Let the spoon handle rest on the ring and little fingers of your lower hand.
 Show the audience your magic ability by "returning" the spoon to its unbent state. This can be as simple as running your hands over the spoon, then lifting it to show the audience. Just make sure the audience does not see the straight spoon while it is still supposed to be bent.

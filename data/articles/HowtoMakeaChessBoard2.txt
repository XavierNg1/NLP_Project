 You'll need tiles in two different colors. These should be 2x2" (or multiples of 2, such as 2x4" or 2x6"). You can buy these in sheets that you split up or you can buy them individually. Look for sample sheets or sale tiles to save money. You'll also need 1x2 lumber, 1/4" plywood, and glue. If you can only get 2x4" or 2x6" tiles, you'll also need a saw that can handle masonry. Talk to your local hardware store for advice.
 You'll need to cut a roughly 19x19" base from the 1/4" plywood. The size will depend on whether you are grouting your tiles or not.
 If your tiles are not already 2x2" square, then you'll want to cut them using an appropriate saw. If they are square but are apart of a sheet, you'll need to use a utility knife to cut them free.
 Measure and mark for the location of the squares on your base. Then, use grout or glue to secure the tiles to the wood. Let this set completely before continuing.
 Using a miter saw or miter box, cut and miter your frame (picture frame style) to fit around your tiles. You'll need to adjust the size, depending on whether or not you're using grout, but assuming that you are not then the inside measurement for the frame will need to be 16" and the outside will need to be 19".
 Paint or stain your frame, or finish it however you want to. Sanding first might help get a better look, depending on the wood you bought.
 Glue and then place your frame around the tiles.
 You can add any finishing touches that you want, like attaching shoe molding around the outer rim, in order to get a more finished look. Otherwise, enjoy your new chess board!

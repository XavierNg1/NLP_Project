 If you are naturally blonde or light, this shouldn’t be too hard and you can skip some of the steps. But if you’re naturally dark then follow these instructions word for word.;
, This will get rid of any color you have previously dyed your hair in the past, whether this be just the red you currently have, or a long list of other colors. I recommend 'color b4'. I used this for my already treated hair and it got rid of all the colors i had ever dyed it. If you have had a lot of strong colors in your hair, choose a higher volume. This should take you back to your natural color unless hair has been previously bleached. If your hair has already been bleached then it will most likely go to how it was then which is usually an orangey yellow color. After you have used this move onto the next step

, Follow instructions on bleach. If your hair is naturally blonde i suggest you skip this stage as your hair will most likely be light enough to dye already from the stripper.
 This will also help in cancelling out yellow tones caused by the bleach in order for the platinum or blonde to take place.
 And there you go!

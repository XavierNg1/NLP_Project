 Though uncommon, public lice have been known to survive on smaller children by clinging to their eyelashes. This usually occurs when children share a bed with parents or siblings who have contracted public lice.


Be aware that public lice on young children can be a sign of sexual abuse., Usually there are only a few lice on eyebrows or eyelashes, and they can be removed by plucking and flushing them down the toilet. Make sure you get everything to prevent reinfestation.


Lice are small, grey-brown insects that resemble crabs.
The eggs, or nits, are small white dots usually found at the base of the hair.
 Apply the jelly around the edges of the eyes 2-4 times a day. Be sure to get ophthalmic-grade petrolatum ointment, which is available by prescription, as Vaseline can cause eye irritation., These creams can cause permanent eye damage, and should never be used for cases along the eyes or eyelashes. Similarly, do not use creams for children unless directed by a doctor

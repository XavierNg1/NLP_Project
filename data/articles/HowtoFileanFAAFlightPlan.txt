,, The name of the airport can be used if you do not know the identifier code.
, If you plan on more than one cruising altitude, only list the initial altitude.
 Use NAVAID codes, airport codes, and airways as applicable. You do not need to enter the departure airport or destination as those are included in separate blocks. Start with the first checkpoint or instrument departure procedure followed by subsequent checkpoints. For example: DEPART3.ABC - V 23 - V 104 - XYZ Direct KSFO Direct XYZ - V 84 - INTSC

,, For example: 1 + 30 min

, Such as the registration number if using a designated call sign. If you are flying IFR and do not wish to use a published departure procedure, write NO DP in this section. Note you will still need to fly the obstacle departure procedure for the airport if the weather is below VMC (Visual Meteorological Conditions) to ensure terrain clearance.
, For IFR flights, you are required to list an alternate if, for your destination airport one hour before and after your estimated time of arrival, the ceiling is forecast below 2,000 feet (609.6 m) or visibility less than 3 miles (4.8 km). Remember the 1-2-3 rule (±1 hr, ceiling 2000 ft, visibility 3 mi).
 This information will help in the event of a search and rescue mission.
,,, Flight plans may also be filed on-line through a number of services including DUATS.
 The frequency can be found on a VFR or IFR chart and in the airport facility directory. IFR flights should contact departure or center on the appropriate frequency

, IFR flights are closed automatically upon arrival at airports with towers.

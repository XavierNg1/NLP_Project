 A two-year old steer would produce an average of 450 pounds of meat. There are at least 50 types of cattle used in butchering to produce beef for the consumer's table.


Major cattle used for human beef consumption include Angus, Hereford, Charolais, and Brahman. The Angus cow is famous for being from Scotland and is seen on many a cattle ranch.
One of the most commonly raised cattle in the United States is the Hereford cow. The Hereford cow is known for producing well marbled meat much akin to the Black Angus cow. Charolais cattle are primarily used to breed larger calves. A Charolais bull is often crossed with a Hereford cow to produce a larger calf leading to higher beef yield.
Brahman cattle are akin to wild cattle and are rarely used in US ranching. ,



Calving: Calves are typically born in the spring usually during the last blizzard of the year. Calves may have to be "pulled" if the calf is too large for the cow giving birth.

Genetic Diversity: Most ranchers usually keep one "papered" bull per 50 cows to promote genetic diversity. A "papered" bull is one that has documented lineage. Branding: Branding is typically done in the spring when calves weigh between 200 to 300 pounds. Vaccinations for Black Leg are given and the cow is branded and given an ear tag. Ear tags are considered a separate form of identification. Bulls are castrated during branding and become a Steer. All cattle with horns except Bulls are de-horned during branding.
 Veal is from beef cattle. Veal comes from calves weighing approximately 150 pounds and is less than 3 months old. Veal is milk fed and the meat is pink in color.

 A torrent is a program that takes bits of video and information from all over the internet and compiles them on your computer for you.


Using torrents is illegal because it violates the copyright laws in place for films and videos.
Try using www.utorrent.com, deluge-torrent.org, or vuze.com for free torrent downloads.
 These sites pirate complete films and videos from all over the internet and allow you to stream them for free. The aptly named PirateBay is a good site to search for your favorite movies.

 If everyone is wearing those pony tails or side-swept bangs, that's everyone else. You are an individual. Go with a comfortable easy, cute hairstyle. Perhaps, more unique than those other girls.
 Learn cute and easy hairstyles, or use a wig for a day or two, or try temporary hair dyes.
 Eat right. No one wants to be fat, but don't try too hard to be a "size 0 or 1" like anyone else. Stay healthy looking by being fit and active. You can be healthy and be a larger size than the typical person in an advertisement.

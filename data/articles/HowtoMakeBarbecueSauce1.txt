 Place in the microwave and cook on high heat for 2-3 minutes until the butter is melted and the onion and garlic have softened.;
, Add in the ketchup, cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, paprika, chili powder, salt and pepper. Stir well to combine.
 Remember to stir the sauce once or twice throughout cooking to ensure even heating. The sauce is ready when it becomes hot and thick.


Alternatively, you can cook the barbecue sauce by heating it over a double boiler - just bring a saucepan of water to the boil and sit the glass bowl containing the sauce on top.
 Remove the sauce from the microwave, being careful when handling the hot bowl. Stir the sauce thoroughly with a fork. If you wish to get rid of the onion chunks, you can blend the sauce with a little water in a blender or food processor.
 You can serve the sauce immediately, use it in your favorite recipe, or store it in a glass jar in the refrigerator.

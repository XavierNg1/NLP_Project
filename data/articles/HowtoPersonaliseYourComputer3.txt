 This can be found in the Control Panel, under Appearances and Personalization. Navigate to the Screen Saver option. This will open your Screen Saver Settings.
 Use the dropdown menu to choose from a selection of installed screensavers.
 You can adjust how long until the screensaver appears, and whether or not you want it to lock the computer. Depending on the screensaver you choose, you may be able to adjust settings for it by click the Settingsâ€¦ button.
 To install a new screen saver, you need to download one from the internet. Screen savers use the .scr format. Be sure to download screen savers only from trusted sources, because screen saver files are executable files and can be used for virus distribution.


To install a downloaded screensaver, simply right click on the .scr file and select Install from the menu.

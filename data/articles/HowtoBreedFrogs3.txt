 Frog farming for human consumption is not economically profitable in the United States right now.Most frog legs come from Bangladesh, Belgium, China, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, and Taiwan.They are often harvest wild there due to the difficulty of intensive frog farming.Be wary of “get rich quick” schemes based on farming frogs for human consumption.Focus instead on producing frog legs for personal or small-scale enjoyment.
 You may need to purchase a wildlife breeder’s permit in order to raise frogs.Be sure that your frog farm does not violate local zoning laws or disturb protected species or wetlands.
 Edible frogs include the green frog (Rana clamitans), the leopard frog (Rana pipiens), the pickerel frog (Rana palustris), and the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana). The bullfrog is the one most often farmed for food in North America., Many frog farms are natural marshes or ponds that have been modified to limit predators, retain frogs, and allow for easy supplementation of food and capture. Set up a fence to protect the area.An adult bullfrog needs about twenty feed of shoreline for its feeding territory. Increase the available shoreline by building inlets, coves, and islands.
Ensure that the water is deep enough to protect the frogs and tadpoles from extreme temperatures. In areas with cold winters, six to twelve feet may be required to allow for hibernation in the bottom mud.
 Don’t feed them the remains of butchered frogs, because this might transmit disease., Paying for a supply of live minnows, crayfish, and insects to feed your frogs will be one of the most expensive aspects of a frog-farming operation. However, frogs generally refuse to eat food that is not moving.Use a strong night-time light at outdoor farms to attract flying insects.
 Many diseases arise from over-crowding; be sure to allow plenty of room for your frogs. If you see evidence of disease, isolate affected individuals and treat them with antibiotics.

 There are quite a few cities that you can visit to find a spell merchant. Cities like Morthal (North of Whiterun), Solitude (northwest of Morthal), and Winterhold (northeast of Morthal) are some of the places you can visit.


Large towns like Whiterun—the first town you’ll find yourself in once you start the game—and Riften (southeast-most corner of the map) also has a spell merchant residing inside.;
, Each city or town has its own castle or town hall, respectively. These buildings are very easy to find since these are the largest structures in the area and are watched by guards (though the main character is free to enter anytime).
 Once you’re inside the city’s castle or town hall, head further inside until you see the Jarl’s throne (which is right in the middle).


Jarls are the leaders of each city or town that reside inside the castle or town hall.
 Once you get to the Jarl’s throne, look around if you see any non-playable character that wears a hooded robe. You’ll often find one right beside or not too far from where the Jarl is—often located inside the rooms right next to the Jarl’s throne.


Spell merchants are mages in nature; they wear a hooded robe of any color, without any armor whatsoever, regardless of their race (Dunmer, Elf, Man, etc.).
 That character will start to ask if you want to buy some spells or books.


Other spell merchants, like those in Winterhold, will tell you a short story first before asking you to buy some items.

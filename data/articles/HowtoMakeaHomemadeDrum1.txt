 For this method, you will need an empty cylindrical container, electrical tape or masking tape, construction paper, crayons or colored pencils (optional), two pencils (optional), and tissue paper (optional).


For the container, you can use a coffee container, a popcorn tin, or an aluminum can. This is going to be the base of the drum, so look for a container that is clean and in good condition.;
, This is going to form the top of the drum, which needs to be sturdy and firm.


Try to put at least one to two layers of tape on the top of the can and criss-cross the tape tightly to make the drum more durable.
 Then, cut the construction paper so it will fit around the container snugly. Tape the paper in place and trim away the excess paper.
 Or, let your little one decorate the drum using markers, crayons, or paint.


You can also cut out shapes from other construction paper and attach them onto the side of the drum.
 Crumple up a piece of tissue paper on the end of a pencil. Wrap masking tape or electrical tape around the tissue ball so it is secured to the pencil.


Repeat this method on another pencil.
 Now it is time to have some fun with your drum or let your toddler play with it to make sure it will withstand a drumming session.

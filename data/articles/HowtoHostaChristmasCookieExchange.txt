 With just a little planning, and very little effort, it can be a secret strategy for getting ahead on your holiday baking and ending up with a Santa-sized platter of fantastic cookies in all sorts of tempting varieties.;
, December is a busy and hectic month for most people. For best results, aim for 8-12 confirmed guests. Ask your guests to RSVP as soon as possible, and to let you know what type of cookie they will be bringing. This way you can avoid the dreaded cookie duplication and make sure that their choice fits the exchange.
 Typically you should ask each guest to bring either a dozen or half dozen cookies for each guest, plus a dozen to nibble on at the party.
 Whether you are a host or a guest, you should always try to bake a show-stopping holiday treat. Choose a delectable cookie that is sweet, tasty & pretty. Make yours an impressive melt-in-your mouth treasure that everyone else wants to bring home.
 It could be a story about the cookie's origin, where the recipe comes from, or just a holiday baking memory. Sometimes itâ€™s as much fun trading stories as trading cookies.
 Your friends may have recipes they wish to share, so once the tasting ends, continue the celebration in another delicious way. Be sure to request that each guest bring along copies of their recipe, and put them right on the table next to their cookies. As an added treat, you may even want to assemble a booklet of recipes for everyone to take home with them.

 You want a pot that's large enough for your potatoes to be well covered with water and not to be too cramped. Aim for at least 1 or 2 inches (2.5 - 5 cm) of water on top of the potatoes.
 You may find that the skin comes off easier (or at the very least, is easier to grip) with the potatoes scored. Just make a line into the skin (only about ¼ inch deep (.6 cm) around the center of the potato, like an equator.









Don't make the cut too deep; it just needs to go past the layer of skin. Try to cut every potato evenly so each one cooks evenly, too.
 A good-size pot with 6 or 7 potatoes will take around 15 minutes to cook through. You’ll need more or less time depending on how many you’re dealing with. When you think they’re done, pierce one with a fork – if it punctures the skin and then slides right in, you’re good to go.









Don't even worry about draining the pot just yet – move right onto the next step so the potatoes' heat is preserved.
 Have a bowl of ice water ready for when your potatoes are done. With your tongs (do not touch the potatoes directly), grab each potato and put it in the bowl of ice cold water.









They don’t need to be left in there for too long to cool down – 5 -10 seconds is plenty.
With each potato, you may need to add an ice cube or two to the water; the heat of the potato will likely have transferred.
 Here’s the magic: with just your fingers applying pressure to the skin, it will come right off, like a tablecloth. If you've scored the potato, place your thumbs on this line and pull toward the end of the potato, leaving a skinless potato in your wake.









Dispose of the skin one by one in the garbage (or in a designated bowl next to you), to keep the bowl of ice water clean and as cold as possible.

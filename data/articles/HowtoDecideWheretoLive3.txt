 Move to a place that you can afford, but that also provides you with the opportunities you want. Your money will go much further in some regions than it will in others. On the other hand, the jobs that you'll find in a more expensive area will also typically pay you more. This is the dilemma: the places with the most opportunity are often the most expensive to live, and the most affordable places are often less conducive to building a career.Do not let money be the only deciding factor. Yes, you should move to a place where you'll be able to support yourself and you family. First and foremost, however, you should be excited about where you're going.
 Factor your current and future career into the equation. Consider searching for jobs in potential new cities just to get an idea for what's out there. Look for areas that feature a lot of jobs in a field that interests you.If you plan to keep your current job, then it may not be feasible to move somewhere that involves a lengthy commute.
 If you will be moving with children or expecting children, then research which areas have the best opportunities for schooling. Imagine how the culture and opportunities of a given area will impact the way that a child grows up. Pick a place that will provide a nurturing and stimulating environment for your children to call "home."


Think about the sort of support system that will be available. It can be much easier to raise children, both financially and logistically, if you are living near a network of family and close friends.
If you homeschool your child, make sure to look into homeschooling groups for a given area. Some regions are much more friendly to homeschoolers then others.

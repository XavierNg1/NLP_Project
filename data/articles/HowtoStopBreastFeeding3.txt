 Weaning is a different process for every baby. It may take a few months before the baby is able to take a cup or bottle without complaint. In the meantime, don't give up; stick to the routine you've set up, and continue gradually replacing feedings for as long as it takes.

Know that your baby may need extra comfort when he or she is sick. It's fine to revert to breastfeeding during times like these.
Having the baby spend extra time with a father, older sibling, or another relative can help. As the baby's relationships with other people grow, he or she won't be as reliant on breastfeeding with you to be the sole source of comfort.
 Sometimes the transition from breastfeeding can result in medical complications. If you're not sure whether weaning is the healthiest choice for your child, it's best to see a doctor right away. Look for the following issues that commonly crop up during weaning:


The baby refuses to eat solid food even though he or she is over 6 or 8 months of age.The baby develops dental cavities.
The baby focuses only on you and breastfeeding, and doesn't seem interested in other people or activities., As the baby drinks less breast milk, your breasts will start producing less. However, there may be times when your breasts become uncomfortably engorged or inflamed. Try the following techniques to make yourself more comfortable:



Express a very small amount of milk, either by pump or manually, during missed feedings. Do not empty your breasts, or that will signal your body to make more milk.
Apply a cold compress to your breast 3 or 4 times per day, for about 15 to 20 minutes at a time, if you need some additional relief. This helps relieve inflammation and constricts the milk-producing membranes.

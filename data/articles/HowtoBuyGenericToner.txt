 Manufacturers do usually offer generic toner cartridges for the latest generation of printers. If your device is older, the selection may not be quite as wide, but there is still a good chance that at least a couple of companies produce generic versions of the cartridges you need.;
, In spite of what some manufacturers would have you think, overriding protocols so a particular make and model of printer will recognize a generic toner cartridge is not always easy or possible. Do some investigating to identify if other owners have been able to successfully substitute a generic cartridge for the name brand recommended by the printer manufacturer.
 Many office supply retailers will offer house brands or some variation of generic brands for toner cartridges. There are also a number of online retailers who sell generic cartridges for a fraction of the cost of the name brand toner products.
 Once you have a list of potential products compiled, spend some time online finding out what others have to say about each of the generic products. Make note of any recurring issues that seem to appear with any of the generics, such as fewer printed pages per cartridge, difficulty with recognition of the cartridges by the printers, and any other comments that indicate inferior quality. Also look for reviews that indicate which generic toner cartridges offer benefits similar to or even better than their name brand counterparts, and focus your attention on those products.
 Balance the price with what you learn about the quality. Doing so will increase the chances of buying generic toner that provides everything you need while still saving money.

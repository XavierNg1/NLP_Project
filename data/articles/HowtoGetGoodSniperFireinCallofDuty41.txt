 There are two basic types of snipers: Camp snipers and Mobile snipers. You can use whatever strategy you want, but these two categories are the mother and father of snipers.



M40A3 Recommended






Pros: High Power and Accuracy, Low Recoil. Cons: MUST be used with stopping power if not in HC.



M21 - Recommended for Hardcore Variants






Pros: Semi-Auto, Good Accuracy, Low Recoil, Can be used in CQB situations. Large headshot hitbox.
Cons: Low-Medium Power, Most players will become agitated upon being killed by the M21



Dragunov






Pros: Semi-Auto, Medium-High Power. Large headshot hit box.
Cons: Medium recoil makes some players uncomfortable when attempting to land a followup shot.



R700






Pros: High Power and Accuracy
Cons: Medium-High Recoil, 4 bullet magazine compared to 5 on the M40A3. 1 shot kill is as unlikely as the M40A3 when not using stopping power.



Barrett .50cal






Pros: Semi-Auto, High Power, Large magazine, highest bullet penetration in the game. Combining this and Deep Impact will allow you to hammer through walls. Looks and sounds amazing.
Cons: Kicks up and to the right like a mule. Highest recoil in the game.

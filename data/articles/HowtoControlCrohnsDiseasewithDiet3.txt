 While food has nothing to do with the actual pathogenesis of the disease, certain foods may aggravate your symptoms due to their effects on digestion, absorption and allergy. These depend on which part of your bowel is affected and your particular sensitivity to different foods (food allergy); therefore, your diet should be absolutely individualized and custom made. No single diet will do the trick for everybody. Try this online food tracker and app, specifically for Crohnâ€™s disease., This is particularly helpful during a flare up. At the end of each day, note down every food item you consumed under the corresponding day/date. Also, note the symptoms of Crohn's disease you experienced that day. For example, you may write: three loose bowel movement, mild/moderate/severe cramps, feeling of abdominal gas, bloating for two hours, nausea etc. After two to three weeks you should be able to identify any food items that trigger your symptoms., Next, try to avoid one item from your diet (which you suspect is a trigger for your symptoms) at a time for one or two weeks while keeping your food and symptom diary.If you feel no change, that particular food is unlikely to be causing your symptoms. Start avoiding another item for a further one or two weeks. This way, you will most likely find your trigger foods by a process of elimination., Finding your trigger foods does not mean you need to avoid them completely. Total elimination may lead to deficiency of particular nutrients. Rather, you may try different methods of preparing those foods like steaming, boiling or stewing. Familiarize yourself with some common triggers. Common food items include: dairy products, uncooked vegetables, fresh fruits, breads, cereals, nuts, coffee, tea, carbonated drinks, prunes, beans, fatty foods, etc.


Keep in mind that every person with Crohn's disease is different and what works for you may not work for someone else.

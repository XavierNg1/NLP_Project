You can peel the eggplant if you prefer, but you can also leave the skin on.Cut the eggplant to the shape you need for your recipe, such as slices or cubes., You'll need a lot of salt for this process, so use more than you think you need, about 1/2 tablespoon for each (medium) eggplant. You can use regular table salt, kosher salt, or whatever you have on hand.Sprinkle the salt on, or toss the cubes in the salt. Spread the cubes out in a colander or over a cooling rack, as water will drip off them.A medium eggplant is about a pound by weight. If you're eggplant is larger or smaller, adjust the amount of salt in the same ratio. For instance, if you have an eggplant that is 1 1/2 pounds, add 3/4 tablespoon of salt for each eggplant.
 This process takes time, as the salt is drawing moisture out of the eggplant. You'll need 30 minutes at the minimum, but you can leave them up to an hour and a half. Watch for moisture beading up on the eggplant, which is what you want., Run the eggplant under water for a minute or two, making sure you get most of the salt off. Leaving too much salt on will make the final dish too salty., For most applications, you want to dry the eggplant off as much as possible. Place the eggplant between two paper towels, and press it down on a hard surface with your hand, which will remove much of the water. Use immediately.

 Since the bloom points down, you will need to get under it.
 Not shooting macro, but fill the frame with the lily., This will help you get the subject lit without blowing out the white.

If you are shooting close up, you will want to have a somewhat limited depth of field. Try starting with an aperture of 5.6 and adjust from there. Depending on the conditions, you will also need to vary the light. Take your time and keep trying different set-ups until you are satisfied with the results. The extra time you take in getting the shot right will show in the finished result.

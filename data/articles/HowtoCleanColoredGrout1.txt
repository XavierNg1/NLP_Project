 Steam cleaners use heat and high pressure to get rid of debris. However, if your grout is very old or damaged, you should avoid using a steam cleaner because it may cause further damage. Heat the steam cleaner and then move the cleaning wand along the surface of the grout lines to get rid of any dirt and debris., It is best to try mild solutions first, since they are least likely to damage your colored grout. Start by trying vinegar or baking soda. If that doesnâ€™t do the job, you can move on to hydrogen peroxide, which will work with moderate levels of grime. If your grout lines are really grimy, you may need to use oxygen bleach. However, chlorine bleach should generally be avoided.Chlorine bleach will discolor your colored grout, so you should leave it in the cupboard. Instead, choose either hydrogen peroxide or oxygen bleach.
If your colored grout is dirty around dishwashers or sinks from hard-water deposits, you can use a vinegar solution. In a spray bottle, pour an equal amount of vinegar and water. Spray a bit of the solution on the grout lines. Then, scrub the grout lines with your grout brush.A good alternative to vinegar for mildly dirty grout is baking soda paste. Add some water to baking soda to make a paste. Then, apply the paste to the grout lines and scrub with your grout brush., Although oxygen bleach does a great job on colored grout, it will eventually wear the color down because of the chlorine.The main advantage of oxygen bleach is that it requires very minimal scrubbing and does not produce fumes. You can find it at most home, hardware and cleaning supply stores.

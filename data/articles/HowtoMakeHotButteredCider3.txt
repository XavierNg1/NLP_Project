 Aside from the all but mandatory cinnamon sticks, there are several other spices that you can use to enhance your enjoyment of hot buttered cider. Whole cloves and grated nutmeg are especially aromatic. Dried anise seeds are another good option., Feel free to be as creative as you want with the recipe. There are all sorts of potentially enjoyable additions you can make. For instance, for a sweeter beverage, mix in a bit of maple syrup. For a batch with a citrus kick, zest lemon into your batch just before serving.
 Especially if you make a sweeter batch of hot buttered cider, such as a rum cider with maple syrup, a salt rim can add another level of flavor and visual appeal. Rub a lemon slice upon the rim of the glasses you'll use and dip the edges in salt.

 Income earned between the start of the year and the date of the person's death should be reported on the final tax return. Any income earned after the person's death is considered the estate's income, and if it's more than $600 you will also need to file a tax return for the estate (Form 1041, Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts).
 List income, exemptions and deductions just as you would for yourself. You can itemize deductions on Schedule A that the deceased person incurred before death, but none that occurred after. If you choose not to itemize, you can take the full standard deduction.The form must be filed on or before April 15 of the year following the person's death.


If the decedent didn't file taxes in the years preceding his or her death, you may have to file individual incomes for those years as well. Look for IRS correspondence in the decedent's personal records or look through the person's checkbook for evidence of refunds or payments to the U.S. Treasury.
If the decedent is due a refund, claim it using Form 1320, Statement of a Person Claiming Refund Due a Deceased Taxpayer., Include the decedent's name and the date of death. You will also write the word "deceased" (or, if you're the spouse, "filing as surviving spouse") in place of the person's signature at the bottom of the form. This will make it immediately clear to the IRS that the tax form is being filed for someone who is deceased.

 Use a body scrub the morning before you want to cover up your stretch marks. Try a body scrub made with caffeine. This may make your skin appear tighter and smoother.;
, Try a leg and body cover up cream. There are a number of cover ups on the market that will cover up stretch marks and other lines that detract from healthy-looking skin. No one has the exact same skin, so you may have to try a few products to see which is best for you.


Choose a color that will match your skin tone. Remember that it may be lighter or darker than your face makeup.
Choose a body cover up that includes sunscreen if you are regularly exposed to sunlight. Sunburns reduce the elasticity of your skin and make stretch marks more noticeable.
If you donâ€™t have access to leg and body cover up, use a primer moisturizer or a waterproof concealer. Choose a concealer with green undertones to cover up red marks. , Dip a flat foundation brush into the cover up product. Dab it gently onto the areas with stretch marks. Aim to use a very light layer of makeup. Assess the coverage that you get with a single layer. Layer the makeup in thin coats until you achieve the desired effect. It will quickly be obvious to you if it is working.


If you are going to wear a swimsuit, put it on before you apply makeup.
Use a powder brush to apply setting powder. Leave the powder a few minutes before changing into a short skirt or shorts.
A spray-on makeup fixative will also work to set the cover up or concealer.

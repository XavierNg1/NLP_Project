 The very best time to divide daylilies is late summer after they have finished blooming.;
, Loosen the soil and dig a hole deep enough to cover the base of the new clumps. Daylilies grow well in almost any soil in the full sun.
, Dig all the way around and under the daylily clump. Remove the clump from the ground completely.
 This will help you to see where to make your divisions. The best places to divide are areas where the foliage is weak.
 Make other divisions with a garden fork or a small garden spade to suit your needs. You can keep the divisions larger, or you can further divide into individual fans. The fans can then be planted close together to fill in areas of your garden.
 This step is not necessary, but it will make the plants easier to handle.
 The hole needs to be a few inches larger than the clump, but not too deep. Cover the area around the plant with soil. Be careful not to cover the crown of the plants with too much soil. Pat the soil down around the plants.
 The mulch will keep grass from growing around the plants, and it will help to hold in moisture.
 Keep the plants watered through the coming weeks.

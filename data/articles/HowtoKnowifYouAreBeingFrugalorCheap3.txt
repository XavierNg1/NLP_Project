 Making the best financial decision you can is certainly a laudable goal. However, this does not mean you should always buy the least expensive option. For instance, you may be able to get an especially inexpensive new laundry machine. However, the model that costs $150 more may wind up lasting several years longer, and cost you less in energy and water consumption, making it a much less expensive long-term purchase., Used items are often a great way to be frugal without getting stuck with a cheap, low-quality item. For instance, you can probably find great used furniture that is in good shape but costs less than brand new cheaper options that won't last as long.Buying used doesn’t work for everything. You may be able to find a great suit jacket at a thrift store, for instance, but those dress shoes with the worn-down heels probably aren’t worth the cost, even if they are cheap.
 One great way to save a buck without settling for the cheapest option is by buying a high quality item in last years model. This is especially worthwhile for items like sports equipment and some personal technologies., When you walk into a store, do you walk right to the back to check the clearance rack? It's a good idea, as you may be able to find what you're looking for on sale. However, it’s still worth checking the cost of items you might prefer that aren’t discounted.For instance, it might make sense to buy the pair of jeans that are actually your size and only cost a bit more than the clearance jeans that are a bit too tight.
 Sure, it’s best to get the best deals. That said, it’s not worth driving to three different grocery stores to save $0.67 on one item and $1.20 on another. Keep in mind that there is more than simple cost to account for, and that things like your time and stress level have value.

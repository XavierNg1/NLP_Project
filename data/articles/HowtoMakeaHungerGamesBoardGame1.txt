 Each player will need to have a game piece that they will use to move around the board. You can use everyday household objects as game pieces (such as coins, beads, etc.) or to get really creative, you can make your own DIY board game pieces using pictures of characters from the Hunger Games.
 During the game, players will be receiving damage from attacks and receiving objects from the Cornucopia. Before the game starts, you'll want to make a chart to track both the damage and the Cornucopia objects:


Damage: Write the name of each player down, then write down all the potential damages each player could suffer (these are listed below). When a player is hit, indicate with a check mark where the damage occurred. Note that each successful attack only counts for 1 hit. It's essential to keep track of damage, as this will indicate when a player is dead and out of the game.

Cornucopia: Players will also be receiving different objects from the Cornucopia that will give them advantages during the game (these are also listed below). Each player can only receive 1 of each type of item from the Cornucopia, so it's important to track which player has which objects. Below each player's Damage tracker, write down the name of each object in the Cornucopia. When a player receives an object, put a check mark beside the object's name.
 To play the game, you will also need a 6-sided dice. To create the game, you will need paper, pencils, and markers/pencil crayons to color the map.

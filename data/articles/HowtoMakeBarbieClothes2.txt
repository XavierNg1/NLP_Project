 These could work for both male and female barbie dolls, depending on the pattern of sock you use.









Find an old sock (mid-calf height socks work best) and cut the foot portion off. Discard the foot part and turn the remaining section inside out. Starting at the bottom, cut up the middle until about 1.5 inches from the top.
Sew up the two seams from the incision you just made. To keep the fabric from fraying or splitting, use the zigzag pattern of sewing called serging.This will make two separate pant legs. Turn the pants back inside out for nice, sewn pants for your barbie doll. There will be a natural elastic waist created by the band at the top of the sock.
 This method works for both articles of clothing (both shirts and dresses); the difference between the two is simply the length of the sock.









Choose your sock (use a child's sock instead of an adult sock) and cut it to fit your design. If you're making a dress, simply cut off the sock several inches above where the foot portion begins. If you're making a shirt, cut 3-4 inches from the top.
Make the arm holes by cutting a small V-shaped hole into each side of the sock, just under the elastic band of the sock.
 This activity is perfect for quickly and easily replacing missing barbie clothes in a pinch.









This is an incredibly simple method to make a quick skirt for your barbies when needed. Find an old child or toddler's sock and cut it to the desired length. The length will obviously depend on how long or short you want your skirt to be (anywhere from 2-4 inches). The elastic material in the sock will allow the skirt to fit snugly to your Barbie's body with no extra steps necessary.

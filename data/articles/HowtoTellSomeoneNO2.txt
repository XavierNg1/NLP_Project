 One of the most unpleasant parts about being told no can be feeling that you or your request was not important to someone you trusted to ask. You can avoid making a person feel this by actively listening to what they have to say. You should know exactly what you are declining., Once you have listened to the request intentfully, you should quickly consider the consequences of accepting or declining the request. Decide if the request is something that you would be okay with doing, and then decide if it is something that you want to do. If the answer to either of these is no, explain that you probably aren’t the best person to help them., Asking something of someone else is often a difficult thing to do. You should never assume that a request is being made lightly. The other person clearly considers you to be capable of helping them in some way. This does not mean you should do it, but you should keep in mind that the other person is human and deserves to be told no respectfully., Some requests, like petitions, aim to gain as much support as possible from anyone willing to participate. Other requests are more intimate, such as asking for advice in a relationship. Knowing why you are being asked can help you say no in an appropriate way (e.g. "I don’t feel comfortable giving you advice about your ex because they are very different from my ex").

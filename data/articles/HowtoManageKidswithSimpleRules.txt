,, Keep an eye on sleepiness but make it clear that such loss is self-imposed and must be remedied through a sensible approach to bedtime. A child that learns to self regulate will not continuously look to others to set boundaries throughout life but will know how to do this for himself or herself, which is the sign of a good thinker and a good leader.
 Don't get into the nasty habit of watching the homework clock for your child. Your child needs to learn for himself or herself that there are consequences for goofing off and not doing the homework on time. Those consequences do not include parental fixes; expect the child to remedy his or her own tardiness or failure to produce work.
 If your kid gets big-mouthed with you, your spouse, etc. and/or continues to do so, then assign extra chores and/or take away privileges.
 Back talk is a reason to punish your child and have a family meeting.
 In addition, expect a gradually increasing load of household responsibilities to be executed by each child as they grow older. If chores are not completed on time, take away favorite toys or privileges. If chores are completed on time, give them back their privileges.
 If your children fail to secure a good grade, take away some favorite toys/privileges until they manage to secure a better grade.

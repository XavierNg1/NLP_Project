 With a regular bustle, the end of the train is folded up under the back of the dress. This creates the look of a bubble hem and a fuller back to the skirt.A regular bustle may not even be noticeable to others, as it will just be assumed that your dress has just has no train and a full skirt.


Regular bustles are usually easier to create on a skirt that is full but does not have a ton of tulle underneath, as the tulle would make it more difficult for the dress to fall naturally when it is bustled.;
, The tie should be positioned so that when your bustle is completed, your skirt hem will be just off the floor. You, or your seamstress, can sew this into the seam of the skirt so that it is not visible from the outside.
 The eye hook should be concealed as well as possible. There are many that look like lace or decorative beading, so don't settle for an eye hook that is too obvious.


Remember that the eye hook needs to be sturdy enough to hold up the train of your dress, so if your train is really heavy, be sure to attach a sturdy eye hook.
 You will probably need someone to help you with this. Attach the eye hook to the tie on the underside. This will make your hem bubble and your skirt look fuller. Straighten out your dress, making sure that the back of it is lying as it should.


You may need to have more than one point of attachment to make the bustled hem look natural. If in doubt, hire an experienced seamstress to make this bustle.

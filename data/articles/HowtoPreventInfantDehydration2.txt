 Fever, diarrhea and vomiting can also lead to dehydration. These situations will require that you offer your child additional fluids.


Instead of feeding every few hours, feed every half hour.
Encourage the baby to nurse more frequently if breastfeeding.
Offer more frequent bottles with smaller portions of milk if you are bottle feeding.
 If the baby is not eating solid food yet, offer no more than four oz. You can provide more water if you've already introduced the baby to solids. Dilute juices with water if your older infant drinks juice.You can also offer your baby an electrolyte solution such as Pedialyte, Rehydralyte, or Enfalyte.
 If your baby cannot feed properly, dehydration is a real risk. A baby's lips should be around the areola of the breast, not just the nipple. If you hear loud noises like air being sucked, the baby may not be able to get good suction on the breast. A professional can help diagnose and provide strategies to resolve nursing problems.
 Keep track of the number of dirty and wet diapers the infant produces per day and how much/how often the baby is feeding. Your doctor can use this information to evaluate whether the baby is getting enough fluids.

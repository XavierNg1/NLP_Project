 In the area, include a bed for resting, a shelf to put the kid's stuff, and some toys for free time in their cabin.
 Take the ideas into consideration.
 These might include making things out of paper, coloring, painting, and chalk. You might want to include sports or games such as duck, duck, goose or musical chairs.
 This is where all the campers will assemble when they are out of their cabins. This will be the place where you display the rules and schedule for everyone to see. You could use a living room but choose a room that is big and is an area that you have to walk through all the time.
 Then kids won't be in the middle of an activity and have to quit halfway. On your schedule include those things or just plan your camp till after the lunch/snack breaks.
 Take into account the attention span of some of the campers. If you are dealing with little kids, make the activities time span of a maximum of 25 minutes per activity. Give extra time for lunch and things like that.
 If you don't set the rules, you'll spend an half an hour on questions about what you can and can't do. Make sure you even cover the simplest rules. Separate into do's and dont's; that seems to be the easiest to understand.
 You need to make a sign on each cabin so they know what each room is. If it is a room that they are not allowed in, put a big circle with a cross through it on the door.
 Make it something interesting so that the kids will think it's the funnest thing ever.
 Put them in your meeting room. You can do opening things there and explain everything.
 Make sure that it's fun for them.

 Go to a historic building that has wood flooring and study how the floors have aged over time. When you age hardwood flooring, you want to copy from real aged floors.;
, Hand scraping takes time, but it will age hardwood flooring.


Test a small area. Different woods react differently to distressed flooring techniques. Walnut, pine, hickory, pecan and oak work well when you hand scrape them, but hardwoods, such as maple and teak, don't turn out as well with this method.
Scrape in the direction of the grain and avoid the knots in the wood. Scraping against the grain will make scratches that go the wrong direction.
Adjust the angle and the pressure of the scraping tool to produce the texture you desire. Distressing wood floors is an art form, so use your creativity to achieve the results you want.
 Wire brushes may add a grainy feel to the wood.
 Try tossing a ball across the floor so they may run and slide on the floor. Their nails will create natural marks on the floor that will add to the distressed flooring look.
 These tools may be used to create chips, holes and scratches that will amplify the aged look.
 Burn marks may add character to your distressed flooring.

 It only ever lowers your chances.;
, Logging on every day and staying on a while shows you enjoy the server and care about its development. This will also let the staff know that you are active.
 Try to be active on the forums. Active community members usually make the best Admins.
 As Admins interact with other users on a regular basis, kindness and empathy will go a long way in boosting your credentials.
 Admins are usually expected to be thorough with any and all rules of the server, so avoid breaking any and try to get to know all the rules the best you can.
 Experience is key in becoming an administrator, so don't expect to become one right away. There will likely be several other admins before you, so congratulate them.
 Admins have trouble nominating users they are yet to interact with, so get friendly with the staff and know them better. Try adding some of them on Skype.
 Don't lie just to look cool sometimes lies get out of hand. Just be yourself.

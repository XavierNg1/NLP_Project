 Different shades of red produce different shades of pink when mixed with white paint. Experiment with different reds as you go. In order to achieve the brightest, most lasting shade of pink, try Permanent Alizarin Crimson or Quinacridone red acrylics and mix them with Titanium White.Vermilion will produce a nice shade of pure pink.
Use of a brick red will produce a muddier pink, closer to a peach.
Darker reds such as Alizarin Crimson Hue make a pink color tinged with blue or purple, so they are good for shades such as magenta.;
, Take your canvas, paper, or mixing board. Squeeze out your red paint on top of it. This red will be turned into pink, so keep it in a separate area until you are able to judge what pink youâ€™ll get and how much you need.
 Near the red, place white paint. Start with a dab to save paint. When you mix it in with the red, you can always add more later if you need more to dilute the pure red color.
 Using painting tools such as a brush or knife, mix your white into your red. Start out with a little bit to determine what tint of pink begins to form. You can add more white to get a brighter and brighter tint, but every red has its own tint strength, so you'll eventually reach the limit to how pink you can make that particular red.








The darker the red you used, the more white paint you will need to lighten it to pink.
Try softening your pink with yellow to bring it closer to a peach or a salmon color.
Add blue or violet to bring the pink closer to fuchsia or magenta.

 Ditch the big belt buckles (uncomfortable to the dancer), and empty your pockets of potentially knee-gouging items (keys, cell phone, money clip).;
, Always extinguish your cigarette before getting a dance.
 If you're not interested in a girl, smile and say no thank you. A "maybe later" or "not right now" will get another offer later, and the worst crime you can commit is wasting a dancer's time.
 Remember that she is someones daughter, sister, girlfriend, etc. Respect her as a working professional. Would you want strangers coming to your office and groping you?

, Don't say or ask anything you wouldn't want said to or asked of the women you care about.
 Personal questions are anathema to most dancers.
 This is a woman who suffers all manner of solicitation, all night long. If she's interested, she'll let you know.
 Don't squirm, don't gyrate, don't try to dance along or do things to make your friends laugh. Not only will you annoy her, you could very well knock her over in her six inch heels -- your buddies will never let you live it down.
 And always wait for her to pull the elastic out.
 Time is money, and she'll appreciate your consideration. Plus, she'll come back if asked.

 Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a rare, but serious condition that affects only 4 â€“ 6% of women after giving birth. Although PPH is very rare, it remains the number one cause of postpartum death. As such, it is important for you to recognize the risk factors that make PPH more likely, as well as the symptoms of PPH., You are more likely to experience PPH if you have been diagnosed with any medical conditions that affect the uterus, conditions that affect the placenta, or conditions that affect the way your blood clots.Conditions that affect the uterus include: uterine atony, uterine inversion, and uterine rupture.
Conditions that affect the placenta include: placental abruption, placenta accrete/increta/percreta, and placenta pelvia.
Conditions that effect the way your blood clots include: von Willebrand disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and you are taking anticoagulants (warfarin, enoxaparin, etc.).
 A variety of other factors can place you at a heightened risk for PPH. Keep in mind, none of these conditions indicate that you will experience PPH (again, this condition is rare); they only signal that your risk is slightly increased.You may be at an increased risk if you experience:


Obesity
Long labor (lasting more than 12 hours)
Emergency c-section
Anemia
Pre-eclampsia or high blood pressure
PPH in a previous delivery
Uterine infections (endometritis)

, PPH is most likely to occur within one day of giving birth; however, it is possible for PPH to occur up to two weeks postpartum. It is crucial for PPH to be treated immediately, so contact your health care provider if you experience any symptoms.Symptoms include:


Heavy bleeding from the vagina that does not slow down or stop
Drop in blood pressure or symptoms of shock (blurry vision, chills, clammy skin, very rapid heartbeat, feelings of confusion, extreme dizziness or fainting)
Pale skin
Swelling and pain around the vagina and/or perineum

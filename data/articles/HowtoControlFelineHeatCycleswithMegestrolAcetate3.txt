 Read through the vet’s directions carefully and look over the prescription label as well. MA usually comes in tablet form in a variety of dosages. Make sure to give your cat the entire run of the medicine or it could cause additional side effects.It can be easier if you give the medication at the same time every day. If you skip a dose, do not double up the next one., Check with your cat's vet or a pharmacist before proceeding with this step. Then, get out two spoons. Place the pill in one and place the other on top, applying pressure until the pill is reduced into a fine powder. Carefully handle the spoons until you know where you want to put the pill powder. Try to use the medication as soon as possible after crushing.Another option is to use a pill cutter, often sold at pharmacies, to break it down into smaller pieces.
It is also a good idea to read the MA’s medication label to make sure that it is okay to crush or cut the pill before moving forward., Place your cat’s normal food portion in their bowl and mix the pill dust or pieces into it. Or, get some soft cat treats and place pill pieces into the center of each one. Watch your cat eat in order to make sure that they get most of the medication.To trick your cat into eating, try giving them a first treat without any medicine and then following this with the mixed ones.
 If your cat is docile enough, gently grab their jaws and open them. Hold them in this position while you drop the pill toward the back of their throat. Push their jaw closed and watch to make sure they’ve swallowed it successfully.Only try this method if you think that you can do so without hurting or scaring your cat.
 It may be tempting to delay giving your cat their medication, but stick closely to the dosage schedule agreed upon with your vet. Talk with your vet about what to do if your cat decides to eat only part of the pill.

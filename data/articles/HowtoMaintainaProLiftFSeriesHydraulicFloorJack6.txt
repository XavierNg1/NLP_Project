 With the Oil Filler Plug still removed from the reservoir, use the handle to pump the jack 6 to 8 strokes to bleed any air that is trapped in the hydraulic system.
 Once the plug is in place again pump the jack 6 to 8 strokes to force additional trapped air up into the reservoir.
 Again, remove the oil filler plug to allow the forced air from the system to escape.



CAUTION! The hydraulic fluid located inside the reservoir could very well be under pressure when removing the plug. Insure that proper safety equipment is used when performing this step to prevent injury. Also, take necessary steps to prevent loss of the Plug should the pressure eject it from the port.
 If additional fluid is required due to the evacuated air, refer to SECTION D: STEP #02 for the proper procedure.
, Pump the saddle to its fully-up position.

If the saddle will not raise, or partially raise then repeat the steps in this section or refer to the troubleshooting checklist.
If the saddle does raise to its designed height, repeat the steps in this section until no more air is heard escaping from the reservoir each time the Oil Filler Plug is removed.

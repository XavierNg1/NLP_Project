 Cleanse your skin thoroughly, wiping off any excess moisturizer. Dab your brows with translucent powder. The powder will give your makeup something to grip on to, allowing it to keep its definition and stay on longer.
 Use a small, angled brush dipped in brow powder or eyeshadow to very lightly sketch the shape of an eyebrow. You can use the pencil trick from method one to determine precisely where your brow should begin, arch, and end, or you can eyeball it.








Drawing very lightly will allow you to easily erase the shape of the brow if you've made a mistake.
You don't need it to be perfect--too precise an eyebrow won't look as natural., This is essential for drawing natural-looking hair. Keep a sharp point throughout the process, and make sure you sharpen when switching to your other brow.








Don't try this with an eyeliner pencil instead of a brow pencil--it will smear and rub off.
 Use light, upward strokes to draw little fake hairs on top of the shaded brow you already drew. This layering will help create a 3-D effect and make your brows look more realistic.








Use a cotton swab to soften the edges a little, giving your brows a more natural look., Dab a little more powder over your drawn-on eyebrows and finish with a makeup or brow sealing solution. The powder and sealer will ensure your brows don't smudge or get rubbed or sweated off during the day.









If the sealer is too shiny, use a brush to lightly dust translucent powder over the area, dulling the shine., As an alternative to using a pencil everyday, you can get your brows temporary tattooed on in a process called microblading. Hairlike strokes will be tattooed on to look like additional eyebrow hair. Consult a professional to ask about trying this process.

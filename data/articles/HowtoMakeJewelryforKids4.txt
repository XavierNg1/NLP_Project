 Use coated, colored wire and select a piece that is about 15 in. (38 cm) in length.
 Do not use the entire piece of wire, though. Wind the wire around the rock several times, just enough to secure the rock in place.
 Twist the ends tightly until the remaining wire is used up.
 Only wrap the twist around the pencil once in order to form a loop. Close the loop by squeezing it shut with a pair of excess wire.
 Since the loop is only the width of your pencil, there will likely be some excess wire hanging off of it. Cut this extra wire away, making it as short as possible to prevent it from scratching the child who wears the necklace.
 Make the piece long enough to fit over your child's head. You can choose brown leather cord for a natural look, or you can use colored leather cord for something a little more fun.
 The cord acts as the chain, and the rock becomes the necklace pendant. Tie the ends of the cord into a tight knot before giving it to your child.

 Where is the firing coming from? To find out, use the minimap––it tells you where your opponents are even without the UAV. If you see a chunk of your teammates on the left side of the minimap, chances are the enemy is on the other side. Use this knowledge to your advantage and situate yourself to be in prime position to get the first shot.;
, Much like driving you've got to pay attention to the entirety of your peripheral vision. Watch for dark corners and turns that would allow an enemy to get the jump on you.
 People don't look up. You can just shoot down on them. You should put a claymore on the stairs (or however you got up) so if they try to get revenge, they blow up.

You can ask questions and get answers from people who have ‘been there.’ Group therapy can also be helpful.

 Many people choose to treat anxiety with medication, often alongside therapy. While medication will not cure anxiety, it can help you to manage the symptoms you experience. Anxiety medication can be a short-term or long-term treatment. If you’re considering medication, see a psychiatrist or general practitioner familiar with prescribing psychiatric medications.Taking medications often means experiencing side-effects, which can be minor or severe. If you experience unpleasant side-effects, talk to your prescriber and consider changing your dosage or medication.

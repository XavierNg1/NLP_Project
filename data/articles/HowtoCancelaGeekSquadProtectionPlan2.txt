 Bring the receipt for the product and the GSP Plan, along with the GSP Plan contract, to Best Buy.


Your GSP Plan receipt will include your plan number, labeled as "GSP #."If you cannot locate the original receipts, call Geek Squad customer service (1-800-433-5778) or follow the instructions in this article for cancelling by phone., Tell the clerk that you would like to cancel your Geek Squad Protection Plan.


Don't be shocked if the clerk acts surprised or confused, or tries to talk you out of cancelling. Best Buy doesn't want customers to cancel GSP Plans, and workers who want to keep their bosses happy will try to prevent cancellations as well.
Remember, however, that you can cancel at any time for any reason. If you don't want to tell the clerk why you're cancelling, you don't have to. Show him/her the relevant section of your contract document if necessary (Section 10.b.II, page 7 at present)., The means of determining this amount, along with the actual cancellation date of your GSP Plan, will vary depending upon whether you paid in full or pay monthly.For plans already paid in full, you will receive a pro-rated refund for the time remaining on the GSP Plan, minus the amount for any services rendered. For instance, if you cancel after one year of a two-year plan, you will receive half of your payment amount back. If, however, you had a repair done, that can be deducted from your refund.
For plans that are paid monthly by credit card, you pay in advance for each month of service. Therefore, unless you happen to be right at the end of a payment cycle, your coverage will continue until the end of that cycle, then your GSP Plan will be cancelled.
 Ask for documentation that your GSP Plan is no longer in effect. Keep this document, along with a receipt for any refunded amount, until you are sure the cancellation has been made.


It may take 60 days for refunds to show up on your credit card.

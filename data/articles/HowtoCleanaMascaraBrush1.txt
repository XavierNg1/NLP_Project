 You may not need too much elbow grease to clean your brush if you do a little maintenance. Inspect your brush once a week to check for dried mascara clumps.Gently grip the bristles in the fold of a paper towel and wiggle it back and forth. This loosens the clumps and also spreads the bristles apart.;
, Put very hot (but not boiling--it may melt the plastic) water in a cup and allow your wand to soak for about five minutes. The brush should begin releasing clumps of mascara and the water will turn cloudy and gray or black.Pour out the dirty water and reuse the cup to continue cleaning your brush.
 Pour isopropyl (or rubbing) alcohol into the cup and allow your mascara wand to soak. You should see more product dislodging from the brush. Soak for about one minute.If the brush still doesn't look clean, soak your brush for another minute and see if any more product is released., The little plastic handle on the end of your wand may have gunk built up from the sides of your mascara tube. Insert the end of a cotton swab and run it over the threaded part of the handle that screws into the mascara tube and seals it.Removing the build-up from this part of the wand may help you get a better seal when you twist it closed on your mascara tube and may keep your mascara from drying out, giving it a longer life., Any lingering water or alcohol might dry out your mascara, so you want to make sure it's thoroughly dried. Use a paper towel to gently pat the bristles dry.If your hands are clean, you can run your thumb over the bristles to feel if they are still wet. You may see little droplets of water fly off the brush if it is not completely dry, and you should continue to dab the brush with a paper towel.

 This app resembles a light-blue "e" icon with a gold band on it., It's in the top-right corner of the Internet Explorer window., It's at the bottom of the drop-down menu., You'll do so in the text box below the "Home page" heading that's near the top of the Internet Options window.

Most sites will be in "www..com" format, though you should check your preferred site's URL to make sure it doesn't end in ".net" or ".org" instead.
If you'd rather use a blank tab as your home page, instead click Use new tab. You can also click Use default to use your computer manufacturer's website.
 Doing this will save your changes and apply them to Internet Explorer.

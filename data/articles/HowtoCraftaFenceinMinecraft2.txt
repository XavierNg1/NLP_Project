 You'll need a pickaxe in order to mine Nether Bricks. Since the Nether is a dangerous area, it'll be helpful to have a powerful pickaxe that allows for quick mining. Try to have an Iron pickaxe or better.


To craft an iron pickaxe, place a stick in the center of the grid and a stick directly underneath. In the top row, put iron ingots in each box.
 You can create Nether Brick Fences by using Nether Bricks. These can only be found in the Nether, which needs to be accessed through a Nether Portal. See Make a Nether Portal in Minecraft for instructions on creating a portal to the Nether.


The Nether is a tough area, so this should only be undertaken if you're well-equipped. Make sure to bring plenty of healing items. See Make Potions in Minecraft for a guide on crafting some healing potions.
 These foreboding structures are unmistakable as you make your way through the Nether. They generally look like bridges rising above the ground. You'll have the best chance to find one by traveling east or west. If you travel north or south, you may go thousands of blocks without seeing one.


Nether Fortresses are home to Blazes and Wither Skeletons, both of which drop valuable materials for other crafting projects.
 The main component of the Nether Fortress structure is Nether Brick. Use your pickaxe to mine it. You'll need at least six pieces to create a fence, though you'll likely want more for larger projects.


You'll get six Nether Brick Fences for every six blocks of Nether Brick you use, essentially meaning that every block is worth one fence. You'll need a multiple of six blocks to use the recipe, though.
 Once you have at least six blocks of Nether Bricks, you can start making your Nether Brick Fences. Fill the bottom two rows of the crafting table grid with Nether Brick blocks.
 For every six blocks you put into the crafting grid, you'll get six pieces of Nether Brick fence.

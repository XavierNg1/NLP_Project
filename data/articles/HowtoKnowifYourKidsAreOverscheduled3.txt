 If you as a parent feel stressed by your child’s schedule, it’s probable your child is as well. Take stock of your personal feelings about your child and their schedule. Are you tired of shuttling your kids around? Are you apprehensive about the next upcoming activity? If so, reevaluate your kids’ schedule.Even removing a single planned activity from each week can have a significant improvement on you and your children’s mental health. Continue removing activities until you find a healthy balance., Traveling from activity to activity takes time. Spending too much time in transit transporting your children to and from activities is generally a clue overscheduling is occurring. Be on the lookout for:


Increased gas expenses.
High mileage.
Frequent replacement and maintenance of things affected by mileage, like oil/oil filters, tires, and more., Trying to do too many activities can lead to scheduling conflicts. These can contribute to stress and negative self-image. Scheduling conflicts can also lead to you or your children feeling guilty over not being able to fulfill planned activities.Write down each scheduling conflict as it occurs or keep a log in your phone. If scheduling conflicts happen more than a few times a week, it’s time to reassess your child’s schedule.
 Do you have time to sit down with your family and share your day over a meal? If not, you could be accidentally sending a signal that keeping busy is more important than family and interpersonal time. When mealtimes are skipped for sports practice, dance rehearsals, and so on, consider removing some activities from your kids’ schedules.Meals on the go, especially those in the car, can set an unhealthy precedent. There’s nothing wrong with doing this occasionally, but doing it too frequently can indicate a need for fewer activities.

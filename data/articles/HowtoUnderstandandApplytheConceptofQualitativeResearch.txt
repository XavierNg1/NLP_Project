 This does not mean that it is not systematic and rigorous. Moving back and forth between the different levels can make it lengthy.;
, Make notes of some ideas as they come to mind. If the transcripts are too extensive, do not attempt to read them all at once. When your mind starts to wander or you become impatient or start to feel disinterested, it is time to pause. Refrain from reading the transcripts from the beginning of the document. When you start out, you are in peak form. If you always confine this energy to the first section of your data, you are more likely to exclude or overlook valuable information from later sections.
 This can be the most interesting, the shortest transcript or the one on top of the file. Go through it and ask yourself: What is this all about? Do not think about the content of the information, but focus on its underlying meaning. Write down your thoughts in the margin.
 Put similar topics together. Form these topics into columns that can be grouped as "Major topics", "Unique topics" and "leftovers"

,, An example of this would be: Feelings and emotional reactions ca be assigned the code F/ER. This is merely an example. The researcher will decide on which code suits him or her the best. In this instance a code basically serves as a tag or label. A code is a shorter way of identifying the theme/category in a transcription.
 Look for ways of reducing your total list of themes and categories by grouping the topics that relate to each other.
, This may become necessary if codes closely resemble each other and can become confusing and lead to misinterpretation when the data is being analyzed. You can now start on interpreting and reporting your research findings.

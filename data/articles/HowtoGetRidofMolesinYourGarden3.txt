 Thwart mole tunneling by digging an obstructive trench in your yard. Dig down about 2 feet deep and 6 inches (approximately 15 cm) wide to cover enough area to have an impact. Fill this trench with impenetrable material likes rock or concrete, or fill it with wire.








This is an effective but labor-intensive way to protect your flower or vegetable garden from moles.
 If you have a mole problem in your garden, it is likely that you have a large concentration of grubs, which moles eat. To prevent moles, get rid of their potential food source by spraying your garden with milky spore disease or beneficial nematodes, available online or in garden stores. Neither will harm your plants or lawn, but they will kill grubs that would draw moles to your yard., To prevent moles, consider getting a cat to walk around your garden. Cats are deterrents to rodents of all kinds and will dissuade moles (and other pests) from wandering into your yard. Before adopting or buying a cat, make sure that your backyard is securely fenced in and free of any plants that might be poisonous to cats if ingested.

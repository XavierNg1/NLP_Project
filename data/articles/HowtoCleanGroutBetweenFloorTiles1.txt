 Mix 3 parts of baking soda to 1 part water to make a thick paste. This versatile cleaner will work with all colors of grout, but vinegar can be harmful to some natural stones such as marble or limestone.


Apply the paste to the grout lines with your finger.
Although the baking soda isnâ€™t harmful, wearing rubber gloves can help prevent scratches or irritated skin from the abrasive grout and baking soda.;
, Spray the baking soda paste you applied with the vinegar solution. You should immediately see bubbling which lets you know the natural cleaning process has begun.
 The bubbling action is a chemical reaction between the baking soda and vinegar. The reaction generally lasts a few minutes. After the bubbling has stopped the chemical cleaning action is done.
 Use a nylon bristled scrub brush, or a toothbrush, to scrub along each grout line. Pay close attention to corners and edges to make these areas clean as well., Use a mop and plain water to remove the baking soda and vinegar residues. Rinse your mop and change the water often during the cleaning process so you do not continue to spread the residue around the floor.

 PDF files open natively in the Safari app. Tapping a link to a PDF file will display the PDF file in the browser.;
, When you're viewing the PDF in Safari, you can pinch to zoom much like you would any website. Move two fingers apart to zoom in, and move them together to zoom out.
 If you want to copy text from the PDF, press and hold the text on the screen. Release your finger when the magnifier appears, then drag the handles to select text.


Due to the way many PDF files are created, it may be difficult or impossible to highlight text.
 You can add the PDF file you're viewing to your iBooks app (or other PDF reader). This will allow you to access the PDF at any time, even without a network connection.


Tap the PDF you are viewing in Safari.
Tap the "Open in iBooks" button that appears. If you have another PDF reader, tap the "Open in..." button instead then select the app.
View your PDF in iBooks or your PDF reader. If you opened it in iBooks, it will be stored in the app and in your iCloud storage so that you can always access it.

 You may not have updated your resume for a long time. Spend time updating your resume and make sure that you highlight the transferable skills and education that is relevant to your new career.If you are struggling to create a dynamic resume, you can hire a career counsellor to help you construct an effective resume that is geared towards a job in your desired field.
 Search online job boards for positions within your desired field. Apply to as many jobs as possible. You should even apply for those that you donâ€™t have all the qualifications for. If there is a position that seems too good to be true and above and beyond what you are qualified for, apply anyway. There is little to lose and you might be exactly what the firm is looking for.
 It may have been years since you were last interviewed for a new job. In order to be successful in an interview, you should thoroughly research the company. This way you will appear knowledgeable about both the job and company goals and objectives. You should also practice some interview questions with a friend or family member. This will give you an opportunity to speak out loud and determine exactly how you will answer potential questions.During the interview make sure you draw connections between your past work experience and your new career. For instance, you may actually have years worth of experience in management, just in a different field.

 Once the bin is nearly full, you'll need to stop introducing new scraps and let the compost finish decomposing. You can leave the bin in any location during this process, and you should continue to turn the compost once a week. The compost should be finished in a few months, when it will appear as a uniform, rich, black mixture called humus.
 To work the compost into your houseplants' soil, simply sprinkle a small amount of it onto the top of the soil and then work it into the soil with your fingers.

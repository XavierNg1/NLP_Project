If you would like to use an existing project to add video to, choose the project from the "Project Library" located in the upper right hand corner of the iMovie window.
If you would like to create an entirely new project, go to the "File" menu and select "New Project." The iMovie program will prompt you to name your new project and choose an aspect ratio for your movie; either "Widescreen," "iPhone," or "Standard.";
, This mode setting will typically say "PC" or "Computer."

,, A window will automatically open showing all of the footage found on your video device.


If your video device is memory based, the window will show your video footage as thumbnail clips allowing you to scroll through the footage and skips scenes as you would a DVD. Memory based video devices allow you to use the playback controls to preview any of the thumbnail clips available in your video footage window.
If your video device is tape based, your video footage window will have fast forward and rewind buttons in order for you to cue the tape, scan through your footage, and select the correct clips.



To import all of the footage from your video device into the iMovie program, select the "Import All�" option at the bottom right hand corner of the video footage screen.
If you only want to import some of your video footage, switch the "Automatic" option to "Manual" at the bottom left hand corner of the video footage window. This will allow you to then scroll through your footage clips to select and de-select the video clips you wish to import into your iMovie project. If the clip has a checkmark under it, it is selected for import. If the clip does not have a checkmark, it is not selected for import. After you have sorted through and unchecked the clips you do not want, click on the "Import Checked" button located on the bottom right hand corner of the screen.
 Here you will again be allowed to choose to add the clips to either an existing iMovie project event, or create a new event. If you have a 1080i video, you can choose to either import your video at either the "Full � 1920x1080" resolution or as "Large � 960x540" half resolution; the "Large" option still views as a high quality picture, but imports the video as a smaller file size therefore allowing more space on your computer and iMovie project.
 The iMovie program will show the progress of the imports on the main iMovie window. Once all of your selected video footage has been imported, the project is ready for watching and editing from the computer.

 It takes time for children with normal sight to learn to tie their shoelaces; it will take a little more time for blind and visually impaired children to learn the same skill. Break the process up into stages and teach the child small chunks at a time. Once they’ve mastered one stage, move on to teaching them the next one., Introduce shoelace tying by having your child put their hands on top of yours while you tie your own shoes. This allows the child to “watch” you go through the actions and helps them get a feeling for what motions they will be using. Keep in mind that most sighted people also learn to tie their shoes through touch as well as sight, so touch is an important factor.Make sure to have the child sit next to you, rather than in front of you, so they can get used to how the actions feel from the correct perspective.
 This will help them learn about spatial concepts. Discuss movements in terms of up and down, front and back, right and left and in front of or behind. Demonstrate what a loop is and carefully explain how loops work. As you explain the movement, make sure you’re also demonstrating it so the child can feel what those words mean., The exact phrasing will depend on what tying technique you’re teaching, but use phrases like, “Take the right lace and cross it over the left lace.” Demonstrate while they “watch” with their hands. “Grab the right lace in your left hand and the left lace in your right hand. Pull them tightly.” “Make a loop with your thumb and index finger.” Provide short, easy-to-demonstrate explanations for each motion., Once the child is ready to move on from just “watching” you tie laces, make sure you continue to support them from behind. Let them take the lead, with you gently correcting movements and guiding when necessary. Have the child explain to you what they’re doing with each movement as they go through the motions.

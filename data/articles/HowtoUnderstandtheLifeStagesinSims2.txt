 A Sim can go through life starting as a baby, toddler, child, teen, young adult (if you have University), adult, and elder. During their life they can also experience pregnancy, death, and taxes (yes Sims do pay property tax when they pay their bills);
,

Babies = 3 days






Toddlers = 4 days






Children = 8 days






Teens = 15 days






Young adults = 24 days (University only)






Adults = 30 days






Elder = Varies; depends on their aspiration levels, etc.
 A huge responsibility of playing The Sims is making sure that your Sim succeeds in life and achieves a different goal in each life stage. A baby, toddler, or child that is not taken care of by other Sims can be taken away by social workers. A Young Adult can get kicked out of college if he or she gets below passing grades for two semesters in a row. An adult that misses work too much can get fired from their job.

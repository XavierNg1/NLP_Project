 Skim milk works best. There is no need to soak the entire garment, just the portion that is stained. Wait at least half an hour, and then scrub the stain gently with a toothbrush, cuticle brush or similar soft-bristled brush, and rinse thoroughly with warm water., Mix the bleach powder with a small amount of water to form a thin paste. Rub this paste into the stained area, and let it sit for 1/2 to 1 hour. Then scrub the stain with a soft-bristled brush, and rinse thoroughly with warm water.


Your stain should be entirely, or at least mostly gone at this point.
 If the stain is responding to the above methods but is not quite gone, then repeat the previous two steps. If it is not responding, rinse the garment thoroughly, and try either the method for removing gel ink stains, or the method for removing ballpoint ink stains.
 Inspect it thoroughly before placing it in the dryer. If the stain is not 100% gone, continue treating it until it is. The heat of the dryer will set any remaining ink and make the stain permanent.

 You can give yourself a steam treatment using your bathroom sink. Turn the tap on hot and fill the sink with water. If the tap water is not hot enough to create steam, then you can also boil some water and use that to fill the sink.


If you prefer not to use your bathroom sink, you can also fill a large metal or glass bowl with boiling water.
 Hot water alone can help to clear up mucus, but you can also add some essential oil to the water to increase the expectorant qualities. Add about three to four drops of the essential oil of your choice. Some good choices include:Eucalyptus
Camphor
Rosemary
Peppermint

, You will need a full-sized towel to cover your head and create a tent for the steam. Place the towel over the back of your head so that it hangs down on both sides of your head, similar to how long hair hangs when you are bending forward.


The towel should be long enough to touch the edges of the sink or bowl with your head about 12 to 15 inches away from the water. If it is not, then you will need to find a longer towel or you can use a sheet or blanket.
 After you have the towel over your head, hold your head over the sink and breathe in the steam for about 10 minutes. Make sure that you are about 12 to 15 inches away from the steamy water.


If you have trouble breathing or if it feels like the steam is burning you, then remove the towel and step away from the steam. If the water is just too hot, then try adding a bit of cool water to make it more bearable.
Never hold your head over water that is boiling on a stovetop! This is extremely dangerous.
 The steam should loosen up some of the mucus in your throat and nasal passages, so it is important to blow your nose during and after the treatment. If you feel the need to blow your nose during the steam treatment, take a moment to do so.


Make sure that you try to blow your nose at least once after the steam treatment as well.
Repeat the steam treatment once every two hours.

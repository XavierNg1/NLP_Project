 The best way to dull leather and make it looked aged is to wear and use it. Leather will continue to look duller and more beat up over the years. Speed up this slow aging process by using your leather items as often as you can., Put your leather item by itself in the washing machine and run it on the gentle cycle in cold water. Use a small amount (about one tablespoon or 14.79 mL) of regular laundry detergent. Wring it out when it’s finished, as the washing machine won’t be able to get out all the excess water. Transfer it to the dryer and run it on medium heat.Leather will shrink in the dryer. For items that you don’t want to get any smaller, use the no-heat tumble dry cycle.
 This may alter the color or add a few rain spots to the item once the leather dries. It will also naturally soften stiff leather. If you’re wearing a leather jacket or boots, the dampness will make the leather mold to your body., Stretch and soften particularly stiff spots on your leather items by striking them head-on with a hammer. This may be especially useful for leather shoes and boots, which often come with tough heels and toes. Don’t hit the items too hard, and check on your progress frequently.

Open-ended projects that have more than 1 option for a finished product are good for enhancing creativity in children. Boxes and tubs of craft supplies that do not have a single finished project pictured or a blank canvas and paints are good examples to allow for creativity.






Paint-by-number and other projects that confine children to specific methods for completion allow for less creative thinking.

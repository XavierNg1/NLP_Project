 Is it winter? Simply buy seeds. It is very important to note that if you are picking wild catnip, be certain it has not been treated with chemicals as this could be deadly for you and your cats! Do not pick catnip that is growing near a road.;
, Be aware that you will want to cut more than you think you need, because the plant is going to dry up and shrink.


Wait till the plant is at least 5 inches (12.7 cm) before cutting it.
, Stick a tack to the inside of the door, and tie your catnip around it.


Keep in mind that the plant must be hanging upside down and the door must be closed most of the time for the herbs to dry properly. The catnip will lose potency if exposed to light.
 Enjoy the smell and watch your cats go wild for the favorite treat!

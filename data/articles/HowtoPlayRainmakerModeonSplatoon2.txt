 Look at your gamepad, and quickly, yet carefully, decide the best route from your base to the center of the map, where the rainmaker lies. Don't let anything else loose your focus. Only destroy your enemies if they are absolutely in your way, and be quick, or the other team gets the rainmaker., Make sure there are no enemies nearby, and at least one player nearby if possible. You'll notice that there is a glowing ring around the rainmaker which can be destroyed by using your weapon until it bursts. When it does, it spreads a large amount of ink in the area around it, quickly sending all enemies in the area where the rainmaker's ring exploded back to respawn. Then swim straight towards it to collect it, or let another teammate do so if you're feeling generous., A rainmaker may seem cool since everyone is trying to get it, however, there are some drawbacks. First of all, a rainmaker is very heavy, so it is impossible to super jump to the enemy base and just win. Second, it works similar to an inkzooka, how it just blasts ink and knocks you back, but there is always a charge time, where you have to hold ZR and let go after a few seconds if you want the impact to immediately splat someone., Since they have the rainmaker, they are a popular target for the enemy team, considering that when the player with the rainmaker is splatted, the rainmaker is dropped, and the ring around it reforms, ready for someone else to try and grab it. To win, you need to be able to protect the player with the rainmaker, becomes sometimes having a powerful weapon that takes a while to charge isn't exactly convenient., Within enemy turf, lies a pillar where the rainmaker is placed by your team, and vice versa. It is tall, and you can't just jump on it, so you have to ink the side of it, and swim up to the top, and watch as your character places the rainmaker on the pillar, and thereby winning the battle.

 Spotlight is a search function that allows you to locate all saved data on your computer. You can open Spotlight one of two ways:


Press command+space.
Click on the magnifying glass at the top-right corner of your screen.
 As you type it into the search bar, Spotlight will autocomplete with the name of a file that matches what you're searching.
 If you're not sure what a file is called but remember a word or phrase contained in the file itself, you can type that in. A list of the files containing your search term will appear in the results list.


By separating your search terms with a space, you can avoid having to enter your search terms in order.
 Spotlight allows you to lookup information that is recorded in your browser data, such as your bookmarks or history. Searching for either of these will bring up eligible results.

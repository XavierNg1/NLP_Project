 First, you have to get the Framework installer which you can find in the Xposed Module Repository site below.


http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer;
, Before you can install the Framework, you have to make sure that “Unknown Sources” is checked in Settings>Security>Device Administration.


This enables installing third party application not found in the Google Play Store. Then, you can directly install it if you downloaded it on your device.
If you got it from your PC or Mac, you’ll have to transfer it somewhere on your phone, then install it. It should look like the typical Android application installation procedure.
 Locate the app icon and press it. Once it has loaded, go to “Framework.” Here, you can install or update the framework in case yours is outdated somehow.
 There is a “Soft Reboot” button below, which will reboot that device more quickly.


Done. Now that the Framework is installed, you can begin downloading the desired module.
,, Read the description and other info if you wish, and tap “Download.”

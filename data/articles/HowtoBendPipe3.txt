 If you're making a roll bar for a dune buggy that will occupy a space 60 inches (150 cm) wide by 50 inches (125 cm) high, make a rectangle with these dimensions on a clean space of concrete floor with a piece of chalk.
 The centerline should bisect the longer (width) sides of the rectangle.
 If the top of the roll bar should run only 40 inches (100 cm), subtract this length from the width for the bottom, then measure half the distance in from each of the upper corners. This works out to a difference of 20 inches (50 cm), half of which is 10 inches (25 cm), which is the distance to measure in. Mark this distance in from each of the top corners.
 If the distance from the bottom of the roll bar to the first bend is to be 40 inches (100 cm), measure and mark this distance up from each side of the bottom corners.
 You can measure the connecting lines with a ruler.


In this example, the diagonal line connecting the marks on the horizontal and vertical lines is about 14 inches (70 cm) long.
 Lay it so that the horizontal straight end touches the inside of the upper horizontal line.
,, Mark this place on the diagonal.
, Add together the measurements from the bottom corners to the first marks, the lengths of pipe between the lower bend, and the length between the upper bend.


In the above example, the vertical portions of the roll bar will each be 40 inches (100 cm) long, the diagonal portions will each be 14 inches (70 cm) long, and the horizontal portion will be 40 inches long. The total minimum length of pipe will be 40 + 14 + 40 + 14 + 40 inches (100 + 70 + 100 + 70 + 100 cm), or 144 inches (440 cm) long.
 Although the minimum length of pipe needed is 144 inches, it's a good idea to allow for error, add at least 4 inches (10 cm), making the total length 148 inches (450 cm).
 You'll work from this point outward.
 Mark on the pipe where the upper bends are to start and finish using the marks on the frame.


You may also want to mark the direction of your bends by putting arrows on the pipe pointing outward.
 Be sure the pipe's seam is to the inside when you bend; this prevents twisting or kinking during the bending process.


To ensure your bender is set to the correct angle, you can prepare a reference tool of 2 flat pieces of metal whose ends are attached to a pivot. Bend this tool to the angle indicated on your frame, and then match the bending angle of your bending tool to this angle.
After making each bend, lay the pipe against your frame to check that the angle of the bend is correct.
 Follow the same procedures as outlined in the previous step.

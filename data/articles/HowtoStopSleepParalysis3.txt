 Many people equate "natural" with "safe," but this is not always the case. It is important to check with your doctor or pharmacist before trying supplements, as they can interact with other medications you may be taking or can aggravate existing medical conditions. Your pharmacist can also recommend reputable brands for supplements â€” they are not regulated by the FDA, so the supplements may not actually contain what is advertised. Your pharmacist should know which brands are the best.

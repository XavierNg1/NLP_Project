 Use hand shears to trim any long, unbranched stems. Cut just above the healthy buds on the branch. Do this at a 45 degree angle.This type of pruning will encourage the lower side branches to develop and flourish.
 Pinching is an easy way to prune shrubs without making a cut. Use your thumb and forefinger to pinch off any dead buds on the branches or stems of the shrub. This will encourage the shrub to grow bushy and even. You usually pinch small-leaved shrubs to help them maintain an even shape., Shearing helps to produce new growth on a young shrub. To shear the shrub, cut it so it forms a rectangular shape that is slightly wider at the top. Do this by cutting near the buds at a 45 degree angle.Shearing can be done using hand shears or a pruning saw. If you are shearing a tall shrub, use pole pruners.
This type of pruning will cut right through leaves on the shrub so it should be done on small-leaved shrubs, as the cuts will be less noticeable.
 Thinning helps to reduce the bulk of the plant to encourage growth. Start by cutting off any old or wayward branches at a 45 degree angle. Cut them back 1-2 inches. Use hand shears, loppers, or a pruning saw to thin out the shrub.Try to remove stems or branches that have grown beyond the rest of the branches or stems. This will help to open up the middle of the shrub to sunlight, which will keep it healthy.

 Whether you like bold glasses or own 20 cats, it's the things that make you unique that make you memorable. Don't be afraid to show that side to the person you want to dream about you., That is, don't hide your opinion or thoughts. Being who you really are will help you stand out.For instance, if the person you are trying to get to notice you asks you what movie you like, don't just say, "Oh, you know, comedies." Be specific: "I really liked the latest Star Trek movie. I know a lot of Trekkies hated it, but I loved the story line."

, People like being told nice things about themselves, and you will increase your chances of being memorable if you do compliment someone., To stick in someone's mind, you need to stand out from the crowd. Therefore, you need to do things out of the norm. Wear a silly hat around the person. Bake a cake for him or her. Do something that makes him or her remember you in particular., One way to show you are interested in a person is to listen intently. You show you genuinely care about what the person thinks or says. Because this quality is rare, it will help you stand out., If you're just meeting a person, give them a memorable piece of information about yourself. The best kinds of hooks are funny.For instance, say you're meeting a friend of your sister at a gathering in Arizona. You could say, "Hi, I'm Carrie's sister from Oklahoma. I tried to leave the tornadoes behind, though."

, When starting up a conversation, move away from questions about the person's job or the weather. Instead, try more interesting topics, such as a local play that's running or a great book you just read.

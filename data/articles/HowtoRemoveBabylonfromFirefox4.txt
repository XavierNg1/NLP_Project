 Launch Firefox, then type in the address of the page you would like to set as your new home page.
 Once the site loads, click on the tab at the top of the Firefox window. Hold the mouse button down. Drag your cursor over the small button that looks like a house in the top right corner. Release the mouse button.


When the confirmation window opens, click "Yes." The next time you open Firefox, this website will be your home page.
 If, for whatever reason, the method above doesn't work, use these steps to set your new home page manually:


Click the Firefox menu button (the three horizontal lines in the top right).
Click "Options" (the icon will look like a gear).
Click the "General" tab.
Enter the address you would like to use in the "Home Page" text box. You can also press the "Restore to Default" button to set the home page to the standard Firefox site.

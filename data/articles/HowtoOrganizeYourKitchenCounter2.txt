 If your dish soap, rag, scrubbers, and sponges are scattered around the sink, organize them into one place. Pick up a simple cake stand and place all of the dishwashing supplies on it.Look for a cheap cake stand at a thrift store.
 If you keep your flour, sugar, salt, oatmeal, or various other baking items on the counter, a set of storage jars will keep them organized. You have almost unlimited options, from glass jars to plastic rectangular canisters.Look for a set of stacking containers to keep this stuff even more condensed.
It’s also a good time to think about whether you need to keep that stuff on the counter. You may use it less than you think you do, so move it to the cabinets.
 Your counter may be the place you store various food preparation items. Honey, olive oil, soy sauce, or corn syrup can all make your counter sticky. Store these on a tray so the mess stays contained. A tray also makes for easier cleaning than a whole section of counter.Set this tray on whatever part of the counter you are most likely to prepare foods that would need these items.
 Grab an old coffee can or an elegant ceramic container. Fill it with spoons, spatulas, whisks, or any other utensils. If you use these items daily, keeping them on the counter makes it easier to access them. The container won’t take up much space and is great for organizing., You may store pieces of fruit, small bags of chips, candy, or other snacks on the counter. These take up a lot of space. Put a tiered basket on the counter to gather the assorted snack foods into one place.If a wire basket doesn’t fit your decor, opt for a two-level rack for ceramic trays or glass bowls. Any tiered rack uses up vertical space as opposed to sideways space on the counter.

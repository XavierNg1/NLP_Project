 Make sure it fully covers the table, then tape it down on the underside of the table.


A small table is probably best, so that you don't have too much area to cover. A little tea table or a stand would be a good choice.;
, To do this:


Use the template shown in this article.
Cut out the pieces and the slit and attach together by inserting at the slit line.
Make more as needed until you have enough. Set aside until the other major pieces have been placed.
 Use ice-blue paper. Cut a lake shape from the paper, then tape down onto the green paper on the table.
 Some examples of paper house making can be found at How to make a paper house. Or, create your own templates or print some from a different craft site. Set aside for the moment.
 Place the houses and trees at the edges of the lake. Introduce other elements to bring the scene to life, such as model people, toy cars, model animals, etc.
 Apply silver or white glitter to the houses and trees and around the scene. You may wish to put some on the lake too.
 If the table is under something you can use for hanging thread from, have Santa in his sleigh hanging above the scene. Or, have him already in the scene––perhaps he's just landed.


You can use a model Santa in sleigh or draw a template and cut one out from paper.
 Hide small presents (rings, bouncy balls) under the scene's trees and under houses.
 This optional but gives the whole scene a finished appearance.

 Pull back all of your braids into a ponytail, using an over-sized headband. Arrange the ponytail on the top of your head.;
, Divide them into six to eight sections.
 Within each section, make a single twist from the root to the ends. Secure with a hairband or small braid.
 Now that you have several larger twists, you can pin them into all kinds of shapes. Try pinning them up as a bun, or arranging the twists along the top of your head for a braided mohawk.

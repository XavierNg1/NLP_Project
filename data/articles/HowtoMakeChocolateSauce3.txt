 Combine cream, syrup, brown sugar, cocoa powder, salt and half the chocolate together in a medium saucepan., Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low or low (wherever it reaches a low simmer). Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.Remember that you want a low simmer, not a rapid boiling after the mixture has reached its initial boiling point. Your mixture shouldn't be splashing about and all over the stove - this is a sign you've got the temperature too high.
 Stir in the remaining chocolate, the butter, and the vanilla extract. Stir until smooth.
 The sauce will thicken as it cools.Store in a jar or airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
 The texture you're looking for is pourable but still thick.

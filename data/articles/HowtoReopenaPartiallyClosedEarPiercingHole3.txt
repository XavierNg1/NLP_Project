 After you have reopened your piercings, plan to keep your small earrings inserted for at least 6 weeks. If you remove the earrings earlier, the holes may begin to grow over again., Establish a cleaning routine every morning or evening. Use antibacterial soap to wash your hands, and then wash your earlobes with warm water and soap once a day. This will help keep the area clean and prevent it from becoming infected.You can also help prevent scabbing by cleaning the area with rubbing alcohol twice a day. Use a cotton ball or cotton swab and apply the rubbing alcohol around each piercing.
 With clean hands, gently grab the earring and twist. Do this movement every day to prevent the piercing from closing again.

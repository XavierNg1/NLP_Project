 Blotting paper is smooth, absorbent paper that removes oil without taking off your makeup. It's the most convenient quick fix for an oily face: simple take out a sheet and blot your forehead, nose, chin, and any other oily spots. You can buy blotting paper at most drugstores, but if you don't have it on hand, try one of these handy substitutes:


Tissue paper. Use the plain white kind that that you use to wrap presents. Avoid getting colored tissue paper, since it can bleed on your skin.
Cigarette papers. These are made from smooth paper similar to blotting paper. They're usually cheaper than blotting papers, too.
Toilet seat covers. In a pinch, you can use a clean paper toilet seat cover as blotting paper. Cut it into smaller squares and blot away.;
, These are convenient when you're on the go and just have to wipe away the oil on your face. Since cleansing pads are wet and they contain soap, use this solution when you aren't wearing makeup - cleansing pads will take it right off. If possible, splash your face with cold water after using a pad to remove the trace amounts of soap.
 Use a cotton ball to smooth some toner over the oily areas of your face. Toner takes off the oil and tightens the skin, temporarily cleaning your face. You can buy a bottle of toner at the beauty supply store or drugstore, or make your own using the following recipe:









Put 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar in a jar.
Add 1 cup of filtered or distilled water.Shake the jar and use a cotton ball to apply this natural toner to your skin as often as you want.
 Splashing some cold water on your face will tighten up your pores and make your face feel fresher. Pat it dry with a soft towel when you're finished. This is a good quick solution no matter where you find yourself with an oily face.

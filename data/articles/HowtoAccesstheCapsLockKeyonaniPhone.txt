 This is a gray cog icon on your home screen that may be in a folder labeled “Utilities.”;
,, It’s in the sixth set of options.
 It will turn green. This will allow you to use Caps lock on your keyboard to type in all capital letters.


It may already be in the “On” position, and you won’t need to do anything.
 This will happen automatically when you tap a text field you can type in such as a search bar, the address bar for Safari, a note in your Notes app, or the bar at the bottom of a conversation in Messages.
 A line will appear under the arrow if you have done this correctly, and Caps Lock will be turned on.


To perform a double-tap, you need to tap twice quickly. If you wait too long between taps, it will not work.
In earlier iOS versions, the arrow will be white with a blue background when Caps Lock is on.
Tapping once on the arrow is similar to pressing ⇧ Shift on a computer keyboard, and will allow you to type one capital letter.
 You will be able to type capital letters until you tap the arrow again.


When you leave the keyboard that displays the alphabet, such as when you tap 123 or access your emoji keyboard, it will also turn Caps Lock off.

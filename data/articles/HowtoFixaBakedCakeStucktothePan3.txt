 If the cake is burned, carefully saw it off with a wire cake cutter or a large bread knife. If it ends up crooked, don't try to fix it with a second cut, as this will likely reduce your cake to crumbs. Patch the broken area with frosting instead, as described below.
 If a few small bits have broken off, wedge them underneath the cake. If your cake is moist enough, these will stick back to the cake fairly well, especially if the cake is still hot.
 Put together a batch of frosting and spread it over the cake in a smooth surface. Dollops of any frosting can fill holes and uneven edges in a cake.


Sugar-and-liquid icing is too thin and runny to do the trick.
 If your cake looks like a demolition site, you'll need extra-sticky frosting to hold it together. You can make caramel frosting, dulce de leche, or try this sticky chocolate frosting recipe:


Mix 1 can condensed milk, 3 tsp (15mL) cocoa powder, and 2 tsp (10g) unsalted butter.
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly. Stop when it reaches a slightly thick, gluey consistency.
Allow it to cool to room temperature; it will thicken more as it sets.
Place the broken pieces on top of each other as close to the desired shape as possible. Cover the surface and cracks liberally with the frosting.

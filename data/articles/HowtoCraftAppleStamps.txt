 Keep the best apples for eating, and use the bruised or older ones to make some apple stamps.;
, Prepare your work-space by laying down newspaper to protect all surfaces.
 Pour the paint onto the paper plates, using a separate plate for each color.


You can use any color paint, but red and green – the colors of apples – are most popular.
Use paint that is suitable for application to whatever surface you're using, whether it's paper, fabric, etc. Make sure it's non-toxic paint too, so that the kids can do this.
 Let the apples dry for an hour after cutting and before dipping.



Use a paintbrush to spread the color evenly across the apple half.



Dip the apple in the paint or brush the paint on again for each subsequent stamp, and have paper towels on hand to blot excess paint.
 Create a pretty design in the other half of the apple by cutting a heart, star, or other shape into the center of the cut side of the apple before applying paint.


Use a paintbrush to apply paint separately to the design you've cut out.
 Use fabric paint and the apple stamps to create a cute fabric tote bag or grocery bag.


Allow to dry before using or wrapping as a gift.

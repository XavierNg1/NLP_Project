 Unless you have a full-time nanny and household staff, your friend-time has probably been seriously restricted since having children. This change is natural and understandable, but you should still make an effort to get together occasionally if you want to remain close friends.For example, book a babysitter one night and go to dinner and a movie just like the old days! Or do something new and explore the local farmers market or a gallery opening. Just make sure the planned activity allows for plenty of conversation.
If you can’t get a babysitter, have your friend come over after kids’ bedtime so you can watch an R-rated movie and catch up.
 The daily demands and logistics of parenthood can mean that you rarely get to see your non-parent friends. This doesn’t mean you have to lose all contact, though. Even a short text or an email of a funny YouTube video can show your friend you’re thinking of them and haven’t forgotten them in the fog of family life.Texting and emails can be great ways to stay in frequent communication, but don’t underestimate the power of a good, old-fashioned phone call. Next time you’re waiting in line at the market or doing the laundry, ring up your friend for a ten-minute chat.
 Your child-free friends have probably spent many hours babysitting and listening to your parenting woes—not to mention the presents they’ve probably purchased over the years for you and your family—so think about returning the favor! Show how much you appreciate your friend despite the differences in your lives by making a special, caring gesture.


For example, send a care package full of coffee, wine, and snacks, buy them a workout gear or weekly meal subscription box, or mail them a gift certificate.

 Mix one-quarter cup of warm water with one cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice or bottled lemon juice, then add one cup of orange juice and fill a spray bottle with the mixture.

, The citrus/water mixture can further dry hair, so add one-quarter cup of the hair conditioner of your choice, then whisk in a small bowl and set aside.
 You are going to use the power of sunlight to activate the lightening effects of the citric acid, so make sure that your skin is protected from harmful UVA and UVB rays.
 For full coverage, spray the mixture over all your hair and give it a few light brushes.


Add highlights, if desired. Soak a cotton ball in the lemon and orange mixture and slide it down the strands you want highlighted. Try to keep track of which strands were lightened, because the process takes a while and you'll have to reapply the lightener several times for it to take effect.
If using the lemon conditioner mixture for dry hair, take a pastry brush or similar item and brush the hair you want lightened with the mixture. This mixture will have more body and be slicker than the lemon-orange-water mixture, so it will be harder to get highlights with it.
 You will need to sit outside in direct sunlight for at least an hour to an hour and a half to begin seeing any color change.
 Continue sitting in the sun for another 30 minutes.
 Wash your hair, and then deep-condition with a generous amount of hair conditioner or another natural substance.

Light brown to golden blonde

Dark red to dark blonde
Light red to light brown or blonde
Black won't show much change at all.

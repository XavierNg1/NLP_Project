 This is a quick method if you are only roasting one or two peppers, but you will need to use caution as you are working near open flame. To do this method, you will need the following ingredients and supplies: Red peppers
Aluminum foil
Tongs
Oven mitts
Gas range
Towel

, Since you are using a direct flame, you don't want the heat to be on high.Wrap each pepper in a double layer of aluminum foil.
Seal the foil tightly and make sure there are no openings.
As the pepper roasts it will leak out juices. You won't want these to leak onto your burner, so the foil is necessary to prevent leaks as well as to prevent the pepper from charring too much.
 Place your foil wrapped pepper on top of your burner.It will take about 20 minutes to roast a pepper on a gas burner.
Use tongs to turn the pepper a quarter turn every 4-5 minutes.
After 20 minutes, use tongs to gently squeeze the pepper. If it is soft and yields to the tongs, it is ready.
If the pepper is still somewhat firm, allow it to roast for a few more minutes.
 Allow it to sit inside the foil for 15-20 minutes.The pepper will steam inside the foil wrapper, so there is no need to use a paper bag.
Unwrap the foil after the pepper has sat for the required time.
Cut the pepper vertically and spread it out in one big piece.
Remove the stem and wipe away any seeds with your towel.
Flip the pepper over and peel away the skin.

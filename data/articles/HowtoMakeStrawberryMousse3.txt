 Get out a small saucepan and wash 1 1/4 cups (250 g) of fresh strawberries. Use a small knife to carefully trim off the strawberry stems and discard them. Cut the strawberries in half, if they're large. Set 2 strawberries aside and place the remaining strawberries in the pan along with:1/8 cup (25 g) of sugar
1/3 cup + 2 tablespoons (100 ml) of water

, Turn the heat on to medium and stir the sugared strawberries. Cook the strawberries, so they start to bubble gently. Simmer the strawberries for 3 minutes or until they're soft. Turn off the heat and use a fork to mash the strawberries.

You could also use a potato masher to mash the strawberries. Be gentle when mashing, so you don't splash hot juice on you.
 Measure out 1 1/2 cups (140 g) of mini-marshmallows and add them to the hot strawberry mixture. Stir the mini-marshmallows in, so they dissolve completely. Let the mixture cool in the pan.

The mini-marshmallows will help the strawberry mousse set up, since the mini-marshmallows contain gelatin.
 Place 3/4 cup + 2 tablespoons (200 ml) of heavy whipping cream into a large mixing bowl. Use a stand or hand mixer to whisk the cream on high speed for several minutes. The cream should stiffen, so the whisks leave firm peaks when you lift them away.

To help the cream whip, chill the mixing bowl and whisk attachments for 5 to 15 minutes before whipping the cream.
 Once the strawberry mixture is cool, scoop in the whipped cream and use a rubber spatula to gently fold it in. Transfer the strawberry marshmallow mousse into a serving bowl or individual dishes. Refrigerate the mousse for 2 hours, so it sets up.

You can cut the reserved strawberries in half and garnish the mousse with the halves.

 These sprinklers have a spike that sticks into the ground with a pulsating head on top where water is released. A single jet of water is released when the head pulses around.


Pulsating sprinklers are low to the ground where wind does not interfere with the jets of water.
Purchasing pulsating sprinklers is a good idea if you have low water pressure. These sprinklers work well to disperse a large amount of water over a large area, even with low water pressure.

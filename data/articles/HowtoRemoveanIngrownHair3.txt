 This will soften the skin.


Just wet a washcloth with hot water, wring it out, and press it against the ingrown hair. When the washcloth cools down, run it under hot water again.
If you can see the ingrown hair embedded in the skin, this treatment will soften the hair and bring it closer to the surface. If you can't initially see the hair, leave the warm compress on until it rises to the skin's surface.
If you apply the compress for ten minutes, and you still can't see any sign of hair, you're not going to be able to remove it yourself, or it might be something else altogether. And while you're fretting over your skin, this might be a good time to Check for Skin Cancer.

 Place ⅓ cup (75 g) butter in a medium-size saucepan, and turn the heat to medium. Allow the butter to heat for approximately 5 minutes or until it melts completely. Make sure to stir it regularly as it heats so it doesn’t burn.The butter will melt more quickly if you cut it into pieces.
 Once the butter has melted, add ⅓ cup (41 g) of all-purpose flour to the pan. Use a whisk to stir the flour into the butter and continue mixing until the mixture is smooth. Allow it to cook for approximately 3 minutes on medium-low heat to remove the raw flour taste.Make sure to lower the burner’s heat while the butter and flour mixture is cooking. It can burn very easily.
 After the butter and flour mixture has cooked for a few minutes, stir in 3 cups (710 ml) of turkey or chicken broth and ¼ teaspoon (2.5 g) of ground black pepper. Turn the heat back up to medium, and allow the gravy to cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until it’s bubbly and thick., Once the gravy has thickened up, let it cook for another minute on medium heat. However, be sure to stir it with a whisk the entire time to ensure that it stays smooth and lump-free.At the end of the minute of cooking, it’s a good idea to give the gravy a taste and season with a little salt if necessary.
 When the gravy is finished, remove the pan from the stove. Pour the gravy into a gravy boat or other serving dish. If desired, you can garnish it with chopped fresh parsley. Serve it while it’s still hot.

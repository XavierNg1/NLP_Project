 If you are not the chairperson or meeting leader, but simply another participant at the meeting, ask the meeting leader for a quick chat after the meeting. Tell them how disruptive you found the person who was muttering all the time and how it impacted your hearing, your ability to concentrate and your understanding of what was going on. These are good, neutral and outcome-impacting reasons that the chairperson or meeting leader can use to present a case to the muttering participant as reasons to stop muttering and making snide remarks.
 This can often be the most effective as a form of peer pressure when the person making inane side remarks realizes that their antics are not appreciated and are not winning them any points with the colleagues. Again, keep to the facts as in the step above.
 Sometimes a muttering participant is trying to get others to accept that they know more than the speaker. This kind is looking for personal validation, and failing to get that, they may stop. If they do not, and you have their attention or are seated close, try a short glance of annoyance. If the person is close and persists, a low comment "Sh, I want to hear this." could work.

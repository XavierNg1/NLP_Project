 Reduce, reuse, and recycle, in that order! First, reduce and consume less plastic. If you must use any plastic at all, reuse products whenever you can. Until you cut plastic completely out of your life, recycle.If your community offers a curb pick-up recycling service, be sure to recycle everything that you can.
Bring your recyclables to a recycling center or bin drop-off. If there is no recycling center nearby, try storing your plastic items instead of throwing them away, then taking them to a recycling center in the nearest city the next time that you go.
 Look around you and check if there are any recyclable bags that can be used for your needs. If you already have plastic bags stored up, you can keep on reusing them over and over again until they break. Once they break, you can take the ripped-up bags to your local grocery store, which may be able to reuse them.


Line small household bins with paper bags.
Consider washing out Ziploc bags and reusing them.
 You can refill them with liquid, use them as storage, or fill them with water and put them up in your windows for passive solar heating.
 Ask your local grocer to take your plastic containers (for berries, tomatoes, etc.) back. If you shop at a farmers market they can refill it for you. Use your plastic to grow plants or to store other things.
 Use your junk mail to line fragile gifts to post, rather than plastic bubble wrap.

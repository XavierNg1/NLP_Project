Leather is not vegan because it is made from animal skin and hides.
Read clothing labels to find alternative products that imitate leather such as pleather, synthetic leather, man-made leather, waxed-cotton, and imitation-leather.
Clothing made from imitation-leather materials are generally far lower in price than clothing made from genuine leather or suede.;

Although silkworms produce silk naturally, sometimes silkworms are boiled alive to extract extra amounts of silk.
Buy materials and fabric that feel like and resemble silk such as polyester, nylon, rayon, tussah, ceiba tree and silk-cotton tree filaments, milkweed seed-pod fibers, and tencel, which is fabric made from wood pulp.



Clothing made from down and feathers are not vegan because they are plucked from animals while they are alive or the animals are slaughtered specifically for their down.
Read clothing labels to find substitutes for down, such as polyester fill, synthetic down, down-alternative, and hypo-allergenic synthetic down.



Goats, sheep, camels, and rabbits are animals that generate wool and in some cases are raised in harsh conditions for their hair.
Wool products that should be avoided are angora, cashmere, pashmina, mohair, camel hair, and shearling.
Buy alternative wool materials such as polyester fleece, cotton flannel, acrylic, orlon, synthetic wool, synthetic fleece, and any other wool fabric preceded by "synthetic."
Some man-made products exist that rival wool in terms of thickness, providing warmth, and can wick away moisture. These products are generally made from recycled plastic soda bottles and can be found in specialty stores that feature outdoors clothing.



Fur and pelts are not vegan because they are taken from animals raised or trapped specifically for their fur such as foxes, minks, lynxes, rabbits and more.
Look for clothing labels that indicate faux fur, polyester, acrylic, or mod-acrylic, all of which can accurately replicate fur.

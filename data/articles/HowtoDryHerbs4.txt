 Tie a rubber band around the stems of the herbs. Any flowers on the herbs should face downward.

Drying times will likely vary if bundling together different types of herbs, so consider only making bundles of a single type of herb until you're more experienced and can mix the herbs knowing the drying times specific to each.






If you're doing a set of herb bundles, you might consider keeping the bundles sizes similar, so that the drying times coincide. This makes it easier when it comes time to store or used the dried herbs, so that you don't have to wait for the next bunch to dry. But it all depends on what you're doing with the herbs and your immediate needs.
 The paper bag can speed up the drying process and catch falling seeds, leaves, etc. On the other hand, having no bag means you can have some lovely bunches of herbs on display in your home.
 All sorts of items can be used to hang herbs from, including ladders, ceiling beams, coat hangers, a nail, etc.


Herbs can also be dried on a rack or screen. An old window screen can be used if clean and in decent shape. Position such a screen to allow the air to move freely both sides of the screen. If using a screen, you'll need to turn the herbs daily to prevent curling.
 Herbs should dry away from direct sunlight and moisture or they will spoil. Drying times will take anywhere from 5 days to a few weeks, depending on the types of herbs you're drying.
 The herbs are dried when they just become crisp and no moisture can be felt.
 Many dried herbs will crumble readily, making them easy to turn into herb mixes such as bouquet garni. Dried herbs are often great additions to potpourri too.

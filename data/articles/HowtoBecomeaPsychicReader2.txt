 Purchase your ball from a legitimate psychic good dealer. If possible, examine each in person. A quality crystal ball will be made of natural quartz crystal, either clear or white in color. The correct ball should choose you as much as you choose it. You might get a feeling that the ball “belongs” to you, or you might see your name reflected in the surface of the ball. A ball three inches in diameter is an ideal size.


Do not buy a crystal ball from a pawn shop, flea market, or other used goods emporium. Such a ball may be imbued with negative energy, and may have been discarded for that reason., Candle lighting works well and provides the right ambiance for a reading. The light source should be in front and ahead of the ball so that when you gaze into it, it is illuminated adequately. If you use electric light, try to use a dimmer so that you can adjust the luminosity. Draw the curtains if you're conducting a reading during the day.
 Cup it carefully in your hands and begin to rotate it slowly from right to left. Rotate the ball at the rate of only about one centimeter every eight seconds. Be careful not to drop the ball, as they tend to be fragile and can break easily. Always hold and move the crystal ball gently, as you would a small baby.
 First, look at the patterns, refractions, and striations with your physical eyes. Continuing to turn the ball over, begin to gaze into the ball with your third eye, the one which perceives psychic energy. You may believe you're entering a trance state and receiving visions from the past, present, or future. The visions may pertain to you or a third party whose energy you perceive and use to guide your crystallomancy session.

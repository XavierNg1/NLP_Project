, It will be called something like Shimo_4.1.2_8433.zip.
, You may see this button on a pop-up window that asks you to confirm you want to run the program. If you don’t see it, just skip to the next step.
 You should see a new icon appear in your menu bar. It’s the outline of a square with rounded edges at its top. This is the Shimo icon., A menu will appear.
, It’s the blue icon at the top left corner of the Preferences panel.,,

 Attention of any kind can be bad if your dog is acting out or being hyperactive- dogs tend to value bad attention over no attention at all. If your pet is behaving in an unwanted way, stay calm and firm- to express your disapproval, distance yourself from your dog and leave the room if necessary. Once this reaction is repeated enough times for your dog to register it, it will be understood as the negative consequence of its bad, hyperactive behavior.Note that when you first attempt to ignore your dog's bad behavior, it might increase in severity temporarily.;
, When your dog gets too hyper, take the time to break down exactly what bad behaviors need to be addressed. In the moment, remain calm and firm to avoid exacerbating the situation. Later, you can concentrate on training your dog out of these problems.


For instance, if your hyper dog jumps on people, train it to sit instead. Set up "practice" scenarios and keep your dog on its leash, in the house, to better control its actions; repeat this regularly and reward it when it sits, and refrains from jumping on anyone.
 When your dog is calm and well-behaved, lavish it with love, praise, petting, and treats. Increasing positive associations when your dog is acting in the way you want it to is necessary to let it know that this behavior is good. Attention earned by good behavior will result in more good behavior.

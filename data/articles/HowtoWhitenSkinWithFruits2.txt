 Blend the peel and fruit together along with honey as a binding agent to produce a mask. Pears contain arbutin – a naturally occurring form of hydroquinone, which has been proven to be an effective tyrosinase inhibitor. Tyrosinase is an enzyme that helps to produce melanin, the pigment that darkens skin, so inhibiting will produce a skin-whitening effect.Be sure to include the peel, which contains much higher concentrations of arbutin than the fruit.Asian pears (pyrus pyrifoli) contain much more arbutin than American or European varieties.The best varieties to use are Yaquang, Hongpi, Quingpi, or Guifei.Be aware that arbutin has been reported to cause skin irritation for some people. If you develop skin irritation, stop using pear-based masks., Blend half a pomegranate, 2 teaspoons of almond oil, and ½ a tablespoon of honey to make a pomegranate mask. Pomegranate fruit contains punicalagins – compounds that have been shown to directly inhibit melanin production., Blend four slice of pineapple in a food processor along with a half a tablespoon of honey. Pineapple fruit contains compounds that act as tyrosinase inhibitors, thereby whitening skin., Compounds in fig fruit have been shown to decrease melanin and moisturize skin.Mash the fruit and apply in a mask.

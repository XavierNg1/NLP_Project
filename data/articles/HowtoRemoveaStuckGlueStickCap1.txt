 Make sure you are able to lift at least one corner up easily. The chair does not have to be fancy, it can be a kitchen chair or a stationary desk chair. Avoid using plastic stools and mobile office chairs.;
, Ask for assistance if needed.
 Slowly lower the chair leg onto the glue stick cap. Apply a soft pressure using your hands. If the pressure is not strong enough, sit on the chair gently and ensure that you do not crack the cap of the glue stick. Stop when you hear a cracking sound, this should be the glue separating from the cap.
 If the cap still remains stuck, apply more pressure using the chair. You can also apply more pressure using your hands.
 Make sure you remove the sticky residue from using the glue.


Using a damp sponge can help wipe off the excess residue.

 An important part of building credit is establishing your ability to make payments. This requires you to have income. Your employer will likely do a credit check and may report your income.


Creditors define ability to pay as the ratio of debts to income.For example, if you have a debt to income ratio of 50%, that would mean half of your income is already committed to paying existing debt. It also means you probably have a limited ability to make additional payments, which would hurt your credit rating. This means that the higher your income is, the higher your ability to pay will likely be.
 Being with a company over a year is another benefit since it shows more stability.


Even if you don't love your job, try to stick with it for at least a year before moving on. Regular paychecks show creditors stability., Working under the table (off the books) will not help you to build credit. These earnings are not reported, so as far as creditors are concerned, they don't count.


Creditors must be able to verify the source and amount of your income. If they cannot, they will not know that you have an ability to pay.

 Perk 1 really boils down to personal preference. However, Bazooka, Betties, and Flamethrower are all good ideas. Bazooka can be used to kill people behind walls and / or serve as an anti-tank weapon. Betties are popular due to the fact that they can protect you from being attacked through a certain passageway on the map. The flamethrower, despite being only available at level 65, provides a way to attack enemies at close range if you are in a tight situation.;
, Unless you can aim at the head consistently, use Stopping Power as perk 2 to increase the damage per bullet and thereby increase the chance of you killing the enemy when you shoot.
 For snipers, perk 3 is best equipped with Deep Impact or Steady Aim. Deep Impact allows you to shoot through certain walls / surfaces, which can be very useful if you know that the enemy is hiding in a very specific spot. However, if you usually shoot enemies that are out in the open and would like to increase your chances of getting kills from no scopes, Steady Aim is a decent choice.
 You should pick from any pistol but the Tokarev (the Tokarev has a bad reload time). All pistols, with exception of the Magnum, kill in 3 hits, but the only difference is reload time. The Nambu is the best in reload time, but the sights on the gun is slightly misaligned and therefore may cause accuracy problems. Because of this, the Walther, which has the 2nd best empty clip reload, or the Colt, with the 2nd best partial clip reload, may be the better choice for you. However, the Magnum is also a good idea once you have unlocked it. At close range, the Magnum kills in 2 hits. However, this comes at the expense of having the worst reload time of the pistols. Choose wisely when picking a pistol.

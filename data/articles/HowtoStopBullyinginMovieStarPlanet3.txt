 It's a choice you're making and it's neither healthy nor friendly. While it may feel easy to push people around in the online sphere, the ease with which it is possible is not an excuse nor a defense for doing it.


Deal with the underlying issues that cause you to feel so bad that you want to lash out at other people. Talk to a parent, a friend, or a counselor about your problems.
Seek support for issues you cannot cope with. If you're experiencing bullying yourself, it doesn't make things better to turn around and do the same things. Be the bigger person and report and block the bully, then get on with your own business without letting that person distract you.
 If you have been bullying, annoying or bothering someone, realize that you've probably hurt their feelings or even scared them. Have the courage to apologize, let them know that you had a rough patch and that it won't be happening again. Most of all, let them know that you will be leaving them alone and that it's up to them if they want to stay connected with you as a friend or fellow player. Giving them the choice shows them that you are taking this seriously.

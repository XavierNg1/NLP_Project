 Stainless steel does stain and spot so it is good to keep on top of it. There are a few different methods to cleaning stainless steel.
 Use a small amount of neutral cleaner if you feel it requires more. Rinse and dry by hand to avoid spots.


Remove grease with rubbing alcohol on a soft cloth.
Remove burnt stains with a paste of baking soda and water. Always rinse and dry by hand.

 If you have owned or operated the land for at least 12 months, then you can apply. You can enroll in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in two ways. You should pick the method which works best for you:General sign-up. General sign-ups are announced periodically by the Secretary of Agriculture. They do not occur at set intervals. Instead, you should ask your local FSA office to notify you of when a general sign-up has been announced.

Continuous sign-up. You can also apply any time that you want using continuous sign-up. Unlike general sign-up, offers are not subject to competitive bidding.Instead, FSA will identify the most environmentally-sensitive lands and enroll them in the program.
 To qualify for general sign-up, your land must meet certain conditions. You should check to see that your land qualifies:You must have planted cropland four of the past six years between 2008 and 2013, and the land must be capable of being planted.
Alternately, certain pastures that can act as riparian buffers also qualify.
The land must be sufficiently vulnerable to erosion.
 You can get more details about either general sign-up or continuous sign-up by contacting your local FSA.You should also discuss what factors FSA will use to rank to analyze the landâ€™s potential environmental benefits.

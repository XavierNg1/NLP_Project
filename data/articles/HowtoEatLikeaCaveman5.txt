 Part of what makes the Paleo diet different than other diets is fact that fat intake is not restricted, since cavemen/women did not limit their intake. In fact, you are encouraged to consume healthy fats and oils. After all, fat is not what makes you fat, and this is your bodyâ€™s preferred source of energy.Healthy fats and oils include:


Coconut oil
Olive oil
Macadamia oil
Avocado oil
Grass-fed butter.

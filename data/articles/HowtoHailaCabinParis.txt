 Taxi ranks are located at most major intersections throughout the city, consisting of tented areas and street corners with a "Taxi" sign prominently displayed. You can find one using maps, phone and computer applications, and by asking locals.;
, You need to stand in line in the rank area and wait your turn for a taxi. If you are within 50 m (164 feet) of a rank (but not at the rank itself), taxis won't stop for you. If you are outside of a rank's designated 50 m (164 feet) range, you can freely hail a cab.
 It's important to ride only in licensed taxis, as you'll have no legal recourse if cheated by an unlicensed taxi driver. Taxis in Paris come in numerous colors and car types, but you can tell if a taxi is licensed by looking for these things:


A "Taxi Parisien" sign on the roof
A working fare meter
A taxi license plate on the front right wing of the vehicle
A display on the back of the taxi that monitors its daily usage

 There are several ways of getting there:



Drive your car to Miramar. Follow the signs at the shops in Miramar and drive down Camperdown Road until Weka Street. The Weta Cave is at 1 Weka Street.
Take bus number 2 from the city to Miramar. Get off at Camperdown Road (ask the bus driver to drop you off).

Taxi (cab). Let the taxi driver know where you're going.;
, Entry is free.
 This is filled with many of the props and figurines from the movies Weta has had a hand in. You can take photos if you like.
 If you miss a screening, just wait watching the countdown until the next one starts. The actual workshops can't be toured because they're confidential. However, a drive-by some of the local Weta workshops can sometimes afford a glimpse of something special â€“ if you're very lucky.


The movie runs about every 1/2 hour. If you miss going in on time, you'll have to wait for the next showing. Check out the posters on the ceiling to pass the time.
 Even if you're not seeking to purchase anything, the shop is a delight, with lots of sculptures, feature pieces, portraits, miniatures, etc. for you to check out.

 Some Craigslist users will try to scam you by seeking information such as bank account and routing numbers or your social security number, which they can use to commit fraud or identity theft.


Do not submit any personal or financial information to people claiming to perform background or credit checks until you have met with and spoken with them in person.



Do not pay in advance for products, services, or job fees to lower your risk of being scammed.
Do not accept cashier's checks or money orders because although the checks may clear initially, they may bounce later if they are fraudulent and the bank will hold you financially responsible for the funds.
Do not use money-wiring or online escrow services because you may not be refunded if transactions are deemed fraudulent.



If you are interested in a home or apartment, visit and inspect the interior before you make payments or sign any contracts.
If you are purchasing a specific product such as a used electronics item, verify the item contains all the parts as advertised and that it works properly before you buy it.

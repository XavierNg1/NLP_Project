 Do not just get a follow back from a fake account of a celebrity by following them. Note that once who has a big tick after their name are said to be verified.;
, For example, RebelRevive tries to follow back its fans.
 For example, if you do not know Rebel Revive, still follow that account as your mission is to get a follow back from them.
 Say something nice to them, such as that you are his big fan. Use hashtags as well.
 Whether you like them or not praise them. Mention them to make them see your tweet.
 Timing is very important. Study when they are online. This works best with accounts that tweets at least one tweet per day.
 It will take some time to make verified accounts follow you back. So always wait.
 After getting a follow back, say thanks to them either on direct message or on a tweet by mentioning them. That will reduce the chance of being unfollowed.
 Always tweet to them and retweet or favorite their tweets.

 This will open the Control Center on your iOS device.
 A small pop-up menu will appear.
 This action enables you to mirror the screen on your iOS device to the TV.
 Once you select your Apple TV, you should see your iOS home screen on the big screen.
 You will see Chrome appear on both the TV and your mobile device. Now you can visit any website and have it appear on your TV.
 When you’re done using Chrome on your TV:


Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to launch the Control Center.
Select “AirPlay” from the menu.
Tap your iOS device. For example, if you’re using an iPad, tap “iPad.” Your iOS desktop will now disappear from the TV screen.

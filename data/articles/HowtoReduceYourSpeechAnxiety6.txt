 Instead of thinking how nervous you are, think of these feelings as excitement. You are excited about giving this speech and having the opportunity to share your thoughts and expertise on a topic.During your speech, use your nerves to energize your gestures and body movement. Try to keep it natural, however. Don’t pace around, but it’s okay to walk a bit if you feel comfortable doing so.
 Fear of public speaking is one of the most common phobias, but many of these people hide their nerves well enough that the audience isn’t aware of their anxieties. Don’t tell the audience that you’re nervous or anxious. If the audience perceives you as confident and positive, you will feel more confident and positive., Though many people think making eye contact will make their anxiety worse, it can actually reduce it. Simply find some friendly faces in the crowd and imagine that you are having a conversation with them. Allow their smiles to encourage you throughout the speech., Do not get hung up on mistakes. You may mispronounce something or stumble over some words, but do not let that bother you. Most people in the audience will not even notice. Set realistic expectations for yourself. Don’t beat yourself up if you make a mistake.

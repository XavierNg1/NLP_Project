 If you have all the racing games, how are you supposed to get better at first person shooting games? You should have one or two games in each genre. Some of the most popular genres are:


Action







Adventure







Racing














Sims (simulations)






Strategy
Other genres may include Sport games, Music games, Dancing games, Singing games, MOBA's etc.;
, It's also a good idea to get the most popular video games or the ones your friends have, such as:


Mario Kart







Call of Duty







Halo







, How do you shoot? How do you crouch? How do you jump? How do you pause the game? You can find the controls online or in the guide that comes with the video game. You can also customise your controls in most games. After you know all of the controls, practice each of them and make sure you can execute them with ease and quickly.
 As the saying goes, practice makes perfect. How are you supposed to improve your gaming skills if you don't even play video games that often?

, These can be extremely helpful, especially when you're competing against someone. Knowing shortcuts or tricks gives you an edge. You can easily find out some online.
 By watching them, you can learn tricks and shortcuts or something you didn't know before. Competing with them can help you see what you need to improve on and what you're getting better at.
 Review every step you take, what you were thinking at that moment. Compare your idea of what was happening and what was actually happening. Extremely helpful when playing games like shooters, strategy and racing games.

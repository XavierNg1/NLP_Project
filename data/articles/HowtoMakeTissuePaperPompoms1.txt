 It doesn't matter the color. You can use the same colors, vary different colors, or use similar-toned colors for a more flowery look.









The best places to get tissue paper are GIANT, AC Moore, Michaels, or general craft supply stores. In many stores you can find it in the packaging section where the wrapping paper is.;
, This should be the floor or a fairly large, cleared countertop.









Accordion fold together starting from the shorter side. Make sure the fold is creased and about 1-1/2 inch wide. Fold as if you were making a paper fan.
 Loop the wire around the center of the folded papers and twist.









This should be done once all the folding is finished. Cut the floral wire if there is too much excess.
If you desire a more modern, festive look, cut the edges to a point.
If you're going for a softer, flowery look, round the edges.
 Pull one by one and fluff up as you go.









Be careful! The tissue paper rips easily. Only do about half of the papers on each side so you end up with a ball.
 Make each side as even as possible.
 You may need to mess it around a bit to see how it falls.
 This makes your pompoms appear as if they're floating!









You may tie a length of monofilament to floral wire as an alternative.

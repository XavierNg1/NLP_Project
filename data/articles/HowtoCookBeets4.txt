 Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin from the beets before cooking them., The strips should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long and 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) thick. Wider strips will be easier to fry without burning, but they may take a little longer to cook through.
 Put 1/4 cup (60 ml) cornstarch in a metal or dark bowl. Avoid plastic bowls, since the raw beet juice is more likely to stain plastic. Add the beet strips to the bowl and gently toss them in the cornstarch using a fork until they are lightly coated.
 You will need about 4 inches (10 cm) of oil. Attach an instant-read candy thermometer on the side of the pot and continue heating the oil until it reaches 340 degrees Fahrenheit (171 degrees Celsius).
 Cook the beets in batches, adding no more than a handful of the strips into the oil at a time. Fry the beets until they are crisp and lightly browned outside but tender inside, about three to five minutes.
 Use a heat-resistant slotted spoon to remove the beets and drain the oil by placing them on plates lined with paper towels. Allow the beets to cool before serving.
 Enjoy these beets on their own, in a salad, or even use them to make borscht, a traditional Ukrainian beet soup.

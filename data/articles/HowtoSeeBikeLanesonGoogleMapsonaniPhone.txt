 Google will draw a green line over qualifying roads in different shades or compositions depending on the type of bike path available:


Light green - Normal street with bike paths.
Dark green - Bike paths available. No motor vehicles allowed.
Dotted green - Bike paths exist, but the street is not recommended for bike travel (e.g., too much traffic).
No green line - No bike paths available.
 You'll want to stick to the solid green lines between your location and your destination if at all possible.


You can type a location into the search bar to view bike lanes in an area other than your current one.

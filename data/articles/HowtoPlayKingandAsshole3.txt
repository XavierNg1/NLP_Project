 There are a number of alterations you can make to the general idea of passing. A couple extra regulations are common:


Some people play that if you can beat the previous play, you must. Passing is only allowed if you are unable to play. Typically, this makes the game less interesting and doesn't allow for strategy.
Some people do not allow a player who has passed to play at subsequent turns during the same trick. If you pass, you must wait until someone wins the trick and leads again. This can get rather boring for the person with an incredibly bad hand.
 If the people who play before you lay a 5 and then a 6 consecutively and you put 7, you can call "runs." Then the next cards will be forced to go in sequence, 5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A. If anyone can't contribute in order, they will be dropped out of the round.
 If you're playing this as a drinking game, you may want to up the ante. Odds are the King will want to search the depths of his mind for the most annoying, abuse-of-power rules out there, but here are a few to start off with:


Thumb Master: When the King puts his thumb down on the table, everyone must immediately follow suit. The last person to do so must drink.
Anyone who makes eye contact with the King must drink.
Before the hand starts, someone must give the King a toast (this is an opportune time to kiss-ass to the King). If no toast is presented, the King can give out his own punishment.
The King designates a player (or commands that the Asshole do so) to get everyone's drinks as long as he is ruler of the land.

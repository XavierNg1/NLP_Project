 You should have three tablespoons of fat. Place the pan with the fat back on the stove. Add three tablespoons of flour to the fat and stir.
 You should cook the mixture for one to two minutes, stirring constantly. Make sure to scrape any browned bits free from the bottom and sides of the pan.
 You will want to have 2 cups of dripping mixture. Measure how much drippings you have and then pour the drippings into a mixing bowl. Add the liquids of your choice so that you have two cups of drippings.


Add pork broth or stock to your drippings for a truly salty, pork flavor.
Add sherry or red for a more gourmet gravy. Gravies benefit from a bit of acidity. Wines or sherries add a depth of flavor to the gravy that comes from the addition of the acidity.
Some people enjoy making gravy by mixing the drippings with a can of cream of mushroom soup., Stir both mixtures in the pan over medium heat. The gravy should become smooth and thick. Add salt and pepper to taste.


If it is not thick enough for your taste, add another tablespoon of flour.
 Enjoy!

 If you have a fridge full of beer at home, chances are you will be tempted to drink it. Give away or throw out any beer that you still have in the house. Ask anyone else living with you or visiting you to respect your efforts by not bringing any more beer into your home., If you find yourself too tempted to drink in certain places or situations – for example, at parties, sporting events, or bars – then avoid those situations if you can. If you are unable to avoid going somewhere where you know you’ll be tempted, make a plan to help yourself resist the urge to grab a beer.Try asking a supportive friend to go with you as an accountability buddy.
Step outside for a few moments if you find yourself too tempted to drink.
If you have to, make an excuse to leave early.
 Hang out with friends and family who respect your desire to give up beer. If you know someone is going to offer you a beer, give you trouble about your decision not to drink, or tempt you by drinking in front of you, it may be best to avoid that person for awhile., You’ll be less tempted to drink beer if you’re keeping yourself busy doing other things. Use the time that you would otherwise spend drinking by doing something that you enjoy or working towards something you’d like to accomplish. Try picking up a new exercise routine, working on a creative project, or learning a new skill or hobby., If you feel tempted to drink beer, treat yourself to some other kind of refreshing treat or beverage. Try fruit juice, herbal tea, or an electrolyte-rich sports drink. Alcohol-free beer is also an option, if you really crave the taste of beer but want to avoid the alcohol content. However, keep in mind that many “alcohol removed” beers do contain a very small amount of alcohol.
 If you reach a major goal (like 30 days without a drink of beer), treat yourself. Use the money that you saved by not buying beer to buy yourself a nice gift or have a fun (and beer-free) evening out.

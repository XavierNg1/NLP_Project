 Mix one part vinegar with one part water in a clean, empty spray bottle. For example, 1 cup of vinegar and 1 cup of water will make a 16 ounce solution., Liberally spray the plastic with the vinegar solution completely soaking the plastic. Vinegar is good at removing grease, mildew, and hard water stains as well as disinfecting hard surfaces., Use a clean cloth or sponge to wipe the vinegar solutions around the plastic.


Spray more vinegar solution on areas with built up grime, and scrub them liberally until the dirt is removed.
 Use clean water to rinse the vinegar solution from the plastic; dry it with a towel.

 When she wakes up, she will be confused and scared.;
, When she wakes up she will feel very cold. To get a better effect, put an empty freezing cold ice cube tray underneath the mattress beside her.


She will now be scared if she has ever seen a horror movie. Now get inside her closet, keep it open and hide. Make sure you are wearing a mask then jump out when she wakes up, and scare her! She will scream, you will laugh, and then you will both laugh.

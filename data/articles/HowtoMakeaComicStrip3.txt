 Give your characters things that they want. Having established goals is a great way to drive story and create story lines when you're running low on ideas.
 You don't want characters that seem perfect. This strikes readers as being unrealistic and boring. If you want people to really sympathize with your characters and root for them, give them flaws.


They can be greedy, too talkative, rude, selfish, or not exactly smarter than your average bear.
 Give your characters backgrounds, interests, hobbies, and other things that show that they have actual lives. This makes them seem more real and relatable.
 Fight the cliches! Don't make them boring

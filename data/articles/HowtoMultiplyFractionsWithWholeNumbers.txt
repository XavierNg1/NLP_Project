 To rewrite a whole number as a fraction, simply place the whole number over 1.


To rewrite 5 as a fraction, just write 5/1. 5 becomes the numerator, while 1 is the denominator; but the value remains the same.;
, To get the numerator of your answer, you simply have to multiply the numerator of the first fraction with the numerator of the second fraction.
 To get the denominator of your answer, you simply have to multiply the denominator of the first fraction with the denominator of the second fraction.


Multiply the denominators of 5/1 and 8/10 by multiplying 1 * 10. The answer is 10, so your new denominator will be 10.
After multiplying the numerators and denominators of your fractions, your answer will be in fraction form, with the new numerator over the new denominator. The answer is 40/10.
 To simplify a fraction, you have to write it in its lowest terms. You can do this by dividing the numerator and denominator by the same factor. In this case, both 40 and 10 are divisible by 10. 40/10 = 4 and 10/10 = 1, so your new answer is 4/1, or just 4.


If your answer is 4/6, for example, you can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2 to get 2/3.

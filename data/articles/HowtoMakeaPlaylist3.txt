 A new playlist will appear in the left navigation menu.
 When you create the playlist, the name will automatically be highlighted, allowing you to enter any name you want.
 The beauty of Spotify playlists is that you can add any song from the Spotify library, and then share those playlists with your friends. Use the Spotify search to find any song, artist, album that you can think. The music must be available on Spotify in order for you to add it.


Click and drag the files that you want onto your playlistâ€™s icon.
 Any new songs you add will be placed at the bottom of the playlist. You can click and drag songs to move them around the playlist and create the order that you want.
 With Spotify you can share your playlist with anyone and they can listen to it with their Spotify program. To share your playlist, right-click on it and select Share. You will be able to share with Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter.

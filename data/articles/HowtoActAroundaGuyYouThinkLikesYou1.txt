 If a guy is giving you signals, return them by getting a little snuggly on your end. Try to sit close to him at social events. When talking to him between classes or during lunch, stand a little closer to him than you normally would. This sends the signal you like him back and enjoy being near him., Solo time with your crush can help you assess if he likes you. It can also send the message you're interested in him as well. Try to find ways to get him alone so the two of you can have a chance to make your feelings clear.For example, text him something like, "I'm really craving a burger. Want to run and get a snack after class?"

, Paying a guy you think likes you extra attention on social media can let him know you like him back. Try leaving comments on his pictures and posts on sites like Instagram and Facebook. Respond to his tweets on Twitter and re-tweet the ones you find interesting.Work in some mild flirtation with your comments. For example, "Cute pic! Blue is a great color on you."

, If he flirts with you, flirt back. Common flirting tactics include making eye contact, flashing a smile, flashing your eyebrows, and casual touching.If these gestures are coming your way, return them.


For example, if your crush brushes your arm, wait a few moments. Then, do something like tussle his hair or place your hand on his knee.
 Remember, if a guy already likes you, you don't need to change. Be your unique self around him and don't be afraid to let your inhibitions down. Feel free to get a little goofy or wild around him, as this is likely to endear you to him more.For example, if you're a fan of a certain musical artist that's a little obscure, don't be afraid to talk about this in front of the guy. If you like a unique type of movie, invite him to watch these movies with you.

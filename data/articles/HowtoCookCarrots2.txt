 Young/baby, fresh and early season carrots do not need blanching. Older carrots from the end of the season may need to be blanched to reduce their bitterness; taste test a raw one to see first.
 Cut according to the needs of your recipe.
 Bring the water to the boil.
 Much older, larger carrots may need 10-12 minutes.
 They're now ready to be used as directed.

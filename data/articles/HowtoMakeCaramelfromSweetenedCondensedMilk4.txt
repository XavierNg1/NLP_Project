 Remove the label from the can of sweetened condensed milk. Place the unopened can on its side directly on the bottom of the pressure cooker. Fill the pressure cooker with enough water to fully immerse the can and cover it with an extra inch (two-and-a-half cm) of water.


Do not exceed the maximum fill line on your pressure cooker.
 Heat on high until the pressure cooker reaches the proper pressure. Immediately lower the heat slightly, but keep the temperature high enough that the pressure cooker maintains pressure.


You want the heat high enough to simmer the water, but not so high that the pressure cooker whistles.
 When the 40 minutes are up, remove the pressure cooker from the heat., Allow the pressure cooker to naturally release its steam and reduce its pressure, or with the quick release valve. Do not open the pressure cooker until all the steam has been released and the pressure has dropped.
 Use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove the can from the water and place it on a wire rack. Allow it to cool to room temperature, and donâ€™t open the can until it has.

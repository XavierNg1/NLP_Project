 Use your device’s native browser app or other third-party applications like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, or Dolphin browser, and look for a rooting software on the Internet.


One application that you can use on your ZTE phone is “Framaroot.” Framaroot lets users root their phones even without the help of a computer.;
, You can download the Framaroot software from this link: http://framaroot.net/. Click the link of the latest version displayed on the web page to download the APK installer file to your phone.
 Open your phone’s file manager application, and navigate to the location on your phone where the Framaroot app has been downloaded. Tap the APK file to start installing the application on your phone.


If your ZTE phone is not set to install third-party applications, a prompt will appear asking confirmation to install Framaroot. Simply enable the “Unknown Sources” option on the prompt to continue.
 Tap the app icon from your device’s home screen to launch Framaroot.
 Framaroot will ask you to select from three kinds of exploits that will root your phone, namely Sam, Frodo, and Aragorn. You can choose any of these three. Simply tap the exploit of your choice to start using it.


Some exploits will not work depending on the model and version of Android OS your ZTE phone is running on. When this happens, a message prompt will appear on the screen telling you that the exploit “failed.” When this occurs, simply choose another one from the three, and keep selecting until you get to open the one that works.
 Once you get to a working exploit, it will take only a few seconds to root your ZTE phone. After the process is complete, a message will appear notifying you that the exploit is successful, and super-user settings have been installed on your device.
 Framaroot will require you to restart your device to apply the changes made on the phone settings. Press and hold the Power button to reboot your newly rooted ZTE phone.

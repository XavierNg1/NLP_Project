 If necessary, one of you should get up and start the day much earlier than usual with your baby as they begin to adjust to the time difference. This is better than bringing them into your bed. Remember that if your baby's sleep is disturbed, the chances are that yours will be too!

, On the following day, allow plenty of sleeping during the early part of the day, this nap may be far longer than usual. Then restrict afternoon napping and put them to bed closer to local “bedtime”.
 Try following your baby's lead and soon you will all have adapted to the time change.

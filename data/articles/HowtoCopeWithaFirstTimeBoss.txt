 Mutual respect is constructive to all parties involved, and it will help you get off on the right foot with this person.


Treat your new boss as you would like to be treated.
Avoid office gossip surrounding this person.
Don't go over this person's head if you have an issue. Address it politely with him or her to resolve the issue together instead of trying to sidestep him or her.;

You may prefer phone or face-to-face conversation, but a first-time boss may be right out of college and prefer email, texting, Skype, social networking or some other means of communicating.
Embrace the new communication methods, but don't be afraid to implement your own preferences as well. Finding a balance will be the key to happiness for both you and your new boss.
 Popping into his office for something when that person has a regularly-scheduled meeting that he is already running late to will only cause internal resentment toward you. Instead, observe and learn his routine to be more timely with your interaction with that person.
 Let the new boss know that you are available if he has any questions, but don't give advice without being asked. You don't want to come off as trying too hard or for making yourself seem better than that person.
 A first-time boss is bound to screw up at some point, but by keeping a paper trail of your correspondence, requests and more, you can ensure that the problem is not your fault or that the blame cannot be shifted back to you.
 By showing that you are a top performer, you can work to not be micromanaged as critically as others who are not holding up quite as well as you are.
 If a certain way works better for you, after the initial introductory period has worn off, sit down and have an honest conversation with your boss about what learning and managing style works best for you.

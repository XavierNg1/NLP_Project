 Check your desk, backpack, briefcase or junk drawer for a graphite pencil. For best results, you’ll want to use a traditional wooden pencil rather than one of the mechanical variety—the broader tip will make it easier to get the graphite onto the zipper.Graphite naturally makes a very effective dry lubricant., Hold the zipper together with one hand while you work. Continue rubbing until you can see the graphite being left behind on the teeth. Focus on the line where the teeth intersect, as this is where most zippers get jammed.








Only apply a light amount of pressure to avoid breaking the tip of the pencil.
The loose graphite particles will coat the edges of the teeth, making it easier for them to lock and unlock.
 Test the zipper a few times by pulling it with slow, smooth motions. It should be able to glide freely once you get it started. When you’re finished, wash your hands and wipe off any remaining graphite with a paper towel to keep it from getting all over the surrounding fabric.








Don’t attempt to force the zipper. This may result in damage to the fabric or the zipper itself.
 If the pencil trick doesn’t work right away, keep trying. There may not be enough graphite on the teeth to get the zipper moving after a single attempt. Alternate between rubbing the pencil and sliding the zipper back and forth until you see progress.









If you’re still encountering resistance after applying a second coating of graphite, move on to a different method.

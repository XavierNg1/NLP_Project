 This procedure is best for small spider veins. A saline (salt water) solution is injected into the vein. It hardens and the vein effectively disappears.
 A blast of laser can make very small spider veins disappear.
 These large, and sometimes painful, veins may require more serious treatment such as laser surgery, endovenous thermal ablation, vein stripping, endoscopic vein surgery and other procedures.


Treatments, aftercare and risks should be thoroughly discussed with a physician experiences in these specialties.

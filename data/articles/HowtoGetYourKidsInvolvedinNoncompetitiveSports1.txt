 If your kid is very young, you can try them out in whatever sport you feel comfortable with to see if it's a good fit. It's also a good idea to think about what would be a good fit for your child; if they don't seem to like playing catch, maybe t-ball isn't for them. If your kid is a bit older, you might ask them or let them try a few different sports to see what they enjoy the most., Many cities have leagues that aren't competitive, especially for younger kids. Look at the parks and recreation department, for instance, or contact your local YMCA. You'll likely be able to find a noncompetitive league in your area that places the emphasis on fun and fitness rather than competition., Many schools have sports clubs for kids who don't want to play on the school team. These clubs offer a way for kids to be involved in a sport without competition being as much of an emphasis.

 20 minutes of shower time per day - a conservative estimate for many multi-person households - can add up to 700 gallons of water a week. To frame that in terms of conservation, that’s the equivalent of three years worth drinking water for one person. It will also lead to considerable hot water heating costs, which will vary based on your location.Keep showers to five minutes maximum. Two or three minutes should be plenty to wash up.
Short showers will use much less water than baths. If you do take a bath, only fill it up as much as is necessary to wash.Taking cooler showers will also save you water heating costs, though water cost and conservation are important to be aware of as well.;
, In particular, use the “economy” setting on your washing machines, and choose short washing cycles if you have the option. Only run clothes or dish washing machines with a full load.If your dishwasher is equipped with a booster heater, turn it on.
Dish washing machines use less water than hand-washing, if used efficiently. If you are washing dishes by hand, fill a washtub with soapy water instead of letting the faucet run.
Use cold water for the majority of clothes washing cycles. Always choose cold water for the rinse cycle.
Replace an old or inefficient machine with a more energy efficient model. For information on doing so, see the corresponding section in this article.
 It can be tempting to let the water run while warming up a shower, or while brushing your teeth. This not only wastes water, it costs you money. Get in the habit of rinsing your toothbrush for a moment, and turning the faucet off aside from quick rinses while brushing.

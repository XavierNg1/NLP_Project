 Look directly behind the Taillight assembly for two plastic interior snap covers that have a small slit opening in them.
 Gently pop each of them off. Behind each cover, you will see a small 10MM or 8MM nut attached to the taillight assembly stud., You can use a 10MM or 8MM socket, small extension drive and a ratchet., You can use the open end wrench or a flex socket adapter., Once both nuts are removed, proceed to the outside of the taillight assembly and gently insert a flat head screwdriver between the taillight and vehicles body, starting at the bottom of the Taillight. Slowly pry very slightly under the Taillight until it starts to move away from the body. Start at the bottom then the middle of the Taillight., Once the Taillight has slightly moved away from the body grab the Taillight and gently pull it away from the vehicle. If it doesn't move, gently pry very slightly a few more times until it does., With the Taillight in your hand, locate the Taillight bulb socket and turn it counter clock wise until it releases from the Taillight. With the socket in your hand, carefully grab the bulb and pull it out of the socket and insert a new one., With the new bulb installed, gently insert the socket into the Taillight assembly. Turn the socket clock wise until it clicks into the Taillight assembly and does not spin anymore., Carefully align the studs of the Taillight with the holes in the body of the vehicle and push the Taillight assembly back into the car, making sure it sits flush with the body of the vehicle., Once the Taillight is installed into the body of the vehicle, replace both 10-8mm nuts on the Taillight studs and snap back into place both interior covers., If so, you have successfully changed a Taillight bulb in a Nissan Versa Hatchback.

 If you suspect that a cat has a broken limb, look at it closely, but avoid moving the limb, as this may worsen the severity of the fracture. You can determine if a limb is broken internally (a closed fracture) by the cat’s inability to use it properly, or if the limb is twisted or bent at an unnatural angle. If bone is sticking out through the skin, the animal has an open fracture.If a cat has broken ribs, the chest cavity may appear misshapen or flattened in one or more spots.
 If a cat has an open fracture on one of its limbs, prevent dirt and bacteria from getting in the wound by wrapping it loosely with sterile gauze or a clean cloth. If you tighten the wrapping you’ll only cause the animal more pain, so leave the wrapping loose.Do not try to apply a splint to the fractured bone. Although a veterinarian or animal specialist may do this at a pet hospital, it shouldn’t be part of your first aid treatment. In applying a splint, you risk worsening the fracture or forcing the bone through the animal’s skin.
 The cat will need to stay as immobile as possible, in order to avoid worsening the fracture. To facilitate this, place the cat inside a rigid, large plastic or cardboard box. The box will keep the cat from hurting itself further, and should keep the fractured limb relatively motionless.If possible, line the inside of the box with towels. This will keep the cat relatively comfortable, and also prevent it from sliding around the inside of the box.
 Fractures—especially open fractures—are dangerous, painful, and can lead to death in some cases. Call ahead on the road so that the vet knows you’re coming.Explain that the situation is an emergency, and that the cat will need immediate treatment.

 This breed tends to be on the energetic and athletic side and will typically exhibit a much more even temperament when they receive proper amounts of exercise. Without exercise, you may have a bored and potentially destructive dog on your hands.


Daily exercise should consist of 30-40 minutes of varied activity that can include, but is not limited to, running, hiking, swimming, weight-pulling, and agility.
 Because of the facial structure of this breed, their "smushed" face means that they have narrow nasal passages. This can make it more difficult, than many other breeds, for them to breathe and to remain cool. Keep this in mind when you are exercising your dog on a hot day or for long periods of time. Be sure to allow for several water and cool-down breaks.


If you think that your American Bulldog is becoming overheated or can't catch its breath, this could be an emergency situation that will need medical assistance from your veterinarian.
 A Bulldog will not be happy lounging on the couch all day with no exercise. In that type of situation, it is easy for an American Bulldog to become overweight, which can lead to a variety of health issues, such as diabetes and injuries to their knees and hips.
 They have a natural tendency to play rough, so do not be surprised if your Bulldog plays and romps with vigor and occasionally sends things flying, including people. Have fun with your pup during exercise, but be careful too!

 Before you talk to them about their obsession, you’ll need to ponder the issue. Without thinking about the problem, you won’t be able to properly articulate your concerns to your partner.


Ask yourself why their phone obsession bothers you. For instance, ask yourself whether their phone obsession is a temporary thing or does it represent a larger problem in your relationship.
Think about whether your relationship has had more problems since your partner got their smart phone or if those problems existed before.
Consider if they are really obsessed with their phone. For instance, think about whether they are wasting time playing with their phone or if they are doing work-related activities., By listing the reasons, you’ll get yourself ready for talking to your partner about their phone obsession. Some problems might be:


They play with their phone rather than listening to you. Thus, conversations with your partner seem one-sided.
Your partner is unable to fulfill their obligations like work and chores because they spend too much time fiddling on their phone.
The person neglects paying attention to and loving pets and children because they play with their phone.
Your partner spends a lot of money on smart phone games, apps, or in-app purchases., Before talking to your partner about their phone usage, you need to think carefully about your own habits. Ultimately, you shouldn’t approach your partner about their phone usage if you engage in the same behavior.


Spend some time, days or even a few weeks, considering your own usage. Try to note if you use your smart phone during mealtime, while others are talking to you, or during other important events.
Ask close friends or family what they think of your usage. For instance, ask your best friend “Do you think I’m obsessed with my smart phone?”
Track your data usage. If you use a lot of data, or as much data as your partner, you may have similar usage patterns as them.

 If you already know you're going to a theme park that is known to have long lines, or if you're going there during the peak season (school breaks, summer, etc.), then you should prepare yourself by bringing things for the wait such as a book, mp3 player, magazine, cell phone, etc.
 You may see a roller-coaster from a distance that you may think you really want to go on, but you should really get closer to it and take a look at the rules and what it is about. Choose carefully, because you might regret waiting a long time for a ride you found boring.

In outdoor rides, if you are unsure whether you should ride the ride, watch it go a couple times. While the entire ride may not be visible to you, parts of it will most likely be. This will aid you in your decision.
 Before you get in the line, take a look at the wait time sign if they have one, and ask yourself "Is it really worth the wait?" If it is, go ahead and go in the line. If not, leave and find other ride that suits your interests.

The amount of time you should wait for a ride really depends on you and anyone else in your group. If you have people with you that you know simply cannot stand waiting, then if the wait seems a bit long, it may be best to skip the ride and come back to it later.
 If the sun is blazing, do your best to cover your head. This is because if you're way to hot, you're more likely to realize if the line is moving slowly or not. Your best bet is to check the weather before you leave. If you see it's going to be 100 degrees, then dress lightly and bring a hat. If it's going to rain, bring an umbrella. Weather may not always be correct, but it is better to be safe than sorry.
 If you're over-excited about the ride and want the line to move faster, slip on your headphones and listen to either a slow song, or one of your favorites. Doing this will likely distract you in a good way, because you'll be hearing music instead of focusing on all the people in the line.

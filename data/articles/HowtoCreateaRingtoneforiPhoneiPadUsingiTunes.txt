 Download and install iTunes from Apple’s website.  It is a program to interact with your iDevices on computer and transfer data between them.;
, After launching iTunes, connect your device to computer via the cable.  The device’s icon will show up instantly on top left of iTunes and do some initial setups.



If you already have music on your computer that you want to use, drag your songs in the folder into “Music” under “Library” (on the left column).
 Now you may be able to enjoy your MP3s in the “Music” app of your iPhone/iPad.
 Right click on the song you choose → Get Info → Options.  Here, extract your best segment by deciding the starting and ending time of the ringtone.  Remember the length must not exceed 40 seconds.  Then click “OK”.



Continue to right click on that song → Create AAC version.  A shorter version with the same audio quality will appear under the original one.
Right click on the AAC version → Show in Windows Explorer.  Rename the ending of the file to “.m4r” format. To show the file format, go to View → check “File Name Extensions” box.
Drag the renamed file into “Tone” tab in iTunes.  The tab should be opened first.



From “Tone” tab, drag the ringtone file to the device’s icon.
On your iPhone/iPad, go to Settings → Sounds → Ringtone → pick the one that you have just made.
Enjoy “like a boss” when someone calls in, and make more for fun.

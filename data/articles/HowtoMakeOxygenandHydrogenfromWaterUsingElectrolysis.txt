, Salt helps conduct electricity better through water. (However this may produce amounts of chlorine gas due to the chloride anomaly. This will not produce significant volumes of the gas unless massive current is applied.)








, Poke two thin electrical wires, approximately 1-2 feet/30-60cm long, through the cardboard about 2 inches/5cm apart so that one end of the wire is approximately 2-3 inches/5-7cm submerged in the water.
 Bubbles will soon begin to form on the submerged ends of the wires, hydrogen gas on negative wire and oxygen on the positive wire.
 You will require, in addition to the previously stated items, a smaller container (a syringe is best) and something with which to suspend the smaller container upside down (tape works adequately).
 without removing the glass from the water; or, bringing the opening above the water level of the big glass, flip the smaller glass so that the opening faces toward the bottom of the larger glass. (If using a syringe, simply put the opening into the glass and pull the plunger, filling the syringe with water, and skip to Step 9).
 If done correctly, the smaller glass should protrude from the water's surface, but it will be filled with water (it is being suspended by pressure).

 It could be a den or a bedroom no one uses too frequently. Anywhere that is relaxing and away from the busy parts of the house (like the living room or kitchen) will work!;
, Never try to make a game room around a bed. Even if you end up moving it back, you want to do this first so you know how you want to structure the room.
 Do you want to play video games? Do you want a place to play poker or pool? It's up to you!

, Make sure to have lots of empty room and don't over-clutter yourself or you will not enjoy the room to its full potential

, If you are considering getting video games, the console doesn't matter as much as the actual games. Make sure to get games that will satisfy a broad audience. Adrenaline junkies will love games like Call of Duty, Tekken or Halo. Whereas more casual gamers will enjoy Rock Band or Burnout. You want to have a variety so everyone will be happy. Also, make sure you like the games too. After all, it is YOUR game room.
 These might include Tron or Star Wars Trilogy.
 Go crazy! Get accessories like posters for upcoming video games or movies! Lounge in bean bag chairs. Do what you want. Your limit is your creativity.

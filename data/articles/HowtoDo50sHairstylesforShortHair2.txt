 Use a brush to divide your hair into four sections. There should be one section in front, one on either side of your head, and one in the back at the nape of your neck. Once your hair is sectioned, use clips to secure your hair.The rough size of each section depends on the thickness of your hair. Thicker hair will have bigger sections.
 Unclip one section at a time. Use a heated curling iron to curl the sections at the side and front of your head into a series of tiny curls. Leave the section at the nape of your neck undone. When you're done curling each section, secure it in hair clips or hair ties again.Get as many curls in as possible as you curl each section.
 Use a mirror to braid the hair near the nape of your neck. You can also ask a friend to braid this hair for you. Braid your hair as tightly as possible, keeping the hair secured to the back of your neck. When you're done, section off your hair with clips or hair ties., Release the other three curled sections of hair. Use a brush or your fingers to gently comb out each section, creating light and gentle curls., Take some hair tissues. Divide your hair into two sections, sort of like you're creating pigtails, and then wrap a tissue around each section of hair to keep it secure and out of the way., Start with one side of your hair. Pull the tissue out gradually. As you pull out the tissue, roll your hair under itself. This should create the curled, bob effect that reminiscent of the 50's., Repeat the same process on the other side of your head. Remove the tissue slowly and, as you do so, curl your hair under to create a bob effect., Mist on a generous amount of hair spray. This should keep your hair rolled under itself and keep your curls in tact. When you're done, you should have a neat '50s-inspired bob.

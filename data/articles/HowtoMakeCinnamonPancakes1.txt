 To make these basic cinnamon pancakes, you will need your ingredients, a medium mixing bowl, a whisk or electric beaters, and a griddle or frying pan.;
, Add some extra oil or butter to the frying pan to lightly coat the bottom. Heat the oil over medium to high heat while you prepare the batter.
 In your mixing bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients, including the egg or egg replacer.Suitable egg replacers for this recipe include:2 1/2 tablespoons (37.5 g) ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons (45 ml) water.
1/2 a mashed or pureed banana.
1 1/2 teaspoons (7.5 g) Ener-G Egg replacer mixed with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) water.
 Continue whisking or beating the liquids as you incorporate the dry ingredients. Donâ€™t overmix the batter, or you could end up with chewy pancakes. A few lumps in the batter are acceptable., Unless you have a large frying pan, make one pancake at a time. Pour a quarter-cup (60 ml) of batter into the frying pan and let it cook. When bubbles begin to form and cover the top side of the pancake, flip it over and cook for another two minutes. You want both sides to be golden brown.


Add a bit more oil and repeat until all the pancakes are cooked.
 If you want to wait until all the pancakes are cooked before serving, keep them warm in a warming drawer, on a plate covered in foil, or on a cookie sheet in a low oven.

 Mix 1 part cream of tartar with 1 part lemon juice in a small bowl to make a paste.Be sure that your solution is thoroughly mixed throughout the solution before applying it to your stain.


Cream of tartar is most useful for removing deep-colored stains, like blood, from leather., You should apply the paste with a toothbrush and gently rub on the blood stain. Allow your paste to sit for 10 minutes before removing it., You can use a damp rag to brush off the paste. If the stain remains, try re-applying your paste until the stain is gone or you no longer remove anything from the discolored area.
 Use a clean damp cloth to rinse off what remains of your cleaning paste. Make sure to rinse the area thoroughly, as leaving behind your cleaning paste might do damage to your leather upholstery.
 Use a dry towel to soak up any excess moisture left over from your rinsing. When you have absorbed all the moisture you are able, you should allow the area to air dry.
 This will help prevent future stains and seal some added moisture into the leather to prevent it from cracking over time. You can find leather conditioner at most hardware and auto stores, or in the auto section of larger retailers.

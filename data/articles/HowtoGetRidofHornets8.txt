 Depending on where the hornets made their nest, there are several possible approaches to making it seem different to them, and therefore hopefully deterring them from rebuilding the nest. These include:


Cutting down branches, bushes and even a tree
Repainting a wall, eave, birdhouse, other items around the home
Putting up sparkly, sun-catching mobiles, mirrors or CDs in the vicinity of the demolished/removed nest.
Changing some other element dramatically around the garden or home where the hornets were hanging around.
 Purchase an artificial nest from a hardware store. The theory is that hornets that see an existing nest will keep away because they're territorial. Replace the artificial nest every year, to ensure that it looks intact and is neat.
 Hence, don't feed pets or leave pet food anywhere around the area where hornets have previously congregated.


Keep garbage covered at all times. Not only will this deter hornets but it will keep away all manner of yard pests.

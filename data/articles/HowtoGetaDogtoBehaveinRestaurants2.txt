 Barking is unacceptable behavior for dogs at restaurants, including dog-friendly restaurants. Before bringing your dog to a restaurant, make sure it knows the “quiet” command. To teach your dog the quiet command you will first need to teach it to bark on cue., Make your dog bark by either making a barking sound, or by doing something that sets off the barking, like ringing the doorbell or knocking on the door. While your dog is barking, say a cue word, like “speak” and give your dog a treat.To reinforce the speak command, use a distinctive hand signal that will cue the command, for example, like waiving your hand or a pointer finger in the air.
Say, “speak,” again until your dog begins to bark. Reward it for barking by giving it a treat.
Repeat this step until your dog understands the “speak” command.
 Once your dog can reliably bark on command, introduce the “quiet” command. In a calm environment with little distractions, firmly tell your dog to “speak.” Your dog should begin barking. When your dog begins to bark say, “quiet,” with a distinctive hand gesture. When your dog stops barking, wait a couple seconds, then give it a treat.If your dog keeps barking, wait until it stops barking, reward it with a treat. Remember to wait a couple seconds before giving it a treat so it can associate the correct behavior with the treat.
Add a second or two of silence every day before you give it a treat. Try to work your way up to 10 seconds of silence before giving it a treat.
 Reinforce the idea that silence is a desirable trait by actively seeking out your dog and rewarding it for being silent throughout the day. Try to do this once or twice a day.For example, if your dog is silently sitting by your feet, reward it with affection and/or treats for being good. While petting your dog you can say, “That’s a good girl (or boy),” and give it a treat.

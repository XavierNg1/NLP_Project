 To highlight a tree that has a large amount of dense foliage, you can use above-ground spotlights. Position the spotlight (you can use 1 or several) a good distance away from the tree's trunk and aim it upwards towards the foliage. This will create a dramatic, looming effect that accents the tree's size and grandeur.;
, Another technique that allows you to highlight a tree with large, bushy foliage is to position the spotlight very close to the trunk and aim it almost vertically. This effect, rather than dramatizing the foliage, highlights the texture and form of the tree's trunk and branches. Use this technique when you want to accent a tree with an interesting trunk shape.
 Small, spindly, or narrow trees will often not appear as dramatic when lighted using the above spotlight technique. Instead, use in-ground lights positioned directly by the tree's trunk and facing upwards. This technique gives small trees like palms a dramatic impact that belies their diminutive size.
 If you have a tree with lots of loose foliage, consider placing a spotlight facing downwards directly onto one of the tree's branches. This will cast enchanting shadows of the tree's foliage onto the surrounding ground, creating an elegant moonlit effect.
 If you have a tree that is placed near the wall of your home, try placing a bright spotlight in front of it and aiming it towards the wall. This will cast a dramatic shadow of the tree's form onto the wall. This technique is especially suited for trees with interesting shapes as well as shrubs and topiary.


Because this technique provides a wash of light over the wall of your house, it also contributes to the increased security of your home.
If lit from below, trees will cast a dramatic shadow up onto the wall that appears larger than the plant's actual size. For a more subtle effect, try lighting from above or using multiple lights to soften the individual shadows.

 Wide leg pants are best suited on the average height to taller women. Sorry ladies, but if you are shorter with a wider build then it may best to avoid this style of pants or go with a pair that has a very subtle flare. Start about knee height to avoid adding the appearance of width. Taller women luck out here and have multiple options to choose from as there is less chance the flared pants or wide leg jeans will make them appear heavier.
 If you add too much volume on the top of the outfit it will take away from the wide leg pants and visually give you a heavier look. Slightly fitted tops that show your silhouette and do not extend past the hips will give you the best results. Remember to wear these pants with a belt to keep definition at your waist., Go with dark blue, black or brown, Definitely, you will need heels, pumps or boots to add height. Paired with some flared or wide leg pants, this will help you appear taller and more slender. Avoid flats or sandals as they will have the opposite effect which for most women is not desirable., Make sure you take along a friend that can give you her honest opinion on how the pants look on you.,

 Find shirts that have full sleeves and drape over the body in a very comfortable and loose-fitting style, like tunics and caftans. Alternatively, go for tie-dye shirts and tank tops, as well as turtlenecks.


Choose tops in white or earth tones like brown, green, and tan. It generally wasn’t until later in the hippies movement and the next decade that colors and patterns were brighter.Try wearing a leotard, undershirt, or other garment meant as activewear or underwear as a top.Consider going without a bra underneath your shirt, as it was very popular for female hippies to abandon this item of clothing.;
, Opt for a mini skirt in a shift or a-line cut for a ‘60s look. Or wear a longer, flowing skirt made from cotton or another light material. Choose dresses that are also light and flowing, in earth tones or floral patterns.


If you wear a mini skirt, try it with black, colored, or patterned tights on underneath.
Floor-length flowing maxi dresses were a popular style, as well as shorter caftan-style dresses with full sleeves.
Try dresses and skirts in floral, paisley, or animal print patterns.
 Go for bellbottoms with the classic wide leg at the bottom, or simply regular jeans in a relaxed fit. Try pants made of corduroy or crushed velvet as well.


Look for earthy colors or jewel tones in pants, like brown, dark green, yellow, or maroon.
 Top your outfit with a large vest or suede jacket with fringe on the sleeves and back.


Look for nylon, velvet/velveteen, batik, satin, fur, chiffon, hemp, and polyester as popular material for jackets, coats, and tops as well.
For warmer layers, try a long maxi coat or poncho. Or for the look that many used to protest and ironize the military in the ‘60s, don a green or camo army jacket.

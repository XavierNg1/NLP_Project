 Many individuals and businesses rely on certified public accountants (CPAs), attorneys, or national tax preparation chains to prepare their tax returns. You may want to meet with various tax professionals before choosing one to hire, to make sure that they can properly handle your taxes and meet your tax preparation needs.
 This may include copies of your W-2 (or other tax forms), receipts, registration slips, etc. Be sure you provide a phone number where the person can reach you in the event of questions or missing information.
 You should also come up with a timeline and check back in with the tax professional at specified times. Additionally, make sure you schedule an appointment to pick up and review your completed taxes.
 You and the tax professional should go over the completed return to make sure that you understand everything related to the taxes. Once you are satisfied, sign and date each return.
 You can have the professional file the returns electronically or mail them. If you owe the government money remember to enclose a check with your return made out to the U.S. Treasury.
 If you chose to e-file, the IRS will typically automatically deposit any refund into the provided account within 4 to 8 days.

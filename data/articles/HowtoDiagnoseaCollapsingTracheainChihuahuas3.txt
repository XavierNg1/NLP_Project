 The trachea, also known as the windpipe, is the tube that takes the air from mouth or nose to the lungs.When a trachea collapses, instead of the rings maintaining a totally open pipe or tube, they collapse or squash down.


When this happens, water cannot pass along and it makes it difficult for air to flow along.
The trachea can collapse because the cartilage rings are badly formed and are too wide and narrow, because the ligament filling the gap is too long and floppy, or due to a combination of both of these factors.The lining of the windpipe is very sensitive, and in a Chihuahua, this flattening can make the dog cough.
Small breeds, such as the Chihuahua, are most at risk, probably because of a genetic tendency for the rings to be malformed. Other breeds commonly affected include Yorkshire terriers, Pomeranians, Shih Tzus, Maltese terriers, toy poodles, and pugs., Collapsed tracheas can happen at any age. However, the condition generally appears around six to seven years of age.Keep an eye on your chihuahua as he ages.
 One reason dogs might end up with a collapsed trachea is from the owner pulling on the collar. Jerking the collar or using a choke chain can put enough pressure on the windpipe with force that can cause it to collapse.


Use a dog harness instead of a collar when using a leash on your dog.

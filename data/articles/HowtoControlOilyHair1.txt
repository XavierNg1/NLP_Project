 You may think that using a strong shampoo is the best option for oily hair. However, harsh shampoos can actually strip too much oil, causing your scalp to produce even more. Opt for a mild shampoo that will clean excess oil without irritating the hair follicle.Look for a shampoo that is free of silicone and sulfates for the best results.
When you wash your hair, let the shampoo sit on your scalp for a few minutes before rinsing it. That will give it time to penetrate the oils and remove them.;
, When you have oily hair, you usually feel the need to wash everyday. However, that can actually cause your scalp to produce more oil. Try to cut down on your use of shampoo by working a rinse-only day when you just rinse your hair with lukewarm water into your routine.Use a rinse-only day every other time or every third time that you plan to wash your hair to get your hair used to less shampooing.
Your scalp will eventually adjust to less shampoo and stop producing as much oil, so you can wash every other day or less.
 While it’s important to use a gentle shampoo that won’t cause your hair to produce more oil, both oil and styling products can build up on your hair, making it look greasy, dull, and limp. Use a clarifying shampoo once a month to remove the buildup and add shine and volume back to your hair.Clarifying shampoo can be extremely harsh, which can trigger excess oil production. Never use it more than once a month.
 Even oily hair can have dry ends, so you don’t necessarily want to skip conditioner completely. However, when you’re applying it, focus it only on the ends of your hair. Never put any near your scalp and roots.You don’t necessarily need to condition your hair every time you wash either. You may only want to use conditioner once a week if your ends aren’t particularly dry.

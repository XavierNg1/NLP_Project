 One of the early signs of relapse is thinking about using drugs and/or alcohol. This may be accompanied by a change in attitude towards using.For example, your fearful thoughts about using and becoming addicted again may be replaced by a strong desire to use.


Write about any thoughts you are having about using. What have you been thinking about doing? When do you have these thoughts?

, Being around drugs and/or paraphernalia can trigger a desire to use in some people, which is why it is a good idea to remove all substances and paraphernalia from your home. You should also avoid situations where you might be exposed to substances and/or paraphernalia.If you find that you are triggered by other things, you can write about them in your journal.


Write about any people, places, objects, situations, or other things that seem to trigger a desire to use. For example, you might find that a certain person who you used to use with might trigger your desire to use. Describe the thoughts and feelings that you have when you see this person.
 One of the more subtle signs that can indicate a relapse is a change in your mood and/or attitude.For example, you might go from feeling happy to feeling depressed. Or, you might go from feeling grateful that you are in recovery to feeling resentful that you have to go to meetings.


Record any changes in your attitude and/or mood by writing about them in your journal.
 To reduce the chances of a relapse, make sure that you talk to your counselor or sponsor about any relapse signs that you have noticed.Be honest about your thoughts and feelings when you share with your counselor or sponsor. Sharing what you have recorded in your journal may help you to prevent a relapse.

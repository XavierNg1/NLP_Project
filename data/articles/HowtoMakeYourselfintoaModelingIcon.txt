 Find out what's happening in the fashion industry. Agents look for a serious interest in modeling, so don't look stupid! Do your homework. Read high-fashion magazines like Vogue and Elle, or just look up the top designers, agencies, and models on the internet.;
, You should have a good body, eat nutritious low-fat foods and work out regularly. Drink 8 glasses of water a day, take your vitamins, and eat healthy things like vegetables--avoid fattening junk food. Pilates or yoga is a good exercise program for getting that lean, toned physique. Go to the doctor for regular checkups. Also, take good care of your hair, skin, and nails, and keep them natural. Agencies do not like to see blemishes, lots of makeup, a ratty mane of hair, or gaudy fake nails. Do not try to make yourself anorexic just to please the agencies.
 An agency's job is to get work for models. Some models are freelancers, but most successful ones are not. Be prepared to face a lot of rejection and to keep trying through it. Remember, success does not come to those who give up after the first try, and it only takes one good agent to start a great career. So be determined, polite, professional, and smart.
 You won't get the greatest jobs at first because you're a newcomer, but if you do those jobs well, you will develop a reputation as someone who is good to work with. Also, make sure you are unique and interesting.Fashion is fickle, and the industry is always looking for the next new star, so be that star. Always do any job you get perfectly-if you are in a runway show, wow the crowd and 'sell' your look.If you get a print job, make sure your photographs are stunning.Be professional, organized, on time and pleasant to be around. Never behave like a diva or a spoiled brat-no one will want to hire you!Above all, be yourself, work hard, and have high standards for yourself.
 What do you want to be known for? Be that person at all times.

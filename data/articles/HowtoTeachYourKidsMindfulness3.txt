 To develop their breathing, have your child lay on their back with their favorite stuffed toy on their stomachs. Have your child focus on the rise and fall of the stuffed animal as they breathe. Ask your children to concentrate on their breathing and the sensation of gently raising and lowering their animal., While you guide your children through a meditation or relaxation exercise, have them visualize a rainbow or a bright light coming out of their bodies with every breath. Ask them to concentrate on their breathing while they focus on this image of themselves.

 If you are left handed, reverse the handedness of the instructions.;
, Put the string under the axle (the metal bit).
 Then roll it over to the left or just back and forth, and lift the sticks into the air when it reaches the foot. This gives the diabolo initial rotational momentum that stabilizes it when you lift it into the air.
 Try to imagine cutting a carrot with a kitchen knife. Try to keep this up as long as possible without the diabolo falling off.
 Do not fret; this is easily controlled. If the diabolo is tilting towards you, move your right hand forward. If it is tilting away from you, move your right hand back. Do this while continuing to move the right stick up and down. This works by pushing against the top of the diabolo with the string.
 Until then, you can rectify the balance of the diabolo by moving the right stick it the opposite direction diabolo is leaning. For example, if it's leaning forward, bring the stick backwards.
 This is done by simply pulling the two hand sticks apart rapidly, causing the diabolo to fly up. To catch, simply position the string underneath the axle of the diabolo.

 Lots of magazines hold photography contests, or ask your friends if they know of any. Try to choose a contest that suits you and your surroundings. For example, if the theme of the contest is "Ocean Life", and you live nowhere near an ocean or aquarium, don't decide to enter it.;
, Are you allowed to use a digital camera? Is there an age limit? How many times can you enter? Photocopy or write out a copy of the rules to carry with you when you are taking photos.
 Make sure you have enough film or digital disks and extra camera and flash batteries. If you're planning on using a special lens or tripod, make sure you know where it is.

 Making this variation is easy — since vanilla and chocolate go together, you don't even have to leave the vanilla flavorings out (although you can if you want to). Simply pour chocolate syrup into the mixture along with the other liquid ingredients. For a blended frappuccino, add ice and blend as normal — otherwise, just mix and drink.


For a subtler chocolate taste, try adding cocoa powder instead.
 If you prefer your chocolate flavor in the form of tiny chocolate chips flecked throughout your drink, just add chocolate chips or small chunks of your preferred chocolate bar. Blend the drink as normal and enjoy. For even more chocolate flavor, pair this with the chocolate frappuccino recipe above.
 Replacing the vanilla extract in either recipe with mint extract gives you a deliciously refreshing mint drink, making it perfect for hot summer days. This variation goes well with blended chocolate chips — a little green food coloring will get you that delicious "mint chocolate chip" look.


Try adding to the presentation by garnishing with fresh mint leaves. You're sure to get compliments if you're entertaining guests.
 If you don't have the ice for a blended frappuccino (or your blender can't handle it), don't worry. You can get something that's very similar to a "regular" frappuccino by adding a few scoops of vanilla ice cream instead. The drink will be a little thicker, smoother, and richer, but the flavor is fairly similar. Some "imitation" recipes even deliberately call for vanilla ice cream instead of ice.

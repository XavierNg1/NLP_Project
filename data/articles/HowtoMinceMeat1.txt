 Choose shoulder or flank meat for minced beef, pork, or lamb. Stick with dark meat for chicken and turkey. These cuts are cheaper and have the right amount of fat for proper mince. Better cuts of meat like rib eye or chops are not usually ground up.If you are not sure exactly what to buy, ask the butcher or a person at the meat counter of your local grocery store.;
, When you get the meat home, check it over for any tendons, connective tissue, or cartilage that may still be on it. Use a sharp knife to cut off these portions and throw them away. When you grind up the meat, these tissues will be noticeable in the mince if you don’t remove them.
 Proper minced meat contains fat, so be sure not to cut all of it off while you are cutting the other parts. It’s okay to cut some of the fat if you are aiming for a lean minced meat, but it will mince and cook better if you leave some of the fat on it.

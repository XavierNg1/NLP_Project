Open up the pattern window.
Left-click on the grid menu (Button with a small 3x3 grid icon, next to the word 'Playlist').
Click on 'Line', then 'Beat'.
This step allows the user to place bars of music anywhere on the pattern grid beat-by-beat, rather than being confined to a predetermined bar-by-bar grid. From this point on, simply ignore the bar count along the top of the pattern and piano roll windows; or just use them for general reference; They no longer refer to your varied time signatures.;
,
It is good practice to name your patterns according to their content. In the case of varied time signatures, the content of each pattern includes the number of beats in the bar. #*Right-click a pattern name to rename it.
An effective method of neatness is to name your patterns in the following format:
...For example: 4.bass.chorus.buildup, 5.drums.verse1.crescendo, 3.bgd.break1.wizz

, It is expected that each non-identical part and "sub-part" of music would have a separate pattern; therefore this should naturally apply to parts with differing time signatures.
Furthermore, each pattern should strictly use the relative instrument and part names at all times. This is good practice to avoid mixing up patterns or doubling-up on channels (see warnings, below.)

,
In simple terms this means setting the number of beats per bar. Do so prior to composition to avoid confusing pattern-length problems.


Open up the step sequencer.
In the top left corner, a small digital dial should be visible (similar to this: )
Left-click and drag upwards to set the number of beats per bar for this pattern. Remember that this should be equal to the number of beats specified in the pattern name.

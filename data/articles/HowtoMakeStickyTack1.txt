 You want one that has some glue left that's too dry to spread. If you want, you can use a brand new glue stick. Just let it sit without its cap for a few days so it can dry out and become more tacky.


Don't try this with a new glue stick that's still spreadable. The sticky tack will be too sticky, and it could glue your pictures to the wall instead of temporarily adhering them there, like sticky tack does.
To quickly dry out a glue stick, remove the glue from the plastic stick and put it in an oven-safe container. Cook it on the oven at a very low temperature for an hour or so, until it's dry enough that it doesn't feel sticky to the touch. Be careful when you're handling the hot pan and glue.;
, Place it between your palms and roll it around, smoosh it, and form it into a ball, then stretch it out. This will help it dry out a little more and create the right texture for sticky tack.









If it's not quite dry, sprinkle a little baby powder onto the glue ball and work it in. The powder will absorb the remaining moisture.
 Take a marker (preferably blue, the color of real sticky tack) and color the sticky tack. Any type of marker or ink will do. Add a few drops of color, then roll and stretch the glue ball to mix the color in. Keep adding more color and mixing it in until you're happy with the way it looks.









If you're concerned that the sticky tack could leave marks on your pictures, you don't have to add color. Just use the sticky tack as is. It'll work just as well!

, Take a pinch and stick it to the back of your pictures, posters, and other lightweight items, then press the items against the wall. When you're ready to take them down, the sticky tack will peel right off.

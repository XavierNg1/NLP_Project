 Starches offer a low-fat, simple thickening alternative for sauces that is especially suitable for beginning cooks.Starch thickeners are mostly flavorless, but they can give sauces an artificial sheen, making them less popular for stews or meat gravies.


Cornstarch is inexpensive, readily available, and best for dairy-based sauces. Do not use cornstarch if you plan on freezing a sauce for later use, however, as cornstarch creates a spongy texture in sauce upon freezing.
Combine 1 tablespoon (8 g) of cornstarch with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of cold water in a small bowl. With a whisk, blend them together until smooth.
Gradually whisk the mixture into your cooked sauce that needs thickening.
Continue stirring and cooking the sauce over medium to medium-high heat. Bring it to a boil.
Reduce the heat to low, and stir the sauce for an additional two minutes, allowing the cornstarch to completely finish cooking and thickening.
If you don’t cook your starches, they can leave an aftertaste in your sauce.
 Arrowroot is best for more acidic sauces, but avoid mixing arrowroot with dairy.However, you can use arrowroot when cooking with acidic dairy products like buttermilk. Arrowroot starch gives liquids a glossy appearance, making it especially desirable for dessert sauces or reductions.


In a small bowl, mix equal parts of the arrowroot starch with cold water, whisking thoroughly to beat out any lumps.
Add the arrowroot mixture to the already hot liquid and cook for 30 seconds at medium-high heat, stirring constantly.
Remove the sauce from the heat, and allow it to finish thickening as it stands.
 This is a good option for sauces that need to thicken just before they finished cooking.Like arrowroot starch, tapioca doesn’t need to come to a boil to thicken a sauce.

Whisk together equal parts flour and water in a small bowl.
Gradually add this mixture to your sauce, and cook for about a minute on medium-high heat.
Remove from heat, and let the sauce stand to thicken.

 Once you click on this icon, a drop-down menu will pop up, from which you can access a variety of Chrome options.


The menu icon looks like a small button with three horizontal lines stacked together. It is located in the upper right corner of the browser, below the “x.”

, Clicking on this option will cause the “Settings” page to open in a new tab.


If your current tab is a blank page, the “Settings” page will open in your current tab instead of a new one.
 This option appears under the "On startup" section of your "Settings" page.


Your other startup options include "Open the New Tab page," which will open a blank page once Chrome starts up, and "Continue where I left off," which will open the tabs that remained open at the end of your last browsing section.
 This option appears to the right of the "Open a specific page or set of pages" option.


Clicking on this link will cause a separate "Startup pages" dialog box to open.
 Type the URL in the text box to the "Add a new page" label.


The Google URL is: https://www.google.com/


, Clicking on this button closes the dialog box and saves your startup page setting.


You will be returned to the “Settings” page, but no further action is required.

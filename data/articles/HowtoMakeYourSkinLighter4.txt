 The sun can cause serious damage to the skin—from sun spots to burns and skin cancer. This is why it's important that you wear sunscreen everyday to protect your skin and keep it healthy. Even if it's cloudy, the sun's UV rays can still break through, so you need to wear sunscreen in winter too. Use an SPF of at least 30 on a daily basis.If your skin is very light, you should use a higher SPF—45 to 75 is ideal.
 Keeping your skin hydrated helps your skin stay healthy. This allows old, pigmented layers to fade away and reveal fresh, new ones underneath. Drink at least 6 to 8 glasses a day for best results.Keep a bottle of water with you to make keeping yourself hydrated a little easier.
Add lemon or another type of fruit if you don’t like the taste of water alone.
 Cleanse your face twice a day with a foaming cleanser or soap and follow with a good moisturizer. You should also use gentle skincare products formulated for your skin type. If you use products unsuitable for your skin it may cause redness. Along with a daily routine, exfoliate at least once a week to remove dead skin cells.Always take your makeup off before bed. Otherwise, the oils could clog your pores, leading to uneven skin tone or even breakouts.

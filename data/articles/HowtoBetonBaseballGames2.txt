Moneyline is the most popular form of gambling for baseball.
 Moneyline has a numerical technique that differs from basketball or football, where a team is favored by points. Favored teams are valued with a negative value and the underdog team is placed with a positive value. To profit from the the value of -130, you need to wager $130 to win $100. To profit off the underdog with a value of +165, you have to bet $100 to receive $165.


Think of 100 in between the two values, like +165 +100 -185.Youâ€™re meant to risk more for the favored team.
 Take a look at the odds board and see which team is favored and which team is the underdog. Use this information alongside your prior knowledge of the players and performance history. If you are a Cubs fan, and they are projected as the underdog, decide if you want to bet against your home team.
 Bookmakers include the starting pitcher in their published lines. The starting pitcher has the most single handed effect on the game in terms of wagering. It helps if you watch the game religiously before beginning to place bets, unless you have the means to gamble loosely.

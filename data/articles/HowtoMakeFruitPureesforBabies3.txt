 At this age, your baby will have grown her first set (or two) of teeth. She will not necessarily chew with her teeth yet, and will most likely still grind food with her gums. On top of the fruits and vegetables you are already giving her, you can also start feeding your baby small amount of (pasteurized) cheese, and little bits of protein, like eggs, tofu, meat, and fish.

Fruits that you can begin serving your child at this time include cherries, and strawberries, plus all the fruits already mentioned.
You can begin to feed your baby one-half to three-fourths of a cup of puree, twice a day.
 Fresh cherries are rich in antioxidants that can help your baby to fight off illness. Off season cherries can be bought frozen. Combine cherries with fruits like bananas, apples, and pears.

To make cherry puree, wash cherries under clean running water. Dry them in a colander. If cherries are a bit under ripe, you can steam them (skin on) for 4 minutes and then transfer to a colander to dry off excess water or just place in the bowl to steep in their own juices.
If the cherries are ripe, you can choose not to steam them. Slice the cherries along their lengths and pry them open. Remove the pit in the middle, as well as the stem. Double check that you got all of the pits. Put the pitless cherries in the food processor and puree or blitz them. You can leave some whole chunks for your baby to practice chewing with.
 Strawberries are rich in vitamins B and C. You can mix strawberries with pretty much every other fruit to create tasty combination. Avoid buying strawberries that are tinged green and white, which means the fruit is not ripe.

To make a strawberry puree, place the berries in a colander and wash with clean running water. With a paring knife, slice off the top with the green leaves. Place the berries in the processor and run it on blitz or puree. Feel free to leave some chunks of fruits in the puree.

 The directions will assume that you are using your right leg. It’s a good idea to put your dominant leg forward.
 It’s a good idea to take off your socks so that you are able to keep your balance. Consider using a yoga or exercise mat too – if you slip and fall into the split too quickly you might seriously strain a muscle or pull your hamstring., As you stretch your left leg back, put your left foot on the ground with the outer side of your foot facing down. You should begin to feel some tension in your hamstrings at this point. Don’t be afraid to put your hands on the ground so you can keep your balance and ease yourself down., As you get lower your right leg should get straighter Continue using your hands for balance, as you get lower. Breathe deeply and relax – trust your flexibility. If you’re tensed up preparing to feel pain it will be much harder to do the split.As you learn, consider putting yoga blocks to your right and left. This way you can place your hands on them and have stability much earlier.
If you feel any pain at all, stop. Continue your stretching regimen and try again in another few days.
 You right foot will slide forward and your left leg will slide back. Your weight should transfer to your heels as you start to move into a deeper split, and then the pressure will transfer to your hamstrings. If you don’t feel pain, don’t be afraid to continue lowering yourself. Remember to use your hands for balance.Go down onto the floor as low as you can. Once you reach the ground you will have completed a full split.

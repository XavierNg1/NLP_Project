 You’ve heard the adage about scratching each other’s backs. This may be even more true in the virtual world. The more you like and share other people’s posts, the more likely they are to interact with your posts as well., Joining or creating groups can help you get in touch with people that have a shared interest. In turn, you’ll have access to a targeted network of users that you know you can appeal to with certain types of posts. Furthermore, posts from other people in the group will provide you with information that you can feature or comment on in your own posts., Posts that educate people can get a lot of likes and shares. This is especially true when you share something that may be immediately pertinent to your friends' lives. For instance, make a post about a new app you’ve been using, and briefly mention how it’s made your life easier., Comments on recent or current events should be as fresh as possible. It will boost your popularity if you’re ahead of the curve regarding developments that people in your friend network are interested in. Further, get in the habit of offering your brief perspective on things when posting media items - and address specifically what you like or don’t like about something you’re posting., Posting too frequently can actually decrease your popularity on Facebook, as people may unfollow you (even if they stay friends with you), and never see your posts at all. Limit yourself to two daily posts as a general maximum. Once a day is probably better, especially if you time the post well.

 Follow news sources as well as associations and organizations you belong to, such as the National Education Association (NEA).


Stay organized by setting up lists in your Twitter account. This will help you quickly access information you might need from a major news source like CNN, a local newspaper or a statewide government office.;
, Educators and administrators often tweet ideas, thoughts on curricula and advice on teaching. You can learn about what works for your peers and get fresh ideas when you feel stuck.


Remember to participate in the dialogue. Respond to tweets that are especially helpful to you, or ask questions. You can also use the direct message feature to get in touch with a person or organization you are following and would like to speak with in more detail.
 Hashtags are words or phrases that start with the number sign: #. These organize topics for you. For example, relevant hashtags for teachers might be #teach, #education, #edreform and #teachchat.

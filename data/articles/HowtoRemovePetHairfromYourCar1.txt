 You can either use 100% water or create a solution that consists of equal parts fabric softener and water.The ingredients used in fabric softener help to loosen hair and will make it easier to clean the pet hair from your car.;
, Once you have created the solution, you need to wet the upholstery or carpeting in your car. You can do this by wearing a pair of rubber gloves and dipping the fingertips into the solution, or by filling a small spray bottle with the solution and spritzing the desired area., While wearing a rubber glove, brush your hand along the desired area. The hair should collect on your glove. Every so often dip your gloved hand into the solution to remove the hair and keep your finger tips wet.


Alternatively, you could scrub the area with a pumice stone to collect the hair.
 Vacuum over the area once it has dried in order to collect any excess hair. For the best results, use a vacuum attachment that has small rubber bristles., You can also blow up a balloon and rub it across the desired area. The balloon will create static electricity and as a result, the pet hair will stick to the balloon. Once the balloon is covered with hair, use your hand to collect the hair and throw it in the garbage.

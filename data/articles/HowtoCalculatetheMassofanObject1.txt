 Make sure the pan you will place your object onto is clean and dry.;
, Move all the weights to the zero position, then turn the knob on the far left beneath the scale pan. The scales should move around. Continue turning it in either direction until the white "pointer" line on the right of the beams lines up with the "0" marking on the right-hand side.
 Be careful not to influence the weight of the object with your hand or other objects.
 Slide the weights left and right on the beams until the two white lines at the right line up again. The most efficient way to do this is to make a rough estimate as to what you think the mass will be, and then move the highest value weight you think will still be lower than the mass. Move this weight until the pointer is just under 0. Then move on progressively to the next smallest weights to get closer and closer to the actual mass.
 Add the measurement of each weight together. The total will be the mass of the object.

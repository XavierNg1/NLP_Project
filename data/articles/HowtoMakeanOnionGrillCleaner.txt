 You will need the entire half of the onion to clean the grill. If the grill is especially dirty, save the other onion half in the event you need to continue cleaning after you’ve used the first onion.;
, Make sure you use actual grill equipment as you will need some length and strength behind you.
 This part is important as cleaning it won’t work if the grill is cold. The hot grill combined with the onion juices will loosen and lift any baked on grime.


Rub onion over the grates several times until you see residual food/grime lift from the grates.
Push food/residue off to one side of the grill or, if possible, off the entire grill and onto the floor.
 Take extra care to protect your hands while doing so, so be sure you don’t make direct contact with the grill.

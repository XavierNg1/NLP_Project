 In a medium-sized bowl, mix together ½ cup (45 g) of rolled oats, ¼ cup (59 ml) fresh lemon juice, ¼ cup (59 ml) water, and ½ tablespoon (11 g) of honey. Use a spoon to stir the mixture until all of the ingredients are well combined.To avoid possibly adding chemicals to your face wash, it’s best to use filtered water.
You can use any type of honey that you like, but an organic variety is usually best.
Store the face wash in an airtight jar or container.;
, Once all of the ingredients are combined, use your fingers to apply the wash to your face. Gently massage it into the skin in a circular motion for approximately 30 seconds to help cleanse and remove dead skin cells.Be careful not to massage or scrub at your skin too roughly to avoid irritation and redness.
 After you’ve massaged the face wash into your skin, remove it with lukewarm water. If you’re having difficulty rinsing it, use a clean washcloth that’s dampened with lukewarm water to help it away.For best results, splash your face with cold water after rinsing off the face wash. It will help remove any lingering oil on the surface of your skin.

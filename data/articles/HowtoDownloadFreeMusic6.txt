 There are a couple of websites that allow you to enter a YouTube video link into an input field and “rip” the audio track from it for download, usually as a medium-quality (128 Kbps) mp3 file.


Converting YouTube videos violates the site’s Terms of Service. Downloading too often may cause YouTube to ban your IP from accessing any further YouTube content.
 Select your browser's address bar and copy the entire web address (URL) of the video.
 The conversion process may take several minutes, depending on the length of the video file.
 Once the file is ready, it'll appear above the text field. Click the “Download” link to save it to your computer.
 Open it on your computer and make sure there aren't any flaws in it. This was more of an issue with converted mp3s a few years ago than it is today, but it's still prudent to check.

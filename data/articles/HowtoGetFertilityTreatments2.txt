 The doctor may recommend both partners be tested depending on each personâ€™s medical history. A medical history evaluation can also help the doctor prioritize tests based on the most likely cause of infertility.


Men may undergo a general physical examination as well as an ultrasound examination to ensure the sexual organs are functioning correctly. A doctor will likely order a semen analysis which will determine the number and quality of sperm. A blood test to evaluate hormone levels may also be recommended.
Like men, women may also undergo physical and ultrasound examinations and hormone testing, as well as other testing that is specific to female reproduction. A hysterosalpingography is a test in which the doctor injects fluid into the uterus and then uses an X-ray to determine if the fluid proceeds to the fallopian tubes without encountering a blockage. A doctor may recommend a laparoscopy, which is typically an outpatient procedure performed under general anesthesia. A laparoscopy allows the doctor to see the uterus and fallopian tubes with a tiny fiber-optic telescope. Genetic testing may also give some insight into what is causing the infertility.

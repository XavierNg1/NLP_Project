 The Microsoft website offers a variety of Language Packs that you can install without having to reinstall Windows. You'll need to have Service Pack 3 installed in order to use these language packs.



Click here and look for your language in the list. If the language you want is listed, and you are currently using the required base language, click the "Get it now" link to download the pack. If your desired language is not listed, or you aren't using the right base language, see the next step.
Run the downloaded installer and follow the prompts to install the pack. Once the installation is complete, you'll see your changes take effect after restarting.;
, While it is not technically possible to change the base language without reinstalling Windows, you can use a workaround to change the majority of the interface to your desired language. This requires downloading the Service Pack 3 update (even if you already have it installed) as well as changing a few registry values.
 Visit the Service Pack 3 download page here. Use the drop-down menu to select the language that you want to change to. Once you've selected the language, click the "Download" button and then select the second option in the window that appears. Ignore the additional options and click the blue button in the lower-right corner to download the file.


Do not start installing the SP3 update yet. It won't work until you've changed the registry.
 To change your language, you'll need to make a small change to your system registry. The registry is what controls Windows, so be careful when making changes here.


To open the Registry Editor, press ⊞ Win+R, type regedit, and press ↵ Enter.
 you can expand the folders to see subfolders. Selecting a folder will display any keys it contains in the right frame.


Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/ControlSet001/Control/NIs/Language.
 This should be at the top of the list. A new window will appear, allowing you to change the value.
 Each language has a four-digit code that you'll need to enter into the "Value data" field. Refer to the list below to find the language you want to change to and enter the proper code. Make sure that it is the same language you selected for the SP3 file.Language Codes

, This can usually be found at the bottom of the list of keys. Use the same code that you used for the "(Default)" key.
 You must restart before you proceed, or the Service Pack 3 installation will not work.
 Once you have rebooted your computer, run the Service Pack 3 installation. It doesn't matter if you already have Service Pack 3 installed, as the installer will just overwrite the system files with the new ones in the correct language. Follow the prompts to install the Service Pack.
 After the installation is complete, you'll need to reboot your computer for the changes to take effect. Once the computer has rebooted, you should be able to see the changes to your display language.


You may notice that some elements are still in the original language. This is a limitation of the workaround. The only way to completely display a different language is to reinstall Windows XP and select the correct language during installation.

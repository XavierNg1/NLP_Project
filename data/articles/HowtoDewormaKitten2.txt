 Kittens who have worms will have large, round, swollen tummies. This is different from the kittens gaining weight. The tummy will not match the rest of the body because the cat will not be gaining weight, despite an increase in appetite.The kitten may even lose weight.
 Kittens with worms will not grow at the normal rate. They will appear smaller and not gain the right amount of weight each week. Instead, they will be smaller and unhealthy looking.Healthy kittens will gain weight as they grow. For example, by two weeks, they should be between eight to 14 ounces, and by four weeks they should be 12 ounces to 1.3 pounds. Healthy kittens will gain around 1.75 to 3.5 ounces each week.This occurs because the worms are taking the nutrients that the kitten needs.
 Worms cause problems with a kittenâ€™s digestive system. Worms may cause the kitten to lose their appetite or vomit. They also may have diarrhea, and sometimes it may be bloody.Often, you will find worms in the vomit or feces, and you may even see worms around the anal area.
 The best way to prevent your kitten from getting infected with worms is to keep them indoors. Outdoor cats come into contact with all sorts of things that may transfer worms to them, such as contaminated feces, food, or animals.This also helps protect them from ticks, fleas, and other parasites.

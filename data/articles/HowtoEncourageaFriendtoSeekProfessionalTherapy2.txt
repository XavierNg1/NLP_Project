 Walking into a conversation and saying, “You’re depressed and need help” is going to make anyone defensive. Instead, put the focus on yourself and how you’re feeling. The person may not get combative with you if you make the topic more about you.


For example, you could say, “I’m really concerned that you may be struggling with depression. I’ve noticed certain behaviors in you and I think it would be helpful if you could talk to a professional. Could you do that for me?”, No one wants to hear there is something wrong with them. It can become particularly hurtful when negative words are used to describe them. Never use a label when talking to your friend; doing so can make them reject everything you are trying to say.


For instance, never say the person is “crazy” or a “lunatic.” They might even say something like, “You think I’m crazy,” and it is important to let them know that you absolutely do not think that. Similarly, don’t call your friend a “drunk” or a “druggie.” Instead, you could say they haven’t been acting like themselves, or you feel like they’ve been indulging in alcohol or drugs excessively., The point of the meeting is to encourage your friend to get help. If you let them know you will be with them every step of the way, they are more likely to seek treatment and try to get better. Thinking that they will have to deal with this alone may make them more afraid and reluctant to seek help.


Be sure to let your friend know that you are not trying to take over their pursuit of treatment, but that you are trying to help make it easier for them to get treatment. Ask what you can do to help.
One way to show your support is to lead by example. If you want your friend to stop drinking, then stop drinking yourself. Using the “Do as I say, not as I do” approach won’t work here. By bettering yourself, you may encourage them to get the help they need, too.

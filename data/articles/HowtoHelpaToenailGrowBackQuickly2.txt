 This can help moisturize the skin so that the area heals more quickly. Dip a cotton swab in the oil, then dab it against the part of your toenail that has grown out. Alternately, fill a small bowl with olive/coconut/flaxseed oil, then soak your toe in the oil for 10-15 minutes. Be aware that this latter method may not use the oil as efficiently.


Wear open-toed shoes (or no shoes) for an hour after application, or until the oil has soaked into the skin. The effect will be stronger if you give your skin time to absorb the moisture.
 First, fill a large bowl with warm (comfortable, not hot) water. Add 1-3 green tea bags, and let the tea steep for at least five minutes. Place the bowl on the floor in front of a comfortable chair within reach of your feet. Sit in the chair, make yourself comfortable, and then place your feet in the bowl. Sit for about fifteen minutes—or until the water cools down—before taking your feet out.


Consider keeping a towel nearby to dry your feet afterward.
Repeat every 2-3 days while your nail is growing back. The green tea should soothe your skin and stimulate your nail growth.
 Soak your nails in fresh orange juice for 10 minutes each day. Afterward, rinse your nails off with warm water, pat dry, and apply moisturizer. Repeat this process once a day until your nail has grown back.
 Hair and nails may grow much more quickly when you take biotin as a dietary supplement. Indeed, weak and slow-growing nails are often linked to a biotin deficiency. You can also increase your daily biotin levels by eating gelatin, which is a natural source.


Beware: gelatin and supplements containing gelatin are known to increase urine oxalates, which might increase the risk of kidney stones in some people.

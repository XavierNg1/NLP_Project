 Drop a pinch of salt to the bottom of a 5 ounce or larger glass bottle. Next, add 3 drops of lavender essential oil and 3 drops of frankincense essential oil. The salt will help disperse the essential oils throughout the toner.If you don’t have lavender or frankincense essential oils, you can use 6 drops of your favorite essential oils instead. Just make sure that they aren’t oils that irritate your skin.
 With the salt and essential oils in the glass bottle, pour in 3 ounces (90 ml) of witch hazel and 1 ounce (30 ml) of rose water. Shake the bottle gently to mix all of the ingredients until they are thoroughly combined.The toner doesn’t need to be stored in the refrigerator, but it can be very refreshing to chill it during warmer months.
 If you have sensitive skin, you have to be careful about applying new products to it. To make sure that the toner will work for your skin, test a small amount of it on a small patch of skin, such as behind your ear or along your jaw. Wait 24 to 48 hours to see if you have a reaction. If you don’t, you can use the toner freely., After you’ve washed your face with your normal face wash, wet a cotton pad or ball with the toner. Gently run the cotton all over your face to apply the toner. Follow up with the rest of your usual skincare routine.If you prefer, you can store the toner in a spray bottle and spray on it on your face instead of using the cotton pads or balls.

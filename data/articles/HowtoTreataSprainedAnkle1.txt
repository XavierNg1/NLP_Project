 Skip any activities that cause pain or limping.


If you have a severe sprain, then you should walk with crutches or a cane so that you don't cause further injury.
Vary your exercise routine. If you're used to running on a treadmill, try swimming or using a rowing machine instead. Just make sure that you don't completely avoid physical activity. You still need to keep your other muscles conditioned.;

Apply ice to your ankle even if you plan to go to the doctor. Ice will keep your ligaments from becoming inflamed and will stop any bleeding if you've torn a ligament.
Place a plastic bag with ice on your ankle for 15 to 20 minutes. Do this 3 to 5 times daily for the first 3 days. Alternatively, you can fill a bucket with ice water and immerse your foot and ankle.
Leave the ice off at least 30 minutes between applications. The latest recommendation from athletic trainers is to apply ice for the first 48 to 72 hours.
If your foot or ankle looks white, remove the ice immediately so that you don't develop a cold injury.
If you have diabetes or inhibited circulation, make sure that you talk to your doctor before applying ice.



Wrap an elastic bandage from your toes to your mid-calf, using even pressure. Keep the bandage on until the swelling subsides.
Loosen the wraps if your toes turn blue, feel cold or begin to feel numb. You don't want the wrap to be too loose, but you don't want it to be too tight, either.
 Elevation will help to drain fluid from the injury.

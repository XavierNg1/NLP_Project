 Empathy is considered a thinking response and an emotional response. This means that when you empathize with someone, you are demonstrating your ability to experience another person’s feelings in a certain circumstance. You also experience a negative response to someone’s difficult circumstances and their negative emotions. So, empathy requires to exercise your ability to process someone else’s circumstances and your ability to experience someone else’s circumstances.In the human world, empathy is seen as a way to demonstrate social competence. It is also a highly valued skill in people who are perceived as leaders and role models. When you are empathetic, you also display your ability to be self-aware of your responses and reactions. This can help you to better process your own emotional thoughts and feelings.
 While there is still debate around the presence of empathy in all animals, many researchers argue that empathy in humans operates differently than empathy in animals. Humans make moral judgements based on empathy that differs from the way animals make judgements, which is often based on the strength of survival and a “you scratch my back, I’ll scratch your back” mentality. We also use our empathy differently than animals, as we are conditioned by social codes to react to others. This means that animals and humans may not view empathy in the same way or use it in the same way.
 It is important to remember that studies on empathy in animals are ongoing and there are no definitive studies on the topic. If you observe an animal and interact with an animal but do not note any signs or empathy, this may not mean the animal does not have the capacity for empathy. This may just mean their empathy is not being triggered properly or they may be processing the situation differently than you might think they would.

 A person's "carbon footprint" is the amount of carbon he or she is responsible for releasing into the atmosphere as a result of his or her daily habits. The more fossil fuels you're responsible for burning, the bigger your footprint. For example, someone who bikes to work might have a smaller footprint than someone who drives each day.


To find out how big your footprint is, use a free carbon footprint calculator.Your driving habits, spending habits, diet, and a number of other factors are taken into account to calculate how much carbon you're responsible for releasing into the atmosphere.;
, Since you're concerned about reducing your greenhouse gas emissions, you'll want to find ways to shrink your footprint until it's as small as possible. Reflect on the areas that could use some improvement and strive to make long-term changes. Even small lifestyle changes can make a big difference.


For example, eating meat every day can lead to a larger carbon footprint, since the process of getting meat from the pasture to your table requires a lot of energy and fuel.Participating in Meatless Mondays or going meat-free for awhile will reduce your footprint.
 Individuals like you who want to pitch in to cut back on greenhouse gas emissions can make a big impact, but in order for global warming to cease to be a threat, it's important to speak up to make sure corporations get on board with curbing emissions, too. Research shows that just 90 companies are responsible for two-thirds of greenhouse gas emissions.Look for ways you can help beyond changing your personal habits.


For example, you could write a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) telling them to limit carbon pollution from existing power plants.Next time you vote in an election, choose the candidate who's most committed to limiting your town's emissions and stopping global warming.

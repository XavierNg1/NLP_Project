 When bad things happen to you, try to remember that things could be worse. This is not to diminish the pain of the things going on in your life: no, those things still suck. There’s no changing that. But when you understand that things could be worse, you’ll find it much easier to appreciate the things that you do have.
 So, knowing that you could lose so much more but that you haven’t, take the time to appreciate the things in your life that make you happy. Hug your mom, tell your best friend how much they mean to you, and watch a sunset...because right now, in this moment, you’re alive and that (in itself) is amazing and wonderful.


If it feels like you don’t have things in your life to appreciate or being happy about, then you need to go out and get some things to be happy about. Start volunteering, make a new friend, or do something you’ve always wanted to do. Our lives are short and we shouldn’t spend them being bored and unhappy.
 Things will go wrong. It happens. It happens a lot, actually. But if you believe and understand that things go wrong, then you will know that things going wrong doesn’t make the world end. Our problems will sometimes seem big, and they often are incredibly painful and difficult to handle, but (as the proverb goes) this too shall pass. You will have other problems and you will have other happiness.
 You can’t change the past, you can’t undo something that’s gone wrong. All you can do is pick yourself up and move on. Take a new approach and fix the problem if you can. If you can’t, just go on to the next thing. Giving yourself a new goal, a new purpose, and new successes will help you not care about the failures you have experienced.

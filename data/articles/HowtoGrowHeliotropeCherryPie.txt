 Visit your nursery or garden center for a seedling. Or, take a cutting from a friend's or neighbor's plant.


If propagating, take stem (softwood) cuttings during the summer.
Heliotrope can also be grown from seed. Purchase from specialist nursery suppliers, or check online.;
, If planting in the garden or as a border plant, choose a spot that gets lots of bright light. However, avoid anywhere with too much heat. During winter, heliotrope needs cool temperatures.


Heliotrope will tolerate sun to partial shade.
Alternatively, choose a container for the plant. This is ideal if you live with snowed-in winters, as heliotrope usually won't survive the very cold temperatures.
Heliotrope grows well in window boxes; the scent will drift in through your open window.
 The soil needs to retain moisture constantly without being water logged.


Heliotrope can tolerate soils that range from mildly acidic to mildly alkaline.
 The plant needs plentiful water during the warmer months when it's growing and blooming––do not let it dry out between waterings. Water sparingly during winter.
 Apply an all-purpose fertilizer in spring if growing in a garden bed. If grown in a container, apply a liquid feed monthly during spring and summer.
 Heliotrope can become a little scraggly if left to its own devices. Prune the plant in spring to remove dead flower heads and to keep the plant compact.

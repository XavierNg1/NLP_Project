 Perfume scent is stimulated by warm skin. The best areas are the neck, cleavage, areas where the veins are closest to the skin's surface such as the pulse of the hand and neck, the upper fold of the elbow, the back of the knee or behind the ear. Freshly washed hair will carry a scent for up to a week.


Since aromatic essences are highly volatile, they tend to rise in the air, therefore, a great trick is spraying perfume around the waist.;
, For example: Wash with scented shower gel, use scented deodorant, apply the perfume extract base, and 30 minutes after the first application of perfume, add water to strengthen and extend the effect of the scent's duration.


Buy a neutral-smelling body lotion and add 3-4 drops of your favorite flavor. This provides another form of care for the application layers.
 We know that we tend to easily get used to the scent, so, we can sometimes put on too much just to be able to smell it and this is overwhelming for others.
 To get the best out of scent or perfume it is recommended to keep the nozzle 6 inches (15.2Â cm) away from the skin(where you want to apply it) and then spray.

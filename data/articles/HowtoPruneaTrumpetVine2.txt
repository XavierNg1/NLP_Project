 Pluck the out buds developing at the tip of the vine branches. By removing buds from the tip of the branch, you redirect the vine's energy, sending it outward rather than upward. As a result, you will have a fuller vine rather than a thin, scraggly one.
 As flowers begin to die or look ragged, pick them out instead of letting them drop. Generally, plucking out the flowers before they have the chance to come to seed and die will encourage floral growth to last longer into the season.

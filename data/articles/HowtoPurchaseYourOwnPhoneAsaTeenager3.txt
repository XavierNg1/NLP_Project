 This way, you have the chance to show your responsibility and hard work. Show the information you've collected over the previous period of time and get them thinking. Mention the money you've been collecting, and show them your container for proof.


Don't sneak around your parents' back and buy a phone - there's no way they won't notice!

, Use a program such as PowerPoint to collect your work, information, and research in a nice slideshow. If you can, make graphs, or compare the phone you want to others (more and less popular phones, your parents' phones, etc).
 Collect your parents at a good time for them (not when angry, not right after coming home, etc) and go through the slideshow. Mention why things would be good for you, pros and cons, and so on. Show your savings and present the type of phone and data plan you would like.


If your parents are mad or busy, don't pull them away for the presentation!

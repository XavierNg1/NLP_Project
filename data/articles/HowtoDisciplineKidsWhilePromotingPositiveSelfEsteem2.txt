 The goal of discipline is not to express your anger or frustration at your kids, but to help them learn from their mistakes. When you are disciplining your kids, be gentle yet firm. If you’re having a hard time controlling your anger, take a moment to gather yourself or take some deep breaths. Then, approach your kid in a calm manner.Be both kind and firm. Don’t budge, especially if your kid wants an exception or thinks you’re being unfair.
Say, “You know the rules not to run in the house. When you run in the house, you get a timeout.”

, Part of effective discipline means being consistent. Your child should know that if they behave a certain way, they will receive discipline. Don’t let some things slide while punishing others. If your child is misbehaving, be consistent to similar behavioral situations and events. This can help you get along with your child better.For example, if your child is kicking, hitting, or punching another child, respond the same way to these actions. Be consistent so they know that they will be disciplined following these actions.
When your child breaks a rule, keep the discipline in line with the severity of the infraction.
Make sure that you and your spouse are on the same page regarding discipline. Talk over your expectations together and decide on rules.
 Focus your efforts on developing their character. Teach them through discipline to respect other’s thoughts, opinions, and personal space. Focus on them learning how to cooperate, contribute, and be kind to others. When disciplining your child, make sure to tell them that it’s important to treat others with respect, care, and consideration.For example, if your child is mean to another child, have them apologize to the child and give them a hug. Tell your child the importance of being kind to others.

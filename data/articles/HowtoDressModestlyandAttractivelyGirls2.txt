 A fitted tank top with a high crew neckline can look lovely when paired with a cardigan sweater or fitted denim jacket. Add style to your look by choosing one with a fun print or embellishments at the collar.
 If you fall in love with a top or dress that has a deep v-neck or low square neckline, do not despair. A plain camisole or one with feminine lace detailing at the neck can transform that garment into something that will work with your modest wardrobe. Many camisoles have adjustable straps, so you can extend the neckline of the camisole to cover up any cleavage or uncomfortable amounts of skin.
 Think shawls, denim jackets, leather jackets, cardigan sweaters, blazers, military-style jackets, and more. The more variety you have in your outerwear, the more looks you can create. Outerwear is great for layering over pieces with low-cut backs or skinny straps.
 If you want to wear a dress or skirt, but worry that the hemline might be a bit too short, compensate by wearing something beneath it. Skinny jeans and leggings work well for many pieces. Be aware that many leggings may still look immodest, however, since they have a tendency to sculpt your body. To avoid this, only wear leggings with a skirt that covers your rear and most of your thighs. Do not wear super-short mini skirts that reveal everything the moment you sit down.

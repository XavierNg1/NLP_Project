 It would be best to get a barber to do this initially, however, if you feel confident enough you can do this yourself if you have a set of hair clippers at home.;
, Make sure that you have a good quality razor (ie: Gillette Mach III or similar) with a clean, sharp blade. Decent shave gel or foam. A hand-held mirror (this helps you to see the back of your head when shaving). A clean towel. After-shave balm or moisturiser.
 Let the water absorb a little on the scalp.
 Leave the foam on my head for a minute or so before shaving. I find that this helps quite a bit when it comes to the shave.
 Do not press too hard on the blade, but allow the razor to "glide" on your scalp. If you really want to, you can do a second shave in the opposite direction, called "against the grain", which produces a much smoother result, but remember to re-apply shave gel or foam.
 This action helps open up the pores in your scalp & also helps to soothe the skin after the shave.
 This soothes & protects the scalp.
, You will love the whole experience, guaranteed.

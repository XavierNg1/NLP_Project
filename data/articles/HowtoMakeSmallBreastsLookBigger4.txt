 Small breasts aren't the burden they may seem to you. For starters, not everyone loves large breasts. Indeed, it's an exaggeration that men only like women with large breasts––everyone has their own preference. Moreover, small breasts tend to hold up best over time, and gravity tends to be lot kinder to the small-breasted woman as you age; you'll sag a lot less than your big-breasted sister. As long as you are healthy, try to be happy with your body.
 It may seem like it will never happen, but it just might!


There is many a teen girl who at 16 thinks her breasts will always be small, but finds out at 20 they are not. It just happens.
You may find your breasts get larger and stay that way after pregnancy and breast feeding. It tends to be all over the map, some report breast sizes increase, some decrease, some decrease and then increase.

 To log into Gmail and Yahoo Mail, head to your preferred browser (for both Mac and PC) and enter the following address:


For Gmail: www.mail.google.com
For Yahoo Mail: www.mail.yahoo.com
For Outlook (applicable only for Windows), simply double-click the Outlook icon on your desktop. If it isn't there, click the Start menu in the lower left of the screen. In the search bar, type in Outlook, and the software should appear in the results. Click on Outlook to launch it. Assuming you've configured your e-mail with Outlook, it should log right into your e-mail account.;
, To view an attachment on Outlook, Gmail, and Yahoo, click the Inbox in the left panel. It should take you to the list of e-mails you've received. #*Look for an e-mail message with a paperclip icon on it. This means that the message contains an attachment.
 It should show you the contents of the message as well as display the attachment on the bottom of the message.



When the message is opened in Yahoo, the contents are displayed. Just click on the attachment and the browser should open it if it's an HTML file like a web page. If it's a file that requires a different program, it will download the file and launch it with the appropriate program. If it's a file that can be viewed through the email client like a text or document file, you can view it without downloading by clicking the attachment name and selecting View when a dialogue box pops up.
Gmail works similarly to Yahoo, but you click the Options menu in the right of the attachment name. Click "Preview" on the top of the Options menu, which pops up after clicking the options icon (looks like 3 dots stacked on each other).
In Outlook, you can right-click the attachment and choose View attachment to see it without downloading it.

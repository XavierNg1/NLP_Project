 Decide upon daily, weekly and monthly cleaning. For example:


Make your bed daily.






Do your laundry weekly.






Clean your closet monthly.








Whatever you choose for the schedule, be sure to stick to it. Otherwise, there is a risk that the cleaning work will be tougher when you do get around to it.;
, If there isn't enough room for everything, consider storing the things that you do not use in the attic or basement. Obtain some shipping boxes and label them.







Place your shoes near the door. You'll be able to find them more easily when you need to get ready to go somewhere.






Place your books and study materials in a specific area.






Place magazines on a table or a shelf near your bed for easy access. This way, you'll know where to find them anytime you need them.






Store extra shoes in a tray under your bed. Just pull the tray out when you need a new pair.

Store keepsakes, mementos and other miscellaneous items in a shoe box. This prevents clutter, and you can save tons of space.






Store video games and toys in shipping boxes.






Store a collection of small toys in a ziploc bag before placing it in a box. Just pull out the bag when you want to play with them.






Organize your books on the top shelf of the closet.
 Things can easily spill and then you would have to clean up the spill. In addition, insects like ants would come. Prevent this by having your food and drinks in the kitchen or in the living room. If you have to bring drinks, use a bottle and a coaster.

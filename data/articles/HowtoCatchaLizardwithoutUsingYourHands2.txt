 Bad smells can keep the lizards away you’re your trap. Using cellophane, thoroughly cover the open end and secure it around the sides with odor-free tape.
 Make sure it’s in the middle of the cellophane covering and be certain that it isn’t much bigger than your lizards will be. If it’s too big other critters you don’t want in there with the lizards could get in (e.g. bigger snakes).You can also use a glass pet terrarium if you have one and don’t mind cutting a hole in the screen top. This will also give you a 360-degree view of the inside of the box from a distance.
 This will tell you what your lizard likes to eat. Drop a few bugs from the pet shop inside.Choose food carefully. For example, the western long tail lizards near Las Vegas feed on insects and spiders. You may not find the right type of spiders in the pet shop so relocating a spider from around the house to your trap could work. You could also try putting some fruit inside to attract flies and fruit flies that will also be enticing.
 If there is a ledge nearby, use it to your advantage. Lizards love the climb walls so this could be an extra-attractive location.
 If there’s moisture on the ground, this will help keep it dry.
 If not, make sure you still have live bait inside. If you have…enjoy!

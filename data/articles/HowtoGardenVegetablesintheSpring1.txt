 It’s usually a good idea to wait until all danger of frost has passed to sow your vegetables. Later sowings usually catch up with earlier sowings, so waiting to plant will most likely not hurt your harvest. Warmer months also soften up the ground, making it easier to work the soil and sow your vegetables.


Some crops, like carrots or peas, can be sown before the last frosts.;
, You can also start sowing your seeds indoors by placing a pot on a window ledge or in a greenhouse. Indoor temperatures provide a milder climate for young seedlings.


However, seedlings that are grown indoors will need to be “hardened off” (gradually adjusted to outdoor climates) rather than just being moved outdoors when the weather is nice.
 If you are sowing indoors, you can still prepare the outdoor beds in the early spring. To do this:


Weed the area and incorporate plenty of well-rotted manure into the soil.
Improve drainage if the area is soggy by incorporating some grit into the soil or raising the beds.
If you plan to plant perennial vegetables, you might incorporate a slow release feed such as bonemeal.
 Slugs and snails can present a serious threat to your seedlings and young plants. There are various methods you can use to protect your plants from these pests, including:


Laying pellets, setting traps, or surrounding your plants with barriers such as copper tape.
You can also check your plants for snails and slugs each day and remove these pests from your plants when you find them.
 Some plants will not produce their first year but will be ready to produce the next spring. If this is the case with your plants, protect them from the cold of winter by covering them in a thick layer of mulch. Brush the mulch aside in the early spring.


Plants that may not produce their first year include cabbage and asparagus.

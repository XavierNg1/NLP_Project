 It's found on the beaches of Route 8, Poni Breaker Coast, and Poni Wilds. Depending on where you go to find it, it'll be between level 17 and level 43.;
, It'll be found in areas with a grey-colored ground and a small hole nearby. You'll see it just standing around, until you get close, in which case it'll run away and try to go back to its hole.
 It'll try to run away, but as long as you don't hit any of the rocks in your way, you'll be able to catch it. After catching it, a red exclamation mark will appear above its head and you'll go into battle with it. If you don't catch it, exit and re-enter the area to respawn it. It may not end up respawning, in which case try again until it does.
 Unlike with most wild Pokémon, it's not as simple as weakening it and throwing a Poké Ball. Its ability, Wimp Out, makes it flee the battle if it gets below half health. Your best bet is to throw a Quick Ball at the start of the battle and hope it captures it. If that fails, weaken it a little bit, making sure its health bar is still green, then throw Poké Balls at it. If you're capturing it on Route 8, you can use Nest Balls for an easier capture.

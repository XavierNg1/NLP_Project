 If you have multiple strips, separate them by pulling them away from each other., Locate the black liner, marked “Wall Side.” Hold the unlined portion with one hand as you pull the black-printed layer off the strip.You may need to use your fingernail under an edge of the liner to begin pulling it up.
 Press the sticky side of the strip firmly onto the surface where your hook should hang. Press along the full length of the strip for 30 seconds., Peel off the blue liner. Press the hook firmly onto the strip. Continue pressing the hook for 30 seconds.The adhesive will bond more securely if you strongly press the hook., Wait at least one hour before you use the hook. The adhesive needs time to fully bond to the wall. Its bond will not be as strong if the hook holds weight right away.

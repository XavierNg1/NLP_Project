 Enhance your screams if you have to, but make it look real.
 Also, to make floating objects, attach a really thin string to it so it looks like nothing is holding it. This may take a while, but when its done, it will be worth it.
 This way, you can add backgrounds of places you might not go to (i.e. creepy forest, sewers, etc.)

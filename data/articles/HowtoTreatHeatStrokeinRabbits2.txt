 If the rabbit is not showing signs of improvement, then call the vet and tell them you are having an emergency issue with your rabbit. If your regular veterinarian is not available, for instance the problem is occurring on a day the veterinary office is closed, then you should call an emergency veterinary office in your area.


Your veterinary office may ask you some questions about your rabbit's condition. Then the person on the phone should help you assess whether the rabbit needs to be seen.
 If you need to transport the rabbit to a vet, keep cooling it as you go. Wrap the rabbit in a damp towel and have the air conditioning on in the car.


Transporting a rabbit with heat stroke, while continuing to try to cool it down, may require two people. However, if you don't have anyone to help, just keep the temperature in the car cool and give the rabbit access to cool water.
 Act calmly and quietly. Some rabbit's can really sense stress and react physically to being stressed themselves. They have sensitive systems, so whatever you can do to keep them calm will help.


Petting your rabbit softly and covering its eyes may help to keep it calm., In cases of extreme heat stroke, it is necessary to provide cool intravenous fluids. This will allow the veterinarian to bring the rabbit's core temperature down.This is the best, and usually the only, treatment a veterinarian can provide for heat stroke.


Getting these fluids can also help vital organs that have started to shut down as a result of dehydration.

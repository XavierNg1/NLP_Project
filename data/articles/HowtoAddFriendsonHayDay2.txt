 You can use the Neighborhood House to add more friends by using the search option.


The Neighborhood House is unlocked only after you reach level 18. If you have not reached level 18 in Hay Day, Game Center and Facebook are the only ways to add friends to your farm., Tap on the “magnifying glass” icon to use the search option of the Neighborhood House to look for your friends.
 In the empty space box, type in the name of your friend’s neighborhood and press the “Search” button.


Make sure that you type in the name of your friend’s neighborhood correctly, along with the right spelling.
 Once you have found your friend’s Neighborhood, scroll down to find their name in the list.
 Once you have found your friend in their Neighborhood list, tap on their avatar to view their profile. Your friend will appear in your Hay Day friend list once they have approved your friend request.

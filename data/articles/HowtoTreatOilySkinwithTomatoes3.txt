 Slice the tomato into quarters and the avocado into two halves. Using a spoon, scoop the pulp out of the avocado and discard the skin and pit. Crush the tomato quarters up with a mortar and pestle or other kitchen device, and blend the mashed tomato with the avocado pulp.








There is no need to wash your face prior to using this treatment. The tomato and avocado mixture is designed to clean your pores out.
 Wash your hands to avoid spreading bacteria into your pores. Then, using your fingers, rub the avocado and tomato blend liberally over the oily areas of your face.
 Leave the blended tomato and avocado on your face for at least 20-30 minutes before rinsing. This mask will help cool the skin as well. The tomato works to remove the oil while the avocado offers antiseptic and hydrating properties.








You can let the tomato and avocado sit for a little longer in order to provide deep pore cleansing. 45 minutes to an hour can help you achieve a deep cleanse.
 Use cool or cold water to rinse your skin clean after allowing the avocado and tomato mixture to sit in place for a half hour. Gently pat your skin dry with a clean towel or washcloth.









This treatment will leave your skin feeling younger, more refreshed, and will help eliminate mild to moderate acne. Getting the mixture deep down into your pores removes the oil and bacteria that can clog pores, eliminating the root causes of pimples and blackheads.

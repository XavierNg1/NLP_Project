The groom has picked you to be the best man because you know him the best. Think about his personality, what he likes and what he doesn’t like. Your list could include things such as golf, dinner, a night on the town, a camping trip, a trip to Las Vegas, a party at your apartment or a party in rented room, etc.;

Remember when making this decision, it is ultimately up to you to pull this off, so it must be something you can afford and something you can plan. It is also the groom’s night, so make sure it is everything he wants it to be and more.



Have a serious discussion with the groom before you start planning the bachelor party. Make sure you know what he is okay with and what he is not okay with. If he does not want a wild night that ends with a trip to the strip club, then it is your responsibility to make that clear to the guests.

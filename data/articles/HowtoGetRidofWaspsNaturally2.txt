 Attach the hose end sprayer to the hose. Ensure that the hose reaches to the location of the wasp nest.
 You can use any generic soap, such as Dove, Softsoap, or Dawn. Feel free to put in as much soap as you would like into the hose end sprayer.
 The wasps will have all come home to their nest at night. Therefore you will be able to kill more of them with the soap solution.
 Hold the hose and point it toward the nest. Make sure that you are close enough to spray them powerfully but not so close that youâ€™re likely to be stung.
 Use all of the solution that you have in the garden hose sprayer.The soap will paralyze the wasps, and the water will drown them.
 Wait until the next morning to ensure that all of the wasps have died. Use gloves if you need to handle the nest to put it into a garbage bag.

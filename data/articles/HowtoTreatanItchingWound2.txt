 Neosporin is an antibacterial and anti-itch cream that is used to treat itchy wounds. The cream inhibits the production of protein in bacteria that can result in cell death and cause itchiness.


You can apply medicated creams three times a day, or as directed by a doctor.
 This cream is used for the relief of inflamed and itchy skin. It acts by stabilizing leukotriene lysosomal membranes that prevent the release of acid hydrolases (things that make you feel itchy).


You can apply this cream every 8 to 12 hours to keep your skin from feeling itchy.
 These medications release antihistamines, which inhibit the action of histamines. Histamines cause you to feel itchy. Some commonly used antihistamines include:


Diphenhydramine (Benadryl). It is available in 25 mg and 50 mg pills but you should not take more than 300 mg in a day. Be careful, as benadryl can cause drowsiness.Loratadine (Claritin). It is available in 10 mg tablets and can be taken once a day. This antihistamine generally does not cause drowsiness, but you should still look for the ‘non-drowsy’ banner when purchasing these antihistamines.

 This is your base day and year. The instructions below will demonstrate how to calculate the day of week for any day in 2007. The final steps will show how to move this to other years.
 In 2007, they are all Wednesdays (your base day for that year)


April 4 (4/4), June 6 (6/6), 8/8, 10/10 and 12/12 (December 12). These are easy to remember for Americans or Europeans because of the symmetry.
Also, memorize 7/11, 11/7, 9/5 and 5/9 (Memory aid: The people at the 7/11 work from 9 to 5, and reverse the numbers too).
You now have 1 day-of-week per month from April though December. January, February, and March have your base day (Wednesday for 2007) on 1/31, 2/7, 2/14, 2/21, 2/28, 3/7, 3/14, 3/21, and 3/28. These should be easy to remember because it is 7,14,21,28, and we're doing math by 7s because there are 7 days per week.
You now have 1 day-of-week for every month. From this you should be able to easily calculate the day-of-week for any date in 2007.
, Add an extra day for other months, so although 2006 is Tuesday and 2007 is Wednesday, 2008 is Friday (for March and beyond)

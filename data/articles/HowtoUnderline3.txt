 The quick key-combo for underlining text in Microsoft Word is holding Control and pressing the "U" key.
, After right-clicking the text in Word, you should be able to select font from the options available, then select your underlining options.
 If you want to do this, select "Words only" in the Underline style box on Microsoft Word, or select each word one at a time and underline them.
 If you just want to draw an underline manually, hold the shift button down while you press the "-" key.

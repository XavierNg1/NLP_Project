 To clean and disinfect your water bottle, try soaking it in a mixture of white vinegar and water. Mix one part vinegar with one part water in a bowl. Then, submerge the water bottle in the solution, making sure the solution gets inside the water bottle. Let the bottle soak for one to two minutes.Another option is to fill the bottle with the vinegar and water solution. Then, let the solution sit in the bottle for one to two minutes.
 Once you have soaked the bottle, rinse out the solution. Then, use a damp brush or a sponge to scrub the bottle. Make sure you scrub the mouth and lid of the bottle well, as this is usually where germs live.Scrubbing the bottle will also help to remove any remaining vinegar in the bottle.
 Let the water bottle air dry on a drying rack or a clean towel overnight. If you are in a rush, you can use a clean cloth to dry the bottle. Make sure you dry the mouth and lid of the bottle well.

 Mild pain, redness and swelling may be routine side effects of a cartilage piercing. However, they might also be symptoms of an infection in the tissue beneath the skin. If your piercing aches constantly, doesn’t respond to pain treatments or gets worse after several days, call your doctor or dermatologist right away.Other symptoms like fever, chills or discharge may also point to an infection.
 After your doctor has examined the infected piercing, they’ll most likely prescribe you a round of antibiotics. These drugs will help your immune system fight off the infection. Be sure to follow your doctor’s orders exactly, as different medicines will need to be taken differently.It will be important to know, for example, whether your antibiotic should be taken with food or on an empty stomach.Let your doctor know about other drugs you’re taking (along with any other medical conditions that might be a factor) so they’ll be able to make an informed decision about how best to treat your infection., Continue taking your antibiotics until there are none left. If you don’t, the infection may return and get worse. Check in with your doctor after you’ve completed the first round. You may need a refill in order to clear up the infection for good.You may not notice much of an improvement over the first twenty-four hours, or you may feel completely better after only a few days. Either way, make it a point to stay on track with your course of antibiotics.If necessary, set an alarm to remind yourself to take your medicine. This can be especially helpful if you’ve been directed to take them at different times of day.

Gestational diabetes and giving birth to a baby over 9 pounds can also increase your risk for type 2 diabetes;
, Diabetes is a condition related to blood sugar, so some people might think it’s related to eating sugar. Eating sugar doesn’t cause diabetes — but if you are overweight then you can develop peripheral resistance to sugar; therefore, you have to cut down on the amount of refined sugars that you consume., Many symptoms of diabetes may not seem serious and aren’t necessarily specific to the disease, so it’s important to watch your bodily functions to detect potential signs.Identifying possible symptoms of diabetes can help you get a timely diagnosis and treatment.Symptoms of diabetes cancer include:Increased thirst
Increased hunger, especially after eating
Dry mouth
Frequent urination (sometimes more often at night)

Numbness or tingling in the hands and feet
Cuts and sores that heal slowly
Itchy and dry skin, generally in the vaginal or groin region
Frequent yeast infections
Frequent infections of the skin and gums

Note the symptoms you have and how frequently they occur in a notebook or on a piece of paper. These notes may come in handy if you have to see a doctor.Watch every bodily function that may be related to diabetes including how you feel after you eat, if you’re thirsty more often, if you urinate more often, and even how quickly you heal from cuts or sores.
Write down the specific symptoms, how often they occur, and what makes them better or worse.Make note of any feelings you experience that aren’t necessarily related to diabetes.
 In some cases, your partner or spouse may have noticed symptoms of diabetes that you overlooked. Talk to your spouse about any symptoms you’ve noticed and see if he has made similar observations or any others that might indicate diabetes.

 If your doctor suspects that you have diabetes, she will order additional testing. There are different types of tests to diagnose types 1 and 2 diabetes as well as gestational diabetes.The following tests are used to diagnose diabetes:


A1c blood test, which is also known as a glycated hemoglobin test.This test shows your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months by showing how much blood sugar is attached to your hemoglobin.A level of 6.5 is considered diabetic.Random blood sugar test, which examines your blood sugar at an unspecified time. A level of 200 milligrams per deciliter indicates diabetes.Fasting blood sugar test, which is conducted after an overnight fast.If your blood sugar level is 126 milligrams per deciliter, it’s considered diabetic.Oral glucose tolerance test, which requires overnight fasting and then drinking a sugary liquid the next morning. After this, your blood sugar levels will be tested over the next two hours. A reading of more than 200 milligrams per deciliter, it’s considered diabetes.Initial glucose challenge test and follow-up glucose testing analyze the blood of pregnant women who have fasted and then consumed a sugary liquid. This usually occurs at 24–28 weeks of gestation. If your blood sugar level readings are high for two of three readings, you’ll be diagnosed with gestational diabetes., In some cases, your doctor may notice that your tests have elevated blood sugar levels that don’t qualify for a diabetes diagnosis.This can indicate prediabetes, which means you could develop diabetes; however, prediabetes is also a potentially reversible condition.Test result levels for prediabetes are:5.7–6.4% on the A1c test
100–125 milligram per deciliter for the fasting blood sugar test
140–199 milligram per deciliter for the oral glucose tolerance test

, Depending on the severity of your diabetes, your doctor will likely prescribe different treatments to manage the condition.From insulin injections to healthy eating, following your doctor’s treatment plan is important to manage diabetes and minimize your risk of complications. Medical treatments for diabetes you may receive are:Regular monitoring of your blood sugar at home and by your doctor
Insulin therapy — Including daily injections or an insulin pump
Oral medication — Such as metformin to stimulate your pancreas to produce more insulin (if you have type 2 diabetes)
Physical activity — 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week
Healthy diet — Limiting calories to 1,800–2,000 a day and incorporating more fruits, vegetables, and lean meats and fish
Controlling blood pressure and cholesterol
Surgery such as a pancreas transplant for serious cases
Bariatric surgery, which is a good option for those with a high BMI and comorbid conditions such as hypertension, sleep apnea, elevated cholesterol, fatty liver disease, and others. The weight loss that follows bariatric surgery may cause type 2 diabetes to go into remission.Islet cell transplantation is an experimental treatment for type 1 diabetes in which healthy cells from a donor pancreas are transferred to the patient, In addition to any medical treatments for diabetes, your doctor will likely suggest helping to manage the disease by changing your lifestyle habits. These can also be a way to treat prediabetes and may prevent it from developing into type 2 diabetes.Some lifestyle changes your doctor may suggest to help manage diabetes and prediabetes are:



Eating a balanced and healthy dietGetting at least 150 minutes of exercise per weekLosing weightLosing just 7% of your body weight can significantly reduce your risk of diabetes.Caring for your feet by checking them for injuries daily, keeping them clean, dry, and soft, and wearing breathable shoes and socksCaring for your oral healthLimiting or avoiding tobacco and alcoholReducing stress

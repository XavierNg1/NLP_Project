 One pair should have thick-and-thin sections, and the other pair should have evenly-spaced hairs. Be sure to get the "wispy" type of lashes; the hairs are tied to the lash strip and thus moveable., Take the pair of lashes with the thick-and-thin sections. Use your tweezers to slide the hairs about on the lash strip so that they are more evenly spaced. This will help make your false lashes appear fuller at the outer corner., If there is still some of adhesive left on the strip, use that to stick the lashes to the tray. This will make it easier to stack and glue the lashes together., Use a good-quality eyelash glue for this. If your glue came with an applicator, use that to apply the glue. If the glue didn't, use a thin brush to apply the glue., Take the false lashes with the evenly-spaced hairs. Carefully place it on top of the first pair with the glue on it. You can do this with a pair of tweezers or your fingers. Use the end of a brush or pencil to help push down the corners.

If you want a tapered look to the lashes, off-set the second pair by a little, so that they extend over the outer corners of the first pair. This way, there are fewer, thinner hairs towards the inner corners.
 If you off-set the lashes, be sure to snip off the excess at the outer corner.If the lash strip is still too long, then trim it down further.

 Just like with a book, you begin with the author’s last name, meaning the speaker’s last name. Add a comma and then the speaker’s first name: “Glenn, Becky.” Use a period after the speaker’s first name.;
, If it doesn’t have a title, don’t include anything: “Glenn, Becky. ‘How Words Are Used to Persuade You.’”


Put quotations around the title, and use title case capitalization - meaning you capitalize the first and last word as well as all other important words.
Use a period before the quotation mark.
 “Glenn, Becky. ‘How Words Are Used to Persuade You.’ Marketing Class.”

, Use as much information as you have: “Glenn, Becky. ‘How Words Are Used to Persuade You.’ Marketing Class. Humanities Building, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR.”

, “Glenn, Becky. ‘How Words Are Used to Persuade You.’ Marketing Class. Humanities Building, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR. 28 February 2007.” If you don’t know the date, use “n.d.”

, Be descriptive: “Glenn, Becky. ‘How Words Are Used to Persuade You.’ Marketing Class. Humanities Building, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR. 28 February 2007. Class Lecture.”


Other descriptions that would be appropriate here include “Keynote Address,” “Lecture,” “Speaker Panel,” and “Presentation.”

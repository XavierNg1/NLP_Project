 Riding a steer is a great way to get into riding generally. This is no surprise, as riding a steer is actually comparable to riding certain types of horses. Some riders use steers to lead, drive, perform tricks, and even saddle. Some steers and riders even compete in shows similar to equestrian events.In fact, most of the tasks and activities commonly enjoyed with a horse can likely be done with a steer as well. Granted, your steer will not be able to jump quite as high, nor run as fast.
 One of the bonuses of riding a steer may be the added utility of a steer that can help train horses. Some horses are skittish or aggressive around cattle until they spend enough time around them to learn that they are not a threat. A great way to acclimate a horse to being around cattle is to ride your steer while someone else rides the horse. This will help the horse recognize that cattle aren’t much different than they are., Believe it or not, you can even learn to rope or herd cattle from the back of a steer. Though the other cattle may not take you and your steer seriously at first, keep pestering them and they’ll eventually fall in line. In fact, they may come to be even more comfortable with you when they see you on the back of one their own instead of on a horse.

 Roman numerals were not standardized until modern times. Even the Romans themselves used them inconsistently, and all sorts of variations were used into medieval times and even the 19th and early 20th centuries. If you come across an old text with numerals that don't make sense in the usual system, refer to the steps below for help interpreting it.If you're learning Roman numerals for the first time, ignore this section.
 Most modern users don't like to repeat the same digit if they can avoid it, and never subtracted more than one digit at a time. Old sources didn't obey these rules, but it's usually easy to figure out what they meant. For example:


VV = 5 + 5 = 10
XXC = (10 + 10) subtracted from 100 = 100 - 20 = 80

, Confusingly, old texts sometimes use the smaller digit in front of the larger to mean multiplication, not subtraction. For example, VM might mean 5 x 1000 = 5000. There's not always an easy way to tell when this is happening, but sometimes the number is slightly altered:


A period between the two numbers: VI.C = 6 x 100 = 600.
A subscript: IVM = 4 x 1000 = 4000.
 In old printed works, the symbol j or J is sometimes used instead of i or I at the end of a number. More rarely, an extra tall I at the end of a word can signify 2 instead of 1.


For example, xvi or XVJ, both equal 16.
xvI = 10 + 5 + 2 = 17

, Early printers sometimes used a symbol called the apostrophus, similar to a backwards C or a ) symbol. This and variations of it were only used for large numbers:


M was sometimes written as CI) or ∞ by early printers, or as a ϕ in ancient Rome.
D was sometimes written as I)
Enclosing the above numbers inside additional ( and ) symbols meant multiplication by ten. For example, (CI)) = 10,000 and ((CI))) = 100,000.

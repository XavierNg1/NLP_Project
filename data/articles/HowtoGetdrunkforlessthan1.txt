 The most difficult thing to buy is 'fresh' yeast. It's the type of yeast people use for baking bread etc. Usually it comes in small, square packs. In many European countries you can buy them in your local supermarket. In countries like Britain and Ireland, you'll probably find them in Russian/German/Lithuanian/Polish/Hungarian/Slovak shops. I've read that in North America you're able to get them in some supermarkets. In the worst case try to contact a local bakery or pizza place they should have them as well. A small pack of yeast is around 50c or less.;
,,, Pour the liquid into the bottle.
,, MAKE SURE that you check on it every 2-3 hours. You'll notice that the bottle is growing bigger, release the excess air (it's actually CO2) once in a while. Do it VERY SLOWLY. See -> warnings below.

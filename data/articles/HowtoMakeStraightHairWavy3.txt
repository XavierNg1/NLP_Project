 Starting with dry hair, rub a quarter-sized dollop of hair product through your hair. Mousse and texturizer are good options. These will both give your hair volume and help hold the style longer.


If you have short hair, use less hair product in your hair. Otherwise, your hair can get weighted down too much.Find a strong hold mousse to get maximum hold throughout the day., This size of curling iron will allow you to make a slightly tighter curl in your hair. The heat from the curling iron will be able to reach every strand of hair more easily this way. If you use a large-barreled curling iron, your hair will not hold the waves as well., Take the hair around the crown of your head and pin it up. This will keep it out of the way while you curl the hair underneath.
 Take one small chunk of hair at a time and wrap it around the curling iron. Hold for a few seconds and let it go.
 Continue to curl your hair, taking down the hair that has been pinned up.
 You don’t want all the curls to stay in corkscrews. Turn your head upside down and toss your head around.








Don’t comb your fingers through the curls unless you want a very subtle wave.
 Use a strong hold hairspray to cover your hair. Spritz hairspray all over. Careful not to overdo it, especially if you have shorter hair. Too much hairspray will make your hair look crunchy.

 Trim off excess bread on the ends if the slices are too big to fit in the slots. Make sure the sides of the toast aren't rubbing against the heat coils.









If you cram it in, the ends are going to burn and stink up the kitchen. Make sure the slices aren't too thick or too wide.
 Depending on the type and thickness of the bread, and on how brown or crunchy you want it, set the knob higher or lower. If you are unsure, put on a low setting and if necessary after, repeat at a higher setting.









Toasters, especially cheap ones, are often unreliable in the "darkness" knob department. Many people complain that even at the highest setting, you need to toast multiple times. It's best to start it light to make sure you don't burn the toast, then increase if you need to toast it a second time.
 Keep an eye on the toaster to make sure it doesn't burn, then carefully remove the hot toast from the toaster after it pops up when it completes the cycle.

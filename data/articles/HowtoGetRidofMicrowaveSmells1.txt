 Combine ½ cup (118 ml) of water with 1 tablespoon of white vinegar in a large microwave-safe bowl. Put the mixture in your microwave and nuke for roughly five minutes at its highest setting. Then let it sit with the door closed for about 10 to 15 minutes. This will enable any gunk or crusted bits of food to absorb the steam, which should work them loose and negate most odors., First, take out the bowl of water and vinegar. Be sure to wear oven mitts or another form of protection, since the bowl may still be hot. Then remove the glass plate, as well as the turntable support or rolling ring that the plate rests on (if your microwave has one)., Dampen a paper towel, microfiber cloth, or similar material. Use this to scrub the inside of your microwave, as well as the inside of the door. Repeat as necessary if you need more than one towel or cloth., If bits of food have cooked into a crust that’s too tough for a paper towel or cloth to handle, switch to a scrub brush. Combine one part water with two parts vinegar in a bowl or spray bottle. Then either dip your brush in or spray the area inside your microwave and scrub vigorously., Clean these in the sink as you would any regular dishware. Use warm water, dish soap, and a sponge to give them a thorough scrubbing. Rinse them under clean water and then dry them with a dish towel before placing them back in the microwave.

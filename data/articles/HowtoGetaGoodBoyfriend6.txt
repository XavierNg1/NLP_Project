 A good relationship will flourish when you have common interests and do things together. You might go snowboarding together or join a language class. Your relationship will last longer when you commit to doing active and interesting things together., Although you and your boyfriend have common interests, you also have your own interests. In a successful relationship, both partners will make an effort to do each other’s favorite activities from time to time.
 A good boyfriend will pay attention to you, not his phone. It’s okay to check messages once in a while, but if he is constantly checking sports scores or social media updates from friends, his attention is wandering away from you. A gentle reminder to put away his phone may be warranted, but if you have to constantly remind him, there might be a larger conversation about why he is choosing to ignore you.


Make sure you also turn off your phone. He needs to feel like you’re paying attention to him too.
 A good boyfriend will be affectionate with you by being physically close and cuddling. Your physical chemistry is important for long-term happiness, so good sex is definitely important. But it’s also important to be affectionate with hand-holding or snuggling while watching a movie.

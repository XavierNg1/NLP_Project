 The durability that makes epoxy grout so resilient can haunt you if you allow the haze to settle in on your tile. Try to clean the haze within 12-24 hours of installation. The longer you wait, the more difficult it will be to remove the haze., There are cleaners specifically designed for picking up grout haze. Purchase them online or at a specialty hardware store. Follow the instruction on the box, mixing the cleaner with cool water., Dip a white scrub pad in the cleaner and then rub the tile with the pad. Avoid coming into contact with the grout as much as possible. Though it is unlikely that you will need to reapply grout, you donâ€™t want the cleaner to accidently pick up any of the grout., After the cleaner has been applied, use a separate sponge to wide down the surface, picking up the residue. Regularly soak and squeeze the sponge to remove dirt., Give the tile a few minutes to dry. If the cleaner picked some haze, but more remains, try using it again until all the haze is gone., Using sand can damage the tile, but can remove grout haze when other methods fail. Mix silica sand, detergent, and water until they form a paste. Use a sponge or scrub pad to thoroughly scrub the haze off the tile. Rinse the area off after the haze has been removed.


Mix approximately one part detergent for every fourteen parts of water. Add enough sand that the solution becomes thick.Only use this method when it seems absolutely necessary.

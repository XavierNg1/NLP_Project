Accelerate smoothly and gently when leaving intersections and stop signs. It is inconsiderate of other drivers and even contributes to congestion at intersections, to dawdle once the light turns green. But it isn't necessary to hit the gas with a heavy foot either. The harder your engine has to work, the more gas you burn.
Paying attention to traffic avoids the necessity for sudden acceleration, turns and braking. Be aware of what is ahead, behind and around you. It is not only safer to maintain an appropriate distance between you and cars ahead, but it allows you to maintain a more constant speed. Repetitive acceleration and braking uses more gas and increases brake wear.
Avoid sharp turning. Execute a proper arch when making turns. Many intersections are laid out with turning arches. Following a good arch reduces wear on tires, suspension and brakes, as well as reducing fuel consumption. You will also discover that you actually clear the intersection quicker and more comfortably than those who drive to the "post," then have to make a hard turn to straighten out and proceed.;
, It is less expensive to keep your car in good shape than it is to pay for a major repair.


Ensure that your tire pressure is kept up. Proper air pressure in your tires reduces resistance to rolling. It is not only safer and improves handling, but reduces fuel consumption and tire wear.
Today's cars don't require tune-ups nearly as often as they once did, but they still need regular care and inspection. Even newer vehicles have time/mileage limited parts that require adjustment or replacement at some point. Having a professional mechanic servicing your vehicle can catch damage and spot leaks or wear early, thereby preventing further damage, accelerated wear and expense.
Oil, oil filter and air filter maintenance are imperative to preserving engine life. At a minimum, adhere to the manufacturer's schedule. Clean air entering the engine is as important as clean oil. Oil and oil filtration cannot prevent damage caused by sand and other destructive particles that enter the cylinders from the top.
Don't forget about your fuel system. Fuel injectors can form deposits at the nozzles and will require cleaning. This has a direct affect on fuel economy and performance. Regular maintenance as mentioned above would include fuel system maintenance, but it bears specific mention.
 There are several good reasons to move to this technology. This can save you money on oil changes and maintenance. Keep in mind that ester-based lubricants were developed for turbine engines because petroleum oils simply couldn't do the job.


Pure synthetic lubricants make possible extended drain intervals that traditional petroleum oils can't sustain. Most petroleum oils are expected to maintain their efficiency for 3,000 miles (4,828 km.) or approximately 3 months. Pure synthetic lubricants can provide from 7,000 miles (11,265 km.), and up to 35,000 miles (56,327 km.) and 1 year service life, depending on the specific oil.
Synthetic lubricants provide superior lubricating qualities: reducing friction, more efficient cooling and cleaning. This translates into reduced wear of all wetted components, extended service life and reduced maintenance and repair costs. These optimum lubricating qualities and benefits also apply to transmission and gear lubricants.
Extended drain intervals result in fewer oil changes per year, saving you money. Of course pure synthetics cost more. But over the course of a year, you save a significant amount.
Extended drain intervals also result in reducing the amount of waste oil per year. So, changing over to pure synthetic lubricants saves you money in oil changes, reduces waste oil and provides superior protection and performanceï¿½including better fuel economy.

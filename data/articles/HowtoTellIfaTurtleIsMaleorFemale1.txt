 The turtle’s shell, or carapace, differs slightly between male and female. An adult female turtle has a slightly longer shell than an adult male has.As a means of sexing the turtle, this method is limited because you need to make sure that the turtle is fully grown. You may assume that a turtle is male due to a smaller size when it actually has more growing to do.
There can be an overlap in size between a large male and a small female, so it’s not possible to predict the gender based on size alone.;
, The underside of the shell, which covers the turtle equivalent of a belly, is called the plastron. To check the plastron, pick the turtle up with care. They do not like be handled and may try to bite, so grasp the turtle from the tail end so it can't reach around and snap at you. Gently turn the turtle over so you can see the underside. In male turtles, the plastron is slightly concave (curving inwards), whereas a female's is flat.A concave plastron allows for a male turtle to fit over a female’s shell during mating without rolling off.
The female’s flatter plastron gives her more room internally in which to grow eggs.
 Male turtles often have a small 'V,' or notch, at the rear end of the carapace. This is to accommodate the tail when the turtles mate. Otherwise the tail might be crushed against the underside of his shell., Some species of turtles have gender-specific external features. Some species that may reveal gender through coloring are:


The American box turtle: 90 percent of the time, male box turtles have red or orange irises while the female has brown or yellow ones. Also, the female has a tendency to have a higher-domed, more rounded shell, whereas the male has a lower shell with more of an oval or oblong appearance.
Sun turtle: If the turtle's underbelly has blue coloring, it's a male. If the underbelly does not have blue coloring, it's a female.

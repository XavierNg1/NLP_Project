 You'll need about 1/2 of a leftover pecan pie (16 ounces or 450 g). Use a sharp knife to carefully cut the pie into 3-inch (7.5 cm) pieces. Put the pie in a food processor and pulse the pie off and on for 30 seconds. The pie will look like chunky nut butter.Ensure that the pie is chilled when you start making the truffles.
 Add the remaining truffle ingredients to the food processor with the blended pie. Put the lid on and pulse the ingredients 3 or 4 times to incorporate the ingredients. You'll need to add:1/4 cup (25 g) of unsweetened cocoa
1 1/2 tablespoons of bourbon, optional
4 ounces (110 g) of chopped dry-roasted, salted almonds

, Transfer the truffle mixture to a bowl. Cover the mixture with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator. Let the truffle mixture chill for at least 1 hour.Chilling the filling will make it easier to handle and shape the truffles.
 Lay a sheet of parchment paper or a silicone mat on a baking sheet. Use teaspoons to scoop the truffle mixture onto the paper or mat. Put the baking sheet in the freezer for one hour. If the truffles are firm before then, you can remove them and continue making them.The truffle portions should be about 2 teaspoons so you end up with 48 portions.
 Use a knife or food processor to chop the remaining 3.5 ounces (95 g) of dry-roasted, salted almonds. Put the chopped nuts in a shallow dish. Take the hard truffles out of the freezer and use your hands to gently roll each portion into a ball. Roll each ball in the chopped nuts. Let the truffles soften for a few minutes before serving them.You can store the truffles in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
Dip your hands in water before rolling the truffles. This can keep the truffles from melting and sticking to the palms of your hands.

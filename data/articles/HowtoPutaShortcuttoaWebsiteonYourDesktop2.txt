 If you use the Chrome browser, you can create a shortcut to the website on your desktop that uses the website's custom icon (favicon). This feature is not currently available on Mac computers.
 You'll find this in the upper-right corner of the Chrome window.
 A new window will appear.


If you don't see this option, you may not be running the latest version of Chrome. Select "Help" â†’ "About Google Chrome" from the Chrome menu and then install any available updates.
 By default, the shortcut will have the same name as the site's title. You can change it to whatever you'd like.
 If you check the "Open as window" box, the shortcut will always open in its own window, making it act more like an application. This can be very useful for services like WhatsApp messenger or Gmail.
 You'll see a new icon on your desktop, which will be the same icon that the website uses.
 If you didn't select "Open as window," the shortcut will open in a regular Chrome browser window. If you selected "Open as window," the site will load in its own dedicated window without any of the regular Chrome interface.

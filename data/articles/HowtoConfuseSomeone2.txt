 A non-sequitur is a response that doesn't follow from the conversations or answers preceding it. Here are a few examples of common questions or greetings, along with confusing responses you can use:


"Hi, how are you?" — "You're the first person to say that to me. What does it mean?"
"Excuse me, do you have the time?" — "No, but I saw it flying that way a few minutes ago."
"(any sentence with a technical term or proper noun)" — "Sorry, I'm not really into Pokémon.""Good morning" — (angrily) "I can't believe you got arrested tomorrow!" — "What?" — (cheerily) "Good chatting with you, talk to you later!"

, For example, ask a stranger to lend you her shoes, let you adopt her dog, or help you install your electric lines. When she refuses, stare at her with an expression of shock, mutter "people these days," and walk away.Say "kids these days" instead, but only when talking to someone clearly older than yourself.
 This works best if you act and talk as though you were completely normal, then surprise people with one of the following actions:


Drop to the floor and crawl or crab-walk away. Graham Chapman of Monty Python used to crawl around at important dinner functions and rub against people's legs.Stand at attention and salute someone.Bonus points if you set your cell phone to play your country's national anthem.
 Ask someone who lives in your friend's house to let you and your assistants in while he's away. Prank your friend with confusing alterations to his room. This prank is best reserved for very close friends, with a good sense of humor.


Photograph his room, take everything out of it, then return it exactly the way it was before... in a perfect mirror image.
Wrap every object in the room with newspaper, including the furniture.

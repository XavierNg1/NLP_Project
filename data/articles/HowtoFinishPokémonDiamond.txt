 Not too far in the game, you'll find a briefcase. Then, you will be attacked by a Starly. At this point, you choose your starting Pokémon. You can choose Piplup - the water type, Chimchar - the fire type, or Turtwig - the grass type. The chosen Pokémon will then battle the Starly. Note: whichever Pokémon you choose will become your starting fighter.;
, Gain experience by fighting wild Pokémon. Practice with all of your Pokémon, not just your starter. Sometimes, trainers only ever do this at the beginning of the game and forget to train later on. You only need to continue this until you find the VS Seeker. Once you find this, you can battle other trainers instead of wild Pokémon.
 At the beginning, worry less about only choosing good Pokémon. Just work at getting more. Later on, however, you should be more selective.
 Gyms are good practice. If you are unsure who to use in battle, talk to the person standing at the gym entrance. His suggestion will be based on Pokémon type matching. He does not take into account your skill with a particular Pokémon.
 All HM's apart from Surf are useless in battle. Don't waste a move slot with one of these. A HM slave is a Pokémon who you teach HM's to, you never use this Pokémon in battle. Bidoof, Bibarel, Geodude, Graveler, Marill, and Azumarill are good choices, but experiment for yourself.
 Choosing moves for your Pokémon may seem daunting, but it is really quite simple. Don't teach more than one attack to any one Pokémon. Pay attention to PP and Accuracy as well as Attack Power. A move with at least 15 PP, 90% Accuracy, and 70 attack power is alright. Teach all your Pokémon at least one basic attack move, then you can go wild with moves that will boost stats, and moves that will cause your opponents status problems.

 Click on "reply";
, Although a simple "thank you" may suffice for some emails, many more will require more effort on your part. Here are a few pointers:


Be specific. State why you are thanking the person; for example, you could say "Thank you for answering my question. Your assistance is very much appreciated".
Be brief. You don't want them to have to spend 15 minutes reading your lengthy thank-you note.
Use proper grammar and punctuation.
Smile. Much like a phone call, the reader can "hear" a smile in an email.

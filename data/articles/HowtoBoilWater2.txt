 Just about every harmful microorganism found in water will die when the water is heated.Boiling will not remove most chemical contamination.








If the water is cloudy, filter the water first to remove dirt.
 It's the heat that kills microorganisms, not the boiling action itself. However, without a thermometer, a rolling boil is the only accurate way to tell how hot the water is. Wait until the water is steaming and churning. By this point, all the dangerous organisms should be dead.
 To be extra cautious, leave the water at a rolling boil for 1 minute. (Count to 60 slowly.) If you are higher than 6,500 ft (2,000 m) above sea level, let it boil for 3 minutes instead. (Count to 180 slowly.)








Water boils at a lower temperature at high elevations. This slightly cooler water takes longer to kill organisms.
 Even after cooling, the boiled water will be safe to drink. Keep it in clean, closed containers.








The water will taste "flat" compared to normal water, because some of the air inside it escaped. To improve the taste, pour the water back and forth between two clean containers.The water will trap more air as it falls.
 If you will have access to electricity, bring along an electric heating coil. If not, carry a camping stove or kettle, plus a fuel source or batteries.
 If you have no way to boil water, put the water in a clear, plastic container. Leave it for at least six hours in direct sunlight. This will kill some dangerous bacteria, but it is not as safe as boiling.

 Use your firm, flat brush to brush your lightest color onto the inside corner of your eyes and directly under your eyebrows. This will highlight the areas of your face responsible for making your eyes look larger and brighter.
 Use your stiff flat brush to apply your middle color along your entire eyelid. Start from the base of your lash line and your work way to slightly above the crease. Try to avoid brushing it up to meet your highlighter, though.
 Use your domed brush first to apply your darkest color along your upper lash line. Sweep the color across your entire lid, but only on the bottom ⅓. Then, use your pencil brush to apply a darker, more precise line of color along your lash line.
 Use your pencil brush to add a bit of your darkest eye shadow color along your bottom lash line. Start at the outside corner and work your way to the inside corner, making it gradually lighter as you get closer to your inner tear duct.
 Use your dome brush after it has been cleaned well to blend your shadows together. You want to create a smooth graduation of color, so take a few minutes to softly fade your darkest shadow up into the middle hue. Avoid contacting the line of dark shadow near your lash line too much, as you don’t want to make that part look too faded from blending.

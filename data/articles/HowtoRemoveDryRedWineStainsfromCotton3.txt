 If your clothing is white, you can rub white wine over it. When you want to get rid of the smell, simply hand-wash the cotton., Mix a paste of equal increments tartar cream and water. Rub the paste into the fabric as you would any other treatment. This mixture should help moisten the fabric and gradually bleach the stain away.
 First, soak the fabric in water to help maintain a soft texture for the affected spot. Next, apply any solvent material (such as kerosene) to the stained area. Let the solvent soak in. Then, wash the stain with a standard bar soap. Rub the stain with bar soap until it is gone.


The solvent should ease removal without damaging the material. If you apply detergent immediately, it can harm the material due to its harsh chemical composition.
 If your cotton is white, you can use bleach. Otherwise, look for cleaning products that do not harm the material.

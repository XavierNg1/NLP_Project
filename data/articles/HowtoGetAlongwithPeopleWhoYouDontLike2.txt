 People often assume what they see is someone's personality, not a temporary reaction. If you see someone shouting, that is often the result of a bad day, not anger management issues.


Psychologists call this the "fundamental attribution error" or "correspondence bias."

, People tend to think events are more about themselves than they actually are. If someone is acting stiff or rude, it's often because he's thinking of something else, not trying to offend you. If someone doesn't mention your new haircut, it's usually because he hasn't noticed, not because he wants to make you unhappy.
 Find something good you can say about the other person, and repeat it to yourself or out loud when you start complaining. If you don't know about any positive actions this person has done, compliment her on her clothing or her car. If she talks frequently about a topic, even if it's not one you are interested in, tell her you're impressed by her depth of knowledge on that topic.
 Get to know the other person by asking questions. Stay away from personal topics if you don't know him well, but follow up threads in the conversation by asking more about a person, place, or event that he mentions.
 Some people behave very differently in large groups or energetic environments than they do in one-on-one conversations or in quiet situations. If you would like to give someone another chance, try meeting them in a different context than you normally would. Invite them to a gathering with a different group of friends, or talk to a coworker over lunch in a cafe.


If there's no hope for a friendship at this point, or at least a cordial acquaintanceship, move on to the next section.

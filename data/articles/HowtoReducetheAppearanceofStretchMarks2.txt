 Stretch marks usually fade from a deep red to a pale silver over time. You can help them fade faster and to a less noticeable color by protecting your skin from sun damage. The sun's rays can weaken the skin and cause the stretch marks to look worse.Use sunscreen with a SPF 15 or higher each time you expose your stretch marks to the sun. Be sure to reapply it regularly.
If you get a light burn, treat it with aloe vera to help heal the skin as quickly as possible.
 Keeping your skin moisturized won't directly fade stretch marks, but it can help your skin stay healthy and supple. Skin that is dry tends to lose elasticity, which can make stretch marks and other blemishes stand out all the more. While there is no definite way to prevent stretch marks, some say that keeping your skin moisturized keeps them from looking too severe.


Regularly exfoliate your skin before bathing, then apply a rich moisturizer to the area where you have stretch marks to keep your skin from getting dry.
If you have very dry skin, try using a room humidifier to keep the air in your home moist. Aim to keep the humidity between 30 and 50 percent for soft, well-moisturized skin.
 When your body is dehydrated, your skin tends to show wrinkles more easily. The same goes for stretch marks. Hydrating your body makes your skin look healthy and supple, helping to make the appearance of stretch marks less severe.


Drink water when you feel thirsty. Try carrying a reusable water bottle with you throughout the day so you'll always have a drink on hand.
Replace alcoholic and caffeinated drinks with water whenever possible.
 Cigarette smoke deteriorates the skin.Any skin blemish you have will only worsen if you're in frequent contact with cigarette smoke. To keep your skin looking young and healthy, take measures to quit smoking as soon as possible.

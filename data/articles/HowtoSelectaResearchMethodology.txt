 It is essential to understand and have clarity about what you want to research before deciding upon how to research. To use an analogy, if Research is a journey goal is the destination and methodology is the route. Determine the variables that need to be studied in order to get an answer to the research question.Â If the goals serve as the destination of the journey then the variables are the milestones. Just as the milestones guide you through the journey and keep you from going astray, sticking to the variables, and working upon the variables, helps reach the end goal on time in the best possible way.;
, There are a slew of ways to conduct a research but not all are meant for your research. Determining the right methodology in dark can be very difficult. It is a good idea to read previous studies in your area and find out the methodology they used and the limitations or recommendations of the same.
 Not all forms of data collection are same, while some are time consuming, others might need more labor days, while the rest might be expensive. It is essential to base your decision after giving a thought to these limitations.
 Once you choose a particular approach to conduct your research, it is essential to put down everything on a paper, including the approximate time and resources each step might consume. This will help you get a clear idea of the route that your research would take and the hurdles on the way.

 In most cases, your character will remain on the stage for a least a few minutes after the death. In order to really sell the death, you should “die” on your stomach or on your side with your back to the audience. That way, it won’t be as obvious that you’re still breathing after your character has supposedly died.It’s important to practice the choreography that places you in your final position for the death. You don’t want to have to roll over or adjust yourself in the middle of the scene.
 Just because you’re no longer involved in the play’s action doesn’t mean that your work is over. The other cast members need to believe that your character is truly dead, so they can convincingly play the emotions that they go through in the aftermath. That means it’s imperative that you remain still after you’ve “died.” Even something as small as using your thumb to scratch the palm of your hand can pull them out of the moment.If you know that you have difficulty remaining still, talk to the director to see if there is any way to conceal you. For example, it might be appropriate to have the other characters cover you with a sheet. It may also be possible to stage the death so it takes place further back on the stage where they can lower the lights.
 Even if you’re concealed under a sheet or dimmed lights, you may still be noticeable to your co-stars, as well as the audience. If you’re breathing deeply, there may be movement that shatters the illusion even if you’re doing your best to remain still. For the few minutes that you have to remain on stage after the death, try to take slow, shallow breaths, as you would if sleeping, so your chest doesn’t move as much.Keeping your mouth closed and breathing through your nose can often help you keep your breathing shallow.
Try to take as deep a breath as you can during the actual death scene, so you have some time before you need to breathe deeply again. You can disguise it by gasping or shuddering through it.

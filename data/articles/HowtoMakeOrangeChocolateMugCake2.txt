 Add 4 tablespoons (31 g) of all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons (15 g) of cocoa powder, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of baking powder, and 2 tablespoons (25 g) of sugar to a small bowl. Whisk the ingredients together well so they’re fully combined., Once the dry ingredients are mixed, add a slightly beaten egg, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of orange juice, and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of oil. Whisk the mixture well until it is fully blended and there are no lumps.Vegetable or canola oil work best for the mug cake.
 When the batter is completely mixed, pour it into a microwave safe mug. Heat it in the microwave on high for 3 minutes or until the cake is firm and set on top.You can substitute a microwavable ramekin for the mug if you prefer.
 Once the mug cake is finished heating, remove it from the microwave. Sprinkle some orange peels on top for garnish, and serve it immediately.

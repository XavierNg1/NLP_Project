 Ask one of your friends or a friend of the guy who likes you to try talking to him about how you’re not interested and he should give it up. He might listen better when it comes from someone else.


Also ask your friends or his friends to stop making jokes about the two of you getting together, or any other encouragement they try to give him. The guy that likes you might just want the attention or be pursuing you because his friends egg him on.
 If you feel really annoyed or threatened by him, it’s a good time to talk to a parent or other adult for more help. Just tell them that there’s a guy who likes you and won’t leave you alone. The adult can offer you more advice, or talk to the guy or his parents.


If you feel uncomfortable talking to a parent or other adult, try writing down what you want to say first before you say it. Also decide what you want from the adult beforehand so you can ask them. Say, “I just want you to help me figure out what to do about something,” or, “I need you to talk to someone’s parents for me.”, If a guy still persists with unwanted attention in any way after you’ve made it clear with your speech and actions that you aren’t interested, talks or sends messages in a way that is threatening, or shows up at your house or somewhere to see you uninvited, speak up and tell the police.

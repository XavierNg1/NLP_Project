 Look on trees in gaps in between branches, or in the corners of a shed for a web. If there isn't a spider on the web, try poking the web with a stick to imitate a trapped fly. This will lure out the creature from its hiding place.


When you can see the spider, place a plastic tub (lid off) in front of it on its web and the lid behind. Then, close the tub sealing the spider in.;
, Find a net enclosure for insects like butterflies. If one isn't available you may use a large transparent plastic storage box. Make sure you make breathing holes.


This can be achieved by poking a hot metal skewer through the plastic. Fill the container with bits of branch. Strip off most of the leaves, but leave some for hiding places. Release the spider into the container and put on the lid.
 This may take a day or two.
 Flies work well.


Catch flies in several ways. Try using a small dish of fruit syrup or honey, fly tape, or butterfly nets. Be aware that kitchen garbage is a prime attractant, so you may wish to set up your traps near a garbage receptacle.
 (Longer than this may result in your spider dying of starvation).
 Spiders do not hibernate in warm temperatures, and the supply of flies diminishes dramatically in cooler weather, which makes spider-keeping problematic in winter.

 In the United States, the most vital precaution you must take in advertising your business in any form is to ensure you’re targeting adults over the age of 21. The images you use cannot appeal to children and you cannot post print content in areas within 1,000 feet (300 m) of a school, playground, child care center, recreational center, public park, library, or game arcade.Your marketing materials cannot contain cartoons characters, toys, or other depictions that would appeal to minors.
 Avoid using plays on other registered products or services, regardless of their industry. Pay special attention when naming edible products to avoid copyright infringement and a subsequent lawsuit.For example, a dispensary that sold edibles called Reefer’s Cups was sued by Hershey’s. Major corporations will waste no time in going after small cannabis-related businesses to disassociate themselves from the industry.
 The industry exists in many grey areas and its public perception is evolving. You should make an effort to use your brand to advance positive, informative content and avoid negative stereotypes.Maintain fair labor practices, abide by all of your local jurisdiction’s applicable laws, and represent your business with professionalism.
Avoid derogatory and sexist messaging.
For legal and professional purposes, avoid advocating over consumption of marijuana.

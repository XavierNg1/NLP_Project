 That is basically permanent, and I do not recommend attempting to remove marker from the label, short of removing the label and replacing it.;
, You'll need: Paper towels, and you can use either isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol, or you can use Clorox wipes. Check that the Clorox wipes do not contain bleach.
 Don't go crazy, it doesn't take a lot to remove it. Use a paper towel and hold it over the label while you are cleaning. Also, cover the cartridge opening if the marker is near the opening.
 Push hard enough to remove the marker, but don't push so hard the paper towel begins to rip. If you are using a Clorox wipe, the soap that is on the cartridge should turn black.
 The marker should start lightening.
,, The cartridge should not feel as if it is breaking or being crushed. The paper towel also should not rip.

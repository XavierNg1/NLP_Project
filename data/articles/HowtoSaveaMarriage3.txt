 A marriage is also about commitment, a commitment that puts other people ahead of oneself. If you feel like rededicating your commitment to your marriage, consider making it physical or tangible to that your spouse can see that commitment. Gift your spouse a:


Ring
Picture
Flower or plant (something growing)
Meal
Work of art (made by you)

, Couples whose marriages are in danger often take trips, both faraway and close, because the monotony of life back home has them taking each other for granted. When the obligations of work, kids, and family go away, couples rediscover why they fell in love in the first place.



Note: a vacation can be a pretty poor litmus test of whether the relationship is going to succeed. A vacation is all play and no work. Going back to the familiar routine of work, family upkeep, and chores can cause the fairy tale ending to end very quickly.
 A loving marriage is one in which both partners still enjoy the thought of being with one another all alone. Some couples try to engineer a date night every week, others every couple of weeks. At the very least, try to plan a date night with just you and your spouse once a month. This should help reignite your passion for one another, as well as eliminating some of the more tedious responsibilities of everyday life.

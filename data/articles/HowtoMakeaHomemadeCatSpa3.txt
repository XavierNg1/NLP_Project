 Check that they look healthy — they should be clear, with the area around the iris a bright white. Using a damp cotton ball, wipe away any of the dirt that collects at the edges of your cat’s eyes.Use a separate piece of cotton wool for each eye.
 Some cats get hairs on their faces that are so long that they can poke your cat in the eye or get in the way of his vision. This can especially be a problem for long-haired cats. Brush any hair on the facial area with a toothbrush, not a wire comb or brush.
 Ask your veterinarian for a recommendation of a good ear cleaner you can buy at the pet store. Be aware that some of the ear cleaners sold in pet stores are not suitable for use in cats, so make sure you talk to the vet first. Put a drop of the cleaner onto a cotton ball or piece of gauze.Fold your cat’s ear back and gently rub away the dirt and earwax that has gathered there.
Do not rub at the ear — just dab and lift with the cotton ball or gauze.
Be sure to stay away from the ear canal — it is sensitive and trying to clean it can easily cause infection.

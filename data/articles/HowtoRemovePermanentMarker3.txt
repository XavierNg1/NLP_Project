 Spray some aerosol hairspray onto a clean cloth and use this to scrub at the marker stain. You may need to use more hairspray or switch to a cleaner section of the cloth before the stain is fully removed.


Once the stain has disappeared, clean off any hairspray residue with a clean, damp cloth and work a little leather conditioner into the furniture.
 To clean a marker stain from microfiber upholstery, apply a small amount of hydrogen peroxide to a clean towel and use this to scrub at the stain for 10 15 minutes.


Next, apply a little rubbing alcohol to a different towel and use this to scrub the stain for 10 to 15 minutes.
Use a third clean towel dampened with water to clean off any remaining marker. Blot the area dry using a dry towel.
 Other types of upholstery will usually respond to stain removal using Windex, rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover. All of these use the same method:


Apply a little of your chosen cleaning agent to a clean, dry towel and use it to dab at the stain (not run) until clean. Some people find that towels that match the color of the upholstery work best.
You may need to apply the cleaning agent to a new section of the towel and continue dabbing a number of times before the stain comes away. Just don't let the fabric become soaked in the cleaning agent, as this could stain.
Once the stain has been removed, pat up any excess moisture in the fabric using a clean, dry towel. If possible, place the furniture outdoors to dry completely.

 Want to shave hours off of your progression to high-end equipment? Try this spawn, which starts you near a village containing nine diamonds and a two iron chestplates — not bad for the first minutes of the game!

, This seed spawns you near a basic village not far from a deep, deep canyon. Finding a way to climb safely down can be an interesting challenge, but if you get frustrated, just take a leap down into one of the pools of water at the bottom, which should break your fall.Tip: If you jump into the ravine, make sure you have the resources to get back out!


, This seed creates a world with several different biomes and several scattered villages. However, if you want to experience these things, you'll need to be alert, as the spawn point is very near to a zombie-spawning room. You'll have to work quick to get the equipment to fight them — or run!, This seed is perfect for players looking for nautical adventure. With many small, unique islands (including mushroom islands) scattered throughout a giant ocean, you'll need a boat to get around. Once you have one, though, cruising from sight to sight is a blast alone or with friends!

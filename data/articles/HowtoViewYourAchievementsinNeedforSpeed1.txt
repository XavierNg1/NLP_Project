 Free Roam is a mode in the game (and most other modern NFS titles) that allows you to tour the city for familiarization or to find races you can engage in.
 This will display your NFSW achievements in a dialogue box.


To switch between different categories of achievements (Completed, In Progress, All), click the left-right arrows near the top right corner of the achievements dialogue box.
To close the dialogue box and return to Free Roam mode, hit “I” again.

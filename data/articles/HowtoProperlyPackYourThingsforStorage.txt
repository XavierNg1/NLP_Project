 If you are packing your things, you have to separate the items that are necessities from those that you will not use immediately.;
, Boxes are not the same – they have different sizes. Of course, you have to place small items in smaller boxes and huge items into bigger boxes. Apart from boxes, other packing materials you have to invest in will include packing tapes, scissors, labeling materials, and more.
 Whenever possible, you have to place similar items in one box only, avoid mixing it all up. If you are to place heavy items like books, CD, and other media items, in a single box, be sure that the box you will use can hold the weight and can still be lifted. You may make use of pillows, comforters, towels, and blankets as top-of-the-box filler. This can help in preventing your stuff from being damaged when other boxes are placed on top of such box.
 Labeling every box you pack is very important. This will prevent you from opening all the boxes whenever you need to get something from your storage unit. You can actually use colors to label each box; however, experts still recommend writing the box with bold black markers specifying the contents of such box.
 Basically, you have to place those that you won’t use immediately on the inner portion of the unit. On the other hand, you must position those things you need sooner close to the opening of the unit. This will help you in getting your stuff easily and conveniently. Be sure to choose a storage unit that will suit your storage needs and budget. Choose one that can accommodate all your things – do not hire one that is too small or too big.

, Match up the edges of the paper to ensure the fold is straight, and press down on the folded edge with your fingers to make a crease. Then, you can unfold the piece of paper, and it will have a crease in the middle.
 When the edge of the top right corner is touching the center crease in a straight line, fold the corner down. This will make a triangle shape with the top right corner.
 Fold the top left corner down as you did the right corner. Remember to smooth out the paper with your fingers to make a straight fold. You will now have two small triangles sitting on top of a rectangle.
 Both the top and bottom edges should be folded towards the center, leaving enough room in the center for a letter or card to fit, about one inch.









At this point, the paper should still be laying lengthwise
The triangular point of the paper should still be facing left.
 The edge of the folded triangle on the left-hand side of the paper should be parallel with the edge of the right hand side. The triangle itself will still be visible. Smooth out the fold with your fingers, then unfold it.
 Large cards may be too big for this method, but regular letter-sized paper will fit if folded in half or in thirds., Your note can go between the horizontal creases of the envelope. Use the bottom flaps of the triangle and the two length-wise flaps at the side to keep the message in the envelope.
 Fold the right hand edge of the paper back up to the edge of the triangle, just like did a moment ago. Fold the triangle top towards the center of the rectangle. Now, you will notice the back of your envelope looks like those bought in stores.
 Use small pieces of tape to secure the sides of the envelope. Tape the flap of the envelope closed as well.
 Unfortunately, postal services often charge more for mailpieces that are not precisely rectangular and those that do not have exact edges.Hand-deliver your homemade envelope if you do not want to pay extra shipping costs.

 There are multiple varieties of chard, but unless you want it to be bitter and tough you want young chard. Look for firm, crinkly, smaller, deep red or green leaves with no brown spots or holes. Stems should be firm, but not too thick. Smaller leaves provide a sweeter, less bitter taste.


All chard is fairly similar, but ruby and rhubarb chard generally have a stronger flavor., Even if your chard is pre-washed you should wash it again. You may want to wash it multiple times if it came from a Farmer's Market. This is easiest when done in a sink or large bowl of water., Drain the water and try to pat the chard dry.You can also dry the washed chard with a salad spinner.


It is important for the chard to be dry, especially if you sautee it!, Unless you chard has especially narrow stems and ribs (the white or red vein running through the middle) you will need to trim your chard. You can easily cut the ribs out if you fold the chard in half., While many people discard the stems and ribs, they can be used if you desire. You just need to start cooking them separately.The stems and ribs take longer to cook as they are naturally tougher and more bitter.

 It's an app that looks like gray gears and may be found on the Home Screen.;
, It's in the fifth group of menu options.
 It will turn green. Now, when you receive new emails, they will have a gray box saying "To" or "Cc" next to them.



To indicates messages where your email address appears in the "To" field.

Cc indicates an email where your email address is in the "Cc" section.
 It's the big circle button under your phone screen.



If the app doesn't open to the Mailboxes page, tap the Back button in the upper-left corner until you reach a screen with Mailboxes as its heading.
 It's at the top.
 The box will display to the left of the email's subject.


These labels will only appear under emails that the sender entered your email address manually to send. If you receive an email sent to a mailing list server (such as listserv), your emails will not have a To/CC label. However, if you are subscribed to an online mailing list (like a retailer or restaurant), you will see a "To" label next to the subject line.

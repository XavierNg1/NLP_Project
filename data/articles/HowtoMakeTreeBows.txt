 Each bow needs approximately 70cm/27.5" of ribbon length to make it a decent size. Cut as many lengths as you intend to make ribbons.


Also cut small lengths of the smaller ribbon that will tie the center of the bow together. Make as many small lengths as you are making bows.;
, Fold it into 2 loops, then pinch in the center. Check that the sides of the bow are even and voluminous. Fluff out if needed.


A fuller bow can be made using 4 or 6 loops. Increase the ribbon length if doing this.
 Glue in place for added strength.
 Check that the ends are sitting neatly and evenly. Cut each end in a "V" shape, to prevent fraying and to finish off the look.
 Slip through the middle ribbon and tie to form a hanging loop. The ribbon can now be hung on the tree.


Repeat for the amount of bows you've made.
 Either cover the whole tree in bows and leave it like that, with a star or angel at the top. Or alternate with baubles. Try to keep the bows the main feature of the tree, as this has the best effect.

For an interesting effect, make differently colored bows that complement each other. Arrange on the tree so that no two colors that are the same sit alongside each other; this will give the tree a very colorful effect.

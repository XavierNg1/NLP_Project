 There are many options for product you can use to scrunch your hair. You can use a gel, texturizing spray, sea salt spray, mousse, pomade, oil, or some other product on your hair to scrunch it. What works best for you is going to depend on your unique hair, so you should experiment with different products.


Mousse holds hair in place lightly and adds volume.Gel is good for thick hair and has a stronger hold than mousse.Sea salt spray is good for flat or thin hair and helps keep your hair from drying out., Put a small amount of the product into your hands and rub them together. Grab the ends of your hair and “scrunch,” as if you were crumpling a piece of paper. Do this all around your head on all the ends and work your way up (but don’t apply product to your scalp).


To create extra volume, scrunch with your head upside down.
Only use a small amount of product, otherwise your hair might look hard when it is dry., You can let your hair air dry or you can use a finger diffuser to dry your hair. Use the blow dryer with a diffuser attachment while you scrunch. Direct the blow dryer up the strands, toward the section of hair that is being scrunched.

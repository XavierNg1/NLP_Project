 All types of animals, from birds to deer to insects, have lost some of their habitat to human developments. You've probably seen birds bathing in oil-tainted water and deer wandering through suburbs because they have nowhere else to go. If you have the space, try to be welcoming to animals who could use a helping hand. You can make your property hospitable in the following ways:


Plant shrubs, flowers and trees that attract wildlife.
Put out a bird feeder and bird bath stocked with clean food and water.
Let beneficial snakes, spiders, bees, bats, and other creatures live. Having these animals around is a sign your ecosystem is in good health.
Install a beehive if you have the room.
Use cedar chips or aromatic herbs instead of mothballs.
Don't use chemical pesticides.
Use humane traps instead of rat and mouse poisons and insect killers.
Use an electric or manual lawnmower instead of a gas-powered one.
 The oceans are being depleted of large fish populations due to overfishing and pollution. Up to 90 percent of the ocean's large fish are now gone.You can do your part to protect marine life by only eating fish that is in season and caught using sustainable practices.
 Many animals that are thought of as pests are not causing real harm. Other animals that live in wild places aren't usually in human view, so we tend to forget about their needs. With dozens of animal species going extinct every day,they need all they help they can get. Try being more mindful in the following ways:


Let creatures like moles, groundhogs, and squirrels live instead of trapping and killing them. They may cause a little inconvenience in your garden, but they have a part to play in your region's ecosystem.
Don't disturb wild places like forests, beaches, wetlands and other areas where animals make their homes. When you visit such areas, stay on trails so you don't accidentally cause damage to an animal's habitat.

 Make note of the shape and size of the chest you want to build. Include the hardware and a cutting list for the parts to the toy chest on the sketch.;
,

The materials list will be 3/4-inch (19 mm) MDF or plywood, applicable hinges, and (if using MDF #8 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) MDF) torx flat head screws or (for plywood) 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) deck screws.






Have the home improvement store use their panel saw to cut the sheet down to the approximate sizes you need for the top, bottom, front, back and ends.
,


This will be 2 pieces of 18 x 36 inches (45.7 x 91.44 cm) for the front and back.






You need 1 piece of 16.5 x 34.5 inches (41.9 x 87.6 cm) for the bottom.






A single piece of 19 x 37 inches (48.3 x 94 cm) will be for the top.






The ends will be made from 2 pieces cut to 17.25 X 16.5 inches (44.5 X 41.9 cm).






Mark the pieces lightly with a pencil as you cut them to show where each part goes.

Fill all the countersunk screw holes and joints with paintable wood putty.






Sand down the toy box after drying, readying it for paint.
 Start with 120 grit and finish with 240 grit sandpaper.
 Follow manufacturer's recommendations.



Make certain the hinge is flush to the back of the box.
It also needs to be centered so that it is 1/2 inch (13 mm) off each side of the box, corresponding to the each end of the top.
An easy way to center the hinge is to mark the center of the hinge on top and back of the box. The center would be 15 inches for a 30-inch (76.2 cm) piano hinge. Then mark the center on the lid and back of the box. Align the marks and attach the hinge.
This should give you a 1-inch (26 cm) lip at the front to make it easy to open.

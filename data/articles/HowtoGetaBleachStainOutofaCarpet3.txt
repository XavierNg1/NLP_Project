 Dish soap and vinegar should both be safe to use on a bleach stain, but even so, read the bleach's directions and warnings before using those or any other product on the stain. Many include lists of chemicals that should never be mixed with bleach, like ammonia, which can cause a toxic reaction. Double-check the ingredients of any cleaning or repair product that you intend to use to make sure it doesn't include any of those ingredients.
 Keep in mind that bleach can harm your skin. Always wear protective gloves before trying to wash bleach out of your carpet by hand. Do so even if the bleach has dried, since the chemicals are still present even though the moisture isn't., Fumes from bleach can be overpowering, causing lightheadedness, nausea, and other ailments. If you're using vinegar to clean it up, expect the combined smell to be even more overwhelming. Open some windows and/or set up some fans to draw the fumes away from you while you work on the stain.

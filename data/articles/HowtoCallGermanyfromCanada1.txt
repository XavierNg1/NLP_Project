 These can be found at your local supermarket or mall. You can choose one specific to Germany or a general worldwide card.


Check to make sure you can call to Germany with the card you buy. Also look at the fees; you want to be sure you are getting as many minutes as advertised. Most cards have expiration dates; check that yours is reasonable.The FCC notes that some calling card companies are dishonest; some advertise a certain number of minutes for a specified price and then slap you with fees that use up some of that cost, so you actually receive fewer minutes than advertised.;
, Generally, you call a toll-free phone number and enter the pin number from the card you bought., The number "011" is the exit code for the U.S. and Canada, while "49" is the country entrance code for Germany., Once you dial, you should be able to talk to someone in Germany.
 These cards offer you a certain number of minutes per card. Watch how long you are talking, so you don't run out while talking.
 Some cards let you reload the card by calling in and adding minutes to it with a credit card.

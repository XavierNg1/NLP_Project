 Make sure your shampoo is sulfate-free and silicone-free, because sulfates can dry out curly hair even more, and silicones can build-up on curly hair. Silicones are okay for your hair as long as you use a shampoo with Cocoamidopropyl Betaine or coco-betaine, and that the shampoo does not actually contain silicones.
 It is important to avoid overwashing your hair to preserve your hair's natural oils. When you do wash your hair:


Massage the shampoo into your scalp and let the suds run down to your ends.
Put conditioner in at the midpoint of your locks and work it down to the ends. Comb it in with a wide-toothed comb, if necessary. Scrunch your hair to help define the curls.
Rinse your hair with warm or cool water to keep it from drying out.
 Use a 100% cotton t-shirt, microfiber towel, or even paper towels to dry your hair. Avoid rubbing your wet hair with a towel.
 Then, apply a monthly hot oil treatment to give your locks a glossy shine.
 Brushing will break your hair cuticles and cause frizz. Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to pull out tangles.
 Style your hair when it's wet and try not to touch or scrunch it while it air dries.
 Sprays that contain sea salt are great for defining curls, but make sure it also contains conditioning ingredients, as sea salt can dry your hair.
 If you have to, then braid or plait it in three or more sections. Also, sleep on a satin or silk pillowcase or head scarf to minimize frizz.

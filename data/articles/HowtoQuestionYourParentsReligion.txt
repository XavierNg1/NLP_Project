 There are many feeling when it comes to religions. Some people can preach it to the whole universe with pride while others wish to practice in private and in peace. With these different feelings, it's necessary to put it into consideration. Usually, it is appropriate to ask your parents personal questions when it's just them and you. It's better if they're in a good mood.;
, Weird as it may seem, any question can set off a good conversation. If your not sure what to ask, consider the following.


"Mom, Dad, what religion do you guys believe in?"
"What does the religion believe in exactly?"
" Is it part of our heritage? The ____ religion?"
"Are there certain rules to this religion?"
"What do you guys love the most about the religion?"

, When they respond, you should sit and listen to their reasoning. Be open minded when they do this, it could be quite personal for them to explain their beliefs to you. If you do not agree with some of their beliefs, simply keep that part to yourself. Do no interrupt as they explain to you.
 If you are still unsure of their religion, keep asking questions. It's important to notice their mood when you continue the conversation. If they seem annoyed that you keep asking, simply allow the subject to die and depart from the conversation. If they ask you why you were curious, tell them their feelings.
 If they respond angrily, apologize immediately and depart. Sometimes when people question religion, it can offend the people of the faith. Or sometimes the way you ask can offend the person, so remember to choose your words and tone of voice wisely.

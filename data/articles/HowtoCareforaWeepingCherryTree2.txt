 Do not give it fertilizer during the first year after it has been planted. Wait until the second year. Giving it fertilizer at this time will cause it to grow too quickly which will stress and damage the roots., Use fertilizer with a 10-10-10 (Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potash or N-P-K) ratio and sprinkle it evenly over the soil. Usually, 1/4 to 1/2 cup of fertilizer is plenty but this varies.


Follow the fertilizer manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
 The fertilizer should be spread from a few inches away from the trunk to 3 feet beyond the edge of the branches all the way around the tree. Water the tree generously after spreading the fertilizer to wash it down into the soil.
 A well-fertilized weeping cherry tree will grow vigorously and bloom profusely. If the tree seems to be growing slowly, give it another dose of fertilizer toward the end of spring.


Do not give your tree fertilizer after mid-summer as it will encourage new, lush growth that may not mature before winter. Immature or unhardened branch growth could be damaged by winter weather.
 Weeping cherry trees do not always need to be pruned but, if the branches are looking a bit scraggly and you would like to neaten them up, they can be pruned right after they finish flowering, in the winter or in early spring., Make the pruning cut 1/8- to 1/4-inch above a leaf. New branches will grow from the area right below where the pruning cut was made.

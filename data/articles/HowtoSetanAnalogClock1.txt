 If you have to reset your clock, itâ€™s likely that you need a new battery before doing so. Your batteries are usually found in a small box on the back of the clock. If there is no battery box on the back of the clock, a small rectangular hole in an indented rectangle is a good sign of a battery pack.


If there is no battery inside your clock, most battery packs have embossed letters inside the battery spaces telling you what size batteries to get.;
, Dials are usually located at the back of the clock. Sometimes you may have to remove a battery cover in order to get access to the dials on your clock.


If your clock has an alarm or a calendar, you may find that it has many dials. Your dials may have arrows or diagrams next to them that indicate their function.
 You can figure out how the dials work by experimenting. Turn the dials, and then see what happens on the face of the clock.


You should choose a dial and put your fingers on it firmly. Then turn the clock around so that you can see the hands moving, and turn the dial to figure out which hand it is connected to. There are a number of variables that can affect the function of the dials, so try to experiment: turn them both directions, and lift them or pull them out to see if this changes which hand engages.
Some clocks will use one dial for each hand. Other clocks will have one dial that moves both hands. There may also be a dial to set an alarm, which is usually a smaller hand that is a different color than the other ones.
 Check a phone or computer to find the current time. News and weather channels often display the time as well.

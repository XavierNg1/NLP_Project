 First, turn your oven up to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). While that preheats, poke each potato a few times with a fork. Place them in the microwave and cook on high for about ten to twelve minutes to soften them., Transfer them to a cutting board once they’ve softened. Cut each one in half lengthwise. Use a spoon to carve out the inside. Leave roughly a ¼-inch (0.6 cm) of flesh inside each skin., Add the oil to a large pot on the stovetop. Turn the heat to medium-high and test with a deep-frying thermometer. Once it reaches 365 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius), put the potato skins in the oil and fry for five minutes. Then use a metal slotted spoon to scoop them out and place them on some paper towels so the excess oil can drain., Grease the inside of a baking pan. Place the potato skins inside. Stuff them with your cheese and bacon bits. Then stick them in the oven and bake for roughly seven minutes to melt the cheese. Top with sour cream and serve.

 Before you start cleaning, you’ll want to make sure that there’s no power going to the razor. Slide or press the power button to the “off” position and look for the power indicator display to go dark.It may be a good idea to unplug the razor entirely. You don’t want to accidentally switch it on while you’re trying to clean it!;
, The cutting head is the part of the razor that comes into contact with your face while shaving. This can usually be detached by simply pulling it straight off the frame, or by pressing a small latch on the front or back of the head. You’ll likely notice a lot of hair, skin particles and dust built up on both the inside and outside of the cutting head.Give the detached cutting head a light tap against the edge of your sink to remove hair clippings that have compacted inside. Just be careful not to damage the delicate blades or cutting foils, as these can easily be warped out of shape., Use a stiff-bristled brush to remove whatever loose matter is clinging to the cutting head. Most electric razors include a small brush specifically designed for light cleaning. If your razor didn’t come with such a brush, a cheap nail brush from your local pharmacy will also do the trick.Use smooth sweeping motions to dislodge debris without applying too much force to the cutting surface.If the cutting head of your razor is washable, run it under the faucet and dry it gently with a towel.
 Once you’ve brushed off as much debris as you can, snap the cutting head back into place on the end of the razor’s frame. Listen for it to click so you’ll know it’s secure. You can now return to using the razor as normal.

Make an effort to brush your razor’s cutting head clean each and every time you shave.

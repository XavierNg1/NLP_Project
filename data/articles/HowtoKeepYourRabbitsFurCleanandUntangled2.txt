 You may not be able to remove dried-on messes, like mud or your rabbit’s droppings, by spot-cleaning with a baby wipe. Giving your rabbit a dry bath can help take care of these stubborn, dried-on messes. The first step in giving your rabbit a dry bath is to sprinkle baby cornstarch powder liberally over these areas.Do not use a baby powder that contains talc, or talcum powder. This can be harmful to rabbits., Use your fingers to work the powder around the soiled area, into the fur and down to the skin. Coating these messes with powder should allow them to break free from the fur and slide off.
 Use your fingers to gently pull down on the dried debris, removing it from your rabbit’s coat. Rabbit skin is surprisingly delicate, so keep your hand pressed against your rabbit’s skin at the top of the soiled area to keep from tearing it.


For especially stubborn messes, use a fine-toothed comb to gently work the debris out of the fur after you’ve applied the cornstarch powder. To do so, start at the top of the stain (closest to the skin) and lightly tease the dirt away from the skin. Place your hand on your rabbit’s skin to keep from pulling too hard., Use your hand to pat down the powdered areas to remove any remaining cornstarch. In addition, use a hand-held vacuum to vacuum the air around your bunny to remove any powder from the air and keep your bunny from ingesting it.You can also use a soft wash cloth or microfiber cloth to clean any remaining powder from your rabbit.

 You can use more hydrator if you have a lot of dry skin, but be sure not to over-saturate your skin, as this can clog your pores., Donâ€™t rub it in too hard, as this can irritate your skin. Instead, dab it on and then pat lightly to distribute the hydrator on your face.Also, be careful to distribute the hydrator evenly instead of starting at the middle and pushing outward, which can lead to an over-accumulation of moisturizer, and thus clogged pores, around the perimeter of your face., Do not wash hydrator off your face, and be sure it is completely dry before you add any makeup or sunscreen.
 It should be used in conjunction with Skin-Smoothing Exfoliator and Pore-Targeting Treatment every morning and evening. In addition, you can use the hydrator throughout the day to treat dry skin as needed.

 Take the left fork road to the Goblin Village (the right fork will lead you up the mountain).;
, You'll then get into the middle of an argument about armor colors. Ask them if you can suggest a color for them. You will be asked to get an orange, blue, and brown mail.
 Search the crates in the Goblin Village for the brown one.
 Ask Wyson, the head gardener, if you can buy woad leaves. Get two leaves from him.
 There is some bushes nearby; pick three red berries off from a bush.
 Stop by the sheep pen in Lumbridge and you'll see an onion patch. Pick two onions.
 Ask Aggie (the witch) if she can make you anything you need. Select the option of dyes. You'll need to pick all three, red, yellow, and blue. As she is making the dyes, the items will disappear from your inventory and little bottles of dye will appear.



Combine the red and yellow dye to make orange. Use the orange and blue dye on the goblin mails. You'll end up with a brown, orange, and blue one in your inventory.
 Talk to the general again. They'll ask for the orange one. They won't like it. They'll ask for the blue one, as they won't like it either. Give them the brown goblin mail and they'll be happy. At the end of the quest you get some money 500-1000gp and one gold bar. (The bar sells for about 400gp.)

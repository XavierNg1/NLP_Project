 Be sure to search for competitive local rates. Also, keep in mind that you have to transport the car to the salvage yard somehow, so closer is usually better.
 Some yards only deal in specific materials, or have certain materials that they do not accept. Make sure ahead of time that the salvage yard you choose will take your car. Also, be ask if you need to remove any specific parts or fluids from your car., Usually, the cheapest way to transport a vehicle to the scrap yard is to drive it there. This isn’t always possible, so some salvage yards will come pick up your vehicle for an extra charge.If that isn’t an option either, you will have to arrange to have your car towed to the salvage yard.
 This is usually just a title, but be sure to call the salvage yard ahead of time and make sure that they do not need anything else. If you do not have all of the needed paperwork, the yard will not accept your vehicle.

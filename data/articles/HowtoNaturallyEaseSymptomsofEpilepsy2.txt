 Some seizures can be controlled with special diets, but these should only be used while working with a nutritionist. Discuss taking mineral and vitamin supplements with your neurologist and nutritionist, especially if you are taking antiepilepsy medications, which may deplete specific nutrients, particularly those needed for bone and heart health., This diet entails eating primarily high-fat foods and very few carbohydrates. The diet must also be carefully calculated and monitored, which requires initial fasting and a hospital stay for observation.The diet is often used to help treat childhood epilepsy.Allowed calories, fluids, and proteins are calculated based on the current weight of the patient and a meal plan can be developed based on the specific form of epilepsy and the age of the child.


This diet pushes the body to use fats (instead of carbs) as its main energy source.
Potential long-term effects of the diet include kidney stones, high cholesterol, slowed growth, and weight gain.This is why it is important to work closely with your doctor and nutritionist while on this diet.
 The modified Atkins diet has been shown in recent studies to reduce the rate of seizures in almost half of all adults that try it.It is also a low-carb, high-fat diet, but it is tailored to adults and requires no fasting, calorie counting, or hospital stays like the ketogenic diet.However, intake is still based on your weight and other factors, so you must consult a nutritionist.


The diet was developed at Johns Hopkins in 2002 with the specific purpose of helping to treat epilepsy.Those who switch to the diet typically see results within a few months.Recommended fats include bacon, eggs, mayonnaise, butter, hamburger, heavy whipping cream, and oils such as canola and olive oils. Carbohydrates are restricted (10-20g/day), though not as severely as they are with the ketogenic diet.
 Zinc tends to be deficient in those suffering from epilepsy.Hence, it would be helpful to include foods rich in zinc to your diet, namely nuts, legumes, and seafood.

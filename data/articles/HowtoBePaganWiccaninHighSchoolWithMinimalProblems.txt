 Don't force your beliefs down others' throats. It won't make you friends, and it will make things all that much harder on you.;
, No matter how many times you're picked on or made fun of, never threaten to cast a spell on the offenders and especially never actually do it. Fear from misunderstanding is common, and the best thing you can do if those sort of people won't let themselves be taught about your faith is to stay away from them.

If you are worried about wearing a pentacle, keep it small or under your shirt. Don't forget you can wear other, less known symbols, like a simple star.
 They aren't going to listen to you if you fight with them.
 If someone invites you to go to youth group with them, consider going.


Consider inviting them to an open ritual or simply to a celebration of a Sabbat or Esbat (if you celebrate them) after your personal rituals. Try not to be offended if they are not open minded about it. (Never invite an outsider to a meeting of a coven without previous permission from the circle.)
If you are being bullied or threatened, do not be afraid to go to counselors or teachers for help. It may end up with you being outed by parents or friends (which isn't the end of the world), but your personal safety should always be your biggest concern. Most counselors need your permission before parents are consulted anyway, and they can see to it that the problems end. Never let the problem continue to escalate until you are actually hurt.

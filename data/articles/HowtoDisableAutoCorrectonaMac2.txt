 You can find this by going to "System Preferences" under the apple icon.
 From the "Keyboard" window, select the "Text" tab in order to disable autocorrect for single instances of words. Two columns will display the built-in auto corrected words.
 In the lower left-hand corner of the screen, select the "+" button. This will highlight a row in one of the columns where you can type the word that is being auto-corrected. For example, if the word that is being auto corrected is a name like "Jon" and it is being auto-corrected to "John," type "Jon" in this space. Make sure not to add any punctuation marks or spaces.
 This is the column where you will enter what you want autocorrect to change it to. In the instance of disabling autocorrect, you will want to enter exactly when you entered in the "Replace" column. For example, both columns should now read "Jon." Make sure not to add any punctuation marks or spaces.
 Once you have entered the replacement text and the "With" entry, you are done and the autocorrect should no longer be an issue.

 The chair should have an armrest to support the patient's arm but should not have wheels. Make sure that the patient's arm is not bent at the elbow. If the patient is lying down, place a pillow under the patient's arm for additional support.
 Tie a tourniquet around the patient's arm about 3" to 4" (7.5cm to 10 cm) above the venipuncture site.
 Avoid asking the patient to pump his or her fist.
 Tap the vein with your index finger to encourage dilation.
 Use a circular motion, and avoid dragging the wipe over the same piece of skin twice.

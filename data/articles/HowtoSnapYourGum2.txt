 Flatten the gum into a disk, just like you would in the normal snap method. Stick your tongue through the disk without breaking it, then withdraw your tongue and clamp the edges together to make a a sealed air bubble. Chew to pop this bubble and make a snapping noise.


Blowing into the bubble as you pull out your tongue might help., Some people find it faster to fold the gum in half instead. Bring one end over to the other, sealing the sides and ends with your teeth and the sides of your mouth. If you manage to do this correctly, you'll end up with a "dumpling" of air, which pops just like an ordinary bubble.
 If you want to snap gum many times as you chew, you'll have to practice one of the two steps above until you can do it rapidly or even unconsciously. Once you learn these larger motions, you can try making the bubbles smaller and smaller, until you can form them just by folding the gum over and chewing. Chewing too hard or too soft will prevent the bubbles from forming and making noise, so it takes quite a bit of practice before you can get a steady stream of snaps.

 Even if therapy is helping you, you may have times when you do not want to go. This is normal, but it is important to consider why you don’t want to go so that you can talk to your therapist about it. Some questions you might ask yourself include:When did you start feeling this way? Can you connect it with a specific session?
Do you ever feel uncomfortable talking with your therapist or during your appointments?
If you are on medication, do you think it is affecting the way you feel in negative ways?

, Sometimes therapy may get tough and you may not feel like going to an appointment or at all. If this happens, then it is important to talk to your therapist about how you are feeling.Call your therapist or talk to him or her in person. Try saying something like, “I have been feeling like quitting therapy because I was bothered by ___ after our session last week.”
Don’t abruptly stop going to therapy if you don’t feel like going. Make sure that you talk to your counselor before you make any decisions.
 If there is something changeable about going to therapy that is causing problems for you, then you might need to change something to continue with your stress management counseling. This might be something simple that would be easy to change.For example, if the time of day is bad for you, ask your counselor about meeting at a different time. If the fees are too expensive, ask your counselor if he or she offers a sliding fee scale.
 It is important to feel comfortable with your therapist. If you are not feeling comfortable with your counselor, then you can always look for a new counselor.Although it might be a little uncomfortable to end your relationship with a therapist, being honest about your feelings is important. Try saying something like, “I appreciate the help you have given me, but I think I am going to start working with a different therapist.”

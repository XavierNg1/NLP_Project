 You will be boiling these together to prepare simple syrup. This extra step will give you a smoother limeade, and prevent those annoying grains of un-dissolved sugar from appearing at the bottom.


For a less-sweet limeade, use Â¾ cups (170 grams) of sugar.
 This is not essential to the recipe, but it will give your limeade a more complex flavor. You will need about 1 lime to do this. It might be a good idea to zest the limes before you cut and juice it.


For a twist, swap out the lime zest for 2 tablespoons of minced, fresh ginger., While the mixture is coming to a boil, be sure to stir it well so that the sugar dissolves., Make sure that the pitcher is large enough to hold the rest of your ingredients.
 Roll the limes across the counter while pressing down on them with your palm. Slice them in half, then juice them. You will need 1 cup (240 milliliters) of lime juice.
 Stir everything well with a long-handled spoon until the simple syrup, lime juice, and water are completely combined. You should not see any simple syrup gathered at the bottom of the pitcher.
 Everyone has different tastes, so you may need to adjust the limeade to suit yours. If the limeade is too sweet for you, add a little bit more lime juice. If it is too strong, then add some more water. If it is too sour, then add some more sugar. Be sure to stir the limeade well after each addition that you make.
 You can garnish it with some lime slices or fresh mint leaves for a fancier touch. It will taste even better with ice, but instead of adding ice straight into the pitcher, consider putting the ice into the glasses instead. If you add ice into the pitcher, the ice will dilute the limeade as it melts.

 Set out four juice glasses and spoon two tablespoons of vanilla yogurt into the bottom of each one. Use low-fat or non-fat yogurt – whichever you prefer.

Feel free to experiment with other yogurt flavors. Strawberry and coconut yogurt would both be excellent tropical-themed yogurt alternatives.
 Open the canned mandarin slices and drain away the juice/syrup. Evenly divide the slices between the four glasses and layer them on top of the yogurt., Measure out 1 ½ tablespoons of the breakfast cereal and sprinkle it on top of the oranges in each glass. Spoon two more tablespoons of yogurt over the cereal layer.

This recipe calls crisped rice cereal, but you can experiment with your favorite cereals and granola.
 Cut the base off the pineapple, then cut away the peel. Slice the pineapple away from the core and dice them into bite-sized chunks. Layer ¼ cup of pineapple into each glass.

If fresh pineapple isn’t available, use canned pineapple packed in its own juice.
 Top it all off with 1 ½ tablespoons of breakfast cereal. Serve immediately.

Try additional toppings like dried coconut flakes, macadamia nuts, sliced almonds and dried cranberries.

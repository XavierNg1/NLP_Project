 Many dolls come with a name, but if you don't like it, you don't have to use it. Use your imagination!


If you like two names, put them together or use one as a middle name. For example: Ella-Jade Northman or Ella Jade Northman. Either way works.
Some possible names include:

Flower names, like Lily, Rose, Daisy, Violet, or Poppy.
Names of your favorite characters, like Ariel, Jasmine, Pip or Elsa.
Something that rhymes with your name, like Bailey (if your name is Hailey), Angeline (if your name is Christine), or Flora (if your name is Laura).
Something with the same first letter as your name, like Kayla (if your name is Kristen), Monica (if your name is Mary), or Ivy (if your name is Isabelle).

, You could also try making your own. See How to Make Clothes for Your Doll.
 Don't forget about lunch! This is very important, or you will end up with a very hungry dolly!

, Dolls love playing with toys, so share with them as you would share with any of your friends.
 Your doll might be very shy and scared about being in a new place, so make sure you sleep with her/him or put their bed next to yours. Sing them lullabies, read them their favorite book, and tuck them up. Never forget to give them a kiss and cuddle, or they will feel very sad and lonely, even if it's only for one night!

, If you are going on a long trip or on holidays, make sure you have everything your doll will need, especially clothes and food.
 Dolls love to have friends. So if your friends have dolls, pretend the dolls are chatting (or baby talking) and set up a Play Date. This is very cute and fun!

, Everyone gets sick or injured sometimes. Try to make your doll feel better. You could pretend to take them to the doctor, or even be their doctor! If you are their doctor, they will feel more comfortable; they trust you more than anyone. Be as gentle as you can if you need to play doll hospital.

 Learn to distinguish between real problems and minor issues you can ignore. If your spouse has a few habits that are annoying but harmless, reconsider whether you really need to argue about them.For example, if your husband likes to move some pillows to a different chair when he comes home from work, don’t nag him over it. Putting the pillows back is easier than fighting.
 Focus on your spouse’s good traits, both big and small, and don’t be shy about giving them a sincere compliment every now and then. When your spouse does something thoughtful for you, thank them.For example, you could say something like, “Thanks so much for making dinner when I get home late. That makes my evenings a lot more relaxing.”

, No one is perfect, and your spouse will make mistakes just like anyone else. You wouldn’t like it if someone held your past mistakes against you, so don’t hold your spouse’s slip-ups against them, either., Don’t let months or years of marriage make you lose sight of the reasons you married your spouse. Make a habit of going on dates, trying new things, and having fun together. Choose activities you both like, such as taking a stroll to enjoy the weather or working on a hobby you share., Don’t listen to friends or family members who offer you bad advice or try to influence you for the worse. If someone tries to meddle in your marriage, tell them politely but firmly that your relationships are your own business., Choose happiness over being right. We all want to win arguments, but needing to defeat the other person all the time will destroy your relationship. If you’re arguing about something trivial, or if you think you really might be wrong, let your spouse win the argument.

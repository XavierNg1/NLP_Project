 The magazine release is a button that releases the magazine clip that holds the stapler.The button is generally found at the rear of the magazine itself and may require pushing or pulling to depress.If you don’t know where your magazine is located, look at where the staples come out of the gun. Make sure the stapler gun is unplugged or off before pressing the magazine release. The release button should be on the opposite side of where the staples are fired.;
, After depressing the release button, you will be able to slide the magazine out of the gun.From here, you will need to turn the stapler upside down to insert the staples., While the gun is upside down, insert the staples leg first. They will go in towards the nose of the stapler, followed by the butt.Slide the magazine back in until you hear the “click” notifying you that the magazine has clipped into place., Plug your electric stapler back into the wall and give it a try. Ensure the staples are coming out one at a time. Be cautious of any kickback if this is your first time using this type stapler.


Test the stapler gun by stapling into a scrap piece of wood. Try to use a piece that is as close to the thickness of the actual items that you are stapling together or are made from the same material. For example, if you are stapling into particle board, use scrap pieces of particle board to test the stapler.

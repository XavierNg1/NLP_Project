 If he notices you his in more likely to get talking to you.;
, Don't be one of the guys - make sure you stand out. Ask him questions, but make sure not to offend him. Compliment him.
 If you are thinking of asking him out, don't make him hate you before you get the chance or he might think you're joking when you ask him, and he certainly won't say yes.
 Keep your conversations interesting. Sometimes they can be funny, sometimes they can be more meaningful, but don't get too heavy.
 Make sure you are not shaky or nervous or the guy will think you are so uncool.
 If you want to ask him out, do so.
 He will be more likely to say no to your question if you say it in front of his friends.
 Use phrases such as 'Can I talk to you, please, in . . . private.' or flatter him, 'Your hair looks so handsome' 'Your outfit is really cool', etc. Make sure to be genuine though!

, Remember to answer all the questions in time.
 Don't just blurt out 'will you go out with me?!'.
 You might feel sad, but don't let it ruin your friendship; show him there are no hard feelings by hugging him and smiling, and make sure you continue to talk to him.
 This will make him think he is off out with a loony.
 He is going out with you because he likes you, so don't change drastically, and don't be fake. Never try too hard; you will just seem desperate.

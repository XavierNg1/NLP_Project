 Just before the interview starts, use a strong breath mint or strip. It's important to get rid of any traces of alcohol in your breath, which might still be lingering in your lungs.


Don't take a mint that you'll still be chewing on during the interview. Strips are better as they will dissolve quickly.
 This means that you'll need to try extra hard to stay focused and to really listen to the questions.


If you need to pause to recompose yourself at any stage, do so; this is far better than regurgitating a lot of nonsense just to fill the gap. People will respect a thoughtful pause and consider that you're taking the matter seriously (which you are, of course).
 Pick a spot in the room behind the interviewer's head that you can use to keep refocusing your attention on.


Even if it's blurry, it'll be a safety spot for you to return to, making it appear as if you're focused on the interviewer without having to actually maintain complete direct eye contact all the time.
 Fidgeting comes from nerves, boredom and wanting to be distracted (or somewhere else). Unfortunately, if you're experiencing a hangover, you may just be feeling all three things and be tempted to fidget to overcome the desire to leave or fall asleep.


Do something to keep yourself focused and alert, such as pinching the palm of your hand regularly or knocking your knees together gently (choose a focusing technique that doesn't look obvious to the interviewers or they'll be worried about your sanity).
 Taking deep breaths during the interview will not only help you relax, but it'll also ensure that your blood is getting enough oxygen and make you feel a little bit more fresh and alert. Sit up straight, and avoid sighing when you exhale.

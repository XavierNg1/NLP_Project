 When you are talking to your crush, do not shout. This will not help them understand you better, and if they are reading lips it may even make it harder to understand you. If they don’t understand what you said, repeat yourself clearly in a normal tone of voice. You also may talk a little slower if you are a fast talker, but not in an exaggeratedly slow way., Don’t try to make up sign language. Languages like ASL are extremely sophisticated and complex, so doing hand motions and throwing in a couple real words will make you look extremely ignorant. It’s ok if you don’t know sign language! Your crush won’t hold it against you., Don’t go out of your way to avoid mentioning their deafness. Your crush’s deafness is a part of them just like their gender or their age.Treating deafness like a sad or taboo subject might mean that you are not comfortable with their deafness. If this is true, you may want to reconsider whether you are ready to date them.
 Never apologize for your crush’s deafness or say things like, “I’m sorry that you’re deaf”, or “You must be sad that you can’t hear things.” Many deaf people are proud to be deaf and don’t want to be “cured”. Being deaf is part of their identity and the deaf community is a strong and vibrant community to be a part of., If your crush didn’t understand what you said, always repeat yourself, even if it’s an unimportant comment. Don’t say “never mind” or “it’s not important.” This will make your crush feel excluded and snubbed.You don’t have to change what words you used or “dumb it down”. In fact, repeating the same thing over again is preferable.
 When you’re with your crush, don’t order for them at restaurants or tell others what they want. Doing this makes it seem like you don’t think your crush is capable of taking care of themselves, and it can come across as inconsiderate or even insulting. Unless your crush asks you to, don’t speak for them.

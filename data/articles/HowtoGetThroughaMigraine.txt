At least one study has found that a higher than normal dose of aspirin is nearly as effective as prescription migraine drugs. Common over-the-counter medicines include Motrin, Tylenol, Aleve, and Excedrin Tension Headaches.Some pain relievers have specific combinations that are helpful for severe migraines. Excedrin has many different types of medication that combine multiple relievers that may help.

If this is the case, avoid taking these drugs unless absolutely necessary.


Vomiting, or just hard dry heaving, can often bring a migraine to a climax after which the discomfort subsides.
 Migraine can be triggered by dehydration. Once a migraine starts, try to drink some water to see if it helps ease the symptoms. Dehydration can get worse if you are vomiting or have diarrhea, so make sure you are replacing any fluids lost. Stay away from other drinks that might cause your symptoms to get worse. You can try a sports drink because they help you replace electrolytes., Once a migraine starts, apply an ice pack to the painful area for 15 â€“ 20 minutes. This can help numb the painful areas.

For most people, that means around eight hours of sleep a night. If you're having trouble falling asleep, try to be sure to wind down hours before bedtime.

 Exercise can lessen the pain of a migraine and also lessen the frequency of migraines in general. A recent study has shown that 40 minutes of cardio exercise, three times a week is just as effective as medicine and relaxation techniques in helping prevent the onset of migraines. However, migraines can be triggered by exercise if you're not used to it. Start with light exercise and exercise regularly. Once your body is accustomed to it, you can use a light walk or jog to relieve your pain and even prevent pain in the future., If you regularly consume caffeine, your habit could be causing your problem.

This renders the patient susceptible to headache if caffeine dosing is delayed, and caffeine then relieves migraine by reversing caffeine withdrawal.

The logical strategy is to assume caffeine is the likely culprit, and to wean yourself from caffeine., Study which foods may be triggering your migraines. In some cases, migraines have be reduced 30 â€“ 50% by removing all triggers from the diet. You should try to identify a migraine-trigger food before you eat it. Find out triggers, which include chocolate, cheese, alcohol, and citrus fruits, if you know the trigger, avoid that food, drink or element.If you aren't sure if food is triggering you, keep a food diary and note when you have a migraine. See if any patterns arise.
 Fluorescent lights are a possible trigger. Test you sensitivity to the light by avoiding them for several days and then exposing yourself to them again. If you notice that you develop nausea or anxiety within a short time of exposure, or if you develop full migraine symptoms within hours, light is a trigger for you.
 A headache diary can help you identify potential triggers. It can also help you assess the effectiveness of different treatments. Start a diary and write down the foods you eat, when you have a migraine, where you were when it occurred, what you did or took for relief, and how long the migraine lasted. This will help you track your migraines and help yourself find a path to relief.

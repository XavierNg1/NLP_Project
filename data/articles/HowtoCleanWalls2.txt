 It is recommended that you always test an inconspicuous area of the wall before cleaning the stain off, to check that the product you're using won't lift the paintwork.
 For most painted walls, it will be sufficient to use warm, soapy water. Or, use a cup of distilled white vinegar in one bucket of warm water if you want something with slightly more strength. Vinegar won't leave any residue, so there's no need to rinse.Prepare two buckets for comprehensive wall cleaning. One bucket is for the cleaning solution, and the other is water, in order to rinse the wall about 5 minutes after the solution has been applied. Change the rinse water when it is looking dirty.
Avoid the use of proprietary products that contain alcohol for wall cleaning. Such products risk breaking down the paint surface and this will leave a bright and shiny mark in its place.
 To do this, simply add Â½ cup of baking soda to a gallon-sized bucket of warm water. Spray this mixture onto a soft towel and wipe over the stains or sticky spots. Rinse with water and wipe dry with a separate towel.

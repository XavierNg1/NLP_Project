Backing up the iPod is a relatively quick process, depending on how much information you have. If you want to reset your iPod, don't backup., Tap Settings → General → Passcode Lock → Turn Passcode Lock Off. The passcode can interfere with the jailbreak process., This is the jailbreak software that allows you to jailbreak iOS 7.0-7.0.6. Make sure to download the software from evasi0n.com., Ensure that your iPod is showing up in the evasi0n window, and then click Jailbreak., Most of the process is automated. Follow any prompts that appear in the evasi0n7 window., Once the jailbreak is complete, launch the Cydia app on your Home screen to finish setting up the new file system. Your iPod will restart., After resetting, open Cydia one last time to finish the setup process. Once the "Reloading Data" box appears and then disappears, you're good to go.

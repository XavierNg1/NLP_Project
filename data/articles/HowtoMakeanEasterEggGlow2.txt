 Tie each glow stick into a knot or pretzel shape so it will fit easily into the plastic egg.


Glow sticks can be obtained - very cost effectively - at art, party, and some grocery/one-stop-shopping stores.
The average glow stick lasts six to eight hours, so don't activate them too long before your intended egg hunt. ,, Let the glow-in-the-dark Easter egg hunt begin!

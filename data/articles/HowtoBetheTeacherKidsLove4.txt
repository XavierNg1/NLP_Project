 Animals are awesome, and they can teach students a large number of different skills and abilities. Depending on the age and type of classroom you have, consider adding one or more pet to the classroom. Use that pet as a way to teach your students responsibility and other important life skills., Every so often, maybe once a week at a certain time, allow your students to decide what they want to do or learn. Maybe this time is a special play time where your students get to pick what game they want to play. Divide the decision making between different students or groups. Allow your students to become part of the teaching process.This might also be a great opportunity to have your students present to the class, instead of you. Make it an assignment that each student, or group of students, has to present a topic of their choice to the class.
 Music can do a lot of wonderful things for people. If you have a way to incorporate music into your classroom or lessons, do so. Maybe you even have the ability to allow your students to select the music.

 If you want to get your kitten spayed or neutered when it is two months old, then look for signs that it is that age. In general, a kitten that is two months old should weigh approximately two pounds, as long as it has had proper nutrition and care.Two pounds is the weight that is required for your kitten to get desexing surgery. Any lighter than that and the veterinarian performing the surgery may be worried about the kitten's ability to survive the surgery.
 If you are not sure how old your kitten is, you can estimate its age by assessing its physical characteristics. Newborn kittens have closed eyes and ears that are tucked against their heads. These clues signal that you have a kitten that it only a few weeks old.However, if your kitten has open eyes and popped up ears but tiny baby teeth, then it is between one and three months old.
A cat that it getting, or already has, its adult teeth is at least four months old.
 A two month old kitten should be fully weaned from its mother. If your kitten is still nursing, then it is probably not yet two months old. If you notice the kitten's mother trying to wean the kitten, for example not letting it nurse, then the kitten is probably between one and one and a half months old.Kittens that are two months old are also working on their paw and eye coordination. If a kitten is playing a lot with toys and getting more daring, then it is probably at least two months old.

 When designing your seasonal vegetable garden, plan to include shade plants that suppress weeds include squash, pumpkin, melons, tomatoes and potatoes.;
, When planning your garden at the beginning of the season, vary the placement of your favorite vegetable plants to slow down weed growth in last year's exposed garden areas. Rotate shade plants with those plants that have smaller leaf spreads, such as lettuce and garlic.
 If your dormant garden area is covered with weeds, be sure to remove as many as possible before planting this season's crops. The fewer of last year's weeds that you start with, the less you will have to remove this year.
 A black plastic layer placed over garden rows will prevent the sun's rays and heat from expediting weed germination. Other weed prevention covers include covering bare soil with organic mulch mixes such as bark chips, straw and layered newspaper., Pulling weeds by hand or utilizing a mechanical weed pulling tool on a regular basis prevents weeds from becoming unmanageable and difficult to remove. Remember that the more a weed's root system spreads, the harder it is to pull up from the soil.
 When breaks in the soil around your vegetable plants appear, weed seeds can easily burrow into the soil. Harvest your vegetable plants as gently as possible to prevent soil disturbances.
 If weeds become unmanageable, a rototiller can quickly remove them without too much physically-demanding labor by the operator. Rototillers are one of the fastest mechanical weed removal methods but overuse can deplete the soil of nutrients and beneficial worms. Use rototillers sparingly.

 Steaming your shrimp does not add any extra calories and fat through cooking oils. To steam your shrimp, place your shrimp in a covered basket with small holes. Place this basket above a pot of boiling water. The heat from the steam will cook the shrimp.Steaming takes about five to six minutes.Shrimp will turn a pinkish color when they're done.
Any prep work, such as shelling or seasoning the shrimp, should be done prior to steaming them.;
, Grilling shrimp also limits additives. First, brush the shrimp with oil or a non-stick spray. Place your shrimp near the edge of the grill. After a few minutes, your shrimp will start to release some moisture. At this point, flip your shrimp and allow them to cook for a few minutes on the other side.You can use grilling skewers or a grill basket to prevent your shrimp from falling through the grill grates.
 While sauteeing shrimp calls for the use of oil, heart healthy oils like olive oil will keep your dish healthy. Olive oil can also add some flavor. Heat up your oil in a pan over medium heat and then add the shrimp. Cook the shrimp for two to three minutes on each side. When done, the shrimp should be a bright, pink shade.While olive oil is healthy, it is high in calories. Make sure to only use a small amount of oil while cooking your shrimp. The precise amount depends on how many shrimp you're grilling, as more shrimp need more oil, but try to stick to only one to two tablespoons.
 Boiling your shrimp only requires water and a bit of salt, so it does not add calories to the shrimp. Add your water and shrimp to a pot. Bring it to a boil. Allow it to boil for only two minutes before removing the pot from the heat. Cover the pot and let it sit for five to ten minutes before serving your shrimp.Smaller shrimp only need about five minutes to cook, while larger ones should cook for closer to ten minutes.

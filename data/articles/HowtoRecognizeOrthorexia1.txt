 People with orthorexia are obsessive about reading the labels of their food. While reading labels can provide valuable information about the ingredients of the food you consume, it can also develop into a compulsive behavior that impacts other aspects of our lives.Be concerned if:


You have to re-read labels several times because you're worried that you missed an ingredient.
You develop anxiety or panic attacks if you are unable to read labels.
You develop a distrust of labels entirely.;
, Many peopleâ€™s communities may not offer alternatives for people with special dietary needs. As a result, vegans, people who require kosher or halal meat, or even gluten or lactose intolerant people, may need to travel to a nearby city for certain products. While this is understandable and quite normal, people with orthorexia might take it to the next level.


Think about how much food you don't buy in your own town or city.
Consider whether it is actually necessary to travel outside of your community. Are you doing it because you need to, or because of your compulsion?
Think about whether your traveling for food is taking time away from family, work, or your social life. If it is, you may have orthorexia., While limiting foods can be beneficial to improving health, many people with orthorexia take this to an extreme level. If you cut out the vast majority of foods that people eat, you may have a problem. Consider whether you cut out all or some of the following:


Gluten
Dairy
Natural flavors
Additives and preservatives
Non-organic foods
Meats with antibiotics
Genetically modified fruits or vegetables
All foods in which you cannot verify ingredients

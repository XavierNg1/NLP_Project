 This is 'one' in Gaeilge, and it is pronounced 'ah hay-on'.






A dó. A dó is number two, and is said 'ah doe'. (A bit like Homer Simpson's catchphrase!)






Number 3: Three in Gaeilge is 'a trí'. You say it : 'ah tree'.






Four: 'A ceathair'. This is pronounced, 'ah ca-hur'.






A cúig - number five! You say it like 'a coo-ig'.





;
, If you cannot learn it all off the first time, don't worry! If you are not familiar with Gaeilge, it could take a while to learn it all off. To make sure you don't forget any numbers, go over them in your head from time to time.
 This is six in Gaeilge, and is said like this: 'Ah shay'.






A seacht. Pronounced 'ah shocked'.






Eight: a hocht. Say it like 'ah hooked'.






Almost there! Number Nine: a naoi. It is said like 'ah knee'.






Ten! 'A deich'. This is pronounced, 'ah jeh'. It has a sort of 'D' sound at the 'jeh' part.
 Keep going over them until you know it all off: A haon, a dó, a trí, a ceathair, a cúig, a sé, a seacht, a hocht, a naoi, a deich!

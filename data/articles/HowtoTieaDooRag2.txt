 Turn the durag inside out so that the seam is on the outside. This will ensure that the seam does not leave an impression in your hair overnight. Place the durag so that the seam lines up with the center of your face.You can use a durag made of any kind of material you like.
 Take one tail in each hand and wrap it toward the back of your head. The tails should cross in the back of your head. Once they’ve crossed, pull them all the way around the head, so that they cross at your forehead before wrapping around to the back.Don’t tie the ties. That will leave lines on your forehead if you sleep that way.
To get the ties to stay in place momentarily, you can twist them together.
 Get a soft headband that you would wear for sports to catch sweat. It should have firm elastic but not be uncomfortable or too tight to wear overnight.Tuck the durag in underneath the headband.
It’s possible to sleep in a durag without using a headband. However, this technique will minimize the risk of the durag leaving lines on your face and it is very comfortable.
 Once the durag is tucked into the headband, pull gently on the ties to separate them. They should now be free and no longer wrapped around your head. You can tuck them into the back of the headband so that they don’t get tangled while you sleep.It’s possible to leave the ties wrapped overnight, but undoing them may be more comfortable and prevent the durag from leaving lines on your forehead.
 Make sure to tuck the flap up into the headband as well. This will make sure it doesn’t get tugged on while you’re sleeping, which could dislodge the durag from the headband.You can roll the flap up and tuck it in or try simply stuffing it inside the headband.

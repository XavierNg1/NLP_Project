 Create 3 worksheets: Data, Chart (unless working with Chart Wizard) and Saves.;
,
In Edit, set all the first options to checked except Automatically Convert Date System . Set Display number of decimal places to blank (as integers are preferred). Preserve the display of dates and set 30 for 21st century cutoff.
In View, click on show Formula Bar and Status Bar and hover for comments of all Objects . Check Show grid lines and set all boxes below that to auto or checked.
In Chart, allow show chart names and set data markers on hover and leave the rest unchecked for now.
In Calculation, make sure Automatically is checked and calculate before save is also checked. Set max change to .001 as goal-seeking is not done in this project. Check save external link values and use 1904 system

In Error checking, check all the options.
In Save, select save preview picture with new files and Save Autorecover after five minutes
In Ribbon, keep all of them checked except Hide group titles and Developer .
 It helps by placing the cursor between the A of Column A and the 1 in Row 1 in the upper leftmost corner and selecting the entire worksheet. Format Cells Number Number Custom +0.00;-0.00;+0.00, Font Size 9 or 10.

Into cell C1 enter SPHEROIDS and into cell D1 enter 36.
Into cell E1 enter BASE and into cell F1 enter "=16*103*24/(SPHEROIDS*2)" w/o quotes.
Into cell A2 enter Rrs and into cell B2 enter "=ADJROWS/SPHEROIDS" w/o quotes.
Into cell C2 enter Radius and into cell D2 enter "=SPHEROIDS/VLOOKUP(SPHEROIDS,LOOKER3,2)" w/o quotes.
Into cell E2 enter FACTOR and into cell F2 enter "=VLOOKUP(SPHEROIDS,FactorLooker,3)" w/o quotes.
Into cell A3 enter On_0_Off_1 and into cell B3 enter 0.
Into cell C3 enter CircleFactor and into cell D3 enter 0.125 and format cell number number Custom +0.000;-0.000;+0.000
Select cell range A1:B3 and Insert Name Create Names in Left Column, OK. Select cell range C1:D3 and Insert Name Create Names in Left Column, OK. Select cell range E1:F2 and Insert Name Create Names in Left Column, OK. There should not be anymore NAME errors except in D2 and F2 related to the Lookup Tables yet to be input.
Format cells align right cell range I1:I3. Input to cell I1 SPHEROIDS2 and enter to J1 1.
Into cell I2 enter BASE2 and into cell J2 enter "=16*103*24/(SPHEROIDS2*2)" w/o quotes.
Into cell I3 enter ShrinkExpand and into J3 enter .75; select cell range I1:J3 and Insert Name Create Names in Left Column, OK.
Into cell L1 enter FACTOR2 and into cell K1 enter 1.75. Into cell M1 make the note (formula overwritten).
Into cell L2 enter Radius2 and into cell K2 enter "=SPHEROIDS2/VLOOKUP(SPHEROIDS2,LOOKER3,2)" w/o quotes.
Into cell L3 enter ShrinkExpand2 and into cell K3 enter 2.
Select cell range K1:L3 and Insert Name Create Names in Right Column, OK.
 Into cell L6 enter 1 and select range L6:L105 and Edit Fill Series Column Linear Step Value 1, OK. As for the rest of the top of the chart for cell range cell M1:N28, copy the values from the following picture please:






For the values from M28:M105, they are all equal to 6. And all the values for cell range N28:N105 are equal to .8
Edit Go To cell range L6:M105 and Insert Name Define Name LOOKER3 to cell range $L$6:$M$105.
Edit Go To cell range L6:N105 and Insert Name Define Name FactorLooker to cell range $L$6:$N$105. Format fill cell range L6:N105 color canary yellow. Format cell N9 number number 6 decimal places (use the formula beside it to input it, w/o the leading period).
 This means that every other spheroid will appear when the variable On_0_Off_1 is set to 0.
A5: Enter OK to S=36. This means that the above On/Off mechanism works up to 36 spheroids. After that, the formula would have to be lengthened and there's a limit to how much further it can be lengthened.






B4: Left2Right;   B5: Top2Btm -- this means that by using 720 instead of ROW()-6 for the Cos and Sin calculations, the chart starts at the 12 o'clock position and moves clockwise left to right and top to bottom.
C5: t; This is the traditional variable for the number of turns/spheroid but that's been changed.
D5: Cos; E5: Sin
F4, H4 and J4: Charting; G4: Solids; I4: Ring; K4: Center
F5: Main X; G5: Main Y
H5: X2; I5: Y2
J5: X3; K5: Y3

, Format Fill yellow and font red bold size 14, with red border bold outline.
Constants and Titles of the  Solid (Main) Spheroids: Command+Select all of the following cells: B1,B2,D2,D3,F1,F2,F4 and G4. Format Fill black with white font size 12. Format cell D3 number number custom +0.000;-0.000;+0.000 (2880 rows * .125 = 360 degrees in a circle.).
Constant and Title of the Spheroid Ring: Command+Select the following cells: H4,I4 and J3 and format fill dark/electric blue with white font, size 12.
Variables, Constant and Titles of Center Spheroid: Command+Select the following cells C6,J2,K2,J4 and K4 and format fill red with white font, size 12.
All of the Variable or Constant titles should be aligned next to the their related number, in most cases, aligned right, except in column L where they're aligned left. All the variables and constants should be aligned center, as should the headings (or titles). Row 5 headings should be underlined.
 Into cell A6, enter the following formula, without quotes or spaces:
"=IF(OR(AND((ROW()-7)>Rrs*1,(ROW()-7)<=Rrs*2),
AND((ROW()-7)>Rrs*3,(ROW()-7)<=Rrs*4),

 Copy the chart that appears atop your data and paste it to the Chart worksheet, ow work on the chart that's on your Data worksheet and later copy it to the Chart worksheet. Select Chart Layout and get rid of grid lines, axes and legend. Do Current Selection Plot Area Format Selection. Fill should be Gradient Radial Centered with Red at left 12% and Navy Blue on Right at 52%.
Do Chart Layout Current Selection Series 1 Format Selection. Smoothed Line for Line and Gradient should be Radial Centered Canary Yellow 52%, Red 65%, Midnight Blue from the Color Wheel 82% (just barely effectual/visible), Line Weight should be 20 point ("SOLID"). OK.
Click in the Plot Area and do menu item Chart Add Data and in response to the query, activate the Data worksheet and Edit Go To cell range H6:I2886, OK. This may not come out OK, in which case, edit the series in the Formula Bar until it reads "=SERIES(,Data!$H$6:$H$2886,Data!$I$6:$I$2886,2)" without quotes. Do Chart Layout Series 2 Format Selection. Line is dark blue .5 pt.
Click in the Plot Area and do menu item Chart Add Data and in response to the query, activate the Data worksheet and Edit Go To cell range J6:K2886, OK. This may not come out OK, in which case, edit the series in the Formula Bar until it reads "=SERIES(,Data!$J$6:$J$2886,Data!$K$6:$K$2886,3)" without quotes. Do Chart Layout Series 3 Format Selection. Line is smoothed dark slight charcoal purple .5 pt. lightest DASHED, 2% TRANSPARENT.

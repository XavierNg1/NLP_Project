 Spotted cats earned their name because of the broken lines in their coat patterns. This "broken" coat pattern may cause the lines to appear as spots, though this cat is still very much a tabby., The "spots" on the spotted tabby's coat can come in a variety of shapes and sizes. They may be large or small, and may appear to be round, ovular, or rose-shaped., Though every spotted tabby's coat will be slightly different, some may be easily confused with a mackerel tabby. Certain spotted tabbies may have "spots" that extend from a spinal stripe, like the mackerel tabby. The difference is that a spotted tabby will still have a more blotchy or spotted appearance.

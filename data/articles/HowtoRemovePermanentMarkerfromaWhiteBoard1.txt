It doesn't matter what color dry erase marker you use.;
, This occurs because permanent and dry-erase markers contain a non-polar solvent. The solvent in the dry-erase marker will dissolve the permanent marker, detaching it from the surface of the board.
 It may take multiple attempts to get the marker off completely.You may want to try a dry-erase cleaning solution, but they contain similar, some times weaker, solvents as the dry erase marker, so the marker is actually more effective.

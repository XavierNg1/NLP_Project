 Christmas comes on the heels of Thanksgiving, so channel the gratitude from your Thanksgiving holiday into the Christmas holiday. If you arenâ€™t feeling particularly grateful for anything, sit down and write three people or things you are glad to have in your life. This can help you to see the positive things in your life and perhaps start to feel a bit of Christmas cheer.;
, Christmas is historically a Christian holiday but is now celebrated by all kinds of people with various backgrounds. If Christmas is a meaningful holiday to you for religious or spiritual reasons, take some time to nurture that part of yourself by going to church or meeting with a spiritual leader you trust and respect. If you are not spiritual, take some time to enjoy the special time of year and celebrate in the way you see fit., Christmas represents the winding down of a busy year, with many people taking time off and vacations to relax and unwind. It also signifies renewal, as the new year approaches. This would be a great time to reflect on what you would like to accomplish in the coming year. Write out your thoughts in a journal, blog, or Microsoft Word document on your computer.

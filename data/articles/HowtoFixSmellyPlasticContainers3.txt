 If washing and soaking the container don't work to absorb the odor, you can place absorbing agents inside the plastic container that will absorb bad smells. Salt is one such substance that can be used to absorb odors. Add a large pinch of salt to the inside of the container and leave it in a clump in the middle. Then cover it with the lid and leave it overnight. Just make sure to wipe out the salt before you use the container., Newspaper can also absorb bad odors left inside plastic containers. Take several sheets of newspaper, then tear and crumple them and place them inside the container with the lid on. The paper should soak up the bad odors if you leave it there for 24-48 hours.Wash the container after taking out the newspaper, since the newspaper may be dirty.
 Coffee grounds are great at absorbing odors. After making the morning coffee, place the used coffee grounds in the plastic container. Used coffee grounds work better than fresh ones. Put the lid on and let the grounds sit in the container for about a day until the odor is gone., Place the open plastic container outside on a sunny day. The sun has great odor-fighting abilities, and leaving the container open will allow the container to air out.If you arenâ€™t able to put the container directly outside, you can also just put it on a sunny windowsill.
 Vanilla extract has a powerful, pleasant smell that can mask the bad odor of your plastic container. To use vanilla extract, put a few tablespoons of water in the container along with a few drops of extract, then shut the container. You can also pour the vanilla on a cloth, put the cloth in the container and close the lid, leaving the vanilla to permeate the container for several hours.

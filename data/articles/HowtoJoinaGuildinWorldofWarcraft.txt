 Go into towns or any places where there could be a lot players hanging out. Guilds who are looking for members often hang around these areas, like Ironforge and Stormwind City. You can either teleport back to the nearest town or use a mage portal if there’s one near your location.;
, If a player belongs to a guild, the guild name will be displayed below the character’s name enclosed within a greater than and less than symbol (<Guild Name>) so it’s easy for other players to identify if they already belong to another guild. You can also write /who <player name> in the chat and this will show the level, class, race and guild (if he belongs to one)

, When other players notice that you don’t have a guild, they will eventually approach you. They will either send you a message either on the Global Message Box or through a private message, both located at the lower-left corner of the screen.


Some guild members will just automatically send you a Guild Invite.
Relatively, you can proactively talk to players with guilds via the Global Message Box and ask them to send you an invite. If they agree, they’ll send you one.
Keep in mind that not all guild members can send invites. Only members with invite privileges assigned by the guild leader can send invites. So if players tell you that they can’t invite you to their guild, they probably don’t have the privilege to do so.
 An Invite prompt will show up on your screen once you receive an invitation. The prompt will include the guild’s name and its guild level. If you wish to accept the invite, click on “Join Guild”; otherwise, click on “Decline Invitation” to reject it.
 Joining a guild is just like joining any other groups. You need active participation to keep the guild alive. Join item and boss hunts whenever you can, and be friendly with your guild mates.


When you’re active enough, the guild leader will eventually promote you to higher ranks, such as a Guild Officer.

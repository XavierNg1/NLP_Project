 Although Both Disney parks (Florida and California) contain many parks, Walt Disney World is sprawled out over several miles.;
, Most of the theme parks can be arrived at by the Disney shuttles. Not all locations have Disney Express shuttle stops. Sometimes you will need another mode of free transportation -- a boat or monorail -- where the shuttle can become your "main contact point".
, At the park, there are big boards that show designated bus stops. In some of the resort locations there is just one stop for everything.
 Busses arrive and depart about every twenty minutes. So, be patient. Wait times after the parks close can be slightly longer although Disney does send more busses out.
 Take small children by the hand, watch your head, and step aboard.
 Allow elderly people or those traveling in wheelchairs to board first and to let them pick a better location for their seat (most often near or with) their family. You may stand, as long as you don't lean on the shuttle doors, stay behind any yellow lines, and hold a handrail or strap.
, While waiting for the bus to come to a complete stop, gather your belongings.
 Take small children by the hand, watch your head (and step) as you exit.

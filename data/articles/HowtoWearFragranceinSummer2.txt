 Instead of dousing yourself with fragrance in the morning, spritz one or two sprays on your pulse points. Carry a refresher bottle with you in your bag or purse. Re-apply small doses of the fragrance to your pulse points three to five times a day, or whenever the fragrance fades.Your pulse points are the insides of your wrists and elbows, behind your ears and knees, and the front and back of your neck. These spots generate the most heat, which helps to release the fragrance.
 Freshly washed hair holds scents very well. After you have combed your wet hair, apply the perfume to the tips of your hair.If you do not want to apply the perfume directly to your hair, then spray your comb or brush with the perfume. Proceed to comb your hair with the scented brush.
 Instead of spraying your body, spray the inside seams of your clothes. As your body temperature rises, the heat will release the fragrance.Alternatively, try dousing a washcloth with your favorite fragrance. Place the washcloth with your clothes, hats, scarves, and other accessories for a day or two. When you wear your clothes, they will have a lovely, but light scent.

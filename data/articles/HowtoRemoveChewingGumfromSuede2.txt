 This works best if you have already managed to get some of the gum off of the suede. Take a soft eraser such as an Artgum eraser and rub it over the gum remains. Don't rub too vigorously. This could actually have the opposite effect you're going for and make the gum stick even more to the suede.
Use even, soft strokes, focusing on the areas with the most gum.
You can also use a normal pencil eraser or a Pink Pearl eraser if you do not have an Artgum eraser.
 A toothbrush is a great tool because its many bristles can attack the gum from different angles. Take a toothbrush you don't mind getting dirty and brush at the gum softly but firmly. Again, don't scrub at the suede because this can damage the material even further. Try to brush only in one direction; this is less damaging to the material. , You can buy brushes specifically made for suede. You can find these at major stores like Walmart. Some suede brushes even come with erasers. Again, try to brush in one direction.

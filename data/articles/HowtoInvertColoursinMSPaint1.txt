 Don’t look for the Invert Colors tool on the top toolbar, as you might have in Windows Vista or earlier. Beginning with MS Paint 6.1, you can only invert colors by selecting and right-clicking the image. This means that if you are running Windows 7, 8, or 10, then this new iteration of Paint will be pre-installed.This might be confusing if you've spent years using the top toolbar to tweak your colors – but never fear! The new process is different, but it is still very simple.


The Invert Colors tool is useful if you want to simply swap around the existing colors on a logo or image, rather than replace the entire color.;
, If you want to invert the colors in the entire image, you'll need to select the image as a whole. You can corral the image with the Select tool, or you can choose "Select all" from the Select Options.If you only want to invert the colors in part of the image: simply select the piece of the image that you’d like to invert.
 First, right-click on the image with your mouse. Then, scroll down to the “Invert color” option at the bottom of the drop-down menu. Click "Invert color." The section of the image you selected should immediately invert.For a quick color inversion, press the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+I.

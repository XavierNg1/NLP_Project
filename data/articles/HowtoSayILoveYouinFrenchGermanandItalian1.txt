 As with any language, there are dozens of ways to tell someone you love them. Start small and work your way up. You may be nervous to begin with, so it's best to start simple.


"I love you" is "Je t'aime." It sounds like zhuh - tem. This is the strongest way to tell someone you care.
"I adore you" is "Je t'adore." It sounds like zhuh - tah - door (the r is very soft and should only be hinted at).
"I want you" is "Je te désire." It sounds like zhuh - tuh - duh - zai - uh.;
, As with anything, practice will make saying these words so much easier. The sounds in French aren't the same as in English; practice the accent along with the words.


Almost every translation website has an audio option. Listen to a native speaker say the words and emulate the exact sound. There are also plenty of videos on the web that can show you the exact mouth and tongue formation to nail the sound.
 If you've got the "Je t'aime" down, go a little above and beyond to express your feelings. There are many more poetic, meaningful ways to show your emotions.


Add terms of endearment. Just like you might say, "I love you, babe," or "I love you, sweetheart," the same goes in French. "Mon amour," "ma/mon chéri(e)," and "mon bébé" will spruce up the phrase. That's "my love," "my darling," and "my baby", respectively. "Ma chérie" is for a woman; "mon chéri" is for a man.

The possessive adjectives "mon" and "ma" (my) have to agree with the gender of the term of endearment -- not your own gender nor necessarily that of the person you're talking to. Generally speaking, masculine terms of endearment can be used for men and women, while feminine terms of endearment can only be used for women.

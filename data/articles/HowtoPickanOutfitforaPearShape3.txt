 Almost any height of heels will help to give a sense of more elongation. However, do not wear really high heels.


Peep-toe shoes are a good choice.
 Avoid wearing any low-cut boots as these give the impression of chunkiness.
 Pointed flats will accentuate the pear shape; on the other hand, pointed high heels are fine.

 All four characters are ladies, not girls. They all age throughout the seasons of the show, occasionally telling lies about their exact ages, but at almost all times, being mature.
 To be lady like the Sex and the City Way, you absolutely must be loyal. Don't stand up your friends for a guy. Don't let your friends down when they need you and never take advantage of their misfortunes.
 Don't be a bigot. Be friends with homosexuals, older people, younger people, people with mental health issues, rich, poor, everyone who respects you deserves your respect.
 Wear what you feel comfortable in. Over dress, under dress, as long as you feel fabulous, wear it. When with friends, you can be as casual as you wish, but when in public, always dress appropriately and be well groomed.

, Right-click the bar at the top of the window, and select “Properties” from the context menu.
 At the bottom of the Properties box will be a checkbox that says “Use legacy console (requires relaunch).” Uncheck this box, then hit the “OK” button and close CMD.
 Launch CMD as described earlier, and open the Properties box once more.
 There should be four different tabs on the top of the properties box. Click the Colors tab. At the bottom you should see a slider inside a box with the header “Opacity.” Adjust the opacity to the level you like. You will notice the level of transparency will change as you adjust. Click “OK” when you are finished.

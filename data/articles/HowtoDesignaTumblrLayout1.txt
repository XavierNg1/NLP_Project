 Theme Makers, or rather Generators, are easy to use, and don't require a lot of effort. They are easily found online, just by googling "Tumblr Layout Maker.";
, Many of these Maker's will have a range of pre-picked options, for colours, for the size of the letters, and posts, as well as other objects, and thing, from which you can choose.
 Of your letters, posts, profile photo, columns, and others. These things are easily changed, just by retyping a value of some size, or selecting from a list.
 Some makers have many options when it comes how many columns you will have, or if they will be centered, or a little bit to the left, or right. Some even have many styles for yourÂ posts which you can choose from.
 Everything looks good? Good. Now there's bound to be a save button somewhere there. Just find it and click it. All done!

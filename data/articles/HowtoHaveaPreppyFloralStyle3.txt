 Bathe regularly and keep an overall tidy appearance. If you want to carry the floral style into your hygiene routine, use flower-scented shampoos, body lotions, and body washes. A small spritz of a floral perfume may also make a nice accent for special occasions.



Smooth out your skin with a sheer foundation that closely matches your skin tone.
Apply a light coating of blush to the apples of your cheeks.
Use eye make-up sparingly. A light coating of a pink or nude eyeshadow is fine, and a clear mascara can lengthen your lashes without weighing them down. Avoid heavy liners and dark mascaras.
Wipe a light pink lip gloss over your lips. Glosses work better than lipsticks, and light pink shades work better than deep reds.
 Avoid long nails and immediately trim away nails that chip or crack. If you want to apply polish, stick with clear or nude colors.
 If you have thick, unruly brows, pluck them down into neat arches. Do not get carried away, though. You should not need to draw any part of your eyebrow in with pencil. If you do, then you may have removed too much.
 Long, straight hair is traditional for most preppy looks, but long, curly hair suits the preppy floral style just as nicely as long as you keep your curls tamed instead of frizzy. Short bobbed styles may also work well.

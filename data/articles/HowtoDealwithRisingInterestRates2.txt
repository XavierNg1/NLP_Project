 This is good advice for everyone, all the time. But especially in a market with an expectation of increasing interest rates, you should be careful to limit your spending on credit. Budget your money so you know what you bring in each month, and limit your spending to what you can afford to pay off in full at the end of the month.Certainly, some emergencies may arise that could require you to extend your credit beyond your immediate ability to pay. If so, work to pay down those balances as quickly as possible.
 If you are carrying a balance on a credit card, which almost certainly has a high interest rate, you should do almost anything you can to pay it off. One possibility is a home equity loan, if you own your house. Home equity loans have interest rates that are generally much lower than credit card rates. You can borrow the money at a lower rate, and use it to pay off your credit card at the higher rate.The home equity loan, besides just having a lower interest rate, has the added benefit of being tax deductible as well. The credit card interest is not tax deductible.
 Many lenders will occasionally make offers for new credit card accounts, and a common incentive is to offer 0% interest for some period of time. You often have the opportunity to roll over any pending balance from another credit card, and pay it off with the new card at 0%. This can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars.


Read the details of any new credit card offer carefully. Make sure that balance transfers or cash advances are included in the 0% offer. Some lenders may make the 0% rate very public but then limit its applicability.
 If you have any large-item purchases in mind, and you are aware that interest rates are likely to rise, you should make those purchases soon, if possible. Make the purchase and work to pay for the item as soon as you can, while rates are still low.

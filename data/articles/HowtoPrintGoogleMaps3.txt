 Enter in a starting and ending location and choose your mode of transportation. Google will create a route and set of directions for your trip. You will be able to print the map with the route on it as well as turn-by-turn directions.
 This is located above the buttons for modes of transportation.
 You can use the box at the top of the directions list to add notes to the page.
 You can hover over each entry in the directions list and choose to enable a small map for that turn. You can also choose to add a Street View picture to any of the steps.
 The box is located at the top of the window. If you include the large map, it will be added to the top of the list. You can pan and zoom the map to get the optimal picture.
 Once you are satisfied with your directions and maps, click the "Print" button in the upper-right corner. If you don't see a "Print" button, press Ctrl + P (Windows) or Command + P (Mac), or select "Print" from the browser's File or Settings menu.
 Choose your page orientation and color preferences from the print settings menu. You may find it easier to read the directions if the page is set to the "Portrait" orientation. If you added the large map and lots of turn maps, you may want to switch it to grayscale.
 Once your settings are correct, you can send the directions to your printer.

 If your child does have an after-school meltdown, you should be prepared for it and deal with it accordingly. Start by acknowledging your child’s feelings. They are likely feeling tired, burned out, and irritated. Reassure them that you understand they are just tired from school and lashing out because they are stressed. Doing this can help to deescalate the situation and let them know you are on their side.For example, you may say to your child, “We’re tired out from school, aren’t we?” or “You had a long day, didn’t you? You’re ready to have a snack and chill out.”

, If there are other children in your home, you should have your child move to a separate area, such as their bedroom. This will give them a space to calm down and take a few deep breaths. Have them stay in their room for five to ten minutes as this will give them a chance to calm down and be on their own.Often, some alone time in a safe space like their bedroom can help them to relax and let go of any stress from school.
This is also a good way to avoid upsetting the other children and help to maintain a calm space for everyone else in your household.
 Rather than try to solve your child’s issue for them or get angry at them, let them calm down on their own. You may leave them with their toys or books and a small snack. After a few minutes, they should calm down and become engaged in a toy or their snack.Once your child has calmed down and the meltdown has passed, you may then ask them about their day at school or ask them if they’d like to play with you. Engage with them only after they have calmed down.

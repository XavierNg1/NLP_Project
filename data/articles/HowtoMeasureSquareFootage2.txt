 If you're looking for an approximation of square footage, you can also try measuring the outside of your home and then subtracting any areas that won't be factored in to the square footage, such as the porch stairs or garage.









Ceiling and floor tiles are often one square foot in size. You can simply count these to get a close approximation of the total square footage.
 If there's a part of your house that's shaped like a half of a circle, you can find the square footage of the circle by finding the area of the space as if it were a full circle and then dividing it by half. To do this, simply measure the long line that cuts the "circle" in half to get the diameter.









Then, divide it by 2 to get the radius, and then plug that into the equation A = Ï€r^2 where r is the radius, and divide by 2 to get the area, or square footage, of the half circle.
 If you're measuring a space that is almost fully a square or a rectangle, with only a small square or rectangular part missing, then measure the square footage of the entire space as if the missing part was filled in. Then, find the square footage of the missing part and subtract it from the overall square footage to find the square footage of the space. This will save you time.

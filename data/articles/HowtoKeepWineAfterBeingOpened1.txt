 Close a bottle of wine after pouring individual glasses from it. Use the cork that the bottle came with, or a reusable wine stopper.

Re-cork properly by inserting the cork into the bottle in the same direction as when you pulled it out. Avoid putting the “clean” side of the cork into the bottle facing the wine, even if it seems easier to do so, as it may not be clean and could in fact contaminate the wine.If you don’t have a cork or stopper available to seal your wine bottle, use a small piece of plastic wrap to cover the mouth of the bottle, then secure with a rubber band.;
, Put any leftover wine in a bottle into a wine chiller or the refrigerator. Keep most wine for a few days this way.

Don’t store the wine bottle horizontally on its side once opened, whether on a rack or in the refrigerator. This will expose a greater surface area of the wine to oxygen.Note that keeping wine in the refrigerator will not keep it from going bad, but it can slow down the chemical process responsible for making the wine lose its flavor.
 Keep an opened wine bottle away from direct sunlight and high heat. Favor cool, dark areas or a fridge.

Avoid storage in temperatures above 70° F. Also keep the wine away from a window to prevent heating and discoloration from the sun.When taking leftover red wine out of storage in the fridge or other cool place, let it warm up gradually. Place the bottle in lukewarm water, or simply bring it out of the fridge about an hour before serving.

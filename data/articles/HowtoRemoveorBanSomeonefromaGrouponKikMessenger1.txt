 Do this by tapping on the Kik icon in your phone's list of apps.;
, The group chat in question will open.
 The icon is located at the top-right corner of the screen. You'll be brought to a menu listing all of the participants in the group.
 The screen will introduce an enlarged version of the user's picture, along with options under the person's name.


You must be a group admin to see this option. If you are not the group admin, message the group's admin directly and ask them to ban the member for you.
 This will remove the user from the group and permanently prevent them from rejoining it.

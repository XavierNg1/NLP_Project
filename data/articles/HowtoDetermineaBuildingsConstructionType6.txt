 ISO Class 5 encompasses IBC Type IB.



Buildings with exterior walls, floors, and roofs of masonry materials described in the definition of fire resistive (Construction Class 6) â€” less thick than required for fire-resistive structures but not less than four inches thick, or
Fire-resistive materials with a fire-resistance rating less than two hours but not less than one hour

, Materials include:

concrete
plaster
clay tile
brick or other masonry units
gypsum block
gypsum wallboard
mastic coatings
mineral and fiberboard
mineral wool



Ceilings protecting steel beams or joists: What happens when there is no fire-protection material applied to steel beams or joists that support floors or roofs? ISO still considers a building modified fire resistive if it has a suitable ceiling. Ceilings can be plaster or gypsum wallboard or suspended mineral tile. The entire floor-ceiling (a fire-resistive ceiling protecting a floor) or roof-ceiling (a fire-resistive ceiling protecting roof supports) should conform to construction details in a UL-listed or Factory Mutual (FM)-approved design. ISO individually evaluates each approved design.

 Get a copy of both the original, complete song as well as the instrumental version. Sing along to the original song and then immediately afterward, sing along to the instrumental version. This will be much more challenging because you’ll have no help from the singer on the original track. You’ll be on your own if you forget details such as how to start the next verse or how the song ends., Study just the first line of the song and then sing it out loud without the lyrics in front of you. Then study the second line and sing both line 1 and 2 without the lyrics in front of you. Continue memorizing this way until you can sing the entire song without looking.If the song isn’t in your native language, make sure that you’re getting the pronunciation right as you memorize so that you don’t memorize the words incorrectly.
 Print out the song’s lyrics and then read a section out loud. Then flip the page over and try to recite the entire section again. Do this for all sections of the song over and over until you can recite nearly all of them. You should eventually be able to speak the entire song out loud with the sheet of paper turned over.You can also read through the lyrics earlier on in the memorization process to help familiarize yourself with them.
 Without any music to listen to or printed lyrics to read, try to sing the entire song in your head. If you get stuck, quickly glance at the printed lyrics and find the spot that you’re stuck at. Then flip the lyrics back over and continue running through the song in your head. Repeat this process until you can get through the entire song without looking at the printed lyrics.

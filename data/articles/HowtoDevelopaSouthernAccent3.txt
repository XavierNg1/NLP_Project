The slow Southern Drawl is more common in the past and in rural areas than in metropolitan areas like Atlanta or Birmingham. Usually, they are grouped into categories by region. Here are two major regions into which the South is divided as well as their differences in speech:


Coastal/Lowland: Drop your "r"s at the end of words and blend them with the next word (as in, "bigguh dog" instead of "bigger dog"). Turn short vowels, like "dog," into longer diphthongs ("dah-wug").
Inland/Mountain: Exaggerate the "oo" sound in words like "loose." Pay more attention to the "o" in words like "coat.", Get used to the way the Southern accent sounds. In the Netflix series House of Cards, Frank Underwood has a slight Southern accent, while in some movies, such as Forrest Gump, many of the characters have stronger Southern accents. The TV Show "Justified" has excellent modern day Mountain regional accents. Watch a variety of movies and shows to get a feel for different types of Southern accents., If you know someone with a Southern accent, ask them to sit down and talk with you. If you don’t know someone with a Southern accent, ask around until you find someone who knows what you want to do and doesn’t mind talking to you for a little bit. Repeat the same words over and over again, and try to say the words exactly how the other person says them. Ask them to correct you on how you say certain words and to coach you on how to say these words.

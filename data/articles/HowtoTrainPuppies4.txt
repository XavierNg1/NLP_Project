 Puppies tend to pull on their leashes because they're full of extra energy and excited to be outside. If possible, tire your puppy out by playing with her before you put her on a leash for the day.Try throwing your puppy's favorite ball for her for about 10 minutes before you try to put on her leash.
 Puppies often get excited when it's time to go outside, jumping up on their owners and barking in anticipation of going on a walk. This problem can go on for years if you don't resolve it while your puppy is still young.


If your puppy barks and jumps on you when you pick up a leash, wait until she is completely calm before putting it on. Do this over and over until she learns that she won't get to go outside until she behaves., Start walking with your puppy outside. When she runs ahead and pulls on the leash, halt. Wait for her to turn around, say "come," and when she's at your side, tell her to "sit." Reward her with a treat, then continue walking. Repeat the process until she learns to walk alongside you instead of pulling on the leash.When your puppy walks beside you, reward her frequently so she knows that's where she's supposed to walk.
Continue using the red light, green light method for a few weeks. It may take awhile before your dog learns not to pull you down the street.

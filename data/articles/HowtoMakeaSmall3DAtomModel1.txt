 You will need glue, scissors, cardstock, string, 40 large craft balls (20 of one color for the protons and the other 20 for the neutrons that's a different color), and 20 small craft balls for the electrons
, Glue both colored craft balls into a ball, alternating between the protons and neutrons as you glue.This will resemble the nucleus., Cut out a small, a medium, a large, and an extra-large ring using the scissors., Using the string, tie all the rings in a concentric circle around the nucleus., Glue two small craft balls to the small circle, eight on the medium circle, eight to the large circle, and then two to the extra-large circle. These will resemble all the electrons on the atom.,, You can now show off and display your 3D model of the atom calcium.

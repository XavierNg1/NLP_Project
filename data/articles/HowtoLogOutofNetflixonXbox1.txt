 The Netflix app has a built-in function on all supported Xbox consoles that you can use to quickly log out of your account.
 Using the D-pad (the cross-shaped directional button), you can enter a series of directions to bring up a shortcut with quick access to the Sign Out option. The code is as follows: up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, up, up, up, up.You can do this from anywhere on the Netflix app (e.g., in the middle of a show).
 This is at the bottom of the resulting menu; you'll have to scroll to the bottom by pressing down on either the D-pad or the left analog stick., This will promptly sign you out of your Netflix account and return you to the sign-in page.

You can access this menu with this combination of D-pad presses on any model of Xbox after and including the Xbox 360.

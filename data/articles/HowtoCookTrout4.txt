 Pour the oil into a large skillet and warm it up using medium heat.

Canola oil works well, but you can also use sunflower oil or safflower oil. All three are good choices because they contribute very little additional taste and have a high smoke point.
Give the oil 1 or 2 minutes to become hot before pressing forward.
 After the oil becomes notably glossy, add the butter to the pan. Once it begins to sizzle, stir it into the hot oil already coating the pan.

Let the butter melt completely before moving to the next step.
You could also use margarine instead of butter, but butter will have a richer taste.
 Sprinkle a small amount of salt and pepper over both sides of each fish. A little will go a long way.

Brook trout has a slightly more delicate flavor than other types of trout, so many prefer to cook the trout in a way that brings out the flavor of the fish without adding many competing flavors. For that reason, you should avoid using too many herbs or spices when seasoning brook trout.
Use brook trout that has been cleaned, dried, and boned. You can remove the heads and tails or keep them on. Additionally, you can keep the scales and skin on, since the skin can be crispy and flavorful, especially when pan-fried.
 Once the trout turns light brown on the bottom side, carefully turn it over with a spatula and continue cooking on the other side.

Each side should only cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
Test the fish for doneness by flaking it with a fork. If the trout flakes apart easily and is opaque inside, the fish is done.
 Transfer the fish to a plate. Split the fish in half and serve.

Stick a fork into the area where the dorsal fin is. Lift and slide along the backbone area, splitting the fish apart and opening it up.
If you did not remove the bones before cooking the trout, splitting the fish open should reveal the bones. The bones should appear on one side and can be lifted out with your fingers.

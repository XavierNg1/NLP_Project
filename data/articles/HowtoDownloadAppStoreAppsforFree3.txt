 In order to use Zeusmos, your iDevice needs to be jailbroken. The method varies from version to version, but all jailbreaks should install Cydia, which is a program used to install jailbroken apps onto your device.


Jailbreaking your iPhone will void your warranty. If you need to send your device in for warranty service, you will need to restore it, which will reverse the jailbreak process.

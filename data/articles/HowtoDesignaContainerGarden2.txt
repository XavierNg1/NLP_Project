 These are groups of three colors that are all next to each other on the color wheel. For instance, red, red-orange and orange. Warm colors, like red and yellow, are bright, and look good with terra cotta or wood. Cool colors, like blue or lavender, look tranquil and go with terra cotta, stone, or other cool colored containers.The color wheel is a concept that is part of color theory, which consists of a circular diagram of colors.
 For a modern feel, choose pots that are monochromatic. Monochromatic colors are different shades of one color. If you want it to look more interesting, you can use a contrasting container.


For example, your entire scheme could be made up of different shades of blue -- sky blue, midnight blue, navy blue, etc.
Another example would be a range of purple shades. For instance, deep purple, indigo, lavender and lilac shades.
 They have a vibrant look, but if you want it to look subtler, use colors that are not as bright or contrasting.


For example, you could pair together shades of both yellow and purple. Yellow with dark purple would more dramatic than yellow with lavender.
Another complementary color scheme would be shades of both blue and orange.
 You can use any combination of colors you want. For example, you could coordinate red, white, and blue. Or you could use your favorite combination of colors. Whether it is purple and orange or black and white, you can be as colorful or as simple as you like.

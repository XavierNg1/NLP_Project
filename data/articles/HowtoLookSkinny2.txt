 Makeup can be used to create the appearance of depth or emphasize the best features of your face. For example, it can be used to create shadows under your cheekbones (making a fuller face appear slimmer) or to brighten lips (drawing attention away from a round jaw). These methods require skill and practice but can be very effective.


Be sure not to overuse makeup, as this can give you a plastic or unnatural appearance. Use foundation and cover-up only sparingly. Choose colors that are more natural in appearance, as bright colors and too much color will look clownish. Also, be sure to use colors that complement your clothing, hair, and skin.
 Get a tan to emphasize or create shadows and highlights on your body. This will make you look thinner and more fit.Where the shadows and highlights on clothing are difficult to control (which is why wearing black helps hide problem areas), you can control the shadows and highlights on your skin easily with skillful use of tanning products.


Don’t go overboard. Be careful in how you apply self-tanner to avoid streaks and be sure not to use too much. You don’t want an unnatural or orange appearance. The goal is to create shadows and highlights, which means that being an overall dark color will not help.
You may want to go to a tanning salon if you are inexperienced with tanning. Putting on self-tanner can be difficult and knowing where to put shadows and highlights takes time to learn. See how a professional does it first before trying it yourself.

 Save the third scoop for later. You will be using it as a garnish.
 If you don't like the taste of honey, you can use another sweetener instead, such as agave nectar.
 Try to use smooth almond butter if you can; this will cut down on the blending time and give you a smoother milkshake. If you'd like to cut down on the sweetness of the smoothie, use salted almond butter instead.
 From time to time, use a spatula to push the mixture down the sides of the blender or food processor. This will ensure that everything mixes evenly. You don't want any large chunks of almonds by the time you are done.
 You will need that space for the final scoop of ice cream!For a smaller serving, pour the milkshake into two smaller glasses instead.
 If you are making two smaller servings, then add two smaller scoops of ice cream into each glass. If you'd like, you can add a drizzle of honey on top for a final touch and boost of flavor.

You can choose from 15 game modes in total. They are organized under 3 main categories (Party Mode, Player Match and Ranked). Each game mode offers different missions.
Each game mode is configured by the host. Configurations include the types of vehicles, traffic amount, pedestrian count, weaponry and weather conditions within the game.
You cannot have more than 16 players within a single online game.
Online games are selected at random by either adding you onto an existing game or creating a new online game for you.
In Deathmatch, you will win $100 when you kill another player and lose $100 if you kill yourself.
The more money you earn by completing multi-player matches, the higher you rank. Higher ranks will unlock clothing for your character.

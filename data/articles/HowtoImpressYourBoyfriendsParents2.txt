 Ask your boyfriend some questions about his parents. What is their sense of humor like? Are there any topics that are off limits? What books, movies, or television shows do they like? What are their hobbies?Think of some questions you can ask based on your research. This will help the conversation flow and show that you are really interested in getting to know them.
 Don't show up to the meeting empty handed. A gift says that you appreciate being invited and that you are serious about their son. It also shows that you are a thoughtful person.The gift does not need to be large or expensive. Good gifts include:Fresh flowers in a small vase
A bottle of wine (if you are old enough)
A box of chocolates
A thank-you card

, When you meet his parents, smile and address them as Mr. and Mrs. Do not call his parents by their first name unless you are instructed to do so. This shows that you are respectful and have good manners.


Give his parents a hug or a handshake when you meet them. Follow his parents' lead during the greeting. If they extend their arms, go in for a hug.
Always show up on time. If you are running late, call and let them know.
 Practice good manners when you are around his parents. Say "please" and "thank you." Do not interrupt when someone else is talking. Give genuine compliments. If you like the food that was prepared or his mom's earrings, say so.Do not compliment just to flatter his parents and get on their good side. You do not want to be fake.
Let his parents know that you are happy to meet them and you appreciate their time/hospitality/kindness.Thank them for having you in their house, cooking you dinner, etc.You may say, "Thanks for everything. It was great meeting you. I hope to see you soon!"

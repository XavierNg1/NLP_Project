 You can use any design you like, but shorter nails may not show a larger design as well. Therefore, you might want to stick with a small design or something that has a repetitive pattern on it, such as polka dots or stripes.Try holding different designs up to your nails to get an idea of how much of your nails the strips will cover.
 Nail wraps often come in prints and intricate designs. However, if you want to create an even more interesting look, then you could pick out a few different patterns in coordinating colors.


For example, you could use pick a few different black and white designs and alternate the designs so you have a different one on each nail. Or, for a holiday look, you could pick out some red nail wraps and some green ones and alternate those.
 Different nail wrap brands have different specifications for application and removal. Always check the package instructions before applying or removing your nail wraps.


For example, some nail wraps can be removed by peeling them off with a cuticle pusher, while others require some acetone nail polish remover.
Ensure that you have everything you need to use the strips you purchase. For example, you might need a hairdryer, nail polish remover, and an orange tipped cuticle pusher to use some strips.

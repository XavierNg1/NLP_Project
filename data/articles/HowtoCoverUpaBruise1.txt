 To ensure good coverage of a bruise, start by applying a layer of concealer. Choose a concealer that is lighter than your natural skin tone and dab enough concealer onto the bruise to cover it entirely. Pat the concealer onto the bruise using a fingertip or makeup sponge. Then, blend it in well using your fingertips or the sponge.









You can also look for a concealer that has a yellow base to help offset the bluish color of the bruise.
If your bruise has other color tones, then a different type of concealer may work better. For example, you can use a green based concealer for red bruises, white based concealer for brown bruises, and lavender based for yellow bruises.;
, After you have covered the bruise with a layer of concealer, follow it up with a layer of foundation.This will help to even out the tone and provide more coverage. Use your fingertips or a makeup sponge to pat on the foundation and blend it in.









Apply the foundation over your whole face for best results. Do not just apply it to one cheek or one side of your face or there will be a noticeable difference in the color.
 This will also help to keep the makeup in place.









Apply the powder over your whole face as well. This will help to ensure that you have a uniform look.
You may need to reapply the powder throughout the day. Try taking the powder compact with you and check the makeup once every few hours.

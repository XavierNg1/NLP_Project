 If the mouthpiece is stuck, you can try to grip it with your hand and give it a little counter-clockwise twist. If it is not stuck too much, you will be able to pull it out with your hand.;
, Use a wooden mallet and give several little, fairly light taps around the mouthpipe (the insertion point where the mouthpiece goes in). This might help to loosen the connection between the mouthpiece and the instrument., Hold the instrument in one hand and hold the ends of the rope in your other hand. Give the rope a yank to see if the mouthpiece will come out.You can also wrap something around the rope, such as a mallet or other object, that will give you more leverage in pulling on the rope to remove the mouthpiece.
If the mouthpiece pops out, it might go flying across the room and hit the floor, putting it at risk for further damage.

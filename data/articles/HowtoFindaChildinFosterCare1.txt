 As the birth parent, you still have parental rights until a court terminates them.Accordingly, you should still receive updates about where the child is staying and how your child is doing. Go through your papers and look for the name of your child’s case worker.;
, Your first call should be to CPS to talk to the social worker or case worker assigned to your case.You can find the phone number for CPS by checking in your phone book or by looking online.


Identify yourself and ask to speak to your case worker. If you don’t have the name of your case worker, then just identify yourself and explain why you are calling.
 Once you are connected to CPS, you should ask for the name of the foster family. The case worker should give you the name, since there is generally no reason to keep it from you.


Indeed, you generally have a right to visitation with your child, so you should discuss a visitation schedule.However, CPS might not tell you the location of your child if it has concerns about the child’s safety.
 Even if your children are not with you right now, you should still stay as involved as possible. Your children definitely need your time, support, attention, and love.In addition, if you ever want to get your children back, then you need to show CPS that you are capable of parenting your children.


You also must complete all court-ordered services, including any drug or alcohol treatment plans. Keep necessary documents that show successful completion.
If you follow your services and maintain a close connection with your children, then you should be able to get them back.

 Most new cards are AGP 8x or PCI-Express. If you don't know, ask your computer's manufacturer.;
, For example, if you're a hardcore gamer, go for top of the line (~$500). If not, you could get almost as much performance for around $300. Since there are many different tests out there for determining which card is best, you'll have to pick one. The results are sometimes conflicting, and some people take issue with certain methodologies.
 If you're completely sure about which card you want, get it online! Shop based on features and GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) , not brand name. Two cards with exactly the same feature set and GPU (for example, the nVidia 7800 GT) can vary in price by over $50. The website referenced in step 2 has some pricing information as well, but shop around. Make sure you're buying from a reputable vendor.

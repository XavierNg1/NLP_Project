 Find GTA IV in the All Programs tab of the Start menu and click on it. If you have the game’s desktop shortcut, double-click on it there. On the game’s main screen, highlight “Start Game” with the mouse and press Enter.
 Once the game has started and you are standing in the virtual world, open the menu by pressing the Esc key and enter the map menu by pressing Enter.
 On the map, look for the nearest AMMU-NATION, the gun icon on the map. Once you find it, set a waypoint by right-clicking on the icon. A green line should appear showing you your route.


Exit the map by pressing Esc. Your GPS should be updated now on the bottom left of the screen.
 Follow the route marked by your GPS and either walk or drive to AMM-NATION. Walk through the front door of AMMU-NATION when you get there.
 As you walk around the room, you will notice various guns located around the room. When you have found the gun you want, simply walk up to it and press Enter to buy it.

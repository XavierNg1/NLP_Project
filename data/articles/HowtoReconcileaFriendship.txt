 Example: Did you insult your friend? Did she/he insult you? Do you feel that your friend doesn't like you anymore, or are you just tired of each other? To solve the problem, you must first assess the situation.;
, Obviously, landing up at her/his house at 2 a.m isn't the right choice, why not give your friend a call, or send a letter, or an email. With all this cool technology these days, there are at least a million options you could choose from.
 Apologize for any mistake. Present your views in a diplomatic manner, and even if she/he does not do so, you should refrain from screaming, swearing or others of the like. That is definitely not going to help!

, It's important for you to know what you have done wrong so you can correct your mistakes and lead a happy relationship!

, Don't immediately go back to your usual self. Take some time to mend your ways, they will do the same, and then you can resume your friendship!

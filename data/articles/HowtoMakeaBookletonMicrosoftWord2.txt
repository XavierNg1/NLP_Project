 Good booklet design has margins of at least 1/8-inch (0.125”) – you don’t want any text or photos bleeding off of the page. Expand the margins to 1/4-inch for a cleaner look.
, If you want four pictures going across each page, you’ll need four columns. You can type in the number of columns manually instead of choosing a Preset. You can alter the spacing and width of the columns as needed, but the default spacing should be okay for most layouts.
 Place your cursor in the first column (the one way to the left) and go to Page Layout (or Insert for Word 2003) – Breaks and choose Column. Your cursor should now be at the top of the next column. Keep inserting breaks as needed until each column is its own entity.
 Just click in each column and go to Insert –> Picture. You may want to use text boxes instead of typing directly into the column if you want your text to “float.”

,,, Have someone read over the text as well because the Spell Checker often misses a lot of mistakes.

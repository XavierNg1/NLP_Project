 Auditions are held in February and March at the beginning of each school year, or some are held at the beginning of term 2. The auditions are held at your school and the teacher that runs it at your school will give you the details. for the audition you will need to memorise 1 poem, the more expression you put into it the better!;
, Once everyone has auditioned the teacher will tell you who made the team in about a week later. Congratulations if you made the team! There is always next year if you didn't.
 The teacher will tell the team where and what time to meet for practises.
 You will be given the challenges in term 3, read and discuss them with your team members, then make a vote of what one you want to do.
 This will probably take a few TOM meetings, but it has to be creative and original.
 Work out with your team members who is doing what jobs. You will need to people writing and editing the script, two people working on the costumes and three people working on props and back drops.
 This is the day you have been waiting for! If you are in Australia then your TOM day will be at your states university, but don't worry your teacher will tell you everything. You have to come dressed in all black because that is like your base costume.
 You will all go into a room like a lecture room and there will be a marked out stage. You will put your costumes on over your black clothes, and the judges will say that your time has started. Quickly walk into the stage area and quickly set up your props and start. Remember you only have 10 minutes.
 You have just done your long term challenge!

, Go through with everything and remember to be spontaneous!

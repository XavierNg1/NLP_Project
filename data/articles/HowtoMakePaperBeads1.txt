 Cut long triangles out of magazines, coloured construction paper, wallpaper, etc. The base of the triangle will be the width of the bead and the longer the triangle is, the fatter the bead will become. The slender 1-inch (2.5cm) beads used in this method are made from 1-inch by 4-inch (2.5cm x 10cm) triangles, but 1/2-inch by 8-inch (1.27cm x 20cm) triangles would create fat 1/2-inch (1.27cm) beads. Cut accordingly..;
, Turn the triangle design-side down and apply a bit of glue to the pointy end. A glue stick or a tiny bit of liquid glue will do.
 Starting at the wide end, roll the triangle around itself using a dowel, toothpick, or bamboo skewer. For a symmetrical spiral, keep the triangle centered as you roll; for a more free-form look, allow the triangle to become slightly off-centered.


Roll tightly, especially if you want the beads to last. Try to avoid having space between the layers.
 If the bead doesn’t stay tightly rolled up, apply another dab of glue. Hold it for a moment to help the glue to set.
 Use a finish like Marvin Medium, ModPodge, Diamond Glaze, or a solution of one part clear-drying glue to two parts water. Let it dry thoroughly, making sure it doesn’t stick to anything. You might shove a toothpick into a pincushion or a piece of Styrofoam to allow it to dry completely. Add multiple coats for a glossier, longer-lasting finish.
 Wait several hours until your clear finish has set on the bead. Slide the bead off the end of the dowel. If it is well wrapped and glued, it will hold. If the bead begins to unravel, replace it on your skewer and add more glue and finish where necessary.
 Use the aforementioned directions to create as many beads as you would like to finish your project. Make several for jewelry pieces, or create a long string to use for decoration in your home.

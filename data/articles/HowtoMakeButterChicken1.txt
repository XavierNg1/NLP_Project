Begin by seasoning the chicken with a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper.;
,


Using a large frying pan, heat the vegetable oil and add the chicken.



Fry the chicken for 3-4 minutes until it turns a golden-brown colour.



Take the chicken out of the frying pan and put it aside.



Use the same frying pan to melt the butter.



Now add the onion and cinnamon and fry together in the pan.



At this point add the crushed garlic, crushed ginger, turmeric, chilli powder, almonds, peeled tomatoes, tomato paste and the natural yoghurt. Stir all of the ingredients together and mix thoroughly.



Bring the ingredients to a boil and stir for 4-5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.



Put the chicken back into the pan and combine with the other ingredients.



To complement the flavors in the dish, add the coriander (or fresh spinach if you prefer) and mix with the sauce.



Spoon the chicken and the sauce onto a large serving dish and serve with rice and Naan bread. A perfect curry dish that goes down well with an icy Asian beer.

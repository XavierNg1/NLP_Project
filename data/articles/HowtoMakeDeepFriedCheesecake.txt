 You can use a store-bought cheesecake or one you've prepared yourself.;
, A regular sized cheesecake will give you around 25-30 pieces.
 Simply mix one egg with a cup of milk until combined.
 If you get extra egg wash on the spring roll wrappers, use a napkin or paper towel to soak it up.
 Lay out the spring roll wrapper and place one piece of cheesecake in the middle of each wrapper.







Gently roll each piece of wrapped cheesecake until it is completely rolled up.
 Use the deep-frying pan and put about 3 inches (7.5cm) of vegetable oil in the pan and heat to 375ºF/190ºC. To test whether the oil is ready or not, stick the corner of a wrapped cheesecake in the heated oil. If the oil is ready, it will sizzle.
, Use tongs to remove them and proceed to the next step for each piece while they're still hot.
 After the cheesecake pieces have been in the pan for 10 seconds, use your tongs to place the hot fried cheesecake pieces into a bowl of cinnamon sugar. Coat them well and place them aside to let them cool off.
 The fried cheesecake pieces go well with a range of toppings, including ice-cream, caramel, hot fudge, or strawberry sauce. Whipped cream is also a good accompaniment.

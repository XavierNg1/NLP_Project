 That might sound heretical, but sometimes black and white can be so much more striking than color...think Ansel Adams. Textures and patterns will jump out at your viewer much more readily.;
, This may be something you are already doing, but try doing it consciously. This will help liven your shot by adding color to it.
 Maybe you have flowers in the house, or you have some flowers at the table or something like that. This particular shot is a fuchsia set in a martini glass on top of a glass sheet.
 With film, that is much more easily done, but if using digital, use software to create the same effect.
 Make it so its hard to tell that you are looking at a flower. Odd angles and perspectives can help with that.
 You can shoot flowers on or in the water, or you can set something up inside your studio.
, That will take some work and preparation on your part, but can open up a whole new photographic field for you!

, Get a nice fast lens, get out there and find an insect doing its thing with the flower. Be sure your camera is set to macro.
 Get on the ground and shoot straight at the flower/plant, or if the plant is big enough, get under it and shoot up into the sun or sky.
 A quote from Jurassic Park, "Life will find a way" and it's true. Grass, dandelions and trees have been known to find their way through concrete and asphalt.
, Add it to someone's ear, put it in a portrait, or however you can think of it.

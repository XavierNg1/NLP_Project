 You will likely already see the expression written this way. If not, change it. Solving the problem as a fraction makes it easier to follow all the necessary steps, especially when factoring the square roots. Recall that a fraction bar is also a division bar.For example, if you are calculating 8÷36{\displaystyle {\sqrt {8}}\div {\sqrt {36}}}, rewrite the problem like this: 836{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {8}}{\sqrt {36}}}}.
 Factor the number as you would any whole number. Keep the factors under the radical signs.For example:836=2×2×26×6{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {8}}{\sqrt {36}}}={\frac {\sqrt {2\times 2\times 2}}{\sqrt {6\times 6}}}}


, To  simplify a square root, pull out any factors that make a perfect square. A perfect square is the result of a whole number multiplied by itself.The factor will now become a coefficient outside of the square root.

For example: 2×2×26×6{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {{\cancel {2\times 2\times }}2}}{\sqrt {\cancel {6\times 6}}}}} 226{\displaystyle {\frac {2{\sqrt {2}}}{6}}}So, 836=226{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {8}}{\sqrt {36}}}={\frac {2{\sqrt {2}}}{6}}} 


, As a rule, an expression cannot have a square root in the denominator. If your fraction has a square root in the denominator, you need to rationalize it. This means to cancel out the square root in the denominator. To do this, multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the square root you need to cancel.For example, if your expression is 623{\displaystyle {\frac {6{\sqrt {2}}}{\sqrt {3}}}}, you need to multiply the numerator and denominator by 3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {3}}} to cancel the square root in the denominator:623×33{\displaystyle {\frac {6{\sqrt {2}}}{\sqrt {3}}}\times {\frac {\sqrt {3}}{\sqrt {3}}}}=62×33×3{\displaystyle ={\frac {6{\sqrt {2}}\times {\sqrt {3}}}{{\sqrt {3}}\times {\sqrt {3}}}}}=669{\displaystyle ={\frac {6{\sqrt {6}}}{\sqrt {9}}}}=663{\displaystyle ={\frac {6{\sqrt {6}}}{3}}}.
 Sometimes you will be left with coefficients that can be simplified, or  reduced. Simplify the whole numbers in the numerator and denominator as you would simplify any fraction.

For example, 26{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{6}}} reduces to 13{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}}, so 226{\displaystyle {\frac {2{\sqrt {2}}}{6}}} reduces to 123{\displaystyle {\frac {1{\sqrt {2}}}{3}}}, or simply 23{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {2}}{3}}}.

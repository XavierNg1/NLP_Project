 Each state has its own laws that keep creditors or other plaintiffs from enforcing a judgement against certain types of assets.


Typically, personal property such as clothes and household furniture is exempt, as well as tools of a trade or business. For example, if you are a graphic designer or programmer, an asset such as your computer generally would be considered exempt.Some states such as Texas even prohibit garnishment of your wages to satisfy a legal judgment., If you have significant cash assets, you may be able to protect at least a portion by putting it in an IRA or other type of retirement account that is protected from lawsuits by federal or state law.


Protection for IRAs and other qualified retirement plans applies only in bankruptcy, not to judgments in other courts. ERISA plans are protected from all judgments except qualified domestic relations orders and IRS tax levies.Many states have laws that protect certain retirement accounts, annuities, and life insurance from court judgments, but this is a matter of state law and varies widely., Many states prohibit creditors or other plaintiffs from taking the home where you live.


Some states offer unlimited protection, while others limit the homestead exemption to a certain amount of equity. What law applies depends on where the property is located and whether you keep it as your primary residence.For example, if you live in Texas, you cannot be forced to sell your home to satisfy a court judgment, regardless of how much the home is worth. Limited exceptions include property division during a divorce or if you are sued by a lender and your obligation was secured by your house, such as a with a mortgage or home improvement loan., If you have additional property not covered by homestead or other exemptions, you can take out a loan and secure the loan's proceeds in a protected account.For example, suppose you live in a state where annuities are protected from legal judgments and you own an apartment building. You can take out a loan against the building's equity and put the proceeds from the loan into an annuity, thus shielding that asset from judgment.

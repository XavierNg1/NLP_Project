 You are likely to undergo group therapy in inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation. Continue group therapy if you find it beneficial. The social sharing can help ease the sense of isolation common during recovery, and the presence of a counselor can help guide the conversation in helpful directions.
 Check out local chapters of Narcotics Anonymous and SMART Recovery. NA uses a 12-step process that prioritizes surrender to a higher power, self-identification as an addict, and actions that acknowledge this identity, while SMART relies more on cognitive and behavioral adjustments.

, Behavioral therapists can help you unlearn the associations that lead you to take opiates. They help you recognize the moods, actions, and thought patterns that lead to relapse. They can also train you in stress management, relaxation, and problem-solving.
 While psychotherapy cannot replace a comprehensive opiate addiction treatment plan, it can support it by helping you deal with mental health issues that may be interfering with your recovery efforts. Depression, anxiety, and PTSD are often comorbid with addiction.
 Your addiction is a part of the lives of those around you, and your journey to recovery will have a powerful effect on those lives. To repair and maintain your relationships, and to give your loved ones a chance to heal and confront their emotions, ask your loved ones to join you in family counseling.


Ask your family to check out a NA family meeting, or an online SMART recovery meeting.

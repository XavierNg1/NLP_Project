 Be diligent about regularly checking your bank statements to make sure no unauthorized transactions have been made using your card. Most banks will contact you if they suspect any transactions are fraudulent, but it's always a good idea to check your statements personally and on a regular basis. If possible, check your account online rather than waiting for paper statements., Tell them immediately if you think that there is anything that may compromise your PIN, such as an easy PIN, other ID in your wallet making it easy to work out or, horror of all horrors, the PIN being written down somewhere in the wallet or on the card. Get the bank to cancel the card immediately., If you suspect any fraudulent activity using a card still in your possession, apart from notifying the bank and the police, have your PIN changed immediately.

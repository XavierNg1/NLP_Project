 Hold it the same way you would a banana, gripping the bottom with one hand and holding the stem with the other. If the plantain has turned brown and is fully ripe, the peel should come off easily.
 The peel should begin to come off in one long strip. Completely remove the first strip with your hands.
 Once the first strip is loose, the rest follows easily. Pull off the entire peel and discard it. The plantain is now ready to use.

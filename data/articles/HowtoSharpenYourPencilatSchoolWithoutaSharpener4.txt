 If your pencil tip breaks off completely, you may be out of luck and won't be able to restore it to a point. The best way to handle a broken pencil is off course to have spare pencils available.


The smartest strategy for dealing with a broken pencil is to not have to try to sharpen it, and to always carry at least a couple more than you think you will need.
 If you can't get to the pencil sharpener, you may be able to draw upon the pity of a fellow classmate. You may even be able to get someone to offer you a spare pencil without having to talk: simply sigh and hold up the broken tip. With luck, someone near you will notice and will be willing to hand you an extra.


Take care not to make your situation worse, though, by speaking during an exam or important assignment. You don't want to get in even worse trouble or get your friend in hot water by forcing them to talk to you. You'll both risk failing the test or assignment.
 If you have a tendency to break pencils or if you dull the point quickly because you press down firmly when writing or drawing, you can avoid creating problems for yourself by constantly asking to get up and use the sharpener by keeping your own in your desk or pocket.


You can purchase mini sharpeners at any office supply store or big-box store like Target or Walmart. You can also use a make-up sharpener (usually designed to sharpen eye and lip liners).
 So long as you aren't taking a standardized test which requires you to use a pencil, you may be able to switch to a pen or even crayon to complete your work. With luck, your instructor will understand.

 Selling them to Retail will get you money fast! Try to also get your hands on tools from Timmy and Tommy Nook, prices ranging at 200 - 500 bells for tools. Catching rare bugs, fish, or finding the money rock or ores can get you thousands easily.;
, Foreign fruit is sold for more at Retail than your native fruit.


At the island, there is a lot of foreign fruit that you will not see anywhere else! Collect it and take it back. Don't worry, it grows back.
 You can sell the foreign fruit to Retail. You can also catch beetles at night (they range from 6,000 to 12,000 bells) and sharks (8,000 to 15,000). Selling them would get you tons of bells!


Also, once you get to the island, you can buy a wetsuit. A wetsuit allows you to go into the water, and catch sea creatures (crabs, seaweed, things that are not fish)

, Perfect fruit will grow on your native fruit trees, and it will look shiny, sparkly or different from the normal fruit. You can plant it for more perfect fruit, sell it, or eat it (not recommend to eat it) It can be sold for a big number (600 Bells each for a native fruit and 3,000 Bells each for a non-native fruit).
 One rock in your town will be a money rock. Hit it multiple times and money should come out! The money rock will change every day. Memorize the rocks that your town started with, because the ore rock will be one that you haven't seen before. Hit that new rock with your shovel, and it will blast open. You will see an ore which can be sold within the price range of 1,000 bells to 4,000 bells.
 Each day when you refresh your town, you'll get 5,000 bells! So each day you'll make 5,000 bells for only 1 minute worth of work. Easy-peasy!

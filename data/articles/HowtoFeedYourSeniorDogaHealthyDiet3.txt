Older dogs may not produce enough, which is why you need to make sure it's added to their food.Other fatty acids, such as DHA and EPA, can also be helpful to your dog, particularly if your dog has joint problems. Talk to your vet about adding supplements if your dog's food doesn't provide these nutrients already.
 Like humans, dogs sometimes need a little help growing helpful bacteria in their bodies. FOS is a substance that can help encourage that growth, which is particularly important in older dogs., You've probably heard that antioxidants are an important part of your diet. Unsurprisingly, they're an important part of your dog's diet, too. They reduce free radicals in the body, which helps your dog look and feel younger, plus it can help your dog fight off disease., For example, if your dog has kidney problems, they will likely require a diet with lower phosphorus, protein, and altered sodium. Other issues that may require a special diet include heart disease and diabetes. There are many diets available that are formulated specifically for dogs with health problems. If you think your dog may benefit from one of these diets, talk to your vet.

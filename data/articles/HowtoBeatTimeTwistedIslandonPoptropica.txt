A lady is standing outside of "Pendulum's Lab" crying. Click on her. She will talk about your mission, when she goes into "Pendulum's Lab", follow her.

If you want to learn more about the future machine, talk to the man that's wearing glasses and an apron.
To power up the future machine, walk to your left and down the slope, then to your right again. There will be an arrow on the wall and a large mechanism right beside it. Push the mechanism until it can't go any farther, the future machine should be running by now(every time you want to go into the future, you'll have to power it up again).
Walk back to the door of the future machine, which will be pulsing blue, and click on it to enter.
The future will be in ruins. There will be an older version of yourself standing there. Talk to him/her and they will give you a hand held time machine that looks like a golden stopwatch. See tips for the use of it.
There will also be a sign in the future that says " It wasn't supposed to be this way! Something happened in the past that ruined mankind's future. Can you turn back the hands of time and make things right?"
You can travel to the different times and places in any order you want. The items people need will be hidden somewhere else in time. See tips for who needs what, where items are, and what special outfits you can get.;

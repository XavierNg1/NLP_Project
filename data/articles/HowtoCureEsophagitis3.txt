 The allergic reaction causes your esophagus to become inflamed and damaged.


Steroid medication helps to reduce or eliminate unnecessary immune reactions such as occurs with eosinophilic esophagitis.
Similarly to how inhaled steroids are used to treat asthma, "topical oral steroids" are thought to coat the surface of your GI tract in a way that prevents irritation.The other advantage of "topical oral steroids" is that they are not absorbed into your bloodstream, so you avoid the typical side effects of steroid medications., In order to determine the "culprit food," it is recommended to remove suspicious foods from your diet (your doctor can tell you which foods are most likely to be culprits), and to add them back in slowly, monitoring for any reactions or signs of heartburn.It is important to add back only one food at a time, otherwise you will not be able to tell which one caused you symptoms of heartburn.
 For infectious esophagitis, medications will be prescribed according to the organism causing the infection.If it is yeast Candida, the treatment is fluconazole or an echinocandin. The chosen medication depends on the strain of Candida and on the individual patient, including how ill he or she is, whether other illnesses are also present, allergies, and other factors.
If the patient has a viral esophagitis, acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir will be prescribed. Again, the particular choice depends on the patient and on the virus.
If it is caused by a bacteria, antibiotics will be prescribed.

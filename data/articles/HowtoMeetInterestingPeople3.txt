 Look through local continuing education programsâ€™ offerings and pick a topic or a skill that interests you. You can be confident that other students will share this interest with you.


Language classes can put you in contact with people from various backgrounds. Talking to fellow students could introduce you to interesting people that you may not have realized were around you.
Be aware of the interests that are popular in your area. If you enjoy line dancing, but moved to a city where country music is less popular, consider a swing dancing class.
Some hobbies are more social than others. If your goal is to meet people, invest your efforts into activities that involve cooperation and conversation.
 If you enjoy being active or competitive, a local recreational team will put you in contact with like-minded people. Joining a bowling league will put you in contact with other enthusiastic bowlers. Likewise, a hiking club will connect you to hikers with interesting stories.
 If you are looking for intellectual stimulation, look for a local group that meets periodically to discuss a selected book. Check the offerings of your local library, book store events, or look through the options listed on Meetup.com.
 Meet people that share your passion for an organization or cause while you make a difference in your community. VolunteerMatch.org is a good place to start exploring volunteer options in your area.
 You may want to meet interesting people who share your interests, but you may also find a group of people that will help you stretch your interests. It will be easier to meet interesting people if you expand what interests you. Now is a good time to learn new cooking skills, try a new sport, or read a type of literature that you have not yet explored.

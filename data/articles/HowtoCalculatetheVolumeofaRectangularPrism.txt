 The length is the longest side of the flat surface of the rectangle on the top or bottom of the rectangular prism.


Ex: Length = 5 in.;
, The width is the shorter side of the flat surface of the rectangle on the top or bottom of the rectangular prism.


Ex: Width = 4 in.
 The height is the part of the rectangular prism that rises up. Imagine that the height is what stretches up a flat rectangle until it becomes a three-dimensional shape.


Ex: Height = 3 in.
 You can multiply them in any order to get the same different result. The formula for finding the volume of a rectangular prism is the following: Volume = Length * Height * Width, or V = L * H * W.


Ex: V = 5 in. * 4 in. * 3 in. = 60 in.
 Since you're calculating volume, you're working in a three-dimensional space. Just take your answer and state it in cubic units. Whether you're working in feet, inches, or centimeters, you should state your answer in cubic units.


60 will become 60 in3.

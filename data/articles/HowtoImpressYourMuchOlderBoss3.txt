 Pay attention to how your boss and coworkers dress and then dress a step above everyone else. For example, if everyone is wearing jeans and t-shirts, then you would wear a nice pair of jeans and a button down shirt or blouse. This will help your boss take you more seriously.Be careful not to completely out dress your boss and coworkers. If you work in a casual office, do not wear a suit to work. Always dress appropriately for your office culture.
 As a younger worker, you will be surrounded by people with more experience and knowledge. Your boss needs to see that you are well-informed and can keep up with your coworkers. Read your companyâ€™s website, social media pages, and news releases.Continue to do this even after you are hired. Set aside time each week to read about the field you are working in.
You can also read any websites or publications that are related to your field and profession.
 Pay attention to the time that people come to and leave work. How long are usual lunch breaks? Do people collaborate on work or work silently on their own?For example, if you are supposed to get off at 5:00 pm, but notice that people tend to leave around 5:15 pm, stick around until 5:30 pm. You do not want to be the first out of the door at 5:00 pm on the dot.
You do not want to stand out for the wrong reasons. Adjust your work style so that you fit in with the culture.
If you notice any negative traits such as excessive lunch breaks or socializing too much, do not engage in those. For example, if people tend to have 30 minute conversations that are not related to work, chat for about 5 minutes and then return to your work. You are still socializing without hurting your work performance.

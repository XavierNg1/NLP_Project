 But for people with dry skin, exfoliators can be harsh and drying for the skin. Instead, just gently massage your skin in circular motions with a washcloth to remove dead skin cells before using your daily gentle cleanser and moisturiser.
 For dry kin, look up homemade face mask recipes or buy a hydrating, moisturising and preferably natural one (Lush have great face masks for all the different skin types!). Common ingredients for homemade face masks for dry skin can include honey, oils, bananas, yogurt, milk and sometimes butter and chocolate.
 Plus, you'll be getting the benefit of eating healthily if you eat some of the foods mentioned to help dry skin!

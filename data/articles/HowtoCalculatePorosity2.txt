 The particle density of a sample is equal to the mass of the sample divided by volume of the sample. When dealing with soil samples, the average particle density of soil is 2.66 g/(cm^3). For that reason, this value is assumed to be the particle density of any soil sample, unless otherwise specified., Since density is defined as mass per volume, and porosity is a comparison of pore volume to total volume, it is possible to express porosity in terms of density as well. The result is the equation Pt{\displaystyle Pt} = (1 - Pb{\displaystyle Pb}/Pd{\displaystyle Pd}) where Pt{\displaystyle Pt} is your porosity, Pb{\displaystyle Pb} is the bulk density, and Pd{\displaystyle Pd} is the sample’s particle density., The Pb{\displaystyle Pb} value will be given to you in a straightforward question. If the value is not given, you may be given other values such as the dry mass of the sample and the sample’s volume. In this case you would divide the dry mass of the sample by the sample volume to find your bulk density, or Pb{\displaystyle Pb}., Now that you have obtained values for Pb{\displaystyle Pb} and Pd{\displaystyle Pd}, you can solve for Pt{\displaystyle Pt}. Note that the value obtained by dividing Pb{\displaystyle Pb} by Pd{\displaystyle Pd} should ALWAYS be less than 1, thus the equation Pt{\displaystyle Pt} = (1 - Pb{\displaystyle Pb}/Pd{\displaystyle Pd}) should never yield a negative answer. If it does, you likely divided Pd{\displaystyle Pd} by Pb{\displaystyle Pb}, which is incorrect.This equation will give you a decimal value for porosity. To express porosity as a percent, simply multiply that decimal by 100%. For example, 0.41 x 100% = 41%.

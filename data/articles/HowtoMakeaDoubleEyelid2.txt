 Much like eyelid tape, eyelid glue may be difficult to find in some stores, but should be easy to find online. Unlike eyelid tape, you can't really make your own.


There are several brands of eyelid glue, most of which come from Japan. Find the one that works for you., Wash your face and clean your eye area. Wait for your eyes to dry completely before applying the glue.Once the glue dries you can apply make-up.
 Your eyelid glue should come with a "pusher" to help you find your eyelid crease. If you don't have such a tool, you can use the glue brush instead.Close your eye and run the "pusher" along your eyelid to find the desired crease line. This is where you will apply the glue., Wipe away any excess glue from the brush. Try to use just enough glue to secure your eyelid. If you have too much glue on the brush, you run the risk of getting glue in your eye., Close your eye and carefully run the brush along the desired crease line. Use the "pusher" to fold the eyelid up and onto the glue. Open your eye to make the glue stick.Using glue looks more natural, but may wear off quickly. Reapply as necessary.

 Sensitive skin does not respond well to scrubs or acidic cleansers.


People with sensitive skin should try the product on 1 small area of the face and use it only if it does not produce irritation.










Place a soft terry cloth washcloth under a warm tap. Squeeze the washcloth and place it on your face for 1 to 2 minutes. Warm water will open the pores, making it easier to exfoliate.
 Rub the soap on the middle portion of the cloth.









Depending upon the cleanser, this may or may not produce a lather.
 Start at the nose, move to the forehead and continue around the rest of your face.









Use a gentle touch. Exfoliation does not require hard scrubbing.
 Pat it dry.



This process may produce some redness, which will go away within a few hours. People who are prone to redness should exfoliate at night, giving their skin time to calm while they sleep.
If you have extremely dry skin, apply a thin coat of moisturizing oil 5 minutes prior to exfoliation.

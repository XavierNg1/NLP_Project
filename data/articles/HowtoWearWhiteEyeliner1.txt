 This will help the look last longer, as well as deter smudging. If the primer is wet, such as a liquid or gel, allow it to dry., Apply your base shade across the eyelid and two-thirds of the way up to your eyebrow. Apply a second, darker shade in the crease at the outer corner of your eye to create a sideways “V.”For example, try applying a sparkly nude shade as your base color, and a shimmery chocolate for the accent color.
 Color about a centimeter out from the inner corner of your eyes towards your top and bottom lids, creating an inner “V” for each eye. This will help your eyes appear larger and brighter., You can line your upper lids with a darker shade of liner by itself, or line them with white followed by a darker color.
 Use a matte white eyeshadow pencil or thin crayon to carefully line your lower waterline. Brush the line with an eyeshadow brush to soften its appearance.To apply white to your waterline, gently hold down the skin under your eyes with one hand. Use the other hand to color back and forth on the waterline with your liner, taking care not to slip and poke your eye., Hold your upper lid up gently as you draw white liner on your upper water line. Release your lid and dot spaces to fill in between your lashes.This technique can give you the appearance of fuller upper lashes.
 Use mascara on your upper and/or lower lashes, if desired.

If your hair is dry, you can add in a splash of coconut oil to condition your hair at the same time.Work the juice into your hair thoroughly. When you finish, wrap your hair in a towel or shower cap and let the juice sit for about an hour. Wear older clothing while you wait, as these juices can stain easily.Rinse the juice out after an hour.

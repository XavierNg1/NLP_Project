 Revision is maybe the most important part of writing, as this is where you assess your work and make it better. Do not be afraid to revise and edit your first drafts. Be merciless and trim away any excess or unnecessary moments. Be willing to rip the draft apart and rewrite parts of it until it is at its best.A popular approach is to “kill your darlings,” where you remove sentences or sections that you like a little too much. Look for sections where the prose seems awkward or does not flow well. Revise them until they feel seamless and easy to follow.
 Flowery prose often contains too many adjectives and adverbs. It can also be confusing for a reader to follow and have one too many metaphors or similes. Read over your writing and identify any sentences with more than one adjective or adverb. Ask yourself if you can simplify the sentence and remove descriptions that are unnecessary or confusing.For example, rather than have a sentence like, “She leapt quickly and wildly over the wide, thick, dark river,” you may revise it to read, “She leapt wildly over the wide, dark river.”

, Make sure all of the words in your writing are spelled correctly. Having correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in your writing will ensure the reader does not get lost or confused. It will also show the reader that you put care and effort into your writing.To check for misspelled words, try reading the story backwards. This will allow you to look at each word to confirm it is correct.

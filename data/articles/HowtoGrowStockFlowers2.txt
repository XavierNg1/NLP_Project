 The flowers can tolerate slightly dry conditions, but once the soil becomes dry to a depth of 2 inches (5 cm), the flowers likely need another watering. During dry periods, the soil should be lightly watered once or twice a week. If you get rain at least once a week, however, additional watering may not be necessary.


Avoid drenching stock flowers. Sopping wet soil leads to soggy roots, and soggy roots lead to unhappy and unhealthy stocks.
 Weeds compete for nutrients, and too many weeds can cause your stock flowers to wither. Yank the weeds up, removing them in their entirety, roots and all. Doing so rids the plant bed of weeds more effectively than merely snipping them off at surface level does.


Alternatively, you can apply a light layer of mulch around flowers to help suffocate below-ground weeds before they have the chance to sprout., As the weather warms, the blossoms will begin to wilt. Snip the flowers off just below the head to prevent them from going to seed. Deadheading the flowers also encourages more blossoms to grow before the plant dies off in the heat of the summer.
 Moths are occasionally attracted to stock flowers, but otherwise, the plants are not especially prone to pest problems.

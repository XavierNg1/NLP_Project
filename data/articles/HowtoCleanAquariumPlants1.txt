 Wash your hands thoroughly. Next, gently rub the algae off of plants while the plants are still in the aquarium. Remove any algae that you’ve rubbed off from the aquarium.


Once you have clean plants, maintain their cleanliness on a weekly basis by rubbing the algae off them while they are in the aquarium.;
, If the algae doesn’t come off easily in the water, remove the plant you’re cleaning from the aquarium. Check for any fish, snails, or other creatures that might be attached to the plants. Put the plant in a sink, bathtub, or similar container. Gently place those back in the aquarium.Don’t remove all of the plants at once. This could cause stress for your fish.
 After removing the plant from the aquarium, use a clean toothbrush or an aquarium-safe algae pad to remove debris that won’t come off with your finger. Gently scrub all parts of the plant. Fold the algae pad if needed to get into smaller crevices of the plant. Rinse all algae off the plant with clean water before returning it to the aquarium.Keep a separate toothbrush that is dedicated to cleaning your fish tank plants. Never clean your aquarium plants with a toothbrush that has been used for any other purpose.

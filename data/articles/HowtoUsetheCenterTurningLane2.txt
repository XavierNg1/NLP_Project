 On a two-lane street this won’t be an issue. But if there is more than one lane of traffic going in the same direction, merge into the left lane. , This will signal to other drivers that you are about to enter the center turn lane. , Remember: the center turn lane is used by traffic going in both directions. You need to look for oncoming cars as well as cars going in your direction. , When you see that the coast is clear, decelerate and ease your car into the center turn lane. , Unless there is no traffic coming in the opposite direction, you’ll have to stop before you make your left turn. Wait until there is a gap in the traffic before you attempt your turn. Also watch out for traffic pulling onto the main road from side roads.
 Accelerate at a normal pace. Once you begin the turn you will be in a lane of oncoming traffic, so don’t stop once you’ve started your turn.

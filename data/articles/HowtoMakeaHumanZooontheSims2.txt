 Make a big box with no door, windows, but in the middle there must be a staircase. Make sure it is not touching the walls. You can put paint on the walls, but the Sims will enjoy it more. You now have the base of your zoo.;
, You can put created Sims in or random Sims that walk in from the neighborhood. Random Sims are better because they all contrast. This guide shows it for random Sims but you can edit the steps to fit your style.
 Weird, but it helps. Give him a small, cheap apartment with some creature comforts, who says it has to look good?

, People will come to greet him, including your other Sims if you have any. Make sure the MoveObjects on cheat is turned on, then once you see somebody walking near your house, pause your game, click on them, and move them to the zoo. The mailmen always escape somehow, so don't even bother putting them in.
 Ignore them. Once a week, let another Sim from the zoo live with Zoey (if they develop a strong relationship with him, move them in to a nicer apartment) to experience creature comforts and then throw her back in to the zoo. Put one plate of food in the zoo once a day. Put the cheapest bed in but only one and it's only for once a week. No toilets or sofas or anything. It's cruel, but it's life.
 This is optional. Make a small box (as in tiny, not much bigger than the Sim) and if somebody gets on your nerves by giving you so many messages, put them there. They will die in a short time.
 Dogs like Rover and Spot will come more often if Zoey has a dog. Call the dog Bleh. Same with cats, but call your cat Cindercra. Tried and tested method, this zoo worked better with these names so just follow the steps.
 Let him do his job unless there is someone you want to save, then take them to Zoey's bed. They will heal.
 Call the adult Bobette.

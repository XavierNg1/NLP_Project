 Then, add 0 to the end of the product. The result is 20 times the other product.For example, to calculate 20×17{\displaystyle 20\times 17}, you would calculate 17×2=34{\displaystyle 17\times 2=34}. Then, adding a 0 to the end of the product (34), you have 17×20=340{\displaystyle 17\times 20=340}.
 Halving 20 means dividing it by 2, which gives you 10. To double the other factor, multiply it by 2. The product of these two new factors gives you the product of the original two factors.For example, if you are calculating 20×12{\displaystyle 20\times 12}, you would halve the 20 to 10, and multiply 12 by 2: 12×2=24{\displaystyle 12\times 2=24}. So, the new multiplication is 10×24=240{\displaystyle 10\times 24=240}. So, 20×12=240{\displaystyle 20\times 12=240}


, Then, double the product by multiplying it by 2. This gives you the product of the other factor and 20.

For example, to calculate 20×18{\displaystyle 20\times 18}, you would first calculate 18×10=180{\displaystyle 18\times 10=180}. Then, calculate 180×2=360{\displaystyle 180\times 2=360}. So, 20×18=360{\displaystyle 20\times 18=360}.

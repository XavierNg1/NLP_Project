 Find an old eyeshadow (or buy a cheap one) in the form of either loose or compacted powder, rather than a gel form. Scoop the eyeshadow into a bowl and use the back of a spoon to mash it up until you've got a fine, lump-free powder.


To give the lipstick some shimmer, try adding a little shimmering eyeshadow to the main color you have chosen.
Using eyeshadow is a great way to experiment with interesting lipstick colors. Eyeshadows are like color pigments so that's why we use it. Go for green, blue, black, and other colors that are difficult to find in lipstick shades.
Note that some eyeshadows are not safe for use on your lips, however. Check the ingredients. If the eyeshadow includes ultramarines, ferric ferrocyanide, and/or chromium oxides, do not use it. Only use eyeshadows that contain safe iron oxides., Place about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of petroleum jelly in a microwave-safe bowl. Add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of eyeshadow powder. Place the bowl in the microwave and heat it until it melts and becomes runny, then stir it up to distribute the color throughout the jelly.








Add more powder if you want the eyeshadow to have a more saturated hue. (Darker/Opaque)
Add less powder for a tinted lipgloss look. (Lighter/Translucent)
Instead of petroleum jelly, you can substitute clear chapstick.
 Use an old lipstick or chapstick tube, a cosmetics pot, or any other container with a lid. Let the mixture harden before you use it.

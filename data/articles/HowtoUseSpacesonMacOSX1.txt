 In order to begin to understand how the concept of Spaces works, you'll need to open the Mission Control screen. This shows you the spaces you have activeâ€”each of the numbered desktops at the top of the screen represents a space. There are three different ways to access Mission Control:


Press the "F3" key.
Click on the "Mission Control" icon on your dock.
If you have a trackpad, push upwards on the pad with three fingers.;
, To move an active program to its own space, simply drag it with the mouse and drop it on the chosen space.


To open up an additional desktop space from Mission Control, move your mouse towards the top-right of the screen. A "+" sign will appear. Click it, and an additional space will open, up to the total limit of 16 spaces.






To remove an open desktop space, move your mouse the the space at the top of the Mission control screen, and click the "x" that appears in the top left. If you have any open programs on the space that you close, they will be automatically moved to your first space.
 When you click on a space, Mission Control will disappear and your display will show only the space you selected.

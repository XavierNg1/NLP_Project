 You can find such markers in a variety of wood tones at a home improvement or hardware store. Apply the marker only to the scratch itself. If any of the color gets on the finished surfaces, wipe it off immediately.
 Do not use herbal or green tea; the black tea produces the color you want to match the wood.

Place the tea bag in a cup and pour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of hot water over it.






Let it steep for at least 2 minutes. If your wood is very dark, use a black tea bag that has been steeped for at least 3 minutes. The longer the bag is steeped, the darker the color.






Dip a cotton swab into the tea and dab it on the scratch.






Use a paper towel to immediately wipe away any tea that gets on the surrounding wood so that it doesnâ€™t get stained.


Add 1 tablespoon (28 g) of coffee granules to a small bowl and add just enough hot water to make a thick paste.






Rub the paste into the scratch, taking care not to get the paste on the surrounding wood.






Wipe away any excess with a dry cloth.

 Be sure your guinea pig isn't allergic to the type of bedding you are giving it or you might hurt its health. Set a budget so that you know how often you can afford to purchase bedding.;
, In order to prevent diseases or infections entering your body through your guinea pig's waste, you must protect yourself with gloves and not touch the soiled bedding with bare hands.
 Make sure the area you are temporarily placing it in is safe and secure. If you have other pets, close the door to where your guinea pig is while cleaning its cage.


It's recommended you place your guinea pig where you can keep an eye on it while cleaning its cage, preferably in the same room you are in.
If you think you can let the guinea pig roam around in its cage while you're spot cleaning the cage, let the guinea pig stay instead of moving it. This will minimize risk of it hurting itself or getting free. However, when completely cleaning out the cage, you must keep the guinea pig out of your way, especially when you wipe the cage bottom.

 The stem is fragile, and the glass can break easily if you hold it by that. Instead, cup your hand around the bottom of the bowl, with your fingers to either side of the steam.


This method will also work for regular wine glasses.
If you are cleaning painted or glittered wine glasses, use this method.;
, If the water is too hot for you, it is likely too hot for the wine glass; water can cause glass to crack if it is hot enough. Sometimes, this is all that is needed to clean the glass.
 Avoid sticking your hand into the glass itself, or you will risk breaking the glass. Instead, find a soft sponge attached to a long, plastic handle. Focus your cleaning on the places that get the most dirty, such as the rim, the bottom of the glass, and the outside of the bowl.


Do not use steal wool or a scouring pad.Also, avoid using anything with stiff, plastic bristles. All of these can scratch the surface.
 Usually, a simple rinse and light buffing with a soft sponge is all that is needed. If the wine glass is especially dirty, however, you might need to use a mild dish soap. You will not need a lot; a small drop will be enough.


Try to use a low-alkaline detergent, if possible., Be sure to get rid of any soap residue. Crystal absorbs odors and flavors easily. If you don't rinse the wine glass well enough, your next glass of wine might have a slight soapy flavor.
 The soft cloth will help protect the rim from the hard surface of your counter or table.
 This will help prevent any hard water stains. Use a soft, lint-free cloth, such as microfiber.
 Crystal is a very porous material. It absorbs flavors and is easily damaged. If the crystal wine glasses have turned foggy because they were cleaned in the dishwasher at some point in time, the damage is permanent. The heat of the dishwasher would have baked the detergent into the glass.

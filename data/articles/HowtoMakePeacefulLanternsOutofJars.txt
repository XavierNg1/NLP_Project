 The jar or cup must be wide enough for a candle to be placed inside of it with ease.;
, You can have a single color or you can mix up a few colors, or even make a rainbow effect. Obviously, the more colors you have, the more effort you'll need to put into arranging them in a suitable pattern as you attach them. Cut the tissue into neat squares or other suitable shapes.


Cut with care. Tissue paper tends to tear easily.
 It is really important that there is just enough Mod Podge on the brush, not dripping with it, as it may tear the tissue paper if saturated.


It helps to rub the brush against the side of the pot to remove excess Mod Podge.
 Paint the jar with Mod Podge in sections at a time. Perhaps begin at the base and work your way up, or vice versa, turning the jar to complete one section at a time. Once an area of the jar has been painted with the Mod Podge, affix tissue paper pieces to it with care. Overlap the tissue paper to make clean joins.
 Be sure to cover the base of the jar or cup as well. Allow to dry completely.
 Once again, dip the paintbrush into the Mod Podge, ensuring that there isn't an excess of Mod Podge on the paintbrush. Paint gently and carefully over the tissue paper on the outside of the jar or cup.


As you paint, be sure to paint down any pieces of paper that might be sticking up at an awkward angle. This will neaten the whole effect.
 Once dried, the peaceful lantern is ready for use.
 If battery-operated, turn it on before adding it. If a real candle, place it first, then use a long-handled match to light it.
 This lantern will windproof any flame, so it can be used outdoors as well as inside. It's ideal for mood lighting, as a table centerpiece or to simply glow away at an outdoor party.

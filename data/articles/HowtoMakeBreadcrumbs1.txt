 Get out 4 slices of white bread. You can use bread that's a day or two stale or you can toast it a little in the oven or toaster. Take the bread and tear it into small pieces.Use your favorite kind of bread for the breadcrumbs. If you'd like white breadcrumbs, use white bread and trim off the crusts. For whole-wheat breadcrumbs, use a soft-whole wheat bread and leave the crusts on.;
, Place the pieces of bread into a food processor. Blitz the bread until you get coarse bread crumbs. Avoid processing the bread for too long or it may become gummy and clog up the processor. You can use the fresh breadcrumbs or store them in an airtight container.If you don't have a food processor, you can process the bread in a coffee or spice grinder. You can also freeze the slices of bread until they're hard and rub them against a grater to make fresh breadcrumbs.
 Fresh breadcrumbs absorb a lot of moisture, so they're great for baking. Consider using fresh breadcrumbs in recipes for meatballs, meatloaf, or seafood patties. You can also top casseroles or seafood with the fresh breadcrumbs. The breadcrumbs will become slightly crisp once the food bakes in the oven.

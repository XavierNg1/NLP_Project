 If you timed the planting right, the seedlings should have a set of mature leaves and be ready to transplant in time for the growing season, which starts after the last frost of the year. This falls in a different month depending on where you live. If you're unsure when the last frost might take place, ask for advice at your local nursery.
 A few days before you're ready to plant the seedlings, move them to an outdoor shed or garage. Start by giving them an hour outside a day, and increase the amount of time over a week or two. This helps them get used to the outdoor climate before you place them directly in the ground. Without this extra time to acclimate, the shock of the transplant may cause them to suffer.


If you don't have a covered outdoor area, you can place the seedlings outside and construct a makeshift shelter. Leave them in the sun during the day, and cover them with a cardboard box to protect them from the wind at night.
You could also match the temperature in the room where the seedlings are kept to the temperature outside.
 The planting bed should be located in an area that gets the proper amount of sunlight and shade your plant needs. The soil should have the correct pH balance and composition of nutrients. Be sure that it drains well, too.


You can change the pH of the soil by adding amendments like compost or manure. If you are doing this, you should prepare the bed a week or two before planting.
 Dig holes in the ground that are roughly the size of your seedling containers. Make sure the holes are spaced far enough apart so that the plants have plenty of room to grow. Carefully lift the seedlings from their containers, gently separate the root balls a bit, and plant them in the holes.
 As they grow, continue providing the correct conditions for the plants to grow healthy.

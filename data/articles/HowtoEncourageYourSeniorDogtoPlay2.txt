 In order to encourage your dog to continue to play as it ages, you may need to select softer toys made specifically for senior dogs. Older dogs often have weakened muscles and joints, sensitive teeth and jaws, as well as reduced olfactory sensors. As a result, it is important to select toys that can accommodate their aging bodies. There are a variety of options for senior dog toys.For example, senior Kongs are made from a softer rubber and are gentle on the teeth and jaws of senior dogs.
Planet Dog also has a complete line of toys, called Old Soul, designed specifically for older dogs.
Try and find these types of toys while shopping at your local pet supply store.
 Older dogs often have weakened vision and olfactory sensors. As a result you should choose toys that are easier for your senior dog to see and smell. For instance, toys with bright and contrasting colours will allow your dog to see the toy more clearly. Similarly, you can select toys that have a stronger scent to help encourage older dogs to play., A senior dog, although interested in playing, will not be able to play with the same intensity that it did when it was younger. In order to continue to play with your dog as they age, you should modify the games so that they are suitable to an older, less mobile dog. You can also allow your dog to continue to play with some of their favourite toys, but in a modified way.For example, if your dog enjoys to play tug-of-war you can still play this game, just don’t pull as hard on the toy.
Alternatively, if your dog likes to play fetch, try throwing the ball a shorter distance and only throw it five times instead of twenty.
Regardless of the activity, always monitor your dog’s energy level. If they begin to slow down and pant excessively while playing, it is probably a good idea to take a break.

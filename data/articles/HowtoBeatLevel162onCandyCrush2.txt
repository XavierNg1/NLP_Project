 The top and middle parts of the board will provide you limited options. Start with the bottom part to get some lucky or chance combos.
 Don’t overwhelm yourself by attacking the whole board. The board is divided into quadrants. You’ll get a better chance of generating your target candies from there, rather than in the middle.
 Look for moves that will give you Striped Candies. You need ten of these to pass the level. If you’re able to get a Candy Bomb, combine this with a Striped Candy and you should be done with your required number of Striped Candies.


To get Striped Candies, make a match of four candies in a row.
 Although you need only three of these, you should also start looking for moves that will generate these. The board’s layout will make it harder to come up with Wrapped Candies, so make them any chance you get.


Create Wrapped Candies by combining at least three vertical candies with three horizontal candies.
 Once you have some special candies available, go ahead and maximize them. No need to keep them for later as they may just end up eaten by the chocolate.


This will also give you a chance to shake the board with some new candies.

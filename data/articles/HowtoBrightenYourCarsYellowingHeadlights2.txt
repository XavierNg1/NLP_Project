 Method 2 requires wet/dry sandpaper (800grit & 1500grit), a spray bottle filled with clean water, dry cotton towels, and a clear coat spray paint that offers UV protection.
 Once clean, spray a mist of water on the 800 grit paper and start working in a light/soft slow circle motion on one headlight. *keep the paper wet at all times and spray the lens to clear off the mess.
 Wash the lens off and let it dry. It will look even worse than before. Once its fully dry, spray it in an even light coat of the clear spray paint following the instructions on the can. Remember to cover your car's paint and all areas that may get paint overspray on them. Once the clear is dry, you can compare your brighter lens to your old one. Everyone says to just repeat the process on the other lens, but this is you chance to compare and decide if you want to replace or restore. It also gives you the bragging rights and ability to show loved ones the difference and what you can do.

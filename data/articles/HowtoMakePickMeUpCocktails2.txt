For champagne: Cava or Prosecco are both great options. Opt for a sparkling wine that is not too sweet, as the sweetness of the orange juice combined with the sweetness of the wine could overpower the drink.
Chill the orange juice and champagne beforehand. Lukewarm mimosas are not as dapper as chilly ones.
 While most people think of a mimosa as simply containing orange juice and champagne, a true mimosa contains a splash of Triple Sec to fortify the drink.
 Serve.


For a great way to incorporate fruit into the mimosa while chilling the drink, freeze some fruit — raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, mango, pineapple, the list goes on — and then place them in the drink right before serving. They will act as ice cubes and keep your drink cool for you while you sip.

 Chocolate syrup is a popular choice, but you can use other sauces or syrups too, such as: caramel, butterscotch, or strawberry. If you are using a non-fruit sauce (such as caramel), heat it in the microwave for a few seconds to get it nice and hot.For best results, use a sundae dish. A regular dessert bowl will also work, however.;
, The traditional ice cream sundae uses vanilla ice cream, but you can use other flavors as well, such as cookies-and-cream or even strawberry.
 You can use the same flavor of sauce or syrup as before, or experiment with a different flavor. Keep in mind that some flavors work better together than others. A classic combination is chocolate and caramel, for example.
 Chopped walnuts or sprinkles are classic ice cream sundae toppings, but you can also add more creative ones as well! Here are some tasty ideas to get you started:

Crushed cookies
Crushed candies
Candy, such as mini M&Ms, gummi bears, chocolate chips, etc.
Mini marshmallows
Other chopped nut, such as peanuts, pecans, hazelnuts, cashews, etc.
 You can use homemade whipped cream and a piping bag, or you can use the kind that comes in a can with a nozzle., For a fancier touch, you can also add in a wafer triangle or wafer straw. If you don't have any maraschino cherries on hand, you can use a small strawberry instead; it will give you a similar look!

, Enjoy it before it melts!

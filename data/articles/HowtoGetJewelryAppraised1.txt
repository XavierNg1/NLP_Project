 Characteristics should include weights, grades and measurements of components. The color grade of the gemstone should be determined by using comparison gemstones.;
, If any atypical treatments were conducted on your gemstone or if your gemstone is untreated, this should be noted on the appraisal.
,, The value depends on whether you want to insure your jewelry for its actual cash value, its replacement value or its agreed value.


Cash value is the value of your jewelry at today’s market rate, not at the purchase price.
Replacement value means the insurer will pay you a specific amount according to its current market value at the time of the loss.
Agreed value means that you and your insurer settle on a specific value that you will receive in the event of a loss.
, If your appraisal is for an insurer, then your appraiser should use one of the following forms from the Jewelry Insurance Standards Organization:


JISO 805—Jewelry Sales Receipt for Insurance Purposes. This form is used when you are purchasing jewelry and can be completed by the retailer who sold the jewelry to you.
JISO 806—Jewelry Document for Insurance Purposes. This form is used when you’re obtaining a second appraisal.
JISO 78—Jewelry Insurance Appraisal—Single Item. This form must be completed by a Certified Insurance Appraiser and is a highly detailed description of the item.
JISO 79—Jewelry Insurance Appraisal—Multiple Items. This form is also completed by a Certified Insurance Appraiser and is used for the valuation of multiple items of jewelry.

 Enter your email and password into the corresponding fields and press “Log in”.


If you do not yet have an account, go to the PayPal homepage. Click "Sign Up" and then input an email address and password for your new account. You'll receive a confirmation email within a few minutes. Click "Activate My Account" in the confirmation email to complete your PayPal account creation. You will be automatically logged in.
 This will redirect you to a page with all of your payment methods.
 This button appears under the “Credit and debit cards” header. This will redirect you to a form to input card information.
 Select “Credit” from the type of cards and enter your card number, expiration date (in the MM/YY format), and CSC (3 digit number listed on the back of the card). If you do not already have one listed on your account, you will also have to enter your card’s billing address.


PayPal will auto-populate this area if you have an address on file.
You can enter a new billing address on this page by selecting the address and choosing “Add a new billing address” from the dropdown.
 Wait while PayPal confirms your card information. This process may take up to 30 seconds. Once your credit card is confirmed, it will be listed on the wallet page and ready to use in transactions. Only the last four digits and expiration date are displayed.
 Once you link a credit card to your PayPal account, you can edit or remove the card link by selecting the card and clicking on the "Edit" or "Remove" button.


You can have multiple cards linked to your account. When you make payments with PayPal, you will be able to select from the different payment methods you have on file.

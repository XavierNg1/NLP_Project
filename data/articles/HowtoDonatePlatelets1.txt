 You may donate platelets if you:

Have not gotten a tattoo/touch-up or piercing within the last 12 months (unless performed in a sterile environment)
Are not pregnant or trying to become pregnant
Have not traveled to a country with a malarial risk
Are in good health. This means that you are feeling well and are able to do normal daily activities. Those with chronic medical conditions may still be eligible, as long as they are receiving treatment for their condition.;
, Having food in your system will help alleviate the feeling of lightheadedness after you donate. It is recommended to increase your consumption of calcium-rich foods the night and morning before your donation. You should also make sure to drink plenty of non-caffeinated fluids, such as water and fruit juice. It is recommended that you drink 6-8 good-sized glasses in the three hours before you donate.
, Because platelet donation takes between 1.5 and 2.5 hours, it is helpful to make appointments to avoid long wait times.

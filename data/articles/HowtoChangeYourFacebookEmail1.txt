,,, There are two different types of email addresses associated with Facebook, your contact and recovery address, and your Facebook-created email address. Both can be changed from this page, though you can only change your Facebook-generated address once.



Contact and recovery email - Click the "Edit" link next to your current email address. Click "Add email" and then enter the email address you want to change to. Open the verification email that is sent to your email account and follow the link to confirm the email account. This will now be the primary contact and recovery email address for your account.Facebook-created email address - Click the "Edit" link next to your Username (this looks like a web address). Your username is used to create your Facebook email address, and changing it will change the email address. You can only change your username once and if it doesn't include your real name Facebook may revert it.

 Heat a bowl of vinegar until it's hot or fill the bowl with fresh lemon juice. Place the part of the fabric with the gum in the hot vinegar or lemon juice. Leave the gum to soak. You should be able to easily scrape or brush the gum off. Wash the fabric as soon as you've removed the gum.Always test a small area of fabric before you soak the gum. This will let you know if the fabric will be damaged by the hot vinegar or lemon juice.
 If you can't freeze the gum off with a freezer or ice cube, spray it with hair spray. This should harden the gum so you can simply pop it off. You can also take a blunt tool and gently pry off the gum.Ensure that the hairspray won't damage the fabric by testing a small area of the fabric before you begin.
 Consider spreading a cooking oil or mayonnaise over the gum. You'll need to massage the oil or mayo into the gum a little. This will make it easier to scrape off. Immediately wash the fabric to prevent the oil from staining the cloth.Keep in mind that you may have trouble removing oil stains from delicate fabrics. Only use oil if you know you can wash it out of the fabric.
 While peanut butter may be great for removing gum from hair, it can leave oily residue that damages leather. You should also avoid using compressed air to freeze gum off of fabrics.

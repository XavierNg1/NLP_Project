 Cost varies according to breeder and species. Hand fed birds cost more. Below are some examples of prices you may need to pay:


Congo African Grey $900
Macaws $950-1400
Cockatoos $950
Hahn's Mini Macaws $600
Baby Amazon $900-1200;
, Smaller parrots like the Conure can reside in smaller cages, which cost around $400, but larger parrots like the Macaw need more space, thus, their cages can cost several thousand dollars.
 In the wild, a parrot will fly an average of 30 miles (48Â km) a day. Clearly, cage living is a far cry from that kind of freedom and exercise. This necessitates climbing apparatus and plenty of time out of confinement. Structures such as play gyms and t-stands are a good solution and cost between $100-500. Toys generally range in cost from anywhere between $50-100, unless you do some research and make your own.
 All types of parrots require a mixed and balanced diet of seed mix, pellets, and fresh fruit and vegetables. The cost varies according to the size of your bird. Seed mix will range from $8-20 a month, pellets will cost between $10-30, and fresh produce will cost roughly $15-50. This means that a monthly food total can run between $65-140 a month.
 This includes annual exams and immunizations, and will cost between $100-250/year, again depending on the breed and size of your pet. Emergency care costs more; anywhere between $250-2000

, When you go on vacation or have any sort of emergency that takes you away from home, your parrot will have to be boarded somewhere. The fee for a 10-day stay ranges between $100-250.
 The total cost of caring for a parrot for a year can cost anywhere between $2000-4000.

 Make sure to use white, creamy sunscreen as opposed to colored or spray sunscreen. Use a white rag or cloth so you will be able to see if the sunscreen is removing the coloring of the leather.








If you start out with a small amount of sunscreen, removing the coloring of the leather should not be a problem.
 Use gentle pressure when rubbing the stain so as not to remove any coloring of the leather. If it is a large stain, only work on small sections at a time.








While removing the stain, use more sunscreen as needed.
 Once the stain is removed, clean the area with mild soap and water. Use a clean cloth or rag to clean the area. Also use a clean, dry cloth to dry the area.








You may need to use a leather conditioner to restore the affected area. A conditioner will also protect the leather from further damage.

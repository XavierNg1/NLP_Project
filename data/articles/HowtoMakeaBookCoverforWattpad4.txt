 Simply click the "Insert" tab, and then "Picture". Choose your picture from the window that pops up, and make it the right size on your Microsoft Word document without stretching it or causing it to become pixelated.
 Still on the "Insert" tab of your Microsoft Word document, click "WordArt". Choose which one you would like, then edit the text to the title of your Wattpad story. Change the font, colour and effects to the way you want them, then make them the right size and place them over your photo (make sure they all fit on the photo and no words hang off the side). Do the same with the your name/Wattpad user name.
 Press ctrl + prt sc (control and print screen) at the same time, and then left-click your Microsoft Word document. Select "paste". The screenshot of your screen will appear. This may also be done in Paint.
 Once your screenshot is there, click it, and then click the "Picture Tools > Format" tab. Select "Crop" from the right side of the menu. Crop the picture to just your book cover by moving the black indicators around its edges, then clicking the "Crop" button again. There is your book cover.
 Left-click the photo you just cropped, and then click "Save as Picture". Save it to your photos or where ever else you will be able to easily locate it.
 You have to make an account, but as soon as you do that there is a button on your home screen to upload the cover. It's as simple as that! You now have a beautiful book cover to accompany your story!

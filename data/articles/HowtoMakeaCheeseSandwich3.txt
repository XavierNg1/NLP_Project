 Cut 2 slices of crusty bread, such as French bread. Spread some softened butter over one side of each slice of bread.


For a fancier sandwich, try pesto, olive oil, or hummus.
You can also use mayo or a thick, creamy salad dressing, such as Ranch, Italian, or Green Goddess.
 Place the bottom slice down, buttered-side-up. Place 1 to 2 leaves of lettuce on top. If the lettuce leaves are much larger than the sandwich, cut them into halves or thirds first.


Some types of lettuce have a very thick stem in the middle. Reduce bulk by cutting this stem out with a sharp knife.
 Cut a thin slice off of a red onion. Separate the slice into rings. Place as many rings as you want onto the lettuce.


You can leave the onion rings off if you want to.
 Cut off two thick slices of tomato. Stack them on top of the lettuce and onion. A thick, meaty tomato would work the best for this.
 Add a sprinkle of salt and a dash of pepper on top of the tomato slices. How much you use is entirely up to you!

, Carefully lay 1 to 2 slices of sharp, white Cheddar on top of the sandwich. Make sure that they are covering the tomatoes entirely. They will keep your sandwich from getting soggy.


If you don't like Cheddar, try Swiss, Monterey Jack, or Provolone instead.
 For an extra-fancy touch, slice the sandwich in half diagonally from corner-to-corner. Stick a fancy toothpick or cocktail stick through each sandwich half to hold it together.

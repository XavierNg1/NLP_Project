 You should anticipate being instructed to stop wearing contacts for a period of several weeks before the procedure. You will also be told to avoid wearing eye makeup for a period leading up to the procedure. Make sure that you will be able to follow these instructions before scheduling the procedure.
 Since your vision will be blurry after the procedure, you will not be able to drive yourself home. Make sure that a friend or family member will be available to take you home after the procedure is complete and while you recover.
 You will experience some blurry vision and/or vision fluctuations after LASIK eye surgery. Most patients report improved vision within a day of the procedure, but it may take longer. It can take two or three months for your vision to fully stabilize after surgery, though most patients can resume driving and return to work within a few days.Before you schedule the procedure, you should make sure that this recovery period will not interfere with other aspects of your life.


At the end of the procedure, a shield or protective wrap will be placed over your eye. This eye protection will keep the corneal cut from being disturbed during the healing process. Anticipate wearing this for the remainder of the day after your surgery, and possibly at night.
 You will need to visit your doctor for a post-surgical check-up within 24-48 hours of the surgery. You may want to plan a few days off from work following the initial surgery. Healing from LASIK usually happens rapidly and you should notice improved vision with a few days of the surgery.


The doctor will monitor your progress periodically for six months after surgery. Complications can develop after the procedure and vision can worsen gradually over time, so most doctors will follow a patientâ€™s progress for one year.

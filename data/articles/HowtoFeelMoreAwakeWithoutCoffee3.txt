 This is a mistake that many make, and it can seriously impact your wakefulness throughout the day. Think of your body like a car that needs fuel. Starting off the day by eating breakfast gives you the energy you need to start your day. Stay away from sugary breakfast items like donuts or muffins. Instead, eat breakfast items like eggs, oatmeal or yogurt for a breakfast that is high in protein.
 Many doctors recommend drinking 8 glasses of water a day. Water has countless benefits, but they include making you more refreshed and awake. Make sure to drink water before or after eating salty or dehydrating foods.


You can also use water as a quick fix whenever you are feeling tired. Tiredness is a side effect of being dehydrated, so when you are feeling tired try drinking a glass of water.
 It's tempting to eat a piece of candy to give you that energy spurt. However, candy will give you an energy crash that may make you feel even worse. Instead of candy, eat an apple or banana. The sugar from fruit boosts your blood sugar but does not give you a sugar crash like candy does.
 Complex carbs like whole grains give you a long dose of energy. They are better than simple carbohydrates like sugar and soft drinks because they give you long-lasting energy with no crash. Some examples of complex carbohydrates are green vegetables, potatoes, beans, corn and lentils.
 Food comas are real. Eating too much can make you feel unproductive and lethargic. It's natural to have a little lull in energy after lunch, but you can manage it by eating healthily and not overdoing it with portion size. Monitor your portion size by bringing food from home. This way you will know how exactly how much you are eating and you won't make any impulsive food decisions. It also can save you money!

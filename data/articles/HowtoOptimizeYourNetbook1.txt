 Most people with good eyesight go for the 9” display (1024 x 600). Smaller than that often means a lower screen resolution that most web pages won’t fit in, presenting you with a horizontal scroll-bar. A 10” model offers a bigger keyboard and more readable text. People with poor eyesight can even consider a 12". Although that's not a netbook anymore, it's still more portable than a 15" notebook. In that range, you also find better hardware specifications than the relative simple netbooks, but with a higher price tag as well.;
, Keep in mind that with time the battery performance will decrease. You take a netbook with you without the power adapter, so you need more autonomy. Some models are lifted higher up thanks to the bigger battery, providing better ventilation and a good grip to hold it better. In situations where you will work longer on your netbook than the expected battery duration, you can take the power supply with you OR a second battery.
, SSD (Solid State Disk) boots faster and is more robust. On the other hand, HDD (hard disk drive) typically holds more and works better if you use demanding applications or download lots of music or videos. Adding a portable hard disk goes at expense of mobility.
 They don’t make the netbook much bigger but still protect it against dust, rain and impact. Try it with the biggest battery mounted. Alternatively, a toilet bag can be used. They are cheap, waterproof and leave a bit of space for the extra battery or adapter.

 This doesn't have to mean big expensive gifts or trips to Paris! Send them a text letting them know you are thinking about them or leave little love notes around the house. Kisses and hugs can also go a long way in showing your partner how much you care about them.;
, When they're trying to communicate with you, don't just sit there on your phone or watching television. Tune everything else out and give them your undivided attention for at least a few minutes. Though simple, this process can be extremely helpful, especially if your partner and you normally don't listen to each much.
 You don't necessarily have to like it yourself, but try to be appreciative of their interests. When they get excited about their favorite team winning a game or the newest episode of Doctor Who, let them tell you about it to their heart's content. Make sure they know that you're happy to talk about it if it makes them happy.
 Put some effort into planning it, whether it's a romantic picnic in the park or playing an old fashioned board game. It doesn't have to be a grand or expensive gesture, just so long as it shows that you're thinking about your partner.
 What do you love about them? Have they got a cute smile? Pretty eyes? Personality-based compliments are even betterâ€”tell your partner that you love how considerate or quick-witted they are. Don't keep it to yourself! Whatever nice thing you have to say about them, it will most likely improve their day to hear it.

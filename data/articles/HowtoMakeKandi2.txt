 To do this, wrap the string around your wrist and add an extra two inches of length to tie off the ends.
 You may want to decide on a pattern before you start stringing, or you might want a random selection of beads. Either way, it is good to make that decision before you start putting your kandi together.
 If you are using a clasp, you will need to attach one of the clasps to one end of the string; this will be the end your beads rest on. If you aren’t, fold the elastic in half. You'll have to be careful when threading the beads in the next steps to always hold on to both ends, so no beads slip off.
 For a single-strand piece of kandi, there is no special way to string them. It’s all up to you! Put enough beads on the thread that it is completely full except for an inch at the end.
 Tie off the end of your kandi with a knot. If you used clasps, add the second class to the end of the bracelet. If not, then simply use the two loose ends to tie in a knot around your wrist.

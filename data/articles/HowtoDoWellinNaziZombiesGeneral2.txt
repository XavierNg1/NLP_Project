 #Do not buy any weapons within the first 2 rooms unless you absolutely need to! The Olympia and the M14 are useless in rounds 5 and 6 so don't waste your money on them. Same applies to the PM63 and MPL, both lose their value a little later (Round 9-10). If you need a gun, buy one of the guns in the next room, but never buy a gun from the opening room.
 All of these guns are cheap and powerful. These can last you a few rounds longer (13-14) if you use them correctly. In the Black Ops 2 maps, a good gun to pick up is the MP50, a more advanced version of the MP40. More valuable weapons from BO2 include the AN-94, PDW, and SVU-50.
 In BO2, there is a new knife weapon called Galvaknuckles. While extremely expensive (6000 points), this weapon deals 1 hit kills to zombies all the way up to round 13. Very effective for picking up lots of points., The mystery box gives you a variety of guns (at 950 points a try) and it gives you access to the most powerful and the weakest guns in the game.

The mystery box is a gamble, you do not know what you are going to get, so if you do not get the gun you want after a few tries, stop and try again later. Using the mystery box too much will deplete your of points and that can really hurt if you get stuck in a bad situation. Treat the mystery box with caution.
 The damage of the gun and the ammo that the gun holds increases and your guns get a new camouflage (camouflage depends on the map). It costs 5000 points (and on Black Ops 2 and onwards, 2500 to repack-a-punch your guns) but will make surviving high rounds much easier. Some guns benefit from Pack-A-Punching more than other guns, for instance, starting pistols become grenade launchers but the Ray Gun pack-a-punched tends to just make it easier to make crawler zombies.

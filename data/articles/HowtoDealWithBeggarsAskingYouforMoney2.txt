 Speak with beggars on busy, well-lit streets. Remain standing, as crouching or sitting makes you less visible. Don’t follow anyone into an empty alleyway or dark corner., If you’re giving directions or handing over some food, don’t look away from the beggar. Distraction is a common tactic thieves use to rob victims with good intentions.While most beggars aren’t criminals, you should always use caution.
 While driving, you might be tempted to help a beggar at a traffic light by getting out of your car. This holds up traffic and puts you in danger of a traffic accident. Acknowledge them with a nod or a smile, but do it from your car.
 If a beggar becomes aggressive, you shouldn’t allow yourself to be bullied. Shout to draw attention to yourself. Walk into a nearby business and ask for assistance. If you see a police officer in the area, tell them about your situation.

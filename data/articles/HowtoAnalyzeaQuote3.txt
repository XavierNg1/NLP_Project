 Before presenting the quote that you will be analyzing, provide a sentence or two that sets up its tone and importance. Give some indication of how the quote should be received by attributing a positive or negative value to it. If possible, show how the quote was received when it it was first spoken or written.For instance, set up a negative quote by saying something like, "Critics of the group were vocal about their dismay."
Situate a quote within a theme or phenomenon by saying something like, "The anti-vaccine movement has swept across the country in recent years."

, Frame the quote within the context of who said it, when, and where. Provide the name of the individual who said it, and a bit of background about who they were and why they said it. Be sure to note when the quote was made and through what medium (e.g., in a book or speech).For instance: "In his 1975 publication, 'Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison', Michel Foucault had this to say about power, knowledge, and sexualityÂ : "

, As a general rule, you should always present a quote in the same way as it was originally presented. Reproduce the spelling, internal punctuation, and capitalization of written quotes exactly, even if these elements are grammatically incorrect. If you are quoting a lecture, speech, or interview, make sure to get an accurate transcript to use from a library or reputable online archive.

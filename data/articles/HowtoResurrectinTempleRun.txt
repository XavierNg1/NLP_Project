 You'll need 500 coins collected from your runs.;
, To do this:


Either double tap on your character and the wings will appear.
Or, there is usually a small bar at the top with the wings symbol on it. Tap on this and the wings will come into use.
 If you do fall or get caught by monkeys, the wings will resurrect you at the point this happened.


Note that the wings eventually fade, so if this happens before you fall or get caught, you can't resurrect with that set but will need to start all over again.

 Wind-up type alarm clocks with bells, clock radios, and even many cell phones and pagers can be set to play an alert that can wake even the deepest sleepers.;
, Based on the device chosen above, it may be possible to select from 2 or more types of alarm signal. Many clock radios offer choice of a wake alarm consisting of a radio station broadcast (of the user's choice) or a simple buzzer. There may be two volume controls; one for the "sleep" mode and another for the "wake alarm" mode. Setting the wrong one could result in not hearing the wake alarm. It may also be possible to set two or more wake times.
 If the device used for a wake alarm will only allow for a single alarm time, consider using a second device in the list above as a back up alarm source. This is a good practice should the first device fail to operate (due to power outage, defect, etc.). The device(s) should be self powered (as would be the case for a pager or cell phone) or have a battery back up to keep time in the event of a power failure. Set the second device to alert a minute or two before or after the main device.
 Set the alarm type, volume, etc. as desired, but set the alarm time to alert a minute or two in the future, instead of the wake time. Wait for the alarm time to start the alarm. Adjust volume, tuning, etc. settings as needed on all devices. Make sure those devices with multiple alarms are fully functional (make sure the second alarm alerts).
 If afraid of shutting of the alarm and going back to sleep, try locating the device where it will be required to actually get out of bed to reset the alarm. Of course, this won't prevent climbing back into bed, but may help lessen the chances of that happening.

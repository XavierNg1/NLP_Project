 You cannot play properly on single player, as the enemies are too easy and won't be such a challenge.;
, Sometimes it can be too dangerous and suicidal to play up front, so an easy way to safely top the score table is with remote weapons. Use these to stand right at the back of the battlefield next to a weapons droid, and kill maybe even 5 players with a recon droid. Recon droids are cheap- 10 credits- and could be the best weapon of the game.
, Combined with wrist rockets, it is the ultimate duo which is the best way to dispose of Jedi etc.. A simple shot will freeze anything alive, and a couple of wrist rockets will finish off even those macros.

 Rayon can be easily manipulated and permanently changed when exposed to water. Gently hand wash the garment and let it soak in the water for several minutes to significantly shrink your fabric but also protect the material., If your rayon garment is much too big, throw it in the washing machine with some regular detergent and wash on a warm or hot cycle., If you don’t want to make any drastic changes to your rayon garment, shrink it in a more subtle way. Soak a bath towel in water, lay the rayon flat on the towel, and then roll the towel up and let it sit so that the moisture can soak into the fabric.Try this method first if you’re worried about shrinking your garment too much. If you want it shrunken more, you can always resort to one of the other methods for your second attempt.

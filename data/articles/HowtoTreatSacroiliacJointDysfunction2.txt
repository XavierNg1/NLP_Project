 Never bend over from your waist to pick up an object. Bend your knees and bring you buttocks over your heels. Stare straight ahead with your head up and bring the object as close to your chest as possible. Lift it using the movement of your legs as you straighten them back into a standing position., Whether you are standing or sitting, it is important that you have good posture with a straight, upright back. Try not to hunch, slouch, or bend forward.

When you stand, keep a straight line through your shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles.When you sit, avoid slumping back against the chair. Instead, maintain an upright, straight back.
 Avoid falling asleep in a curled up fetal position. Try to sleep on your back with one pillow under your neck and a larger pillow or set of pillows under your knees. You can also try sleeping on your side with a pillow between your legs.Improper sleeping postures are just as bad for your back as lifting improperly.
 Talk to a physical therapist about which movements you should avoid. Healthy movements will help strengthen your SI joint, but unhealthy motions will pull it further out of place.Some movements you should avoid include:


Any movement that brings your knees to your chest
Bending forward with your knees straight
Sit-ups
Seated twists
Seated forward folds with straight knees

, Maintain a balanced diet and consider shedding some weight to decrease the stress on your back and hips.Try using an app or other resource to calculate your body mass index (BMI) and create a personalized meal plan. For example, use the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Super Tracker tool: https://www.supertracker.usda.gov/.


Choose low-impact exercises like walking instead of more strenuous exercise, even if you’re trying to lose weight.

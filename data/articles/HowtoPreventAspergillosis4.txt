 If you have a compromised immune system, one way to lower your risk of aspergillosis is to create an environment in which it does not thrive. You can do this by making sure your home air conditioner is working well, and your humidity is relatively low as well. Make sure to:


Set your air conditioner to 75 or lower.
Monitor your humidity and take steps to keep it below 50%.
Stay proactive about maintaining your air conditioning unit., Another good way to lower your risk of aspergillosis is to monitor the air quality in your home or at work. Testing your air quality will let you know if there are mold or other fungal spores in your air. As a result, you’ll know better how to mitigate any risks associated with aspergillus and aspergillosis infection.


Test your air quality every year to six months.
Contact a home inspector that can run air quality tests.
Air quality tests can cost from between $50 to $200, depending on how many rooms you are testing.
Air quality test kits are also available through mail order at your local hardware store., One great way to prevent aspergillosis at home is to use an air purifier or have a HEPA filtration system running at all times. This way, the air purifier and HEPA system will filter out dangerous aspergillus out of the air you breathe.


Have a professional install an air filtration system in your home.
If you can’t afford an installed system, buy an air filter and keep it in areas of the house you frequent.
Use a portable air filtration system at work.

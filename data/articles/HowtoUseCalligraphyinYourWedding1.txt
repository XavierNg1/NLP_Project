 Before your wedding begins, you can start the calligraphy theme with invitations. Send guests invitations written in calligraphy that include you and your spouse's name, as well as the date, time, and place of the ceremony.Make sure the calligraphy you use is fairly legible. You want guests to know the important details and calligraphy can sometimes be difficult to read.;
, If you're having a destination wedding, send a map. A map can be a memento for guests and can also be used to help guests find their way to a tricky location. You can have the writing on the map written in calligraphy, giving it an old fashioned feel.If there are important or complicated directions on the map, it may be best to refrain from using calligraphy in these portions of the map. You want to make sure guests know where to go.
 Before the ceremony, you should have a room set up for bridesmaids and groomsmen to change. You can hang up garments, like bridesmaids dresses or suits, with hangers that use calligraphy. Write out the names of members of the wedding party in stylish calligraphy on your hangers. This will be a fun way to incorporate calligraphy into your big day as well as provide gifts for members of the wedding party.

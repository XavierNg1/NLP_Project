 Receiving blankets are cheap, and cotton is fairly absorbent. You can also use other rectangles of fabric made from terry cloth, flannel, or other absorbent materials.


Make sure you use a square receiving blanket.
If you're using another fabric other than a receiving blanket, cut it into a square that's 34" to 36" on each side.
 Use the floor or another large surface. Smooth out any wrinkles in the blanket.
 Take the two right hand corners of the blanket and bring them to the two left-hand corners so that the blanket is folded in half.
 This time, take the two top corners and bring them to the two bottom corners to fold the blanket in half again. You should now have a square shape again.


Smooth out any wrinkles in the blanket after folding it.
 Take the top layer of the bottom left corner and pull it towards the right. The corner should lie to the right of the rest of the blanket, and this should form a triangle shape. The blanket should now look like a wide triangle with a square layer underneath the left side.
 Grab hold of the bottom right and the top corner of the triangle shape and flip the entire blanket over so that the triangle points down instead of up. Flatten it smooth again.
 Grab the two edges of on the left of the blanket that make up the square shape. Fold this into a rectangle that lies in the middle of the triangle by folding it over two or three times. This is your diaper shape.
 You use the diaper by laying your baby so that the wide edge of the triangle is lined up with their waist. Fold the bottom of the diaper up the baby's front side. Fold both sides of the triangle in to meet the front of the diaper and pin them all together over the baby's waist.

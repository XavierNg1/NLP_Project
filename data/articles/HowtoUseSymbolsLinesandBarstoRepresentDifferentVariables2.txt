 Maybe you want to look at how the number of vegetarian on campus compares to the number of vegans. Whatever your categories, you will need at least two of them to compare, though you can also use more than two.
 A bar graph uses colored bars to represent a certain amount. Therefore, both the bottom and the side represent different variables.


For instance, you could have one bar represent vegetarians and one bar to represent vegans. The left side will show the increments.
 For instance, if you are talking about pescetarians on campus, you can refer to them that way the first time, but you can also add a symbol or abbreviation to use later, such as “PoC.” Just be sure to make it clear in your paper what abbreviation goes with what variable.


You can do this for any form of presenting information, be it pie chart, bar graph, or line graph.
 Since there are only 60 vegetarians and vegans total on campus, going up in 5-person increments on the left side makes sense.


Therefore, the vegetarian bar will go up to 50 people, while the vegan bar will only go up to 10 people, showing that there are more vegetarians on campus.

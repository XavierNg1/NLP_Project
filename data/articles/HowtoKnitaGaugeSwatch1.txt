 This is a rectangle of knitted fabric used to ensure that your finished garment will be the size you intended. Some patterns require that you wash and block (or shape while damp) your swatch before measuring--this is important because some yarns will change gauge after washing and blocking. Wash the swatch the same way you plan to wash the finished item.;
, Hold or pin it down flat--don't stretch it or scrunch it. If you cast on the number of stitches specified in the pattern, it should be 4 inches (10.2Â cm) on each side, forming an even square (the corners should make right angles, the square shouldn't be crooked).
 Count the stitches and rows per inch. In the gauge swatch shown, there are 8 stitches and 6 rows. It can be difficult at first to count the stitches and rows correctly, depending on the type of stitch your knitting the gauge swatch with, but in stockinette stitch, each v when counting across is a stitch and each v counting down is a row. Avoid counting the edges. How many stitches are there per inch? And how many rows per inch? Multiply the number of stitches per one inch by four--then you'll know if you have the correct number of stitches per four inches, as specified in the pattern.
 If you need more stitches or rows per inch, use smaller needles. If you need less, use bigger needles. Every time you try a new set of needles, knit a new gauge swatch to test them. You can also adjust your gauge by changing the type of yarn you use (thinner yarn if you need more stitches or rows, thicker yarn if you need less) but this is usually inconvenient and should not be necessary if you purchased yarn similar to what was recommended.

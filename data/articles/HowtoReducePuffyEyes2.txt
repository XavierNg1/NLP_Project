 Spoons make a great cold compress for your eyes, especially for your under eye area. Put some ice and water into a cup and then place the spoons into the cup. Allow them to sit for about five minutes so that they get cold. Another option is to put two spoons in the freezer for about an hour., Apply light pressure to hold the spoon in place. Be careful not to press too hard because your eyes are very delicate. To make this process more relaxing, recline in a chair or lay down.You can try to do both eyes at once, but it might be hard to keep each spoon in place with just one hand.
 Remove when you are finished or when the spoon becomes warm. After you have finished with one eye, repeat the same process with the other one. You may want to have a towel handy to dry any moisture from the spoons that accumulates on your skin during this process.


Cold spoons are only a temporary fix for puffy eyes. Keep cold spoons in the freezer at all times so that you always have cold compresses to use when you get puffy eyes.

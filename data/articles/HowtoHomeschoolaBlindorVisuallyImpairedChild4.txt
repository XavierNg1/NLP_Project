 One of the drawbacks of homeschooling is that your child may not get an opportunity to socialize with their peers. Socialization is a very important part of learning and development. In order to ensure that your child has an opportunity to socialize with other children, you can join a homeschooling social group in your area. These groups are typically comprised of other children that are homeschooled and they meet periodically and provide fun social activities for the children.You can also look for a social group that is made up of other blind or visually impaired children.
 Extracurricular activities, such as organized sports and activity groups, provide an excellent opportunity for your child to socialize with other children and develop communication and teamwork skills that may not be taught through homeschooling.Certain activities may need to be modified in order to allow a blind or visually impaired child to play. For example, when playing sports you could suggest using a larger ball, creating a bigger target, and using sound cues for communication.
 You can also socialize your blind or visually impaired child in a less formal setting. For example, plan a play date with other kids in your neighbourhood. You could invite a few kids over to play while you supervise them, or you could go to a local park and allow the kids to play together.


You can also incorporate activities specifically for blind or visually impaired children, such as arts and crafts or sensory experiences.

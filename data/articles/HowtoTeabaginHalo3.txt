 Remember, it's a frowned upon practice that may upset or anger your opponent - after all, you've killed them, do you really need to rub it in more? If someone has been doing it to you in the match and you want revenge, it is understandable, but most people will think you are a big-head or loser if you teabag without provocation, so decide carefully.;
, Any kill will do, but teabagging is usually performed as a form of bragging and humiliation to your opponents, so a good kill will work much better, especially if it is with a low-level weapon such as a Magnum.
 Make sure you get there fast as there is only a limited amount of time before the player's screen cannot watch it any more, so time is of the essence. Getting to a player's body may be difficult if you killed them long-range or with an explosive weapon, which may fling the body anywhere.
 This is called teabagging, named after a sexual act which couples perform. You may choose to crouch up and down slowly or rapidly - it's your choice.
 Shooting the body may also work, but will waste your valuable ammo.
 You do not want to teabag for more than 3-5 seconds, as after this time, your opponent won't be watching any more as they will have spawned and you risk being killed by another player. People are more likely to kill you if you are teabagging one of their team mates, so take care.

 Baby powder is an easy, on-the-go way to keep wet sand at bay. Baby powder strips the moisture from your skin, which makes sand easier to remove. Dry sand is easier to get rid of than wet sand., Step underneath the beach shower and allow the water to get rid of the superficial layer of sand thatâ€™s on you. Use a clean towel to wipe yourself dry.
 Be generous with the amount of powder you sprinkle on your skin for best results. Rub the powder onto your calves and feet.
 The baby powder will absorb the moisture and leave dry sand and white powder residue behind. For a better cleanup, a dry paintbrush can be used to prevent making a mess of your belongings. Your legs and feet will be sweet-smelling, smooth, and clean!

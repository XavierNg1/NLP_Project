 On mobile devices, AdBlock usually takes the form of an application which must have been previously downloaded through your app store. If you have not already downloaded it, this process will not be necessary.

Note that mobile ad-blocking is a recent development, and is currently lacking some of the features or control of a full system.
Check your phone's app store for "content blockers" or "ad blockers" and install them to your phone.
 You can disable/enable the mobile version of AdBlock through the "Settings" menu. Simply find the AdBlock app in list to adjust the settings. You can now also download some ad-blockers for Safari on your iPhone, and they are easy managed by clicking through "Settings" → "Safari" → "Content Blockers" and disable/enable the blocker you installed from the app store., Unfortunately, it is a bit harder to use AdBlock on a phone than on a computer. More often than not you need to go into the settings associated with your specific browser in order to give AdBlock (or others) permission to block ads.

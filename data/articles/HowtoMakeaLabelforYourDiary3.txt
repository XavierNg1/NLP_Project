 Scrap fabric is ideal, or you might like to buy a special piece of fabric. Calico, cheesecloth or muslin will work too, for a more rustic and simple look.
 Do you want the cloth label to cover the diary's front or just fit into one area of it? Decide, then cut it to size.
 This might be by using fabric markers or stitching with thread. Both ways will look great. You could even combine the two approaches. Some suggestions for decorating include:


Stitching a design or message on the fabric using embroidery thread and embroidery stitches; be as fancy as you like, including making knot roses, three-dimensional flowers, etc., or keep it very simple and naive-style.
Use fabric pens or paints to draw and paint a picture and any words. You could draw an animal, add a poem or a saying, or create a pattern, for instance.
 Glue it in place, taking care to smooth out any wrinkles or bubbling that might form.


If wished, cover with Mod Podge to seal. However, this will change the texture of the fabric considerably, so be sure you want stiffened fabric before doing this.
 The diary will now have a nice texture and and old-world charm.

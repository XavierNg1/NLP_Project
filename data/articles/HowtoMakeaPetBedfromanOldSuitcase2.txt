 While cleaning it, remove any straps or other items that may either be harmful to your pet, provide a chewing temptation or will potentially compromise the design.


Consider using a vacuum cleaner to remove any dust and/or debris. A handheld vacuum cleaner can be helpful.
Use a clean cloth to polish and clean both the inside and outside of the suitcase, depending on what it's made from.
 However, if you are creating a travel case where you will store some of your petâ€™s items on one side, leave this part intact.


Depending upon how they are secured, use a screwdriver to easily (and safely) unscrew each hinge and separate the luggage.
If leaving the lid in place, ensure that there is a special hinge that prevents the lid from slamming shut on your pet's head should he accidentally bump the lid down. You may need to add such a hinge.

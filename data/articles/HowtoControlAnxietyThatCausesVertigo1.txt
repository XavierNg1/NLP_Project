 Meditation is a technique done to relax the mind. This relaxation technique produces a sense of calmness and peacefulness. With the many things we do and encounter everyday, anxiety becomes common.Meditation practices can help reduce your levels of stress hormones. To try meditating:


Find a quiet place to relax. Stretch your neck, arms and feet before meditation. Sit in a comfortable position and focus on your breathing. Let your worries, thoughts, and emotions drift away while you concentrate on the breath flowing in and out of your body.
Try meditating for 20 minutes, twice a day.;
, Controlling your breath can help you to stop hyperventilating, which is often what causes a sensation of vertigo. By slowing down your breathing, you can restore the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your body. In order to control your breathing, sit down in a quiet place.Breathe in through your nose for five seconds and then hold your breath for a second. After you hold your breath, release your breath slowly over the course of seven seconds.
Repeat this process until you feel less anxious and the feelings of vertigo have faded.
 One of the accompanying symptoms of vertigo is an inability to see clearly. This happens because your anxiety attack interrupts the blood flow to the brain, limiting the brainâ€™s ability to interpret what your eyes are seeing. Vertigo also makes it appear like the world is spinning. Simply by closing your eyes, you can concentrate more on your breathing and block out the spinning world.

 When your child ignores you, you might feel intensely annoyed, angry and/or stressed. If you feel this way, take some deep breaths in through the nose and exhale slowly through your mouth until you feel calm again and ready to address the situation., Sometimes, deep breaths may not be enough. If your child is safe to be alone or if they are old enough to be, get away for a moment. Go into the kitchen and run some cold water over your hands or go lie on your bed for a few minutes., If you cannot leave your child, then count to yourself or out loud until you feel calm. This can also help signify to your child that you are reaching your limits and that they need to cease ignoring you immediately., Do something else for the moment to distract yourself from reacting negatively. Sing your favorite song. Vacuum or sweep the floor. Do whatever you can to distract your attention momentarily., Donâ€™t teach your children that they are only supposed to listen when you yell. You need them to know that your words should be respected regardless of how loud you are. You might feel the urge to yell when your child ignores you, but speak firmly and at a regular tone, instead., This will help you keep more calm overall and make you less likely to react when provoked. Spend some time daily taking a hot bath, meditating, practicing yoga, or listening to some relaxing music.

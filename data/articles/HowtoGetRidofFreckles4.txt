 Mineral foundation helps conceal and blend freckles with your natural skin tone. Consult a mineral makeup consultant to determine which foundation color works best for your particular complexion.


Choose a foundation in between your lighter color and the color of your freckles.
Apply the mineral foundation all over with a kabuki brush to get the natural, flawless look mineral makeup is known for.
 This type of foundation is great for people with dry skin. Choose a color slightly lighter than the color of your freckles. Apply the foundation with a cotton ball or makeup applicator, and make sure to blend it well for best results.


Applying a small amount of powder over the foundation helps it set and stay in place all day.
Avoid the temptation to apply more than one layer of foundation. You may end up drawing extra attention to the areas you'd like to cover.

 Have a primary gun, a secondary gun, and a backup gun.


Your loadout should maybe include a melee.






For example, Nerf blasters, Recon, Raider, Longstrike, Stampede, anything from BuzzBee, or anything from Lanard.
If you really want to snipe, get your hands on a Longshot. If you can mod it, that makes sniping a breeze. (Note, it's rare and expensive.)





;
, The mods will make your blasters a lot more powerful.



Pack your small blasters in it. You can also add food.
,,, These will be useful if the war gets dragged out for a while.


Keep your strength up. Bring along bottled water and two or three energy bars.
 You'll need to be fit, able to run and get into hiding spots with ease.



If you want to, have ranks such as Trooper, Defender, and Sniper.






Divide and group into squads of three. The more people you have, the stronger you are.
 You'll need them.
 Know what your opponent's strengths are and find ways to prevent or block them.
 Cover hides and shields you, concealment only hides you.


Do not be loud unless your Nerf gun is. Little noise is good for sneaking, as you won't be heard as easily. Preferably wear socks for this.
 Some of the strategies that you can discuss and analyze with your team ahead of the Nerf war include:


Do not charge directly into a group of enemies. It's just that simple.






Have a camp to fall back to if you get in a jam.






If you see someone with a Vulcan that isn't on your side, sneak up from behind and ambush 'em.
 Everyone should be totally comfortable with the weapons, with concealment and stealthy movement and with the strategies devised.


Break your own team into smaller teams for practice, and play against each other. That way, you can see different perspectives and begin to understand how the opponents are probably thinking.

 These symptoms are normal for the first couple of days after getting a piercing, but if they don't subside soon after that, you may have an infection or allergy.If the earring feels tight, you may just need to pull the earring clutch away from your lobe a bit. If the pain doesn't go away after pulling it back, see a doctor.
Problems caused by allergic reactions can usually be easily resolved by removing the piercing. However, this will cause the hole to heal back up.
If you want to save the piercing, see a doctor, who will be able to treat your ear and advise you on whether it's necessary to take out the piercing.
 Pus discharge, excessive itching, redness, and extreme pain are signs of an infection. Either remove the earring immediately yourself, or if it is too painful, have a doctor remove it. Bathe the infected ear with antibiotic ointment and bandage it until it has healed.
 If your earring snags on something and causes your earlobe to tear, you may need stitches. Go to an immediate care center or the emergency room to have your ear treated right away.

 If you time it right, you can hit department stores during their deep discount periods.The best way to ensure you are there to snag a deal is by simply asking the manager when they do their big markdowns.  Most have a specific day of the month or season when they do this so knowing the date means you will be first in line for the best picks.;
, Kid specific clothing stores such as The Children’s Place and Gap Kids heavily discount items every time a new clothing line moves in.  This usually happens once or twice a season.  Ask them about signing up for email alerts, coupon mailers, and store point cards to get even bigger discounts.  The Children’s Place, for example, offers Monster sales several times a year where you can find clothing and shoes up to 60% off. If you have their online discount codes or printed coupons you get even more of a discount.  If you also have their point card and enough points you can redeem those for a discount on top of that. 

, Basically, there are hundreds of different websites and deals begging for you to save money.So you don’t waste time searching several sites to find what you’re looking for.  Friday’s bring a fresh list of discounts, promo codes, and coupons from all your favorite baby gear stores.  This saves you time and gives you the benefit of knowing about discounted items before you even knew you were looking for them.

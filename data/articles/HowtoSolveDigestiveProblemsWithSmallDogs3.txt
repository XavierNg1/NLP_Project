 If your small dog lacks energy, refuses to eat, passes blood-stained stools, or has a poor appetite and is losing weight, then he or she should see a vet. These could be signs of a severe medical issue.


If the problem is long term, lasting for several days or weeks, and your dog is fed a regular dog food (and you are unable to get to a vet) consider changing his diet. Some dogs have a dietary intolerance and cannot properly digest some of the ingredients in their food., Your vet may want to send it away for analysis and culture to see if any parasites or gut infections are present. This can then point to a specific course of treatment, such as fenbendazole for coccidial infections, or antibiotics for giardia or campylobacter.
 There are a variety of possible diagnoses your vet may give and all of these will have specific treatments. Along with the fecal sample, your vet may take a blood sample to test for common health problems that lead to problems with digestion.


Digestive problems in small dogs can be caused by EPI (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency). This is a lack of the digestive enzymes necessary to digest fat, and can lead to cow-pat like, rancid stools. You vet can diagnose this using a blood test and the treatment is a pancreatic enzyme replacement powder sprinkled on your dog's food.Another common issue is low levels of B vitamin in the bowel wall. B vitamins are vital to good appetite and healthy digestion and sometimes the levels do fall. Again, this is diagnosed with a blood test. The B vitamin needs to be boosted up by four, weekly injections. Unfortunately, oral supplements are less effective because the stomach acid is likely to destroy them.

 For most cars, you can find the VIN in one or more locations:Look on the dashboard, in the far left corner just under the windshield. It is usually easiest to see this from the outside, looking in the windshield.
Look on the front of the engine block. Open the hood and look toward the front of the engine and you should find it on a metal plate.
Look in the rear wheel well on the driver's side. The VIN may be located by looking directly up inside the wheel well.
Look inside the driver's door, either under the side mirror or at the door handle. The VIN may be located either near where the door latches or directly under the side mirror.

 Several commercial companies provide online search engines that will check your VIN. These commercial sites are often more comprehensive than official government-sponsored sites, although they may cost more. Some of the leading commercial sites are Carfax.com, Edmunds.com, CarDetective.com or AutoCheck.com.
 Follow the links on the site you have chosen to enter the VIN of the car you are considering. Be very careful to enter each digit correctly.
 Most commercial sites will charge a fee that ranges from $20 to $50. Some sites will give you a single report for this amount, while some will offer you the option of paying to use their service for several searches or for several months. Choose the option that best suits your needs.
 The full report will give you identification information, accident history for the car, a check of the odometer reading, and a wider range of reported damage or other issues.

The Favor card means the person who played the card picks any opponent to give them a card of the opponent's choice.
The Nope card can be used any time during the game to stop any action except against an Exploding Kitten or a Defuse card.

The Skip card lets you skip your turn without drawing a card.
The Shuffle card lets you shuffle the deck.

Cat cards aren't useful by themselves but can be used in Special Combos or Pairs.

If you have triples (Three of a Kind) of a card with no instructions you get to ask any opponent for any card. If they do not have theÂ card you ask for you get nothing. If they do you get to keep that card.

In Advanced Play, any two or three cards with matching icons in their corners can be played as pairs, rather than only instruction-less cards. And if you have five cards with different icons in the corners (with or without instructions) then you can look through the Discard Pile and grab any card you want.
 The game is won when all but one players have "exploded", or drawn an Exploding Kittens card. The last player left is declared the winner. Have fun!

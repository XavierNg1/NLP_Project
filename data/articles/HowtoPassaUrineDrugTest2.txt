 You'll need a full range of vitamins and healthy drinks to protect from hyperhydration.This method takes at least a week, but it's healthier than overloading your system with water, which can flush out important vitamins, nutrients, and electrolytes. To do a healthy flush, you'll need to constantly replace what is being flushed out. Stock up on the following:


Multi-vitamins
Sports drinks
Fresh fruits and veggies
Tea (green detox tea
Other diuretics (cranberry or apple juice, coffee, etc.)

, Drink 20 to 40 ounces of sports drink per day to restore your electrolytes and keep you hydrated. Drink roughly 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water to flush your body of toxins. Drink the tea and other diuretics throughout the day as well. Do not drink more than 2 gallons (7.6 L) total of fluids per day.
 Replenish your body by taking a multivitamin either once or twice a day, as directed on the packaging.
 Build up as much of a sweat as possible, since sweating is a way to detox your body. The kidneys and the bladder can only filter so much in such a time. Sweating helps the body excrete waste through your pores, as well as your bladder.
 your body will need all the nutrients it can get. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and lean proteins the week before your drug test.
 If you feel sick, you could be taking in too much water in too short a time. Your health is more important than passing the drug test, so don't overdo it.

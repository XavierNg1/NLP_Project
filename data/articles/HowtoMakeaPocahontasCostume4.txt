 Don't go too overboard -- Pocahontas certainly wasn't orange. If your skin is pale, go for a sunkissed look with blushes and bronzers.
 If you made it yourself, all the better! Check out images of Pocahontas online if you want to imitate the Disney character. Hers was blue with a white pendant.


The necklace is a good opportunity to add color to your costume. Consider armbands and bracelets as well, but don't go overboard. Pick one or two accessories. Less is more here.
 If you'd like to make it more manageable, braid it into one or two long braids. Pocahontas doesn't have to have dark hair, but it is the traditional look.


If you have long hair already, you may want to invest in a swimming cap to keep your tresses from sneaking out and putting a damper on your completed look.
 Use the same material you used to make your outfit. Cut three long strands and braid them together, starting with the end knotted.


Braid enough to wrap around your head, but leave loose ends to dangle. You can then attach beads or feathers to the hanging ends to spice up your outfit. Just tie at the base of your head and then again at the bottom of the strands.

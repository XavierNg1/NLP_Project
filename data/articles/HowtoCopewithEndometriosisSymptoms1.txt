 Unfortunately, endometriosis typically comes with chronic pain. One of your most important coping methods is learning not only to control the pain, but understanding it.

If you know that you are having a particularly bad day, try to stay home from work or school so that you can treat your pain effectively.Track your pain and symptoms by keeping a journal. With time, you may be able to predict which days of the month will be your most painful. You can try to avoid scheduling important meetings or social events on those days. There are also apps you can download to help you track your pain.
Pay attention to how pain affects you. By becoming aware of the impact of your pain on your daily life, you will be able to find more effective ways of dealing with it.;
, Medication can be very helpful when reducing the pain caused by endometriosis. There are several over-the-counter pills that you can take. If your pain is severe, you can also ask your doctor to prescribe a medication that you can take on your worst days.A good over-the-counter alternative is using a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

Discuss prescription pain medications with your doctor. Be aware that many of these medications come with side effects such as drowsiness and possible nausea.

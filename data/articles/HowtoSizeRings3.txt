 Then slide the tape over your knuckle so you can be sure the ring will be large enough to fit over your knuckle, too.


Read the measurement off the measuring tape, then use a sizing chart, such as the ones at mg-jewelry.com/ringsizechart.html (inches) or images.zales.com/images/popups/zales_ringsizer.pdf (mm), to convert the measurement to a ring size.
 Cut a slit where marked, wrap the paper band around your finger and poke the end of the band through the slit, pull it firm, and read your ring size where the paper passes through the slit.

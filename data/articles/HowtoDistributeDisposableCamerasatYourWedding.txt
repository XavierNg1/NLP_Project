 This is usually at the door to the chapel. Or, simply designate a table with a "Please Help Us Remember Today Forever" sign that includes instructions about where to return the cameras at the end of the ceremony.;
, Provide markers so your guests can leave special messages or mark on the camera's case. Do not forget to that you will need to differentiate the used cameras from unused.
, Or designate children of a family member or guest. This is a wonderful way for kids will enjoy themselves and feel good about participating in an important part of your day.
 This is perhaps the most cost-effective way to distribute cameras during your wedding as there is better chance of each camera's exposures being used. It also requires fewer cameras than trying to have enough for all your guests, who may only snap a handful of pictures.

 As with the paper choice, be sure to use fabric that is suitable year-round and matches the décor. Of course, if you're happy to change the brick bookends regularly, you could also theme them to a season, such as using Christmas colors for the holiday season, then recovering the bookends post-Christmas. Stronger fabric is advisable, to prevent the likelihood of any rips or wrinkling. Fabric suggestions include:


Fabric direct from your fabric stash, scraps or other pieces
Scarves, old clothing that has been loved but is no longer wearable––a cozy look can be achieved by cutting up and old fluffy sweater
Sarongs or other clothing wraps
Old sheets––put those childhood Spiderman sheets to good use and wrap the bricks in a section that features Spidey.
 Instead of using tape to keep your work together, use a dab or two of liquid nails or silicone cement. You could also use a hot glue gun if you're gluing fabric to fabric. In each case, don't overlap the folded parts too much, to ensure that the brick still sits evenly.


You may want to sew the edges of a cut portion of fabric so they don’t fray or tear as time passes.
 Although optional, you can add additional items to the fabric covered brick, such as tying ribbon bands around each end or gluing on interesting decorations such as buttons, rhinestones, lace, etc.
 Although this step is optional, it will help to keep the fabric clean and make it easier to dust.

 You can find tests online that will help you pinpoint areas in which you have formed biased opinions. Taking such a test can be a great way to learn about your implicit biases. This is the first step to overcoming them., Being uncomfortable in a situation can point to a bias of some kind. Make note of any situations or people that make you feel uneasy. If there are any common threads, this points toward a biased opinion about that particular situation.For example, if being in a restaurant and overhearing a conversation in a language that is not English is unnerving to you, you may be biased against other cultures or immigrants in general.
 Most people think of biases as negative qualities that are assigned to a group of people or situations. This is not always true. A positive bias is a positive trait that is assumed to be present. Positive biases can make people feel that they are only valued for one thing. It can also damage the self esteem of someone who you assume has this positive trait, but actually doesn’t.For example, assuming that all Asians can do math would be a positive bias.
 Your friends, family, or spouse might spot biases that you don’t. If they try to point out that you are being closed minded or stubborn about something, listen. You can also be proactive and ask for their opinions.


For example, you might say something like “I am trying to become more open minded. Are there any particular issues that I seem to be biased on?”

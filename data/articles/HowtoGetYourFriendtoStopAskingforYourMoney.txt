 Is he/she poor, or does he/she just need extra money to go to Subway, buy cough drops, etc? Finding out why the person wants your money is a key first step to assessing the situation.
 Having a conversation about how you feel is key to resolving the situation., Show that you have compassion for the person, especially if he/she is in poverty and in need of a lot of money. For example, you could say "I know you are poor, and I have compassion for you"., Tell the person that you are happy to give some of your money, but you need plenty for yourself as well. Having someone continually ask for your money can be very frustrating and exhausting, but make sure you say it in a sensitive way, rather than being hurtful and harsh. Do not say "I'm so sick and tired of you always asking me for money! I wish you would leave my money alone!" but rather say it like "I understand your situation, and I am happy to give you some of my money, but I can't be giving it to you all the time. I need enough to fend for myself as well"., If the person is poor, suggest that he/she get help from a homeless shelter or from the local government. If the person is just in need of extra money, suggest that he/she get cash from an ATM., Raise your concerns in a firmer way. Tell your friend that you asked him/her to stop asking for your money all the time, but he/she continues to do it, so you will have to end the friendship because you don't want to constantly be taken advantage of all the time.

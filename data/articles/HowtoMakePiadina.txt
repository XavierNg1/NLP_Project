 Knead for 5-10 minutes until smooth in a mixer or by hand. Leave in a cool place (such as the refrigerator) to rest for 2-3 hours, preferably overnight.


This dough will make thin piadina, to make thicker piadina you may add 1 tsp of baking powder to the dough. Rest the dough for only half an hour. Alternatively, you may add 1 teaspoon of yeast, however yeast is not a traditional ingredient and will make your dough more like a pizza.;
, Gently roll out your dough into a circle approx 20cm or 8 inches. To make thin piadina, roll out your dough 2mm or 1/12th of an inch thick.


For thicker piadina, roll out the dough 5mm or 1/5th of an inch. This will make a smaller piadina approx 17cm or 7 inches across.
You may also make 10 small piadina as a hand held party food 10cm or 4 inches across.
 Ideally piadina should be served hot, fresh from the pan, so it is recommended to have your fillings ready for a quick meal.
 Brush the piadina with a little olive oil and add to the hot pan or BBQ. Cook 1-2 minutes each side for thin piadina, until golden brown and crisp. Thick piadina should be cooked more gently for 2-3 minutes.


The barbecue adds a delicious smoky taste to the bread which cannot really be replicated with a frying pan. This makes Piadina an ideal starter or lunch for BBQ parties, or when the weather is too hot to cook indoors.
 Place your filling on half of the piadina, season with salt and pepper and a little extra virgin olive oil if desired. Fold in half to eat similar to a taco, or cut into portions to serve.


Alternatively, you may brush each hot piadina with garlic butter or top with bruschetta or salsa, cut into quarters and serve as a party food at a BBQ.
For sweet Piadina, spread thickly with chocolate or hazelnut spread and enjoy hot.

 If your child has problems grasping simple concepts, you may want to talk to a specialist who can help you to help your child. The specialist you can speak to include:


Special educator: They can help you come up with game plan to give your child as much education as she can receive.
Occupational therapist: They teach the motor skills necessary for your child to function on his own. For example, an occupational therapist can teach your son how to feed himself.
 Even though you love your child more than anyone else in the world, raising a child with physical and mental disabilities can be a challenge. Going to parental counseling can give you the support you need. Counselors can give you tips on making your child’s life as easy as possible, while also giving you time to talk about your own experiences.


You can also consider joining a local support group. It can be really nice to talk to people who are in a similar situation as you are.
 Apert syndrome does not generally limit the physical exercise that your child can get. In fact, physical exercise is really important. Allow your child to get at least 30 minutes of physical exercise a day. This can mean:


Jogging, biking, swimming, walking the dog, or even doing household chores.
 Apert syndrome doesn’t affect your child’s diet. Of course, if your child has allergies, you should make sure to stay away from those foods. Otherwise, its important to give your child a healthy diet. This includes:


Eating lean cuts of meat and fish at least 3 times a week.
Providing sweets in moderation
Dividing meals into 5 smaller, frequent meals rather than eating 3 big meals.
Eating vegetables, fruits, whole wheat products, and low-fat dairy every day.
Opting for more nutritious snacks such as carrots or crackers instead of cookies.

 The formula is simply V = 1/2 x length x width x height. However, we'll be taking this formula apart further to use the formula V = area of base x height. You can find the area of the base by using the formula for finding the area of a triangle -- multiplying 1/2 by the length and width of the base.;
, To calculate the volume of a triangular prism, you need to first find the area of the triangular base. Find the area of the base of the prism by multiplying 1/2 times the base of the triangle times its height.Ex: If the height of the triangular base is 5 cm and the base of the triangular prism is 4 cm, then the area of the base is 1/2 x 5 cm x 4 cm, which is 10 cm2.
 Let's say the height of this triangular prism is 7 cm.
 Simply multiply the area of the base times the height. After you multiply the base and height, you'll have the volume of the triangular prism.


Ex:10 cm2 x 7 cm = 70 cm3


, You should always use cubic units when you're calculating volume because you're working with three dimensional objects. The final answer is 70 cm.3

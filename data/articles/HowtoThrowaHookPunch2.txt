 In boxing, proper form is extremely important. Put both of your legs parallel to your shoulders, then bring your most dominant foot one half of a step back and slightly bend your knees. This will provide you with a pivot point. , Keep your fists in front of your face. Your hands should be lined up a bit outside of your eyes and a few inches away from your face. In this way you can also defend a punch being thrown at you.

 If your morning workout includes something like yoga or just a walk, pop a light snack right after your workout. It doesn’t need to be anything substantial – just enough so your stomach doesn’t rumble.A piece of fruit is a great option for a snack after a light workout.;
, Sixty to ninety minutes of working out greatly depletes your energy stores. The most important thing you can do to refill those stores and get your energy back is to eat a snack high in carbs.A piece of toast with nut butter and some fruit or a bowl of cereal with low-fat milk are good options for this type of post-workout snack.
 If your workout focuses on circuit training or includes a lot of weight lifting, you should eat a snack that has equal parts carbs and protein. Because high-intensity training really works your muscles, having carbs and protein will help your muscles recover, which can leave you feeling more energized.Apples with nut butter, chocolate milk, almonds, cottage cheese and fruit, or a hard-boiled egg or two with whole wheat toast are all great ways to make sure you get carbs and protein after your workout.

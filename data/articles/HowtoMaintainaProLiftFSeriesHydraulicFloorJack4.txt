 Locate the oil filler plug located on top of the hydraulic reservoir (cylinder). Using a flat-head screwdriver gently pry the rubber-plug out of the reservoir (cylinder).



NOTE: The oil filler plug is typically painted the same color as the jack essentially concealing it to make it appear as part of the reservoir assembly when in fact the plug itself is a rubber press-fitted seal.







CAUTION! The hydraulic fluid located inside the reservoir could very well be under pressure when removing the plug. Insure that proper safety equipment is used when performing this step to prevent injury. Also, take necessary steps to prevent loss of the Plug should the pressure eject it from the port.
 Begin adding hydraulic fluid into the reservoir until the fluid level is approximately 3/16" from just covering the inner-cylinder as viewed from the oil filler plug hole.


If too little or too much fluid is added, the jack will experience a wide-range of performance issues. Troubleshooting of the unit may be necessary and damage to the jack may occur if the issues are not properly resolved prior to use.
 Refer to SECTION F: STEPS #02 - #07 to properly bleed the hydraulic system of any trapped air-pockets.

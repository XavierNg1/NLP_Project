 To do this, first click on the "Start" button. In the menu that appears, click on "Control Panel." From the "Control Panel," click on "Folder Options.";
,

, Scroll down until you see an option called "Hidden Files and Folders." There are 2 radio buttons listed underneath this entry; click on the one that reads "Show hidden files, folders, and drives."

, In the same "Advanced Settings" window, uncheck the box that reads "Hide protected operating system files (Recommended)." Do this if the folder you want to unhide is a system folder.
, Even if it is marked as hidden, it will now be visible. You can navigate to the folder's location in Explorer, or you can search for the folder if you're not sure where it is.


To navigate to the folder's location manually, click on "Start," and then click on "Computer." In the Explorer window that opens, double-click on the folders that contain your folder until you are in the right place.
To search for the folder, click on "Start." Just above the "Start" button, there will be a search form. Type all or part of the folder's name into that form, and a list of search results will be dynamically presented. When you see the folder you're interested in, click on it.
 To do this, right-click on the folder in which you're interested. In the context menu that appears, click on "Properties." In the menu that appears, click on the tab that reads "General."

, On the "General" tab of the "Properties" menu, uncheck the box that reads "Hidden." The folder will no longer be hidden. If you want, you can go back into the "Appearances and Personalization" menu and tell Windows to hide the hidden files again. Your folder will appear anyway, because it is no longer marked as hidden.

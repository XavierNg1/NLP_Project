 Recall that, when solving quadratic equations, one method was to factor them, if possible. If factoring did not work, then you could resort to the Quadratic Formula, which would yield the real solutions for any quadratic formula. You can use the Quadratic Formula as another method to find inverse functions.The Quadratic Formula is x=/2a.

Notice that the Quadratic Formula will result in two possible solutions, one positive and one negative. You will make this selection based on defining the domain and range of the function.
 Your quadratic equation must begin in the format f(x)=ax2+bx+c{\displaystyle f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c}. Take whatever algebraic steps you must in order to get your equation into that form.For this section of this article, use the sample equation f(x)=x2+2x−3{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+2x-3}.
 Determine the graph of the function, either by using a graphing calculator or just plotting various points until the parabola appears. You will find that this equation defines a parabola with its apex at (-1,-4). Thus, to define this as a function that will have an inverse, define the domain as all values of x≤-1. The range will then be all y≥-4., To begin finding the inverse, switch the variables x and y. Leave the equation unchanged, except for reversing the variables. At this stage, you will replace x for f(x).Using the working equation f(x)=x2+2x−3{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+2x-3}, this will give the result x=y2+2y−3{\displaystyle x=y^{2}+2y-3}.
 Recall that to use the Quadratic Formula, you must set your equation equal to 0, and then use the coefficients in the formula. Similarly, this method of finding an inverse function begins by setting the equation equal to 0.

For the sample equation, to get the left side equal to 0, you must subtract x from both sides of the equation. This will give the result 0=y2+2y−3−x{\displaystyle 0=y^{2}+2y-3-x}.
 This step is a bit tricky. Recall that the Quadratic Formula solves for x, in the equation 0=ax2+bx+c{\displaystyle 0=ax^{2}+bx+c}. So, to get the equation you currently have, 0=y2+2y−3−x{\displaystyle 0=y^{2}+2y-3-x}, to match that format, you need to redefine terms as follows:Let y2=ax2{\displaystyle y^{2}=ax^{2}}. Therefore, x=1

Let 2y=bx{\displaystyle 2y=bx}. Therefore, b=2

Let (−3−x)=c{\displaystyle (-3-x)=c}. Therefore, c=(-3-x)


, Normally, you would place the values of a, b and c into the Quadratic Formula to solve for x. However, recall that you previously switched x and y for finding the inverse function. Therefore, when you use the Quadratic Formula to solve for x, you are really solving for y, or the f-inverse. The steps of solving the Quadratic Formula will work like this:x=/2a

x=(-2)±√((-2)^2-4(1)(-3-x)) / 2(1)

x=((-2)±√(4+12+4x))/2

x=(-2±√(16+4x))/2

x=(-2±√(4)(4+x))/2

x=-2±2√(4+x))/2

x=-1±√(4+x)

f-inverse = -1±√(4+x)   (This final step is possible because you earlier put x in place of the f(x) variable.)


, Notice that the Quadratic Formula gives two possible results, using the ± symbol. Write out the two separate solutions to make it easier to define the domain and range and make the correct final solution. These two solutions are:f−1=−1+4+x{\displaystyle f^{-1}=-1+{\sqrt {4+x}}}


f−1=−1−4+x{\displaystyle f^{-1}=-1-{\sqrt {4+x}}}


, Notice that, for the square root to be defined, the domain must be x≥-4. Recall that the domain of the original function was x≤-1 and the range was y≥-4. To choose the inverse function that matches, you will need to choose the second solution, f−1=−1−4+x{\displaystyle f^{-1}=-1-{\sqrt {4+x}}} as the correct inverse function., To make sure that your work is correct and your inverse is the right equation, select any value for x and place it into the original equation to find y. Then, put that value of y in the place of x in your inverse equation, and see if you generate the number that you started with. If so, your inverse function is correct.Using the original function f(x)=x2+2x−3{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+2x-3}, choose x=-2. This will give the result of y=-3. Now put the value of x=-3 into the inverse function, f−1=−1−4+x{\displaystyle f^{-1}=-1-{\sqrt {4+x}}}. This turns out the result of -2, which is indeed the value that you started with. Therefore, your definition of the inverse function is correct.

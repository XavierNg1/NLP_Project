 Grab the connector with your thumb and index finger and GENTLY rock the connector up and down and side to side while applying rearward pressure until it comes free from the bulb., The seal is about 4" in diameter and surrounds the back of the bulb. There are 2 tabs that you can use to remove this seal. It may be easier to grab the lower one and pull out and then grab the top one and do the same. It should come out fairly easy using this method. There is no twisting or turning needed to remove this., It crosses over the back of the bulb and is latched on what will be your left side if you are standing facing the car. The bar is latched by a hook so you have to push the bar with your index finger towards the front of the car and then pull up. If done correctly the bar will come away from the bulb., GENTLY grab the back of the bulb and slide it out of it's socket., Make sure it is correctly. A way to make sure it went in the right way is to look at the bulb from outside the headlight while turning it. (may want to plug the light in and turn on the car lights. This will help you see if it is seated in the socket)., Make sure you get the rubber seal back on securely and that it has a good fit over the back of your new bulb., Not sure what it does, but it will definitely be in your way. Use a flat head screwdriver to pop the plastic rivet up. Once the rivet has been freed from the car frame, grab the air vent and GENTLY slide it up and out.,

 Add the sugar and a few tablespoons of water.
 Cook to reduce the berries and sugar to a thickened sauce. This will take around a quarter of an hour.
 Strain the liquid through a strainer into a bowl to remove seeds.
 Then add the icing/powdered sugar and the vanilla. Mix well until a smooth icing mixture forms.

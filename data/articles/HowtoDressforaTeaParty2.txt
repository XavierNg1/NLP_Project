 Many children's tea parties will have a specific costume theme, such as princesses or storybook characters. To make sure your child doesn't feel left out, try to get a firm grasp on the dress code. If the invitation doesn't list one, call the host/hostess and find out what's recommended.
 Most children's tea parties are centered on a dress-up theme. Here are a few ways to gather items for your child to wear:


Search your own closet. Do you have anything that you wouldn't be heartbroken to lose? Common items you might use include ties, long slips, blouses, belts and scarves.
Look around consignment or thrift stores. Thrift stores can be prime locations to find outrageous hats, coats and shoes for your child to dress up in.
Check out party supply shops. If you're looking for items such as feather boas, plastic tiaras, wands, capes, or fairy wings, visit your local party supply store or check out one online. Most sell dress-up staples like these.
 Long strings of pearls, gaudy clip-on earrings, and fake rings can be fun accessories to add to a child's tea party outfit. Raid your own jewelry box for inexpensive pieces, or check out a party supply store.
 Because the tea party is a special occasion, it might be fun to style your child's hair accordingly. Boys could have their hair slicked back or spiked with pomade, while girls could have ringlets, intricate braids, or grown-up looking up-dos.
 If it's an adult and child tea party, consider matching outfits for fun. Solid color dresses are easy to match up using accessories.

 Scream, act like a baby, throw tantrums. Kick, sob. At least do something to get out your anger. Cry until you don't have a single tear left. Get everything out.;
, Look around you- make a list of who truly cares about you. Think family, friends, teachers, classmates, co-workers, neighbors, religious leaders, etc. These people care about you.
 If you feel like you can't talk to anyone, get a teddy bear. Teddy bears, unlike people, will never betray you, turn their back, or walk away. They will give you their undivided attention and a shoulder to cry on. Tell them everything, even those unpleasant details you wish you could just forget.
 You could start from the day you met, or from the second she gave you the silent treatment. Just pick a place and go for it.
 Do the bad times really outweigh the good times?

, Sit on the couch and eat chocolate. Watch TV until your eyes burn out. Take long, hot baths and use every bath oil you can buy.
 Remember the good things and acknowledge the bad, but remember that there's more to life than that person.
 It's okay to grieve, and you probably will, but, eventually, you will have to move on. You can't go over every second of your relationship, analyze everything you've ever said to that person. It'll only make it worse.
 There will always be a little part of you that will never fully heal. And you just have to accept that.
 Maybe you will find a potential new best friend.

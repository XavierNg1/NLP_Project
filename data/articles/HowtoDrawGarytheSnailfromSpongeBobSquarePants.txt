 This will be Gary's shell. It should look like the outline of a face at this point, but don't be unnerved; Gary's shell is just unusually tall.;
, Gary's a fairly thin snail, so don't puff him up any more than necessary, and make sure he lies flat on the ground.
 Connect them to the body using thin rectangles. Gary's eyes are actually similar to Mr. Krabs', so keep that in mind as you complete this step.
 Add detail to his shell by drawing a swirl then five small ovals above it.
 Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. This will make your drawing look better and more professional. Also erase any remaining sketch lines.
 Use pink and purple for the shell, and shades of green and light blue for his body and blue eye stems and green eye rings with a red pupil and There you go, Gary the Snail!

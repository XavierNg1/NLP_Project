 Stain removers such as OxiClean and Mr. Clean Magic Eraser are readily available at grocery and drug stores. These are designed to remove tough stains like ink, dirt, and other stains.


Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions when using these products.
 Put a small amount of the cleaning product on an inconspicuous spot on the fabric. Rinse the fabric and let it dry.
 Make sure the stained area is not resting on another part of the fabric. Place a towel underneath the area on which you’re working. This will ensure that the ink stain will not run through the fabric and stain more of the fabric.
 Following the instructions on the cleaner’s packaging, apply cleaner to the stain. Let the cleaner sit for 1-5 minutes to soak into the stain and to allow it to work on dissolving the ink.


If you are using OxiClean, mix some of the powder with water to make a paste. Follow the instructions on the package for the correct proportions.
 Choose a cloth that you don’t mind getting stained, since the ink will transfer to this cloth. Blot gently by pressing the cloth into the stained area. Do not rub it around or scrub, as this can spread the stain.


Keep turning the cloth over to a fresh surface so that you are not transferring ink back onto the fabric., Use lukewarm water to rinse the fabric thoroughly. You may need to rinse several times. Let the fabric dry.

 Increase your chances of successfully removing the slivers by removing them in a well-lit area. The thin fiberglass fibers are a white or light yellow color. They can be hard to see when stuck in your skin.;
, You want a tape, like duct tape or electrical tape, that will not rip into pieces when it is pulled. You also want a tape that has a lot of glue to stick to the fiberglass splinters.
 This technique works best if the tape can get a solid hold on the fiberglass splinters. Water will make the fiberglass slivers soft and harder to pull out of your skin.
 Hold the tape in place for several minutes with your hand. Make sure the tape makes good contact with your skin and the fiberglass splinters.
 Ripping the tape off in a sudden or jerky fashion could take some skin with it, or create sores. This will make the fiberglass slivers even harder to remove. Grip the tape as close to your skin as possible and peel it up and away from your skin. It may be necessary for you to repeat this step several times.


Remember that the tape you are using is not made to be gentle on your skin. Therefore, you will have to take extra care removing it.
Check the area under the light or with the magnifying glass to make sure all the fiberglass is gone. Rub the area gently with clean hands to feel for anything sharp or tender. This could be a sign that you still have fiberglass in the area.
 Pat the area dry. Apply an antibiotic ointment like Neosporin to prevent infection.It is normal for bacteria or germs to be on the outer layer of our skin. However, the nicks made in your skin by the fiberglass splinters could allow germs or bacteria to get under the skin, which could lead to a skin infection.

 Using weight machines, lifting free weights, and doing bodyweight exercises are all considered strength-training. Many studies over the years have shown that resistance or strength training can increase bone density, as well as influence risk factors for osteoporosis, such as balance, strength, and muscle mass.Bodyweight exercises can be a great way to get into strength training. For instance, get in the habit of doing a couple sets of push-ups before you get in the shower. To start, try to do two sets of five push-ups each. If you do some every day, you’ll be doing two sets of twenty push-ups in no time.
 If you find you enjoy strength training, it’s important to schedule your workouts to alternate working on different muscles. Train one muscle group at a time (upper body, core, and lower body), and rotate muscle group that you’re exercising roughly twice a week. Avoid exercising the same muscle group two days in a row.Keep a tangible or electronic journal to help you keep track of your routine, and to record your progress.
 Flexibility and balance are also extremely important to bone health. At the very least, follow up weight-bearing or strength-training exercises with stretching.In addition to increasing your flexibility and balance, stretching will also help you prevent injury.
Consider taking a yoga class and plan to try one out after one of your strength training workouts.

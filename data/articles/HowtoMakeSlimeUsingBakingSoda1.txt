 Add seven tablespoons of non-fat or skim milk to a glass or bowl. The fat in whole milk may not result in the right texture, so do not substitute whole milk or 2% milk for skim milk.





;
, Stir one tablespoon of vinegar into your milk. This is enough to cause the protein from milk to separate from the liquid. Adding the vinegar raises the acidity of the liquid and forces the protein out of solution.








Solid chunks of milk begin to form as the milk reacts to the vinegar. These chunks should slowly sink to the bottom of your glass as the reaction occurs.
 Once the chunks of milk have settled at the bottom, pour the solution through a coffee filter. The liquid will move through the filter and leave only the chunks of milk behind. Pat the chunks of milk with a paper towel to make sure they are dry and to squeeze out any excess water. Transfer the solids to a clean mixing bowl.
 After moving the chunks of milk to a bowl, add Â¼ tablespoon (about 4 mL) of baking soda. The baking soda will help to pull the proteins together and give a more solid consistency. Your mixture will start to resemble slime. Mix the baking soda into the milk until you have a mixture that resembles vanilla pudding.








Depending on how big your chunks of milk were, you may need to add more baking soda. If you're having trouble getting a vanilla pudding mixture, sprinkle in small amounts of baking soda until you get the right consistency.
 A few drops of green food coloring will turn your slime green. Add a few drops and stir it in. If you want the green color slightly darker, add more green food coloring.
 Once your slime is done, you can play with it. You can try to shape it using your hands. You can also use it to decorate something like a diorama. Use slime, for example, to represent a murky pond in a forest.









Make sure not to get your slime anywhere near your mouth. It is not safe to eat.

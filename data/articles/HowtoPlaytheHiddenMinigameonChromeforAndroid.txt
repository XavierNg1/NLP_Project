 It doesn't matter which of the two you download, although it is interesting to know that in the past, this minigame was available only on Chrome Beta. Whichever app you choose, however, Android 4.0 Jellybean or later is required to install either apps.;
, This minigame is only accessible when you're offline.
 If you're not connected to the internet or mobile data, the "You are offline" page should appear.
 You control the cute little dinosaur running towards the cacti. Tap the screen to make him jump over and avoid the plants. Points are collected as he runs and the game progressively speeds up every 100 points. The game ends when he touches a cactus (ouch!) but you can keep playing to try to beat your high score.


Note that your high score is kept during your session. Closing the app and letting it run in the background won't reset your high score, but killing the app process will.

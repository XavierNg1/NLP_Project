 No person should fight their battles alone. Dealing with feeling stigmatized means that not only are you having to handle something the world deems as unacceptable, but you have to deal with the world on top of it. It can be quite a weight on your shoulders. Because of this, consider starting therapy. Millions of people try it, and millions of people are helped every year.


Find a mental health counselor in your area by searching the American Psychological Association’s Psychologist Locator. You can also ask friends or family for referrals.
 If therapy isn't up your alley, consider joining a support group. Having a network of like-minded, sympathetic individuals can have a similar effect to that of therapy. You'll have a platform to talk about your stigma and the issues that arise from it. You will gather strength from those around you. You may be able to give others strength as well.
 If applicable, seek help for problems that arise as a result of feeling stigmatized. Plenty of stigmatized conditions don't necessarily need treatment, but some people could benefit from guidance on how to best handle social pressures. It's not because the condition is shameful and wrong. It will just make your life easier. These are complicated problems to deal with. If the stress associated with them can be alleviated to some degree, why not do so?


For example, if you're obese, consider a weight management program for your health. If you're dyslexic, consider working with a learning specialist. The professionals you work with can also give you some advice on how to make your path easier. After all, they also deal with this every day.
 Studies have shown that calming techniques like meditation, yoga, and even deep breathing exercises can help individuals cope with stigma. When you’re calm and feeling relaxed, the stigma doesn't get to you as much. So find a nice, relaxing, quiet place, and clear your mind. It may be the start to the inner peace you are looking for.

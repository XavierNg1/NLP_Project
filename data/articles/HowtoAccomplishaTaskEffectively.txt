 Always start fresh. Prioritize your objectives, draw out your options, and decide where to start.;
, Now that you've prioritized your tasks, create a schedule. Be careful in how you do this however, don't make your schedule too tight, and don't make it too loose.
 Completing tasks/goals is like building a pyramid. First you draw out your blueprint. Then you gather your materials, you mould your brick, and then you build the base. After you have a base laid, you build a smaller layer on top of that, and a smaller layer on top of that, etc.
 You won't get anything accomplished if you're falling asleep on the job. Therefore, get at least 8 hours of sleep a night, and take a minimum 15 minute break every 4 hours.
 Sometimes you get so caught up in trying to get something done, you miss the obvious. So if you get stumped, try to get the opinion of a trusted friend, co-worker or even teacher if possible.
 When a racer sees the finish line, he doesn't slow down. He uses the energy he was saving the entire race to finish strong.

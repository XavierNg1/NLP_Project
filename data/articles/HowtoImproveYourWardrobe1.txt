 Separate the clothes you love from the clothes you hate and the clothes you feel neutral about.;
, Some pieces may have sentimental value, but oftentimes, you love clothing that makes you look good.


Study the pieces that you love for similarities in style and shape.
Hold a personal fashion show for yourself. If you feel uncertain about why you love a certain piece or outfit, try it on and examine yourself in a full-length mirror.
 If you hate it and no longer wear it, keeping it will only worsen your overall opinion about your wardrobe.


Throw out clothing with holes or stains.
Donate clothes that are in good condition to your local thrift store or second-hand store.
Box up clothing that has sentimental value. Some pieces may mean something to you, even if you hate the way they look on your body. If you cannot bear parting with a piece for sentimental reasons, store it in a box kept separate from your wardrobe.
 Determine what pieces look good on you and which do not.


Dispose of clothing that makes you look frumpy and clothing that ages you.
Hang on to bland clothing that fits you well or has potential. These pieces can be spiced up.
Keep a few comfort pieces. A loose t-shirt or a pair of sweatpants may not be fashion forward, but they are good clothes to wear if you plan on lounging around the house all day. As long as these pieces do not rule your wardrobe, having one or two won't hurt.

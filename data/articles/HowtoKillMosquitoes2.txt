 DEET is the most effective pesticide for repelling mosquitoes, but it will only last a few hours at most, and can kill beneficial insects in your yard as well.Other insecticides may cause less collateral damage, but tend to be less effective, shorter lasting, and/or designed to work on clothing rather than large areas.



Check the label to see if the pesticide is approved for the intended use by the Environmental Protection Agency or another regulatory organization., The one plant proven to repel mosquitoes is the lantana plant, but be aware that this can be poisonous to pets, can cause allergic reactions, and is an invasive species in some areas.Other plants may have a minor effect, but try these only if you enjoy them in your garden or are willing to plant a large quantity:



Citronella, lemon grass, any citrus fruit, basil, rosemary, mint, or catnip may all have a minor effect.
 Bug zapper traps can seem effective because of loud sounds, bright lights, or sparks. However, most of the insects killed are not mosquitoes, and they can even kill insects that would normally eat or compete with mosquitoes.Ultrasound devices are simply not effective.Some mosquito-killing traps work using a fan system, very similar to the homemade trap described above. These can be effective, at least temporarily., Mosquitoes tend to avoid smoke, and will be blasted away by a strong fan. Dinner on the patio might not be as pleasant if you are sitting in a smoke cloud or wind tunnel, but if you only care about keeping them away for the next few minutes, this is one option.



Citronella candles are mostly effective due to the smoke, not the scent.Any candle will work almost as well.

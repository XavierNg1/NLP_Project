 Aim for the "sweet spot," about 4 inches (10.2Â cm) above the bottom tip of the football. Where you make contact with the ball is important because it allows you to manipulate the distance and height that the football will travel.
 By using the bone on the top of your foot, you are able to produce the maximum transfer of energy to the ball.









There are two types of kicking, straight and soccer-style. Almost all professional football players use the soccer-style kick.
A straight kick simply means that after you make contact with the ball, your leg follows through in a straight line perpendicular to the ground. Straight-on kickers lock their ankles while kicking, allowing them to efficiently transfer kinetic energy forward.
A soccer kick occurs when you swing your leg through to the opposite side of the ball that you kicked after making contact. Soccer-style kickers angle their foot at an obtuse angle, causing some of energy to be absorbed by the ankle joint. Test out both to see which you prefer, but remember that modern convention points to the soccer kick as the better of the two styles., Once you make contact with the football, don't stop the forward motion of your foot. Instead, try to continue the kicking motion until well after the ball has left your foot.
 You do not need to change the power you put into your kick much even if you are kicking a long field goal. The power in your kick comes from your plant leg and the momentum of your kicking leg.
 This will occur naturally as a result of the forward momentum of your body and your body's effort to keep you on balance.

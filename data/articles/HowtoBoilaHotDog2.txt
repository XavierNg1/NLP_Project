 Make sure the bowl is large enough to hold the amount of hot dogs you want to cook. A glass or plastic microwave-safe bowl works fine.
 This will prevent the dogs from bursting in the microwave. Make a lengthwise slit through the skin of each hot dog you're cooking.
 Check the dogs after 1 minute to determine if they need more time by cutting off the tip of a hot dot to see if it's thoroughly heated. If it needs more time, continue cooking in 30 second increments until they're fully heated.


You can also check to see if it needs more time by looking at the texture of the hot dog; if the skin looks wrinkled and darker in color, it's probably done.
If you're cooking more than a few hot dogs, they will need an extra minute or two to fully heat.
 Use a fork to remove them from the hot water and drain the dogs on a paper towel before serving.

 If you are spraying, get close to the wall and saturate the entire brick area you plan to clean. For individual bricks, add one or two bricks (depending upon the bucket size) to the bucket.
 Move in a counter clock wise motion and then clockwise to lift and remove dirt, debris and stains. If you are cleaning individual bricks, pick up bricks one at a time and scrub. Then return to mixture for further cleaning.


Use toothbrush to get inside small cracks or hard to reach areas.
 This will allow the mixture to soak deeper into the brick following the first scrubbing.


Re-scrub if necessary upon brick inspection.
 For a brick wall, keep a large spray bottle filled with water and hit the wall after its been cleaned. Follow with a clean dry cloth to lift and remove any debris. Individual bricks can be submerged in a bucket of clean water, removed and then allow to dry naturally (or in the sun).

 Being sleep-deprived can lead to anxious snacking and overeating. A good nightâ€™s sleep can reduce your cortisol levels, the hormone that rises when you are anxious or stressed. Avoid stress eating by committing to eight hours of sleep a night., Most alcohol can make you hungry and lead to overeating. Enjoy a glass of wine or beer at the end of your meal, instead of before or during the meal. This way you will be drinking on a full stomach and be less likely to be hungry later or end up wanting to snack late at night., Make a rule that your kitchen is off limits after dinner, or at least two hours before bed. If you struggle with hunger during the day, avoid the kitchen or any area in your home that has food.Wrap up snacks and place them in cupboards and out of sight. Put candies or sweets in colored or covered dishes in hard to reach areas. This will help you avoid temptation and take your mind off your hunger.

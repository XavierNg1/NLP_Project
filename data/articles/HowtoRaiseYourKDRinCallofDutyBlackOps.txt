 It usually helps to play against Bots, on normal difficulty. This gives you time to find out what guns you are the most comfortable using, and what attachments and perks you should use. When you start winning frequently, make the settings harder, put it on hardened and after that veteran, because the bots are more harsh and skilled than any human player. This will make you think and sharpens your reflexes.;
, This does not work. The best you can do with it is to move constantly. In the beginning levels try to use the MP5k.(Note: the MP5k has a high rate of fire, is very accurate, and works very well.)

, Check your corners and keep an eye on your radar. NOTE: Radar is your best friend, use it. It tells you where all the enemies are!

, Try checking your corners and using flash, concussion and even the smoke grenades, but save your lethal. Even the Willy Pete smoke grenade causes a small amount of damage to your enemies when it lands close to them.
 Most of the time it gets you killed because you have to try to line up the shot and account for distance. It's a sneak weapon, not a frontal assault weapon.
 Team work is essential. It also gives your enemies someone other than you to shoot at, increasing your chances of survival.
 Diving makes you a target to enemies, because you cannot fire during the diving phase.
 This is a waste of a secondary weapon. Use Scavenger, so you don't run out of ammo for your primary.
 This is a waste of time because it is extremely inaccurate, and gets you killed if you happen to miss the first shot or it doesn't kill the enemy.
, Feel free to use them in private matches, but don't use them on-line because they do not stand up to machine gun fire, and take longer to travel.
 If they are not, then that can possibly hurt your KDR. When starting out it is a good idea to use the Spy Plane, Care Package, and the Sentry Gun or the Mortar Strike.

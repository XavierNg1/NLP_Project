 Hot water comes with several risks including a drop in blood pressure, dizziness and poor balance, nausea and vomiting, and it dries out your skin which leads to dehydration. Warm water will still relax you and protect you from potential dangers. If you aren't sure how to tell if the water is too hot, you can buy a rubber duck specially designed for bath water temperature control. They have an indicator that changes color when the water is too hot. You can find them at most places baby merchandise is sold.
 If you decide to add products to your bath, put them in while you are filling the tub with water. This will help them dissolve and spread throughout the entire bath water.


If you have sensitive skin, make sure you read the instructions on your bath products to see what type of risks there are. You may want to test a small amount on your hand before you use it on your entire body.
 You do not want to overflow your tub and end up with water on your bathroom floor. Remember that water rises when you enter the tub so filling it up half way should be just enough. Also, if you are using bubbles, the tub will be even fuller as the bubbles fluff up.


You can always add more water if you want once you get into the tub.

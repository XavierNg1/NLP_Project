 Even if you are careful, there is still a chance that some dust might get into your skin. This dust is caustic, and it can cause burns.
 One 80-pound (36.3-kilo) bag will need 5 quarts (4.7 liters) of water. If you will need more mortar for your project, then you will have to adjust the water accordingly.
 If you don't own a mortar mixer, then pour the water into a large, plastic, mixing tub. At this point, you can also add your liquid cement color to the water, if you are using it.
 If you are using a mixer, simply turn it on and let it run. If you are doing this by hand: brace your foot or knee against the side of the plastic tub. Stick the blade of the hoe into the mortar, and drag it towards yourself. Keep dragging the hoe through the mortar in this fashion.
 As you continue to add water and mix, the mortar will get softer and mushier. Don't worry if it doesn't look or feel right after this last bit of mixing. There is still one more step you need to do.
 This will allow the aggregate to get fully soaked.
 Dip your trowel into the mortar, then pull it out. Flick it downward to shake off any mortar clinging to it. Hold the trowel at a 90Â° angle. If the mortar clings to it, it has the right consistency.

 A tonsillectomy is a relatively simple and effective procedure. It is relatively low-risk, and the recovery period is often short, with throat pain and minor bleeding being the most common concerns.If your doctor is concerned about your medical history, age, or other factors, they may advise you to go another route.
Keep in mind that a tonsillectomy would only be recommended for someone with recurrent or very stubborn or complicated tonsil stones.
You can also ask your doctor about removing your tonsil stones. Your doctor may be able to remove them using special irrigation equipment.
 Different antibiotics, such as penicillin or erythromycin, may be used to treat tonsil stones, but they fail to reverse the underlying cause of tonsil stones, which is food being caught in the tonsils. There may be a relapse, and antibiotics may also have adverse side-effects. Most antibiotics kill off beneficial bacteria in the mouth and gut which would help do battle against the problem bacteria., The tissue that deep tonsil pockets are made of can be removed via laser. Laser resurfacing smoothes out the surface of the tonsils so that they no longer have pockets and craters. This procedure is not without risks of its own, however.

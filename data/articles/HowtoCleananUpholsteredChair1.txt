 Use your fingers to remove large debris from your chair before you vacuum it. Be sure to also check crevices in your chair for foreign matter that can clog your vacuum. Finally, brush off extra dust or loose dirt off your chair before you vacuum it., If you have a vacuum attachment for upholstery use it. Alternatively use a nozzle/hose attachment or a brush attachment. You can also vacuum with a handheld vacuum.
 Use short, overlapping strokes. Start your strokes at the top of the chair and work your way down. This technique will help lift dirt, especially from nappy material, like velvet and corduroy.Vacuum in the crevices around cushions and also underneath them (if they are removable).
Set the suction to low for delicate fabrics like silk or linen.

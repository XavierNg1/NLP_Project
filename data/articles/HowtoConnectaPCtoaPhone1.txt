 This is the cable you'll usually use to charge the phone.;
,, This should go into your phone's charging port; usually, you can find this opening on the bottom of your phone.


Some old models of phones have the charging port on their sides. If you can't find your phone's charging port, consult your user manual.
 The USB end plugs into a slim rectangular port on the side of your computer (laptop) or the CPU unit (desktop). This port should have a three-pronged symbol next to it; in some cases, you will also see a lightning bolt-shaped symbol here too.
 After a few seconds, you should see a pop-up window asking what you would like to do with your device.


You can also open "My Computer" and double-click your phone's icon beneath the "Devices and Drives" heading.
 Usually, these include:



Get your stuff on your PC, tablet, and phone - Synchronize your phone's data with your computer.

Import photos and videos - Store your camera roll items on your computer.

Open device to view files - View the photos and videos on your device (similarly to a USB flash drive).

Take no action - Ignore the device. Your PC may continue to charge your phone if you select this option.
 You have successfully connected your PC and your phone!

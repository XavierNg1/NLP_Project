 If you’re going to be cooking with hot peppers and you don’t wear gloves, you may get what are called “hot pepper hands.”


Your hands will burn and sting, and you should take care not to touch your eyes after your hands contact chili oil! The best solution is to wear vinyl or latex gloves.
You can be burned similarly by Thai chilis, serranos, or habaneros.The burning comes from the chili oils and capsaicin that is contained in the peppers. It would be even worse if you touched your eyes with contact lenses in. You’ll have to deal with a burning sensation that is uncomfortable.
 Don’t have gloves lying around? It’s better to make gloves out of things you have lying around than to go without.


Put a plastic sandwich baggie over your hands before you cut the peppers. You might want to fasten it to your wrist with a rubber band.
If you don't have gloves or plastic baggies, wrap your hands in paper towels - anything to prevent the chili oil from contacting bare skin.
To protect your eyes, wear clear safety glasses and always wash your hands and nail beds thoroughly after handling hot peppers.
 It’s not fun to have a burning mouth, but there’s some evidence that eating chili peppers on a regular basis is good for your health.Instead of reaching for the sugar, when your energy is lagging, reach for the chili peppers!
However, just because you reduce the burning sensation in your mouth doesn’t mean that you won’t still get the metabolic boost from the capsaicin in the peppers; you likely will since the liver enzymes break it down.
Capsaicin can increase both energy and metabolic levels, helping you to lose weight and generally be healthier.

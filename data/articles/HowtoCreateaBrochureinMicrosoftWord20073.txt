 On the Margins tab, under Orientation, select "Landscape" so that your document has more space horizontally.
 Under Margins, set Top and Bottom margins to .5, and then set Left and Right margins to .25. By default, there is a half-inch gap between columns, so by entering these settings, the columns will be centered on each panel.
 Click OK.
 Repeat until the insertion point is at the top of the sixth column.
 On the "Insert" tab in the "Illustrations" group, click an object such as a picture or graphic. You can also drag a picture from a folder on your computer.


You can also set up a tri-fold/theme related brochure using templates. Under Microsoft Office Online, in the left navigation panel, click "Brochures." Select the template you want and click "Download." You can then modify any of the placeholder objects such as Text Boxes, Pictures and Shapes.

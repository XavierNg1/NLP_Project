 This should always be the first step when taking on any plumbing project in your home.


Also have some rags and a bucket handy in case you need to clean up water quickly.
 There are several different ways the spout could be connected, depending on how it is internally connected to the plumbing.


Look for set screws on the top or bottom of the spout.This will indicate that you have a slip-on spout. This type will slip off easily once the set screw is removed.
If your spout doesn't have a set screw, then it is probably a screw-on style spout. Rotate the spout counterclockwise, being cautious and gentle but holding onto it firmly with a wrench if need be.
 If it looks to be in good shape, with no rusting or cracks, then it does not need to be replaced. Measure how far it comes out of the wall. This will help you when buying your replacement faucet spout.
 Make sure that whatever you buy will fit onto your existing plumbing or buy whatever fittings will make a new secure connection between your old plumbing and your new spout.


There are two basic kinds of spouts, one's with diverters and ones without.The diverter directs water to a shower head, instead of out the lower spout. If your old spout had a diverter, be sure that the one you buy has one as well.
 Follow the manufacturer's directions, making sure that your connections are secure and sealed well.
 If you have a leak, check that the connection points you just made are tight enough and try it out again.

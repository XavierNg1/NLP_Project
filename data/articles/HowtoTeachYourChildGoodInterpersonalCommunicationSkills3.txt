 One of the easiest ways to help your child understand nonverbal communication is by simply explaining it to them. When you see that your child has missed a nonverbal signal, stop them and let them know what is going on.If, for example, your child doesn’t recognize that wide eyes mean fear, let them know that big eyes and restricted pupils may indicate that a person is afraid or uncomfortable.
 Sharing and playing together requires a host of nonverbal skills as well as verbal skills, and helps foster trust and understanding. Encourage your child to share with their siblings, friends, and peers.Demonstrate both verbal and nonverbal means of sharing. Ask your child, “Would you like to try this?” on some occasions, and on others offer something to them without words.
 Teach your child the importance of looking people in they eyes when they speak by getting on their level and looking them in the eyes when you speak to them. Likewise, when they speak to you, ask them to look you in your eyes.Explain to your child that it is polite to look others in the eyes because it shows they have your attention and that you are listening carefully.
 When you and your child are in a place where you can see others interacting, encourage them to observe the nonverbal commutation between others. Ask them questions, and let them analyze the situation for themselves.

If, for example, you are at the store with your child, you could ask them if people in the check-out line seem happy, and let them explain why or why not.

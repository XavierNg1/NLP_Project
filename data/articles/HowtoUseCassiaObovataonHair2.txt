 Your 'Cassia obovata' may not be cassia at all if it is premixed. If Cassia obovata is not on the ingredients list, but Cinnamomum cassia is, you've got the wrong type of cassia. Look at the other ingredients. Are there any metallic dyes? What about herbs? It is important to research any additional ingredients and their effects.Always strand test premixed cassia!;
, Read them very carefully. You may add in herbs, but if you do, remember to strand test!

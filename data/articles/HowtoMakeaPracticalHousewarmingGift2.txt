 Before you fill the container, you need to know the size and amount you can add. Consider purchasing a container that can also be re-purposed and used later to hold a variety of items but something that isn’t so big the homeowner will need to find a place for storage.


Make sure the container either has a lid or can be sealed. You can also seal the top with a piece of fabric and ribbon if you fall in love with the container and think the homeowner will too.
 Gather items to fit inside the container and envision everything someone might need during those initial days in a new home. Consider making a list before you shop and possibly bring the container along for the shopping spree to ensure everything fits inside.


Consider going with a theme for your gift, such as a picture hanging theme. Purchase everything needed to hang multiple pictures/paintings in the home including a mini hammer or small electric screwdriver.
Don’t over-spend on items, especially if you aren’t sure whether the homeowner already owns the item or not. For example, don't purchase the top-of-the-line screwdriver in the event the homeowner already has one (or may have one in storage or packed in boxes).
 This item will hopefully be positioned front and center inside the jar so make sure it is sized accordingly and fits amongst the other items.

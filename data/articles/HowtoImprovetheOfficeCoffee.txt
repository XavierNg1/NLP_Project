 For coffee lovers, office java may taste weak, like coffee-flavored water. The solution use two bags or one and a half bags of the pre-measured ground coffee to make a single pot of coffee. The extra bag yields a stronger brew with more flavor and taste.;
, Improve the flavor with half-and-half cream instead of powdered milk. You can even heat the milk or cream in the microwave for extra body and warmth.
 Some of the instant coffee on the market tastes even better than brewed coffee, and can save you a lot of money.
 Vanilla, powdered cinnamon, nutmeg or a dash of chocolate add extra flavor. Keep some in your top desk drawer for frugal use over time. Or get all staff to pitch in to keep an office-wide supply.
 Forget the office-issued Styrofoam or paper cups. Coffee tastes better in a ceramic mug. Keep an elegant teacup and saucer at your desk for coffee breaks; the vessel improves the experience and makes break time more enjoyable.
 Use the free hot water from the office and supply your own bags of herbal, green or gourmet tea. Better yet, ask work to supply tea as well as coffee as part of the free drinks.
 Hold your nose, drink the coffee and consider yourself lucky that you have a job and free coffee.

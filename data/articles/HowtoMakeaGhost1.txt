 Create a base out of 8 oz (250 ml) paper drinking cups. Place the first cup on the table upside-down and stack the second cup, right-side-up, on top of the first.


If the structure seems unstable, you can strengthen it by taping the cups together. You only need this structure temporarily.;
, Inflate a small balloon and rest it inside the mouth of the top cup. The bottom should sit inside the cup, but the top should remain sticking out.


The color balloon you use does not matter since it will only be used temporarily.
Balloons meant for use as water balloons usually create the right size.
 The ends can be ragged. If anything, ragged ends will create a more realistic ghost.


Choose white cheesecloth over off-white or beige colors.
 Dunk the cheesecloth into a bowl of fabric stiffener, coating each side well.


Work quickly.
Pour the fabric stiffener into a wide, low bowl to make this process as easy as possible.
 As soon as you remove the cheesecloth from the fabric stiffener, you must drape it over the balloon placed in your paper cup stand.


The sides of the cheesecloth do not need to be precisely even, but they should be fairly similar in length.
Let the fabric stiffener on the cheesecloth dry. This should take about 10 minutes.
 Stick a needle through the cheesecloth to pop the balloon.


A hardened "ghost" shape should be left behind. Remove it from your paper cup stand.
 Use craft glue to fix two black felt circles on the ghost for eyes.


Let the glue dry.
Use your fingers to gently spread out and roughen the edges for a more ghost-like appearance.
Thread fishing line, thread, or twine through the top of the ghost. Tie a knot and hang it up as a decoration.

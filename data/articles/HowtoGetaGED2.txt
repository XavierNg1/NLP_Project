 Several months you plan to take the GED, begin studying for the test using a GED preparation book or online resources.


Begin by taking a practice test. This will show you which areas you should target for further studying.
 That is the main key to GED success. Every day at the same time, sit down at the same place and study hard!

, Most communities have adult education programs that are often connected to finding employment or entering a certification program or college.

GED preparation courses are available at many community colleges and literacy centers. They provide tips on how to study for the test, more information on what to expect, and additional practice tests. Search http://www.acenet.edu/resources/GED/center_locator.cfm to find preparation courses in your area.






If it isn't convenient for you to sign up for a GED preparation class in person, consider taking one online.
 It's not easy to concentrate for over seven hours straight. It's important to strategize ways to get through the test before you walk into the testing center.

Practice, practice, practice. Get used to the feeling of sitting down and taking the tests while you time yourself.






Talk with people who have taken the GED about what to expect, and ask them for tips.






Most importantly, be prepared. If you've studied for each subject test and done well during your practice tests, you'll be just fine on testing day.

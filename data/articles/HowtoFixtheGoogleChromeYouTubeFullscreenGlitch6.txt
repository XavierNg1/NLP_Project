 Some Chrome users report that their full screen issues went away when they disabled the Adobe Flash Player.YouTube no longer requires Flash, but disabling the player will affect other sites you visit that still use it.


Make sure you’re using the latest version of Chrome before attempting this method.
 Just type that exact path into the address bar and hit ↵ Enter or ⏎ Return. The Plugins page will appear., If you do, you’ll want to disable both., This link is just below the text “Adobe Flash Player.” Once you click the link, the Adobe Flash Player entry will turn gray. This means that the player is now disabled.
 Navigate to https://www.youtube.com and click any video (or navigate to one you want to see) to test full screen mode.
 This should put the video into full screen mode. If your video now takes up the entire screen, the method worked! If not, try another method.

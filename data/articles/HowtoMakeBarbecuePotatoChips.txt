 Peel the skin off completely and use a vegetable peeler to slice the potato in thin slices. Slice the potato from one point to the other, holding it vertically. Avoid cutting the slices in half, as this will result in having them look round on one side and straight on the other.;
, Allow the slices to keep cold on the side for at least 30 minutes.
 In a small bowl, combine all of the seasonings and spices.
 Be sure to thoroughly pat dry the slices prior to cooking to lessen the risk of oil splattering.


Add vegetable oil to a large deep skillet to about 1/2 full. For best results, make sure the oil is at least 375ºF/190ºC.
Fry the slices in small batches for more control and overcrowding the skillet. Turn each piece over when golden brown in color.
 Sprinkle the barbecue seasoning on both sides of the chips while they are still hot.

, You could mention somewhere along the lines of "What do you think about the upcoming dance?" or "Have you asked anyone to the dance yet?"


If the person appears uncomfortable at the mention of the dance, you have the choice of either stopping or continuing on with this. Remember that the situation could go either way.
If the person has already asked someone out to the dance, don't feel disappointed. Be cool about it and say, "Oh, well that's nice. I hope you two have a fun time!" From there, you have the choice of either pursuing someone else or not going to the dance at all.

If you choose to pursue someone else, beware that you might hurt the first person's feelings, and you could bring down your reputation. Your intentions could be misunderstood and people may believe you were only pretending to be the person's friend so you could use him/her, even if you really weren't.

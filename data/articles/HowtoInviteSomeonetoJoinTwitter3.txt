 It's a blue app with a white bird icon on it.

You can only use 3D touch on an iPhone 6S and up.
 Doing so hard enough will prompt your iPhone's 3D Touch feature to kick in, which will display a "Share" option above or below Twitter's icon.

If the "Share" option doesn't pop up, you may first need to enable 3D Touch.
 It's the top option in the 3D Touch pop-out menu. Doing so will bring up a list of sharing options; some common options include the following:


Message - Send an iMessage or text message inviting your friend to download the Twitter app.

Mail - Send your download invitation via email.

Social Media - Any social media accounts (e.g., Facebook) that you have downloaded will appear here.
 This will create a new message or post with a link inviting people to download Twitter for their respective mobile devices.

For example, tapping Message will create a new iMessage with the link in the "Message" field, whereas tapping Facebook will create a new Timeline post with your link presented as attached media.
 For a message or email, for example, you would need to add a recipient to the "To" field near the top of the screen.

For a social media post, you might type in an accompanying message or share your Twitter username.
 Do so by tapping your sharing option's "Post" or "Send" button. Anyone who taps on the link will be directed to their device's app store, from which they can download Twitter.

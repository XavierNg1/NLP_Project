 Cats love to climb, and creating more vertical space for your cat to enjoy will help it maintain personal space. You can buy a simple cat tree with a perch. Or you can build one yourself using wooden boxes, wooden, tubes, or the drawers of an old dresser., Another way to make more vertical, personal space for your cat is by hanging some cat shelves on the wall. You can buy shelves made especially for cats, or you can hang a sturdy standard shelf for your cat. Just make sure the shelf is made to support the weight of your cat., Many cats are happiest when they are high above their humans, relaxing on a tall bookcase or the top of the refrigerator. Encourage your cat to climb on tall furniture, allowing it to gain some perspective and personal space.Try placing a cat bed on top of a bookcase or refrigerator.
 Creating paths between your catâ€™s vertical hang out spots will give your cat an increased sense of personal space and allow them to travel quickly between spaces. For example, try hanging a series of cat shelves on the wall beside a bookcase.

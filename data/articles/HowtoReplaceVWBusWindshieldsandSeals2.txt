 Those rubber seals, especially if they are old and cracked, can trap water against the metal frame which leads to rust.


If the frame is seriously rusted, it is time for a trip to the body shop to get a new one cut in.
If there is light pitting, a sanding, filling, priming and painting is in order.
Make sure the surface, even if undamaged, is clean and smooth so the new rubber will seal well.
, This is trickier than it sounds because the new rubber is a tight fit. Find a large flat work area and put down either a rubber mat or thick cloth to keep from scratching the glass while you are working.


Starting at one corner, begin sliding the glass into the inner groove of the seal (they make special tools to facilitate this, but a blunt screwdriver will work well if you are careful).
A second person here is helpful to hold the seal on the glass while you work.
 Remember, don't over torque the glass putting the seal in place. Doing so is a good way to end up buying more glass.


Work slowly and make sure the rubber is well seated on the glass.
Lubricating the glass with a little water mixed with dishwashing soap can make the rubber slide onto the glass more easily.
 Get some nylon rope a little thinner than a pencil and long enough to go all the way around the window with enough left over to hold on to - about 6 inches (15.2Â cm) to a foot on either side.


Again, soapy water can help here: Starting at the bottom of the window and leaving some excess rope hanging out, begin inserting the rope into the groove in the rubber seal that will seat into the window frame on the bus.
Run the rope all the way around the window seal in the groove and leave the excess dangling from the bottom. Keep the whole mess in line with some electricians tape. It is less adhesive than duct tape and will be easier to remove when all is in position.

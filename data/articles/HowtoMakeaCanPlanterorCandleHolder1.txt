 The use will dictate how large or small of a can you will need to use. For small votive candles, a little tuna can will do the trick. However for a substantial planter, a large can of crushed tomatoes might be more appropriate.


Have supplies such as dirt, plants, candles, glass holders, etc. on hand before you begin the project.;
, Ideally an empty tuna can works well, however small soup or other stouter cans will do the trick.


Remove the food and then wash and rinse well. Make sure you use hot, soapy water when cleaning out the can and then dry thoroughly. You want the can to be completely dry so you avoid having it rust.






Remove the can label. Depending on the label you can either wash, peel or rub it away.
 You will be encircling the can with the clothes pins, as they will become the outside of your decorative planter or candle holder. You’ll need several so don’t skimp on this purchase.

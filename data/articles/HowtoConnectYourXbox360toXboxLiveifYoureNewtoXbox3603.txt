 If you signed up for Gold with a credit card, you will be automatically renewed and the fee will be charged to your card. To use a prepaid code, Press the Guide button and select Settings. Select Account, and then Account Management. Choose your Gold account, and click “Redeem code”. Enter the code on your prepaid card, and the time will be credited to your account.
 Visit the LIVE Account page on your computer. You will need to sign in with your Microsoft ID. Select the Xbox LIVE section. In the center of the screen, click the Cancel Auto Payment link.


If you signed up with a two-year plan that included the Xbox 360 console, canceling the auto payment will terminate the contract and you will have to pay an early-termination fee.

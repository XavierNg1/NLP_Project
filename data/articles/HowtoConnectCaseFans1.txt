 Some computer towers will provide extra space on the rear panel of the case designed specifically to accommodate additional case fans. If the case fan to be installed will fit in the space provided on the vented, back panel of the case, it can be attached using 4 to 6 1/8 inch (4.76 mm) screws and a Phillips-head screwdriver.


Attach the case fan to the vented, rear panel. Power down the computer and turn the power switch off on the power supply, which is typically situated on the back of the computer tower near the AC power cord. Position the fan over the vented area. Line the screw holes in the fan up with the venting holes on the back of the case. Using a screwdriver, insert at least 4 screws into the corresponding holes in each corner of the case fan.
Connect the fan to the power supply. Locate any empty, 4-plug power connector coming from the power supply and plug the fan into the connector. Replace the side panel door on the computer case, and turn on the power switch. The additional fan has been connected.;

 Personal service requires you to know the more about the location and habits of the person you're serving than the others. Since most people don't like to be sued, they will delay dealing with a potential lawsuit as long as possible, and will go to great lengths to avoid service. It will save you time and money if you can tell your third-party service agent where the target of the lawsuit might be and when they might be there., The server must give a copy of your court papers to the respondent in person. He or she must walk up to the respondent, state, "These are court papers," and hand the respondent copies of all the papers related to your case.The respondent may refuse to accept the papers. If this happens, the server should leave the papers near the respondent and walk away. Doing so will satisfy the requirements, even if the respondent continues to refuse the papers or throws them away.
Personal service is the preferred method of service and should always be attempted before other methods are used.
 After passing the court papers to the respondent, the server should fill out the necessary form and sign it in front of a notary public. This form should then be filed with the rest of your court documents at the courthouse.

 Not doing so could result in transmission of H5N1, or bird flu, as well as spreading germs or bacteria to the baby bird. Of course, if the bird is in dire danger, pick up the bird with a towel or with a light touch and then wash your hands thoroughly after.
 Use a paper towel or rag to lightly grab the bird and move it. Just make sure to be gentle and to make contact as quick as possible.
 Because a nestling is not supposed to be out of a nest, it's important to get it back into that warm, safe place. Look around the area you found the bird before picking it up. Look for bird parents or other babies to get an idea of where the nest might be.


If you can't find the nestlings nest, make it a new one.Get a small basket or box, fill it with soft bedding, such as paper towels, and place it, with the nestling in it, near where you found the bird, except above the ground for safety. You want the parents to easily find the bird but predators not to.
Birds have a very limited sense of smell, so a parent bird will most likely continue to feed a baby bird even if you pick it up and your smell get on it a little bit.

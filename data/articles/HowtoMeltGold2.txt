 These are small, high-powered kilns that are specifically designed to melt precious metals, including gold and silver. You can buy them online.


Some of these electric gold furnaces are pretty affordable. They also allow people to mix previous metals together (such as gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and so on) and melt them at home. To use them, you will need the same equipment, including a crucible and flux.
If the gold item also contains small percentages of silver, copper or zinc, the melting point will be lower., You want to use a microwave that does not have the magnetron on the top but rather has it on the side or back.You can buy a microwave gold smelting kit or kiln. You place the kiln on a kiln shelf in the microwave. The crucible holds the gold while it is being heated and is placed in the kiln, with a lid on top.Donâ€™t use the microwave for cooking food again if you have used it to melt gold, though.

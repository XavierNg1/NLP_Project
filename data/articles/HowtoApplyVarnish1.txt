 This will remove any imperfections and blemishes before applying the varnish. Use 100 grit sandpaper for unfinished pieces, and work with the grain of the wood. Sand gently until the piece is smooth.








If your piece is stained, use 240 or 280 grit sandpaper.;
, Varnish is beautiful, durable finish, but it is prone to attracting dust, hair, and other impurities before it dries. Plan to varnish your piece in a place that is clean and will not be disturbed.








Try to apply the varnish in a different location than the one you sanded your piece in.
If you have to use the same location, vacuum (don’t sweep) thoroughly after sanding.
Wet mopping the floor before you begin can also help keep dust down.
 You’ll only need a few basic supplies to varnish wood. All of them are readily available at your local hardware store. Make sure to get:Varnish (read the label carefully to make sure it is true oil-based varnish, not polyurethane)
A paintbrush (natural bristle is preferable)
A stirring stick
A large, clear measuring cup with markings on the side
Paint thinner (turpentine or mineral spirits)
Rubber gloves and a respirator (optional)

, Avoid shaking the container of varnish. Open it carefully, and use your stick to stir the varnish thoroughly. Work slowly and gently -- you don’t want to introduce air bubbles into the varnish.
 Pour enough varnish for the first coat into your measuring cup. The exact amount will vary depending on how large your piece is, but generally it pays to start small - you can always add more. Then, add some paint thinner directly to the varnish and stir carefully.








Experts suggest using 20-25 percent thinner for the first coat of varnish, and 5-10 percent for subsequent coats.
For instance, if you pour three quarters of a cup of varnish for your first coat, add one quarter cup of thinner. For subsequent cups, you can pour 9 ounces of varnish and 1 ounce of thinner.

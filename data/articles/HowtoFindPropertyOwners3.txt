 If you see signs in nearby yards for a particular real estate agent, give them a call and ask about the property. An agent selling other houses or property in the area is likely to have knowledge about the neighborhood.


In addition to knowledge about the neighborhood including general demographics and property value trends, a real estate agent has contact with title search companies and other professional resources.
A real estate agent's professional connections can enable her to find information about a property owner much faster than you could on your own.
 Since title companies routinely perform searches to clear title on properties, and record deeds after title transfers, they have easy access to accurate, current information on a property.


If you want to buy the property, connecting with a title search company will be essential, because you will need a complete and accurate history of the property's title and its value.A title company isn't going to conduct a title search for free. Title search fees, which typically run between $200 and $400, normally would be included in the general closing costs when you were buying a house.A title search independent of a home sale might cost more, depending on the company you contact.
 Skip tracers, like bounty hunters, are professionals who find people who've "skipped" out and can't be located by usual means. Skip tracers are familiar with and have access to a number of databases that may not be available to the general public.Skip tracers also may interview neighbors, relatives, or other sources and conduct surveillance on the property if necessary to locate the owner.
Independent skip tracers often work with bounty hunters, bail bondsmen, and private investigators.

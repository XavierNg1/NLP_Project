 Contact a local police department that you would like to work at. Ask them if they are accepting entry-level police officer applications. Also, ask them about their basic qualifications. For example, while the basic qualifications to become a police officer in California is to be 18 years of age, other departments require a higher age limit, like 20 years of age at the time of your examinations.
 If you are qualified and they are accepting entry-level police officers, complete an application at a prospective department. Go to the department's website to download the application, and complete it at home. If the department does not have a website, go to the department directly. Ask them about the essential information needed to fill out the application.


Be prepared to provide information like a certified copy of a birth certificate or naturalization, copies of high school and college degrees, transcripts, marriage certificate, copy of vehicle and medical insurance policies, copies of divorce decrees (if applicable), and other materials., A background check is a necessary part of the screening process. The department will contact previous employers, supervisors, coworkers, family members, college advisors, and roommates. Create a list of your references and contact them. Tell them that you are in the application process to become a police officer, and that they will be contacted for reference verification.

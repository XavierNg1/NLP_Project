 For this version of the trick, you’ll need clear plastic tape, a balloon, and a kabob skewer. You’ll need enough tape to make 4 small-sized pieces. All of these items should be easily obtained at your local grocery store.


Any type of tape will work for this, it just needs to be able to strongly adhere to the balloon. Clear tape works best.
 An overfilled balloon is more likely to pop, so if you overfill it, simply let some air out. Skewering the balloon is easiest when it is a little flat. Longer balloons for balloon animals don’t work as well as normal round balloons., When attempting this trick for the first time, you might want to place the tape cross at the bottom of the balloon. As you get more experience, try placing the tape cross on the side of the balloon where it is stretched more.The bottom of the balloon is less likely to pop because the rubber is not stretched as tightly.
 Again, if trying this for the first time, you will want to place the second cross at the top of the balloon directly across from the first tape cross at the bottom of the balloon.


After you tried the top and bottom, try the sides of the balloon. Just make sure the tape crosses are directly opposite each other.
 Applying gentle pressure, carefully push the skewer through one of the taped crosses. It does not matter which cross you go through first. The skewer should easily pass through the rubber of the balloon without popping.If the balloon pops, try again. Make sure the tape is firmly pressed onto the side of the balloon.
 After you have penetrated one side of the balloon, push the skewer through to the other cross. Position the skewer so that it pokes through the center of the cross. Apply enough pressure for it to go all the way through. The skewer should go through without popping the balloon.If you want to make it really fancy, push several skewers through by adding more tape crosses.

 If your Vans are really dirty and you want to start getting them clean, take your shoes outside. Hold them over an area onto which you can shake dirt.









If your shoes are muddy, let them dry thoroughly before brushing them off. It'll be easier that way.
Use a soft shoe brush or toothbrush to brush away caked on dirt. Hit the soles of the shoes together to knock away any small particles of dust and dirt.
 Fill a bucket halfway full with warm water and one or two tbsp. (15 to 30ml) of mild dish detergent. Swish it around in your bucket, until suds start to rise.
 Taking the shoe in one hand, work the brush back and forth on the surface of the shoes with the other.









If the shoes are quite dirty, you can dip the surface lightly in the water, brushing hard to clean the bottom of the shoe.
 After you've scrubbed the shoes thoroughly, give them a quick rinse with fresh warm water, inside, or from another bucket.
 Lay the wet shoes on a clean white towel and wrap the towel around each shoe. Press the excess water out of the canvas with the towel. Repeat with the other shoe.









Place the shoes open outside to air dry. If the shoes are white, place them in direct sunlight to bleach them slightly.
Stuff them with hand towels or plain white paper towels to absorb water. This helps to avoid shrinkage and those dark lines in the places where the Vans bend when you're walking.

 If you are planning to stargaze in a busy city parking lot, you arenâ€™t likely to see much with any telescope. Light pollution will disrupt the image and make it difficult for you to focus on any celestial objects. Find a place away from street lights, and busy roadways to do your stargazing., Not all planets, stars, comets, or other celestial objects can be seen at all times of the year. Make a list of the celestial bodies that are visible in your location when you go stargazing. Also, make a note of where those bodies are in relation to one another. This will make it easier for you to find them.Some telescopes come with software that will locate specific bodies, but they can be difficult to set up and orient properly.
 If you are a beginner, you should consider keeping your telescope design simple. Putting together a complicated instrument in the dark deters many people from using their telescopes. Alternatively, you could go out before sunset and set your telescope up, then wait for night time.

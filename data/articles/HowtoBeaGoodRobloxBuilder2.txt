 Try the library. Search the plugins section for building tools.

Building Tools by F3X: This is a building tool for a more advanced building, to make details and things you can't do using the basic tools.
GapFill: This plugin "fills in" a variety of gaps. Useful for gaps that are shaped in a complex way.
Oozledraw Toolbar- Draw Curve/Rope: This makes curves using geometry to find the gravity pull, the kind, and the form. This is useful to make rope or to add detail into something.
Cutscene Editor- You can make sort of "tours" of the place with this. It works by knowing to go from one point to another, and where it's facing when traveling.
 Click the Favorite button, or "Take One" if available.
 You must launch a fresh copy of Roblox Studio, you cannot use a Studio window that has a build already open.
 There will be a little address bar at the top, near the tabs you usually use to switch between script editing and Place editing. In this browser, type www.roblox.com. Log in there if you're not using Internet Explorer.
 There should be a new Plugins category due to you favoriting a plugin. If you have any builds open in Studio, save them at this point.
 The previously dark 'install' button should now be green. Click it and confirm. Roblox Studio should now restart and install the plugin you asked for.
 Click it to turn it on, then either open a place or create a new one with the options given.

 This herb is yet another much loved plant for rolling in. It can also be used dried in cat toys. If planting it, grow where there is plenty of space for lying on it and rolling around, under and in it.
 Most members of the mint family entice cats. A little nibble here and there won't be a bother if you're sharing the mint for your own culinary needs.
 Cats enjoy playing with the foliage and flowers.
 Honeysuckle wood is a cat attractant.It is safest to put the wood inside a sachet or fabric mouse, etc. so that your cat cannot choke on the wood; or, give a thick branch rather than a stem that can split easily.


Honeysuckle flowers can upset the cat's digestive system. Hence, don't encourage gorging on the flowers. One flower for play might be okay but no more. If you think it will be a problem, don't encourage it.
Honeysuckle berries are poisonous. Another reason not to encourage close engagement with the plant.
 Sometimes cats that aren't thrilled by catnip enjoy this plant instead. It will release its odor when bruised.

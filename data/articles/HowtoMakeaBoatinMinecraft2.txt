 Find a calm spot on the water, select your Boat from you inventory, and then right-click on the water. Your boat will be placed. If it is placed on a current, it will start to follow the current.


A boat can also be placed on land by right clicking. It can be controlled on land but its movement will be extremely slow. They also sink into ground so you may need to get out by destroying a block beside it.
The boat can be placed on lava, but it will break when you try to enter it.
 Right-click on the boat to enter it. You can do so from any direction, including beneath it after diving. Press the left Shift key to exit the boat.
 The boat will go in any direction you are pointing your cursor when you hold the W button. Pressing the Back S key will quickly turn the boat around in the opposite direction.Boats are extremely fragile, and can break easily in a crash.To prevent them from crashing, slow down before you get near an island. If a boat does get destroyed in a crash, it will drop three Wood Planks and two Sticks. If the boat is destroyed by an attack, (skeleton shoots it) it will drop a Boat.
You can Sprint while using the boat to move slightly faster.

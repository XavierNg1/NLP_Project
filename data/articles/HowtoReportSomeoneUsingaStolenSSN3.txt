 The Social Security Administration (SSA) investigates certain kinds of fraud committed using stolen Social Security Numbers. For example, you can report the following to SSA:


Someone used the stolen SSN to make a claim. It is illegal to provide false information when applying for Social Security benefits, so SSA can investigate if the person used the number to get benefits.Someone is buying or selling counterfeit cards. SSA will also investigate this crime as well.
 Often, someone will use a stolen Social Security Number in order to gain access to different government benefits programs. They use the stolen SSN because they otherwise would not qualify. You should identify what benefits, if any, the person has obtained using the stolen SSN. For example:


food stamps
housing assistance
health insurance, such as Medicare or Medicaid

, Stealing a Social Security Number is a central part of identity theft. After stealing the number, the thief can open up credit cards, take out loans, or gain access to the victim’s bank accounts.


Increasingly, identity thieves also steal identities to get prescription drugs or medical records. The person poses as you at a doctor’s office in order to receive medical treatment or to obtain prescription drugs, which they use or sell.You should report all of these crimes to law enforcement and other agencies. See Report Identity Theft for more information.

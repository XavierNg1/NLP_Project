 For a general cleaning, fill a bucket with warm water and add a squirt of liquid detergent. Add more soap to your bucket if you think you’ll have a tough time cutting through stubborn dirt and grime.Opt for non-abrasive cleaners such as dish and laundry detergents, household all-purpose cleaners, bathroom cleaners, or baking soda.
Avoid abrasive cleaning products, such as scouring powders, since these can damage to your fiberglass bathtub or shower.;
, Dunk a soft sponge in your bucket of warm soapy water and gently scrub the surface of your fiberglass shower or tub. If you don’t use a soft sponge, make sure that your applicator is made of nylon, polyester, or polyurethane.Do not use scouring pads, steel wool, or scrapers because they will be too harsh on the fiberglass.
 Let the cleaning solution sit on your fiberglass surfaces for about an hour. Afterward, rinse the tub or shower thoroughly with warm, clean water and dry it with a hand towel.

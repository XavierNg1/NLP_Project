 Erase the top half. Curve the sides out and put a straight line at the top of the curves. Round the edges. This will be the head, so make it large.;
, Draw two rounded intersecting lines as the top wrinkles. Erase the tops so they don't touch. There should now be two curves facing the top. Do two more curvy lines, facing the opposite direction. You should have a wavy diamond-like shape, but with no lines touching.
 Put two more curvy lines next to the diamond bottom, above the curves you just drew but a little shorter. None of the curves should touch the sides of the head.
 Do two curvy lines (don't worry, these are your last ones!) They should look like two candy canes facing opposite each other, curving up just a little bit. Erase 3/4 of the curve. There should be a space in between. Put a short line halfway in between.
 They should look like the top 1/4 of your shoes. Put some circles in between. Put a circle inside the circle, taking up most of the space, and a circle inside the circle you just drew. Broaden the mustache lines on the right side of the shoe-shape.
 Round the edges. Draw an upside down rainbow directly under the rounded mustache and then a curve sticking out. Draw a line where the curve cuts in half. Erase 1/2 of it.

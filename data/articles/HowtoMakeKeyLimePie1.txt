, Roll them into crumbs, using a rolling pin. You should have about 1 1/2 cups of crumbs when finished.


If you don't have a rolling pin, get creative. A can of cooking spray or a bottle of wine (or heck, a shoe) gets the job done. So does the food processor, for the record.
 Don't scorch it! You need all of it to keep your crust together.
 Blend until the texture resembles coarse meal. It should be one uniform consistency after a minute or so of mixing.


If you'd like, add the nutmeg, cinnamon, or allspice at this step. Just a generous sprinkling or two will do!

, Voila! Your homemade graham cracker pie crust. But as you probably know, you could just also buy a pre-made one from the store -- but where's the fun in that?


Try to make the crust about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) evenly all around. If the crumb mixture won't stick properly, adding a tablespoon of water to the mix will help. Make sure there are no gaps or holes in the crust!

, Then remove the crust from the oven and refrigerate until well chilled. You need the time to prepare the filling anyway.

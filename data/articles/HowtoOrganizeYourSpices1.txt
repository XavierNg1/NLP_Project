 Look at your spices tot get a sense of not just what you have, but how much of each spice you have. With this information in hand, you can begin thinking about which organizational method is best for you and your spices., There’s no need to have three containers of cumin or two containers of ginger. Combine spices of the same type whenever possible to save space. If you have two spices of the same type that are both relatively full, combine them in a larger container if possible., If you have spices that are prepackaged but opened and you don’t plan on using them, give them to friends who are interested. If you have spices that are prepackaged but unopened, give them to friends or donate them to your local food bank. If you have spices that are expired, throw them out., If you have empty bottles – for instance, from a spice rack – that you want to keep and refill with fresher spices, wash them thoroughly and let them dry before refilling. If you have prepackaged spices that you won’t be refilling, just use a damp cloth and carefully scrub the outside of the bottle as needed., If you buy unlabeled spices from wholesalers, ethnic grocers, or some other venue, you’ll need to label them. This will help you keep track of what you have and how old each spice is.The most low-cost way to label your spices is to just slap some masking tape on the resealable container you store them in. Write the name of the spice and the date you obtained it on the tape using marker or pen.
Remove the tape when the spice is expired or when decide to use that container to store a different spice.

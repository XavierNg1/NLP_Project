, If you notice your cat has eye inflammation, your first step should be to take the cat to the vet. The vet will be able to narrow down the cause and help you decide on a treatment., While examining your cat, the vet will need to perform an eye examination. Often, that will include a dye test, where the vet puts a dye in your cat's eye. Then the vet can better see into the eye, making it easier to diagnose the problem., Blood tests may be needed to help diagnose any underlying conditions. While a cause cannot always be found, a blood test can at least help narrow down the possibilities. Your cat may need other tests as well, such as a urine test.

Iron Cross may be played with blinds or all-ante - whatever suits your game
Iron Cross should be played pot-limit or possibly structured limit. As there are five betting rounds, the first two rounds in limit should be the lower frame, while the final three rounds at the upper frame (it is also acceptable for the final round of betting to be at 3x or 4x the initial frame).;

Dealer note: The community cards will be arranged in a "+" (cross) pattern. This first card is placed as the left point of the cross, the second should be placed as the top card, the third as right, fourth as bottom and finally the river card is placed in the center of the cross. Be sure to leave room for the community cards!
Player note: Players will select either the horizontal or vertical three community cards at showdown to make his or her best five card hand of the chosen community and five hole cards.
, As in the dealer note above, the remaining three cards will be dealt as the opposite points of the cross with the final card in the center among the other four.


Rounds two through five of betting commence with the player to the left of the dealer.
,


The last player to place an unraised fifth-round bet must show down first, then each player to his left may fold or showdown in succession.
In the event of a fifth round checkdown (all remaining players check), the player closest to the dealer's left is the first to showdown.

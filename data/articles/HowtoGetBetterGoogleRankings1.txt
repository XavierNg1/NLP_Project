 The crucial way to better your Google ranking is to use informational keywords, which start with “where,” “how,” and “when,” and which are relatively different when compared to commercial and transactional. For example, instead of using “YouTube tutorial of a paper tree,” you can replace it with “How to make a paper tree by watching a tutorial on YouTube.” These keywords help improve the search rankings by providing detailed content when the users use the keyword in their Google search statements.;
, Back up your article with relevant data and data-driven facts. The more statistical and informative data you use, the better your Google rank will be. To emphasize the content, you can focus on the micro content, which is not revealed on all the other websites of your field.
 Stories can captivate your audience, evoke emotions, improve your conversion rate and add numbers to it. Instead of planting the data in a simplistic and plain form, you can modify it into a conventional storytelling-kind of article to create interest among the readers.
 An article with a curious headline is visually more tempting than the one without. A curious headline is the one that your target market might have a slight knowledge about and want to know more about it. The best example of this is the ad created in 1926 for selling pianos, which read, “They laughed when I sat down at the piano—but when I started to play!” It captured attention—what happened when he started to play? So make sure that your articles inspire curiosity among the audience.
 Aside from arising curiosity, make sure that you deliver the content based on the promise of your headline. Often, you find blogs with assuring headlines and zero content—don’t be one of them. This will most likely hurt your business rather than help.

 These all-in-one t-shirts are placed over the infant’s head and close with snaps at the bottom. They easily unsnap, allowing for easy diaper changes.
 These one piece garments are practical and usually very affordable. They come in a variety of cute designs and make diaper changes very easy.
 Even on warmer days, baby’s tiny feet can become cold because an infant does not yet have good circulation.


On days when your baby is not wearing a one piece outfit that cover the feet, a pair of socks may be all that is needed to keep his feet warm rather than using a blanket.
Newborn caps are lightweight and will keep baby’s head warm on cooler days without causing him to overheat.

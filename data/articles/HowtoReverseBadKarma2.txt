 If you have identified the actions that have led you to bad karma, realize it is time for you to change your actions.


If you find yourself being negative toward a specific person or people, resolve to start a conversation with a compliment next time. Develop this as a new positive habit.
If you find yourself being selfish, resolve to do a charitable action each day even if it is a small one. Try something small like holding a door open for someone. Practice this to develop a new routine of positive actions.
 Life is difficult and frustrating events happen. Thinking positive may not reverse bad events, but it can help you better cope with stress in your life. Try and reflect on the positive things in life to help you reverse bad karma by seeing the good and kindness in life.


Take a moment to enjoy the weather. If the weather is nice, reflect that not everyday will be like this.
Give thanks to your good health.
Enjoy a meal. Sometimes we eat without thinking; take a few moments to savor a well-prepared dish.
 As “karma” means action, you must be accountable for the actions that you take. Try to:


Stop blaming others. This is a bad habit. Really consider the action and try and move on from it. Blaming others only slows down this process.
Practice self-focusing. Worrying about the future will not help you in the present. Focus on the daily tasks that you can control to live a more positive life.
Be accountable. You are the only one responsible for your actions. If, for example, you are in an argument with a loved one, you can control how you respond. Focus on how you respond.

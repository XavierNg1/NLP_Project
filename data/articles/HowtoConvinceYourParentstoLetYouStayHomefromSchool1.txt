 Don't assume you will always get your way. If you want to stay home from school, whatever the reason may be, ask your parents if it's okay.

Unless you have a good reason to stay home, your parents may not want you to skip.;

It will only prove to them that you are not mature enough to stay home by yourself.If you feel yourself getting angry, take a deep breath. If you have time, you could try asking them again later in the day.Don't call your parents names, or be mean to them. They may have great reasons for wanting you to go to school. If you start yelling at them, you'll just get yourself in trouble., Try working out a compromise with your parents.

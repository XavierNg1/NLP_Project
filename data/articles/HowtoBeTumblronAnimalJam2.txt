 Try matching your den with your look. For example; your look is autumn them, make your den autumn themed.

If necessary, go onto Google Images and search Tumblr room or look at Tumblr blogs for room decor.


Tumblr rooms usually have plants (like roses, cacti, etc.), coffee, windows, fairy lights, pictures on the walls and a big comfy bed with lots of pillows.
Some rooms are black and some are white. Choose your desired wallpaper or leave it plain.
 Don't just get all your items from one shop. You will have to look around if you want the best items.

The den item shop has many good items and you could change the colors of some of them.
If you want Tumblr plants, go to Sarepia Forest. You could buy succulents, cacti, roses, etc.
You could even make Tumblr paintings. However, it costs 2 diamonds to get a frame and put it in your den.
 Betas are difficult to get but with trading, you will eventually get them.

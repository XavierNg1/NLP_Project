 Obstacles usually require irregular or curved cuts to be made. The jigsaw is the ideal cutting tool for this. Use a jigsaw with a standard blade or, if you’re cutting flooring, use one with a laminate flooring jigsaw blade with fine teeth.


The fine teeth will reduce the likelihood of chipping the laminate., Making a template will help you get the curved cut just right and prevent wasted laminate. Hold a piece of paper up against your obstacle and trace around the object. Cut the shape out of the paper. Put the paper template back down next to the obstacle to confirm the accuracy of the shape.


You may need to make several attempts before you get the template exactly right.
Instead of creating a paper template, you can also use a forge profile gauge. Push the gauge up against the obstacle to get the shape, then transfer that shape onto the laminate by tracing it with your marker., Use the jigsaw to carefully cut along the marked line. Hold the jigsaw vertically, which will help the blade make a smooth cut from one side of the laminate to the other.


After you make the cut, hold the laminate up to the obstacle to confirm it will fit around it exactly right.
Use a damp cloth to wipe off any remaining ink from the laminate’s surface.

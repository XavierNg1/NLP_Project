 To ensure that the oven is hot enough to roast the chicken, it’s important to preheat the oven. Set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat. Make sure that the oven rack is in the center position too.Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it’s fully preheated. It will probably beep or flash an indicator light when it’s ready.;
, Take 3 ½ pounds (1.6 kg) of bone-in chicken breasts and whole chicken legs, and coat both sides of the chicken pieces with approximately 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil. Apply a generous amount of salt and pepper to both sides for seasoning as well.If you don’t have any olive oil on hand, you can substitute vegetable or canola oil. The taste will be slightly different, but you shouldn’t notice any other differences.
 Once the chicken is coated with oil and seasoned, set the pieces on a baking sheet. Roast it in the oven for approximately 45 to 50 minutes or until its internal temperature reaches 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius).Have an instant-read thermometer on hand so you can quickly and easily determine the chicken’s internal temperature. Make sure to test each piece because they can cook differently depending on their size and thickness.
 When the chicken has finished roasting, remove it from the pan. Transfer it to a cutting board, and let the pieces to cool enough for handling. That typically takes approximately 20 minutes.

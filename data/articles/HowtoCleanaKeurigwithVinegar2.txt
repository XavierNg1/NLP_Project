 Plug your Keurig in and verify that the power is on. Turn off the Auto Off function as well to prevent your machine from shutting down mid-cleaning., Add a 50-50 vinegar and distilled water mixture into the reservoir. Continue until you reach the maximum filling line. Do not add a K-cup after this stage, it is not needed as your machine will brew directly from the reservoir. You will see the water light turn on indicating that your machine is ready to brew.It is important to use just distilled water, as this will prevent any additional hard water deposits from forming during the cleaning process.If your Keurig refuses to run without a pod in place, go ahead and put an empty one in the holder. This will not impact the cleaning process., Before you start the brew cycle, set a ceramic coffee mug in the middle of the drip tray. Then, select the most substantial brew cycle and proceed. The liquid will drain into the mug and will be quite hot, so watch your hands., Continue to drain out your mug and keep the brew cycle going until the reservoir indicates that more water is needed. At this point, you can add more of the vinegar mixture or you can let the machine sit for a few hours before performing a final drain and rinse., Dump any remaining vinegar solution in the reservoir in the sink. Fill up the reservoir with fresh, distilled water. Run another cycle, using the mug once more to catch the run off. This will also help to dispel some of the vinegar odor from your machine.If you are not sure if your Keurig is truly free of vinegar, then add a pinch of backing soda into your final coffee mug of water. If there is a fizzy reaction, then perform another water brew., If you descale on this schedule, then you will prevent the accumulation of hard water deposits and bacteria. This will make your machine last longer and your coffee may even taste better. Set an alarm on your phone or make a note on a paper calendar to alert you when another descaling is scheduled.

 The quickest way to order decimals is to look at their whole numbers. If one whole number is greater than or less than the others, you know the decimal is greater than or less than the others.

For example, if you are comparing 14.36, and 13.458, and 14.369, you would compare 14, 13, and 14. Since 13 is less than 14, you know that 13.458 is the smallest number. 


, Moving from left-to-right, compare the digits in each place value. Noting where the numbers differ will help you set up your number line.

For example, 14.36 and 14.369 have the same digits until the thousandths place.
 These will be the first and last numbers you label on your number line. To find these numbers, look to the last place value where the numbers shared the same digit. This will be the first number on your number line. To find the last number, add 1 to the last place value the numbers shared.

For example, since the last place value where 14.36 and 14.369 share a digit is the hundredths place, the first number on the number line will be 14.36. Determine the last number by adding 1 to the hundredths place. So, the last number on the number line is 14.37.
 Since each new place value increases or decreases by a factor of 10, you should divide the line into tenths to represent the 10 smaller numbers that come between the first and last numbers on the number line.You do not need to label each number, but doing so can make it easier to plot the numbers you are comparing.

For example, between 14.36 and 14.37, you should label 14.361, 14.362, 14.363, 14.364, 14.365, 14.366, 14.367, 14.368, and 14.369. 


, If you labeled all the numbers on your number line, simply find the corresponding number and draw a dot. If you did not label, you will need to count the hash marks. If a number you are comparing does not fall directly on a labeled point of the number line, plot the number between two other numbers or hash marks.For example, if you are comparing 14.36 and 14.369, draw a dot on the first number of the number line to show 14.36. Draw a dot on the second-to-last number to show 14.369.
 On a number line, numbers grow larger left-to-right. So, the greatest number will be the farthest right on the number line, and the least number will be the farthest left on the number line.For example, since 14.369 is to the right of 14.36, then 14.369 is the larger number.
 The smallest number should be listed first, and the largest number should be listed last. The other numbers should be listed between these two, in ascending order.

For example, 13.458, 14.36, 14,369. You can also use the less than sign to show their relationship: 13.458 < 14.36 < 14,369.

 When you are cleaning your cleaning products, you want to make sure you use the best disinfectant for the types of cleaning jobs you do. If you are cleaning supplies that are used in high germ areas such as the bathroom or the kitchen, you should use a product with germ fighting capabilities. If you are cleaning supplies that are used for dusting or other gentle jobs, you should use less harsh cleaning products such as soap or natural cleansers.


If your cleaning supplies are colored, avoid using bleach. Your supplies will lose the vibrant colors in them when they come into contact with the bleach.
If you are trying to get our smells from cleaning supplies, look into deodorizing disinfectants or cleaning solutions.
 Each type of cleaning product you use will have a different schedule for cleaning, which will also vary depending on how often you use the supplies. Larger appliances such as vacuums may not need to be cleaned as often, only going through deep cleaning two or three times a year. Sponges should be cleaned once a week and towels, brushes, and cloths should typically be cleaned after ever use.


Dusters may only need a gently shake after every use, with a deep clean being done every four to six uses. Brooms may only need to be cleaned every month or so.Most cleaning supplies should be cleaned if they are used in a deep cleaning process to clear away the grim accumulated.
 Your cleaning supplies should be replaced every so often, even when you keep them clean. Brooms and brushes should be replaced every six months or so.Sponges and sponge mop heads should be replaced every month.Some cleaning supplies, such as microfiber cloths, towels, and dusters, should only be replaced when they have worn out.
Vacuum bags should be replaced whenever they are full. Things such as vacuum filters need to be replaced less often, such as every one to three years, depending of frequency of use.

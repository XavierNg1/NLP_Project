 Often the situations and experiences that disrupt a trust relationship are motivated by rash or emotional decisions.Trying to act rationally and control your feelings may help you become more trustworthy. If you do not feel like you can control your emotions on your own, consider meeting with a therapist to discuss strategies for coping., If you know what your parents don’t want you to do, it is easier to avoid doing it. If you are unsure about their exact rules or expectations, ask them. If your violation of trust is recent, you should be extra vigilant about any activities that may be considered off-limits.
 You live with your parents for a limited amount of time. They likely have rules or expectations about what should and should not be done while you are living under their roof. Stick to those rules, even if they seem unreasonable to you.


Remember that you will eventually have your own home and you can live the way that you want to live later.
Even if it seems like an eternity before you move out of your parents’ house, the time will pass and you will be able to move on eventually.
 If there was a specific person, habit, activity, or event that broke you and your parents’ trust relationship, avoid it at all costs. If you feel that you need help avoiding it, ask for help.


In the case of something like substance abuse, you may need professional help to fight an addiction.
If there is a particular friend who leads you to make bad decisions, it may be time to move on or take a break from that friendship.

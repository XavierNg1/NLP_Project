 Turn your suit jacket over so that the backside is facing you. Position the jacket so that the bottom of the jacket is facing you., Take the left side of the suit jacket and fold it to the right so that the arm slightly overlaps the center of the suit and the lapel is facing up. Flatten out the arm so that it doesn't get wrinkled when you make additional folds later., Take the right side of the jacket and fold it to the left in the same way that you did for the other side of the suit jacket. The arms should overlap. Line both lapels so that they run parallel with one another., Fold the bottom of the jacket and line it up to the top of the suit, near the collar. Place your hand under the suit, and flip it over. It should now be folded into a nice compact square, with the lapel facing up.

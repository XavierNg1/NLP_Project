 Pierre-Elliott Trudeau International Airport, located just southwest of the city, is the largest commercial airport in the area and the main thoroughfare for air travelers. Many established airlines fly here, such as Air Canada or United, but you may find better deals on smaller low-cost airlines.;
, The latter option is usually cheaper, but far more inconvenient. A compromise to consider would be making one stop after your departure city in Toronto, just over an hour away by plane from Montreal, which can save you money without taking up your whole day in flying.
 Depending on how far away you are coming from, you can easily drive north to Montreal from Plattsburgh or Burlington International Airport in nearby New York state, if you find a better deal on airfare through these airports.

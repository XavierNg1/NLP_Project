 To ensure that the oven is hot enough to roast the ramps, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Make sure that the oven rack is in the center position before you preheat it.
 Place 10 to 15 whole ramps on a large metal baking sheet. Drizzle ¼ cup (59 ml) of olive oil and ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of sea salt over them, and toss well so the ramps are fully coated.Be sure that the ramps are rinsed and trimmed before you toss them with the olive oil and salt.
 Once the ramps are seasoned and coated with olive oil, place the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Allow the ramps to roast for 15 to 17 minutes, or until the leaves just begin to char.You don’t want the ramps to actually burn. They’ll have a burnt toast taste if they do.
 When the ramps are finished roasting, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Mix the ramps into salads and pasta dishes, or use them as a topping for steaks and burgers.Store leftover roasted ramps in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They should stay fresh for up to three days.

 In severe cases of surfer’s eye, your ophthalmologist must surgically remove the growth – pterygium – from your eye. By removing the growth, your doctor will remove abnormal cells and enable you to see correctly.


Surgery is only needed in severe circumstances, when abnormal tissue blocks sight or threatens a person’s ability to see.
The procedure usually lasts less than an hour.
Surgery to remove pterygium may cause or worsen astigmatism., In many cases, doctors will use techniques that will inhibit future abnormal tissue growth into their surgery. By using these techniques, you’ll substantially lower the chance of developing surfer’s eye in the future.


Ask about anti-metabolites. These will slow or inhibit the growth of pterygium cells that may be left over after surgery. A common anti-metabolite used to treat surfer’s eye is Mitomycin C.
Your doctor may also place a barrier – a thin membrane – over the site of surgery to inhibit the growth of abnormal tissue., An important part of providing care after your surgery is to wear an eye patch. An eye patch will protect your eye and allow it to heal properly.


You’ll likely have to wear an eye patch for one or two days after surgery.
Avoid dry or dusty environments for up to a week after surgery.
You will most likely be able to return to work or your usual activities the day after surgery.

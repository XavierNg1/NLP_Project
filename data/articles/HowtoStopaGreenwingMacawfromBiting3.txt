 If your bird clicks its beak several times in a row, you should take this as a sign that your bird is either feeling defensive, aggressive, or does not want to be handled. Often beak clicking is accompanied by raising of a foot or neck stretching. Be mindful of your bird’s behavior. Attempting to play with your bird at this time might result in a bite.


Tongue clicking, on the other hand, is a sign that your bird wants to play. Learn the difference between beak and tongue clicking and respond appropriately. , Flashing eyes are a potential signal that something is wrong. Eye pinning could mean that your bird is excited, but it often forewarns anger or aggression. When you notice your birds’ eyes flashing, look for sources of distress in the immediate environment, and do not attempt to handle your bird to avoid biting., Growling is a bird’s vocal way of telling you that they do not want to be touched. If a bird is feeling aggressive, growling is often coupled with dilated pupils and raised feathers. Retreat and give your bird some time to calm down.
 This is a sign that he wants to come out, so take advantage of it! Open the cage door, and offer your arm to him, and say "step up" or "up". Make sure you yourself aren't nervous, because your macaw can tell. Make eye contact and he'll be less likely to bite. If he lunges at your arm, tell him firmly "no" and close the door. This will teach him that he can't come out of the cage unless he steps up onto your arm.

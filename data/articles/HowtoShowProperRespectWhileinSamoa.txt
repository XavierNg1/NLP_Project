 This is a must!;
, Samoa is tropical, but it's not anything-goes. Avoid public displays of affection, and dress modestly.


Nude or topless (for women) sunbathing is discouraged or prohibited, and bikinis and other skimpy attire is frowned upon in villages. In formal situations, such as in church, it's generally preferred that women wear a lavalava (a sarong-like garment) instead of shorts or pants.
Sit down with your legs crossed when around others in a "fale samoa." If your legs get tired while you're sitting, and you need to uncross them, cover them with a mat or face them away from everyone else. Exercise care to not point your feet at others while you are seated.



Never talk to the elders while standing up. It's customary to talk to them while sitting down, and if they're sitting on a chair, squat or kneel down to talk to them. Even if you're not talking to an elder directly, you should not stand if you are in a room where an elder is seated.
Say "tulou," which means excuse me, when you pass someone older than you if they're sitting on the floor or in a chair.
 It's also proper to offer a meal to your house guests.
 Most Samoans are Christians, and most are very religious.


Respect the evening prayer curfew. The curfew usually lasts 10-20 minutes sometime between 6-7 in the evening. The blowing of a conch shell or the ringing of a bell often mark its beginning and end. Avoid traveling during the curfew, and be extra quiet.
Respect Sundays. Be aware that most stores will be closed on Sundays, so stock up on what you need. Travel slowly through villages on Sundays, and generally be quiet and respectful. Take it easy.
 Many people will be happy to let you take their picture, but be sure to ask first, and respect the wishes of those who don't wish to be photographed.

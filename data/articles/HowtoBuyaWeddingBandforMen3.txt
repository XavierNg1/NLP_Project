 Don't buy your fiancé's wedding ring several days before your marriage. A wedding band is not something you purchase on impulse. Give yourself time, and plan to purchase the ring at least a month before the big day., Before you go ring shopping, decide how much you want to spend. This will help you avoid purchasing a too-pricey wedding band. Factor embellishments, like engravings, into the final cost. Don't pressure yourself into buying more than you can afford.

The average cost of a men's wedding band is between $500-$1500.You don't have to buy an expensive wedding band to show your fiancé you love him. Heartfelt rings go a long way.
 Some wedding bands will be more high-maintenance than others. Rings with gemstones, for example, will need to be soaked regularly in warm water and brushed to keep shiny. Gemstone-free rings, especially rings made of platinum or yellow gold, will require less upkeep. Decide how much upkeep will be best for your partner.Titanium rings are especially low-maintenance.
 When you're buying a wedding band, think about long-term value. Trendy rings are great, but think about whether your fiancé will still want to wear this ring in fifty years. He might appreciate a stronger, longer-lasting ring over a fashionable one.

Chat with the jeweler and ask them which wedding bands they would recommend for long-term use. Ask them whether a certain ring is more classic or modern.

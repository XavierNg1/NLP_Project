 This will be the cap of the primary mushroom.;
, Try to make the lower part tilt slightly to the left. This will serve as the first mushroom's stem.
 Change the shape of this second mushroom. Make it smaller, with a pointy cap and a thicker, more crooked stem.
 Make this one tinier, with a rounder cap and thinner stem than the other two.
 Put vertical lines on the undersides to give your mushrooms texture, and sketch creases on the stems and small shapes all over the first and third mushrooms.
 Color the caps of the first and third mushrooms red, and the second in yellow/light beige. You can also make the stems all the same color (as seen here) so they appear to be part of a family, but that's your decision.

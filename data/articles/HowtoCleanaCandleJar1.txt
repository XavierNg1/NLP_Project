, Push the point into the wax several times in a line until the candle puck cracks. It should come out in one or two pieces. These can be remelted for other candles later, so save them.
 This should remove some of the carbon or oil film found on some non-paraffin wax candles. This will also remove most of the flakes and chips of wax left over from removing the wax puck.
 Place the jar on the cloth.
 Add room temperature water to the pan so that it comes up to the side of the jar.
 Do not leave this jar unattended from here on in. Depending on the candle, the waxes melt at different temperatures. The column candles that you often see in Hispanic stores or in roadside memorials melt at very low temperatures, some can be spooned out at room temperature. This wax is not good to add to other waxes.
 Turn the heat down when the temperature reaches 140° - 160°. Paraffin, bees wax, and soy wax all melt at different temperatures. You don't want this to just be melted, you want the wax to be as liquid as possible. The wax chips should all be melted and floating on the top of the water at this point.

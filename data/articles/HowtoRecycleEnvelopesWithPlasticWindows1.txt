 If you have a service that picks up your recycling every week or month, you can call their number. If you take your recycling to a location, then check with the people inside the building the next time you take other recycling.


If you are in an office, ask your office manager how the company handles recycling. Some companies view envelopes as confidential materials and would prefer envelopes with plastic windows to be shredded.
You can offer to do research about local recycling agencies, if your office does not currently recycle. Some cities and states offer incentives to offices that are looking to become more "green.";
, You can usually look in the local yellow pages to find recycling centers or call your local chamber of commerce. They may offer a booklet with trash and recycling information to residents.


Small towns usually have limited recycling options. You can drive to a local recycle drop off or call a larger city nearby that may recycle more. Medium-sized towns may have private services that offer monthly fee-based roadside pickups. Large towns and suburbs may have trash and recycling services as part of the city services. If that is the case, there is probably a list on the city website that will tell you what is recyclable.
 Most recycling centers have a way to filter out the plastic window from the envelope and paper.
 You will need to throw away the plastic and glue, and place the envelope with the other paper recycling.

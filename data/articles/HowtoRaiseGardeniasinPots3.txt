 If you expect to have to bring Gardenias in over winter because you live in a cold climate, do yourself a favor by planting them in lighter container materials. You may otherwise find it too difficult to try to bring the heavy pots in for the winter.


Light materials include plastic (you can put the ugly plastic pot inside a more attractive pot).
You could also put your pot on a pot trolley to make heavier pots easier to move.
 In zones 6 and cooler itâ€™s important to bring Gardenias outside only in warmer temperatures. The rest of the time they will need to be in heated spaces indoors.


Zone 6 temperatures can drop down to -10 degrees Fahrenheit (-23.3 degrees Celsius)., A general purpose fertilizer given over six weekly intervals is ideal. Reduce watering over winter but do not allow the plant to dry out completely.

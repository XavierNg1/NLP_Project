 Depending on the place, accommodation can go fast. Consider whether you are taking kids or pets, how far you want to drive, whether you want to camp or stay in a hotel, and whether you want to go somewhere popular or more secluded. Check if there's any upcoming concerts or shows in the area that you'd like to see.;
, Focus on toning your stomach and legs.
 Take children's, hygiene, pet's and bedding requirements into consideration. Some beach houses have pillows etc. others don't. Check with the manager if you're unsure. A small first aid kit is handy, just in case.
 Take a beach ball, soccer ball, volleyball or beach cricket set if you want.
 Some water and snacks in a cooler bag are great if you stop for a picnic on the way.
 Familiarize yourself with shops, the way to the beach etc.
 It's best to sleep in light cotton clothing in the heat, and make sure there is protection from mosquitoes and/or flies when you're sleeping. They get really annoying and may carry disease in some places.
 Fresh orange juice can be wonderful on hot mornings. Perhaps you could go for a walk or run on the beach, go buy the paper, sunbathe, or catch some early morning breakers.
 Sunbathe, surf, boogie board, whale watch, whatever.

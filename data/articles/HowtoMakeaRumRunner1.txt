 Traditionally, Rum Runners are served in Hurricane glasses, but if you don't have one, any sort of glass will work. Garnish with an orange slice or lemon slice.
 One popular Rum Runner tradition is to add a thin layer of Bacardi 151 on top of the drink. This highly alcoholic liquor floats above the blended ingredients and gives the drink a fiery initial "kick". To add a Bacardi "floater", carefully pour 1 oz (30 mL) of Bacardi 151 over the top of the finished drink.


Try not to pour the liquor all at once - it'll "break through" the top of the blended ingredients and give the entire drink a strong taste.

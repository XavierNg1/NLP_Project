 For a stronger tea, use 7 bags, and for a lighter tea use 5. The recommended brand of tea bags that are specifically made for Southern sweet tea is Luzianne. However, you can also use Lipton, Tetley, or any other brands of black tea., Make sure you're using a Pyrex glass container or another container that can hold boiling water. The glass container should be at room temperature -- if it's cold, it may crack., This will give you a nice, strong tea. Do not put tea bags directly into boiling water. This will cause a bitter taste or may even make the bags burst.
 You can gently press the tea bags against the Pyrex cup using a wooden spoon, but you should not squeeze the tea bags or the tea will have a bitter taste. If you'd like to protect the tea from being bitter, add 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda just in case.
, Add a cup of sugar to the mixture and stir until the sugar is dissolved. The hot water will melt the sugar and make it dissolve in the tea. If you add sugar to cool water, it won't fully dissolve. You can use artificial sweetener instead of sugar, too. It'll be more healthy, but not quite as tasty.
 This will distribute the flavor of the tea and will fill the pitcher. Use fresh cool filtered water instead of tap water for a less cloudy tea.
 Do not put the pitcher directly into the refrigerator -- let it cool to room temperature on the counter. If you put hot tea into the fridge, it will turn cloudy. Wait for it to cool down before you put it in the fridge., When you're ready to serve the tea, you can garnish it with a few lemon slices or sprigs of mint, and then pour it into a cool glass filled with ice.

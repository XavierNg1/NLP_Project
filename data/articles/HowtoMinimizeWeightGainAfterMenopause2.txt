 Aerobic exercise burns calories, which is a weight control basic.


Aerobic activity entails using a group of muscles for 15 to 20 minutes while your heart beats at 60 to 80 percent of its maximum capacity.
Walking, jogging, dancing, biking, swimming and cross-country skiing are all forms of aerobic activity.
Aerobic exercise helps relieve stress, tones up muscles and may reduce stomach spread.
 Lifting weights will tone up muscles and rebuild muscle mass. Having a slightly heavier muscle mass will help you to burn more calories.

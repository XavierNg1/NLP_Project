You can open a document to print, such as a Word file, or you can navigate to a web page to print. Whichever it is, ensure that whatever you want to print is open and visible on the computer. It is impossible to print if the document to be printed is not open.
Check the web page to see if there is a printer friendly link, usually outlined as "Printer Friendly Version." If there is no printer friendly version of the page you want, you may need to copy and paste the content into a Word document and print from there (though this is not absolutely necessary). Copying to a Word document is especially true for printing emails, particularly those other than Outlook.;

If there is no Print button, click File. This should be located towards the top of the window for both Macs and PCs.
If printing from a web browser, you may need to click some type of menu button.



If you wish to see what the document will look like once printed, click print preview. You can print from that window or skip this step altogether.



From the File menu, click Print. This will bring up the printing menu.



Find the button which will allow you to access the more advanced settings. This menu will allow you to change paper sizes, source, and type, as well as a variety of other options depending on the program you are using. Go through these settings and make sure they are what you want.



Returning to the print menu, you will have the option to choose your printer, color or grayscale, landscape or portrait view, number of copies, etc. Ensure that the options are set to whatever you desire.



Once your settings are to your satisfaction, just click "OK."

 Once you've got the basic movement mastered, you need to learn how to move in and out of the trick with some smooth movements, instead of just clearly setting up the trick before your audience's eyes., Your fingers should be on the side of your arm facing your audience and your thumb should be on the other side of your arm, where it is visible only to you., You can wiggle your fingers a little if you want to make it dramatic and also draw the audience's eyes away from your thumbs. Hold your left thumb up, away from your hand., As soon as your left thumb is covered, pop your thumbs into position. You will be making the switch behind the cover of your fingers, bending your left and right thumbs and bringing them together, knuckle-to-knuckle.

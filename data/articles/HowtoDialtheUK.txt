 An exit code permits you to dial out of your country and is a necessary part of any international phone call, no matter which country you end up dialing. Before dialing specific digits to connect you to your UK contact, you will need to dial the exit code specific to the country you are dialing out of.


There is no single exit code that works with every country. You will need to find out the specific exit code to use for your country. Note, however, that some countries do share exit codes with others.
The exit code is always dialed first. As such, the basic format to use is: EC-xx-xxxxxxxxxx, with “EC” standing for “exit code.”
Example: The exit for the United States is “011.” When dialing the UK from the US, you would begin by dialing 011-xx-xxxxxxxxxx.;
, The country code for the entire United Kingdom is "44." Dial this immediately after your exit code in order to direct the phone call to the UK.Note that this country code is shared by all countries within the UK.
Example: When dialing from the US, begin with 011-44-xxxxxxxxxx.
 In order to reach a land line in the UK, you will need to know which geographic region that land line exists in. This region will determine the correct area code to dial.


Area codes can vary in length from two to five digits.
The correct format for dialing to a country in the UK is EC-44-AC-xxxxxxxx, with "AC" standing for "area code."
Note, however, that if you need to dial a mobile phone, you will dial a mobile code instead of an area code. You will need to inquire about the correct mobile code when acquiring the phone number, but most mobile codes are four digits long and begin with the number 7. That 7 is usually followed by a 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
 The rest of the phone number is simply the subscriber's personal phone number. Dial it as you would dial any local subscriber's number to complete the phone call.


The personal phone number for a land line is usually 10 digits long, not including the area code.
The personal phone number for a mobile phone is usually 10 digits long, including the mobile code.
 If you live in the United Kingdom and need to dial another country within the United Kingdom, you do not need to dial an exit code or country code, even though the phone call is, in some sense, international. Skip these two pieces of information when placing the call.
 Instead of dialing an exit code and country code, you need to dial “0” before placing a call to another country within the United Kingdom. This is a “trunk code” which signifies that your call is a “National Destination Code” (NDC) or, in other words, a call placed within the United Kingdom.The basic format for a call from one UK country to another is: 0-xxxxxxxxxx.
 When dialing a land line in the UK, you need to dial the area code of the geographic region that land line exists in. Area codes are usually two to five digits long.


The correct format for dialing to a UK country from another UK country is 0-AC-xxxxxxxx, with "AC" standing for "area code."
If dialing a mobile phone, replace the area code with a mobile code. You will need to find out the correct mobile code when you receive the phone number, but most mobile codes are four digits long and begin with the number 7. That 7 is usually followed by the number 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
 Dial the rest of the phone number as you would dial any local number. The remainder should just be the subscriber's personal phone number.


A land line will usually be 10 digits long without the area code.
A mobile phone will usually be 10 digits long including the mobile code.

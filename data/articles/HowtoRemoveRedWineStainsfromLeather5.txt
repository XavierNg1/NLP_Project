 Shake the bottle well. Squirt a small amount of white, foaming shaving cream on the stain., Gently massage the shaving cream into the stain with a clean rag or towel. Do not be too rough.
 Blot the shaving cream off with a clean paper towel. Do not rub, just dab it gently. Let it dry for at least 24 hours., Use a soft cloth to rub a small amount of leather conditioner into the affected area. This will help restore the leatherâ€™s texture. Let it dry again.

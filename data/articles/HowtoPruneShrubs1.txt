 Shrubs that are old or overgrown may need to be pruned over several years. This is called renewal or renovation pruning. Start by using hand shears and lopping shears to remove any old stems on the shrub. Cut them off at a 45 degree angle.Remove any part of the stem or branch that is brown, dried out, or discolored. Get rid of stems that have no growth or buds on them.
This type of thinning is good for shrubs with multiple stems, such as lilac, viburnum, forsythia, and dogwood.;
, Hard pruning is a drastic way to prune an old shrub so it grows better the following season. Use lopping shears and a pruning saw to cut back all the stems on the shrub to within an inch of the ground. Do this during winter or fall. In the spring, the shrubs should produce new shoots and new growth.Hard pruning will stimulate new growth, but there wonâ€™t be much for you to look at while the shrub recovers in the winter. In the spring, it should bloom and appear more healthy.
 In the following season, as the overgrown or old shrub comes back to life, treat it like a young or newly planted shrub. You may head trim the shrub and pinch out any new buds. You can also start to shape the shrub to encourage it to grow evenly.

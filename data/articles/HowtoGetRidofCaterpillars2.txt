 Pyrethrins are a natural pesticide that is made from plants, specifically chrysanthemums. They are toxic to many pests, including caterpillars. Generally, it is safe for humans and pets, but it could be toxic if ingested in huge amounts. These are typically sold in garden and home improvement stores. The product is typically sprayed directly on infested plants, and is degraded within a few days by sunlight.If you go shopping for pyrethrin pesticides, you will likely come across products that contain “pyrethroids,” these are simply synthetically produced versions of pyrethrum.
You can protect beneficial insects from being harmed by this product by applying it to the affected plants early in the morning, and then cover the plant with an old sheet for 24 hours., This type of spray should be applied directly to the caterpillars. It works because the soap destroys the skin of the caterpillar. In order to make this spray, simply mix two tablespoons of soap into one quart of water into a spray bottle. Shake the mixture well, and then spray it directly on any caterpillars you find.Make sure the soap is biodegradable and plant based in order to avoid harming plants, animals, and bugs that don’t harm your plants.
 This should be considered a last resort given the harmful effects pesticides can have on beneficial insects and the environment, but if you must use a pesticide, make sure that it is designed to work against caterpillars. You can find all of this information on the label.Remember that if you have pets or small children, using a pesticide may harm them if they come in contact with the pesticide.
It is not a good idea to use pesticides in gardens where there are plants that will be eaten.

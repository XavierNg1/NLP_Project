 Line your baking sheet with a piece of wax paper or parchment paper. The lined baking sheet will serve as your surface for creating and freezing your bacon rolls.
 You can lay your bacon onto your prepared baking sheet or roll your bacon as you pull it out of the package. Begin on one end of the bacon strip and roll it until the entire piece is wrapped around itself., Be sure that the end of your bacon roll is on the bottom so that the bacon doesn’t uncoil. Your bacon will resemble the shape of a snail.Be sure that the bacon rolls aren’t touching each other.
 Once you have completed all of your bacon rolls, place the baking sheet into your freezer.Wait until the bacon is frozen solid.
 Once your bacon has frozen into the rolls, you can take them off the baking pan, place them in an airtight container or freezer bag, and put them back in the freezer immediately.You can now use your bacon as needed. You won’t need to pry frozen bacon off of wax paper, and the bacon strips will only be frozen to themselves (not each other).

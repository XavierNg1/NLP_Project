 Visit the Google Maps website, or open the Google Maps app on your phone.
 Type an address into the Google Maps search bar and click on the Search icon. A marker should appear at that address.


If Google Maps doesn't recognize the address, drag the map around to find it. Click (or press and hold) its location (or the nearest street), and a small popup at the base of the screen will show an approximate address. Click that address to make a marker.
 Click the Save button with the star icon, in the left hand pane. This marks the location with a yellow star, as long as you're signed in to Google.


The Google Maps app can also set special locations, such as Home and Work. Visit "Your Places" under settings to get started.
 If you are using the phone app, you can easily send it to other users. Tap on the marker to open a place info card. Swipe up on this card and tap Share.

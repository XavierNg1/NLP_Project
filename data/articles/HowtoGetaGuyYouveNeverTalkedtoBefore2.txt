 Introduce yourself and chat him up with some small talk. If he responds well, think about building on this and becoming friends first.


Talk about anything from the weather to something you’ve noticed about him like the band on his t-shirt. Try something along the lines of, "I love that band too! Have you seen them in concert before?"

, Show him that you are interested by flirting. Act coy, bat your eyes, touch your hair and poke fun. Be sure not to hurt his feelings of course, just a little playful banter will do the trick. Let him see your true personality and witty humor. Gaze into his eyes for several seconds and then look away. It works every time.
 Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet. Take matters into your own hands by inviting him out for a movie or any other activity you feel he may be interested in. Be polite, warm and personable. There’s no way he could turn you down.


Walk over to him with confidence, a big smile and direct eye contact. He will not only be flattered but taken by your straightforward approach.
 Write your telephone number on a piece of paper along with your name. Walk over to him in class, at the mall or wherever you tend to run into him and hand it to him. You could say, "Hey, I think you should give me a shout sometime." He’ll be left stunned about who this mystery girl is and might start dialing/texting immediately.


If he doesn’t call, he was clearly not the person you hoped he would be and now you can finally move on.
 If this is an online crush, send him a private message on Facebook. Tell him that you’ve noticed him around and wanted to get to know him better. End the message by asking an open-ended question like, “Would you be interested in meeting up?” or “Can I get your phone number so we can talk sometime?”By doing this, you will encourage a response.


This option is an excellent choice if you are a little on the shy side.

 Set the onion down on its side, with the root and tapered ends sticking out to the sides. Use a sharp knife to slice off one of the curved sides by ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter)./images/thumb/3/34/Cut-an-Onion-Step-12-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Cut-an-Onion-Step-12-Version-6.jpg

Do not cut off the root or tapered end just yet.
 Use your fingers of a knife to pry the dry, papery outer layer from the onion. Grab it from the side you just cut, and pull it away. You may have to peel away several layers.

, This will help keep the onion steady and prevent it from rolling around as you cut. The root and tapered ends should still be sticking out to the sides., Leave the stubby, root-end exposed. You will be cutting from this end first.

, Begin slicing the onion at the root end, and finish slicing at the tapered end.Make sure that the knife is very sharp. You can slice the onion as thick or as thin as you want to. Something between ⅛ and ¼ inch (0.32 and 0.64 centimeters) would be ideal.

Thicker slices are great for frying, while medium ones are ideal for burgers.
Slice the onion as thin as possible if you are making a salad.
 Once you have finished slicing the onion, discard the root and tapered ends. Use your fingers to gently pop the rings out of each other.

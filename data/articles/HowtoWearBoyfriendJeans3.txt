 Boyfriend jeans are most commonly paired with heels, because these shoes give the jeans a dressy, feminine, and fun look. You can wear plain black heels or pink shoes with a funky pattern like animal print for a more fun and carefree look. If you really want to show off your heels, then you should wear cuffed boyfriend jeans. Here are some great types of heels to wear with your latest pair of boyfriend jeans:

, For a more casual look, you can rock your boyfriend jeans with any everyday pair of sneakers, clogs, slippers, or any pair of comfy, casual shoes that looks good with boyfriend jeans.

This is the simplest way to stack hay, and therefore the easiest for the stacking team to follow. But, it is not the most stable.
Vertically, the bales will form four-bale columns, and between these columns, the stack can collapse (as indicated by the red lines in the above diagram). If you are not making a very tall stack (4 bales or less), this won't be as much of an issue.

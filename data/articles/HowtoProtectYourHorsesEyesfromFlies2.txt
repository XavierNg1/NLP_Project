 A fly mask is a fitted, mesh barrier worn on your horse’s head that can very effectively protect their eyes from flies and other insects. There are masks that cover only the top half of the face, full-face styles (that cover the nose), and masks that completely cover the face and ears. Experiment with different styles to find the right level of coverage and comfort for your horse., In order for a fly mask to be effective, it is crucial to find the right fit. You must be sure that the fly mask is not too loose or too tight on your horse. Additionally, you must check to see that the ear coverings are a comfortable fit. A poor fitting fly mask can lead to irritation, and may even injure the eyes of your horse.For a proper fit:

The mask's lower edge should reach 1-1.5 inches (2.5-3.8 cm) below the bottom of your horse's cheekbone.
There should be a couple of fingers' width between the mask edge and your horse's throatlatch.
Make sure that the mask's ear coverings and/or ear-holes are aligned with your horse's ears. Also, make sure the openings are roomy enough for his ear size.
Finally, be sure that the eye coverings rest far away from the eyes, with enough clearance for the horse's eyelashes. (You should never see eyelashes poking through the mesh).
 If you have a picky horse that doesn’t seem to like wearing a fly mask, you can opt for minimalist mesh fly strips that go over your horse’s eyes. These may be slightly less effective than a full mask, but they are a good choice for some horses.

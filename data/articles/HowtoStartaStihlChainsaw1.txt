 If you have a gas-powered chainsaw, it will need to be fueled up before using it. Before starting it, you should make sure that the fuel cap is securely fastened, and that there are no drips or pools of fuel on the outside of the chainsaw.If you see any fuel on the outer parts of the chainsaw, carefully wipe it away.
Always start your chainsaw well away from fuel sources.;
, On a gas-powered Stihl chainsaw, the chain brake is located just in front of the handlebar. All you have to do to activate it is push it forward. This will keep the chain locked as a safety precaution while you are starting the chainsaw, and until you are ready to use the tool., Your chainsaw may be equipped with a sheath or cover that goes over the chain and bar. If so, remove it before starting the chainsaw. That way, your tool will be ready to use once you start it., Typically, only professional-grade Stihl chainsaws have a decompression valve, so if you have a home or consumer-grade model, you will skip this step. If you have a professional saw, simply press the valve down (it will be located on the top of the chainsaw, near the starter rope)., Many Stihl models have a primer valve located on the side of the tool, near the handlebar. If yours has one, simply push it down several times. Don’t worry about the number of times you press the valve.-Several pushes won’t flood the engine, only circulate the fuel., Press and hold the throttle trigger lockout (located on the side of the chainsaw, above the trigger) with your thumb, then move the master control (on the left of the rear of the chainsaw) down as far as it will go. This is the position you should start the chainsaw in the first time you use it each session.If you have recently used the chainsaw, turned it off for a few minutes, and are ready to use it again, set the master control to the warm start setting before beginning. This is located one notch up from the lowest setting.

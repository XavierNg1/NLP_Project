 Catching turtles by hand with this method works best when attempting to catch small turtles.


If you want to catch a large turtle, you can probably just sneak up on it and grab it by its sides.
Beware of snapping turtles! They have long necks that can reach back and snap your fingers! It's best to just let them be.
 Wiggle your fingers around slowly. This should draw the attention of turtles, as you are mimicking the movement of insects on the surface of the water.
 However, don't let it get close enough to bite you. You will need to assess when it has gotten close enough to grab with your other hand.
 If you are afraid to pick the turtle with your hands, bring a small container to scoop it up with or you can wear gardening gloves or snow gloves so you won't get scratched or bitten.
 While it's great to get an up close look at a wild animal, don't take it out of its natural habitat permanently. Native turtle species populations, like those of many wild animals, are sadly in decline all over the world.We need to help them survive by letting them live in their natural environments.

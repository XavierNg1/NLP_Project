 If you have art work that does not have a place, hang it up behind your buffet. If you stocked your buffet with a lot of shorter objects, the wall behind it may need filling. Try hanging up some artwork just behind your buffet.Hang the artwork so it's a little above any items on the buffet. You don't want the artwork to be hidden. Strive to hang a painting at least a few inches above any items on the buffet.
Choose art work that matches the color scheme of your room and your buffet. If you're going for a bright primary color scheme, a pastel impressionist painting may not work. However, an abstract painting that uses pastels will match great with your buffet table.
 A mirror can be an attractive addition to the wall behind the buffet. It can also help if you want to double the buffet as a vanity area in your home. You can stand before the buffet to do your hair and makeup.As with hanging paintings, try to hang the mirror at least a few inches above any decorations on the buffet.
If you want to use the buffet as a vanity, the mirror may look best in the center of the buffet table. This way, things like makeup and hair brushes can be placed on either side of the mirror for your use.
 If you don't want to put photos directly on the buffet, you can hang them up on the wall behind it. This can work if you have children or animals that may knock breakable frames off of the buffet table.As you decide where to hang the photos on the wall, strive for balance just like you would with items on the buffet table. Imagine a line going down the wall in the middle of the buffet. Now imagine a mirror image pattern on either side of the line with photographs and pictures, selecting similar sizes and shapes for frames and photos on either side of the wall. The photos don't need to form a perfectly symmetrical pattern, though; balancing sizes and shapes is more important.
Make sure any photos you hang up are a few inches above any decorations on the buffet.

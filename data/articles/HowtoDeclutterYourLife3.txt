 Control the temptation to hoard things. Each time that an object comes into your sphere of possession, consider whether you truly need to keep this thing. If you do not need this thing, then let it go. Move on.Resist the urge to buy things you don't need. Catch yourself when you are buying things on impulse rather than for a practical use. Think: "Will I be glad that I bought this thing in a week? A month? A year?"
Learn to let go. Practice turning away from opportunities that aren't relevant to you right now.
 Be more mindful of where you leave things. When you are holding something in your hands, make sure that you put it away in its right place before you move on to a new task or a new object. It is easy to let your space become cluttered when you are constantly flitting from scene to scene, leaving a trail of forgotten objects in your wake. Try to build a mindfulness practice around reducing clutter.
 It can be easy to say "yes" to too many things and lose sight of what you really need to be doing. Find your focus. Do not limit yourself, but try to keep an even keep. Be careful not to let your life become so cluttered that you cannot keep track of where you're going.


Tell yourself that you cannot flake out of any plans that you make. Teach yourself to be more intentional about choices and commitments in your everyday life.

Get a black bridal veil. You can buy them by the yard from an arts and crafts store (or you can get them from a nearby 'Goth' bride).

This helps to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.


Stretch a piece over lens and bayonet (usually about 4 inches square) the lens hood over the material.

It will tear up due to this use eventually, but buying it by the yard is fairly inexpensive.
'Black dot' filters can also be bought for a similar effect but aren't as easily portable.
For an even further amount of diffusion, rubber band the material around the lens. Because it is further away from the lens, it will soften it even more.


Open up the lens a half stop from the meter reading, however you acquire it.
 This has three strengths for different effects. The advantage to this is no exposure compensation.



Get a beat-up, ratty skyline filter.
Use clear nail polish and create some of the suggested effects to start with and then add to your collection.

Leave clear a slightly off-center circle about 3/8s of an inch. Apply small streaks of polish radiating outward from the clear area. This will apply minimal diffusion.
Leave the same area clear but cover the remainder of the lens with a heavy layer of polish. This is a moderate edge diffusion.
Try the previous effect, but when it is almost dry, stipple the painted area with the nail brush. This is a super soft diffusion.

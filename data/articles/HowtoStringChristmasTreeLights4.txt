 Christmas tree lights can be end to end or stacked. End to end is also known as string to string. Stacked plugs can join more light strands together relative to string to string plugs. Read the boxes to ensure that your lights are compatible before purchasing., Don’t plug more than two extension cords to one another and make sure that they can handle the wattage of the bulbs. Only buy the lengths of light string and extension cord that you will be using. Make sure that all the lights you are using have the same wattage to prevent power surges. This will also prolong the life of your lights., Make sure all the lights work before placing them on your tree. You don’t want any live wires or broken bulbs in your tree as they can be fire hazards., Miniature white lights make great base lighting when coupled with strands of larger cool-burning bulbs that come in a variety of colour. You may also add novelty lights like flashing lights, flickering flames, bubble lights, or lights of various shapes along with miniature lights.

 John 14:2-3 tells us that heaven is a place, where Jesus has gone to prepare homes for those who follow and love him.;
, In heaven, we are with Jesus. But on this earth, we can be with him as well, by simply praying and engaging in a relationship with him. Jesus prayed that his followers would do God's will "on earth as it is in heaven." That's a goal of a life of faith.
 In his book "Heaven Revealed" Dr. Paul Enns, a pastor and theologian, writes: "We will excitedly greet one another at that glorious reunion with our believing loved ones. The very moment earth’s door closes and heaven’s door opens—at that very moment—there will be an excited, joyful, and exuberant reunion." (p. 43)

, Have you ever engaged in work that you love here on earth--something you feel you were "made to do"? Christians believe that we will have that opportunity in heaven as well. Dr. Enns writes: "The spiritual gifts we were given at salvation constitute who we are as believers. In continuity with who we are, we will continue to exercise our spiritual gifts. We will be serving, teaching, exhorting, giving, leading and showing mercy according to our giftedness (Rom. 12:7-8)." (p. 144)

, "We will have strength, energy, abilities and use of all faculties in an inconceivable dimension." (Heaven Revealed)

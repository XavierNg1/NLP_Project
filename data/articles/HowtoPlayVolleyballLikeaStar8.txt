 Saving a ball from the net is easy, if you have great reflexes. When the ball hits the middle of the net and bounces back, run and penguin slide to the ball at last resort if you cannot get to it in time. NEVER slide on your knee pads as this is harmful to your knees.
 Set up like you are going to bump, but not until the last second. Then, shrug and hit.
 Run, slide, and bump. Try to bump it behind you for another teammate to hit over. Do this by bring your arms farther back (like a miniature swing of the arms), or arching your back as you make contact with the ball.

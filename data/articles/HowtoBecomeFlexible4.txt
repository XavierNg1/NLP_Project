Stretch down toward your knees. Do not bend your head to face your knees, face forward.
This will also stretch your neck muscles; if it hurts your neck to do this exercise, face your knees and stretch.
 Do the same with your left leg.
 If you are advanced and flat on the ground, take a sofa pillow and put one of your legs on it to give more of a stretch.



To get started, lay flat on the ground and then sit up.
Reach for your toes.
Look at your knees and hold for about 20 to 30 seconds.
 Keep the bottom of the feet pressed together, then pull them towards you.
 Kneel down, one leg front, one at the back; when your legs are at 90 degrees, push down. Then straighten your front leg.
 Open your legs as widely as possible while sitting. Lean left and right, very gently, while in this position.

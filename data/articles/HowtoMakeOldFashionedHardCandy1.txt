 You need to be thoroughly aware of what the recipe requires before starting because candy needs precise temperature control and precise actions at the times that the recipe states. Most importantly, remember that candy not attended to is candy that burns!

, Candy should not be made when the weather is high in humidity or rainy or it has a hard time setting. Check the room temperature––it should be around 60ºF-68ºF (15.5ºC-20ºC), with low humidity.


If you have no choice about cooking in sub-optimal temperature conditions, you may be able to compensate by cooking the candy 1 to 2 degrees higher than recommended by the recipe.
Altitude will affect the outcome; if you live at high altitude, you may need to make adjustments in accordance with the usual recommendations for high altitude cooking.
 You need to be happy about working with great precision when making candy––it's a science as well as an art.

 This ensures more even heating.
 This can be done manually or using a thermometer. The thermometer is easiest, but it's handy to know how to test the temperature manually, which you can learn to do before using a recipe by reading How to test candy hardness stages.

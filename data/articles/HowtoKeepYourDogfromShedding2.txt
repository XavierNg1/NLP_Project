 As a general rule, it is always best to brush your dog before bathing it to remove mats that will make shampooing difficult. Start brushing your pet at its rear legs and move upwards. Brush against the grain of its coat to ensure that the water penetrates it more easily. Pre-bath brushing also removes dead or loose hair that would a nuisance when washing.
 Always opt for a shampoo made for dogs when bathing your pet, available at pet stores and online. Regular shampoos are harsher than dog shampoo, which is designed with a specific PH level for dogs. Human shampoo will wash away protective, essential oils from your dog's coat, leaving it open to bacteria and parasites.To further protect your dog’s sensitive skin, opt for a dog shampoo with no artificial fragrances or colors added.
 Lead your dog into the shower and have it stand on a towel or non-slip mat on the shower floor. Wet and shampoo your dog’s coat from back to front, lathering gently. If your dog has thick fur, try using a brush to run the shampoo through its coat rather than using your fingers., Using a removable shower head or bowl for water, rinse the shampoo out of your dog’s coat. Be sure to remove all residue, which can cause skin irritation if left on the skin’s surface. Take care to avoid getting water in your dog’s eyes when rinsing., Gently squeeze extra water out of your dog’s coat. Take a step back to let it shake off excess water, then pat it down with a large towel. Turn your blow dryer to low setting and gently blow dry your dog to remove excess water. Hold the blow dryer at a distance to remove overheating your dog or matting its hair.

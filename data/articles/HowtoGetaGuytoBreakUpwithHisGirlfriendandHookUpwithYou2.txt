 Your attire should be sexy but classy. Keep your hair and make-up natural while still standing out. You want him to see that you are physically appealing as well.
 A guaranteed way to make a guy attracted to you is by making him jealous and making yourself seem unattainable. Talk with other boys and give them attention when he is in the same area. Observe his reaction. If he is staring at you while you do this, it is probably a good sign.
 Wear a nice smelling perfume and walk by him. Observe his reaction once you pass.

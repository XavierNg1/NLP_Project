 Try to find a cozy spot close to a heater. Don't build your fort too close to a window or entrance, because that is where all the cold air comes from.;
, Try to build your fort near a fan or air conditioning unit. You can build your fort near an open window, but only if the window is shady and there is no sun coming in through it. An open window may bring in a cool, fresh breeze, but it can also let the hot sun in!


If you can build your fort in a basement, then even better! Basements are nice and cold during the summer, and the floor will keep you cool.
 Anything too heavy, such as a comforter or a thick blanket will be too heavy and make your fort fall apart., If the base of your fort is made from chairs, tables, or sofas, then you should be able to drape a heavy blanket or comforter without the fort falling apart. Some seat cushions may be strong enough to hold up a heavy blanket or comforter, but they will need to be leaning against something.
 The cushions that come from the seats of sofas and armchairs make great walls, because they are stiff and shaped like blocks. They can stand up on their own without much help.
 The pillows that you use to sleep on don't make very good walls, but they are great for sitting on! Use them inside your fort to make things more comfy.
 Do not build your fort so that it is blocking a door. If something bad happens, you will be in trouble. Blocking doors may keep someone from coming to help you if something happens. It may also keep you from getting out.

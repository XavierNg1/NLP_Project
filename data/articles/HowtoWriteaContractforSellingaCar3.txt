 Many states have readymade Bill of Sale forms. These are relatively simple documents for sales that do not require special agreements or circumstances. To find such a form, visit your state’s DMV or Department of Transportation website. Then search for a Bill of Sale. Print out the document.


For example, you can find the California state DMV’s Bill of Sale here and the Arizona Department of Transportation’s Bill of Sale here


, The Bill of Sale will likely be split into a buyer’s section and a seller’s section. You will have to fill out the party and vehicle information on each section, so each party can keep a copy for her own records.


Information you can expect to fill out includes the car’s VIN, make, and model, the name and permanent address of each party involved, and the sales amount. There will also be spaces in which each party involved will sign and date the document., Bill of Sale forms will also have spaces to indicate whether the vehicle is a gift or donation.Make sure you fill out this portion of the Bill of Sale for tax purposes.


In some states, you may be able to transfer the title to a family member or relative for free or a low fee. If you want to give the car as a gift, you may need an additional form, such as the Affidavit of Motor Vehicle Gift Transfer in Texas.It used to be that you could “sell” a car for $1, thereby allowing the buyer to avoid paying significant sales taxes. Most states have found ways to circumvent this. For example, in Texas, if you are selling a car, the buyer will pay motor vehicle sales tax of 6.25% on either the purchase price or the “standard presumptive value” of the car, whichever is highest. The state of Texas determines the standard presumptive value., The parties may want to include additional information missing from the preexisting Bill of Sale.An addendum can include such information as: the vehicle being sold “as is,” requirement for the seller to provide the title or upkeep documents, known defects, smog certification, or additional identifying information for the vehicle like mileage or interior color. You should also include information above the addendum linking it to the Bill of Sale, such as:


This is an addendum to the sales contract made between the Seller, ___________________, and the Buyer, _________________, and dated ______________, regarding the vehicle with VIN number ______________________.
Have a witness present, and make sure all parties date the addendum after both printing and signing their names.
 An owner may only sell a vehicle if it has a clear title, which means that there are no liens on the title for car loans or other legal action against the owner. In some cases, a seller can sell a car when the bank still holds the title (i.e., the seller still owes money on the car).


You can include “boilerplate” language to indicate the status of the title if you own the car, such as the following: “The Seller warrants that 1) the Seller is the legal owner of the car; 2) the car is free from all liens and encumbrances; 3) the Seller has full right and authority to sell and transfer the car; and 4) the Seller will warrant and defend the title of the car against any and all claims and demands of all persons.”Get a payoff letter from the financing company if you are still making payments on the car. This will provide exactly the amount of money that you still owe on the car, and which your buyer must pay to purchase the car.In most cases where a bank holds the vehicle title, the buyer writes one check directly to the bank for the payoff amount and another check to the seller for the remaining amount between the payoff and the sales price. In this case, the bank can usually mail the title to the buyer upon receiving the correct payoff amount., After both parties have filled out and signed the Bill of Sale, make sure that each person has a copy for their own records. The Bill of Sale will also make it easier when transferring the title of the vehicle.

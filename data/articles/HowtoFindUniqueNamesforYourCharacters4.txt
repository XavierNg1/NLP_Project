 Pick character names that correspond with the world, time frame, and/or country where your story is set.


It will add to the believability of your story if the character names sound appropriate for the setting. For example, a story set in China will likely have different character names than a story set in Africa.
Another technique, used by John Braine, is to use place names from the region or area the story takes place in.
 Most readers don’t have the patience to try to decipher a character name every time it’s mentioned. A hard to pronounce name may also break the flow of the story and take the reader out of the story, rather than immerse them further in it.


Look for names that are easy to say out loud and roll off your tongue.
Avoid using a lot of strangely spelled names for your characters as this could confuse and alienate your reader.
 The meaning of a name could help you connect the name with one of your characters, based on their personality. Think about how the meaning of the name reinforces the character’s personality traits.


You could also use a contrasting name to create some friction between the sound or meaning of the name and the personality of the character. For example, a tough girl could be named Lacey, or a nerdy kid could be named Brock.

 Magic erasers are cleaning sponges that use micro abrasive texture to scrub away stains. You can safely use magic erasers on many different types of surfaces, so this may be a good option for getting the dye or ink off of your wall.However, keep in mind that there is still a chance of discoloration.


To use a magic eraser, get the sponge wet and wring out the excess water, Then, rub the sponge over the dyed or ink-covered area of the wall until the dye or ink stain is gone.
 A bleach pen will lighten the dye or ink in a small area, so this may reduce the chances of discoloring the paint.


To use a bleach pen, go over the dyed or ink-covered areas with the tip of the bleach pen. The stains should lift after a few minutes.
 If you have white walls, then you can use some bleach cleanser to remove the stain. This is an effective way to get ink or dye off of your painted walls, but it will likely cause discoloration if your walls are not white.


To use a bleach cleanser, spray it directly onto the dye or ink, let it sit for a few minutes, and then wipe it away.
You should only use bleach cleanser as a last resort because it is the harshest option and there is a good chance that it will discolor your paint.

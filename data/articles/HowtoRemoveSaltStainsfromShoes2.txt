 Shoes are very susceptible to salt stains, especially in the winter when salt is everywhere. A protectant spray is necessary to keep your shoes resistant to salt stains.You can buy a protectant spray online or at a local shoe store.
You should spray the protectant spray 8 to 12 inches away from the shoe. Add two coats.
Check the label to make sure the spray is safe to use on your specific shoe type.
 In months where streets are being salted, water damage is also a major concern. Take steps to waterproof your shoes to keep them safe. A waterproof spray can help create a protective layer that will minimize water damage over the colder month.Choose a spray that's safe to use on your specific type of shoe. It should say somewhere on the bottle which materials a spray works for.
Make sure to read and follow the instructions of any water proof spray carefully. You usually spray it on in a similar fashion to which you would spray on a protectant spray.
 The longer you let stains sit, the worse they will be. If you notice a salt stain on your shoe, treat it right away. Putting off treating a stain can cause permanent damage to your shoes.

, It will come up with a list of things. Then along the top of it you should see three words, favourites, feeds and history. You should click on history and it will come up with a list of things, three weeks ago, last week and today.
 If you want to delete something you have been on in the last week do the same but click on the last week box instead of the three weeks ago box. If you want to delete something you have been today then do the same but click on the today box.
 Choose the thing you want to delete and right-click on it. It will come up a list of thing you can do to it. One of them should say 'delete'. Click on it and a box will come up on the computer screen saying 'are you sure you want to delete this item. If you click yes then it will be deleted. If you click no then it will remain in the history tab.

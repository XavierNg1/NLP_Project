 If you suffer from a variety of infections in several different organs or parts of your body, or have frequent (chronic) infections, you may have a primary immunodeficiency disease. Some of the most common conditions and infections that appear in cases of primary immunodeficiency include:Recurrent sinopulmonary infections, such as pneumonia (with fever), otitis media (inflammation of the ear, and sinusitis (chronic sinus infections)
Meningitis (inflammation of the swelling of tissues near the brain or spinal cord) or sepsis (a condition in which the blood becomes infected)
Gastrointestinal infections (infections of the gut)
Cutaneous infections (infections of the skin);
, In addition to cutaneous infections, you might develop any number of noninfectious skin conditions – rashes, sores, or scaly skin – if you have a primary immunodeficiency. These conditions include:Eczematous lesions (an area of damaged skin brought on by severe eczema, a condition that causes itchy, irritated skin)
Erythroderma (scaly skin)
Cutaneous granulomas (red, raised sores or bumps)
Dysplasia of skin (light pigmentation with dark skin covering areas that suffered injury), hair (uneven color or patchiness, or the absence of eyebrows), and nails (thick, flaky, ridged, or abnormally shaped)

, If you were prescribed antibiotics for an infection but they prove useless, you may have a primary immunodeficiency. On the other hand, if you’ve used a particular antibiotic for a long time, you may have developed resistance to that particular drug. In either case, let your doctor know that your antibiotics are ineffective so they can provide an accurate diagnosis.

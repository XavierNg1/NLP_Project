 If you're not going to use honey for a few months, it may crystalize. While this process is normal, and reversible, it can be a hassle. To prevent crystallization, you can store honey in the freezer. You will need a container with a little extra room, as honey will expand some when frozen. If you just bought a jar of honey, you may need to use some of the honey or transfer it to a bigger container to make room in the jar.Some people like to use an ice tray to freeze honey. This way, when you need honey, you can thaw out one cube at a time. You can freeze honey in an ice tray and then transfer the cubes to a plastic bag.
 Once you've transferred your honey to your chosen container, place it in the fridge. Honey can last a few years when stored in the freezer.While honey lasts a long time in the freezer, it's never a bad idea to write down the date on frozen food items.
 Thawing out honey is simple. You simply leave it in an airtight container and allow it to gradually thaw out at room temperature. Do not attempt to speed up the process of thawing out honey.

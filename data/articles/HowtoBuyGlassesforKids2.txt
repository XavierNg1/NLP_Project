 Since kids' faces and noses are still growing, it's often difficult to choose glasses with the right bridge fit. If the bridge doesn’t fit properly, the glasses will keep sliding down your child’s nose. Metal frames usually have adjustable nose pads that allow easy fitting with growing noses.Kids are likely to just look over the frame instead of pushing them back up into place. This is bad for their vision, especially since the way their brains process sight is still developing.
Your child’s eyes should be centered vertically and horizontally within the lenses to reduce distortions or the risk of developing other vision problems, so it’s important they sit on the nose securely., The most secure temple style for younger kids wraps all the way around the back of the ear and keeps the glasses from sliding down or completely dropping off a child's face. Typically called cable temples, they are great for babies, toddlers, and young children who are required to wear glasses at all times.If your child doesn’t have to wear glasses at all times, cable temples aren’t ideal since they’re a bit more awkward to put on and take off.
If you opt for a more conventional temple style, ensure the earpieces don’t hang too far down past the ear. Your child should be able to sit back comfortably against a headrest without it bumping and shifting the glasses out of place.An optician can help adjust the glasses after they are made to help make sure that the frames fit well.
 Since children can sometimes be careless or rough with their glasses, spring hinges can help avoid the need for replacing or fixing damaged eyewear. They allow the earpieces to flex away from the lens frames, avoiding damage or breaks. Although they are usually a bit more expensive, they can be a great investment in the long run.Spring hinges are particularly recommended for toddlers and youngsters who are likely to play with their glasses more or mishandle them.

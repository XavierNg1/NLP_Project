 For very tangled hair, use a wide-toothed comb. For regular upkeep of wavy hair or soft curls, use a paddle brush. Paddle brushes are flat, usually square, and usually have more bristles. This provides a larger surface area to run your hair through as you try to untangle it. The bristle material also makes a difference:


Boar bristles are a strong, natural material good for taming thick hair.
Nylon bristles are softer and slide more easily, good for fine or fragile hair.
More cushioning on the brush gives more flexibility but less pull. Some flexibility is good to avoid tugging, but keep the cushioning low if you have thick hair.
 Separate your hair into two halves, from front to back. Separate each of these in half again, on your left and right sides. Use clips to secure the sections you aren't currently brushing.


If you have extra thick hair, separate into additional sections.
 Starting at the base of the head is an easy way to do it. After you have worked through a section, just leave it down and go to the one above, without the lower one getting in the way.
 Brush each section of hair starting with the ends. Tease out each knot or tangle with repeated downward motions. Once finished, brush downward from a slightly higher position.
 When your hair is wet, it is at its weakest. The cuticles (outer hair walls) are expanded, soft, and full of water. However, combing wet hair is less painful on the scalp, and may make it easier to untangle. Brush very gently, to avoid breaking the hair.


When combing wet hair, a wide-toothed comb is safer than a brush. Progress to more and more narrow combs to get rid of smaller tangles.

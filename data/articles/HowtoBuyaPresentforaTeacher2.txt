 Teachers don’t always receive the verbal appreciation that they hope for and often times deserve. Writing a kind letter of thankfulness is a simple way to warm your teacher’s heart.

In your letter, you can write about the most interesting thing you’ve learned from your teacher or you can write about a good memory of when you really enjoyed yourself in their classroom.
 Making a gift yourself automatically adds a personal touch. Because they take time, thought, and effort, this kind of gift can be very touching for a teacher. Use your creativity and create something unique.


Homemade ornaments or a personalized set of classroom bookmarks are both examples of presents that you can make for your teacher.
 Instead of having your parents pick up something generic at the store, put personal thought into what your teacher would want. If you pick out the gift for a specific reason, it shows that you truly care.

For example, if you notice several times a week that your teacher has a certain soda on their desk, you could buy them a six pack of that soda.
 This is a nice way to capture the memories of the school year for your teacher to enjoy forever.

One option is to print one big class photo and have all of the students sign it to add a personal touch.
If you’re able to take photos in the classroom over an extended period of time, you could print several photos of the students and your teacher throughout the school year and put them together in an album for your teacher.You can use your creativity to use both photos and craft supplies to make a scrapbook.

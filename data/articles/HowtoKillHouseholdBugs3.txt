 A sticky trap, also known as a glue trap, is a great way of eliminating insects. Sticky trap typically contain an odor that attracts insects, who get stuck to their surface and die. Install the sticky trap in the kitchen or where you have seen the bugs. Leave the trap for a few days and check to see if any bugs have stuck. , A vinegar trap is especially useful for fruit flies. To create a vinegar trap, pour some white or apple cider vinegar into a bottle (even a small amount will do). With the cap of the bottle removed, stretch plastic wrap across the top the bottle and secure it with a rubber band or hair tie. Poke holes through the plastic wrap using a toothpick or similar item. The smell of vinegar attracts flies, who enter through the holes. The flies then either drown in the vinegar or are unable to get back out of the bottle. , Stores like Home Depot and Walmart carry a wide selection of traps, made to target all kinds of insects from hornets to stinkbugs. If you have a bug you can't get rid of, make a trip and select a trap that is made especially to attract and kill the pests in your home.

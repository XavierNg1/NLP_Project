If you are using an 8-inch (20.32 centimeters) round cake pan, the cake will be ready in about 30 to 40 minutes., At this point, your cake is done and ready to serve, but there's a few extra steps you can do to take it to the next level.If you'd like to serve your cake as is, consider dusting it with some powdered sugar., In a small saucepan, heat the sugar and lemon juice, stirring occasionally. When the sugar dissolves, pour the mixture over the still-warm cake.

Pour the mixture over the cake, and let it set.

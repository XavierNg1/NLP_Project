 It might be helpful to hire a professional cat trainer to come to your home and help you with the problematic behavior. A professional will be able to make sure that your home is set up in a way that is conducive to happiness and satisfaction for the cats.

A trained professional can also make observations about your cat’s specific behaviors and give you advice that is tailored specifically for your cat’s issues.
 If the behavior is getting out of hand, you may want to consider asking your veterinarian for their advice. A vet has trained experience working with problems like this and will be able to offer you additional recommendations.Your vet will also be able to check to see if there is any underlying medical condition causing the aggressive behavior.
Aggressive behavior can sometimes be linked to medical conditions that cause pain for your cat – like arthritis or dental diseases – or to central nervous system conditions such as hyperthyroidism., If you have tried adjusting your home and addressing the cat’s behavior, it might be time to consider some psychoactive medication like lorazepam. This kind of medication can help decrease the cat’s aggressive tendencies and alleviate a lot of the stress that your cats are feeling.This option should only be considered in extreme circumstances once you have attempted to alter the behavior in other ways.
These kinds of medication can have a sedating effect on the cat, which is normal. But you may need to change the dosage if your cat seems too sedated.

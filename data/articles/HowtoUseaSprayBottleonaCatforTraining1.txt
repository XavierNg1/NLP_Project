 It is important to purchase a brand new spray bottle to use for spray bottle training. Do not just rinse out an old cleaning solution bottle. Otherwise, you could be spraying dangerous chemicals onto your cat.


Fill up the bottle with plain cold or room temperature water.
Do not add any soap or other chemicals to the bottle. Just use plain water in the spray bottle.;
, Never use the spray bottle on your cat when he is being good. Only use it when you catch him doing something he is not supposed to do.


For example, if you notice that your cat is walking on the kitchen counter or scratching the sofa, then you could grab the bottle and use it on him. Don't use the bottle on him after he has already gotten down from the counter.
 When you spray the water at your cat, do not aim for his face. Aim for his belly or back and only spray the water bottle once. This should be enough to get your cat to stop doing what he is doing.


Make sure that you praise your cat when he stops the unwanted behavior. Pet him or give him a treat for stopping., If your cat sees that you are the on spraying water at him, then he may start to distrust you or even fear you.This can be a serious problem for your relationship with your cat. If he distrusts or fears you, then he might not allow you to approach him or pet him.


To avoid trust issues between you and your cat, try to hide the spray bottle from his view.
Put the spray bottle away in a cupboard after you are finished using it.

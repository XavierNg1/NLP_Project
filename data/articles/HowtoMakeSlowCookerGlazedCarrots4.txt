 Add 3 tablespoons (43 g) of melted butter, ¼ cup (85 g) of honey, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of fresh orange juice, 1 tablespoon (6 g) of orange zest, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of ground ginger, and ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of salt to the slow cooker. Whisk the ingredients together until they’re fully combined.If you like, you can mix the glaze the day before and store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator until you’re ready to make the carrots.
 Once the glaze is mixed, add 3 pounds (1350 g) of carrots that have been peeled and sliced into ¼ inch (6-mm) rounds to the slow cooker. Stir them into the glaze so they’re fully coated.You can peel and cut the carrots the day before, and store them in the refrigerator in zip-top plastic bags.
 When the carrots and glaze are mixed, cover the slow cook. Allow the carrots to cook on high heat for 2 to 3 hours, or until they are tender.Stir the carrots halfway through the cooking process to ensure that they’re heating evenly.
If you prefer, you can cook the carrots on low heat for 4 to 6 hours.
 When the carrots are finished cooking, remove them from the slow cooker with a slotted spoon. Transfer them to a bowl, and serve while they’re still warm.If you like, you can garnish the carrots with chopped, fresh parsley.

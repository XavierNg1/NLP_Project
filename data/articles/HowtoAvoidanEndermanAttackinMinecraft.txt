 There are two ways to provoke an enderman, which you'll want to keep from doing if at all possible:


If you strike an Enderman with an object or empty hand, it will become hostile toward you.
If you look directly at an Enderman (by putting your camera crosshairs on it), it will become hostile. The moment you look away it will begin trying to attack you.

Try backing into a building or cave with only two blocks of vertical space, since Endermen need at least three blocks of vertical space.
If you think you may have provoked an Enderman by looking at it, listen for a creepy sound of static and distortion, along with shaking and an open mouth on the Enderman's part. Any of these mean it has become hostile toward you








Endermen will not be provoked if looked at while wearing a pumpkin on one's head.;
, If you are being attacked by an enderman, then your savior will be water. If an enderman touches water, it will be damaged. So if you are being threatened by an enderman, just jump into a nearby lake or river.


Endermen will not burn in the sun like zombies and skeletons do, but they will teleport back to the end if the daylight comes out. So, if you see the sun coming up, don't worry if an enderman sees you; it will probably just go away.
It is good practise to carry a bucket of water in your hotbar at all times. When an enderman is provoked, place the water at your feet.
 The end is a dark spooky place that is only accessible by finding a stronghold and placing an eye of ender in each slot of the ender portal frame pieces. Endermen spawn crazily in the end and it is also the home of the black and purple boss, the ender dragon. Stay away from the end at all costs!

 Understandably, it can be hard to shop for someone who's more than 50 years older than you, but that's part of bridging the gap. Do you know what their interests are? Find out!;
, It'll probably be a quieter, slower day than you're used to, and that's okay. There was a time when silence didn't make people so uncomfortable, and your grandparents will enjoy the company. Do whatever they do; don't try to do what you want to do. Get a peek into what their daily lives are like. And don't judge or complain or criticize. Just try to appreciate the time you're spending with them.
 Let them tell you about what it was like when they were kids, even if you have heard the story a million times. Ask them about the most adventurous thing they ever did. Ask them who their first love was, their first kiss. Ask them when in their lives they felt the most happy, the most scared, the most excited. You might discover amazing things about them!


It might also get awkward if you find your grandparents pining for times gone past. You'll probably feel bad for bringing up memories that made them feel wistful. But by not asking about their lives, it'll show that you don't really care. And if you don't ask, who will? One day those memories will be lost if they don't share them with you.
Some grandparents will be closed off. They might not want to talk about their pasts. Don't push it.
Looking through old pictures together can be a good way to bond.
,, What's your daily life like? Who are you dating or crushing on? What are your goals? Give your grandparents a chance to get to know you. You may be surprised how interested they will be in the little things you have going on in your life.
 All they need is your love. Nothing else..

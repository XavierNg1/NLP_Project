 To win the game, you'll want to leave only aces on the table, with every other card discarded. The more you play, the more you will win, but keep in mind that games often end with cards of different suits on the tops of the stacks; this is the easiest way to know that you've lost., Aces Up is a simple game, so there's not much complex strategy to be applied. However, if you keep in mind the basics of the game, you're more likely to win more often. Use your empty spaces and move your aces as soon as possible.If you see a low card stacked on a higher card of the same suit, try to move the lower card to an empty space. For example, if you see a 7 of diamonds on top of a 9 of diamonds, move the 7 to an empty space and then remove it to the discard pile.
Try moving aces to empty spots. When an empty space appears and you have an ace that's free to move to it, move the ace as soon as possible.
 Aces up is a fast moving game, so each game takes only about 5-10 minutes. If your first one ends in a loss, reshuffle your cards and try again. The more practice you get, the more strategies you'll be able to develop.

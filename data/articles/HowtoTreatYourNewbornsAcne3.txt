 Baby acne is a common condition in infants. Acne presents as small red or white bumps on the baby’s face. Generally, the acne will be on the cheeks, forehead, chin, or nose. However, your baby may be afflicted by other skin conditions. If the acne is not gone within six months, it is all over the body, or is purple in color, it may not be baby acne but a more serious condition.Other skin conditions like eczema or rashes may need a doctor's care. If you suspect the bumps are not acne, seek medical advice.
 If you are concerned about your baby’s skin, you should take them to the doctor. If the bumps look worse than usual or they don’t clear up within four months, you may want to get your baby checked out by their doctor.You may want to mention the baby acne to your pediatrician when you take your baby in for a checkup.

Look for a line in port on your car stereo. It is usually marked as "Line In" or "Input."
Purchase an audio cable that can connect the headphone jack on your digital music player to the line in port on your car's stereo. The type of wire you need to get depends on the specifications of the headphone jack and line in port (audio cable connectors are usually measured as 2.5mm or 3.5mm).
Set your car stereo to play the signal it is receiving from the line in port (this can be in the same way you change the setting to any other input signal such as CD, radio or cassette).
Hear the songs that you are playing on your digital music player through your car speakers. In summary, you have simply replaced your headphones by choosing your car speakers as the output device instead while using a very similar connection method.

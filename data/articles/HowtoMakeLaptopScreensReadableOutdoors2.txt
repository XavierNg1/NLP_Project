 Either find a spot under a tree, or set up a large beach umbrella. Not only will this make your laptop screen easier to see, but it'll also keep your laptop from overheating (especially if it's black). If you'd rather keep your body in the sun, keep only the laptop in the shade, and wear a hat with a brim to keep the sun from shining right in your eyes.
 Plus, sunglasses make you look cool. When shopping for sunglasses, choose amber lenses to increase contrast and make details more clear. If given the option, upgrade to glasses that have anti-reflective coating on the front and back of the lens to effectively reduce sun glare.
 If you’re wearing a white shirt, you’ll see its reflection in the screen. Switching to a black shirt will reduce that glare more than you'd expect.
 If you’re in a pinch, try draping a piece of fabric—if you don’t have a sheet or towel, an article of clothing will do—over both your head and the laptop. While not the most ideal situation, this will almost certainly improve screen visibility in the sun.

 Follow the guidance shown in this image, focusing in particular on:

Creating a lithe and fine body structure; convey a smallish and slim size
A fine and pointed face and head
A strong but equally dainty stance.;
, Elf ears are pointed but still retain an elegance without looking odd. This may take some reshaping until you're satisfied with the end result, so use light and even pencil strokes. Follow the image for help (you can even trace over the image until you have the knack of drawing it yourself).

This is a good point to draw the eyes. The image here uses anime style eyes, which give an ethereal and cute quality at the same time. You could experiment with other eye styles as well, if preferred.
Detail her long hair; the character shown here has the hair in plaits but it can also be loose, drawn up into a bun or braided knots, etc. Whatever you choose, be sure to make it a feature of the female elf.
 Typical elf clothing fits tightly to the body and provides ease of movement for swift running, horse-riding and general movement. You may also like to define your female elf by her activities, such as being a warrior, cook, farmer, comedian, princess, etc.







A warrior elf outfit - see the additions of a belt and armor.
 These items might be jewels, a wooden spoon, a wand, a brush, a leash, or a weapon such as the sword shown here. What you choose an object should help to convey what the female elf does or represents., Green is a fairly standard color but any colors typical of forest or wood life work well, such as browns, blues, oranges, muted reds and the like.

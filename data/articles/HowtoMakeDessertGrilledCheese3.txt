 Start with your bread slices. Butter one side of each slice of bread. Set two slices of bread down, un-buttered side facing up, on a plate.Spread the brie evenly between each slice of bread. Then, divide the raspberries and chocolate evenly on each slice of bread.
Place the other two slices of bread over the tops of your sandwiches. Make sure the butter side is facing up.
 Use a large skillet heated over medium-high heat. Place the sandwiches in the skillet and then cover it.You should cook the sandwiches about 5 minutes. When they're done, they should be golden brown on each side.
 Once one side of the bread is golden brown, flip the sandwiches. Reduce the heat slightly, as you do not want the cheese to melt too much. Cook the sandwiches for about 5 more minutes, or until the other side of the bread is golden brown.Once the sandwiches are cooked, you can remove them from the heat, let them cool, and enjoy.

 Even if you have no idea whatsoever on the subject she enjoys, ask her about it. She'll like talking about her favorite topic.;
, For example, teach her how to drive, or take her to a shooting club. The options are numerous.
 This doesn't mean you actually have to buy something outrageous just because she likes it. As a matter of fact, supplicating to her opinion would have the opposite effect. While you're there, make her try some sexy clothes. Girls love to dress up, even if they don't buy anything.
 Get her listening to your favorite music, or see your favorite movie.
 Don't explain where you're taking her, just tell her to trust you.
 Invite her to your place and have her help you cook a dinner.
 Ask her personal questions, and don't be embarrassed to talk about yourself. Make it a pleasant conversation. See the tips section for ideas.
 Girls are smart enough to handle their own lives. Ask her to share what's bothering her, don't ask what can you do to help her. Whereas the former makes you the empathetic person she'd fall for, the latter makes you the patronizing jerk who thinks a girl is too weak or stupid to solve her problems.
 Also, don't overdo it. A joke and an implication that you really want to be with her (and "implication" does not mean saying "I wanna f*** you" outright!) is OK, but if all you can say is sex-related jokes you look needy and horny.
 This is actually a therapeutic approach used by psychologists. After she's all cried out, she'll start to like you because you made her feel good (it's counterintuitive, but going through the sorrow instead of suppressing it is a great relief on the mind).

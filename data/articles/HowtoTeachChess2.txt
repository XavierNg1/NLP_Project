 Start with the pawns, excluding the rules for en passant, then explain each of the pieces on the back row, starting with the king, rooks, bishops, queens, and finally the knights. Ignore explaining castling for the time being. Tell them there are only two pieces that move oddly, the pawns and the knights.;
, The student can do so either verbally or by moving the pieces. If they do so incorrectly, correct them, then start the test over.
 The students will pass the first lesson if they place the queen on the same color square. If they have correctly shown the movement of all pieces move onto lesson two, advanced movement.
 A pawn game is a chess game with the pawns only on the 2nd and 7th ranks. The object of the game is to promote a pawn, i.e. reach the first/last rank. These games are very helpful in learning how pawns move, developing the idea of a pawn structure, and understanding how pawns would interact in a real game.
 The object of a pawn mower is to have a single piece (the easiest is rook, then bishop, queen, and finally knight) capture all the pawns. The number of moves allowed is the number of pawns that are set. This will help the student learn how the pieces move, and learn basic tactics in the process.

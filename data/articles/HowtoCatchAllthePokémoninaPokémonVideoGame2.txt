 These are frequently more common and you can train them to gain experience (XP) and level up. Many Pokémon evolve after reaching a certain level, which means you may not need to catch a high-level form.


Your pokédex will still register the previous evolution as "caught."

, Some Pokémon, usually the high-level ones, can only be obtained through evolution. Pokémon like Charizard and Blastoise are extremely rare in the wild.


To increase the level of a Pokémon, battle other trainers or wild Pokémon. Winning battles lets your Pokémon gain experience points (XP), which raises its level.
 Some Pokémon will not evolve by simply raising its level. Pokémon like Pikachu and Clefairy will only grow if you use evolution-inducing items called “Evolution Stones” on them.Choose the Pokémon you use the stone on wisely – some evolution stones can be expensive.
These kinds of items are available throughout the game and most can be acquired through completing the game’s storyline.
 Select the item from your inventory. You’ll be asked to choose which Pokémon you want to use the stones on. After you pick the Pokémon, the evolution process will begin, changing your Pokémon into its adult form.

Stay calm and react mindfully. , Pick your battles. Don’t let minor annoyances with the teacher get angry responses out of you. Things like a rude tone of voice can be hurtful, but might not be worth escalating into a bigger issue. , Teachers are just people. They may be having a bad day or dealing with particularly difficult person problems. Ask yourself what might be going on in the teacher's life that would cause them to act this way.

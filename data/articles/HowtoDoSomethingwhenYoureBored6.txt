 Okay, so you can't agree on anything. Pick one thing you want to do and combine it with something your friend wants to do. Say you want to watch a movie and your friend wants to bake a cake. Bake a red carpet cake with edible movie decorations (if you're a really skilled cake baker) and then watch a movie about cakes. Maybe that's a bad example, but you get the idea.
 Maybe there's something in your favorite song that will inspire you. This may seem like an odd idea, but try it! Try a song that describes something familiar to you, and work from there

, This can turn into a calorie-laden habit, but cook something with your friend. Then, work off the extra calories in a workout. Eating when you're bored isn't a bad habit if you work it off, especially if you eat healthy food. But if you're going to exercise, make sure to hydrate properly before, and you can turn the exercise into a game! Bike-race your friend, or just run and race your friend.
 Don't get carried away here. If you're in a crowded place, this is perfect. Dare your friend to go up to a stranger and ask if he or she would like your leftover lemonade, for example. If you're at school, a perfect way to make lunch more interesting is to dare a couple friends to sit at a different table, with a few or their enemies or the opposite gender, and act natural about it.
 First pick a good song, then pick your moves and last, create your costume. Then pick a date to perform your dance routine and practice it daily!

To locate a razor clam, while slowly walking along tap the ground in front of you with your shovel blade, clam gun or simply stomp your feet, the vibration will cause the clam to dig itself deeper to escape an assumed threat. As the clam retreats the suction causes a hole or depression to appear on the surface of the sand, this is called a clam show. Depending on the depth of the clam, the water content of the sand, and other factors, show can manifest itself in different ways. These are typically known as a dimple, a doughnut, or a keyhole clam show.



Dimple; a depression with distinct edges and a bottom but no other deformations of the sand.

 Stick with sandals, pumps, and thin heels the next time you wear a breezy sundress or venture out in a sleeveless blouse and capri pants. Heavy shoes, like boots and platform heels, often look clunky and out of proportion when paired with lighter fabrics and airy styles.
 Slip on a pair of boots or a thick heel with your warm winter sweaters and tweed jackets. If both the material and structure of a garment look heavy, a thick, solid shoe will compliment that garment better than a notably thin, tiny shoe would.
 Shoes come with a variety of textures, patterns, and embellishments. A quick way to add a little visual interest to a plain outfit is by finding a shoe with a little extra pizzazz to act as a focal point. A leopard print flat can add a wild twist to a plain jeans and tank top combination, and a wedge heel with a ruffled front can give an air of playfulness to a simple sundress.
 If your outfit already includes a busy pattern, like polka dots or paisley print, do not wear shoes that will compete with it. Instead, opt for a shoe in a solid color and gravitate toward styles without extra embellishments.
 A little matching looks coordinated and well put together, but too much can quickly become overkill. For example, a blue pump coordinates nicely with a blue purse, but you should resist the urge to add on a blue belt, heavy blue jewelry, and a blue hat. Similarly, you can wear rose post earrings if your shoes have a rose embellishment on them, but you may want to think twice about adding a purse, hat, and large ring with the same rose decoration.
 If your outfit already shows a considerable amount of skin, you may want to tone the shoe down and opt for something moderately sultry instead of something overtly so. You might be pushing it if you wear three-inch strappy stilettos with a strapless mini-dress, but the same mini-dress can look appropriately sexy with a half-inch peep-toe.

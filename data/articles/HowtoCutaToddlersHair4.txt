 It’s possible to cut a toddler’s hair with clippers, especially in the case of shorter hair.Buy a clipper set at a drug or department store. They should run you around $20. You can use the clipper guard.Put the plastic Number 3 guard on the clipper. Plug it in. Hold the clippers at about a 90- degree angle. Clip straight up from the base of the beck.
Cut upwards with the clippers, and do so all around the toddler’s head.
 Once you are done cutting the back and sides of the toddler’s hair, you will want to fine tune the cut.


Remove the guard from the clippers, and clean up the hair around the toddler’s ears. Go slowly so you don’t cut the child.
Use the clippers to clean up and shape the cut’s style around the nape of the toddler’s neck. Again, go slowly so you don’t nick the child.
It’s very important that you proceed with great caution, making sure to distract the child and go very slowly, anticipating the possibility of sudden movements.
 After using clippers, you should use scissors to complete the toddler’s haircut. Don’t use clippers to cut the top or front of a toddler’s hair.


Start at the top of the hair by taking a section in the front. Decide the length you want. Hold your fingers across the section. Cut the hair away. Work your way to the back.
Use the first cut as a guide cut. Cut the entire middle section and then cut the sides. Consider the hair as having three sections on top, the sides of the hair and the middle section.
Work toward the back of the middle section. Blend the top of the hair with the sides. Cut at a 45-degree angle. Hold a section of the hair in your fingers, and cut at this angle. Then take another small section and do the same, working your way around the head.

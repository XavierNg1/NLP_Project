 Many singers tend to tilt their heads up when they sing high notes and down when they sing low notes. These tense movements can strain your voice and even limit your range. Instead, always try to keep your throat and neck muscles relaxed when you sing.You may find that your voice cracks when you’re nervous. This is because your muscles are tense when you’re nervous.
 Many experience cracking because they’re singing from their throat instead of their diaphragm. Use your larger abdominal muscles when you sing, and don’t rely on the smaller ones in your throat. This will allow you to have more support while you sing and transition more freely between registers.


Train yourself to do this by practicing low breathing. To do this properly, expand your belly like a balloon when you take deep breaths., Vocal registers are different ways of producing sound. When you sing, your vocal folds look and vibrate differently when in different registers. Because of this, it’s hard to transition smoothly from one to another without cracking. Avoid cracking by training yourself to blend these registers.Head voice (the higher, lighter, sweeter register) and chest voice (the deeper, lower, more powerful register) are the more common vocal registers.
Beginners naturally sing lower notes in chest voice and higher notes in head voice. Practice singing lower notes in head voice and higher notes in chest voice to help ease the transition.

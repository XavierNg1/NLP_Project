 Place the venison roast in your slow cooker. Pour 2 cups (500 ml) of beef broth over it evenly.


If you do not have beef broth, you could use venison stock, beef stock, chicken stock, or vegetable broth. In a pinch, you could even use water.;
, Cut the butter into small chunks and distribute it evenly over the surface of the roast.


If the butter has been softened, smear it over the top and sides of the meat. If the butter is still hard, however, simply distribute the chunks of butter over the surface as evenly as possible to distribute the flavor.
 Combine the garlic, salt, pepper, paprika, thyme, and rosemary in a small bowl. Sprinkle this blend of spices and herbs evenly over the top and sides of the roast.


If you want the seasonings to penetrate the meat even further, consider using your hands to rub the seasoning blend into the meat. This works best if you are also using softened butter since you can spread both the butter and the seasonings over the surface at the same time.
 Spread the diced onion over the top of the roast. Layer the cubed potatoes and chopped carrots on top, as well.


Even if you choose not to prepare the roast with vegetables, you should still add the onion. Many people claim that the pungent onion flavor masks the "gamey" taste of a deer roast.
If you prefer crisp, firm vegetables, you can wait until the final 2 hours of cooking time before adding the cubed potatoes and chopped carrots. The onion should always be added at this time, however.
 A thawed roast should take about 8 hours, but a frozen or partially frozen roast will need a full 10 hours.


Alternatively, you could switch the slow cooker on high and leave it for 6 hours.
 Once the roast has finished cooking, remove it from the slow cooker and carve it into portion-sized chunks. Serve the potatoes and carrots on the side.

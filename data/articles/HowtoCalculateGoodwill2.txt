 For this method, you will need to understand what your average profits from previous years are. Add together the profits of previous years, and divide by the total number of years.

For example, you may have earned $200,000 in 2010, $220,000 in 2011, $190,000 in 2012, and $210,000 in 2013. Add these all up to get $820,000 and divide by four years. You will get $205,000, which is the average profit.
 Super profits are the profits earned above the average profits. To learn what your super profits are, take this year's actual profits and subtract your average profits from them. For example, let's say the average profit for your business is $200,000. In one year you earned a net profit of $230,000. The excess of profits earned over the average profits — the super profit — is $30,000.
 For calculating goodwill, the total super profits of a given number of years are multiplied by the agreed number of years of purchase. Put another way — Goodwill = Super Profits X Number of Years.”, An example is provided to demonstrate how the super profits formula is applied.


Let's say average profits had been $200,000, but the actual actual profits in a four year span were: 2010: $210,000; 2011: $230,000; 2012: $210,000; 2013: $200,000.
The super profits for each year are calculated by subtracting the average profit from the actual profit. For 2010, the super profit is 10,000; for 2011 it is 30,000, etc.
The yearly super profits are then added together. For this example, you end up with $10,000 + $30,000 + $10,000 + 0 = $50,000.
Finally, the total super profit is multiplied by the number of years. In this case, Goodwill = $50,000 X 4 or $200,000.
 In this case, Goodwill would be reflective of a company/s ability to earn more than its average profits. By adding the super profits to the fair market value of the business, your purchase price reflects a company's earnings power.

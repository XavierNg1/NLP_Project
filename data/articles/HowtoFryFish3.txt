 Pour the oil into a shallow frying pan or cast iron skillet. Let the oil heat for 3 or 4 minutes. Test to make sure its ready to fry by dropping a bit of green onion in the pan. If it immediately starts to sizzle, the oil is ready for the fish.
 Use tongs to transfer the pieces from the bowl to the pan. Spread them in an even layer across the surface of the pan, making sure not to layer pieces on top of each other.









Fry the pieces on the first side until they turn golden brown.
Use the tongs to turn the pieces over and fry the other side.
 Remove one piece from the pan and set it on a clean cutting board. Slice the fish in half with a knife. If it's opaque and falling apart, it is ready to eat. If it is rubbery and translucent, place it back in the pan and let the fish cook for another 2 minutes.
 Use the tongs to remove the pieces from the pan and set them on a plate covered with a paper towel to drain.









Handle the fish pieces gently, since they fall apart easily after they're cooked.
If you wish, fry green onions, pepper, chilis, and other vegetables in the hot oil before you remove it from heat.

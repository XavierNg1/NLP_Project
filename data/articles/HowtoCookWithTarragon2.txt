 Just because it's dry doesn't mean it can't go bad! Be sure to check the expiration date on dried tarragon you purchase.
 If you have excess fresh tarragon or don't want to buy already dry tarragon, consider drying your own:


Cut young but mature stems off a tarragon plant with garden snips.
Cut in the morning after the dew has dried.
Band several stems of tarragon together with rubber bands.
Hang bundles in a dry, warm place to dry.
Carefully remove dried tarragon stems when they are crispy to the touch.
Crumble the leaves and stems to fine pieces.
 Store dried tarragon in a cool, dark place in a tightly closed container.

 This encourages quicker water intake for flowers that have been cut.


Add Cut Flower Food. Flower food provides nourishment and a bactericide so the flowers can stay healthy. If you don't have flower food, use a little sugar, a few drops of lemon juice, and a couple drops of bleach to the warm water.;
, If you leave them, they'll start to foul the water and your flowers will die sooner.
 This will increase in the amount of water your flowers consume, increasing the flower's lifespan.
 Flowers are alive and they need to breathe. If your vase is too crowded, either use a larger vase or move some of the flowers to a different vase.
 Replace the water every day to keep your flowers fresh. Make sure any debris or wet leaves are removed from the vase before adding fresh water.


Be sure the ends on all stems and in the water. Pay attention to the flowers with shorter stems.
 Trim the stems every every couple of days when you're changing the water. Use something sharp to cut the stems at a 45ยบ angle. An angled cut increases the surface area the flower can use to absorb water.
 A florist may use floral foam to hold your flowers in place. Simply pour water on the foam (never the flowers) or let the foam soak in a basin of water.
 This will insure your flowers have all what they need to thrive.
 While esthetics matter, you need to keep your flowers in the best possible environment to keep them longer.


Keep cut flowers away from direct sun and other sources of heat.
Avoid placing them near fruit, which releases ethylene gas that will speed up the maturation process and cause wilting.
Drafts and breezes, even cool ones, can reduce the flowers' lifespan by encouraging evaporation from the petals and leaves.
 Cut off all wilting flowers whenever you notice them so they don't shorten the life of your flowers. Wilting flowers release ethylene gas which will encourage your fresh flowers to speed up their life cycle and wilt prematurely.

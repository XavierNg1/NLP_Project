 For example, national parks will charge you by the car, not per person. The Smithsonian museums in Washington, D.C. are free of charge.


Get advice from other families. Talk to people you know, or read travel blogs online to find out where others have taken great vacations that did not require a huge budget.
Think outside the country. Traveling to other countries that have a great currency exchange rate might help you get more for your money. For example, Costa Rica and Thailand might be expensive to get to, but once you are there your costs will be minimal.;
, For example, if you visit a city such as San Francisco or New York, you will not have to rent a car once you arrive.


Take advantage of public transportation, rent bikes and pack good walking shoes to ensure you can get around on foot.
 Airfare for you and your children might add up quickly, but do the math to make sure gas will not cost even more.


Look for discounted airfares. Flying from city to city can often be less expensive than driving, depending on the airline and the destination. For example, you can sometimes fly from Miami to Las Vegas on Southwest Air for as little as $99 each way.
Stay close to home if you want to drive. For example, if you live in Los Angeles you can plan a trip by car to the Grand Canyon. If you live in Atlanta, you might consider a trip with your kids to one of the Florida beaches.



Head to Colorado in the summer rather than the ski season, for example. Or visit New England in the spring instead of the autumn. Take a chance on a cruise during hurricane season, or book a trip to Iceland in February.

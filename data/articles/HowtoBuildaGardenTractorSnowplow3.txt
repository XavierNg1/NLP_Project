 On most models of tractor you’ll need to make a bracket on the frame and bring that forward slightly in order to position the plowing blade at the front.


You can use reclaimed steel joists, or something like metal trusses, as these are adaptable and usually strong enough for the purpose. A welding tool is likely to be useful in attaching the bracket to the vehicle’s frame.
Try to remove the motor deck and cutting tool before doing this, both for safety reasons and ease of access.
 You now need to attach the plough bucket or blade to the frame using a welding tool. Try to incorporate a pin or lever to allow the plough bucket to manoeuvre side to side. Add a hand-operated lever to the bucket so it can be pushed to manoeuvre it while you are sitting on the tractor.


If you are left-handed, consider doing this on the left-hand side.
 If you want to incorporate a lift mechanism, you may need to modify the frame slightly to allow for this. You’ll probably need to create a hand or foot lever so the bucket can be lifted by the person riding the mower.
 Special garden equipment snow chains are available. Check the tire to see what the wheel size it (it should be written on the tire).


Your local garden store may carry these, or you can purchase them online.
 Start fitting your snow chains by laying the chain out on the ground by the side of the tractor wheel. Remove any tangles and check for any damage. Drape the chain over the wheel. You’ll then need to move the tractor forward a few inches to wrap the chain around the tire.


Finally, clip the chain into place and do up the rest of the fittings so it is securely fastened around the tire and tight enough to grip the snow as required.
 For stability, consider adding some weight onto the back end of your tractor to balance out the new weight at the front added by the snowplow blade. To do this:


Strap bricks to the back of the tractor. Wheel weights may also help stabilize and balance your tractor.

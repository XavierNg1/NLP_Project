 Voobly is a third-party game hosting website that allows you to play multiplayer versions of several games through their ‘game lobbies’. To start, open up www.voobly.com in your browser.;
, There is a button on the right side of the website that says ‘download voobly client’. Doing this will allow you to use the website for your multiplayer game. If a dialogue box opens prompting you to ‘run’ the file, click ‘run’.
 You’ll next be prompted to create your username and password. Do so using a new username and password unique to the website and different from any you might use on other websites, since it may not be secured.
 Before you can begin playing the game, you’ll next have to download the lobby client. This is the same process as downloading the voobly client - you’ll be supplied with the download link, which you click ‘run’ to allow.
 Although you may have just downloaded the voobly client for the first time, the website may still prompt you to update it. Click the link to update the client, and allow it to run through completion.
 When the download is complete, click the link to enter the game lobby. Here, there will be a list of all the available games you can play, including all the versions of Age of Empires. Click the link for the game in order to be taken to its individual lobby.
 Once you are in the lobby for your specific game, you have the opportunity to either create a multiplayer game, or to join an existing game. All the options are listed near the top of the lobby, with the open multiplayer games shown below that.

 You can travel from Illinois to Missouri via MetroBus routes. The system's stops include many of the city's major attractions, like the civic center, Laclede's Landing and Busch Stadium.


Use the MetroBus schedule to help find the best route to your destination before purchasing your tickets. Some routes may be quickest and less expensive if you combine a ride on the MetroBus with the MetroLink.
 If you'll be using both MetroLink and MetroBus, consider buying a combo fare pass at the store to save money.

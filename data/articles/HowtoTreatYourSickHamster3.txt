 This will help you get to know what is normal for your hamster. Check him at least twice a day and get used to how much he eats every day, how much he drinks, how active he is and when he most likes to play. By knowing this, it helps you spot when things aren't right, such as his appetite has dropped off or he's drinking more than he did.


Knowing these small details will help you spot any possible sickness early in your hamster if it manifests in his daily routine.
 Stress puts a strain on the immune system, which makes your hamster less able to fight off infection and get himself well again.Stress to a hamster includes feeling threatened or unsafe, so make sure the family cat or dog can't sit staring at him for hours on end. Consider covering half of the cage with a towel so the hamster has privacy and can retreat to a safe area if he needs to.


Avoid loud noises, which can also frighten your hamster. Avoid anything in the air that could put a stress on its respiratory system, such as tobacco smoke or spray air fresheners.
 The ideal room temperature for a hamster is between 68 to 72 degrees. If it is very hot, the hamster can suffer from heat stress, so make sure there is a fan blowing near the cage in order to circulate air and cool him off. Very low temperatures below 50 degrees, especially for more than 24 hours, can trigger the hamster to go into hibernation. This makes them go to sleep and they are not able to wake up when you stimulate them, so it can appear the hamster is dead.


If you suspect this is the case, put the hamster in a hamster safe box, such as his carry case, and pop him in the airing cupboard for a few days. Hamster that went into a state of hibernation will wake with this method.

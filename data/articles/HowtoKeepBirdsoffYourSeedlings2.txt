 Birds are scared of humans, but since you can’t stand in your garden full time, construct a scarecrow to guard your garden on your behalf. To create your scarecrow, tie two sticks together with string to create a cross. Dress your scarecrow in old clothes and stuff him with hay or straw to give him a shape. You can create a face for your scarecrow by drawing on an old burlap bag and attaching the bag to the stick using your string. Mount your scarecrow in your garden to keep the birds away.If you don’t want to build a scarecrow, scary masks or owl silhouettes also work. The goal is to frighten the birds, so be creative.Move your scarecrow around your garden occasionally, so the birds don’t get suspicious.
 Birds are scared of their own reflections, so hanging reflective surfaces around your garden can be a great way of keeping them away. Hang CDs or DVDs at intervals around your seedlings; you can attach them to a clothesline or to stakes planted throughout your garden.Mirrors or any other reflective material can also work for this method.
 Garden centers and online retailers sell balloons with scary faces on them to terrify birds. You can easily make your own version of these using Mylar balloons. Use permanent, non-washable markers to draw scary faces on your balloons. Secure them to posts around your garden using ribbon or tape.Make sure to move your balloons around every couple of days to keep the birds on their toes.

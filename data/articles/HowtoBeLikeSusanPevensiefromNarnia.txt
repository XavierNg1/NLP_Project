 The Pevensies live in London - Finchley to be exact - so they speak with an English accent. Susan sounds very posh when she talks, so speak clearly and don't use slang.;
, The Chronicles of Narnia are set in the 1940s, during the Second World War, so the characters dress really old-fashionably. Wear plaid skirts with blouses and cardigans, and knee-high or ankle socks with lace-up shoes to give off that 1941 feel.
 Susan is incredibly intelligent, and can often be found with her head in a book. It doesn't have to be a boring book - make sure you like it.
 As mentioned, Susan is incredibly intelligent, and does very well in school. So, study hard for tests and exams, complete homework on time and pay attention during class.
 Throughout The Chronicles of Narnia, Susan is seen as the voice of logic and common sense. Keep calm in the face of a crisis, and think of the best solution to solve it. Be quick-witted and alert, and always trust your instinct. Susan is very down-to-earth and finds it hard to believe in the impossible. She is the most surprised to find out that Narnia exists.
 (If you have one, of course). Susan and her sister Lucy are very close, and she is very protective of her. Give your sister at least one hug every day, and depending on what age she is, do fun stuff together - go to the mall, give her a makeover etc.
 Susan fights during the battle scenes in the movies, not only shooting arrows, but spinning them too, and using her bow as a shield and knocking Telmarine soldiers out of the way with it.
 All the Pevensies and most of the other characters in Narnia can horse ride, so if you're not already doing so, sign up for horse riding classes.
 She doesn't have the title High Queen Susan The Gentle for nothing. Treat others like you would like to be treated, and never, EVER be the one to start a fight. However, if you disagree with something, state your point calmly but also try to see the other person's point of view.

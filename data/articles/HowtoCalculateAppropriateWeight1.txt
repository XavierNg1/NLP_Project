 Many can be found online and most are trustworthy -- it's a simple mathematical equation that is the same across all boards. However, for a more reputable source, the BMI calculator or chart can be found at the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services website or at your local physician's office.;
, Most calculators have options for both standard and metric measurements. You'll also need to report your gender into the BMI calculator for more accurate results.


You can do it manually, if you so choose. For standard measurements:

Take your height in inches and square it. If you are 70 inches (177.8 cm) tall, take 70 x 70.
Take your weight divided by that number. If you are 150 pounds, that's 150/4900. That's .0306.
Then, take that number and times it by 703. There's your BMI. For this instance, that's 21.6.


For metric measurements:

Square your height. If you are 1.77 meters (5.8 ft) tall, that's 1.77 x 1.77. In other words, 3.13.
Divide your weight by that number. If you're 68 kilograms, that 68 divided by 3.13, or 21.6. Your BMI.
 There are four categories: underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese. Remember, these are general guidelines.


You are underweight if the index results are under 18.5.
You are at your target weight if you the index results are between 18.5 and 24.9.
You are considered overweight if your index results are between 25 and 29.9.
You are considered obese if you have a BMI of 30 or greater.

Your risk for certain diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and certain cancers increases with your BMI.

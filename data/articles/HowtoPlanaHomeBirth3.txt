 Whether you plan to give birth on your bed or in your bathtub, you will want to set up well in advance. Make sure that everything you will need is in the room and stored in an easily accessible location.


Find an ideal tub for a water birth. You can use your own bathtub or purchase a blowup pool or birthing tub. Warm water is best to help you relax during birth.Be sure to have some extra towels handy as you will likely be in and out of the water.Prepare a protective covering for your bed or carpeted area. You can a purchase plastic covering or use old sheets.
 Purchase candles, relaxing music, or whatever sensory equipment will help you feel calm. Set them up in your birthing area prior to your due date.


The use of lighting and soft music helps many women relax during labor. Ask your doula about any other pain management techniques.
 You never know how long the process will be, so it will help to have food available. Shop for appropriate food and snacks for before, during, and after labor.Healthy snacks like crackers, granola bars, fruit, and nuts are good options for you and any others attending the birth.
 In the event of an emergency, you'll need to rush to a nearby hospital. Have your identification and health insurance cards ready. You'll also need to pack personal toiletries, baby clothes, and an extra change of clothes for yourself.

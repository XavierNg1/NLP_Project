 Because pregnancy requires new dietary habits, consult a nutritionist before dramatically altering your diet. Dietitians should also be able to help you tailor your prenatal diet to include adequate nutrition and extra foods that can help reduce your symptoms of depression.
 Whole grains and complex carbohydrates help supply your brain with the energy it needs to use the other resources your diet provides. With insufficient carbohydrates, your brain can quickly run out of energy, leaving you feeling mentally fatigued, exhausted physically, and distracted.
 Omega-3 fatty acids, such as those found in fish, nuts, and olive oil, are essential for the gray matter in your brain and effective communication among your brain cells. Getting plenty of these healthy fats may improve your memory, alertness, reduce inflammation and fatigue, and stimulate the release of feel-good hormones in your brain.
 The vitamins and minerals found in prenatal vitamins are not just essential for the development of your baby, they are also vital to the healthy functioning of your brain.


Prenatal vitamins contain antioxidants and other nutrients that improve brain functioning by protecting cells from damaging free radicals, stimulating the release of mood-affecting hormones, and enabling the repair and formation of healthy brain tissue. Certain minerals promote restful sleep and boost energy levels as well.
 Amino acids like tryptophan and phenylalanine are naturally found in many lean proteins like chicken and turkey. Amino acids and protein help your brain produce hormones that regulate your mood, increase motivation, reduce fatigue, and promote alertness.

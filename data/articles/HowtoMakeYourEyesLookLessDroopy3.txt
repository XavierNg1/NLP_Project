 Use an eyelash curler for this. Clamp your lashes at the base, holding it for five seconds. Then, release your curler and move it down to the middle of your lashes. Clamp and hold again. Release, and do this one more time at the tips of your lashes. This will give your lashes a big curl, which will also make your eyes look bigger and more open., Place your wand at the base of your lashes, slowly wiggling the wand towards the ends. The wiggling helps to coat the lashes fully, while also preventing any clumps. Apply one coat to your lashes and allow it to dry. Then, apply a second coat to your outer lashes. This will create a winged effect that will help to open your eyes even more.
 This step is completely optional, but you can add fake eyelashes if you have sparse eyelashes, or simply want even more volume. For droopy eyes, itâ€™s best to apply the false lashes only on the outer corners. You can buy special eyelashes for this, or you can simply trim regular lashes.

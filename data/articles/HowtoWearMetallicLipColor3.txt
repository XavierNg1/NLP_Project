 You want your lipstick to match your clothing to some degree. The match does not have to be perfect, but something about your clothing items should match your lipstick.The simplest way to do this is to match your lipstick with your main outfit. For example, if you're wearing a red dress, opt for red metallic lips.
However, you can also choose to highlight a complimentary color in your outfit. For example, if you're wearing a black dress with pink stripes, pair this with pink lipstick. If you have an accessory of a particular color, like an orange necklace, go for orange lipstick.
 Bolder metallic lips may pair better with a more feminine dress. Bold, dark red lips, for example, can be paired well with a classic black dress. If you opted for very bold metallic lips, choose a very feminine dress to match., Pinker shades often match well with floral patterns. Rose gold metallic lips, for example, may go great with a floral-patterned blouse or top.Be aware of colors as well. Try to, for example, match the pink roses in your dress with the color of your lipstick.

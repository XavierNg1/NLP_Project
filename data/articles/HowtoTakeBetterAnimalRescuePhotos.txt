 It's called 'spray and pray'. Shooting at the subject with no real intent and hoping it comes out ok...or thereabouts.
 Especially if the goal is adoption, choose or create a photo to show what a wonderful animal it is. If it's an active dog, show it moving. If it's a particularly beautiful cat, groom it and take a close-up portrait. If there was abuse or neglect in the animal's past, and you can tastefully show a before-and-after of its recovery, do so.
 With a video, you increase your odds of a good story and good photographs.

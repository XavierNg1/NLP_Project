 Launch GTA through the Start menu or by double-clicking the game’s shortcut icon on the desktop, if it’s there.
 Once you have launched the game, it will take you to the menu screen. Select either “Start game” or “Load game” to continue. When you have successfully launched the game, you will see your avatar standing in the virtual world ready to play.
 Press the ESC key and enter the map menu by pressing enter. When in the map, look for the nearest AMMU-NATION, the gun icon on the map.
 This can be done by right-clicking on the icon, and a green line will appear showing you your route.


Exit the map by pressing ESC, and your GPS should be updated now on the bottom left of the screen.
 Follow the GPS marker by walking or driving to the store.
 Once you arrive at the store, you can enter by simply walking through the front door. As you walk around the room, you will notice various guns located around the room. When you have found the gun you want ammo for, walk up to it and a small black box should appear in the left-hand corner with prices.


To buy the ammo, simply press ENTER. Depending on the type of gun, pressing ENTER buys a fixed number of rounds each time, e.g., 60 rounds for most rifles.
You can walk away at any time when you have finished your purchase.

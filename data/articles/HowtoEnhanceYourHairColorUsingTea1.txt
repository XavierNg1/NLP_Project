In addition to golden tones, calendula also has soothing and antibacterial properties for the scalp., Cut up a half cup of fresh rhubarb root or use 3 or 4 tablespoons (44.4 or 59.1 ml) of dried rhubarb root and add to a pot with a quart of water. Simmer for 20 minutes and let steep overnight. Strain out the pieces and use the remaining liquid in a spray or rinse on your hair.Avoid inhaling the steam created from simmering the root over heat, as rhubarb roots and leaves contain a high quantity of oxalic acid, which is toxic to ingest but makes the lightening effect last longer.This treatment will also help mask gray hairs.

Tap within the circle on the chart to select the plot area and do menu item Chart Add Data. Select cell range G5:H13 in response to the Query Box that arises. Do not be alarmed if the results are wrong. There may be two lines, one of which is extra. Find, by tapping on each series plot, between the two the one which ends with ...$H$5:$H$13,2) because that's the one you want and the other one is to be deleted. Correct in the formula bar the beginning of the series to $G$5:$G$13 from the C's or whatever it was in error. The line should plot now at about the 3 PM position in approximately a straight line with a bend at the end. Do Format Series and select the Line width to be 1 or .75 (at most 2), the Glow to be 2 and 50% and choose the color gradients of blues or browns or whites at the tips -- whatever your model picture shows in that position, OK;

, This will cue you as to the row number to use in the top section, e.g. in I2:J3 -- (the 3 was used to keep track of numbers of lines plus glow lines already added previously)(in truth, however, often a line thickness of .75 or 1.75 was used simply because 3.75 was the default, and 1 + 2 glow lines had not been figured out yet until it was seen that the center pupil was not coming out as a near-perfect circle at all, due to such variations as line thickness and glow variances -- much re-tracing of steps was done; an error which you hopefully needn't repeat);

, Keep doubling in this way until you reach 128 and stop and trim off until the total number of data series, including 2, is 240 columns (120 series of x's and y's).
Do Edit Replace routine per row 15, without any errors, for rows 2 and 3 -- for example, if in Row 15 column G, there is a 5, then replace the common row number in cell range G2:H3 with 5, Replace All, OK; do that for every single series, all the way across!
Construct the chart carefully by selecting the cell range to chart of G5:H13, or I5:J13 for the next series, etc, all the way across, and patiently as per the above step(s); it was found that 30 data points took about 2 hours to do, so the whole chart took 8 hours over 2 days to complete, prior to error cleanup; here is an example of a gradient as you must set the line width and gradient by clicking on the series plot each time you chart a series, all the way across! Remember line width should be .75 to 2 and the gradient and glow size and transparency percentage are set individually per iris fiber in accordance with your individual pupil photo you're copying, but generally should remain constant or the pupil will not come out a nearly perfect circle. The Modifier formula also bears on the situation, so keep that difference pretty tiny, like 1.007 vs. .993, for a total difference of .014, or less. Generally speaking, this author thinks a change of .005 is visible, but is not sure exactly. Visual acuity varies between individuals. On the other hand, Excel has set the minimum line weight at .25, which is definitely thicker than their glow or transparent objects. The situation pictured below, of an imperfect circle, was corrected by keeping glow size to 2 and transparency to 50%, constantly. Otherwise, it is a Gradient Example.





Here is an example of a data chit reconciliation for columns A:D -- just making sure everything was on track;

, Make it semi-transparent, and change the color to White (and it's best to start with a white object in this author's opinion); place it on the main chart;

 Fireflies live in various habitats, including forests and rivers. They tend to be drawn to high grass and humid, damp areas. They are found all over the world, from the Americas to Europe and Asia. In the United States, fireflies are rarely found west of the Rocky Mountains. They are commonly found down south, in the Midwest, and on the East Coast., Warm summer evenings are often the best time to catch fireflies â€“ typically between June and September. Fireflies tend to come out at dusk when it is still warm out. Most fireflies are typically found in the country or in the suburbs.


As the night gets later, the air tends to cool off and some fireflies will stop flashing., Since fireflies communicate using their light, you can sometimes attract them by using a flashlight of your own. Pay attention to the light patterns that the fireflies are emitting, and copy them by switching your flashlight on and off.


Consider placing a blue piece of paper over your flashlight to turn the light blue. Scientists have found that fireflies respond better to blue light than regular lights., Since they rely on their light patterns for mating, fireflies are more attracted to darkness. Turn off your outdoor lighting, such as porch lights and walkway lights, to draw in more fireflies., Like most animals and insects, fireflies are easily scared by loud noises and sudden movements. When catching fireflies, make sure to move slowly and quietly. The more relaxed you are, the more relaxed the fireflies will be around you.

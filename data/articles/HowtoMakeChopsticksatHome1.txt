 You can get dowel rods at many craft stores, hardware stores, and baking stores. You will want wood dowel rods that are about a quarter inch thick. You might want to get many so you have backups in case you mess up while you are learning. If you are planning on making multiple chopsticks, you might want to buy as many as 20 dowel rods, but it is up to you.;
, You will probably want your chopsticks to be around 10 inches in length. However, you may want to feel different sizes of chopsticks to see what length works best for your hands.You can cut your dowel rods with sharp shears or a small saw.Make sure to use a sharp object to cut the rods, that you use a cutting board, that you keep your fingers away from any blade, and that you have a firm grip on the rod so it does not slip when you cut it.
 Use a blade to shave off pieces of the wood at an angle. Start about half way through the chopstick and keep shaving down to the end of the chopsticks. You want both chopsticks to come to a point about a half inch in diameter.


Cut away from you with the knife, not toward you.
 Make sure there are no splinters or rough edges on your chopsticks. File them with a sanding block to smooth them out.

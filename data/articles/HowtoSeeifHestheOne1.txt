 He should make you feel like a superhero. You should feel like you can be anybody and do anything when you're with him. You should be unafraid of the challenges in your life because he makes you confident that you are strong enough to get through them. When you're with him, you should feel like you can take on the world and win.;

 Do you feel the need to hide things around him? If you feel that you need to hide things about yourself or your life, then maybe he's not the one. He should love you no matter what, and if you worry that he'd judge your slightly-hairy wintertime legs, then maybe he isn't the one.

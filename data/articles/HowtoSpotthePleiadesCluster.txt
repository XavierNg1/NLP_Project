 The cluster itself is actually very bright, but is far away from Earth, and therefore, difficult to spot with the naked eye. First thing, know where to look in the sky. The cluster is generally somewhere between the moon and the Orion constellation. Locate the moon, (shouldn't be too hard), and then locate Orion.;
, If the moon is visible but Orion is not, look to the west of the moon.
 If there is any light pollution at all then the cluster will be extremely difficult to find.
 You should be looking high into the sky.
, If you look closer, you can even make out the individual stars, an may even notice the dipper shaped pattern they make.
, You have just spotted the Pleiades star cluster.

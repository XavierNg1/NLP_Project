 Waist circumference is a measure that indicates your risk for obesity, metabolic syndrome and other chronic health conditions.High waist circumference numbers may indicate an increased amount of visceral fat present.To minimize risk, women's waist circumference should be 40" or less and men's waist circumference should be 35" or less.To accurately measure your waist circumference, place a non-elastic tape measure around your waist â€” right above your hip bones. Measure as you breathe out, not as you inhale., Although your main target goal is to reduce the amount of visceral fat, you will need to monitor the changes in your weight over time. Weight loss while modifying your diet and incorporating exercise can indicate your levels of visceral fat are decreasing.Weigh yourself about one to two times weekly, and always at the same time (and nude, if possible) for the most accurate reflection of your progress over time.
Safe weight loss (even when aiming to reduce visceral fat levels) is about one to two pounds weekly. Any more weight loss can result in nutrient deficiencies or may not be sustainable long-term.

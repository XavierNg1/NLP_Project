 You'll need swimsuit fabric, a sewing machine, and fittings for the machine that can handle swimsuit fabric (special needles and feet are needed).
 You can buy a pattern or find a free one online, or you can cut up an old bath suit to make your own pattern.
 Cut the fabric out using your pattern. Be sure to leave in seam allowances. Depending on the style, you will need different numbers of pieces. For a one piece suit, two panels of fabric, plus gussets for the sides and crotch, are usually necessary.
 Hem the neck, arm holes, and leg holes. If making a one piece suit, leave the side seams unhemmed. These will be joined in the next step.
 Place the front and back panels right sides together and pin the side seams in place. Then, sew the panels together, also attaching them at the crotch. If using gussets, add these before sewing the side seams.
 You're done! Put on your new bathing suit and enjoy the sun!

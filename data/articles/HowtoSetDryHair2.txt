 Set and style straight hair using a straightener. Straighteners can be used to smooth and straighten untamed hair. They can also be used to create curls and waves. Create curls by clamping the straightener down near the root of the hair and twisting your wrist while pulling it through the length of the hair.Apply a heat protector product before using a hot hair straightener.
 Create waves or curls using hot rollers. This technique is similar to velcro rollers. Divide the hair into sections and roll it into the hot rollers. Begin each roller at the bottom of the strands and tuck the hair as your roll the roller towards your scalp. Clip each roller into place and then allow the rollers to cool. Comb or finger through the curls to set them into place.Make sure that the hair is wrapped tightly around the hot roller. Use the pins provided to secure the roller in place.
Do not put hot rollers in wet hair.
 Dry hair can also be styled and set with a curling iron. Divide the hair into small sections and wrap each section around the curling iron. If you are using a curling iron with a clamp, clamp the tip of the strands and roll the curling iron towards the scalp. If you are using a curling wand, simply wrap the hair around the wand with your fingers. Set the curls using hairspray.

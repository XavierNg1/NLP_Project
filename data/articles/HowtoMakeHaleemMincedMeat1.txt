 Cooking this recipe does not take too much time, but it does require forethought and advanced action. Before you go to start cooking, make sure your ingredients are prepped.


Soak your wheat overnight; it should be drained, pounded, and husked.
Soak your channa, moong, and masoor dals for 1/2 an hour prior to cooking.

Channa dal is similar to split, black chickpea. Moong dal is a variation in wording of Mung bean.


Slice 2 onions fine and fry them up crispy in a frying pan with olive oil.
Grind your ginger (about a 2" (5 cm) piece) and garlic (6-8 flakes) into a paste. If you like it spicier, add 1 1/3 tbsp (20 g) of fresh green chilies.

You can use this paste during cooking or you can marinate the lamb in it, with salt (to taste), for an hour prior.

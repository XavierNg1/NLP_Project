 One of the most common types of insect bite that you will encounter is that of a mosquito bite. Mosquito bites will generally last for 2 to 15 days. Symptoms of a mosquito bite include:


A red, raised bump that forms at the bite site.
Itching and tenderness in the area of the bite.
 Fleas are small insects that are most commonly found on pets. If your toddler has been bitten by fleas, you should be able to find multiple, grouped red bumps that each have a central puncture bite.Flea bites are also extremely itchy.
 When a bee stings, the stinger generally falls off the bee and remains in the skin. Wasps, hornets and yellow jackets, on the other hand, can sting multiple times because they do not lose their stingers. Regardless of which insect stung your toddler, the sting itself will be very painful.The area may also become swollen and red. Gradually the spot where the stinger went in will turn white.
If your child is allergic to bee stings, you should get him or her to the hospital immediately. Signs of an allergic reaction include hives, difficulty breathing, the throat and tongue becoming swollen, dizziness, weak heartbeat, nausea, and loss of consciousness.
 Deer fly bites are painfulbecause this sort of insect has a sharp, knife-like mouth. The bite may become red and swollen. Deer flies live in moist damp environs like wetlands and forests., Fire ants latch on to the skin with their jaws and then sting the person they have attached on to. Both of these acts can be extremely painful and can be described as a ‘burning’ sensation, which is why they are called fire ants.

Their bites may also cause pustules or pimples to form at the bite site.
 Like fleas, bedbugs are tiny parasitic insects that are often found in peoples’ beds. Bed bugs don’t really pose a health threat because they are generally not thought of as disease carriers, but their bites can be very itchy and annoying.

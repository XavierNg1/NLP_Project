 Before generating a list of game questions, you must first go through all of your study materials and review critical information. While reviewing, form questions and produce a list. , Once your list is created you are ready to craft several pieces of small paper. These pieces of paper will serve as the main game pieces.


Use card stock or heavy-duty paper for sturdy game pieces.
Use sticky notes as another option to quickly create piece.
 You created your main game pieces so now you must number them according to how many questions you developed. , Place all of your numbered game pieces into the container and be careful not to forget any. Be sure to shake the container once you’ve put all your game pieces inside to ensure the pieces are mixed sufficiently.
 Keep your list of questions next to you as you pull pieces out of the container. Choose randomly from the container and read the number on the piece of paper. , Find the number on your question list that corresponds to the number on your game piece and read that question.
 After answering each question, put the used game pieces aside so as not to repeat any.


If you are unable to recall the correct answers to any questions you can make two piles designating one for challenging questions and one for easy questions.
When you play the game for again, you can just put the challenging questions inside the container and spend less time reviewing the questions you already know.
 Continue draw the papers from the container until you’ve used them all.


To play again, simply fill up the container and start over.

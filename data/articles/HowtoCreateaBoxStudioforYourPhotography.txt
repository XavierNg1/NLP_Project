 The most important thing is that it must be sturdy. You can substitute with a reusable containers, but you will have better results using something with a flat bottom. Cut out the front of the box as shown in this image––use a craft knife for ease of cutting.;
, This could be a removable camera flash, a desk lamp, a bright flashlight or something of that nature. An example of a good, portable light source is an LED lamp or flashlight.
 A reflector is a surface used to redirect light towards a given subject for the purpose of photographing it. You can use aluminum foil, white cardboard, white sheets, etc.
 You can make your own very easily using paper or even cotton sheets. Some other materials that will work well include tissue paper, wax paper, shower curtain liners, etc. In this image, an unwanted shower curtain liner has been attached to an empty frame to create a simple and quickly made diffuser.
 Place the items together in readiness for taking your photos. In this screenshot, you will see the following items assembled:


Black background (created from a sturdy mouse pad)
Diffusers (created from a picture frame and a cut piece of a shower curtain liner); the diffuser can become a part of the box by cutting away a piece of the side of the box in the same width as the frame, then taping the frame onto the box
Platform (another picture frame)
A way to raise the platform (a roll of packing tape under frame)
Two light sources (desk lamps).
 It doesn't have to be a fancy camera but you will want a tripod to ensure that your photos are easily repeatable without the lens moving. In this image, note that the camera sits on a mini-tripod and has the diffuser made in an earlier step placed behind it.

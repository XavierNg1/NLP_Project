 Becoming a competent collector often requires a deep knowledge of publication histories, preservation issues, and fair pricing. Contact librarians, archivists, rare book societies, and other book experts to help you better understand how to collect old, rare books. Ask your mentor questions about a particular volume, edition, or subject area.You’ll meet with more success if you can find a mentor to help you understand these and other fine points of book collection.
 There are many terms used to describe the overall state of a book, but some of the most important include those that describe the book’s condition, edition, binding, and inscription. Consult a glossary of antique bookselling terms to better understand these ranking and description systems.Book condition is rated as very fine, fine, very good, good, and poor/fair, with "very fine" at the top and "poor/fair" at the bottom.
 There are several ways to discern the appropriate price for an old, rare book. You could consult a book price or book value guide, many of which are available through large public or university libraries. Alternately, you could consult an expert (an antiquarian or bookdealer who specializes in the sort of book you’re interested in).Only consult the most current price guides, since prices fluctuate over time.
Knowing what you can expect to pay for a particular book will ease the shock of a high price later on.
More importantly, knowing the ballpark price range of a particular book will prevent you from getting scammed by a bookseller trying to sell a book for more than it is worth.

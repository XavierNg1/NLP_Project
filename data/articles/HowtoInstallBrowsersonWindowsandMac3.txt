 On the browser that comes with your computer (most likely Internet Explorer), head to this link:


https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/

, Once at the page, click the green “Free Download” button, and the Firefox Setup Stub installer should begin downloading.
 Click the installer and the setup should begin. Keep hitting “Next” until the installer finishes the setup.


The default settings should be enough to get you going.
 Once done, click the “Finish” button on the lower right of the installation window.


The Firefox browser icon should then be present in the desktop.

 You want to place the CPU on a hard, flat surface with the pins facing straight into the air. Be sure you have discharged any static electricity by touching a grounded metal object.;
, Typically a standard plastic credit card or gift card will do. Find a row on your CPU that has no bent pins in it. Take one of your cards, stand it on edge and gently run it through the row of pins. If the card is the right thickness it should slide between the pins with slight resistance and no bending of the pins.


If there is no contact with the pins or no resistance, then the card is too thin.
If the card is too thick you will not be able to slide the card through the pins without bowing out or bending pins. Err on the side of caution and never force the card through.
 For example, if there is one bent pin, run the card in the rows surrounding it, much like the “#” symbol. This will bend the pin straight in each direction.
 If it doesn't slide right in the socket, it is possible that there is still a bent pin. Sometimes pins in the middle can be difficult to detect.


Important: do not attempt to shove or jam the CPU in.

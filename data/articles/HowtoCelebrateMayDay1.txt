 This is usually either a young tree or a very high pole with a wreath of greens hung from the top, encircling it. Typically, long pieces of colored ribbon are attached to the top. A group of people will each grasp a piece of ribbon and dance in a circle around it, interweaving the ribbons to form a pattern around the pole. In the case of a May tree, the branches are decorated with colored ribbon.


Find a long pole or piece of wood/branch, around 10 feet or 3 meters tall.
Attach ribbons at the top using a staple gun, hammer and nails or similar. One ribbon per dancer is adequate although a spare few can be helpful if you expect extra people to turn up. The ribbons should be about three quarters the length of the pole, long enough for the dancers to grab hold of but not so long they're tripping over them (and keep the height of any children in mind). You can decorate the top of the pole if you like (to cover up the nails or staples) but it's not essential.
Fresh flowers can be woven around the ribbons at the top for a spring feel.
Dig a hole deep enough in the ground to hold the pole without swaying. Secure it in place with dirt infill. Get some help with this part, as it's hard work digging a hole and holding the pole in place while infilling with dirt.
Invite your friends over. Teach them how to dance around the maypole. There's no need to seek perfection, it takes quite a while to get it right––just have a lot of fun trying.
If you're really into the May Day celebrations, crown a May Queen as well. Traditionally, the lucky lady gets to sit in a chair (throne) decorated with fresh flowers and doesn't have to participate in the dancing or games. Prepare a fresh floral crown for her head if you're crowning a May Queen.;

Halve and pit 1 ripe avocado. Place the avocado in a food processor and add 1/2 tsp. (2.5 ml) of hot sauce (like Tabasco) and 1 tbsp. (15 ml) fresh lime juice. Set the food processor to puree or high, and puree the avocado for 30 seconds or until it is a smooth paste.



Lift the lid from the food processor and to the avocado add: 1/2 cup (120 ml) buttermilk or whole milk, 1/4 cup (60 ml) mayonnaise, 1 tbsp. (15 ml) diced red onion, 1 tbsp. (15 ml) chopped cilantro, 1 clove of garlic, 1/2 tsp. (2.5 ml) white sugar, and 1 pinch each of salt and pepper.



Replace the lid on the food processor and pulse the ingredients 5 or 6 times for about 15 seconds each time until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined. It may need a few more pulses if the garlic is not chopped finely enough.



Check the dressing for salt and pepper and adjust if required. You can add a bit more hot sauce at this point as well, if you want it a bit spicier.



All mayonnaise and milk based products should be refrigerated when not being used. Refrigerate this dressing for up to 1 week.

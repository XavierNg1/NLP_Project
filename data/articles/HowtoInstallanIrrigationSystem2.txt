The water source can be as simple as an outside water hydrant that you can attach a hose to. You will need to find the source of your water for your garden for more complicated tie-ins.
 Lay out the system using water-based spray paint.


The lines will be either just below the surface or laid on top of the ground if you are installing a drip or soaker irrigation system. This will require minimal excavation or trenching for the supply lines. It only involves laying or unrolling a small diameter line on top of flower or garden beds. Secure the line to the ground using a stake, which is easily available from an irrigation supply house.
Popup bubblers or aerial sprinkler systems will require trenching for the supply line locations of sprinkler heads.
Begin installation of the lines using PVC pipe and fittings (tees) at the locations of the sprinkler heads. Use glue and sleeves to make the connections. Cut the lines to the correct length using a PVC saw or snips.
You can begin installing your sprinkler heads and cutting the extension from the tees once the irrigation lines and tees with extensions have been installed. Use PVC glue for this.
 Increase the pressure on the line slowly as you go. Your sprinkler heads should be working at this time.
 Uncover and repair the line if you see water seeping up from the ground.

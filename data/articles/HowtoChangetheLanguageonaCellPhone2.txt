 On your Android, press the home button below your screen in the center. The home button looks like a house with an A-framed roof.


Some Samsung phones don’t have the house icon on their home button. It will just be a raised button in the bottom center of the phone.
 This is typically in a row of icons at the bottom of the screen. In a Samsung phone, it is on the far right. The icon will be a series of dots arranged in a grid.
 Older versions have a gray and blue rectangle with horizontal sliders. Newer versions will have an icon that looks like a round gear.


It is not the gear with the small “g” in the middle. This is the “Google Settings” app.
 A list will appear when you open your settings. Tapping the A icon will open your language settings.
 Once you select the “A” icon, a list of available languages will pop up. They will be listed in their native language to make it easy for you to find. For example, Spanish will say “Espanol,” and French will say “Francais.” Tap your desired language and your Android will switch to that language. Be patient; it will take approximately 30 seconds to switch.

 Water is the primary culprit in color’s bleeding and fading. While you need not swear off showers altogether (please don’t, actually), regular washing causes the dye to fade.


If you usually shower every day, try transitioning to every other day. Or: wear a shower cap to protect your color on the days you’re only washing your body.
To supplement this strategy, you can try adding a shower filter specially designed to cut down on mineral content in your water. Minerals like iron and lime are particularly harsh on dyes.This advice will be especially relevant if you’re looking to stretch out the timeline on your semi-permanent and demi-permanent hair dyes, as they’re intended to wash out after 12 and 24 shampoos respectively.
 Warm water isn’t going to be the end of your hair color, but hot showers will only expedite the color’s fading. Heat and steam opens the cuticles of your hair and allows the dye to seep out more easily.
 You’ll want to use shampoo that’s specifically marketed for color-treated hair. You should also shampoo less often, as all scrubbing and water will have a negative effect on your hair color.


If your hair’s getting too dirty with fewer shampoos from fewer showers, try out a dry shampoo to keep your hair clean in those interim periods.
 Spritz some hair sunscreen onto your damp hair to better protect your color when you’re out at the beach, or going to be in the sun for extended periods of time. UV rays continue to penetrate and bleach hair, whether it’s dyed or not.Focus on the crown of your head with the sunscreen, as it receives the most sunlight.
 Celebrity stylists suggest using a color glaze product in between dyeing sessions. Glaze will boost the brightness and gloss of your hair, combatting the natural color fade that occurs over time., As mentioned above, UV rays will bleach your hair and affect your hair color. Cover your head while you’re out and about to keep the color consistent, especially when your hair has been freshly dyed.

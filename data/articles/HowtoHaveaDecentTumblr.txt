 Make it look nice; a decent theme should not be aggressive to the eyes. Preferably use themes with a good contrast, which increases readability.;
, Re-blogging other blogs distracts other users, possibly making them like you less.
 Sometimes users will comment on a post and it will go on and on until you find yourself scrolling for a long time before seeing a post. If you see them add up, delete the comments which do not add value to the discussion. However, if they all make up a funny text post, then just leave it and laugh along.
 Tumblr is the place where everyone is equal. Nobody superior because of their race, religion, sexuality, etc.
 Make up one that is memorable and easy for people to find. For example, let's say you found this amazing blog on Tumblr. Great theme, they're in the Harry Potter fandom, and they're pretty hilarious as well. You decide to follow them, but a few days later when you want to check them out again, you can't remember their URL because it was hard to memorize.

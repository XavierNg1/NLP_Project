For iOS devices (iPhones, iPods, and iPads), tap iTunes from your device’s Springboard and download the Hulu Plus app from here.
For Android devices (smartphones and tablets), you may download the Hulu Plus app from the Google Play Store on your app screen.
For Windows phones, tap “Store” from your device’s app screen and download the Hulu Plus app from the store.
You can visit this link to view the updated list of all supported mobile devices (http://www.hulu.com/plus/devices).
 All iOS devices with full-display capability and some units of Android or Windows phones support HDMI connectivity. All you need to do is connect it to your TV using the HDMI cable or adapter included with the phone’s package.


Check your device’s user manual to see if it supports HDMI connectivity.
If no HDMI cable or adapter is included with your device’s package, you may get one from any electronics store near you.
 Use your TV’s remote control and access its settings menu to change its display output to HDMI. Your TV should display the screen of your mobile device.
 Tap it open from its Springboard or app screen, and select the video you like to watch. The video should play on your device’s screen as well as on your TV screen.

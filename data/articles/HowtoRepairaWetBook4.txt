 Drying with a hair dryer is another method better suited to damp books, though it can also be used on waterlogged items. Before drying with a blow dryer, however, all excess water must be removed. Leaving water behind could damage the book’s binding and cause mold or discoloration., This will give your book a great place to rest as you pass the dryer over the pages. Hold the book in place by placing your hand along its spine., Just as you would with your hair, hold the hair dryer 6-8 inches away from the book to avoid heat damage. Using either the cool or hot setting, move the air stream over each of the pages until they no longer feel wet, or are only slightly damp to the touch.Using a high heat setting could quickly damage the pages and run the risk of burning them. As you pass the dryer over the pages, touch them to make sure they are not growing hot. If the pages do become hot to the touch, move on to a new section and return after they have cooled.
 Going over a few pages at a time, start at the page’s binding, and move in a downward motion to the edge of the page. Go over a few pages at a time, moving on to a new section once those pages have dried.Do not dry the pages from the side, as you will likely miss some spots, and may encourage the paper to become brittle or wavy.
Drying your book quickly may cause wrinkling and page expansion. It is the fastest method, but may also do the most damage.

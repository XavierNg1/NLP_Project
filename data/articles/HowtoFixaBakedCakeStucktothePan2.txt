 The tray should be wide enough to hold your cake pan. Pour in a shallow Â¼" (6mm) layer of hot tap water.


If you don't have a tray this size, soak a dishcloth in hot water and wrap it around the base of the pan.
 The heat will cause the metal pan to expand slightly, pulling away from the cake edges. Leave it there for a few minutes to let this happen. Attempt to remove the cake as described above.
 Absorbing steam add moisture and "lift" to your cake, which can help it become unstuck. Boil water in a small saucepan or kettle, then pour it into a mug. Place the mug and the cake pan in a microwave, cupboard, or other enclosed space. Leave it there for several minutes, then try to remove the cake again.


The microwave is just a convenient size for trapping the steam in with the cake. Do not turn it on.
 Turn the pan upside down over a serving plate. Place a bowl of ice on the pan base and leave it for several minutes. Attempt to remove the cake as before.
 Let the cake cool completely at room temperature, about one hour. Freeze the cake for six hours. This makes it harder to ruin the cake's shape, and may break it loose from the pan. Run a butter knife around the edge to separate the sides, even if you already did this before freezing. Hold the pan upside down and tap the base to see if it worked.

 Your cat's treat intake should never exceed 10% of his daily calories. This may seem like it would be hard to do, but cats need very few calories every day. The average eight pound cat only needs 130 to 210 calories.


Many commercial treats have about two calories a piece, but this means your cat should have no more than six to 10 per day.
It is really important not to overfeed your cat. This can cause many health problems and shorten his lifespan., When you are giving your cat human food, you need to be very conscious of how much you give him. Any meat you give them should be in small pieces, no larger than a pencil eraser tip.


If you give them much more than this, he will get too many calories from human food, which can lead to obesity.
Too much human food can also cause his nutrition to become imbalanced., If you find that you feed your cat too many treats every day, replace some of the treats with affection instead. While treats are great ways to tell your cat you love him, petting him or having a play session with his favorite will show him you love him more.

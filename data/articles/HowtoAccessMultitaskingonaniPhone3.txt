 This is the grey icon with the cog on your home menu. Most iPhones have a feature called "Background App Refresh" that schedules updates or checks for new content automatically. This is a great tool to work with when multitasking, so you should make sure it is turned on. If you would like to turn it off, you can use the same process to access Background App Refresh's settings.
 Under "General" in "Settings," go to "Background App Refresh." This will lead you to a screen that shows the current applications with the service applied to them., To turn on Background App Refresh for a particular application, toggle the switch so that it is green. If you do not see the app you want notifications and updates from, go back to the home menu and try reopening the app. If you would like to turn this service off, which may save battery power, change the switch entitled "Background App Refresh" to grey.

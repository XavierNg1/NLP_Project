 If the interviewer does not offer a timeline for their decision-making process, you are perfectly entitled to ask for one. Find out when they expect to let candidates know their decision, who in the company will be contacting the candidates (interviewer, HR manager), and through what means - email, phone call or letter.


This is extremely useful, as it will give you some indication of how long you are expected to wait for a decision and of when it will be appropriate to follow up with the correct person.;
, This will give you the personâ€™s correct contact information, including name, title, mailing address and email address, which will save you time when you are sending your thank you note and letter.

 The key information you should be looking for are what the grade requirements are, whether you have to take additional tests, whether the course will qualify you from exception from the Common Professional Examination (although this point will be less relevant if you do not wish to become a solicitor or a barrister), what the optional subjects are and how many optional subjects you get to pick. If social life is very important to you, you could also look into the Student Law Society.;
, Although not essential, it will give you something to brag about on your application, making you stand out from the other candidates. Also, see if you can visit court (most magistrate's and crown courts have a public gallery from which you can view proceedings) and read articles/books about law.
 The majority of universities use UCAS as their only method of application but you should always double check the university prospectus or website to make sure there are no additional applications you have to do. Your UCAS personal statement could include qualities that will make you a good law student (e.g. attention to detail, enjoy reading), any legal experience you have had and, of course, why you want to study law in the first place.
 You'll need to secure good grades in order to get your place.

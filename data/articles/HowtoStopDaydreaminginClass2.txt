 Foods that are full of nutrients such as antioxidants, Vitamin E, Omega-3 oils and magnesium will all give you long lasting energy. When you choose foods that stimulate focus and give you energy you’ll be more prepared to engage in class and not daydream.


Avoid food with high sugar and fat content. These types of food will cause you to have a sugar high where your body will immediately expel the energy and then come crashing down because your body has burned all the possible energy.So don’t pick up that sugary cereal or doughnut first thing in the morning, as it won’t give you the long lasting energy you need to maintain focus and concentration.
Choose foods like blueberries that have antioxidants or whole grains that are full of good carbs to keep your energy up.When you pick up healthier foods, like a whole grain steel cut oatmeal, you won’t be daydreaming about lunchtime.
 If you want to be able to focus and not daydream you need to prepare you body as much as possible, just like you would a marathon.


If you’re not properly hydrated you can suffer from poor concentration and headaches.Being thirsty will also draw your focus away from whatever task you have in front of you and lead to distractions like daydreaming.
 While daydreaming in class isn’t a good idea, daydreaming is good for you.Take some time for yourself to relax. When you prepare your mind and body you’ll be better suited to keep focus and not daydream.


Using a planner or calendar application can help you map out your day- including that free time. It’ll help you get into routine before you are used to it.
You can try yoga, taking a nap, watching something on Netflix, or listening to some music. Having a leisurely activity planned in your day will give you a stress free outlet as a reward for maintaining focus throughout the day.

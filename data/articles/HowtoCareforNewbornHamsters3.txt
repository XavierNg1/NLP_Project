 Successfully raising orphaned hamsters is almost unheard of. Newborn hamsters are born very poorly developed, and need a precise balance of nutrition. The mother's milk is the best source for their needs, and manmade replacements won't help them grow healthy organs and bones the same way.Donâ€™t be disheartened if the orphans die. Their odds were never good, but at least you gave it a go.
 Even if you have a lactating female without babies of her own, there's a high likelihood that she would cannibalize any strange babies you put in with her. A non-lacting female won't have the milk the babies need.
 The closest you can get to hamster milk is Lactol, which is a milk replacement designed for use with dogs.Hamster pups need strict hourly feeding 24 hours a day until they start to eat solids. Luckily, they usually begin showing interest in solids early, at around 7-10 days. Once they start eating solids, you can reduce their milk feeding to once every three hours.
 Hold the drop against the baby's mouth. Hopefully, it will try to suckle, or at least lick the milk from the tip.


Avoid squirting milk into the hamster pup's mouth. They're so tiny that even a small amount of fluid could flood down into the hamster's lungs and either drown them or cause pneumonia.
This is one of the main reasons orphans are so difficult to rear.
 Keep them at a constant temperature of at least 70 F by either using a heat pad or keeping the room at that temperature.


The babies will be comfortable in temperatures up to 80F. Above this, the youngsters may start to develop heat stress.
When the pups are in the nest, partially cover them with bedding to help keep them warm.

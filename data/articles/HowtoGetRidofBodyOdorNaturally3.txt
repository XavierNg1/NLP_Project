 You can use apple cider vinegar to help kill off the odor-causing bacteria. Soak your feet daily in a solution of 1 part apple cider vinegar and 3 parts water. Pour the same solution into a spray bottle and spray on your armpits. Apple cider vinegar is very strong and people with sensitive skin may experience adverse side effects like burning or itching. Therefore, a small patch test is recommended before using this product and make certain you have not just shaven your armpits.

 These are easily installed with this command: sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libace-dev libmysql++-dev subversion mercurial openssl libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libmysqlclient15-dev libtool mysql-client unrar.;
, This will install the packages to your computer.
 Make three folders, named bin, src and db. The commands are mkdir bin, mkdir src and mkdir db.
 Go to the "src" directory with CD src and type the command hg clone http://www.bitbucket.org/KingPin/trinitycore/ For TC1 (2.4.3) or hg clone http://www.bitbucket.org/KingPin/trinitycore2/ for TC2 (3.0.9).
 Go to the build directory with cd build.
 There are several ways to configure the process, but this guide will assume that you are using MySQL for the server's database needs and that you want the default configuration. Type the command cmake ../ -DPREFIX=/home/yourusername/bin.
 If you want the build process to go faster, you can first type make genrev and then make -j3 or make -j5. This works best on dual-core processors and quad-core processors respectively.
, This will copy the necessary executable files to the /home/yourusername/bin directory.
 There are a number of tools in the "src/trinitycore/contrib/" directory that serve this purpose.
 copy it to the WoW root directory (example: C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\) and run it. Copy the two new directories, "dbc" and "maps" to the /home/yourusername/bin/bin/ directory on the Linux computer. Check your hard drive space before running ad.exe, however. The program requires at least 1.5GB of space before running., Run the file "makevmaps_SIMPLE.bat" and copy the new directory "vmaps" to the /home/yourusername/bin/bin/ directory on the Linux computer. Remove the "buildings" directory. Remember, makevmaps takes even more hard drive space than ad.exe, it requires at least 2GB., Go to your home directory with cd /home/yourusername and type the command svn checkout http://svn.assembla.com/svn/trinitydatabase/ db.
 This directory contains SQL dumps that must be inserted into the MySQL database. This guide will not provide any examples of inserting SQL queries. You may, of course, use whatever MySQL interface you prefer.
 Execute the script "characters.sql" in the characters database and execute the script "realmd.sql" in the realmd database. Both of these can be obtained from the src/trinitycore/sql directory.,, These files are called core updates. They must be applied to their corresponding databases in the correct order from number 1098 and up(TC1) or 1733 and up(TC2).
 Make the id 1, name servername, address externalipaddress, port 8085, icon 0, color 0, timezone 8, allowedSecurityLevel 0, population 0., The two files in here act as configuration files for the server. They must be renamed to work, so remove the trailing ".dist" at the end of the filename.(If they don't have the .dist extension, you need to turn off the "hide extensions for known filetypes" option (google it) Now open the file "trinitycore.conf"., Make sure it is the same as you just put in the database.
 These must be set to the username and password of your MySQL database. Replace the ";trinity;trinity;" with ";username;password;"., These must be changed from 0 to 1., Fix the "DatabaseInfo" options as you did in the previous file.,, Do the same again except type ./trinity-realm., To connect with your WoW client, simply access the file "realmlist.wtf" in the WoW root directory (2.4.3) or World of Warcraft\Data\{locale} (enUS or enGB for example)(3.0.9) and change it's contents to "set realmlist computeripaddress". When you connect with your client, it should connect to the Trinity server!,,, Type the command hg pull and then hg update.(This can also be done in one step by using hg pull -u) This will download the latest source code.
, If you were previously on revision 1312, and a file that begins with 1313 is present, apply it and everything above. It is advisable to keep note of the latest file before doing step 31., Apply the new files named "updatepack" in ascending numerical order to the world database. Ignore the "corepatch" files.
 Simply start the binaries and enjoy.

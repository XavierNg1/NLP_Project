 Scratches in the clear coat can be repaired without adding any additional paint. Before you can get started, wash and dry the area around the scratch to make sure thereâ€™s no dirt or debris that could result in new scratches during the repair process.Bits of dirt could cause additional scratches in the clear coat as you buff the scratch out.
Make sure the paint is dry if the scratch remover you purchased requires dry paint.
 Apply a small amount of scratch removing compound to a buffing pad and apply it to the scratched area in a circular motion. Continue to rub the compound into the scratch firmly until the compound is dry.Read the instructions on the scratch remover your purchase, as some will have variations in their application methods.

 Once done, use a clean rag to wipe away any excess scratch remover compound that remains on the paint. There will likely be a build of the compound around the outside edges of the portion you treated.Make sure you to wipe the compound away completely.
 Fill a bucket with water and a small amount of automotive soap. Then rinse entire vehicle paying close attention to the area you just repaired. Wash the entire car thoroughly, then wax the car.

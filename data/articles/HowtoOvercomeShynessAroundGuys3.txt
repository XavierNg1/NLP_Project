 This may be the most important aspect of overcoming shyness around guys. You are worth a lot just because you’re you. You don’t need guys’ approval for that to be so. If you believe in your self-worth and believe that you don’t need anyone else’s approval, you will find that you feel more confident around guys.Look at your accomplishments, your friendships, what makes you unique. This can help you gain a perspective on what's awesome about you.
Don't compare yourself to others. This can only hurt whether by making you feel superior to others or by making feel like you don't measure up.
 No one is perfect. In fact, often when you ask perfectionists what being perfect would mean, they don’t have a clear idea themselves, or the image is someone they’ve idealized beyond reality. In any case, perfection is unattainable. You can, however, be the best 'you' you can be.When you think about being perfect, instead ask yourself what it is you really want. Often it's external influences that want us to be perfect, and you may find that being perfect gets in the way of what you really want, such as happiness, writing a book, or anything else that you might have a goal.
 This can be hard to do, when you’re nervous, but it is important to realize that just because you don’t act exactly the same in every situation does not mean you aren’t being yourself. You wouldn’t ask your boss for something the same way you’d ask your parents for something. Expressing your confidence around guys may look different than expressing your confidence in school or in writing.If you are embarrassed about something in your life (where you live, the car you drive, etc.), you may need to stop and take stock of why you feel that way. Is it others' expectations?
When someone doesn't like something you like, say, "That's cool, but I like what I like." They can make fun of you or bully you for it, but they can't make you not like it.

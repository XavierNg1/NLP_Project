 This will open the desktop’s context menu.;
, Hover over the “New” section in the context menu. When the submenu appears, click “Folder.” A new small folder should appear on your desktop.
 Once the new folder is created, you will need to rename it in order to access GodMode. Right-click the new folder, and select “Rename” from the drop-down menu.


Copy and paste this file name: GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}
Once this is done hit Enter on your keyboard. The new folder icon should change to look like the Control Panel icon.
 Once the GodMode is created, you may want to get to know the new control panel a little bit better. This file is quite complex, as it contains about 270 different options, from 42 different categories, that allow you to control virtually any part of your system.


Open the new GodMode folder by double-clicking it. Once open, right-click the top item in the new window, and select “Collapse all groups” from the drop-down menu. This will allow you to view more of the different menu items that are now available to you.

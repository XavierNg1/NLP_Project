 When an employer issues you a written warning, it is likely to be about a disciplinary issue. They do the written warning for themselves to have on record and to bring your attention to it. The warning should clearly state the specific performance issue. The warning may also include possible consequences likely to come if your performance doesn’t improve., These written warnings will often be followed up by a conversation. This could come from either your employer or a supervisor. In this conversation, the problem will be discussed as well as potential changes to make to ensure there is no further problem.


Don’t get defensive. In this meeting, it will be smarter to own up to your mistake rather than fight about it. It will show responsibility and improved judgement.
If you truly feel that you are being wrongly accused, remember to stay calm when discussing it. Go into the meeting prepared to discuss valid points about the issue.
 Depending on the severity of the issue, set up a follow-up discussion. This will be a good time to show your employer that you take the notice very seriously and that you’ve changed. If the issue has continued, your employer will be able to make you aware of it here, before having to issue another written warning. Treat meetings as an ongoing process rather than an isolated event.If they have to issue another written warning, your job could be on the line. The consequences should have been listed out in the original warning.

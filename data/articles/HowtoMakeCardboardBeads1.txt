 Take a pair of scissors and cut a sheet of corrugated cardboard into triangles of different widths. You can also experiment with others shapes and sizes. Ultimately you just need a long piece of cardboard that you can roll up.You can find colored pieces of corrugated cardboard that are smooth on one side and bumpy on the other at your local craft store.;
, Once you cut out your shapes, brush some mod podge onto the smooth side of the corrugated cardboard. The glue will help the bead hold its shape. Try not to apply too much glue and make the cardboard soggy.You can find Mod Podge or craft glue at your local craft store.
 One at a time, wrap your pieces of cardboard around a straw. Make sure that the smooth side is facing in and the corrugated (bumpy) side is facing out. The side with the glue needs to be on the inside to hold the bead together. Once the glue dries – usually about 20 seconds – you will have a bead. After the glue has dried, remove the straw from the bead. Repeat to make the rest of your beads.Be sure to glue and then wrap each bead one at a time. If you apply glue to multiple pieces of cardboard and then wrap them, the glue will likely dry on some before you wrap them.
You can wrap multiple beads on the same straw.
 You can now use your corrugated beads for your project.

 Don’t give your email address to untrusted or unknown entities. From retail rewards programs to weekly newsletter services, everyone wants your email address. When you put your email address out there, remember that you don’t know exactly where it’s going. Don’t give your email address to just anyone!;
, Be wary of forwards and passing them along to friends. If you’ve forwarded something to a friend and then they forward it on, now your email address is part of a chain that will be passed around to people you don’t know.
 Set up an alternative email address to use when creating logins or signing up with something you can’t verify.
 Doing so tells the spammer that your email address is good.


This includes “unsubscribe” links found in spam email. These links will not actually unsubscribe you, and they will not reduce the amount of spam you get but rather put you at risk. On the other hand, selecting unsubscribe links in emails from trusted sources—to which you have previously subscribed—is fine, as these links are what they say.
This also means don’t buy anything from a spammer. Someone must be buying from them, because spammers are sticking around and even multiplying. Make sure you’re not the one keeping them in business.

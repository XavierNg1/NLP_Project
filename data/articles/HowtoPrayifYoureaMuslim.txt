 And mean it. You could say something like "I'm doing ___rakat for _____prayer facing the Kabah for Allah." 1 = How many rakats you are doing, 2,3, or 4. 2 = Fajr, Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib, or Isha;
, If you are a male, raise your arms up to about ears length. If you are a female, raise your arms up to about shoulder length

, It's "sana subhanaka Allah humma wa bihamdika wa tabara kasmuka wa taala juduka wa laailaha ghayruk. A'oodhu billahi mina shaytanir-rajeem, Bismillahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem." It may take a while to memorize if you don't know it already, but you'll get there eventually!

, "Alhamdulillahi rabbil a'lameen, ar-Rahmaanir-Raheem, Maliki yaumiddeen, Iyyaka na'abudu wa iyyaka nasta'een, Ihdina siratal mustaqeem, Swiratal ladheena an'amta alaihim, Ghairil maghdoobi alaihim wala daleen, Aameen."

,, Bend down with your hands on your knees and say 3 times, "Subhana Rabi-aal azeem"

,, Refer to the picture in the introduction for the position of sujood. Say, "Subhana Rabi-aal aala. Make sure you do sujood twice. "

,, Put your hands on your knees and say At-Tayaat. Refer to an Islamic website for At-Tayaat. Then say Durood. Refer to a website. Then say "Rabaana A-Tina fiddunya hasanatow wa fil akhirati hasana tow wa khina azabanaar" Depending on how many rakats you do, this will be different. For the first time you sit down you only say At-Tayaat. The second time you say Durood and Rabbana A-Tina

, You are greeting and putting peace on the Angels on your shoulders recording your deeds.

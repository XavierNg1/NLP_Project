 Make sure that one of the 105 oz cans has the bottom on it but not the top. The other 105 oz can has both ends off. The 19-20 oz can should only have the bottom on it.;
, Trace as close to the bottom as you can. Once this is done, you can use the drill to get a hole in the center of the circle, and use the tin snips to cut the circle out.
,, After the can is in, use the cement gun to glue all around the the places to secure the cans in place. Cement on the inside and outside.
 Take the second 105 oz can and take the sharpie and draw in one of the grooves about halfway down. Use the small drill bit to drill four holes in the can along the line, across from each other so it can be used to stick the coat hanger through.
 Once it is straight, cut it in half and then cut it to about 9 inches per piece. After the wire is straight and cut, put the wire into the holes, and across the can, so each wire goes through two holes and the wires cross each other like and x in the middle of the can. Then, cement the inside and outside of the holes.
 Cement the two cans together.
 This will help to keep the heat in the right space.
 This is to hold the wood up, so it lights. There should be a space under the mesh, and a space above it.
 It's good to have a small pan that will fit inside of the large can and rest on the coat hanger.

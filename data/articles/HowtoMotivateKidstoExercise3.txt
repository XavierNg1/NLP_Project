 It is better to allow your child a little time to adjust to the idea than to turn your child off completely. Start with 5 minutes a day of a light physical activity. Continue this routine for a week before increasing the time by a minute or 2 and continue to gradually increase the time until your child is exercising for at least 15 minutes a day.
 Rather than 15 minutes of one light exercise, do 5 minutes each of 3 different exercises. Start with the usual light activity for 5 minutes, then switch over to a more vigorous activity for 5 minutes and conclude the final 5 minutes with a lighter activity again.
 Using this gradual approach allows your child to slowly adjust to an exercise program with much less resistance.

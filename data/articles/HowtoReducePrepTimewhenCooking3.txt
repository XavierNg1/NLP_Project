 Before diving in to whip up dinner, take a moment to visualize each task. Check your recipe or estimate how long everything will take to preheat, prep, and cook so you can figure out how to multitask your meal.Form a quick strategy and map everything out. Can you slice the onions while the oven preheats, saucepan gets hot, and butter melts? Maybe you can season the salmon and pop it in the oven while you caramelize the onions for a quick sauce. Then, five minutes before the salmon’s done, warm the potatoes and carrots you roasted this morning. Just before taking the fish out of the oven, deglaze the onions with some white wine and add herbs to finish the sauce.  

, If you have kids, cut down on your prep work by having them perform age-appropriate tasks, like washing or chopping veggies or whisking up a dressing. In addition to organizing and dividing the labor, you’ll spend quality time together.You could also invite a friend over to cook together. Prep and cooking will go faster, and you can socialize without spending the money you would at a restaurant., Peels, stems, eggshells, trimmings, wrappers, and other odds and ends inevitably pile up when prepping and cooking meals. Instead of running back and forth to the trash can, keep a large bowl or container by your prep area so you can quickly toss away scraps.Since you won’t be running across your kitchen with handfuls of food scraps, you’ll probably keep your floor cleaner, too.

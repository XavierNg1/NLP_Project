 Garlic is a very strong flavor, so a little bit goes a long way. It's easy to overestimate how much you'll need, so be careful not to get too much.;
, You want a very nice white shelled bulb, free of any black spots. Make sure the garlic you get all has its own distinctive shell.
 This is key to keeping garlic fresh. Keep it in a dark, cool, dry place, maybe in a container or a glass. It's okay to leave it sitting out on a counter, but try to keep it away from heat, moisture, and too much sunlight.
 Garlic can go bad very quickly once you peel it, so make sure to do so only just before you use it.Â

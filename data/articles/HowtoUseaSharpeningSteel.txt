 Steels are maintenance tools used to help keep an already sharp blade from degrading. If your knives are dull, pitted, or you see visible nicks on the cutting edge, bring your blade to a professional for resharpening.;
, For safety reasons, the preferred method is to place the tip of the steel on a cutting board while you hold the steel vertically.



Position the knife (ideally), at a 22 degree angle. This angle is considered standard, although you can adjust this slightly to a lower angle for a sharper edge, or a higher angle for a more durable one.
 Pull the knife down and towards yourself, ending with the tip of the knife at the bottom of the steel. Maintain the same angle as you go, and pull your hand away from the steel gradually, so as to evenly hone from the blade base to tip.
, Check for sharpness and repeat if necessary. The quality, hardness and pre-existing condition of the blade will determine the ultimate number of strokes required.
 This is important to avoid adding any metal filings that may have been generated from honing into your recipe.

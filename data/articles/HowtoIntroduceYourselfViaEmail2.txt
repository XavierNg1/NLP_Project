 Let the recipient know how you found out their contact information. This helps show that you went through the proper channels to reach them.


"Your office manager directed me towards this email address"
"I found this email address on your website"
"So-and-so said that I should get in contact with you"

, Jogging the person's memory can lead to more engagement.


"We talked briefly at the conference last week"
"We spoke on the phone yesterday"
"I saw your presentation on..."

, This can help you relate to your recipient, and keeps your business emails from seeming too cold. In order to determine mutual interests, you may need to do a little research on the recipient. Possible research areas include Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.


Make sure you let the person know where you found this mutual interest, otherwise you'll come off as a stalker.
If possible, try to keep the mutual interest business-related, such as something in your field or a professional passion you both share.
 Don't wait too long to get to the point. No one is going to read an email that is multiple paragraphs long before anything resembling the point appears. Explain clearly and straightforwardly what you want and why you're contacting that person about it. If you are asking for advice or making some other request, make sure it is manageable, especially if this is your first contact.


"I'm interested in learning more about..."
"I'd like to meet with you sometime to discuss..."
"I would like your opinion on..."

, Letting your email meander can cause your recipient to lose interest or forget about why you were emailing in the first place. Keep your introductory email simple and only ask the recipient one thing.

 As a potential candidate, you want your search firm to be working on behalf of the types of companies you want to work for. You also want them to have positions available that are at your level.


Sign on with a search firm that is well respected in your field or industry. Like the companies themselves, you want to work with a firm that has experience in your area.
 A resume is a logical start, and you may be asked for references as well. If you are currently working, the firm should guarantee discretion.
 A search firm will likely do a thorough background check on behalf of their clients, and you want them to feel good about placing you.
 The more your search firm knows about your career goals and desires, the better it will make a good match for you.
 Getting to know the search firm you are working with is important. Even if you do not qualify for any of their current open positions, you want them to remember you for the future.
 Whether that advice is to take a class and learn a specific skill or scale back your requirements for bonuses and stock options, the search firm is speaking from experience.

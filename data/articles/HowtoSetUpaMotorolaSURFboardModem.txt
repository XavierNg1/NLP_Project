 Take the coaxial cable coming from the wall (similar to the coaxial cable connected to your TV for your cable service) and plug it to the coaxial port located behind the SURFboard modem. Make sure that you secure the connection firmly by screwing the coaxial cable onto the modem port.;
, Take the Internet cable included in the modem package and plug it to the “Ethernet” port at the back of the SURFboard. Plug the other end of the Internet cable to the network (LAN) port at the back of your computer or laptop.


There’s going to be only one port on your computer where this cable can fit, so it won’t be hard to identify.
 Get the power adapter and plug it to the power port located behind the SURFboard modem. Plug the other end of the adapter to an electrical outlet.
 Press the Standby/Power button at the top side of the SURFboard to switch it on. The status lights of the modem will start to blink.
, If you only have a blue flashing light for downstream (the light right below the power light) then you must contact your internet provider and register your modem with them.

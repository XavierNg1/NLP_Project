 Is he a stray? Did you breed him yourself? Where did you get him? Find what your cat's life was like before you received him. You can ask the previous owner, the doctor, or the people who work at the Animal Shelter.;
, If he was a stray, try to imagine how lonely and terrifying it must have been. When doing this, you will be able to see his world through his own eyes.
 For example, if you accidentally step on his tail and he bites you, don't yell at him. You are the one, after all, who hurt him in the first place. Before you got him, he might have been stepped on and it could have really, really hurt him. In other words, understand what's he's going through, being your cat. Put yourself in him position.
 Don't scream at him hour after hour if he breaks something. Realize that he's just a cat. It's not his fault. Even if it was your favorite vase brought here all the way from Brazil, that's what you get for having a cat. You're the one keeping him in captivity, so know that it's not his problem: it's yours. There's nothing else to say.
 This is a pretty broad step, but it has to be added. Your cat is your cat. Treat him like it. You are 50 times bigger than he is, and he is forced to live with you, so treat him as your family. Treat him as a fine guest in your household, and let him know through your actions that you never, ever, ever, want him to leave.

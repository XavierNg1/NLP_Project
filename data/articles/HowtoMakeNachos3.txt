 These dessert nachos are a delicious way to end a Mexican-themed meal. The flavors of cinnamon and sugar bring out the best in flour tortilla chips. Pick up these ingredients in preparation:


Flour tortilla chips. The fresher the better, light and crispy. Try to find unsalted chips, though the contrast of sweet and salty can be nice.2 tablespoons white sugar
Â¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup butter, melted
Chocolate syrup
Caramel syrup
Whipped cream

, Place a small saucepan on the stove and put the butter in the pan. Turn the burner to medium high and let the butter melt completely. You can also opt to just place the butter in the microwave.
 Place the chips on a baking sheet. Drizzle the butter over the chips, doing your best to distribute it evenly. Use tongs to gently toss the chips so they get evenly coated in butter.
 Mix the cinnamon and sugar together in a small bowl, then sprinkle the mixture over the chips. Use the tongs to toss the chips to ensure they all get a coating of sugar and spice.
 Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake the chips for about 15 minutes, or until they turn golden brown and crispy.
 Drizzle chocolate syrup and caramel sauce over the chips. Place a dollop of whipped cream in the center of the platter.
 Put the baked chips on a large platter. Invite your guests to dig in.


You can also dish out the nachos onto individual serving plates.
This dish is delicious with ice cream, especially chocolate or vanilla flavors.

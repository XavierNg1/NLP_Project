 Plantain plants have many different parts, including the leaves, roots, tough, fibrous shoots and flowering seed stalks. For most recipes, it will be easiest to work with just the leaves. Pull the leaves gently from their stems and set them aside in a shallow bowl or colander for rinsing.Throw out any slimy, mottled or discolored leaves you happen to come across while you’re sorting—these can spoil the whole bunch.If you want, you can hold onto the shoots and seeds and use them for other culinary projects.;
, Run the leaves under a stream of cool water while tossing them lightly by hand. This will help remove any loose dirt or debris clinging to them. For a more thorough cleaning, let the leaves soak at the bottom of a bowl of water for a minute or two.Swishing the leaves in a mixture of water and apple cider vinegar can also help kill any lingering bacteria.
To dry the leaves, shake off the excess water, then sandwich them between layers of folded paper towels., Plantain leaves can grow quite large, so you’ll often have to cut them to make them more manageable. Stack the leaves on top of one another and slice them into halves or quarters, or simply tear them to the desired size by hand. The exact size of the leaves will depend largely on the recipe you plan to use them in.Young plantains bear small, tender leaves that can be eaten whole.You can also use a mandoline or a pair of herb scissors to cut the leaves into strips for soups, slaws and garnishes.

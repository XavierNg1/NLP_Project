 Make sure to play and interact with your cat for at least 30 minutes a day. This can be done in two or three, short 10 to 15-minute play sessions throughout the day. Playing with your cat will exhaust it and help it sleep better at night.Use interactive toys such as toys that imitate the movements of birds and mice.
Ping-pong balls, cardboard boxes, and crumpled pieces of paper are also great ways to keep your cat entertained during the day.
 A big meal before bedtime will cause your cat to become drowsy and want to sleep. If you decide to do this, just make sure to adjust the size of its other meals so it does not gain weight.For example, feed your cat a smaller amount of food before you leave for work. Once you are ready to go to bed, feed your cat the rest of its food.
 Keep your cat busy during the day when you are at work with cat perches and food puzzles. You can even install bird feeders outside to attract birds and other animals to your backyard. This way, your cat can watch the excitement outside while you are away.Make sure to provide your cat with a variety of toys, and switch them out often as well.
Cat videos are a new form of entertainment for cats today. Set up a timer on your TV to play these videos throughout the day to keep your cat busy.

 Well known prepaid providers include Tracfone, Virgin Mobile, Amp'd, Boost Mobile, and Net-10. A lot of contract providers also offer prepaid options. These include T-mobile, Verizon Wireless Prepaid, and AT&T GoPhone.;
, Prepaid phones usually cost more, and come with less downloads and features.

, By the minute and by the dollar. By the minute plans (like TracFone) Feature minute accounts. Each minute is deducted from a bank of minutes. These plans don't usually have may downloads. By the dollar (Like Go-Phone) plans have money in place of minutes. Each minute costs somewhere around 10 cents a minute. The plans often have a lot of downloads.

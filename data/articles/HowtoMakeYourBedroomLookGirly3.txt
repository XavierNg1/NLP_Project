 Choose paint in bold colors like turquoise, teal, orange or red. Patterned wallpaper also adds an eclectic feel.
 Recycled or vintage-looking furniture adds uniqueness. Some examples include:


A brass daybed.
A vintage steamer trunk for storage.
An old-fashioned school desk.
Floor lamps with patterned shades.
 Don't be afraid to mix patterns and colors â€” this applies to bedding, rugs and curtains. A patterned quilt and throw pillows in bright hues or graphic prints will add a bit of bohemian quirkiness.

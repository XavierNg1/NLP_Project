 This brings up a simplified menu for formatting your Document, as it is even easier than using the desktop app.
 You have many options for the placement of your numbers, including some artistic options.
 This allows you to set a different first page, change how odd and even pages look, or remove your page numbers entirely., Any changes made in the app will work on the desktop programs, so you can safely add or change page numbers here and they will stick when you send the document to another program.

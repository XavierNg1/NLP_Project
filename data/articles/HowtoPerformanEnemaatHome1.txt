 Although spurring an evacuation with the help of an enema is relatively easy, you will need a few essential supplies:


A couple of large, old towels
A teaspoon of organic almond oil, olive oil, or coconut oil for lubrication
One quart distilled water at body temperature
A clean enema kit
A book or magazine — it’ll come in handy!

, There should be a place for your enema bag or bucket to sit or hang from (it should be about 2-3 feet above the floor).


Make sure your resting area is close to the bathroom, if not in it. Once you perform the enema, you may only have a few seconds until the body decides it needs to evacuate. If this happens and you're not near a toilet, you're in for some trouble.
 An enema kit usually comes with


A bag for the liquid
A hook to hang the bag up
A hose
A plug
A rectal tip

, Make it as comfortable as possible.

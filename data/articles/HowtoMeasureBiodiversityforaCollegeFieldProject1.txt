What creatures fascinate you the most (for example, crabs)?
As you’re doing a project likely inspired by conservation, what ecosystems (which contain those fascinating creatures) are in dire need of conservation (for example, tropical oceans)?
Then, research to find which organisms are classified as threatened or endangered to specify a project location (for example, a nearby state park). Greater diversity stems from a large sample size. Thus: more area → more specimens, more specimens → more species get recorded;
,,, A type of sample method is a quadrant, which is a plot of land marked off for the study of plants or animals. Although the term implies a four-sided area, this is not necessary – many shapes are satisfactory. Continuing with the above example, you may instead use baited crab pots randomly placed at specific depths and distances apart throughout applicable areas in the Evergreen Beach.

Seek to achieve randomness in your sampling. For example:

Get a map of the project location
Draw a precise grid with many squares on the map
Label each square on the map with a number
Use a random number generator to choose squares.


To ensure great distance between samples, make each square very far apart and then designate a smaller sample area within the original square chosen by the generator.

 The Javanese's coat requires very little maintenance because it does not have an undercoat. Once or twice a week, use a stainless steel comb to remove any dead hair from your pet. Use treats and praise to make sure your cat is amenable during the process., Check your cat's eyes and ears at least once a week. Use a soft, damp cloth to remove dirt or debris from eyes and ears, and check for signs of medical issues (e.g. dark discharge, redness). Pet and praise your cat during this process, which should be fairly easy given the Javanese's friendly temperament.If you see any signs of medical issues, consult your veterinarian.
 Prevent periodontal disease in your Javanese by brushing its teeth once a week. Start introducing the cat to the toothpaste by placing it on a toothbrush and letting your cat taste it. Once your cat licks or chews on the toothbrush on its own, you can attempt to brush its teeth while bracing its face gently but firmly.Purchase special toothpaste for your Javanese cat from a pet store. Never use human toothpaste, which may contain ingredients that are toxic to cats (e.g. Xylitol).

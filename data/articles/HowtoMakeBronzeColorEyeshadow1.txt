 Liquid Eyeshadows will look better, but you can use powders too. You will need: A soft red, A light brown, A dark brown, and a deep gold. A deep white will help to make something lighter if you make a mistake, and if you can find a yellow that could help you achieve your perfect bronze. These can have shimmer, but no glitter.
 Squeeze some into a small container (preferably that used to hold eyeshadow), or scrap some out using the back of a paint brush if you are using powder.
 Try to bear in mind the colour may change when you add the colours. Always keep it about two shades lighter, because you will be adding gold. Mix it in with the paint brush.
 You can decide how much to put in, but this is a crucial part of getting the shimmery quality bronze has.
 Again, you determine how red you want your bronze to be.
 This will brighten up your eyeshadow and could make a dramatic difference.
 This will help it to stick together and merge into one eyeshadow.

 Fill a medium saucepan halfway with water and set it to a simmer over medium heat.


Do not allow the water to reach a full boil.
 Slide the egg off so that it sticks to the bottom of the pan. Allow it too cook there for a full 1 minute.


Add the eggs to the simmering water one at a time.






You can technically break the eggs directly into the water instead of lowering them in with a spoon or ladle, but breaking the eggs into the water may make it more difficult to control how the eggs turn out.
 After cooking the eggs on the bottom of the pan for 1 minutes, gently scrape them up from the bottom of the pan using a heat-resistant spatula. Continue cooking for another 3 to 5 minutes.


The yolk will still be fairly runny once done.
 Lift each poached egg from the water, draining away excess water through the slots in the spoon. Enjoy immediately.

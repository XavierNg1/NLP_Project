 In spite of what you may think, your face really is the first thing your boyfriend notices, so keep up a sexy appearance and the rest will follow.


If you feel comfortable wearing makeup, put on just enough to give your eyes a smoky look and your lips a nice luscious tint.
Give your boyfriend sexy glances. Just the look in your eyes can let him know how you really feel about him.
 Knowing that you have it on can make you feel sexy, or showing your man a hint of what you have planned for later can make him excited for the rest of your night. Some sexy items include:


A thong, lacy underwear, a push up bra, pearls, a corset, knee-high socks, or spandex.
Avoid any uncomfortable fabrics that can lead to chafing, which is the opposite of sexy.
 You don't need to always wear designer thongs or teddies. As long as you wear something out of the norm that shows more skin, your man will think it's sexy that you're wearing it for his benefit.


Don't wear anything so elaborate that it will be impossible to remove. This may lead to frustration and other mishaps in the bedroom.
 If your clothes are revealing more than they're hiding, your boyfriend will be embarrassed to be seen with you instead of turned on.


Make sure your dresses and skirts are like a good story--short enough to keep things interesting, but long enough to cover everything.
It's good to show a little cleavage, but not so much that most of your chest is exposed.
Showing a little bit of bra strap can be sexy, but exposing your entire bra is too much.
 Care for your other extremities so your man will be even more excited by you.


Take care of your hands and fingernails so your man will be turned on when he holds them.
Keep your feet nice and fresh so you smell sexy in the bedroom.

 In addition to treating cardiac disease with medication, you will need to make changes to your older dog’s lifestyle. For example, your vet will recommend switching your dog to a low-salt diet, which will help prevent fluid buildup in your dog’s body.Low-salt prescription diets are available through your vet.Switch your dog to the new diet gradually. Over one to two weeks, mix more of the new diet in with the old diet until your dog is eating only the new diet.
Let your vet know if your dog does not like the new diet. Your vet may recommend another diet for your dog.
 Dogs with cardiac disease can’t tolerate much exercise because their hearts don’t work very well.To manage your older dog’s cardiac disease, limit your dog’s exercise. Rather than taking your dog for a run or playing fetch, take your dog for easy, leisurely walks.


Your older dog’s heart shouldn’t have to work any harder than it has to.
 Like exercise, stress can make a dog’s heart beat faster and work harder. Without a well-functioning heart, your dog won’t be able to handle stress very well.Keep your dog’s life as stress free as possible:


Keep your dog’s daily routine the same.
If you have young children, do not let them play roughly with your dog.
Limit your dog’s interactions with unfamiliar pets or people.
 Excess weight can put stress on a dog’s body and make the heart work harder. If your dog is overweight, help it lose weight.Because you won’t be able to increase your dog’s physical activity by very much, you may need to make adjustments to your dog’s diet.


Talk with your vet about ways to get your dog to its ideal weight.
If your dog is already at an ideal weight, try to maintain this ideal weight by not overfeeding your dog or giving it table foods.

 Sprinkle both sides of the steaks with salt, pepper, cumin, and garlic powder.Note that many steak tacos simplify the process by eliminating seasonings other than salt or pepper, or by omitting the seasonings altogether. This creates a slightly more flavorful taco meat, but you can prepare steak for tacos even if you omit this step.
Skirt steaks work well, but rib eye or sirloin will also work as long as the steak is 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) thick or thinner.
If you are uncertain about how much salt and pepper to use, start with 1 tsp (5 ml) salt and 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) pepper.
 Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.


Give the oil a few minutes to heat up. It should be ready to use once it appears to glisten.
For a more authentic taste, use lard instead of vegetable oil.
 Add the steaks to the pan in a single layer and brown them for about 4 to 6 minutes, turning once in the middle.


If you cannot fit all your steaks into the pan at once, cook as may as possible without crowding the pan and wrap them in aluminum foil once finished. Then proceed to cook your remaining steaks.



As they rest, the steaks will continue to cook and the juices will redistribute themselves throughout the meat. As a result, the steaks will be juicier than they would be without this resting period.
 Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut the steak into thin ribbons across the grain. Serve or store when finished.


The "grain" refers to the visible muscle fibers in the meat. Cutting across the grain will make the steak more tender, but cutting with the grain will make it tougher and harder to chew.

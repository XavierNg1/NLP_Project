 Look for something cordial and positive about her to comment on when you are ready to approach her. Be genuine with your compliments and make your conversation nonchalant, fun and witty at the same time. You will probably catch a smile or giggle from her. Compliment that she has pretty hair or that she looks nice.;
, Be yourself. Your body language reflects how you feel. Being relaxed will show you are confident and amiable. Otherwise, you may appear awkward, or worse, look like someone to avoid.
 Show respect for her even as you are flirting-- that way she will not take your remarks the wrong way. Don't be scared to let her know you enjoy her company and want to get to know her.
 This is an innocent way to see if she will respond to more flirtatious behavior from you. Think of other things about her that you can compliment, such as her appearance, her dress style, her weird purse or the color of her eyes. Try to comment in such a way that you catch her interest and also make her laugh.
 Go up and talk to her! Don't be shy; girls love it when you just talk to them. Confidence is a quality almost every girl wants in a boy, so even if you are insecure, you should try your best not to let it show. Talk to her, make her laugh, tell her a funny story, or just have a simple conversation.

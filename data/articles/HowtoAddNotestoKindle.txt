The Amazon Kindle uses the QWERTY keyboard layout, which means it uses the most standard keyboard layout that begins with the letters Q, W, E, R, T and Y in the upper left side of the letters on the keyboard. This type of keyboard was invented for use with a typewriter and has since been used to describe computers, phones and tablets that have a standard keyboard rather than a standard cell phone keyboard.
 The options are "Cancel," "Clear," Save & Share" or "Save Note."

,, You must first connect your Amazon Kindle account with your social media sites. From the Home screen, press the "Menu" button. Select "Settings" and browse to find "Social Networks."

 Whether you’re using your diary to record your goals, getting over a romantic breakup, or using it to chart your travels, it can be fun to look back across your earlier pages to see the progress you’ve made. Successes can be easily forgotten. One of the best things about a diary is that you’ll have evidence of your own personal progress.Reading about the hard times will remind you that you have what it takes to get beyond them. You’ll be able to see evidence of achieving goals, working through frustrations, and overcoming adversity.
Keeping a journal can remind you to articulate steps you’ve taken to work towards your goals.
 Even if no one ever reads your diary, writing down your goals, and steps taken towards those goals, tends to keep you more focussed on doing the things you said you would do. Writing down the things you’ve done every day that lead you towards your goal, as well as the things you’ve left undone, will help you stay on track.When you start to see the tangible results of your actions, you’re more likely to want to continue to move towards your goals.
 Find a time of the day that’s best for you to sit down and write in your diary. For many people, this is first thing in the morning. It can be any time of the day when you can find a time that’s relatively undisturbed. Some people use their lunch breaks to write in their diaries. Others find it easiest to write in the 30 minutes before bed.No matter what time you find works best for you, make sure to prioritize this time. Try not to schedule other things that conflict with the time.
Even though you’re making a commitment to write every day, try to think of your writing time as a special treat that you’re giving yourself. Maybe pair your writing time with a favorite beverage or snack. If you start to think of it as a chore, you’re heading in the wrong direction.

 Don’t treat her like a trophy or a prize. Beautiful girls don’t like it when you treat them like that’s all they are — remember that she's a person with a personality and not an object for you to win or show off.

Show her that you know that she is more than just beautiful. Get to know her just like you would any other person.

Learn about her hobbies and talents.
Recognize that she has a mind and an opinion. Talk to her about what she thinks; you might learn something.
 Other people are going to think she’s beautiful, too, and some may even tell her. You can’t let this bother you or get mad unless they are rude about it.Acting jealous will make her feel like you don’t trust her. It may also cause unnecessary problems with other people. Be confident and remember that she chose to be with you.


Don’t feel like you have to say something every time someone looks at her.
If someone is disrespectful then you can stand up for her.
 Beautiful girls don’t just want you sitting there gazing at them. They want to spend time with you, get to know you, and enjoy the world with you. Talk about your common interests and do things together that you both enjoy.Plan a date exploring your neighborhood or city.
Take her to eat somewhere neither of you have been.
Play games together. You could play tag, kickball, or even a board or video game.
 You might want to spend all of your time with her, but don’t be clingy or smother her. Spending time apart gives you time to miss each other. It also gives you time to develop your own interests and have something to talk about when you are together.


Spend time with your friends and family so that those relationships stay strong.
Plan an un-date. A time where each of you plan to do something on your own.
Keep doing the things you were doing before you met her.

 After you submit the form, there may be a pause as the site connects with Xbox.com's servers. After a little while, the page will reload and a box will notify you whether the gamertag is available or not.
 Hit the guide button on your controller. Go to "Edit Profile," and attempt to change your gamertag. You'll need to enter characters through the on-screen keyboard which is burdensome, but Xbox Live will inform you whether the gamertag is available or not.

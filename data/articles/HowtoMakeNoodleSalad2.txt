 As with the recipe above, you want to use at least a few quarts so that you can cover the pasta completely. Wait until it reaches a full, rolling boil before proceeding.


Add a few pinches of salt to the water for flavor and to get the water slightly hotter.You can also pour in a dash of olive oil to keep the noodles from sticking to each other.
 Add the dry spaghetti to the water carefully. If it is too long, you can break it in half to get it to fit in the pot.


Cook according to package directions. Use the shortest recommended cooking time to leave your pasta slightly firm (or al dente).
 Carefully pour the al dente pasta into a strainer in the sink. Rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. Let the water drain out for a few minutes.
 Transfer the pasta to a large serving bowl. Pour in the dressing and stir to coat the pasta completely.
 Dice all of the remaining ingredients into 1/4 inch pieces. Add them to the bowl with the pasta. Toss to combine, adding a little more dressing if the dish seems too dry.
 This dish is meant to be served cold, making it a great summer salad. It will keep up to a week in the refrigerator in a covered container.


Congratulations mdash; your salad is ready to eat. If you'd like, you can also add croutons, shaved Parmesan cheese, bacon bits, Genoa salami, or any other ingredients you think would pair well with its Italian flavors.

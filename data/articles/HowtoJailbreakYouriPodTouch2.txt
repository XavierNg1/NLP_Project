Absinthe is one of the easiest to use programs for iOS 5.1.1 jailbreaking.

They also offer a 5.01 jailbreak that follows the same steps.

 While the device is off, hold the Power button for 3 seconds. After 3 seconds, continue holding the Power button and hold the Home button for 10 seconds.

 To turn your jailbreak into a fully untethered jailbreak, you will need to download Rocky Raccoon from Cydia. This will allow you to turn your device on without needing a connection to your computer.

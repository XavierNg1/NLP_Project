 Get a tank top or camisole. The stretchier the fabric, the better.
 Use a seam ripper to remove the side seams up to about 4" below the armpit. Then, cut the back panel below this line, leaving the front panel intact., Cut a single line down the center of the front panel, from the hem until about 2" from the neckline.
 Place your arms through the arm holes, crisscross the sides of the front panels, and then tie the ends behind you.
 You can buy bottoms to match your top (many stores sell them separately) or you can follow the teekini instructions in the previous section to make your own bottoms.
 You're done! Put on your new bikini and enjoy the sun!

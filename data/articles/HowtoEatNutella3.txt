 Use Nutella to spice up your favorite cookie recipe, or try these Nutella inspired cookies using hazelnut extract and cocoa.


If you are using Nutella in an existing recipe, be mindful of the additional fat being incorporated into the cookie dough. Try replacing some of the butter with Nutella. For example, if you plan on adding 1/4 cup of Nutella to a recipe that calls for 1 cup of butter, try using 3/4 cup of butter instead.
Once the cookie dough is fully mixed, you can gently stir in a spoonful of Nutella to create a Nutella swirl.Nutella can also be used as a frosting for sugar cookies.
 Spread a layer of banana bread dough in the bottom of a loaf pan. Then, using a spatula or the edge of a wooden spoon, spread a layer of Nutella on top of the dough and swirl it throughout making an ’S’ shape. Alternate layering dough and Nutella, swirling after each addition of Nutella.
 For a nice hazelnut flavored brownie, try adding Nutella to the dough.


Add Nutella with the other “wet” ingredients (butter, sugar, eggs) and fully incorporate.
As with the cookies, be mindful of the added fat!
Try swirling Nutella through the brownie batter instead.
 These s'mores technically aren't "baked," but they are an excellent way to use Nutella.


Replace the chocolate bar normally used in s'mores by spreading Nutella on one side of a Graham cracker. Grab another cracker and spread marshmallow fluff on it to avoid melting marshmallows over a campfire. A wonderful way to get your s'mores fix indoors.

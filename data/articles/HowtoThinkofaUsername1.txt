 In a lot of cases, your username only appears to you as the account holder. However, if you are creating an account on an online forum, a shared account, or are creating a username in a work environment, it is important to remember that the other users in your community will be able to see your username.;
, While a complicated username can be great for privacy reasons, it is important to remember that you will most likely need to recall this information on a regular basis.
 Some websites require your username to meet specific guidelines, like a capital letter and at least two instances of numbers or symbols. Make sure you meet these requirements when designing your username.
 It is incredibly important to make sure that your username will be appropriate in the future because you may be using it for a long time. For instance, a username that you find appropriate as a student or young adult may not be appropriate when you enter the workforce.
 In a lot of situations it is important to maintain anonymity, especially when posting to forums and comment sections on the internet. You probably don't want that comment you left on YouTube to lead to someone messaging you through Facebook!

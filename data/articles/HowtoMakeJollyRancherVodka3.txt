 Leave the bottles undisturbed for a few hours until the candies completely dissolve. This may take anywhere between 8 to 20 hours.
 You can freeze the bottles as you would any vodka—–not only will doing this make it more refreshing, it'll also slow down any ice melt when you use it for a mixed drink.

Make sure that the candies are completely dissolved since freezing slows down any dissolving processes. Freezing vodkas in general is also the best method for storing the spirit.
The drinks will keep in the cabinet for a few months.
 Serve as is or add to cocktails. If adding a garnish, try to use a garnish with a complementary flavor.

 First of all, to score in roller derby you need to be the Jammer. This means you have the helmet cover with the star on it.
 When the jam starts, the jammers from each team will fight their way through the pack of blockers. This is called the initial pass and no points are awarded. The first one out of the pack is awarded "lead jam" - this doesn't get you any more points, it just means you can end the jam whenever you feel like it., The jammer receives one point for every opposing blockers' hips she passes.The jammer won't lose the point if a blocker she just passed gets in front of her again., This goes until the lead jammer calls off the jam, or the jam has gone for the full 2 minutes.

 Cranberry juice is usually tart, so this will help sweeten the cocktail. Don't worry if the cotton candy reaches the top of the glass. It will disappear once you add the liquids, and leave behind a sweet taste.
 This will help chill the ingredients.
 If you aren't fond of cranberry juice, you can use another type of juice, such as grape or even orange.
 This will mix everything together, as well as chill it.
 The cotton candy will "magically" disappear.
 If it won't stay still, spear it onto a cocktail stick, and place the stick into the martini.

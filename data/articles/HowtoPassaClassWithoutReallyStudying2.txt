 Make sure to attend every class, lab or discussion, even if it is not required. If you skip a class, you may miss out on important information, which is something you cannot afford if you do not plan on studying much.For example, during class, your teacher may give hints about what material will be on the test.
Additionally, by attending optional labs or class discussions, you may be able to get some one-on-one time with your teacher. Use this time to ask your teacher questions about class materials, tests and even extra-credit opportunities.
 Compare your notes with one or two other students in the class who also pay attention, take good notes and ask questions. Discuss discrepancies in your notes and abstract topics to deepen your understanding of the course material.Discussing things out loud will also help you create associations between your personal experiences and the course material, which will help you remember important ideas on exam day better.
 Whenever your teacher puts you and your classmates into groups to discuss topics, make sure to take advantage of this time to work out complex ideas. Additionally, when your teacher asks the class questions, try to answer them even if you are unsure of the answer. This way, you can test your knowledge to see what you think you know and what you actually know., Don’t forget to introduce yourself to your teacher. Let your teacher know what you hope to learn from the class. Also ask your teacher about their teaching style. This will help you prepare for class and take better notes during class.Make sure to use your teacher’s office hours, or to speak with them after class if they don’t have office hours. Use this time to clarify concepts, ask for feedback on your notes (or essays and exams), and to discuss topics of interest.
Alternatively, meet and talk with the teaching assistant (TA) if you are uncomfortable with or intimidated by talking to your teacher.

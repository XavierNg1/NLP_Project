 When first riding a horse and teaching it to respond to cues, pick a less stressful area away from sensitive objects. Desensitizing will be much easier with a horse that responds to cues such as your voice, leg movements, and reins.
 If possible, ride along with a more experienced, calmer horse that can pass the "scary" objects without difficulty. The more skittish horse will often take cues from nearby horses, and reevaluate whether the objects are actually a threat.
 Plan your route so you'll ride past stressful areas such as loud roads or cow fields on your way back home. If you spook the horse near the beginning of the ride, the experience will be more difficult and unpleasant for both you and the horse.
 Do not allow the horse to increase its speed to pass by the objects. Desensitization comes from repeat exposure in ordinary conditions, so the horse eventually realizes there is no real threat.
 It may take many rides and a great deal of patience before the horse is fully desensitized to the objects. Smaller signs of progress are usually visible along the way, however. Praise and reward the horse whenever it manages to stay calm, or calmer than usual, near the scary object.
 If the horse is becoming difficult to control and panicked, dismount and walk the horse past the scary objects. Use this as a last resort only, as the goal is to get the horse to calm down in ordinary circumstances. If this occurs often, try to find a riding route that keeps the horse further away from the scary objects, but still within visible range.
 If a horse spends more time outdoors, it will encounter more loud noises and unexpected objects. Even when not focusing on the desensitization training, exposing the horse to more of these stimuli in "real world" situations will help desensitize the horse.

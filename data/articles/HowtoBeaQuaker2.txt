 Seek a Quaker worship center or faith-based community in your area. Be open to suggestions, and feel at liberty to try more than one. Decide whether you want to join a “programmed” Quaker meeting, led by a pastor or a non-pastoral one; one that is group-centered. In the meeting, observe as much as you can about how Quakers pray, meditate and worship.
 State in your letter to the clerk of the Quaker congregation why you made the decision to become a Quaker, as well as what you’re prepared to do to honor the faith. In your letter, ask the clerk about the membership process. Follow up with the clerk after you’ve turned in your letter. Be persistent and friendly, as Quakers are typically reserved, and may not approach you first about your decision to become a Quaker.
 Join in silent waiting during the Quaker worship service by standing in silence with your group of fellow Quakers. Expect that one or more people will feel moved by the Spirit to break the silence and share what they believe has been placed on their heart, or spoken into them. It’s okay not to contribute or feel the need to talk, but do make sure you’re aware and respect the silence.

 You probably have to exhaust whatever remedies are provided for in your CC&Rs before you can complain to a state or local agency.Read your CC&Rs and follow the complaint process.
 You can find the relevant office by searching “your state” and “homeowners association complaint” on the Internet. For example, Nevada’s Department of Business and Industry handles complaints against HOAs.In some states, county agencies might handle complaints against HOAs.If you don’t see a state office, check your county.
 Your state might have a complaint form that you can print out or download.Be sure to fill it out neatly by printing with black ink. Each form is different, but they generally will ask for the following:your name and unit number
the complainant (if this person is not you)
your mailing address and phone number
the name of the association and its location
information about the HOA, such as the president and the property manager
your reasons for complaining

, You may need the form notarized, which means you should find a notary public and sign in front of them.You can find notaries at the courthouse, in your town office, or at most large banks.


Be sure to take acceptable forms of identification to show the notary. Typically, a valid state-issued ID or a valid passport is sufficient.
 Mail the complaint form to the address provided. Be sure to include a copy of the letter that you sent to the HOA. Mail the entire complaint certified mail, return receipt requested and keep a copy for your records.

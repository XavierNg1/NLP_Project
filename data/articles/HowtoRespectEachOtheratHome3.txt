 Not keeping common areas and your own space clean is usually a big problem among roommates. Not only is it disrespectful, but it shows your roommate you expect them to clean up after you. This is often a huge cause of conflict among people who live together.


Always clean up after yourself when you use the bathroom, including toothpaste and hair in the sink. Additionally, tidy up the kitchen after you cook and eat. Pick up any messes you make, and vacuum and dust often. Showing respect in this way can make your living situation that much more pleasant., Having loud guests over late shows your roommate you don’t care about their need for sleep. Avoid this issue by setting ground rules about this when you first move in together. Abide by them once they are established.


Don’t be afraid to confront your roommate if they aren’t respecting quiet time. You could say, “I’m not trying to get in the way of you spending time with your friends, but they are staying later than what we agreed on. Would you mind having them leave by the time we discussed?”
You may need to renegotiate the conditions—and your living situation—if your roommate doesn’t comply., You likely don’t want your roommate to barge into your room and use your things, so don’t do that to them. Ask before entering their space or before you borrow something. Invading your roommate's privacy is extremely disrespectful.


Put a lock on your room if you don’t trust your roommate. Although doing so shows your roommate that you don’t trust them, it’s better than having your privacy invaded. It also prevents you from having to confront your roommate about stealing, which can make your living situation extremely awkward., Come up with a plan for how you are going to pay the bills. You may suggest splitting everything down the middle or having each person responsible for certain bills. Then, pay your bills on time. Making your roommate wait for your money is disrespectful.

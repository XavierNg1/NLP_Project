 Stir the softened cream cheese together with the cool whip, then add the sugar and vanilla and stir until all ingredients are thoroughly combined.


At this point you can add several drops of food coloring if you’d like a colored frosting.
 With a spatula, spread the frosting over your desired dessert, several tablespoons at a time. Once the entire surface is covered, use the spatula to smooth out the frosting and make sure it’s evenly distributed over the surface.


You can use this frosting to top a variety of cakes and desserts, from angel food cake to cupcakes to sheet cakes.
If you like, you can use a butter knife or the spatula to create a wave-like design in the frosting.
As an alternative to using a spatula, you can spoon the frosting into a pastry bag (or a plastic storage bag with a small hole cut from one of the corners), and, with a frosting tip, squeeze frosting onto your dessert.

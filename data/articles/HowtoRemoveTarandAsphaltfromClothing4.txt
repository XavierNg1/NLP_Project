, Prewash stain removers come as a stick, a spray, or a gel.Test the prewash stain remover on a part of your clothes that won't be noticed to make sure it doesn't affect the color of your garment.
Apply the prewash stain remover directly to the stain. For sticks, rub the stain liberally with the stain remover. When using a spray stain remover, spray the stain until it is fully saturated. A gel stain remover should be applied liberally, until the stain is covered.
Let the prewash stain remover sit on the stain for a period of time. Check the bottle for instructions on how much time to let it work.
 Tar and asphalt stains are oil stains, so you need an enzyme laundry detergent to remove them.


Pour the enzyme laundry detergent directly onto the stain.
Use a towel or paper towels to tamp the stain by pressing firmly on the stain and then lifting the towel back up.
Press the stain several times with the towel, making sure to use a clean part of the towel every time you tamp., Look at the tag on the clothing to find out what temperature water it can be washed in. Wash the clothing using the enzyme laundry detergent., Allow your clothing to air dry to avoid setting any part of the stain that wasnâ€™t completely removed.


If the stain remains, repeat the steps using a dry-cleaning solvent in place of the prewash stain remover.

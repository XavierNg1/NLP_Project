, From the sample workout:


The first, fourth and seventh sets were in the top positions.
The second, fifth and eight sets were done in the middle positions.

 Do isometrics in different positions and record them accordingly in your log, for example:


Sets one, four and seven were all done in the upper third part of the pulling motion.
Set four was done in a lower position than set one and this number was written in a lower position on the graph than set one.
Set seven was done at a higher position than set one and was written in a higher position than set one.



Set six was done in the sumo fashion and "sumo" was written above "six".
Set seven was written very high in the graph and "clean shrug" was written below.

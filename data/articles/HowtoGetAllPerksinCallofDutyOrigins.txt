 The Golden Shovel is the upgraded version of the Shovel, an in-game item that a player uses to dig special items from piles of bones. To get the Golden Shovel, you need to find first gray bone piles randomly located around the Origins map.;
, Once you find these piles, approach it and have your main character interact with it. Your character will dig into the pile of bones using the Shovel.


You’ll get a random item or equipment whenever you dig bone piles.
 Continue digging bone piles until you finish digging your 30th pile, your shovel will automatically turn into the Golden Shovel.
 Move around the map/dig site and look for flaming carts scattered throughout the place.
 You can obtain the Staff of Ice by playing through the storyline of the game.
 After shooting at least three flaming carts, you’ll get the Zombie Blood power up (represented by a “blood bag”). Once you claim this power up, your character will go into Zombie Blood mode.
 Move around the site and look for red bone piles, which are similar to the gray bone piles you dug up, but this time the piles have turned red due to your Zombie Blood mode.
 Use the Golden Shovel to dig, and you’ll get an empty Perk-a-Cola bottle.
 These are located at different locations of the map. The Wunderfizz looks like gateway machine with a big sphere-shaped object mounted on its top part.
 You can only fill the bottle up with perks from the Wunderfizz vending machine.
 Continue searching red bone piles for empty Perk-a-Cola bottles and filling the bottles up with perks at the Wunderfizz vending machine until you get all 9 perks, listed below:

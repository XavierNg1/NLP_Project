 These cans can often be found at electronics stores like Radioshack or Best Buy. Compressed air is also used for clearing debris from computer parts, so look where computer parts are sold. Air is least likely to damage your jack since you donâ€™t have to put anything inside the hole other than the air., Get the air dispensing opening right up next to the jack. Some bottles come with thin tubes that stick out from the can. These may be easier for you to use since you can point the tube directly at the jack and focus the air into the small opening., Press the button on the top of the can to start dispensing air. You should only need a blast or two to loosen most debris inside the jack. Make sure all it comes out of the hole.

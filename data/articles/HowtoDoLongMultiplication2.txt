 Let's say you're multiplying 325 times 12. Write it down. One number should be right next to the other, not below it.
 Keep 325 and split up 12 into 10 and 2. The 1 is in the tens digit, so you should add a 0 afterward to keep its place, and since the 2 is in the ones place, you can just write down 2.
 Now, multiply 325 times 10. All you have to do is add a zero to the end to equal 3250.
 Now, just multiply 325 by 2. You can eyeball it and see that the answer is 650, since 300 times 2 is 600 and 25 times 2 is 50. Add up 600 and 50 to equal 650.
 Now, just add up 3250 and 650. You can do this using the good old fashioned addition method. Just write 3250 over 650 and do all the work. You'll get 3,900. Really, this is similar to doing the standard long multiplication, but splitting up a number into ones and tens allows you to do a bit more of the math in your head and to avoid multiplying and carrying too much. Either method will yield the same results, and it all depends on which one works more quickly for you.

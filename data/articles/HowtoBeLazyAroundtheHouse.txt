 Organize the jobs you are putting off into a hierarchy. If you need to both tidy your room, and complete a vital work assignment, always opt for the tidying first (even if you do just hide the mess). The satisfaction of completing an entire task will put your lazy mind at rest. The lesson here is to always leave the lengthiest jobs till last!

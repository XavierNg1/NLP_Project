 The enzymatic processes that destroy vitamins will be slowed by keeping vegetables and fruits near freezing temperatures., Riboflavin, vitamin A, and vitamin D can be destroyed by direct light., Freezing retains nutrients better than other methods of preservation such as drying, pickling, or canning.Blanch vegetables first by submersing them briefly in boiling water to stop the enzymatic changes that destroy vitamins and also to kill micro-organisms living on the surface.Add ascorbic acid to fruits to control enzymes that cause deterioration of vitamins as well as colors.If vegetables or fruits were frozen immediately after harvest, they may have more vitamins than older fresh produce at a grocery store., While drying foods in the sun or ovens causes more vitamin loss than freezing, it is less damaging than the canning process. Freeze-drying, which is a method often used for herbs and soups, preserves even more nutritional value., Canning removes many water-soluble vitamins. However, it allows for the storage of vegetables and meats at room temperature with minimal chemical preservatives. In addition, some canned foods retain vitamins. Canned fish, for example, has high levels of calcium, and canned oily fish retains its levels of omega-3 fatty acids.

 Before you set traps, one of the keys to getting rid of mice is identifying the "rodent zones," or the areas between the nest and the food source.If you've found droppings or signs of chewing (or have seen mice) in a particular area of your home, start there and narrow in on the following popular locations:


Secluded corners
Under cabinets
Between furniture
Ceiling and wall voids, especially near heat sources
Top of the basement
Crawl space
Cluttered office or desk drawers
Garages;
, You may not be dealing with a nest in your home, but rather immediately outside it. You'll want to also be aware of:


Dead fruit trees
Wall and floor voids on upper or attic floors
Beneath low-lying shrubbery
Within the wall voids of a brick foundation
Along utility lines
Beneath slab walkways or porches

, Mice typically don't run through the middle of rooms, but stick close to the walls. Placing the traps in these paths will increase the likelihood of their working.


Keep the traps out of your way to avoid accidents.

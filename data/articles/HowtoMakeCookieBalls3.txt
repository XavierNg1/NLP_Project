 Make sure that a piece of parchment paper is over the pan, so that the dough doesn't get stuck., When baking, the dough must be firm, otherwise it tends to flatten during cooking. You may need to experiment a few times before getting the ball shape working.

Sloppy dough will not keep its shape.
 Shape balls quickly; dough for baking can harden fast., Make sure the dough is tightly packed into the scoop, or it won't come out as a compacted cookie. Squeeze the lever until the dough comes out onto the plastic wrap., Take a small handful of dough and begin shaping it, very gently, with your fingers. Don't press too hard, though; it may break. Keep shaping it until you are satisfied, and transfer it to the parchment paper., If they are too close together in the oven, they will stick together, and will form one giant cookie instead of separate balls.

 Of course, you do not want to ask a string of yes or no questions like, "Is your name Sarah?" or "Hot enough for you?";
, Ask open-ended questions to keep the conversation running smoothly. Questions like, "Wow, you're a professor? What does it feel like being on the opposite end of academia?" will keep the conversation from dying too quickly. People love to talk about themselves. Giving people an "open mic," so to speak, will keep them comfortably conversing.
 It is important to know what you are talking about or what your audience is interested in when trying to present your conversation, so you need to know How it happened, what it is about, and why you explaining this.

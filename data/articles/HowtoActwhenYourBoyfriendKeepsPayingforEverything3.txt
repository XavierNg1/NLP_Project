 If you have decided that you are not okay with him paying, and you have talked about it, then the first step is to start changing the behavior. The next time you are out, offer to pay the bill. He may be paying all the time because you haven't offered to pay.Since you two have talked about it and how you feel about it, there shouldn't be any arguments. Try being lighthearted about it, keeping your tone bright and cheery.


”Nope! My turn!”
”Hey, you've covered like the last 10 meals. I'm paying tonight.”
If he takes out his wallet, ”Uh-uh, put it away mister. Tonight is on me.”

, It doesn't need to be a big deal; just let him know that you'd like to pay for yourself once in a while, starting with this bill.


An alternate way is to split the bill by items. Instead of splitting in half or for what you have ordered make an agreement to split up by parts. For example, if he pays for dinner then you pay for drinks and dessert. If you are going to the movies, he can pay for the tickets and you pay for drinks and popcorn.
 You can also take turns with who pays for what dates. This works well with friends, too. If he pays for dinner one night, the next time you go out, you pay. Then the next date you have he pays, and so on, back and forth. This is a good way to evenly split the responsibility of paying without having to do check math every time the bill comes.
 If you are uncomfortable with him paying for everything, but you can't come to an agreement about it, then just plan for dates that are very inexpensive or free.There are tons of fun, low key things you can do that are cost effective.This way, you still get to date and have fun, without the stress of figuring out who is going to pay or worrying about getting into an argument about it.


For example, you and your boyfriend could go hiking or biking at a local park, take a trip to the beach, go to a free outdoor concert in your community, or stay in for a movie night.

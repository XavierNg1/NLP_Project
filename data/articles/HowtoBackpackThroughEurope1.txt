 Make sure to consider the season you want to travel in when you are selecting your dates. June through August is peak season, which means a lot of tourists and higher prices, but nice weather and many festivals. On the other hand, November through April is low season, which means cheaper prices and fewer tourists, but colder weather.If you plan to travel in the winter, keep in mind that you will need to pack more clothes.;
, Making a to-do list is the fun part. Make a list of all the places you want to see or visit. Then narrow down your list to the places you have to see, the places you really want to see, and the places you could do without.Use maps, travel books, and online travel sites to find out about exciting or popular events and destinations.
 Do this if you plan on visiting multiple cities. Three full days will give you enough time to see the sights without feeling rushed or burnt out. However, how long you stay in each city really depends on the length of your trip.For example, if you are traveling for two weeks and you want to visit four different cities, then two full days in each city is more practical.

 In early books, Stacey has her blond hair permed. In later books she has shoulder length hair in a body wave.;
, This is a Stacey trademark. Her clothes always match, but she would not think twice about wearing clothes in, say, magenta or bright orange, or about wearing unusually patterned clothes. Extra points for New York City themes, as Stacey is from New York City.
 Stacey is type 1 diabetic, so she cannot eat sweets.


That said, do not object when people around you eat sweets. Stacey doesn't care about that.
 Don't look down your nose at people, but have an air of big-city sophistication.
 Stacey is known for having pierced ears (just one hole in each ear, though). That said, if you have a septum piercing, disguise it. Stacey tries a clip earring in the nose in one book, but then vows never to have any part of her nose pierced at all.
 Make sure that Goobaw has either no clothes at all or just a bow tie. Also make sure that the teddy bear you use is of the right size to hug and is a color that a real bear would be. This is mentioned in a special volume in the series, Stacey's Book. Stacey holds on to Goobaw when she is scared, and he goes with her when she goes to the hospital for her diabetes.
 A protractor, a ruler, or a four-function calculator would work great for this. Stacey is a math whiz, and she loves anything to do with numbers.
 Write numbers, not letters. Stacey is the treasurer of the club.

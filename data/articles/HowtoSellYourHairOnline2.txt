 It’s good to see the hair spread out, as well as in a braid. This way, you can showcase the variety of colors in your hair, as well as its thickness. Use a minimum of four photos.


Some buyers prefer to see an "after" photo of who supplied the hair to be sure the hair is genuinely from the person shown as the seller. The more the buyer is at ease, the smoother the sale, and the more money you can sell the hair for.
 Shots taken outdoors in natural light can showcase the health and texture of your hair. A measuring tape in your photo or video gives buyers a visual perspective of the length and thickness of the hair. #*If the hair is already cut, place the ponytail on a white towel or fabric alongside a measuring tape so buyers can clearly see the length, true color, texture, and health of the hair.


Comb the hair and treat it as if it is still on your head prior to taking photos, to make your item look its best.
 Use brief, concise language that really emphasizes what a good product your hair is.


Virgin, natural highlights, and thick are all words that buyers like to see.
Be very specific about the color and texture. Rather than “red, wavy hair”, say “auburn waves”. Rather than “blonde with highlights”, say “gold with strawberry blonde highlights”.

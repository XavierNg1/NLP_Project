 You are going to swim, ride and run. Therefore, each week, you should swim, bike and run. It's simplest to do each activity twice a week, saving one day for rest.


Rest is imperative. Your body needs time to heal. Don't think of it as slacking -- you're just being smart about training.
 There are several training stages that will help you reach maximum success in your triathlon training. The stages are what an athlete Builds a training program around relative to where they are in their training progress. Based on your fitness level, the stages will dictate the kind of intensity and distance that you will engage in. Individuals who are new to triathlon training should at the Base stage and go from there. The training stages include:The Base stage has increasing distance, low intensity
The Build stage has distance maxing, moving toward moderate intensity
The Peak stage has decreasing distance, moving toward high peak intensity
The Race stage has decreasing distance, decreasing intensity from high toward moderate
The Taper stage has decreasing distance, decreasing intensity from moderate to low

There is some taper pre- and post-race, depending on the racing schedule.
 Different types of triathlons require different training schedules and timelines. Your timeline is also dependent on your fitness level and personal lifestyle (for example, if you work a lot or you have a family to care for).


Sprint distances may take 4-6 weeks to train for, while Olympic distances may take 3-6 months.
If you are training for a 70.3 or 140.6 race, be sure to adopt the training stages (base through taper) to ensure that you train properly and safely. Training for these can take 6 months to a year.
 Swimming often constitutes 10-20% of a race, biking often constitutes 40-50% of a race, and running often constitutes 20-30% of a race. When you're training, keep this in mind.


Also, think about the type of race you're running. What kind of water will you be in? Are you biking and running on hills? What kind of terrain? If you can train in a similar state, the race will be a lot less surprising.
 A brick is where you do two disciplines back to back. An example of a brick session is a 45-minute cycle ride followed by a 15- to 20-minute run. This gets you used to changing muscle groups.


Even if you can swim like a fish, run like you're being chased by wolves, and cycle like there's no tomorrow, if you can't do them back to back, you won’t do well in a triathlon. Doing brick sessions will teach your body how to cope when the actual race comes around.
You can change what you’re doing based on the day of the week; you may want to devote one day to swimming, one day to running, one day to biking, one day to stretching, one day to rest, then two days to brick sessions that combine the types of exercise.
 These programs generally accept all levels of skill in the water. Having access to a pro instructor certainly never hurts.


Ask your swim coach where he/she would train and what open water is available for you to practice in. Pools are good, but they're just not the same as a lake or river.
If possible, swim in squares in the pool or do not push off of the walls; you won’t have the chance to rest ever 25 yards when you are in the open water.
Becoming a proficient swimmer will help your triathlon performance overall, but keep in mind that the swim is the shortest (and some would say least significant) portion of the triathlon.
 You may spend a lot of your training time working on the sports one at a time, but you do not want your actual triathlon race to be the first time you bike, swim, and run all at the same time. You can work on transitions ahead of time by doing practice triathlons.


It’s also a good idea to eat and drink while you are training. You can get a snack in after your swim and before your run. Stay hydrated and be sure to keep up your carbs while you are in training.
 This is usually around a ~700 meter (765 yard) swim, ~15 mile (24 km) bike and a 5K (3.1 mi) run. You do not need to set a land-speed record, just use the races as a learning experience. You can use sprint races as a building block for longer races (international, half-ironman, and ironman), or you can choose to focus on sprint races. But you need to race to put all the training together.


Sprints are a good jumping off point. You can never start at the top of the ladder for anything, so a smaller triathlon is a good place to begin. It's also safest for your body.
 In the off-season, you can do a lot of long, steady distance work that will build a strong network of capillaries in your legs that will serve you well in the summer during race season.


As soon as you can, get outside. You'll want to be able to get accustomed to the handle of the bike. Cycling outside is a very different experience than cycling indoors, stationery.

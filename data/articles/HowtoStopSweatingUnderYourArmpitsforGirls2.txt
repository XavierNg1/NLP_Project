 As the name suggests, antiperspirants are meant to avoid sweating (perspiring). Antiperspirants are widely available, and most deodorants sold today contain an antiperspirant.


Typically, these products come in different strengths. It is best to start with the lowest strength product. If that doesn’t solve your sweating problem, then try the next strength level.Antiperspirants work by creating a coagulant that clogs the pores., The antiperspirant solution will be diluted if you sweat shortly after using it. At night, you are moving around less, and less likely to sweat., This will help your skin from becoming irritated, and will also help the antiperspirant to work better (since it works best if it does not become diluted)., It may take time for the antiperspirant to clog the pores. If the product is not working after only a few days, don’t worry, the product may just need a few more days., In addition to an antiperspirant, you can also apply a deodorant. When sweat interacts with bacteria on the skin, it becomes odorous. Deodorant kills the bacteria to prevent this odor. Fragrance is commonly added to mask any smell that might occur.Sometimes antiperspirants may also include a deodorant and vice versa. Read the label of your current antiperspirant or deodorant carefully to check.

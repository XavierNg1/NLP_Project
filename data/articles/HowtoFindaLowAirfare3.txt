 Southwest offers daily “Ding” deals that pop up on your computer (announced by an audible “ding”, thus the name) that can save a few bucks off their already low fares at http://www.southwest.com/ding. Frontier Airlines has begun sending out similar fares by email. In both cases, the fares expire the same day they’re announced but they’re often good for travel far into the future. Frontier doesn't list its excellent weekend fares anywhere but on their own site at flyfrontier.com.

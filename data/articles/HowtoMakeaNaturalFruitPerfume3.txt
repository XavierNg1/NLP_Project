 A tincture is an herbal preparation in which the oils of a plant are extracted into a solvent. To create your own tincture, take fresh, frozen or dried elderberries and remove the stems.Take a quart jar with a tight fitting lid and fill it 2/3 of the way full of the elderberries.
Fill the rest of the jar with Everclear grain alcohol and store the mixture in a cool, dry place. Shake the mixture several times a week and wait 6 weeks for the mixture to extract.After 6 weeks, drain the mixture and store it in a glass bottle. Keep the bottle in a cool, dark place and your tincture will last for years to come.
 In a small glass vial, combine 3 drops of the tincture with 3 drops of mandarin essential oil, 3 drops lime essential oil and 3 drops grapefruit essential oil.For a fuller aroma, add 3 drops of vanilla essential oil as well.
3 drops is the recommended amount for this recipe, but you can increase or decrease the amount of each essential oil, depending on your own personal preferences.
 Fill the rest of the glass vial with your carrier oil of choice. Shake or roll the vial to stir the perfume. If you don't have a carrier oil, you can also experiment with carrier alcohols.Carrier alcohols include other high proof alcohols, like Bacardi 151 rum.
You can also use vinegar or rubbing alcohol as a carrier alcohol.
 Apply drops of the perfume behind your ears and on the backs of your wrists. Feel free to play around with the recipe until you find a scent that works for you.For a stronger citrus scent, increase the amount of essential oils you use.
For a more berry-filled scent, add more of your tincture to your mixture.

 Dogs often paw as a means to get attention or food. If your dog is pawing, a good way to prevent is to encourage them to engage in other behaviors to gain attention. If your dog knows any tricks or commands, have your dog engage in these behaviors when it paws.For example, your dog may paw when it wants attention. Each time you see your dog pawing, say, "Sit!" Do not reward your dog with attention until it sits. This way, your dog will learn to sit quietly and wait for attention instead of pawing.;
, Pawing can also be converted into a trick. If a dog associates the pawing behavior with the command, "Shake," it will eventually learn only to paw when it hears that command.Hold your hand in front of your dog and say "Shake." Wait for your dog to paw at your hand and then reward it with a treat and praise. Repeat this several times a day until your dog understands to paw when it hears, "Shake."
After your dog learns the "shake" command, only reward your dog with attention or food when it paws in response to the command. Eventually, your dog will learn pawing is only appropriate when you ask it to shake.
 Whichever behavior you choose to encourage, be consistent. Dogs learn best with consistent training over time. Make sure to only reward your dog with treats or praise when it engages in the behavior you want instead of pawing. If you notice pawing at any other times, ignore the behavior and do not reward your dog. Most dogs paw because they want attention or food. If you engage with them while they're pawing, they will continue the behavior.For example, if you want your dog to sit when it wants food instead of pawing, do not feed your dog until it sits. If your dog is pawing, patiently command your dog to sit and only give it food when it obeys.

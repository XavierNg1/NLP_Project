 Consider how something might still be useful even after it has fulfilled its original purpose. Many consumer products are designed to be thrown away after a single use â€“ but with a bit of care, you can learn to break the cycle.


Look for ways to recycle items into home decor: turn old boots into planter pots, sew clothing into blankets, and use old wine bottles as candle holders.
Think about how you can repurpose a "used" item into something functional. Wash out old condiment jars and use them for drinking or storage; use old clothes as cleaning rags; and consider rinsing out slightly-used Ziploc bags for a second use., You can "recycle" organic matter (paper, leftovers, coffee grounds) at home by mulching it together into a compost pit or compost bin. As the food waste decays, it will gradually turn into soil with the help of worms or other insects. You can spread the composted soil onto your garden, or you can donate it to a local farmer!

, Think carefully before you throw something away. Even if you don't know how you yourself will reuse an item, there is a chance that someone else will be able to use it. Consider taking loads of old clothes, media, and household ephemera down to a local Goodwill or community thrift store.


Try using community websites like Craigslist and Freecycle to find homes for unused items that you want to sell or give away. Before you throw something away, ask your friends, your family, and your neighbors if they can use it.Most Goodwill centers feature a drop-off point where you can bring your still-usable things, no questions asked. Look around: there may be other thrift stores or distribution centers in your area that offer a similar service.

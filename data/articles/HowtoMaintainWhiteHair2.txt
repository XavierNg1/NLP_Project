 Do not mix anything into the bleach other than what is instructed with the directions of your bleach.
 All bleach is caustic and can damage your skin leaving your fingers blistered, very sore, dry and discoloured. The bleach used in this process removes melanin so it will leave your fingers white, but the colour of your skin will return as your skin regenerates skin cells.

2 tablespoons of soy sauce
1 teaspoons of salt
1 teaspoon of sugar
1/4 teaspoon of ground pepper

You can garnish the sauce with 1 tablespoon of sliced green onion or 1/2 teaspoon of chili flakes. Serve the sauce immediately.You can refrigerate and serve this sauce later. Keep in mind that the sauce will become spicier as the onion, chilies and garlic infuse it.

 You can use the Equation Editor to apply the mathematical overline accent to your text. The overline effect produced is slightly different than the field code function. You cannot select your text and then apply the equation, you will have to enter the text after creating the equation.


To insert an equation, click the Insert tab. Click the Equation button in the Symbols section. If you are using Word 2003 or XP, click Insert → Object → Microsoft Equation 3.0.
 Before typing your text, add the accent. Click the Accents button in your Design section. There are actually to slightly different options you can pick from if you want an overline over your test. You can choose either the Bar, located in the Accents section, or the Overbar, located in the Over bars and Under bars section. Choose one and a small dotted box will appear in your formula field.
 Click the small dotted box and begin entering your test. You will see the overline effect applied immediately as you type. When you are finished, click outside of the formula field.
 If you can't get the overline to appear, chances are you didn't have the small dotted box selected when you entered your text. You must select it in order to type with the overline effect. Any text outside of the box will not be affected.

 You do not need a special type of thread. Use white thread because its easier to see the hair you thread out.;
, This does not need to be exact. You can experiment with different lengths as you become more comfortable with the technique.
 A simple knot will suffice as long as the ends don't come apart (here's a quick one- remember the first knot you make when tying your shoelaces? just make that about 2-3 times with the two ends of the thread).
 The wound bit now lies in the center of the circle.
 Push the wound portion towards one hand by widening the fingers of one hand and simultaneously closing the fingers of the other hand (if you're doing this right, your hands will appear to be having a respectful, mock "conversation" with each other. When one hand "talks" the other will be quiet and vice versa).
 Usually, a smaller length of thread is easier to work with when you are still practicing your hand movements.
 My suggestion would be to practice on your leg since most people have hair on their legs that can be seen/reached easily.
, Let the wound part be one end of the hair, and the thread from the other side should be on both sides of the hair you want to remove.
 It will then lift the hair from the root as it moves back and forth.
 This will require lots of practice!

,, Remember, your eyebrows are less forgiving of errors than any other parts of your body.

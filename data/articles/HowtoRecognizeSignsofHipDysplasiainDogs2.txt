 If your puppy has hip dysplasia, you may begin to see signs of the condition as early as 5 to 10 months of age. In particular, you may notice that your puppy has a harder time moving around that they other puppies. He may:


Take shorter steps or have less of a stride.
Hold his back legs together and use his front legs more so that he can hop with his back legs, much like a bunny.
 While playing might be fine for your puppy, you should still keep an eye on him to see how he handles resting after play. A pup that has hip dysplasia will be more inclined to lie down for longer, and may act like he doesn’t want to get up after he has rested. This is because his hips become stiff when resting after activity., If your pup has hip dysplasia, he will most likely avoid jumping up on couches, your lap, etc. This is because his back legs are not as strong as his front legs, and it could hurt him to exert enough force on his back legs to help himself jump up on to things.


Pat the couch next to you. If your puppy looks like he wants to jump up but doesn’t, or tries to and then whines in pain, he may have hip dysplasia.
 As mentioned above, puppies and young dogs who have hip dysplasia have a harder time moving around than other dogs. This might lead to your dog developing an unsteady walk that could be described as:


Wobbling.
Weaving.
Tipping over a lot.
 Puppies and young dogs with hip dysplasia tend to stand with their rear legs slightly forward, so that their front legs can support more of their weight. This can lead to their forearms being much more developed than their hind legs.When your puppy is standing:


Check to see if his hind legs are pressed slightly forward.
Feel his forearms, which may be muscular, compared to his hind legs, which might feel bony.

 If your doctor agrees that you have a kneecap dislocation, she will likely perform a procedure called a “reduction,” which will slide your kneecap back into place.The doctor will likely give you pain medication before manipulating your knee to minimize the discomfort. Generally she will follow this procedure with an x-ray to make sure everything is in the correct place.
Again, it’s important to not try this at home as it is difficult to figure out which injuries need surgery or specialized treatments, and further damage can occur if this is not done correctly.
 If you have a rare type of dislocation or additional injuries, your doctor may need to consult an orthopedic surgeon (a specialist surgeon who treats bony injuries) to determine whether surgical intervention is necessary.

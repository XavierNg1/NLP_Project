 Android does not natively support the EML format. The only way to open EML files on your Android device is to install an app.EML Reader FREE is one of the more highly-rated EML reader apps available, though there are others to choose from if you wish. Simply search "eml reader" in the Google Play Store.
 There are several ways you may open an EML file, depending on how you got it.


If you received an EML file as an attachment, open the email containing it in your Gmail or Mail app and then tap the EML attachment.
If you downloaded the EML file from a website, use a File Manager app to open your Download folder, or open the EML Reader FREE app to navigate through your files.
 When you try to open the EML file, you will be prompted to select an app. EML Reader Free should appear on the list. Tap "Always" to associate EML files with your new reader.
 EML Reader FREE will break the EML file up into its different parts, including From/To, Date, Subject, Text, HTML, and Attachments.


The "Text" section contains the body of the EML file.
The "HTML" section will display the message in its original formatting.
 At the bottom of the display, you'll see a list of attachments. These are all of the images that were used in creating the HTML message, as well as any files that weren't attached to the message.


When you press and hold an attachment, a new menu will appear. Select "Open" and then an app that can read that file type. You can also select "Save" to extract the file from the EML file and place it in the same folder.

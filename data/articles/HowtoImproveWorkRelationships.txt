 There are several things you should look for in the way that you work: Identifying your strengths and weaknesses might help you understand why your work relationship with your colleagues is suffering.


What are your strengths (for example, are you a hard worker who doesn't stop until the job is done)?
What are your weaknesses (for example, do you usually leave things until the last minute)?;
, This might not be very obvious, since most people will choose not to tell you what it is that bothers them about your working style. This will help narrow the list of people you need to improve your relationship with.
 This might be a hard step to take if you had a conflict with this person, but you should not hesitate to address the issue directly with the person. As long as you approach them in a friendly, non-threatening way, you might be able to resolve the problem without conflict. If you are simply looking to improve your relationship with your colleagues, most people will welcome your conversation because they will see it as an effort to improve your interpersonal skills. They will likely offer constructive feedback on what you are doing well, and how you can improve.
 This doesn't need to be something major - it can be as simple as bringing them a coffee or small snack, or helping them out when they need it. If your coworkers see that you are willing to go out of your way to do something nice for them, they will likely be more trusting and supportive of you, and will want to repay the favour in the future.

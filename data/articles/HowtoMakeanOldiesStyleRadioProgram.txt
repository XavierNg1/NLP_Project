 Is this a western? A spy story? What is the name of the main character? Where did he/she come from? Back stories are useful in TV, comics, radio- anything that is serialized, because they make a good first episode, and can be referenced later on to fill out a short-ish episode.;
, Does your lead have a romantic interest? How about a sidekick? Is there a main antagonist? You should probably come up with back stories for these too; even if you never reference them, they'll help with your characterization.
 Based on the premise and the characters, what do you imagine them doing? You could briefly tell the backstory of you main character, or write about how they met the main antagonist, etc. Remember that you are introducing the characters for the first time; a listener can't read your mind. This should be done before you choose any actors for two reasons:


You can get people interested in acting for you by showing them the script.
You may lose the interest of your actors while they wait for something to act in.
 Tell them a little about the premise and all of the available characters.
 Have people read from the script. Think about who the characters are, and which of your friends sound most like them. Remember: This is audio only. You are not casting based on looks.
, Actors who aren't in the scene should provide sound effects, like slamming doors, applause, crowd noises, gunshots, etc. The only exception is footsteps; actors should do this for their own characters. (Dropping a heavy book on a tabletop makes a good gunshot.)

, An example of this would be bird sounds or crowd chatter.
 Actual radio is a little un-realistic, although you can always send a tape to a station if you want. You could also set up an internet radio station- I think there's an wikihow article on how to do that.

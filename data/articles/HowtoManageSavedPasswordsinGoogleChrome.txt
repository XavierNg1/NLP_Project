, One is for “Enable Autofill to fill out web forms in a single click,” and the second one is for “Offer to save your web passwords.”

, The second option under “Passwords and Forms” is an offer to save your passwords for other websites. If you want this option enabled, click on the tick box to check it. If it is already checked and you want it deactivated, just uncheck the box.

 Neutral tones include shades of white, gray, black, and some browns. They blend in with most surroundings and make it easier for homeowners and interior designers to change out furniture later.
 White on the ceiling reflects light and reduces shadows, making a room look more open. White on walls can also open a room and will make it look neutral in the process. This hue provides you with the greatest amount of versatility when it comes to room accessories.
 These dark hues can camouflage ductwork and direct the eye downward, back into the room. Avoid putting these colors on the walls, however, since they tend to seem threatening and over dramatic.
 Gray adds a little bit of drama without becoming too intense. The hue can also inspire creativity.
 Brown has a warm, durable ambiance. Mid-tones and dark hues are especially warm, while soft hues feel natural and neutral.

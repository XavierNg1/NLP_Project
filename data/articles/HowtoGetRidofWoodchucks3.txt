 For harassment to be an effective means of wildlife control, it must be continuous and concentrated.









Fill burrow holes and block any spots that give woodchucks access to their holes. You may have to refill the holes several times before woodchucks give up and move on.
Spread thick molasses or another sticky substance around burrow entrances. Woodchucks will go to great lengths to avoid getting sticky things on their bodies. Reapply the substance after every rain.
Set up motion-activated sprinklers that blast the groundhogs with water. Move the sprinklers around periodically so they do not learn how to avoid them.
 This is the same netting you'd use to keep birds off a berry tree. Leave some extra sticking up out of the ground.









Add a heavy rock on top of the hole to hold the netting and fill the entrance. Groundhogs will come back again and again because they smell previous groundhog urine in the area. They will try to repeatedly try to open the hole up.
If you fill the hole up by adding the netting, they'll get it tangled in their feet when they try to re-dig the hole.This does not hurt the animal because they will chew off anything that gets wrapped around their paw. It does get them aggravated to the point where they will leave and not come back.

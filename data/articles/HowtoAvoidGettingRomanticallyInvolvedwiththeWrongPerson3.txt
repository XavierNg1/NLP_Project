 Don’t sacrifice your own happiness for someone else. Your happiness is paramount, and while you may be tempted to put other people’s lives over yours, keep in mind that romance should not detract from the rest of your life. Romantic relationships should, and can be physically, emotionally, and spiritually rewarding without being a detriment to the other aspects of your life.


If being romantically involved with someone means putting your life on hold, reevaluate the relationship.
 Instead of waiting for someone to come to you, seek people who fit your criteria. After you determine what would be good in a romantic relationship, seek those people out in social situations.


You can write down a check-list of ideal qualities in a romantic relationship and strive for them.For example, perhaps you want someone who loves to read, enjoys spending time in nature, and who listens to you.
 Don’t be desperate for romance. Desperation often leads people to do things they wouldn’t normally do. In addition, desperation can actually make you less attractive to the people around you.Do not get obsessed with the idea of being romantically involved with someone to the point where you lose all selectivity when looking for someone.
If you feel impatient, try to remind yourself that you are waiting for the right person and it will be worth the wait.
 Don’t neglect your career for romance. If romance is on your mind, it may be hard to concentrate on other things, but it’s important to keep your own personal priorities and goals in mind. Determine what you want to do in your life other than your romantic or social relationships, and make sure to strive for those goals.


You can balance romance and career or school, just make sure that you’re allocating enough time in both to make it rewarding.

 This gets blood into the area's connective tissue and muscle, better preparing it for a good session of lifting weights. It would benefit you even further to do a couple light sets of each movement you're about to perform- with weight that will allow you to do 20+ reps with no struggle. This warms up the connective and muscle tissue very effectively.;
, This means not using momentum to move the weight through its normal range of motion. Not only will you get better results and learn to "feel" the muscle contracting and stretching, it is much safer. Momentum tears muscles. Do not let this be you.
 Muscles are stretched during the eccentric phase, forcing them to enlarge and get stronger. The same goes for the connective tissues.
 You can start slowly by performing a circuit routine or full-body routine, for example a set of ten repetitions of squats, resting for 2 minutes then doing a set of bench presses. Think of muscle as a multi-functional armour for our internal organs and skeletons- it protects both and does a very good job. In addition it burns fat around the clock making you LEANER.
Weight training is stressful, and much like your skin reacting to the sun. The skin creates pigment to protect from UV rays passing. Weight training creates stress, the body reacts to this stress by creating more muscle to protect against the trauma of the weights. The joints and supportive tissues are also strengthened, making them more prepared to handle stressful loads as well.
 Inhale on the resistance phase and exhale on the push phase. You need more 02 rich blood to push or pull the weight back to the starting position for another rep.

 You should pull slightly forward while walking towards your horse's neck. It took me 3 months to train my horse, and got Reserve Champion that year. We started by teaching the horse how to cross the legs over and not worry about the hind. To push the shoulder over use a hand or spur to push it. As you get better walk your horse out of a pivot that they move their hind legs. Start at small portions of the pivot to earn your trust in the horse that they know what they are supposed to do.

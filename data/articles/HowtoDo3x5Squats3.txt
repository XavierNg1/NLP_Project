 You want to make sure weight training is safe for you given your current fitness level. Make an appointment with your doctor to talk over weight training to find a safe routine for you given your current health. This is especially important if you have any underlying medical issues.
 It may be a good idea to talk to a trainer in your gym or watch videos online of people doing squats when you're starting out. It can take awhile to get the hang of the movements. If you're using improper technique, this can cause strain or injury.If you feel very sore after doing squats, you may be using improper techniques. Try consulting a trainer at your gym for guidance.
 Squats are a form of weight training. It's best to engage in weight training only two to three days a week. You should always have rest days in between. Do not do squats two days in a row, as this can cause injury.If you have very intense workouts, that incorporate intense aerobics in addition to squats, only opt for light activity on rest days. Go for brief walks, for example, but try to take it easy overall.If you only engage in light exercise, you can do more intense workouts on weight training rest days. For example, you can play sports outdoors or go for a light jog.
 You may not be able to complete a full three by five routine at first, especially if you're new to weight training. If you feel very sore or strained during a routine, stop. You should pay attention to your body's signals.If you feel pain when squatting, this is not normal. You should stop if you feel pain and rest for a day before trying again.

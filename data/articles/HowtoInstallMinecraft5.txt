 If you want to create a world that you and all of your friends can play on, you may want to consider setting up a Minecraft server. You can do this on a spare computer in your house, or you can rent a server that is always available and can handle a lot of players at once.
 Want to change up your vanilla Minecraft experience? There are thousands of mods available for Minecraft, and also many mods available for Minecraft PE (though these require a fair amount more work to get).

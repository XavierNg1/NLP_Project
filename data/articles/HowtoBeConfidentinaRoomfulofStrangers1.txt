 You may be focusing on what others are thinking about you, or you may worry that others are constantly judging you. Every time a thought like this pops up in your head, force yourself to forget it. Remind yourself quietly that people do not think that way about you and that they are just as nervous as you are., Deep breathing can help you relax both before and during social encounters. Sit straight and breathe deeply into your lungs to calm your nerves. If you feel anxiety surfacing, focus on your inhalations and exhalations., The day of the event, warm up by talking to people everywhere you go. If you order coffee, start a conversation with the barista. Ask the bus driver how they are feeling. Call a family member or old friend to have a conversation. This can help you prepare for the larger gathering., Before you go to the event, try to imagine what the situation will be like. Think of what kind of conversations you might have. Practice approaching people in your mind to prepare for the situation. This can remove much of the fear around talking to strangers.For example, if you are going to a professional conference, you might discuss your work, presentations, the catering, or training. You may only know a few coworkers.
If you are going to a party, you may know several people already. You might discuss the music, recent holidays, or fun stories about mutual friends.

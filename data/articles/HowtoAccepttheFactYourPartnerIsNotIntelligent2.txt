 Being in love may not literally be like wearing rose colored glasses, but psychological research suggests it can be beneficial to put your metaphorical rose colored glasses back on and idealize your relationship and what attracted you to your partner in the first place. Couples who focus on the positive parts of their relationships and characteristics of their partners are happier and less likely to be divorced., Instead of viewing your partner’s lack of knowledge on a subject you’re passionate about as a negative, view this as an opportunity to share your knowledge. Encourage your partner’s interests, and take time to help them learn more., Even if your partner is less intelligent than you are, finding someone who respects and encourages you will lead to more happiness than selecting a partner who is equally intelligent. Research shows that differing levels of intelligence between partners has little impact on their long term happiness, especially compared with factors like trust and respect., We alter the way we think about things on an almost daily basis. If you have high blood pressure, you change your diet and exercise routines. If you can’t sleep at night, you take sleep aids and alter your schedule. When it comes to attraction, people have the mistaken belief they can’t change the way they feel, even if they continually end up in unhappy and unhealthy relationships.


If you repeatedly find yourself attracted to very smart or much less intelligent people, try to find a happy medium.
Look at other factors of attraction besides intelligence, and decide what matters to you most.
Shift your focus to finding a partner who is happy with or without you. These confident, content individuals will make better partners no matter what their IQ.

 Spaghetti squash need a long growing season and warm temperatures, and that includes warmth at planting time. So any seeds would have to go out after your frost date has passed. But starting your seedlings indoors is a common way for gardeners to start their squash plants.;
, Squash seedlings will grow fairly large in a month, so small 6-pack style seed trays won’t likely suffice. If you start them that way, you’ll have to replant them in larger containers before your outside plant date.
 They’ll need to be kept somewhere warm as well as sunny in order to properly germinate and sprout.

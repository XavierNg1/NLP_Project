 Another approach is to talk to people who might be able to provide information about your loved one's policy. A good place to start is with people your loved one worked for.


Ask employers if your loved one purchased life insurance as part of a company benefits package.Additionally, you can inquire with unions or associations that your loved one belonged to. Sometimes these entities offer life insurance., Close associates of your loved one like friends or other family members might know if she or he had insurance.They may be able to tell you where to find information about the policy.
 People often discuss their insurance policies with these individuals.


Try to speak with the attorney who drafted your loved oneâ€™s will. They may have discussed life insurance during the drafting of the will.
 Often consumers will buy more than one insurance product through the same agent. Contact any agent or agents who sold your loved one an automobile or property insurance policy and ask if they also sold a life insurance policy.These agents may have also sold your loved one a life insurance policy or referred him or her to someone who did.

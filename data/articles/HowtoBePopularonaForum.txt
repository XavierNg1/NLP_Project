 People will remember a good name like mimo, bluey, moowhoo, pudding, blueshoes, fatrat, funky, junky, epicman, epicface, boohoo, iseeyou and so forth.;
, How will people know you if you make no posts at all? Be sure that the posts you make are smart and considerate of other people though. You won't be appreciated for loading the forum with your personal wishes and attitude all the time.
 Some forums contain threads that permit games and this can be a way of stimulating interest and interaction. Play games such as ban the person above you (not really, for example: I ban you for having no signature!), vending machine and count to 100.
 People like jokes, so why not always post them? Just don't make them at anyone else's expense though as that's a bore.
 Unless you want to inflame the forum and make yourself more unpopular steer clear of topics that can cause people to become overheated, bossy, pushy and single-minded. Arguing on forums is a total bore and is something that won't ever be resolved when it's on touchy subjects. Unless, of course, the forum is about those very topics anyway!

, Whether it's downloads, graphics or anything. Post content around the forum. People will recognize you for what you've posted.

 You will need CodeBreaker to get unlimited Master Balls, so you won’t have to use your own stock of this rare Pokeball. Start your game, then open CodeBreaker. Enter this code: 82005274 0001. The code should be entered exactly as shown, with the space between 4 and 0.;
, After entering the code, go to the PokeMart and talk to the NPC. You’ll notice that the PokeMart is now selling Master Ball for P0. You can buy as many as you want.
 After purchasing Master Ball, you can remove the code and then save your game.
 The code is 842CB8A9 7F8B0149. Insert the code with a space between 9 and 7, and then enter any building of the town. On the other side of the door, you will find yourself in Navel Rock.


Remove the Navel Rock code. You'll want to do this before you proceed.
 From the docks, head north and then enter Navel Cave. Once inside, head straight until you find a ladder that leads you below.
 Go southeast to find another ladder that leads down. Follow that path and keep on heading north until you reach the end.
 Climb the stairs until you reach the highest part of the mountain.


Ho Oh will appear once you reach the edge of the mountain, at the northern part.
 Once you have captured Ho Oh, do not forget to save your progress before heading down and back to the dock.


You can leave the island by taking the SS Ship, which will send you back to Lilycove City.
If you have low-level Pokémon, it's advisable that you use Master Ball instead of fighting it.
 If you're not going to use Master Ball, you will have to fight Ho Oh. This Pokémon is a fire/flying type, which means it is weak against to water-, rock-, and electric-type Pokémon.


Ho Oh is level 70 regardless of the player's overall Pokémon level, so be prepared.

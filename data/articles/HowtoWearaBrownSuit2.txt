 One of the best features of a brown sport coat is its versatility. They don’t need to be worn with matching pants; many are intended for use in less formal outfits. They can even be worn with a pair of well-cut blue jeans.Darker denim washes tend to look better with light brown sport coats, while lighter denim matches well with either tan or dark brown options.
For the especially bold, consider pairing colorful slacks with a brown suit coat. Coral or salmon shades will go especially well.
 You don’t always have to wear a button up shirt beneath sport coats. Even a well-fit white or black t-shirt can work well. Grey can work too, especially as a thicker long sleeve.One good “dressed-down” look packs plenty of stylish punch: all black with a brown sport coat.
 Lightweight sweaters or knit shirts can look great beneath a brown sport coat. Wear them without a collared shirt beneath. Either crew necks or v-neck options are fine. A different shade of brown can look particularly good, such as a tan sweater beneath a dark brown sport coat.Shades of green will work well in layers too, particularly those that have undertones similar to those of brown, such as olive or dark green.

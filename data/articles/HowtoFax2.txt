 When sending a fax from a computer, you will have the option to use software that is installed on your computer or an online service.Some operating systems come with programs that allow you to send faxes. Windows 7, for example, has a tool called Fax and Scan, which allows you to send a fax without a fax machine.
In order to use computer software, you will need to connect your computer to a phone line. If this is not possible, try using an online service instead.
There are several online services available, including MyFax, eFax and FaxZero. Some are free, some require a subscription or membership, and some services will ask you to pay per fax.
 Each program is unique, but you should see an option called "create new fax" or something similar.
 In order to fax documents using a computer, you will need to upload them to your message. You should see a button that says "upload documents" or something similar.If you have electronic documents, you can search for them on your computer and attach them to your message.
If you have paper documents, you will need to use a scanner to digitize them. If you don't have a scanner, you can also take a picture of the documents and either email it to yourself or upload the picture directly to your computer.
 Type a brief message to your recipient into the space provided on the screen, just as you would if you were sending an email. This will serve as your cover sheet, so there is no need to attach a separate cover sheet. You will also need to enter the recipient's fax number in the TO field.You may also be asked to type in a confirmation code to prove that you are not a robot.
 Once you have attached your documents, typed your message, and entered the recipient's fax number, hit the send button, and you are done.

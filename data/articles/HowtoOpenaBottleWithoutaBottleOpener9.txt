, The movement of the bottle should be in the direction of its longest axis, and perpendicular to the wall.



If you don't have a kitchen rug handy, a thick sneaker may be used instead. Simply take off your (or a friends) shoe and place the bottle of wine in the sneaker, so the wine bottle is sitting snug inside of the sneaker. Holding the wine bottle steady inside of the shoe, drive the shoe into a wall, banging it as flat as possible. A few good blows against the wall should get you on your way. (Beware: the cork may pop out completely, spilling the wine everywhere. Keep an eye on the cork, once it is sticking out of the bottle enough to grab, stop the slamming and simply use your hand to pull out the cork.)
This doesn't work with all bottles and the wine may feel a bit bubbly after that - leave it open for a few minutes to settle before drinking, if you can wait that long.
There might be a problem with the wooden houses that are common in the USA. Works well with brick houses that are mostly used in Europe. An alternative to a wall is a door frame - it must be a solid, flat surface.

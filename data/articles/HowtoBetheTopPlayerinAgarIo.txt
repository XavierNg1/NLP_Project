 When you first appear, your top priority is to gather up all the small dots. When you are big enough to split, do so as you can gather dots faster this way. Be careful of other blobs (obviously) and don't split in more than two pieces.
 When you are a medium sized blob (150 to 600 mass) you now have to start eating other players. Once again, it is not advisable to split into four pieces. You can now begin to shoot viruses into other players, then eat up all their tiny blobs. If you are lucky, you will be able to eat their big blobs too. Viruses at this stage can be your friend or a deadly enemy., When you are a big blob (600 to 1000 mass), do the same as you do when you are a medium sized blob but don't shoot players with viruses, as you will be too big and slow to maneuver around them to get at the little blobs. Continue to split and if you want, you can split into four pieces at this stage., When you are a massive blob (1000+ mass), keep away from viruses. Other players will try to shoot them at you and if you split, big blobs will probably eat most of you up, thus replacing you on the leaderboard. It is advisable to team at this point, as it is hard to stay on the top for a while without teaming., When you are quitting, you can just quit or you can be nice and give all of your mass to a very lucky tiny blob.

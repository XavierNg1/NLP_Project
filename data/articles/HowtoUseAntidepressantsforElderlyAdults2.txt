 When you start taking antidepressants, you need to make sure that you are started on the right dose. Elderly patients should be started out on half the dose that is generally prescribed for younger adults. This will ensure that too much of the medication does not remain in your body.


This common effect is typically caused by the fact that elderly patients have a slower metabolism than younger adults., The lower dose you start taking is less than what you should normally take. You have to slowly increase your dosage before you reach the dose that will treat your depression. A week or two after you start the medication, your dose will be slightly increased.


This will continue every one to two weeks until you reach the recommended dose.
You may need a dose higher than normal to reach the dose that will be helpful for your depression., Once you have picked your antidepressant and the right dosage for your medication, you should see your doctor regularly. This will help you keep track of any side effects, monitor any new conditions that may arise, and keep a check on your depression. When you visit your doctor, make sure he or she looks for:


Worsening depression.
Emergence of an anxiety disorder or agitation.
A possibility of a suicide risk during early treatment.

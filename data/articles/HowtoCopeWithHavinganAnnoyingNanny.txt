 When the nanny tells you to do something you don't want to do, like chores, just stop and take a deep breath and count back from 10 then count up to 10. This will control your annoyance and anger.;
, Just listen to your nanny to keep him/her happy. She usually doesn't stay for long anyway, and if you do everything that your nanny tells you to do, your parents might be impressed and get you something that you really wanted (a new game, to go to a slumber party, etc.).
 Talking with them can get you to understand him/her as well as get the nanny to know you.
 After doing what the nanny tells you to do, try playing games or doing something interactive with each other such as baking cookies, playing outside, or even just talking.
 She takes care of you. If she didn't want to take care of you, she would've told her boss and get sent to take care of another child.
 Tell her everything about her that bugs you. They may switch nannies for you.

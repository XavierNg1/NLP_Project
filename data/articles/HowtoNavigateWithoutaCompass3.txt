 You need to have a watch with hour hands, not a digital face to use it. You also need to know your watch is working and set to the correct time.


Note: You should only use this method between 40 and 60 degrees north or south of the equator. The closer you are in proximity to the equator, the less accurate this method will be.If you have a digital watch, you can simply draw a circle on the ground with a stick. You can use this to represent the watch., Turn your body while holding the watch until hour hand is pointing in the direction of the sun.


If you are in the southern hemisphere, point the twelve on your watch in the direction of the sun.
If you are drawing the "watch" on the ground, draw a line in the direction of the sun. This will represent the hour hand, or it will represent the twelve in the southern hemisphere. Draw another line to indicate approximately where the other hand on the watch would be according to the current time. In the northern hemisphere, you would draw a line to the 12. In the southern hemisphere, you would draw the second line toward the current hour.
 Find the midway point between the hour hand and the number twelve on your watch.If you are in the northern hemisphere this line points south. If you are in the southern hemisphere, this line points north.

If you’re the petitioner in the case, you should have file-stamped copies of the documents you filed with the court to open the case: the petition, summons, and possibly other documents, too. On the top right of each document’s cover page, a file stamp and a case number will be stamped.
If you aren’t the petitioner and don’t have access to the file-stamped documents in the case (or if you’re the petitioner but lost your file-stamped documents), see the next step.;

Under Superior Court, click the county in which the case is filed.
Unfortunately, each county’s superior court website has a different way of accessing case information. However, you should be able to search for a case number using the Petitioner’s name or Respondent’s name.

 The main thing you'll need is the zinc-carbon lantern battery. You may also need pliers, wire cutters, screwdrivers, utility knives, and other similar implements to assist you in dismantling the battery. It is recommended that you wear gloves for the whole procedure.
 You will notice a rim at the top of the battery; using a knife or a screwdriver, cut/pry off the top.
 Inside the opened battery, you'll find four smaller batteries, all connected by wires. Cut off the wires, and you'll have the four batteries to work with.
 For each of the four batteries, pull the protruding end with a pair of pliers. You should be able to pull out the carbon rod. Then, dig out the remaining contents in the battery; the black powder you'll find is a mixture of manganese dioxide and carbon. This, along with the carbon rod, can be disposed, or stored for potential experimenting. (These chemicals are not hazardous, so you do not need to worry too much about handling/disposing them.)

, Avoid washing it, especially at a sink, as the manganese dioxide-carbon residue is not water-soluble. Instead, try wiping it clean, cutting open the battery if you need to. Once that's done, you'll have your zinc metal!

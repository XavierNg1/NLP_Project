 To stay mentally and physically quick, you must take care of yourself. Exercise at least three times a week, more if possible. Exercise increases blood flow to your entire body, including your brain. , Eat healthy, balanced, and consistent meals. Eating right gives your body the fuel needed to perform at its best. Eggs and spinach, for example, are super foods for the brain. They both contain the amino acid tyrosine, which has been shown to increase reaction speeds.Conversely, drinking alcohol or using illegal substances can slow your reaction speeds down.
 If you are tired, you will probably respond to any external stimuli in a sluggish way. Make sure to get at least eight hours of good, solid, undisturbed sleep a night. This will allow you to stay alert for longer periods., It is very tempting to down a cup of coffee whenever you need speed and focus on a task. However, this can backfire. Caffeine can help to boost your response times, but it must be used in a controlled way. Stick to one cup prior to working on a task requiring quick responses. Otherwise, you might get jittery and less focused., Some medications can slow down your response time and reflexes. Or, you may even experience dizziness or blurred vision. If you need a high reaction speed, make sure to talk to your pharmacist or your doctor about how your medications might impact your abilities.This is an especially important step to follow if you are about to drive a motor vehicle. Even in good conditions, youâ€™ll want to have sharp reflexes.

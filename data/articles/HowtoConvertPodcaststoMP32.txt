 dbPowerAmp is a popular, ad-free program for both Windows and Mac OS used for CD ripping and audio conversion.


If you do not have it, you can purchase and download it from https://www.dbpoweramp.com/. There is also a 21-day free trial period if you want to try it out first.
 dbPowerAmp Music Converter will immediately open to a browsing window to locate the file you wish to convert. Once a file is selected, a menu with various encoding options will appear.


You can select multiple files by holding Ctrl (Windows) or ⌘ Cmd (Mac) while selecting files.
 This is located in the upper left corner of the window.


LAME is the name of the encoder being used.
 Move the slider to the right to increase quality, and to the left to decrease. Lower quality files will sound worse but encode more quickly and take up less space.


You can also choose between bitrate settings like VBR (variable bitrate) and CBR (constant bitrate). Variable bitrates are more efficient and take up less space, while Constant bitrates maintain a higher quality throughout the track.
 Click the folder icon and select a location on your computer you would like the converted file to be saved to.


This will create a copy of your podcast with the new format in the location you choose. The source file will remain in its original location on the computer.
 A progress bar(s) will appear showing the conversion process. Once the bars are all filled a “Done” button will appear to close the window.

 Make sure to save your project before exporting. You would not want to lose all of your hard work because something happened to your computer.
 Exporting your project as a 32-bit float WAV file will give you a large, high quality file that is likely to play easily in almost any common software media player. You can always use this file to make lower quality mp3s, or any other format. Remember, you may not be able to rely on having the original project file when you need a lower quality file (for example, for publishing online).
 The native file format Audacity uses to record your audio to your hard disk is .AU (Sun/NeXT), it stores your audio in separate approximately 1 Megabyte chunks for less time-consuming partial track editing. However, the .AU format Audacity uses for these 1 Megabyte files appears to be altered in some way as to be only playable by Audacity. If you have not saved a project file, those files still exist on your hard disk, but they are stored in your Audacity temporary files folder. What this may mean for obsessive quality purists is that since the original recording is stored in AU format, the purest, most unaltered way of Exporting your original recording to a single file may be the .AU (Sun/NeXT) format. 32-bit float of course is the highest bit depth available at this time. And just for your information, with a good, well tuned sound system, a very well trained and sensitive ear can easily hear the difference between a complex, low distortion, high quality recording saved in 24 bit and 32 bit float, at 48,000Hz. The disadvantage of using the .AU (Sun/NeXT) format is that if you use Windows, Windows Media Player does not support playback of that format. There are however a number of free media players available which do play the .AU format.

 Enunciation is very important for communication. When speaking, pace yourself. Pronounce every syllable. Do not slur or mumble your speech. Speaking too quickly will muddle your words, and it may cause the other person to misunderstand you.Use an appropriate volume. You do not want to yell while you speak, nor should you be so soft-spoken that the other person cannot hear you. As you speak, try to match the volume of the other person.
 Carefully consider the impact of your words before you say them. Understand whether or not someone might misunderstand you, or if they might take offense. Word your statements carefully so that your meaning is not mistaken.


Avoid talking about politics and religion. These touchy subjects can cause disagreements between family and friends., Try to stop saying "Um," and "Like," or other filler words and avoid using slang. Expand your vocabulary (try flashcards or a word of the day email) so that you can better express yourself.
 If someone else is speaking, wait until they are finished with their idea before you respond. Do not interrupt or speak over others. There are certain things you can do to let the other person know that you are engaged in the conversation:


Nod your head as they speak.
Make eye contact.
Occasionally repeat back what they said., Cursing can be offensive and rude. While you may feel the need to replace curse words with more polite phrases, it is better to keep your anger to yourself if you are upset or startled.


If you are having trouble with swearing, try keeping a swear jar where you put a dollar every time you curse. You should either donate this money or save it for an essential purchase.

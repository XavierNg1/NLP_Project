 If you've got a well-tuned and maintained piano or keyboard handy and are familiar with the notes, one easy way to quickly tune your guitar is to play each note and match the pitch of the corresponding string.
 Lots of tone-generating devices and e-tuners are available that you can use quickly and in a pinch to get your guitar in tune. One of the most effective tuners available is the basic tuner available in the Apple app store. It's super cheap and super accurate. As long as your phone has juice in it, you can tune your guitar.
 You might not be able to get a guitar in perfect pitch, but you can at least make sure the guitar is tuned to itself appropriately by matching the intervals of all the strings. When you fret the low E string at the fifth fret, that's an A. So, to tune the guitar, you can play an A on the E string and tune your A string. This is a good way of checking the relationships between all the strings after you've consulted an electronic tuner, or just getting the guitar in tune with itself so you can play alone or practice.









This is true of the relationships between all the strings but G and B. For that interval, fret the G string at the fourth fret, which should be a B.
 You don't always have to tune your strings the same old way. Famous guitar players like Jimmy Page, Keith Richards, and John Fahey frequently used alternate tunings to play their best-known songs, and alternate tunings are great for playing Delta blues or slide guitar styles. Some guitar players like to tune the bottom string to D, rather than E, making it easier to play certain chords and some styles of music.This is called Drop-D tuning. Other common alternate tunings include:









Irish tuning (DADGAD)
Open C tuning (CGCGCE)
Open D tuning (DADF#AD
Open G tuning (DGDGBD)

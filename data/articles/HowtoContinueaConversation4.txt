 If the conversation starts to lag, ask questions. Don't just ask the person to reiterate something she's already said, ask sincere questions that you don't know the answer to. It may get the person talking about something that could end up being very interesting and engaging., If you and the person you're talking to have things in common or similar tastes/interests, you can fall back on those topics when the conversation stalls. For example, if the person said earlier in the conversation that she really likes comedic movies, and you find yourselves with an awkward pause, say something like, "So you were saying you like comedies. Have you seen any good movies lately?", Sometimes you may need to step away from a conversation for a moment. If there's a long pause and you can't think of anything to contribute, perhaps excusing yourself for a moment might help jumpstart the conversation when you get back. Excuse yourself politely by saying something like, "Will you excuse me a moment? I need to use the restroom" or "I'm really enjoying this conversation. I just need a drink of water - will you excuse me a moment?"Then use your momentary absence to think of something to talk about when you get back. You may even find something to talk about if you observe something interesting while you're gone - just be sure you don't come back with gossip., Sometimes you can restart a stalled conversation, but eventually the conversation must draw to a close. If it's a strenuous conversation to keep going, that may be all the more reason to find a smooth conclusion to the conversation. If things simply can't be restarted, or if you believe you've already exhausted the conversation, end it politely and respectfully by saying something like, "Well it was really good talking to you. I learned a lot about _____! Thank you for listening, and I hope we can continue this conversation another time."

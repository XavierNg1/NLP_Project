 Too little saliva makes your mouth vulnerable to tooth decay.Take the following steps to prevent more serious and painful oral problems:



Floss and brush your teeth with recommended techniques, twice a day.
Consider a daily rinse and spit with fluoride mouthwash. Avoid mouthwashes that contain alcohol, which can dry out the mouth., Without saliva, the soft tissues of your mouth are at risk for pain and damage. Keep them moist and healthy:


If brushing your teeth hurts, use a soft-bristled brush and replace toothpaste with 1 tsp (5 mL) salt stirred in 4 cups (1 L) water.Look for over-the-counter mouthwashes and moisturizing gels designed to treat dry mouth, such as glycerin. Ask your doctor or dentist for recommendations.
 Use moisturizing lip balm, preferably from a pot and not a waxy tube. Avoid balms that contain eucalyptus, menthol, camphor, phenol, or alcohol, as these may cause drying in the long run irritating the mucosa., A checkup every six months is recommended to keep your teeth clean and catch problems early. A dentist can also give you more advice on how to deal with your condition. Before any dental work begins, ask your dentist to make your experience more comfortable:Ask to have control over the suction device, so you only use it when you need it.
Ask your dentist to spray a little water on your tongue during each rinse.
Arrange a hand signal in advance, so you can let your dentist know when you need a hydration break.
 Damaged salivary glands can cause pain if mucus or small calculi (tiny rocks) blocks the area around them. Try massaging the area just below your earlobes, then over the top jawbone area. A warm pack may help as well.This could be a sign of a serious condition, such as Sj√∂gren's Syndrome. Visit a doctor.

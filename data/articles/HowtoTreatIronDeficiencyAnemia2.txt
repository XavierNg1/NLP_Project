, Certain foods can decrease your body’s iron absorption. If you have iron deficiency anemia, do not drink tea, coffee, or cocoa with your meals because they lower the amount of iron you absorb. You should also not take an iron supplement with your meals.


Don’t drink milk or eat other dairy products for at least an hour after taking iron. The calcium in dairy products may decrease iron absorption.

 Be honest and tell the grieving person you don't know what to say or do. Then ask what you can do to help.For example, "I heard about your grandfather passing. I'm so sorry for you and your family, and I wish I knew how to help. What can I do for you?"

, The days immediately following a loss tend to be particularly hectic. If the bereaved does not ask you to help with specific activities, offer to pick up groceries, help with housework or cooking, or care for pets or children.It is more helpful to make specific offers than it is to say "Tell me if you need anything."

, Don't worry about saying the right things. Simply being there is a show of support.If you are unable to attend an event, send a tangible expression of your love and support. You might consider sending a sympathy card, flowers, or a CD of uplifting music. If the person is spiritual, you could send the person something that affirms her traditions about loss and death.
Be sensitive. How cultures and spiritual traditions deal with grief, death, and loss varies widely.Do not assume that others will experience it the same way that you do, or find comfort in your own traditions.
 Simply ask if she feels like talking and then sit silently and listen. Allow the grief to take form in tears, as well as happy memories.Don't be afraid to express your own emotion and affection. Sitting closely and hugging are great ways to physically support the bereaved. Crying is an appropriate way to express your empathy for the bereaved. Smiling or laughing when funny or happy memories are shared are ways to honor the life of the dead.

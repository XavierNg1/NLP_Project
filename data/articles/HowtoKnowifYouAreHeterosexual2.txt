 Sometimes it can help to talk things over with someone who may be going through the same things and asking the same questions as you. Tell a friend you trust about the questions you have, and ask them about their own experiences, if they feel comfortable talking about it.


If you know your friend is comfortable talking about their sexuality, try asking something like, “When did you first figure out that you are straight/gay/bisexual? How did you know?”

, Look for a moderated forum where you can talk (anonymously, if you prefer) with other people who are also looking for answers about their sexuality. If you’d rather not join the discussion, just reading other people’s conversations about the topic can be helpful. Try starting with the Sexual and Gender Issues forum at PsychCentral: https://forums.psychcentral.com/sexual-gender-issues/

, If your questions about your sexual identity are causing you a lot of anxiety and stress, consider making an appointment with a mental health specialist (psychologist, clinical social worker, or counselor). They may be able to help you understand your sexuality better, or point you in the direction of some helpful resources.

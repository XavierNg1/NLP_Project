 If you are simply painting a tile as a stand-alone art piece, the simpler the tile the better. You can also, however, paint any ceramic tile that already exists in your house, though textured tiles require a bit more precision.


Both glazed and unglazed tiles will work fine for this process.;
, It is extremely important that you use the correct type of paint in order for it to adhere to the ceramic tile and not be affected by exposure to elements such as water.
 If you are painting an intricate scene or design on your tile, you'll most likely need several different sizes of brushes. If you are painting a large bathroom wall, for example, you can use a larger brush.
 Make sure to lay down newspaper or a drop cloth over any surface that you do not want to get paint on.


Keep damp rags nearby in case you need to fix any mistakes and have water ready to clean your paintbrushes if necessary.

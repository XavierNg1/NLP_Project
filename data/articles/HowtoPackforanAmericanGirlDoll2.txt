 The list will help you choose what to take. But it's also useful to take with you, as you can check it off each time you leave a place you're staying at, to make sure you have all the things you brought along.
 This could include:


2 pairs of casual clothing
2 pairs of pajamas
Don't waste space packing extra things you don't need for a short trip.
 This could include:


Several sets of casual clothing
2 or more pairs of pajamas
Bathing suit (even if it's cold, pools are often inside hotels)
Snow gear like skates (depending on time of year).
 Pack your doll's hairbrush, hair pick (for curly haired dolls), anything you absolutely need.


Maybe include a hair helper kit, if you have one.
 Again, remember how easy it is to lose things while traveling.
 Your doll loves her stuffed animal, so always remember them.

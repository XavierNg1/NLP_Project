 Botulism is very serious and can be fatal. If you notice any of the symptoms it is extremely important that you seek medical attention immediately. You doctor will likely ask you about foods you have eaten recently and if you could have been exposed to bacteria through a wound.Make sure that you know what foods you have eaten. Pay special attention to any home-canned foods, which can contain bacteria that causes botulism.
Tell your doctor if you use needles regularly. This can often result in wound-based botulism.
Botulism antitoxin is the first line therapy for the condition. Sometimes antibiotics are also used. Antibiotics are recommended for wound botulism after antitoxin, but antibiotics are not recommended for infant botulism or for adults with GI symptoms.
 Many of the symptoms associated with botulism are also common in other illnesses, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, bacterial/chemical food poisoning, tick paralysis, cerebrovascular accident, and myasthenia gravis. As a result your doctor may need to learn your family medical history and conduct tests to rule out any other potential medical issues., In order to diagnose foodborne botulism doctors will need to monitor your symptoms as well as test your blood, stool, or vomit for traces of the toxin. Results from the test can take a few days to receive so it is very important that you fully explain all of your symptoms to your doctor. Your doctorâ€™s clinical examination is the primary way to diagnose botulism.

 The seal of the bottle cap should be located at the very bottom of the plastic cap. The seal is a perforated line.
 Scissors will probably be the easiest and safest, but you could also use a steak knife.Be careful when handling sharp blades.
 Start a sawing motion, back and forth, with the blade along the seal. Continue until you've broke the seal.
 After a portion of the seal has been broken, it should be easier to use your hands. Twist the cap firmly in a counter clockwise direction.
 If you were unable to twist the seal off using your hands, continue sawing the seal with a blade. Finish by sawing the entirety of the seal before using your hands again., Once the seal is fully cut, you should be able to open the bottle with ease.

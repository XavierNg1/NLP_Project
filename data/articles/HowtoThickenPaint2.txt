 You will need cornstarch, water, a pot, tempera paint, and a sealable container to make your paint thicker. Have these materials ready when you begin this project., Add 4 teaspoons of cornstarch to 3 cups of water in a pot. Mix them together until theyâ€™re combined. Heat the mixture on low heat stirring frequently. Stir until the cornstarch has dissolved and the mixture becomes smooth and thick., When the mixture is smooth and thick, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool. Stir the mixture after it has completely cooled., Slowly add the cornstarch mixture to the tempera paint stirring occasionally. Use a spoon to add the cornstarch mixture or slowly pour it into the paint. Add the cornstarch mixture until the paint reaches the thickness you desire., Use a sealable container to store any extra cornstarch mixture. You can use the cornstarch thickening agent to make tempera paint thicker in the future.

 If you and the seller are interested in exchanging properties you may be able to negotiate a deal with no down payment. It can be rare to find a straight swap for property and you may have to include some cash if the value of the property you are leaving is below that of the property you are buying.A property exchange can be a way to defer certain taxes related to gains from the sale of property., You may be able to agree a deal with the seller to use non-cash assets instead of making a down payment. This will depend entirely on the seller, but there are instances when such a deal could be agreed. You might agree to pass over your car, or some furniture, to cover the equivalent of a down payment.For some people, a cash payment may not be the most valuable offer.
If the value of the thing you are exchanging is high, it might work out as a better deal for the seller than putting the cash payment in a bank account with low interest rates.
 A common way to purchase a property with no money down property is to use private financing. You may be able to borrow the money from a friend or family member, or you may be able to get a separate loan from a financial institution. If you can get a loan to cover the down payment, you can buy a property with no money down, but with more debt to pay off.This can be a good option if you have a secure future income to pay off the debts.
Often the interest rates and repayment terms on loan will end up more expensive than saving up and making a down payment.
Donâ€™t be tempted into a high interest loan to cover a down payment as you are likely to put yourself in a precarious financial position.

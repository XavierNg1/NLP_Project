 MiniÂ marshmallows work best as they melt faster, but any kind is good.;
, Keep cooking in the microwave for 10 seconds and mixing until the marshmallows form a smooth, pasty goo.
 Any kind of cereal will work well.
 When mixed, transfer the whole mixture to a rectangular dish.
 While optional, this can increase the tastiness of the bars. Possible toppings include: melted chocolate, melted caramel, maple syrup, cinnamon, and nuts.
 Chill for about 2 hours. Alternatively, if the dish is freezer-proof, place the bar mixture into the freezer for 1 hour.
 It will firm up and stick together when it has chilled for long enough.
 Cut the mixture into bars of any size you'd like. They can be eaten straight away or wrapped in wax/parchment paper or foil for eating later. Be sure to wrap them individually if they are being used for a camping or outdoor trip, allowing each person to take their own with them.

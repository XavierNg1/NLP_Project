 The handheld and saucy nature of ribs means that they’re an inherently casual food. They’re a staple of laid-back gatherings like cookouts. Respect their relaxed qualities (and the relaxed qualities of the party or venue you’re attending) by wearing comfortable and easy-to-wash clothes. T-shirts, cotton shirts, and denim are all appropriate choices.It’s probably smartest to avoid white or pastel colors.
If you’re a lipstick-wearing person, consider switching to lip balm for the evening (unless you’re going for the Joker look).;
, Ribs are delicious because they’re a fall-apart tender, barbecue-sauce-soaked food that you eat with your hands. These wonderful qualities also make them a rather messy treat. Get ready by making sure you have your preferred clean-up supplies at hand, which could include paper towels, paper napkins, or moist towelettes.


Some people wear bibs at restaurants or cookouts. This is okay if everyone else is doing it, but it might be eccentric to be the lone adult bib-wearer.A detergent pen (like a Tide To Go pen) is a useful thing to bring as well.
Bring extra moist towelettes for your friends--you’ll be popular and polite.
 A finger bowl is a retro, but useful conceit: it’s a small bowl filled with water that you can rinse your saucy fingers in. If you’re eating ribs in a (slightly) more formal setting, your server may set it on the table during the meal or bring it after you eat your ribs., Ribs are delicious, but you need something to wash them down, as well. Whether you drink alcohol or not, pick a beverage that you feel complements the rich nature of ribs and sauce. This way, you won’t get bogged down by the flavors when you’re eating.If you don’t drink, iced tea (sweet or not) is a classic choice to go along with barbeque.
If picking a red wine, try something with rich and fruity notes to play off the meatiness of the ribs.Malty-flavored and Oktoberfest-type beers go well with ribs, too.

 The best thing you can do for inspiration is... think of things you like. It might be a movie you love, your favourite animal, one of your typical hobbies, or anything that can possibly relate to you.;
, Listen to songs or watch music videos. Do anything to give you a good idea of maybe what you want your character's personality to be like, events you want to see happen, etc.
 If you want to write about ghosts, search them up. You don't want to go into a story with no information to back up the things you're putting down on paper.
 You don't want the story to be boring, and you want to catch the reader's attention. Start with a bold, interesting first statement, something to really catch the attention.
 You want a good flow throughout your story so that it looks and sounds good, and will make sense to readers.
 Remember, writing is fun if you make it so. Do you want this story to be interesting and hold a reader's attention? Then have fun with it! Add your own spice and flavour to it.

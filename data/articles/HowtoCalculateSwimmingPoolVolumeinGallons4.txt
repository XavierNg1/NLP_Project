 Simply find the minimum depth and the maximum depth of the pool and divide the result by 2. Let's say the shallow end of the pool measures 3 feet and the deep end measures 8 feet. (3 + 8)/2 = 5.5. The average depth of the pool is 5.5 feet.
 Now, just find the average of all the widths of the pool by adding up the different widths and dividing by the amount of widths. Let's say you're working with a pool that has three widths: 20, 15, and 20. So, add them up and divide by 3. 20 + 15 + 20 = 55. 55/3 = 18.3 feet. The average width of the pool is 18.3 feet.
 Let's say the length of the pool is 40 feet.
 So, 5.5 feet x 18.3 feet x 40 feet = 4,026 cubic feet.
 4,026 cubic feet x 7.48 = 30,114 gallons.

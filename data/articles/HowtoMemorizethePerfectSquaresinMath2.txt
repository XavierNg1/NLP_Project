 Graph paper has printed lines that appear vertically and horizontally across the page. The result is that the page looks like a grid with many boxes on the page.


Solving the perfect squares by using shapes can help you picture the problem visually and further your understanding. If you struggle with working with numbers on a page, you might find this method is more helpful to train your brain.
 Make a box that goes around several boxes on the graph paper. Just make sure the box is square in shape, with an equal number of grids on each side. Write the number of graph squares of any given side above the box you have traced. This will be the root number you are going to square.


For example, draw a box that is 3 squares long by 3 squares wide.
 Number from right to left, then top to bottom. When you have filled all the squares, you have your answer. The highest number is the square of your root number.Number all the boxes in your 3-by-3 box shape. The highest number will be 9. So, 3Â²=9.

 It is never a good idea to get uppity when your facts are inaccurate!;
, Make it clear that you are not happy hearing a radio show host asking for special deals for their own benefit during public airtime.
 Be brief and to the point, be clear about the fact that you are not happy that a radio show host is using the show to try to get special personal deals from businesses in your community. Point out how unfair it is to listeners who don't have that celebrity pull and how the radio show host comes across as pulling status to get a personal benefit that the average person could never get.
 Many places have these on TV or radio and will often find this kind of journalist self-promotion newsworthy and will follow it up.
 Spread the word that it bothers you. If you've got a following, it'll catch on.

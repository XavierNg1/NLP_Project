 If your teeth are giving you issues, you can use numbing gels on your gums. These gels, which contain benzocaine, should be applied directly to your gums to help numb your toothache. Don't swallow the gel if possible, but spit the excess out instead.


10Â % lidocaine spray is another option, but be careful not to spay it down your throat when you apply.
Make sure you follow the instructions on the tube to know how much to apply and how often.;
, When you tooth aches, you can take over-the-counter pain medication to help. These medications include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil), acetaminophen (Tylenol), and naproxen (Aleve).


Make sure to follow the instructions for dosage on the label., If you are in a lot of pain, be careful not to overuse either the gels or pain medications. Using too much gel with benzocaine can cause a rare but serious issue called methemoglobinemia, which is a deadly illness in which the oxygen levels your blood can carry are decreased.


Too many pain medications can also cause other problems, such as stomach issues and ulcers.
Never use benzocaine on anyone under two years of age.

, Start with firm, shiny chestnuts. Discard chestnuts with cracks or holes in the shell.


It's not too uncommon to see white "worms" (larvae) inside some of the chestnuts. Throw these away if you notice them while cutting or peeling.
 Rinse them to remove any dust on the chestnuts. Many people like to pat the chestnuts dry, but this may not be necessary.
 Find a very sharp paring knife if possible, or use the heel of a larger, sharper chef's knife. Cut a ½ inch (1.25cm) X into the flatter side of the chestnut. Make sure to cut through the entire shell. If you don't do this, the chestnuts can explode from trapped heat and steam.


Chestnuts have hard shells. Try starting with the tip of the knife, and watch your fingers.
 A loose wrapping can help keep the chestnuts moist, but makes them more difficult to peel. If you decide to do this, pile the chestnuts onto a large piece of aluminum foil, with the X on top. Wrap loosely, leaving a large hole at the top of the foil.
 If you aren't using foil, just spread the chestnuts out in a single layer, with the X on top.
 Place the baking sheet in the oven. Starting at about 20 minutes, begin testing the chestnuts to see if they're done. Here are a few signs:


You can easily stick a toothpick through the center of the X, and crumbs are on the toothpick when it withdraws.
The flaps left from the X-shaped incision have curled back or burst open.
Chestnut flesh is golden brown.
 Remove the chestnuts from the oven. Let them cool for 10–15 minutes, then peel before they cool completely. Salt them before eating, or fry the peeled chestnuts in butter until golden brown.

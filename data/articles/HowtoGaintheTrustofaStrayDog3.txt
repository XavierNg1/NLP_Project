 Before you try to gain a dog’s trust, take time to observe them. Watch their behavior from a safe distance. If they seem fearful, aggressive, erratic, or sickly, even from far away, it’s best not to approach them. Instead, contact your local animal control to notify them of the situation.Some tell-tale warning signs include unusual gaits or movements, excessive salivation, skittish or predatory behavior, intense tracking of you or other animals at a distance, howling, barking, snapping, or growling at distant people or animals.
 If a dog growls or bares their teeth at you at any point, do not continue to approach them or stand near to them. Avoid eye contact and immediately begin backing away at a slow pace.Other potential signals of aggression include a low bark, erect ears, a stiff tail, and the hair on their back standing up.
It’s important to remain calm as you back away. If you turn and run, an aggressive dog is likely to chase after you like prey.
 Stray dogs may carry diseases. Be especially wary of canines that exhibit symptoms of rabies, like foaming at the mouth, disorientation and restlessness, light sensitivity, and/or aggression. If you think a stray might be rabid, contact your local animal control immediately.If you are attacked by a stray dog, go to the hospital immediately for treatment and a rabies test. You should also contact the police and animal control to warn them that there’s an aggressive dog on the loose.
 When you’re trying to gain the trust of a stray dog, it’s best not to involve other animals in the situation. Strays are skittish and unpredictable, so you want to limit their social interactions and keep them as simple and controlled as possible.For example, bringing your own dog to meet the stray can put both at risk while compromising the trust you’ve built with the stray.
If you do end up trying to help the stray dog, it’s still a good idea to keep them apart from your other animals until you’re sure that they’ve been vaccinated.

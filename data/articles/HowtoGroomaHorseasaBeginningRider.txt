 In many stables, each horse has a grooming kit of its own, or in others, brushes are placed in a central location and shared. Find out how your stable stores its grooming gear, and either take the grooming kit, or get what you'll need -- at least one currycomb, dandy brush, soft brush, face brush/cloth, hoof pick, and comb.;
, These come in many different styles, but are essentially a sturdy rubber or plastic brush with little points sticking out. The purpose of the currycomb is to loosen the dirt and dust in the horse's coat. To use it, brush the horse's coat in circular motions.
 Do this by brushing in the same direction, to smooth out the horse's coat as well. Start with the dandy brush, which has stiffer bristles, and then clean up with a softer brush. You can also use the soft brush on the horse's legs, if your instructor gives you permission.
, Remove the dirt, manure, and other debris that may be stuck in there. This is done with a tool called a hoof pick, that can come in many different styles, but usually has a pointy end for removing stuff and often a brush as well. To pick up your horse's foot for picking, run your hand down his leg, squeeze the lower part slightly, lean on his shoulder, and pull up. Your instructor will help, if necessary. Then, hold the hoof comfortably and begin cleaning it.
Hoof picking is one of the only parts of grooming that really involves anything besides common sense. When You pick up the horse's foot, you'll see that's oval-shaped, with a "V" in the middle. The "V" is called the frog, and it is very sensitive. Do not touch it with the hoof pick, but clean in the crevice around it. Carefully dislodge any stones, if you find them, and get all the dirt out.
 Use conditioner, if you're having trouble and your instructor suggests it.
 You must always do this from the side, so that you'll be less of a target if he kicks.

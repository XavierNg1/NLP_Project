 Before anything else you need to dress like a Hunter. Luckily that is not too difficult. You need brown pants, a white or gray shirt, a blue hoodie and some duct tape.;
, This means that you should seem a little crazy or perhaps a little drunk. Also, try to be out mostly at night. If you must come out during the day, then try to stay in the shade whenever possible.


Of course you need to draw the line somewhere. Don't do everything that a character from a first person shooter does, that will create legal trouble for you.
 If you aren't crawling, then hunch over and put your hands out in front of you. Try to hold your fingers as if they were mangled in an accident.
 The hunters are always climbing around on objects. You should climb around as best you can to complete the image.
 Pouncing is not that hard. when you pounce you have to squat like a frog. Using your hands to stabilize your weight. It takes about a half second for the blood to pump into your legs allowing you to jump at lightning speed toward your target.


When you attack your target your victim is on his back. one leg is on one side the other is on the other side of your victim. The important thing to know about a hunters victim is once their on there back their a lot like a turtle they can't get up... In fact a victim can't even push a hunter off once their in this position no matter how hard they try they will never get the hunter off of the victim. Now generally when a hunter is in this position he will be clawing at he's victims abdomen in the hunters blood frenzy. Now that pretty much covers pouncing, face clawing.

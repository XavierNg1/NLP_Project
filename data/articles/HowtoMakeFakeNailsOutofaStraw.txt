 Any straw will do, most likely you will need at most two. It would be best to make them the same size, but it's not needed.;
, Compare the straw to your nail and cut it how you want it to be. This all depends on personal preferences.
 Now your straw should have a cut in the middle of it. Make sure not to cut it in half so that it is in two pieces.
 Put it under a heavy thing for some time, but not too long so that it gets too flat, just enough so it doesn't look like a straw anymore. You can also choose not to flatten it, but it is harder to work with and curls at the end when you put it on your nail.
 Trim around the sides so that it fits on your nail and doesn't dig into your skin. For the bottom of the fake nail, cut the edges so that it doesn't damage your cuticles.
 This is the fun part. Decorate your nails with whatever design you want. You may also choose not to decorate it if you already like the design that your straw has. Make sure to decorate it using a marker that will dry and not rub easily off.
 Make sure not to cover the whole back of the nail, just some and leaving the top empty. Make sure to put the tape on the bottom of the nail, as not to ruin the design.
 These are temporary, and you can choose to use nail glue. Make one for every nail!

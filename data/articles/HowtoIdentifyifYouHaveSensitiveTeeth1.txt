 Pick something mild to start. Eventually the colder temperatures may find a way through your tooth's enamel down to the dentin, cause some pain, and magnify the teeth sensitivity.


Try some ice cream as a starting point to see if the temperature affects you.
Chomp a popsicle, something dense enough for a hard bite, for a great next step.
Consider something harder, like ice chips, a texture that will definitely be cold long enough to test for issues.;
, Hot foods cause tooth pain because they heat the gasses produced by bacteria in the teeth. When heated, gasses expand and create pressure, causing internal tooth pain.
 The sugars in the drinks contact the dentin and the result is a fluid loss in the tooth, a consequential pressure change, and then a sharp pain. The same painful osmosis process can be caused by juicy, acidic fruits. You could also try chocolate, which can melt between your teeth and stimulate nerves inside your dentin.
 If you wince when breathing in sharply, your problem could be sensitive teeth. The air, particularly through pursed lips, is colder and might be shooting through the microscopic tubes in the dentin in your teeth.
 Gently. When teeth hit sharply against one another, it's possible to feel anything from a mild twinge to agony all the way into the nerve endings because of either direct contact with exposed dentin or forceful vibrations.You do not want to crack or chip your teeth, but when teeth normally collide in the mouth there could be some pain if dentin is exposed.


A similar type of pain may appear when a wisdom tooth starts growing and generates force throughout the bone, all the way up to the front teeth.

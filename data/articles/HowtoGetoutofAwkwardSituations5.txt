 If you forget someone’s name but you need to introduce the person to your friend, you can be completely honest and claim you have a brain fog. Apologize for forgetting the person’s name and then say your brain is so foggy from dealing with all the appointments you have that day.Most people understand that a busy schedule and stress can make your brain foggy, so using this as the reason you’ve forgotten someone’s name is a legitimate reason.
 If you’ve forgotten someone’s name, a good way to get the person to say it is to introduce a friend of yours. Find a friend nearby and say, “Hey, I’d like to introduce you to my friend.” Say your friend’s name first and then wait to have the other person finish the introduction.For example say, “I’d like to introduce you to my friend Katie Gellar”, and the person should respond by saying something like, “Hi Katie, My name is Melanie Smith”.
 You can find out the name of a person by getting the person’s contact information. You can ask the person to put the information in your cell phone, and then glance at the new contact listing before putting your phone away. Another way to find out the person’s name is to ask for the person’s business card. Many people carry business cards with them which include their name and contact information. Tell the person you want to keep in touch and ask for a business card.Ask the person to spell their name to make sure you get it right.

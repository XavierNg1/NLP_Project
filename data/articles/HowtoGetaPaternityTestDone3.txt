 Going to court to establish paternity should only be used as a last resort. This method is often utilized when a suspected father is avoiding his legal obligations to a child and the mother wants to establish paternity so the father will be required to fulfill those legal obligations. However, a man can also bring a paternity suit, which often involves the mother not allowing a suspected father visitation and/or custody rights.
 If you have decided that getting a court order is the best option for you, you must begin the process by accessing and filling out the required court documents.While this article will use California as an example, most states will generally follow the same procedures. See this article for an example of how Texas proceeds with these court orders. In California, you will be required to fill out a Petition to Establish Parental Relationship; a Summons; and a Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act.


The Petition to Establish Parental Relationship asks for information including your name, the child's information, and information about what you are asking the court for (e.g., parent-child relationship, child custody, reasonable expenses of pregnancy, and/or costs of litigation).The Summons is an informational form telling the other parent about the proceedings that have been brought.It states that the other party is being sued and it asks that other party to read the form.The Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act form asks you to indicate the children involved in the suit you are bringing and asks you to provide their personal information to the court.The form also asks if you have ever been involved in another similar suit with these children before, whether you have ever been the subject of a restraining order or protective order, and whether there are any other parties with custody or visitation rights the the child or children in question., Once you have filled out the required forms, you will file them with the clerk of courts at your county's courthouse.You will be required to pay a filing fee, although if you cannot afford the fee you may be able to file for a fee waiver here., Once you have filed your forms, you will have to serve the papers you filed, as well as a blank Response to Petition to Establish Parental Relationship and a blank Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act.You can choose to serve the other parent personally, which involves someone giving the papers to the other parent personally, or you can serve the other parent through the mail, which involves sending the papers to the other parent., Whoever you have serve the other parent will fill out and return a Proof of Service of Summons, which you will then file with the clerk of courts where you filed your original forms., After the other parent is served, they will have 30 days to respond to your suit.The other parent may either respond and agree with your suit or they may respond and challenge your suit., If the other parent responds to your suit and agrees with you that you are the father (or that they are the father), the suit will be uncontested.If, on the other hand, the other parent responds and disputes that you are the father (or that they are the father), the suit will be considered contested.If the suit is uncontested, you and the other parent will fill out a number of forms found here and you will file them with the clerk of courts.These various forms simply ask you to verify that you understand the consequences of what you are agreeing to and asks you to agree that you are the parent of the child.If the suit is contested, it is most likely because the alleged father will want a paternity test conducted in order to verify that they (or you) are indeed the father of the child.In this situation, a judge may ask the alleged father to submit a DNA sample, which can be taken by an oral swab or a blood test, and that DNA sample will then be compared to the DNA of the child.

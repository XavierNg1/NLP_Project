 What facilities are there? What needs to be changed? Will there need to be renovations made or is it just a matter of sweeping the corridor and picking the manure forks up? How long will it take? Will it cost money, and how much? If big things need to be done, such as replacing a door of a stall or fencing a meadow, ask the proprietors permission first. You don't want to get in trouble, but they may praise you for pointing out a danger., These are especially good in livery stables, because it's almost certain that people would buy a raffle ticket to help raise money for new equipment in their yard! However, if you are a private stable, get creative. Lemonade stands, car boots sales and anything else could help you save up some extra cash. If you plan on doing things like busking, get the local counsels permission first, as you may need a licence., Gather a team if needed, many people would be happy to help, and having people that are handy is even better!

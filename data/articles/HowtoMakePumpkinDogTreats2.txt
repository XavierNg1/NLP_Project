 It’s well know that pups particularly favor peanut butter. For a batch of treats your dog will love, gather two and a half cups of whole wheat flour, two eggs, half a cup of canned pumpkin, two tablespoons of peanut butter, and half a teaspoon each of salt and ground cinnamon. Don’t forget to preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).Whisk all the ingredients together, adding water until the dough is workable.
Roll out a sheet as thick as a dime is wide, and cut into small pieces.
Bake until hardened and allow to cool.
 If you want to forego baking, try another peanut butter and pumpkin dog treat recipe that can simply be prepared and served. You’ll need half a cup of peanut butter, a cup or 100% pumpkin puree, a teaspoon of cinnamon, three tablespoons of honey peanut butter, and two and a half cups of oats.Mix all the ingredients except the oats in a bowl. Spread the oats on a plate.
Roll the batter into balls, then roll the balls in the oats.
Store the balls in an airtight container in your fridge. They’ll last for three weeks, or three months in the freezer.
 To make about 40 treats and put an overripe banana to use, gather half a can of pumpkin puree, a tablespoon of honey, one and a half cups of whole wheat flour, and half a teaspoon of baking powder. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).Mix the banana, pumpkin, and honey. Work the flour and baking soda in bit by bit.
The dough should be relatively dry, but add some water if it’s too crumbly.
Roll the dough and cut it into shapes, as desired.
Bake on a parchment papered baking sheet for about ten minutes, or until golden brown.

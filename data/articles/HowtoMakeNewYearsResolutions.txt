 Why is it important to you to take better care of yourself? Perhaps you want to set a good example for your children or grandchildren. Maybe you’re concerned about aging or hereditary diseases, and you’re taking preventative measures. Or maybe you’re just at a point in your life where your health has become more important than instant gratification. Whatever the reason, getting to the root cause of the “why” will help you stick to your resolution when you’d rather quit., This specificity should take two roles: one, of a specific final result that you’ll work towards, and two, specifics about how you’ll achieve that result., Commitment is the difference between a successful accomplishment vs. another resolution that fell apart before Valentine’s Day. Be clear and firm in your commitment, and do not waver!, People who write down their goals and resolutions are more likely to achieve them than people who don’t., Taking time to measure your progress (preferably in a chart or other visual tool) can go a long way towards spurring you on to success., Whenever possible, find an accountability partner or someone with the same goal, and support each other throughout the process. People who commit to exercise with a partner (or group) are far more likely to stick with their exercise programs than people who choose to go it alone.

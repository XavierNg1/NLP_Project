 Have all of your entertainment and food/energy set out when they're ready to be used. Create a list of ideas of what to do when you are bored beforehand, because boredom is what usually makes everybody go to bed.;
,, Do not begin to do your stuff until your parents are in their bedroom, as they don't have to be sleeping. Watch TV when you're done. Midnight hours are the easiest time to stay up. Early morning is the when people begin to get to sleep. Drink energy drinks, soda, or water but not to much. Do whatever you can to stay up. Morning will be the hardest

, Smart things to gather before you go to bed should include ice packs (For waking up when you feel sleepy. Though they'll work for a while, later on you will have to make it cold again in the bathroom somehow).


If you forget to do this, play video games, watch DVDs, play on a laptop, or even a phone if you plan to stay up late and chat to a friends who's also staying up.Be sure not to be on it too long. The phone bills will rise or the electric bill (This may easy to hide, because you can say that the air conditioning turned on a lot) if you're on the phone all night, and your parents will wonder when you got the time. It can also be helpful to bring a whole packet of very minty or spicy gum, if you can. Chewing on something like that can keep your body awake longer when you start to fall asleep, but if you know you're just too tired and gum won't help you, spit out the gum, it can be dangerous to have gum in your mouth as you can choke.

 From the moment you step onto the bus to the moment you step off to get to school, just completely ignore the bully.;
, This puts you in a more hard to reach position and stops the bully from sitting by you.


It's wise to sit as near to the front as possible, so that the driver can witness what the bully is saying/doing so that they can take action. Some buses have video recorders that record what happens on the bus. If your bus has this, use it to your advantage and allow it to capture what the bully is doing to you.
 It is wise to stick with your friends as much as possible on the school bus, since they can prove valuable in helping you to cope with the bully. Also, it's nice to have a friend by your side when there's a bully calling you "dumb".
 It's hard, but if you don't respond the bully will eventually get bored and stop doing it. After all, the reason they are bullying you is to get a reaction from you!

, If the bully is saying something nasty to you, turn to your friend and ask them a question naturally, right in the middle of what the bully is saying, acting as if the bully is invisible and cannot be heard. Don't say something like "The weather is nice today, isn't it?" really loudly and obviously, or even worse, "Don't you just hate bullies?" Start a conversation as you would normally, and casually say something like "The homework yesterday was really hard, wasn't it? I think I got question 14b wrong."

, You can find many goodies in your bag to do, such as homework or a book to read. When the bully is saying or grunting something nasty, bend down and casually pick up a book and start reading, or finish your homework. This is useful because it also makes you absorbed in what you're doing and you can easily ignore the bully.
 When the bully is talking, you can pretend to fall asleep and even insert a snore or two. This makes you a pointless target as you're not listening or watching at all.

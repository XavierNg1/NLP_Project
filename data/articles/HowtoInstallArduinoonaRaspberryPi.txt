, Type in sudo apt-get install arduino. This command will ask you for your password, so do not forget to enter it., When apt asks for you to confirm the download, hit Y and then hit ↵ Enter. If the shell displays a program not found error, then you do not have apt., When the download from the APT software database is finished, plug in your Arduino and execute the IDE to start coding.

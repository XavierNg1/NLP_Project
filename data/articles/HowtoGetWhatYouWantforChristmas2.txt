 Let your friends and family know that you really want something by mentioning the item casually. Bring up the item you want several times over a period of days or weeks before Christmas.


”I saw a new bike at the store and thought it would be really fun to ride.”
”My friend got a new bike and wants me to ride with him; I wish I had one to join him”
”Did you know that bikes were on sale this week at the sporting goods store? Maybe this is a good time to get one.”

, Make sure that your parents know exactly what you want by telling them the specific thing you want. Tell them that you’d be happy if that was the only item you got this year. Chances are you will still get other presents, but let them know that this one thing means a lot to you.
 Leave a note with a nice message for your parents that includes the item you want for Christmas. Make sure that you compliment or thank your parents in the note and aren’t just demanding a new toy.


”I’m really glad I have the best parents in the world! I hope I can get an XBox for Christmas!”

, Volunteer to help out around the house to show your parents how responsible you can be. Try to pitch in with extra chores so your parents want to reward your help with a special present. The more you are able to do, the more likely your parents will be willing to get you the things you want.

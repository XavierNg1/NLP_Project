,, Rock candy takes on a beautiful hue that is accentuated by it's natural rock shape. Pick a color and flavor that complement each other. You can try one of these classic combinations or come up with your own:

Purple rock candy with lavender flavoring.
Orange rock candy with tangerine flavoring.
Pink rock candy with rose flavoring.
Red rock candy with cinnamon flavoring.
 Place them evenly around the jar and lean them against the lip of the jar. Secure them in place with small pieces of tape, so they don't slide against each other while the rock candy forms.

You can use wooden chopsticks in place of skewers.
A string suspended from a pencil is also a good base for rock candy.
Cover the jar with plastic wrap. This prevents dust and bugs from getting into the jar while the rock crystals form.
 It takes a week or two for the sugar to crystallize into the shape of pretty rocks attached to the skewers., When you're happy with the size of the rocks, remove the skewers from the jar and lay them out to dry.

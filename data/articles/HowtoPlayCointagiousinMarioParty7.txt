 You will need to collect as many coins as you can.;
, Use the "A" button to jump. Each character will receive either 0, 1, 2, or 3 coins depending on the block spin.
 Pressing the "A" button rapidly will not increase your jump amounts.
 Because this is a coin collecting minigame, every character will walk away with the amount of coins they have collected. All characters are winners in this game, except if they did not hit the coin block.

Look for basic gold and silver chains. Own a mix of both metals.
Lean heavier on the metal that suits your skin tone best, however. Individuals with fair, rosy skin often look best in silver, while those with yellow tints to their complexion usually look best in gold.
Own at least one basic pendant necklace.
Have a selection of posts, hoops, and dangling earrings if you have pierced ears.
Invest in a watch. Look for one with a metal or leather band, but avoid plastic.
Keep at least one nice tennis bracelet.
Look for classic stones like diamonds and pearls.
Keep colored jewelry subdued. Opt for small colored birthstones over chunky, funky beads.



Own a pair of high-heeled pumps. Black pumps are considered the most classic, but other neutrals may also work.
Look for a pair of low-heeled, strappy sandals for summer dress up occasions.
Consider a pair of fashion boots. Knee-high boots work well, but so do shorter boots. Look for black boots with a low to high heel.
Keep a pair of simple flats handy. Avoid wild colors and designs, and gravitate toward a neutral color with subtle detail.



Purchase a pair of simple white sneakers.
Have a pair of flat boots in your closet for winter.
Own a pair of casual flat walking sandals for summer.

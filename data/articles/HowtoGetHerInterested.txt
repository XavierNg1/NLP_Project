 You are who you are, and you will be attractive to some women, and unattractive to others, no matter what you do, who you know or how you act. That is a fact. So you must understand what to look for based on what and who you are. Geek guys, for instance, generally place a high value on intelligence in a woman, while jocks are more likely to value her breast size than her I.Q. Know what it is you are genuinely attracted to in a woman.;
, Use what you know about what you are attracted to in order to narrow this down to as few specific groups or types of women as possible. The less you have to work with, the easier it will be.
 Women "speak" through body language quite clearly, and they "hear you" this way very clearly, too. Get some books on the subject, and spend some time people watching, too. Once you understand how a woman "speaks" using body language, you have just advanced 50% of the way forward. Really, it's that important. This point alone is why men and women often have a hard time communicating. Learn to understand her body language, and you'll save yourself (and her) a lot of time and trouble before you ever make a move at all.
 Reading faces is something that very few people have heard of, never mind knowing how to do. This is a more specific type of body language, but this works for men and women equally well. Once you learn to read faces, you'll know instantly many things about a woman, without ever doing anything but glancing at her. This is invaluable recon for approaching the target female in a way that she will find acceptable. This can be done with people-watching and reading pictures of faces, too.
 Seek them out, and socialize. Use the body language reading, face reading, and astrology to understand her and how to approach her. But also, use them to break the ice and entertain her! Whether she takes them seriously or not is not of any concern; just let her think what she likes, and have fun with her. They make wonderful icebreakers and conversation topics.
 Some women might require a quiet, slow approach; others might prefer a man who walks right up and speaks his mind. Your goal is to find women to interact with, who match your natural personality. If you cannot do that with the women you are attracted to, then you must make changes in yourself to become the type of man they find attractive.

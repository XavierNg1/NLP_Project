 How many times you drain and rinse is up to your discretion, but draining and rinsing at least once is recommended.


Use a can opener to open the can, initially leaving the top in place.
Hold on to the top and flip the can over and hold it over the sink to drain the liquid.
Pull off the top of the can, being careful not to cut yourself.
Take the tuna out of the can and place it in a strainer or colander.
Rinse the tuna thoroughly with water, then press the water out using a clean hand or a paper towel.
 Place the tuna in a medium-sized bowl. Add the celery, onion, mayonnaise, and sweet relish.


Stir to combine.
Instead of yellow onion, you can substitute in the same amount of green onion.
In place of relish, you can substitute in 1/4 cup chopped dill pickles.
Be sure to thoroughly combine the ingredients so all of the elements are distributed evenly.
 Spread about half the tuna mix onto two slices of bread, then top each with your accoutrements of choice and mustard, if desired.


You can easily convert this into a tuna BLT at this point by adding 2-3 strips of cooked bacon.
 After adding the fixings of your choice, top each sandwich with another slice of bread.


At this point you also have the option of toasting the bread before spreading the tuna mix over it for a warmer, crunchier alternative.
You can also substitute a roll or a croissant in place of the sandwich bread for varying taste and texture.
You can also avoid bread altogether and use the tuna mix over a salad for a lower-carb choice.

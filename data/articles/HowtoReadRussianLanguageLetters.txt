 Every letter is read like it is written. For example, the letter "A" is always written one way. In English it is written in different ways. Also, some letters, such as "M" are written the same in both languages.;
, For example P in Russian sounds like R in English.
 You will hear the sounds of the letters, and how to read words.
, For example the word computer would be written in Russian as компьютер, but if you were to rewrite it in English letters it would look like kompyuter.
 If you have a little extra money to throw at the pursuit of learning the Russian language, go to Amazon or Google Product Search and find yourself a copy of Pimsleur Russian I - or find it some other way. Bang your way through it and work to get your pronunciation correct. Try to mimic their speech, be patient with your capabilities, and watch them grow. I personally don't go for Rosetta Stone (language learning software,) but if it works for you, great.
 You could use a Russian-English dictionary, 501 Russian Verbs, a traveller's Russian phrasebook, and a book on swearing in Russian (for that authentic touch.)You also need Teach Yourself Russian Script, because handwritten Russian looks different from the printed version and Russians rarely print by hand - not to mention some signage uses script, as well.
 Try watching movies that were made in Russia with English subtitles and Russian audio, or vice versa. Two movies I like are Nightwatch and Daywatch. Also, go to Rambler.ru and try reading some of the articles. Use Google Translateto figure out words you don't know and try to learn them. Find a Russian Word of the Day widget / gadget.

 Instead of using butter to cook your vegetables use olive oil. Depending on how much chopped vegetables you have, use ½ tablespoon to 1 tablespoon of olive oil to cook your vegetables. You can add the oil to the pan prior to adding your vegetables or stir the vegetables in the oil in a bowl or Ziploc bag.


While cooking your vegetables, you can also add in meats like chicken, fish, or beef. If adding in meat, start with a tablespoon of olive oil.
 You can also make a marinade for your meat with olive oil. This marinade works well with poultry, meat, and seafood.Place your meat in a pan and pour the marinade over it. Then, allow it to marinate for at least one hour. You can even marinate the meat overnight for a stronger flavor. Combine the following ingredients by whisking or blending:


¼ cup of fresh lemon juice
½ teaspoon of pepper
½ teaspoon of salt or to taste
3 crushed cloves of garlic
¼ cup of coarsely chopped fresh parsley
¼ cup of coarsely chopped basil, cilantro, dill, oregano, or other herbs you like.
½ cup of EVOO.
 Extend the life of your cake and baked goods by using olive oil instead of butter. The vitamin E in olive oil preserves the freshness of baked goods. Substituting olive oil in your baked goods increases the monounsaturated fats, decreases saturated fats, and decreases cholesterol in the baked goods.


If a recipe calls for a certain amount of butter, simply use ¾ cup of olive oil for every cup of butter.For savory breads and sweets such as cakes, cookies, and other desserts, use the lighter version of olive oil instead of EVOO. This lighter version has a neutral taste and can withstand high-heat cooking methods.

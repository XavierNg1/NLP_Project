 Before removing corrosion, you need to clean off any dust or grime on top of it. Use a nonabrasive cleaner, like regular dishwashing soap., To get out burnt food on the bottom of your pots without damaging them, fill the pot with a couple inches of water. Put it on heat and allow it to reach a boil and leave it there for about 10 minutes. Afterward, remove it from the heat and use a wooden spatula to pull up the food, which should have been loosened up. Repeat this until the pot is clean.Refrain from using steel wool or Brillo Pads to pick up caked on food, because they can scratch up the pot and make it harder to clean in the future.
 To remove oxidation, mix water and either vinegar or lemon juice in a pot. Turn on the heat and allow the mixture to cook for fifteen minutes after it hits a hard boil. Throw small aluminum cookware in the pot so that they can be treated as well. Repeat as necessary.


The mixture should be about two tablespoons of water or vinegar for every quart of water., Run warm water over the cookware to carefully remove any residue of the lemon juice or vinegar. Then wipe it down with a rag to dry it off.

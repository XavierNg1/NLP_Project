 Slice the apple into small sections. Make sure to cut the apple far enough from the core that you don't end up with seeds stuck in your apple slices. If you notice any seeds, remove them from the slices.You will not be using the core in your apple juice, so throw that away when you're done.
Apple skin does contain some fiber, so you don't need to peel the apple if you don't want to. Your juice will taste just as good with the skin still on.;
, Peel the skin from the oranges first. You can then use your fingers to pull the oranges apart into individual sections. Oranges are divided into sections naturally, so it's usually not necessary to use a knife when cutting oranges., How you do this precisely depends on your juicer. Usually, you will put a cup or pitcher down where the juice comes out. Then, you will feed the fruit into the machine and collect the juice as you go.The order does not matter. You can put either the apples or oranges first.
Once you've collected the apple and orange juice, use a spoon to mix the two juices together.
 If the juice is not sweet enough for you, add two teaspoons of honey. However, remember honey contains sugar. If you're watching your sugar intake, be careful about adding extra honey.If you dislike foods that are especially sweet, try adding one teaspoon of honey and then tasting the juice. If you want it slightly sweeter, add another teaspoon.

 If your house is hot and stuffy, go somewhere you'll be able to feel a nice, cool breeze. Relaxing in the shade at your local park is a great way to pass the time while escaping the misery that can come with intense summer heat. Bring a book to read, a light picnic snack, or just chat with a few friends — it's up to you!

, Nothing makes ice-cold treats taste extra delicious like hot summer sunlight. Best of all, these sorts of frozen delicacies can be enjoyed at home or while out and about.

Ice cream
Popsicles

Lemonade (or frozen lemonade)
Snow cones

 Water balloons, squirt guns, and hoses are all great ways to get cool while having a little friendly competition. If you're just hanging out with a few friends, try dividing up your "weapons" and having a free-for-all. If you're in a big group, divide into teams and wage full-scale war.

 Claiming business related deductions as a self-employed taxpayer is a trigger for an audit. These expenses are reported on Schedule C. When you file Schedule C, you become a target for an audit. By incorporating your business, you get several positive outcomes. You no longer need to file Schedule C as part of your personal tax return, and your business may be eligible for more deductions. Corporations tend to be audited less often than individuals., If you have business income, whether you are filing as a self-employed individual or for a corporation, you can limit you chance of an audit by hiring a tax professional to prepare the return. Not only will a tax professional help you maximize the deductions that you are entitled to receive, but you will also reduce your risk of an audit. The tax professional will improve accuracy on the return and reduce perceived individual bias., Self-employment requires the filing of Schedule C, which attracts audit attention. But if the amount is relatively small compared to your primary income, and if you are not claiming any related deductions, then you should be able to use Line 22 instead.

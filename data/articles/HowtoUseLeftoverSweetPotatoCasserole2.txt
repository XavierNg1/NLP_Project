 Roll small balls of cold sweet potato casserole filling in a crispy tater tot coating. Dip the balls in an egg white so that a crispy coating made with panko (or breadcrumbs), almond meal, and seasonings sticks. Bake the tots until they're crunchy and golden brown.You can serve sweet potato casserole tater tots with your favorite dipping sauce. Try a yogurt ranch dip for a creamy taste.
 Create elegant party food with just a few simple ingredients. Buy filo dough cups and just scoop a little of the sweet potato casserole filling into them. Top each cup with a few mini marshmallows and bake them until the filo crisps and the marshmallows puff up.You should serve these appetizer bites right away since the pastry will become soggy as it sits.
 Make the sweet potato casserole (marshmallows and all) into a standard biscuit dough by adding flour, leaveners, butter, and a little milk. Roll out the biscuits and bake them until they're golden brown and have risen.Consider making a cranberry butter to spread on the biscuits. Just mix leftover cranberry sauce with softened butter. Chill the butter until it firms up.
 Make sweet potato skins (or use regular potatoes) that you can fill with the leftover sweet potato casserole. You'll want to mix a little salt, pepper, and milk to the filling before stuffing the potatoes. Bake the potatoes so the edges crisp and the filling heats up completely.Serve the skins with a little sour cream, chopped pecans, or crumbled bacon.

 This method will be assuming you're making a fairly standard rectangular rug. However, it's up to you whether or not you want a fringe on the edge.









If you have some rags you'd like to use but are too short, just sew 'em together! The beauty of the rag rug is in the idiosyncrasies, not the perfections.
 This gives your rag rug volume, texture, and character. Who knew a rug could have character? Well, yours will, that's for sure.
 Do this now to see how the colors and patterns line up. You may not like how the shades frame each other and need to adjust before you make everything permanent.
 That's right; perpendicular. This makes the rug sturdy and gives it interesting visual lines.









Though you could sew away throwing caution to the wind, you may want to keep your lines evenly spaced. Every 1" - 1 1/2" (2.5-3.75 cm) is ideal.
 You may have some edges that look like they need to be shown their place; in that case, turn your rug 90 degrees and start sewing parallel lines. These can be spaced at your discretion.









You can have lines as little as 1/4" (.6 cm) apart. If you think it looks good, go for it. But if you have lines that are 6" (15 cm) apart, know that your rug risks falling apart a bit more, since it's lacking structure.

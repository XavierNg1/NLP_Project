 Line up a knife with the pod and press down to cut it open, then repeat with the remaining pods. If you don't wish to cut the pods in half, you can leave them intact or simply cut off the tips.
 Whether you chose to infuse brandy, bourbon, tequila, or another type of alcohol with vanilla, just place the beans directly into the container and close the lid. Shake well.
 Since strong-flavored spirits take longer to pick up the more subtle vanilla flavor, the bottles need to be shaken so that the vanilla gets distributed. For a week after putting the vanilla beans in the container, shake it several times a day. In the second week, shake it once a way.
 Vanilla extract made with spirits aside from vodka takes longer to infuse. Store it in a cool, dry place for at least three months.
 Open the bottle and sniff it, then take a taste. If the extract has a strong vanilla flavor, it's ready to use. If you can only taste the alcohol, replace the cap and let the extract infuse for another few weeks before using.

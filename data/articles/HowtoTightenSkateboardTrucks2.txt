 The bushings can be tightly packed or loosely packed, with the former decreasing turning and the later increasing it. When tightening your trucks, you are actually compressing the bushings, so you can get similar results by changing the bushings altogether.While not difficult, many skaters have this done at a local skate shop for the convenience.
 Not all trucks are created equally, and each company has different specs and styles. A lot of it comes down to testing different boards out and finding out what you want, but there are some things to consider for all trucks:



High or Low Kingpin: Higher pins are best for grinds, manuals, and other tricks. A lowered kingpin is best for popping ollies and kickflips.

Wider Wheels: Most wheels are standard, but heavier riders might want wider trucks, as they distribute the added weight better for smoother control., Risers are attached between your trucks and your board, providing lift for tricks. Furthermore, risers you will dampen landing vibrations, though the higher board will take some getting used.


Higher trucks can make it harder, however, to grind.

 Since political leaders have a lot of power to change the system, one of the most effective ways to reduce global warming is to pressure them to do something about it. Start by finding out who represents you at the local, state, and national level. Then, contact them and share your concern about global warming. Ask your representatives to:


Promote mass transportation projects.
Help fund alternative energy projects.
Support regulation that limits carbon emissions. For example, let your representatives know you support a tax on carbon emissions.
Enter agreements with foreign nations to limit carbon emissions, like the Kyoto Protocol., Take initiative and share your concern about global warming with the people around you. Simply by talking about it, or mentioning it, you may inform others about how it could impact their lives or the lives of their children or grandchildren.Tell people why you do certain things, like adopting a vegan or vegetarian diet.
Let people know about things they can do to reduce their carbon footprint – like insulating their home or reducing the amount they drive.
Don’t be pushy. If someone doesn’t want to talk about global warming, that’s okay. There is no reason to alienate people who don’t share your perspective.
 Look around your community for organizations and groups that share your concern. Chances are, there are many groups around you that work to educate the public and make real change to reduce global warming. Some national and international groups that take action to fight global warming include:Green Peace
Citizens Climate Lobby
The Environmental Defense Fund
Green America
The Sierra Club
Idle No More

Make sure to thaw frozen breast milk before it turns bad. When stored in a deep freezer, it can last from 6 to 12 months, but when stored in a standard freezer attached to the refrigerator, it only lasts 3 to 6 months. If kept in a freezer compartment of a refrigerator, breast milk is only good for 2 weeks.Place the container of breast milk near the front of the refrigerator as you thaw it. The front of the refrigerator is slightly warmer than the back but still safe enough to thaw the milk.;
, Give the container of breast milk about 8 hours to defrost completely.


Check that it is thoroughly defrosted by opening the container and stirring it with a spoon or coffee stirrer. If you feel any frozen chunks of breast milk, allow the container to thaw in the refrigerator for another couple of hours or finish thawing it quickly by placing it under cool to lukewarm running water.
 Thawed breast milk is best used immediately, but it is safe for your baby to drink when stored in the refrigerator for up to five days.


Move the container to the back of the refrigerator, where temperatures tend to be the coldest.
 Re-freezing the breast milk can cause lipids in the milk to degrade. The milk will be of lower quality and may even start to spoil.

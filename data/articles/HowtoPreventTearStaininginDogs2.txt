 The sight of rusty fur might unsettle you, but your dog isn't suffering from anything but the tearing. Sometimes, tearing is just a natural part of the dog's anatomy, if he has bulbous eyes, for example. Treating the tear stains is a cosmetic concern only, so it's up to you on whether or not you want to treat the problem.
 Keep some clean cotton swabs with you, and and each time you see eye goop glistening in the corner of the dog's eye, wipe it away. Don't let the fluid dry and get crusty, or it will build up in the corner of the eye. You can usually just remove this with your fingers, but sometimes it dries onto the hair and is harder to clear away. In that case, soak a cotton swab in cooled boiled water, soak the crust until it softens, and then remove it with your fingers.
 There are many grooming products that promise to remove or reduce tear staining. However, you should only use these after a vet has checked your dog to find out if you can treat the tearing yourself.


Read labels carefully to see if you need to dilute the product before applying it to your dog's face.
Some of these stain-removing products have ingredients that can irritate the eyes. Check with your vet for recommendations on how to avoid worsening the problem.

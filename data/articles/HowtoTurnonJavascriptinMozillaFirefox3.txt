 Firefox uses add-ons, extensions, and plugins interchangeably to refer to downloadable programs you can use to customize your browsing experience.
 Disabled extensions appear grayed out, and bear a label that reads (Disabled) next to them. Enabled extensions appear more colorful.
 You can also right-click an extension to bring up a menu of options.
 If your problem persists, you know that the extension you disabled is not the source. Re-enable the extension whenever you want by selecting it and clicking Enable.
 Plugins run in the background and give Firefox extra functionality, such as the ability to place Skype calls right from your browser.


Many issues stem from out-of-date plugins. You can bring your plugins up to speed all at once by clicking Check to see if your plugins are up to date at the top of the Plugins page.
, Just like with your extensions, disable one plugin at a time to test whether it's the source of Firefox's poor performance.


You don't have to restart Firefox after enabling or disabling a plugin.
 Firefox sorts your plugins alphabetically and by its status. Disabled plugins sink to the bottom.

 To begin your search, you should first visit the websites of local groups that are adopting out dogs. There are also a number of adoption websites that will help match you with the kind of dog that you are looking for.These resources will help you narrow down your search and limit it to a few dogs.You should also consider the ASPCA’s “Meet Your Match” program that will help you match with a dog that is right for you., Once you have found some prospective dogs, you should call the shelters and make plans for a visit. An in-person visit will help you get a better feel for the energy levels of different dogs. In order to determine how well you will get along, you should take the dog for a short walk and play with it.Most shelters will allow you to walk the dog and play with it. This should help you gauge the dog’s temperament and get a better feel for its personality.
If you have any other pets, be sure to bring them along. If your pets do not get along with the potential adoptee, it is not a good match.
You should also bring along any family members to help you get a feel for your family’s connection to the potential pet.
 Once you have had an opportunity to spend some time with the dogs, chat with the shelter’s staff members about their history and temperament. Because these people have been caring for the dogs, they may have important insights about their behavior and any issues that you should be aware of. You should also talk with the animal’s previous veterinarian, if it had one, to get an idea of its medical history. This is particularly important when dealing with the myriad health issues of non-sporting breeds.Ask the staff things like “How has the dog behaved since coming to the shelter?” and “What do you know about the dog’s history before coming to the shelter?”
You should ask the veterinarian things like “What medications is this dog taking?” and “What medical concerns should I be aware of?”

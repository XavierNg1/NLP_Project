 While dream interpretation is a popular form of pop psychology, there is very little research behind it. Keep this in mind when interpreting your dreams.


Freud's theories on dreams have been widely discredited and most modern psychiatrists and therapists take dreams with a grain of salt.
While your dreams may point to inner desires and feelings, keep in mind there is much we do not know about dreams. Scientists are still unsure what purpose dreams serve.
Despite this, most psychiatrists and doctors agree dreams do hold some meaning. It might not be a bad idea to consider the meaning of strange and recurring dreams. However, be skeptical of any interpretations as the dream code has yet to be cracked., Dream dictionaries offer theories on universal meanings in dream symbolism. However, your personal connection to a color or symbol is vastly more important than externally prescribed meanings. Not to mention many dream dictionaries are based on shoddy research. You're better off considering your own thoughts and feelings than consulting a dream dictionary., If you have a recurring dream that's preventing you from getting quality sleep, talk to a therapist. Recurring disturbing dreams can be a symptom of many psychiatric disorders.

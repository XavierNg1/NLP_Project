 This will show your Snapcode and your profile., This will display users who have recently added you to their own friends list. You'll be notified both for people that you already added to your own friends list, and people that you haven't added before.

These notifications disappear after leaving this screen, so if you don't add someone back now, you'll need to look them up later.
 This will add them to your own friends list.

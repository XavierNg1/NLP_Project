 You should communicate with at least five separate fur salons prior to purchasing a coat.


Visit each store and compare what you can get for the same amount of money at each.
Visit stores other than department stores. Many department store fur salons are run by the same company and have very similar selections and prices as a result. Check out a few independently owned stores, as well.;
, A quality coat should list where the fur originated from, and the highest quality coats will have fur that originates from certain countries.


Look for a mink coat with pelt origins in the USA, Denmark, or Finland. Mink coats from Norway, Sweden, China, Canada, and Russia come next.
Search for sable that originated in Russia and lynx pelts that originate from North America.
Purchase a fox fur from Finland.
Look for a Canadian origin for beaver furs.
 The highest quality coats often come from Europe and North America. Most furs come from China, however, and you may still find a quality coat manufactured there.
 Most quality furs have an open hem at the bottom of the lining for this purpose.


Note how clean the stitches are, and whether or not any fur got caught between the stitches.
Check how much leather was used in the let-out process. Lower quality furs have an underside striped with leather, while the highest quality furs have no leather at all. Ask how much leather is included in the coat to create the most accurate assessment.
Note the color of any leather used on the underside. If you select an un-dyed coat, the color of the leather should also be natural. Mink, for instance, should naturally have a creamy off-white leather.
 Dye does not harm fur in any major way, but it does impact the texture of the fur. The highest quality furs are typically un-dyed.
 Not all quality furs come from known designers, but a designer label does suggest that you have a high quality fur in your hands.

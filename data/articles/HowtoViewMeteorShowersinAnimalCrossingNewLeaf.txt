 The exact dates that meteor showers take place aren't clear ahead of time, so you have to act quickly if you see an announcement.;
, If the weather is clear between 10AM and 11AM, a note might appear on the town's signboard announcing a meteor shower. Meteor showers occur between 7PM and 4AM.
 When a meteor shower is happening, stars will occasionally fly across the sky when you look up. To wish on one, press the Up button on the D-pad and wait for a star to appear. Press A when you hear one twinkle, and if you time it right, the star will make a sparkling noise and shine brighter.


The next day, you'll get a letter from Wishy with a present attached.

 Salabrasion is the term for rubbing a salt solution onto your skin, thereby heating it, and scraping the top layers of skin away, as well as the unwanted tattoo.Salabrasion is an ancient method for removing tattoos, first developed in the Middle East, but modern methods like selective laser removal and dermabrasion are much more effective at removing the tattoo and will prevent excessive scarring of the affected area.The rubbing of your skin with salt will lead to damage to the top layers of your skin or epidermis, as well as very visible scarring. This method can be detrimental to sensitive skin and is not a verified remedy for removing a tattoo successfully., Removal creams are the cheapest and least painful method of tattoo removal: however, their effectiveness depends on regular, diligent use. The Tattoo Removal Institute recommends a couple different creams that may be effective, including TatBGone and Tattoo-OFF.These creams can be expensive and will require 3 to 9 months to fade the tattoo.Keep in mind creams are not as effective as professional removal methods and should be used with caution.
 TCA or trichloroacetic acid can be used as a chemical skin-peeling agent in at-home removal kits, and could lighten the appearance of the tattoo. However, TCA can lead to health risks like serious burns and injuries due to the application of acid on your skin.While at-home removal kits containing TCA and other skin bleaching agents like hydroquinone or alpha arbutin are a cheaper alternative to professional tattoo removal, their effects will be minimal at best and could cause other serious medical issues.

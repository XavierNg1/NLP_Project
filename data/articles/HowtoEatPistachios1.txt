 If there is already a crack in the nutshell, then your job will be much easier. First, squeeze the two half-shells to widen the crack until it won't get any bigger. Then, peel the pistachio open from the crack. Wedge your thumbnails into the crack and pull them apart in opposite directions. Use your forefingers to brace the nut so that you can apply more force to the shell.Try using an already-opened shell half to pry open a new pistachio. The shells are sturdy enough that you can use them to open one other.;
, The pistachio is more difficult to open if the crack is very small, or if there is no crack at all. Place the pistachio on a clean, sturdy surface like a plate, a counter-top, or a cutting board. Then, gently tap the nut with a hammer or another heavy object until a crack forms in the shell. Finally, use your thumbnails to pull the shell all the way open.


Use a nutcracker, if you have one. The nutcracker is a tool specifically designed to open up thick nutshells. Place the pistachio between the two arms of the nutcracker, then squeeze the two arms shut to crack the nut.
 You can buy the nuts already opened, if you like, which makes them somewhat easier to eat. However, be aware that pistachios sold in the shell are typically less expensive. They may also be more likely to be organic.


Studies have shown that eating pistachios in the shell slows down the eating process and lowers overall consumption. Pistachio nuts contain three to four calories each—fewer than almost any another nut—but it can be easy to eat a lot of them when they come pre-shelled. Consider keeping pistachios a "slow" snack by de-shelling them yourself.

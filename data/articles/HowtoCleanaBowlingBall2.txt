 This kind of deep cleaning is known among bowlers and pros as "pulling the oil out of the ball." Basically, this removes oil that has sunk deep into the pores of your ball over the course of many games. The number of games you should wait before deep cleaning will depend entirely on how frequently you play and the lanes you play on.


When playing on oily lanes regularly, you may want to have the oil pulled from your ball every 50 games. Better regulated lanes might only require your ball to be deep cleaned every 70 - 100 games.
When you start noticing the action of your ball on the lane to change, it's probably time for a deep cleaning., You'll want to use a waterproof tape to do this. Water that gets into the finger holes of your ball can harm its performance. Apply the tape over the holes and smooth it so it is flat and there are no gaps in the tape.


To ensure that no water gets into your finger holes, you may want to use an additional piece of tap per hole., Oil is lighter than water, so it and any accompanying dirt will lift from the surface of your ball when soaked in warm water. To allow the water enough time to work into the pores of your ball, soak your ball for 20 minutes., After your ball is finished soaking, it should be mostly clean. To prevent water on the surface of your ball from dripping into finger holes, keep the tape on the ball and use a clean, lint free towel or rag to dry the ball. When the ball is mostly dry, remove the tape and dry it again to remove any remaining moisture.

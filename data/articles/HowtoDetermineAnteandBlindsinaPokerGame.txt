 Use dollar or euro values, even if it's a money-free game. The more different colors of chips you have, the better. If you can get your hands on five or six different colors so you can have chips with values of 1 or 5 and still have a total in the thousands.;
, This should be a percentage, based on the number of people left in the game, of total chips in circulation.


Ten handed: the ante should be minuscule. So small that it is hardly felt - only 0.02% of the total.
Nine handed: 0.04%.
Eight handed: 0.1%.
Seven handed: 0.2%.
Six handed: 0.4%.
Five handed: 0.8%.
Four handed: 1.5%.
Three handed: 2.5%.
Two handed: 15%.
 Since the blinds move around the table, the sting of the big blind should be felt.


Ten handed through six handed: the big blind should be twice the ante.
Five handed: 1.5 times the ante.
Four handed: 2%
Three handed: 3%
Two handed: no blinds

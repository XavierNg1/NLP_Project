 If you sense an argument building, own up to any mistakes you’ve made. Sometimes that’s all it takes to transform your friend from angry to agreeable. Plus, saying you’re sorry will position you to receive an apology too, if warranted.For example, if you were late to meet your friend for lunch, then you might say something like, “I am sorry for being late for our lunch date! I feel really bad about keeping you waiting.”

, If things are still going south, don’t bring up prior disagreements. Therapists say ‘stockpiling’ issues from previous arguments and then unleashing them later aggravates the situation.To bring a swift end to an argument stay focused only on the subject at hand.


For example, don’t bring up something that happened three years ago as extra ammunition during an argument. Just focus on the problem at hand.
 When things are turning tense, look for points of compatibility. Getting back to ‘normal’ in a relationship can sometimes be as simple as reminding the other person that you agree much more than you disagree.


For example, you could recall your shared dislike of handlebar mustaches, have a laugh and move on.
If the point of disagreement is something more serious, then you might try to find something about your values that bonds you together. For example, you might remind your friend that you both value nature conservation, even if you don’t always agree about the best way to accomplish it.
 If tempers are rising suggest a short break from the conversation. Anger can sometimes cause us to say things we later regret. Also, it gives you both useful time to process your thoughts and emotions.Try telling your friend something like, “I really want us to talk about this, but I think we should wait until we are both feeling more relaxed. Do you want to talk about it tonight after our aerobics class?”

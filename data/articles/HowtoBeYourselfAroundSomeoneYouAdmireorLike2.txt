 If youâ€™re going to meet someone you admire or like for the first time, make sure you have researched a bit about them. This will help you know how to connect to them.You may also want to prepare by listing out your good qualities on a sheet of paper before the meeting. This will remind you that you are worthwhile too, no matter how the interaction goes.If you're around someone you like you may want to look on their social media to see what they like, or by asking a mutual friend.
 It may be tempting to lie about connections, positions, or even personality qualities in order to make yourself look better to someone you like or admire. However, simply put, with the internet, it is often easy to find out any lies, especially if you are going to have a working relationship with the person for any amount of time. Secondly, when you lie about your abilities or personality, it can make you less confident about yourself, and make the interaction even more tense.For someone you like and may want to date, it is especially important not to lie, as dishonesty can quickly destroy trust in a relationship.
 Finding something in common is one of the quickest ways to make a connection. While the research you have done about them will help you with this, it is important not to mirror them too much, as this will make you seem creepy. However, simply talking over a recent show or book that has come out can foster conversation. Talking about common interests can help connect you with a crush as well.

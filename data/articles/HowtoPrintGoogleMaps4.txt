 If you can't print using the built-in printing methods above, you can take a screenshot of the map in your browser and print it using an image editing program.
 The method varies depending on whether you're using Windows or Mac.


Windows - Make sure your browser window is selected and press Alt + PrtScn. This will save a screenshot of the active window to the clipboard.
Mac - Hold Command + Shift + 4 and press Space. Your cursor will change to a camera. Click the browser window with the map that you want to print. The image will be created and placed on your desktop.
 When you take a screenshot in Windows, it is copied to the clipboard and will need to be pasted in another program before you can see it. You can use the free Paint program that comes with every copy of Windows.


Click the Start menu or button, type "paint", and press Enter.
Press Ctrl + V or click Edit → Paste to paste the screenshot onto the canvas.
 If you are using a Mac, open the image that was created on your desktop when you took the screenshot. If you are using Windows, use the print function in paint to print. Click File → Print and set your printing options. Send it to your printer when you're satisfied.


You'll likely want to make the map grayscale to save your color ink.
Landscape orientation may make the map easier to read.

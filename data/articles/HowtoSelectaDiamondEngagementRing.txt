Color - It is a myth that all diamonds are colorless. While most diamonds appear white, all include trace amounts of yellow. Colorless diamonds typically hold the most value, with nearly colorless following suit. However, deeply colored fancy diamonds can sometimes cost more than colorless diamonds of the same carat weight. Fancy diamonds are popular in many celebrity engagement rings and come in a variety of colors, such as pink, grey, yellow and orange.

Carat - Diamond size is measured by weight in carats. Prices rise as carat weight increases. Choosing a slightly smaller carat weight, can save you money and still allow you to present your future spouse with a dazzling diamond.

Clarity - Most diamonds have tiny flaws called inclusions, often invisible to the naked eye. Pay special attention to product details when deciding. Most diamonds do contain some blemishes inside the stones and these are what give each diamond its own uniqueness. The most important thing to remember about clarity is that you do not want inclusions to be visible to the naked eye, nor should they be so excessive that they affect the diamond's brilliance or durability.

Clarity is a critical C and has a great effect on the diamond's value. When diamonds are moved up on the clarity scale, you generally see a significant increase in price. The object is to choose a diamond as high on the clarity scale as your budget will allow, while still taking the other C's into account.



Cut - The cut of a diamond determines how well a diamond reflects light to shows its brilliance. A standard report describes cut by the shape or outline of the diamond and the facet arrangement, also known as cutting style. Shapes range from traditional round to hearts, pears, emerald, and more. Choose a shape that reflects the tastes of the person who will wear the stone. Cut becomes very relevant when zeroing down on the choice of diamond. The cut is the result of transforming the diamond into a gem. A better cut will have a great effect on the beauty of the diamond. Diamonds with correct proportions better refract the light out of the top of the stone. Lesser cut diamonds allow some light to escape from the bottom of the stone, resulting in a less brilliant diamond.

Shape - Another factor you need to consider when choosing a diamond is its shape. Although shape and cut are sometimes used interchangeably, they are not the same. Cut refers to the proportions and symmetry. Shape, on the other hand, refers to the actual shape or contour of the diamond. There are 8 popular shapes including: round (also called brilliant cut), Princess cut, Emerald cut, Asscher cut, Marquise cut, Radiant cut, Pear cut, and Heart cut. When you select a shape, the most important factor is simply what appeals to you.
 Before purchasing, check if the diamonds are certified or not. Some of the most accurate/popular diamond grading labs include Precision Gem Grading Laboratory (PGGL), Gemological Institute of America (GIA), European Gemological Laboratory (EGL), and International Gemological Institute (IGI). Only purchase conflict-free diamonds - otherwise someone may have been murdered to bring you the symbol of your love.

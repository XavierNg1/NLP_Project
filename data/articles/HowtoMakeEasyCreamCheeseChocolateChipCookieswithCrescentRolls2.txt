 Use a spatula to easily move the mixture over the entire dough rectangle. Make sure you leave a gap of approximately ½ inch around all sides.
 If you love your chocolate chips, add a little extra.


For a little extra excitement combine chocolate chips with peanut butter or even chocolate mint chips.

 Make sure the slices are uniform so the cookies bake uniformly.
 Check cookies for a golden brown color.

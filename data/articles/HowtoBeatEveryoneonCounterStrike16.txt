 The opponent's main aim is to kill you as soon as possible. Try to avoid an open gunfire.;
, Not doing so will increase your chances of being killed. Even if an enemy suddenly comes near you, keep moving to make it difficult for the enemy. If needed, switch to your pistol so that you can move faster.


If you are using a riffle, it might be easier for you to hide at a secret spot and aim at the enemy from there.
 Choosing the right gun is very important.


If you are a counter-terrorist, and like to fire a lot, try buying one of the Sub-Machine Guns (SMGs) or a machine gun.
Riffles will power you to aim accurately but will decrease your mobility.
If you are a terrorist, try using an AK-47 or similar guns. These allow you to move with an average speed and the guns are easy to use.
 A Kevlar vest and helmet gives you additions resistance against gunshots, knife-attacks, etc.
 If your aim is not good yet, shoot for the chest. Hits to the head are an instant kill, but the chest is a bigger target. It's better to hit the chest than miss the head.

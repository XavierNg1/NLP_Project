 It's the computer monitor icon likely found on your desktop.


On some versions of Windows, "My PC" is called "My Computer".
If you can't find "My PC" on your desktop, type "My PC" into the Start window's search bar and then click the computer monitor icon when it pops up.
 It's under the "Devices and drives" heading in the middle of the "My Computer" page.


On some Windows versions, the hard drive will say "OS" above it.
 This option is at the bottom of the right-click menu.
 You'll see this option at the top of the "Properties" window. Doing so will open the hard drive's "General" page, which lists attributes such as total storage.
 The "Used space" section displays how many gigabytes of your hard drive are taken up by your files, while the "Free space" shows you the number of gigabytes left on your hard drive.


You may notice a discrepancy between the total number of gigabytes listed on your hard drive and the number of gigabytes that was advertised when you bought the computer. This is because a certain portion of your computer's hard drive is used to store the computer's operating system; therefore, that space is irreversibly used, and thus, unlisted.

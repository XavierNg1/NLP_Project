 It's important to be aware that Sweet Shrub lasts a long time and can be quite invasive. As a result, you may prefer it in a large garden as it may spread too wide if you only have a smaller patch.

Sweet Shrub is a prolific seed producer but the plant tends to spread by putting out suckers that root themselves. You may want to be vigilant about that if you want to control the plant in your own garden.



 


Also take care that it doesn't invade your neighbors! Pinch out suckers in the spring to contain the plant’s spread.

, Sweet shrub plants not only spread widely, they can also grow very tall; some gardeners report varieties ten feet tall but 3–8 feet (0.9–2.4 m) tall is more common for a mature plant. They are also long-lived.
 Sweet Shrub isn't fussy about the kind of soil it grows in, but it will do best in a moist, rich soil with plenty of room for growth.

Avoid boggy locations or anywhere puddles tend to linger after rainfall. The plant won’t mind a clay soil.






Sweet shrub also has a slight preference for neutral or slightly acid soil.
 Sweet Shrub will grow in both sun and shade but usually favors shady locations. Sweet Shrub plants grown in full sun will grow more slowly and won’t reach the same height as shade-grown plants.In nature the plant would grow in woody areas, so it thrives best in dappled shade.


If you have a patch of trees in your yard that offer partial shade, consider planting Sweet Shrub underneath.
 Many people like to plant the Sweet Shrub bush in proximity to a house, seating area or pathway to fully benefit from the scent. It’s also common to plant them under windows to enjoy the fragrance inside the house.

 On a personal account, look on the right hand column of your home page, and next to 1 or 2 ads it will say "Create an Ad." Choose 1 of your most popular items to experiment with Facebook's advertising system.


You can create a "Sponsored Story" or a "Facebook Ad." A sponsored story allows you to advertise content that was posted on Facebook, while a Facebook Ad will advertise a particular business or product.
 Try to post your website name in your original post. Even if someone doesn't click on your ad, they may go to your website to find out more about similar products or visit your Facebook Fan page.
 Facebook ads are advantageous because they allow you to target your ideal client. Facebook ads usually have you pay per click, and you can set a time frame to test your ad out.
 Study the results after a month or 2 to decide if Facebook ads work well for your products. If not, you have probably created some brand awareness, and you can open up that advertising money to use on other sites.

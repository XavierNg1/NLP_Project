 Play the popcorn mini game to get some popcorn, go into the theater, select a video to watch (they aren't actually movies), and enjoy the show! During the movie say, ": munches on popcorn :" until the popcorn icon disappears. When the popcorn disappears, say, ": finishes popcorn :". Then watch the show (which will be a short nature film) until the 'movie' is done! Then, if you want to, say something like "That was a great movie!" or, "I loved that movie!" Then you can either watch another movie or you can follow the next step(s).

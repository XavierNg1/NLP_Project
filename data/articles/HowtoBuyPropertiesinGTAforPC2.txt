 This can be done by either double-clicking the GTA San Andreas shortcut icon on the desktop if you have it there, or by following this Start Menu sequence: Start button >> All Programs >> Rockstar Games >> Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.
 Press Enter repeatedly to skip through the pre-game animations till you arrive at the Main Menu. Click “Start Game” and then “New Game” to start GTA: San Andreas from the beginning, or click “Load Game” to load a previously saved file and continue from there. This will enter you into the game world.
 Walk (use the W, A, S, and D keys to control the character) to the nearest car you can find and press F or Enter to enter it.


Drive around the city (use the same keys as walking to control the car) on the lookout for these properties. A property on sale will have a green icon of a house in front of it and a price indicated on top of the icon.
 Once you see a property you like, get out of the car by pressing F or Enter, and then walk and stand in the green icon. A message will appear on the top left-hand corner of the screen instructing you to press Tab in order to purchase the property for its price.


Hit the Tab key to purchase it. A message and an animation will be played on the screen to confirm that you have purchased the property. The money will be deducted from your in-game cash, which is displayed on the top right-hand corner of the screen.
Purchasing properties is one of the things you must do if you want to complete the game. The other one is completing missions.

 Even if you are using a gel icepack intended for medical purposes, you still want to wrap it to protect your skin.If you do not have a cloth or towel large enough to cover the icepack, you can wrap a strip of elastic bandage over your hand and wrist instead. Do this before putting on the icepack if you do not have a cloth or towel.
If you do not have an icepack, you can make your own by putting ice into a plastic bag and sealing it.
 Place the icepack on your sprain and leave it there for 20 minutes, then take it off. Repeat this step every 3 to 4 hours.If the ice pack will not sit on your wrist, you can secure it with a strip of elastic bandage.
 Prop your wrist up on a flat surface, such as a table or armrest. Be sure that it is above the level of your heart, and in a comfortable position. You will be leaving it in this position for 20 minutes.


For extra comfort, try adding a pillow or a soft towel under your wrist.

 Undigested once food gets sent to the large intestine, where gas enzymes break it down and produce flatulence. The process is described in depth below:


First, you place food in your mouth where saliva and chewing break down the food into small, manageable pieces. The food travels from your mouth through your esophagus. The esophagus does little to break down food, merely serving as a "pusher" moving the food down to your stomach.
Next, your stomach breaks the food down into a liquid mess. What it can break down is usually absorbed through the stomach walls such as sugars and energy.
Third, the food travels into your small intestine where it is further broken down and the rest of chemicals and compounds are absorbed into your bloodstream.
Finally, whatever is left over — at this point, waste — moves into your large intestine and is essentially sorted into liquid and solid waste, ready to be expelled from the body.;
, Enzymes break down the food on a molecular level, creating gas as a by-product. Over time, this gas will build up and must be expelled as it will not absorb into the body.

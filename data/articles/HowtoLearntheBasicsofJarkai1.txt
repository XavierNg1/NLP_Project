 Most Jedi prefer to wield a shoto - a short (~60cm blade) lightsaber - in their off hand, as it is easier to maneuvre.Â You can wield two shotos or two full-length lightsabers if you prefer. Some Jedi used a guard shoto - a shoto with a handle coming out of the side, like a police baton.
 You can wield both blades with either a standard or a reverse grip, or do one of each. As the shoto is easier to maneuvre, if you have one, I would recommend using it for the reversed grip., Ataru and Niman are particularly suited for dual blades, but they can also be applied to the other forms. Start slowly so that you don't stab yourself with your own lightsabers, then build up speed when you're more confident., If you lose your second blade, you'll be in big trouble. Practise with only one blade at least as much as you practise with both., If you use dual blades, you cannot use a two-handed grip. This means that your blocks and attacks will be weaker than usual. If you're inside, dual blades are harder to maneuver within the confines of the walls., One of the worst things you can do in Jar'kai is accidentally block your own attack with your second blade.

 Heat the peanut oil in a wok or a large skillet over a medium-high heat. The oil is hot enough when it shimmers.;
, Add the minced garlic and ginger to the wok and cook for one minute.
 Add the chicken to the wok in a single layer and cook until golden brown. Try not to disturb the chicken while it cooks, simply flip it over once, halfway through cooking, to ensure that it browns evenly on both sides.


The chicken is cooked when it is golden brown on the outside and white in the center.
Once the chicken is cooked, transfer to a plate lined with a paper towel.
 Add another 1/2 tablespoon of peanut oil, if necessary. Add the diced and sliced onions, carrots and peppers to the wok and cook for two minutes. Then add the sugar snap peas, the corn and the broccoli florets.


Always keep the food moving, stirring with a wooden spoon, until all of the vegetables are tender.
 In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch, soy sauce and chicken broth. Mix well to ensure that no lumps of cornstarch remain.


Optionally, you can add in an extra tablespoon of flavoring such sake, rice wine or an Asian bottled sauce.
 Place the chicken back in the wok and add in the sauce. Stir to combine the vegetables and chicken, and to ensure everything is evenly coated in the sauce. Reduce the heat to medium and continue to stir-fry until the sauce thickens slightly.
 Cook the rice, noodles, or whatever you intend to serve the stir-fry with. Once the rice or noodles are cooked, you can mix them in with the stir-fry, or serve the stir-fried chicken and veg on top.
 Garnish the stir-fry with the topping of your choice - chopped nuts (such as cashews), finely sliced scallions, raw bean sprouts or chopped fresh herbs are all good options.

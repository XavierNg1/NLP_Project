 Before you transport your favorite slow cooked meal to a dinner party or event, make sure that you fully cook and heat the food. To ensure that food does not spoil during transport, it is best to make sure the food is hot and ready to serve. Food should not dip below a temperature of 165 degrees fahrenheit (74 degrees celsius).Bring a thermometer so that you can check the temperature of the food throughout transportation and before serving.;
, In order to keep the slow cooker warm during transport, you should line a cardboard box or plastic bin with towels. This will help to insulate the slow cooker. It will also provide extra padding and help prevent the slow cooker from shifting and spilling while being transported., Another way to keep your food warm is by covering the slow cooker with aluminum foil. This can provide added insulation to the slow cooker and will also help to prevent the contents from slopping while in motion.


Pace aluminum foil over the lid and down the sides of the slow cooker.

 If you don't get in contact with someone who is with them, as long as they can keep a secret and keep you informed of where they are. If you have no way of finding out, just guess. And if they are already home, just 'surprise stop by!';
, That is if they still live with them, it's always good to inform the adult of this. They may be too tired from the trip, just double check with them first.
 Find out, for instance if they like sea turtles; get some sea turtle napkins, and paper plates. Maybe play pin the tail on the turtle? Or custom make a turtle cake.
 It's good to set a date with everyone you're inviting beforehand. That way they can check to see if they can go, and be able to make sure that they can go and set the date in stone.
 A couple hours before they get back home, invite the friends over. Have them help you decorate their house with you. Set things up, and maybe if they can bring a few extra things or props.
 No party is good without some chips, soda, cake and music! You should find out their favorite song to play when they walk in too.
 Just be casual and when you see them come in tell everyone to hide, and make sure one person is in charge of playing the music when they walk in.
 It should be really fun. You could even have a sleep over at their house, or invite everyone over to your own.

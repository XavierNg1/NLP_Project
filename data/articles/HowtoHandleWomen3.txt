 Regardless of the nature of the relationship, be thoughtful and consider her unique personality and the characteristics that make her special. Making a decision to accept your differences, whether they are based on gender or not, will likely help you with building positive relationships throughout your life., As with any relationship, being forthcoming and not playing games will get you a lot further than being dishonest.


In the beginning of a relationship, you do not have to put all of your cards on the table right away because you might scare her away. However, if you feel like both of you are moving at the same pace, you can share your feelings and encourage her to do the same.
 Shine a light on her accomplishments and show her that you are proud of what she has achieved.


Kind words, a nice greeting card, or a gift are all ways to celebrate her achievements.
 Show that you respect the relationship by viewing situations from her perspective to better understand how she feels. For most people, perception is reality, so examining situations from her perspective is a great way to be more empathetic.


Set aside your point of view and be open to another perspective.
 Instead of constantly questioning her motives, assume the best about her. If you become suspicious about a situation, do not automatically assume that she is guilty, but instead, respectfully share your concerns to get clarification or more information to better understand the truth.

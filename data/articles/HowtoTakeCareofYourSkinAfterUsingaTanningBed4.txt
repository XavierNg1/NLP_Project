 Your skin may become itchy or develop bumps after using a tanning bed for a variety of reasons:Your skin has become overheated from the tanning bed.
You are suffering from polymorphous light eruption, which causes red bumps to appear on the skin after exposure to UV light.You are having a reaction to the products used to clean the tanning bed.
You may be sensitive to the “tan-accelerating” lotion you use while tanning.
You may be taking a medication (such as birth control, acne medication, or even Advil) that makes your skin more sensitive to UV light.
You may have a skin infection from a poorly cleaned bed.
, You will want to be sure that the drugs you are taking are not making your skin more sensitive to light before returning to the tanning salon., If it does not, you should see a doctor. If it does, you can return to the tanning salon and try to determine and eliminate the cause of the rash.Apply a small, diluted amount of the cleaner used by the tanning salon to a tiny patch of your skin to see if a rash forms.
Next, try tanning without the tan-accelerating lotion to see if it was the cause.
Finally, try tanning for shorter amounts of time, which should eliminate the possibility of heat rash.
 If you continue to develop rashes after tanning, you may be experiencing polymorphous light eruption or might even have developed a UV allergy.Talk to your doctor, and be sure to wear sunscreen when outdoors. Discontinue the use of tanning beds and consider using tanning lotions instead if you want a bronzed look.

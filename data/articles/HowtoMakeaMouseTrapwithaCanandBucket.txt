 Wash it out so the flavor is all gone. Remember you want the mice to come to the trap, not move away.
 The holes should be large enough to put a small stick or round piece of wood through., The stick or piece of wood should be small enough to let the can roll loosely. It should also be long enough to sit on top of a bucket., Try to spread it near the middle so the mouse has to climb on top of the can to get to it. Make sure you spread enough to attract the mouse., For a trap that will be fatal, fill the bucket with water. If you want to make a live trap, use a taller bucket., You might have to wait a few days before you catch anything. Check the trap 3-4 times a day., Make sure to wear disposable gloves and to avoid touching the mouse with your skin.

 If you’re a seasoned drinker, your body is more practiced at breaking down and metabolizing alcohol, which means you can drink more with fewer side effects. If you’re a newer drinker, the same will not hold true. Listen to your body and stop drinking as soon as you start to feel buzzed.It is possible, although not always recommended, to increase your tolerance through practice and repetition. Make sure to always drink responsibly.
If you take a break from drinking, your tolerance will not be the same. Be aware of what your tolerance is at the time, and drink based on that.
 Drinking is a marathon, not a sprint. Try to spread your drinks out throughout the evening, as opposed to lining them up one after another. See how long you can nurse one drink. Take a break to order dinner or a snack. Pacing yourself is not only good for your brain, it’s also good for your wallet. The fewer drinks you buy, the less money you’ll spend. Try bringing a set amount of money to a bar, so that you can only spend a predetermined amount of cash on drinks.
Try only allowing yourself one drink per hour. This will make it easier for you to remember how many drinks you’ve had throughout the evening and will keep you from getting too drunk too quickly.
 Different people are built differently, so it stands to reason that alcohol will affect different people in different ways. A 5’2” woman will not (generally) be able to hold her liquor as well as a 6’5” man. Don’t try to keep up with other drinkers; listen to your own body and go at your own speed.Alcohol absorption is dependent on fat levels. The more fat you have, the slower your alcohol will absorb.
If your blood alcohol level is at .08 (the legal limit) it will take five hours for you to burn off the alcohol completely.

 If you are decorating it for the holidays, keep the actual holiday in mind. Try a mini tree for Christmas, a heart-shaped topiary for Valentine's Day, and a bunny for Easter.The taller, thinner the item, the better. They will help keep the eye traveling upwards.
Flowers, figurines, and candles all make great top tier choices.
 Little collectibles, souvenirs, and knickknacks make great fillers, especially if you have a few large items on your tiers already.Don't get too carried away, however; if you only display small items, your tiers will look too busy and messy.
 If you are filling your tray with items that you use often, consider adding in some decorative items as well. Great choices include little figurines and bud vases.Try a glass with a sprig of your favorite herb in it. Then it becomes both decorative and functional!

, When filling your tray, it is easy to fall into a pattern and place like items with like. While there is nothing wrong with organization, too many blue or metal items on one tier can look a little boring. If you have too many items of the same color (or material) on one shelf, switch them around. This will help lead they eye around.


This same rule applies to size: play around with placing large and small items next to each other.

 Cut the Velveeta cheese brick with a sharp kitchen knife. The resulting cubes should each be about 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) in every dimension.


Make sure that the cubes are all evenly sized to ensure even melting.
Small cubes are better than large ones since they melt quicker.
 Arrange the cubes of Velveeta cheese in a medium to large microwave-safe dish and pour up to 7 Tbsp (105 ml) of milk over them. Cover the dish with a lid or a piece of microwave-safe plastic wrap.


The use of milk is strongly advised for this method since it prevents the cheese from burning in the microwave. Furthermore, the milk creates a much smoother sauce.
 Place the dish in the microwave and cook the mixture on high for 30 seconds. Stir the contents of the dish, then microwave it again for another 30 seconds. Repeat as needed until the cheese melts down into a smooth sauce.You may need to microwave the Velveeta for up to 2 or 3 minutes total.
Frequent stirring is necessary if you want to prevent the cheese from burning as it melts.
 The Velveeta cheese product should be served or otherwise used as soon as it comes out of the microwave. If you let it sit out too long or attempt to refrigerate it, the Velveeta will start to solidify again.

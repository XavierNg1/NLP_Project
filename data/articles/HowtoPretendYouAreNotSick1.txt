 If you want everyone to think that you’re not sick, it’s important that your energy level appears normal. An easy way to trick people into thinking you’re okay is to maintain a healthy level of energy. Try to say everything with enthusiasm, and stay away from mumbling.Be aware of the tone and pitch of your voice. Having a sore throat might complicate this, but avoid sounding monotone.;
, If someone realizes that there’s something wrong with you, it’s important to change the direction of their inquiries. You can blame it on the bad weather, car issues, something at work, or something personal.


If someone asks you if there’s anything wrong, you can reply by saying “Not really, I just had a hard time starting the car this morning and it’s really throwing me off.”
Don’t make an excuse that’s worse than actually being sick. Think of something innocuous and believable.
 Don’t put in physical effort if you don’t have to. While it may aid in making it seem like you’re healthy, being sick can take a physical toll, and it will wear down your endurance and make you feel worse over time.Opt out of physical activity if it’s an option.


If someone asks you to help move something, you can tell them that you hurt your back, or you have a bad knee.
If you are sweating and look exhausted after doing something, it will be a dead giveaway that you’re sick.
Take a break if you’re feeling fatigued and excuse yourself to the bathroom.
 Even if you’re not normally a positive person, maintaining a smile and acting positive will trick people into thinking you’re not sick.


Smiling also may make you feel better throughout the day.The more positive you are, the better the interactions with other people will be.

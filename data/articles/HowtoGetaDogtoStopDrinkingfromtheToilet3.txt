 Warm, stagnant water in your dog’s water bowl is a major reason for why dogs resort to toilet water. By providing fresh, cool water throughout the day, you can prevent your dog from drinking toilet water. Your dog’s water bowl should be washed and refreshed at least twice per day.Add ice cubes or frozen blueberries to the water bowl to keep the water cool and fresh.
Try using filtered water instead of regular tap water.
If your dog frequently drinks from the toilet after emptying their water bowl, this may be a sign of a medical condition, such as diabetes or Cushing's Disease. You should take them to the vet for a check up.
 Your dog should always have access to fresh water. Place several water bowls throughout your house. Place a water bowl in the kitchen, laundry room, and one in the bathroom to serve as an alternate to the toilet water.If your dog plays in the back yard regularly, place a water bowl outside as well.
 Some dogs, particularly older dogs, may develop arthritis in their neck or shoulders. This can make it painful to bend over to reach a water bowl that is sitting on the floor. Try placing your dog’s water bowl on a raised platform so that they do not need to bend very far down to reach the water., Another reason why your dog might be drinking toilet water is because it does not like its bowl. If you use a steel or metal bowl, your dog might dislike the noises or reflections produced by these bowls. If you use a plastic bowl, the plastic could be tainting the water’s taste.Opt for a ceramic bowl. Because these bowls are heavy, they do not move around or make noise while your dog is drinking. They are also easier to clean and do not taint the taste of the water like plastic bowls.
Alternatively, you can purchase a pet fountain. These devices provide a constant source of fresh, running water, which is particularly attractive to dogs.

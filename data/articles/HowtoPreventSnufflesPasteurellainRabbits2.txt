 Rabbits are a prey species and prone to stress. This releases stress hormones, such as cortisol which suppresses the immune system. Elevated stress levels can also cause the snuffles to become worse if your rabbit has it. Work on reducing stress for your rabbit to keep him healthy.Sources of stress include a change in routine, the introduction of another rabbit, visiting the vet clinic, poor diet, overcrowding, or aggression from other rabbits.
To help reduce stress, make sure to feed your rabbit a proper healthy diet, provide adequate clean housing, and give the rabbit plenty of space.
 Make sure the rabbit has a healthy, nutritious diet so that his immune system is strong. A healthy, natural diet contains mainly a good quality green hay. Supplement this with fresh fruit and vegetables every day, along with a small scoop of pelleted food.A rabbit is designed to chew on a high fiber diet, such as grass and herbage. This keeps the teeth ground down and reduces the chances of his teeth overgrowing. A painful mouth or tooth roots that grow up into the nasal cavity can reduce the amount the rabbit eats and make her more liable to infections such as pasteurella.
Limit the amount of pelleted food you feed your rabbit. It is high in calories and low in fiber. This makes the rabbit more likely to become overweight and have overgrown teeth.
 One common cause of stress and a weakened immune system is due to a rabbit’s environment. Avoid overcrowding your rabbits. You shouldn’t own too many, and make sure you have adequate housing and space for the rabbits you own.Your rabbit should be kept in a moderate temperature. Being too hot or too cold can cause stress. Keep them out of the sun, away from drafts, and regulate the temperature in their living spaces.
You should always provide clean drinking water for your rabbit.

 If you are short, you might find standard cuts of clothing do not fit you as well as they should. Try shopping in the petite section of your favorite online or brick and mortar store. Seek out stores and brands that specialize in clothing for shorter men and women. These cuts will likely fit you better than clothing manufactured for people who are not short., Taking a friend along on a shopping excursion means youâ€™ll have an extra pair of eyes when deciding if a particular outfit or pair of shoes is a good fit for your short physique. Try asking a short friend whose style you admire to join you on your next shopping trip.
 High-waisted bottoms can add the illusion of height. You can opt for pants with a high waist. Or if skirts are your thing, try complementing your short figure with a high-waisted skirt., An outfit that incorporates vertical stripes can flatter a shorter figure. Horizontal stripes, on the other hand, can make a small figure appear wider than it is. Try wearing pants, dresses, or skirts with vertical lines., Sometimes shopping in the petite section is not an option. Other times you find a sport jacket or suit that is perfect for you, but whose sleeves or hems might need to be shortened. A tailor can take these new purchases and mold them to your short stature, making you look and feel fabulous.

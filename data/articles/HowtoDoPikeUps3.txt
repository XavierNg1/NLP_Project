 Instead of keeping the full plank position, start on all-fours. Once you start your hip shift backward and upward, straighten your legs at the same time. This will delay the amount of time where pressure and tension are on your core., If you find the top of the V to be difficult, particularly on the abs, try moving repositioning your feet. At the top of the V, when you are experiencing the most stress, shuffle your feet forward towards your hands just a few inches at a time. Continue moving forward until you feel like you can hold the V a little easier.


Moving the feet forward adds extra load to the front of your body, and will increase the weight your shoulders and triceps have to hold steady., Once youâ€™re at the top of the V, make it a bit more difficult by adding a pushup to the process. Instead of a two-count movement, it will now be a four-count movement. Raise from the plank into the inverted-V, then bend your elbows and slowly lower your head towards the ground while maintaining the inverted-V angle. The top of the head will get close to the ground; so, be careful. Then engage your triceps and shoulders, pushing back into the inverted-V. Finally, return to the plank position.

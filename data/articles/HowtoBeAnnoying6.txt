 Call late at night, when your friend is sleeping. If you cannot call that person for the first time, try a few more times. If still you are not connected to that person, try an hour or so later or few hours. Wait until you know your friend is busy to call and continue calling until they answer.


Use different numbers to dial to that person from time to time. This may reduce your chances of being caught, and increase the likelihood that your friend will answer. Put *67 before the number you are calling so the person does not know who it is. Start blabbing and repeat the same things multiple times. If they ask who you are, keep blabbing.
Call your boss at two a.m. to "just talk." Wait for your pink slip.
 Don't say anything when the line between that person and you are connected, just keep listening to them repeatedly, "Hello? Hello? Hello? Who are you? Anyone? Say something!" Breath heavily.


As you are talking, start pressing all of the keys so they beep. It will make the other person mad because of all of the beeping.
When you are not talking, use the buttons to "beep out" your friend.
 When leaving a message, scream at the end. After screaming say "PS" and then something random like "and a partridge in a pear tree!" Singing also works.
 Call a random person and start sobbing hysterically into the phone and say, "I knew this would happen! I knew it was only a matter of time! What am I supposed to do?" If the person says, "I think you have the wrong number", say, "Nobody loves me!" and hang up.


Halfway through your conversation, say in a robotic-type voice "This phone will self-destruct in...' then start pressing a random number key and counting down from 10 as you are pressing the button.
When you pick up the phone, act like the connection broke. Then after ten times, say "Oh, hi." Or if they hang up, call them back and pretend like the connection broke again.

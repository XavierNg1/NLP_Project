 If you’re in a relationship, make sure you have other friends and family available for support. Isolation and loneliness can lead to increased feelings of anxiety. Make it a point to stay in touch with your friends, plan dinners or game nights together, and stay connected by telephone, email, or video chat.Your social life doesn’t have to overlap 100% with your partner’s. Have your own friends and hobbies that you do on your own.
 Anxiety can get out of hand if you don’t carefully take care of your health. For example, a lack of sleep can turn anxious thoughts on overdrive, and substances such as tobacco, caffeine, and alcohol can increase anxiety levels. Some prescription medications and even herbal supplements may also increase anxiety. Make sure that you talk with your doctor about anything you are taking (prescription or over-the-counter). Aim to get seven to nine hours of quality sleep each night as well and be smart about what substances you put in your body and how they affect you.Additionally, aim to eat healthy, nutritious foods as part of a balanced diet.

Exercise regularly to help you cope with stress and relieve anxiety.
Also, be aware that illegal drugs such as, methamphetamine, cocaine, PCP, LSD, and heroine may also negatively impact your body, and if consumed may increase your anxiousness.
 Get in the habit of practicing relaxation on a daily basis. This can help you cope with stress each day instead of letting it add up. Set a time each day for relaxation, such as first thing in the morning or last thing before bed. Find something that interests you and that you feel you can do each day for 10-30 minutes.Do relaxation exercises together with your partner. For example, take a yoga class together.
Try breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindful meditation.

 Fill a shallow tub with just an inch or two of warm water. Never let the baby's head go under water as you bathe him or her; instead, cup your hand or use a container to gently pour water over the baby.


Never leave your baby unattended in the bath. Even an inch or so of water can be life threatening.
Avoid using infant bath seats. According to Safe Kids World wide, eight children per year drown due to the use of infant bath seats. Babies, infants, and children can easily slip out from this and get caught under them or by them, unable to face back to the air.
Do not ever leave your infant or toddler in the care of a sibling in a bathtub. Unless a sibling is 16 years or older, it is not appropriate to place this huge responsibility on a child.
 The toilet lids in your home should be fitted with baby-proof latches. Make sure not to leave buckets of water or other liquids within reach in the kitchen, bathroom, garage, or other areas of the house. Fish tanks, fountains, and other water sources should be covered or well out of reach.


Empty water toys and buckets immediately after using them.
Do not leave standing water in the sink.
 As your baby gets old enough to understand that water can be dangerous, teach him or her the proper way to behave around water sources. Don't let him or her work the water faucets without adult supervision. Make sure older children in your home are also aware of the safety measures that must be taken to keep babies safe from water.

 At some point in the game (once you finish about 7–8 main missions), you will be asked by Miller to create a Combat Unit Platform back at Mother Base. You should then start building as many platforms as possible (you can build up to 4 of each). , Once you’ve built a Combat Unit platform, go ahead and transfer personnel with high Combat Unit compatibility ratings from your other units. Of course, don’t forget to extract more soldiers from your missions or when you infiltrate bases/outposts while free-roaming., Send you combat unit staff on Combat Deployment missions using your iDroid. Go to the Missions tab and look for a Combat Deployment option. Like main missions and side ops, these missions will also give you GMP as well as other resources that your Mother Base needs.

Some of these missions are also helpful in disrupting the supply of weapons (sniper rifles) and equipment (helmets, night vision goggles) to your enemies.
 Your staff’s combat unit rating will affect their chances of succeeding in a mission. Choose staff with B or higher ratings to minimize the projected losses for a specific mission as much as possible., By completing this mission, you’ll get to build your first FOB, or Forward Operating Base. By building an FOB, you can increase the number of Combat Deployment missions your Combat Unit can take.

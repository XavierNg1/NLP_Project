 The most important thing to do is to stay in bed. Don't get up and move around a lot, because if you're sick, running around everywhere will make you feel worse and get everyone else sick too! Rest and sleep are very important. You can even watch TV or read a book to keep you occupied and get your mind off the sickness.
 It is known that fruit juice such as apple juice eases sore throats. Some top two recommended juices are apple juice and orange juice. Be aware that hot apple cider may not help as much.
 Sugar will create an environment where germs can multiply quickly. Drink natural or fresh squeezed juices instead. Lemon-based juice and other high vitamin C content juices will be best.
 They constrict and tighten your passageways instead of easing them.
 They give you phlegm, which causes you to cough more.
 Soothing broth is just what you need. Chicken noodle soup and Top Ramen are both delicious and very helpful for your throat.
 This will really help your throat get better. Kids should take either Motrin or Benadryl. They will make you sleepy, but hey, sleep is just what you need!

, Take some time off your throat issues and take a nap! This is perfectly fine and very helpful.
 It's important that you bundle up, because if you have a cold, sore throat, flu, or fever, you shouldn't expose yourself to coldness, because it could make you more sick.
 Because you're staying home from school or work, you could get a little bored sometimes. If you wrap yourself in a blanket or robe, you could easily go on to the computer (wikiHow!!) or something away from your bed. Things you could do at your bed are: read, write, play some sort of portable video game system, etc.
 Don't eat things like tortilla chips, because this will make your throat feel horrible. Stick to broth, juice, and hot tea.

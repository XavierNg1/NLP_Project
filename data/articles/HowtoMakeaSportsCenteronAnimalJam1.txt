 Go for a nature and simple looking den, like the Ol' Barn, Mushroom Hut, Enchanted Hollow, or the Tree House. Maybe use a Blue Skies or Coral Canyons wallpaper to look like you're outside. Match it with some flower or canyon flooring to make it look like it's more outside.;
, Place "bike racks" by putting bicycles and dirt bikes together to make a rack full of bikes, for people to park and rent for bike riding.


Put long boards and skate boards in a little rack also.
Place trees, both seasonal and epic, and cherry blossom and put them in a natural looking garden withÂ a swing.
 Place pogo sticks, a putting green, a golf bag, and make small benches, with tiny shelves. Put different things with Croquet Sets. This will be your smaller version of sports.
 Put in a basketball, a football, and a soccer ball. Put two soccer goals and two football goals. Try to make a basketball hoop with a pirate chest on the wall. This will be your second area, where major sports will be played.
 Put beach balls for volley balls if they don't have them, and you can play beach, volley, and tennis ball.

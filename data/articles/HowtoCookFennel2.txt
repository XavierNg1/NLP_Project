 Before saut√©ing your fennel, add about an eighth or a quarter cup of olive oil to a skillet. For one bulb use an eighth of a cup. For two bulbs, use a quarter cup. Place your skillet over medium heat.Oil is ready to use when it looks smooth and flows easily like water. The surface should also glisten slightly.If you're still not sure, you can add a small piece of fennel to the oil. If it sizzles right away, the oil is already heated and you can add the remaining fennel.
 Add the fennel to the oil once it's heated. Spread the fennel out so none of the pieces are touching or overlapping. , Stir the fennel on occasion and flip the pieces. You should cook the fennel until it is golden brown. This should take about 10 to 12 minutes., Turn off the heat once the fennel is cooked. Remove the fennel from the heat and drain any excess oil. Salt the fennel to taste. You can also add a splash of lemon juice to add extra flavor.

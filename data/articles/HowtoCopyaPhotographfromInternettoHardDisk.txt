 Online images are often 'thumbnails,' which are smaller, lower-quality copies posted online to allow the whole page to download faster. Usually, simply clicking on the image will open the high-resolution version, which will be much more suitable for printing or enlarging.;
,, Save the file to a convenient place on your hard drive, usually in "My Pictures." Ensure you name it and/or remember the name and where you saved it. Ensure the "File Type" is something your software can work with. Common image file types are .jpg, .gif, .tiff, and bitmaps. Once you hit "Save," you will have the image for use and/or manipulation.


What if it's protected? Almost all images belong to the copyright owner or photographer. Few people really care if you use them around the house or just on your own machine. But when you publish them publicly or try to make money from them, you're opening a real can of legal worms. Sometimes when you right-click on an image, an "image protected" message appears. Seek permission of the webmaster. If that fails and depending on how you intend to use it (see the note on Fair Use below), you can still copy the image.
With the image on screen, hold down the Alt key and press the Print Screen key (or Prt Scr, it's usually up and right of the backspace). This will make a low-resolution copy of everything on your screen.
Open your image editing software or the program you wish to put the image in (if all else fails, try MS Word). Create a new file. Hold down the Ctrl key and press the V key. This will paste your screen image.
Now crop away the unwanted portions.

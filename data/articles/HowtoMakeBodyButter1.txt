 Mango butter is a rich, creamy natural substances that nourishes the skin and has an amazing tropical scent. You can find it at natural food markets or online. You'll need the following ingredients to make about five ounces of body butter:2 ounces (6 grams) cocoa butter
2 ounces (6 grams) mango butter
2 teaspoons shea butter
1 teaspoon wheat germ oil
1 teaspoon aloe vera gel
10 drops mango essential oil;
, Prepare a double boiler, or create a makeshift one by filling a large pot with a few inches of water and placing a smaller pot inside it. Place all of the ingredients except the essential oil into the smaller pot. Turn the burner on low and heat the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the ingredients are completely melted. Continue to heat the mixture for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the oils are completely incorporated and the body butter is smooth with no graininess.


Be sure not to heat the ingredients too quickly, since this could ruin the texture of the different butters. Melt them together slowly, stirring often to make sure the mixture doesn't scorch.
 Give the mixture a chance to cool a bit before adding the essential oil.
 Stir in 10 drops drops of mango essential oil. If you like highly scented body butter, add an extra drop or two of essential oil. If you're sensitive to strong scents, just add 5 drops total.
 To give it a light, airy texture, whip the mixture with a hand blender until the body butter is creamy.
 Label the containers. Store it at room temperature and use it up within six months.

 Safari's icon resembles a blue compass., It's one of the options in the toolbar that's in the top left corner of the screen., Doing so will open Safari's version of incognito mode in which you can browse without Safari remembering your visited sites or downloads.

You can also hold down ⌘ Command and ⇧ Shift and tap N to bring up a new private window.
Safari's Private Window has a darker color scheme than a standard browsing window.

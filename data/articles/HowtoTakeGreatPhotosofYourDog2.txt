 Sometimes it can be hard to catch your dog sitting still. Unless you are taking photos where your dog is sitting still, you will probably want to use Al Servo mode on your digital camera. This mode causes your camera to lock onto the subject, but keeps refocusing so that moving shots won’t come out blurry.If you are photographing your dog when he is sitting still or when using flash, you should use One Shot mode.
 If you are trying to catch your dog in a quick movement, such as in the middle of a jump, you’ll probably want to set your shutter speed to at least 1/250. This will keep the image crisp, and you can capture your dog doing something really cool.Slower shutter speeds may make it difficult to catch your dog in the middle of an action.
Keep in mind that a faster shutter speed will not work well in low light conditions. If you want to take action shots, try to have your photo session on a nice sunny day.
 Most photographers recommend choosing aperture priority mode when trying to photograph pets. This will bring your pet into sharp focus and the less important aspects of the photo (e.g. the tree in the background) will be less focused.On the other hand, if the background is important for the photo, you can always turn aperture priority mode off so that the camera will keep everything in focus.
 You might get a really great shot that is just a bit too dark or that has just one small flaw. Most professional photographers edit their photos using software such as Adobe Photoshop. If you’re not too familiar with all of the settings of your digital camera, you can always set it to Auto and then use an editor to make the photo just right.Be aware, though, that if you set your camera to auto your shutter speed will probably be too slow to catch any action shots. Auto will probably work great in good lighting for portrait shots, but not so well if you’re trying to catch good shots of your dog playing.

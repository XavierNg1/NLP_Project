 Hypothermia, shock, injury and exhaustion mean you cannot be guaranteed that you will swim to safety if an accident did happen. Wear a properly fitted life jacket that supports the neck and will keep your face out of the water if you fall unconscious.;
, Immediately after the accident is when you, as a strong swimmer, are in most danger. You can come back and group together with strong swimmers later but, right away, you are in danger from weak and panicking swimmers who will do anything to try to save themselves. No swimmer, no matter how strong, will manage to get to safety if they are being grabbed by several drowning victims. Remember, you must protect yourself first and foremost.
 Everyday, in preparation, swim for an hour while wearing jeans and a t-shirt. This will help build stamina and speed. If you drown, these are the items you will most likely be wearing.
 To do so, form a huddle position, in which you double over, and try to conserve all your heat.
 Tie the legs of your jeans together, and then fill air in to them. Lift them over your head and pull them towards the water. When they blow up, use it as a buoy.
 This will help conserve body heat, and will enable you to use more resources.
 There you will be able to build a fire, dry yourself, and rest. If this is not possible, limit your movements, and try not to waste energy.
 One hand signifies no, while two mean yes. This way the copter will assume you need help and will rescue you.
 Corny as it sounds, a positive mindset is what several survivors attribute to their success. Repeat mantras such as "My name is John Smith and I am not going to die out here", and sing songs out loud to distract yourself and keep your mind occupied.

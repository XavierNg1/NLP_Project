 Here's where all your options come in and it gets a bit confusing. If you're not keen on tackling this part, you can always hire an electrician. Also: make sure the fixture is turned off!









If you don't have a hanging socket already, you can make one. Or just buy one from IKEA -- they're pretty cheap. Making one is only advised if you have a handle on what you'll be doing. If you think you have it, you'll need:

3 plain canopy kits. That will serve to hold the cable in place and to mount it to the ceiling
1 outdoor-grade extension cord at least 1' longer than you will need
1 porcelain socket with metal cap
2+ twist on wire connectors
Wire stripper/snips



, You'll need a hole at the other end of your globe to initially place it onto the fixture. Make a few snips directly opposite the original hole, but nothing too big. If it's too large, the ball will fall right off!









To support the new hole you just made in your globe and to keep it from breaking under its weight, cut out a plastic ring to go around your bulb, at the top of the fixture. This can be from an old, cheap lampshade or a Tupperware container lid -- anything that can be cut into a ring and has a bit of strength to it, really.
 Place your dome around your bulb and slide in your plastic ring between the globe and bulb. If you don't like the look of the hanging wire, place a shower rod around it before installing your lampshade.









If one side of the ball is more aesthetically pleasing than the other, just rotate it! That's the beauty of the pendant lamp.










Simply remove the wire and bulb set. Grab a can of spray paint and add color.

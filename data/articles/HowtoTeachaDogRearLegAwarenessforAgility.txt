 There are many videos on YouTube specific to certain exercises and tricks.;
, Although these can be quite pricey, you can always take the basic beginner lessons to learn and ask any questions you have about the sport. This is fundamental to your own learning as it isn't just your pooch pal who has to try new things. After this you can begin to buy your own equipment and set up your own practice area.
 Going to lessons is a great way to meet both new and experienced competitors. You can also meet like minded people at the competitions, even if you aren't competing on the day. Many areas have local, free dog agility parks where you can train and talk to people who can tell you about their learning experience.

Slowly start to walk forward, using a hand gesture specific to this command and clearly stating 'Back it up!' The dog will instinctively walk backwards. Once it does this give it a reward. Try to get it to maintain eye contact so it cannot look where its back legs are going.
Once you have this handled, begin to walk less and do the hand and voice command more, until you no longer have to walk for the dog to back up.
Begin to space out rewards, you don't want to always have to give food, but verbal praise can be used every time as motivation.
Narrow it down to either just a hand gesture or just a vocal command.
Once you and your dog are confident with this, start placing stands behind the dog, so it has to step its back legs up while walking back, vary the height of the stands. This will cause your dog to think about what it is doing with its hind half.

 Add a spoonful of water at a time, stirring until all the powder is dissolved. Three tbsp (45 mL) of powder makes a strong-flavored ice cream, but you can use less or more according to your preference.


You can use a shot of espresso instead. Instant coffee powder isn't a recommended substitute, as it tends to taste sour or metallic.;
, Stir until combined. The condensed milk will let the ice cream freeze on its own, without frequent churning.


If you own an ice cream maker, you can replace the condensed milk with 1 cup (240 mL) milk and ½ cup (50g) sugar., For a richer flavor, try adding 1 tbsp (15 mL) espresso liqueur. For a classic ice cream taste and general deliciousness, use 1 tsp (5 mL) vanilla extract instead.

Beat with an electric mixer or a whisk at medium speed, until it forms soft peaks.Chilling the bowl and whisk in the fridge will speed up the process., Transfer the mixture to an airtight, freezer-safe container. Freeze until set, about 6 hours or overnight.Large, metal containers freeze the ice cream faster than small or plastic ones.If you have an ice cream maker, chill in the fridge, then pour in the mixture and follow your model's instructions. This will typically set the ice cream in about 20–30 minutes.

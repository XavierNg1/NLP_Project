, This is the long box on the right of your screen labeled layers. You'll see each layer -- starting with "Background" -- as well as a little thumbnail of the image. Next to Background there should be a small padlock icon that tells you the layer is locked.


'Troubleshooting: I don't see "Layers:" Click on "Window" in the top bar. Make sure "Layers" is checked. If it is, and the palette is still not open, click "Window" → "Workspace" → and hit "Essentials." Still struggling? Reset "Painting" and click that., This is perhaps the safest way to go, since it saves you a perfect original copy if anything goes wrong. For PC users, press Ctrl+J when the background layer is highlighted. For Mac users, it is Cmd+J. Your new layer will be unlocked and ready to edit.


You can also click on "Layers" from the top bar, then click "Duplicate Layer."

, Simply double-click on the title of the layer, "Background" and it will open a little box to recreate the layer. From this box, you can:


Change the name
Set a blending mode
Color code the layer for organization
Set the layer's base opacity, In the top bar, click on "Layer"-- the right option should be near the top. Simple and easy, this also replaces your background layer with a brand new one. You will not have a spare background, just one unlocked section.

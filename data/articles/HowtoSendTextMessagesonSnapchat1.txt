 You can send a text message to any of your Snapchat friends using Snapchat’s Chat feature. Usually you’ll be able to send a message to any of your contacts who lists you as a friend, however some Snapchat users limit how they can be contacted., Everyone you’ve followed is listed on this screen.
 The contact’s name appears at the top of the chat, and you’ll see a box at the bottom that says “Send a chat.”

, If your phone keyboard did not appear, tap where it says “Send a chat” to start typing.


If you’d like, you can tap the photo icon to attach an image to your message.
You can also tap the phone or video icon to make a voice or video call instead of a text message.
 Remember, once they read the message, it will disappear from the chat.


If you want to save the message to your Memories (so you can read it later), tap and hold the message until you see the word “Saved” appear to its left. Your friend can also save the message this way.
To view your Memories, swipe up on the camera screen.

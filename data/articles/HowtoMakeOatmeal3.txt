 You can use any type of bowl you want, but a deeper bowl will hold the heat better than a shallow one; it will also help prevent the oatmeal from becoming too dry and hard.
 If your instant oatmeal comes in a canister, measure out ¼ to ½ cup (20 to 40 grams) of instant oatmeal. This will be enough for one serving.
 Most instant oatmeal already comes flavored, but if it doesn't, you can add your own flavors, such as salt or butter. For more suggestions, click here.
 You can boil the water in a kettle, an electric kettle, or a pot on the stove. You can also boil some water using a coffee maker (just make sure that there is nothing in the filter, or you will get coffee-flavored water).
 The package should tell you how much to add. In general, however, you will need about ½ to ¾ cups (120 to 180 milliliters) of hot water per serving of oatmeal. Stir the oatmeal with a spoon to combine everything.
 The longer you wait, the thicker the oatmeal will become.
 If the oatmeal is too thick, add some water, milk, or cream to thin it. If the oatmeal is too thin, add some more oatmeal. Stir the oatmeal to mix everything together.
 Do not let the oatmeal sit, or it will become too thick and dry. Because most instant oatmeal already comes flavored, all you have to do is give it a quick stir with a spoon and eat it. You can, however, add some toppings to plain instant oatmeal, such as brown sugar, cinnamon, cream, dried fruits, honey, maple syrup, or nuts.

 People who are trying to quit smoking will often be irritable. Know that your boyfriend’s behavior is not about you. However, you certainly have the right to call him out on rude or unkind behavior and to get away from him entirely if this irritability becomes full-fledged abuse.
 This is especially important if you live together. If your boyfriend’s behavior exposes you to second-hand smoke, both of you are at risk for serious health problems. Moreover, people who don’t smoke at home are likelier to quit.Don’t keep lighters or ash trays in your home, either—this will just remind your boyfriend of what he’s avoiding., This will not only further protect your own health, but also—by eliminating potentially triggering settings—help your boyfriend avoid the behavior.
 How important is it to you that your boyfriend quit smoking? While there are steps you can take to help him quit, you will need to think about how you will proceed if he has no interest in doing so.


Think about whether his smoking outweighs all of his other good qualities. Most people have serious flaws, and some experts suggest that having dealbreakers is not really conducive to happiness.The exception here is a serious moral or ethical shortcoming. Smoking does not really fall into this category, but it can prevent a long and healthy life. If losing your boyfriend to health problems down the road sounds too painful, smoking might just be too much for your relationship to overcome.
If his smoking is a dealbreaker, he needs to be aware of it. It's not fair giving him an ultimatum he doesn't know about. Tell him that you cannot be with a smoker, but that you are confident he can quit and want to help him do so.

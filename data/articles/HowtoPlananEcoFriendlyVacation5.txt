 In addition to staying at an eco-friendly place, you can do your part to minimize the environmental impact of your travel. Things you can do to help include:


Reuse bedding and towels. If the hotel offers this as a feature, be sure to do as instructed so that the items are not taken away by cleaners each day.
Recycle all products that are recyclable. If the place you're staying in doesn't seem to have recycling facilities, inquire at the front desk about where you can find them. Most green hotels and resorts will use in-room or nearby recycling bins to assist you.
Only charge as much as needed and then remove the charger from the plug. Once the charger indicates that your batteries have been recharged, leaving them in any longer is a waste of energy.
Wash your clothes by hand in your room or use an efficient local laundromat rather than resorting to dry cleaning services.
Switch off lights and appliances before leaving the room. When in your room, only use those lights and appliances that you really need to use. Perhaps you can open a window instead of turning on the air conditioning, or just use a bedside light instead of the overhead lights.
Treat water as the precious resource that it is. Use only as much as you need to shower/bathe and to clean your teeth and flush. If the hotel or resort is experiencing water shortages, follow the instructions for saving water as indicated by the establishment. Do your bit to ensure that other people can enjoy what you're enjoying.
Share books instead of buying new ones. Once you've read your book, leave it at the place of stay for the next traveler to enjoy. Many places now provide for this exchange of books, allowing you to pick up a new one for free to read as well.

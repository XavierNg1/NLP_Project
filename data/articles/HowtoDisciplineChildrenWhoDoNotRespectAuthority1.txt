 in your face and cover their ears. Remind them you love them no matter what (especially if they deny it), and maintain that outlook so your children become more comfortable with you. Remember that connection brings trust, the basis of respect.;
, Do this even if they are being difficult and argumentative. 


For example, if your girl is being difficult when she needs to clean her room, say something like, "I understand you want to go outside and play than clean your room - cleaning is no fun! But it's one of our rules and when you're all done, you'll be able to play."  
Remember not to force more chores onto them, especially if you made a promise. They may think you are unreliable and you will slowly lose your connection with them.

 Make sure your DS is working properly, and it is a real DS. If you have one, then you're ready to go on this step! A list of the DS consoles:

, You will want your DS to work properly, but make them stylish items to go with it. Important accessories for a stylish DS are:

Case - those moments when you drop your DS.
Stylus - when you need to type on your DS.
Charger - just one of those DS essentials.
 So you've bought the essentials; now is time for some style! Make your DS you! Find what you think is stylish, and buy it! Make your accessories colour coded, or matching, as long as they look good and fashionable! To make your DS have serious style is buying the following:

Screen wipe - when you get an ugly smudge on your screen.
Earphones - if you have an SD card, you can listen to your favourite music.
DS game holder(s) - when you keep losing your games and can't find them, have them all in one place.
Small notepad and pen - jot down codes, or important info from a game.
 So you have all your new items with you, but nowhere to put them. Then now is a good time to buy a bag! All you will need is a small bag, depending on what you've got, and make it stylish, going with your colour code. If you want to be stylish and trendy, then why not buy an actual DS bag, with super cool compartments to store your things in, and is much roomier than a normal small bag.

 If you are grieving a loss, consider going to a grief counselor. If you don't feel ready to date due to low self-confidence, work on strategies like affirmations, helping others, and mastering skills. This way, you can help yourself feel better, and then be happy and ready to date even sooner.

The purpose of this is not to immediately throw yourself back into dating, but to work on anything that needs strengthening, or that is interfering with your long-term goals.
 Spend more time on the relationships that aren't romantic: friends, family, mentors, et cetera. Go out and do things with people you care about, and spend quality time with those who matter most to you., What do you love to do? What have you always wanted to try? Whether it's knitting or rock climbing or editing wikiHow, immerse your time in something that makes you feel productive and happy.

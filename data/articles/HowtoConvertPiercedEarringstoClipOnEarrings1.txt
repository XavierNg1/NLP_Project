 You can buy earring converters online or your local craft store. The converters are usually located in the jewelry making area. Look for a converter that has a small tube/barrel on the back.Most posts will fit into the barrel of the converter, but check the size of your posts just to be sure.;
, Slide the post into the barrel of the converter. Then bend the post about 90Â°. Bending the post will make your earrings have a more natural position on your ear.Use a slow steady motion to bend the posts. If the posts are kind of thick, bend them with pliers before you insert them into the barrel.
Once you bend the posts, the earrings cannot be used as pierced earrings anymore.
 If you do not want to bend the post or would still like the option of wearing them as a pierced earring, you can use a no bend converter. Simply place the post in the barrel and then put the earrings on. The earrings will sit below your earlobe. Pierced stud earrings usually sit around the middle of your earlobe so it may look a little weird if you use this type of converter.Drop and dangle earrings with posts are better suited for no bend converters.

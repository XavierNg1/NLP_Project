 Put on a short summer or springy dress and pair it with cotton leggings that complement the color of the dress. The dress and leggings shouldn't be the same color, obviously, but they should coordinate. For example, if the dress has five different colors on it, just pick leggings that match at least one of the colors.


If your dress is busy with designs, go for solid-colored leggings.
Or do the reverse, you can even wear a solid-colored dress with a pair of patterned leggings and top your dress with a solid colored scarf.
 Pick a skirt that looks good with the leggings. Make sure the color of the skirt and the material don't clash with the leggings. If you're wearing a lose skirt, wear a tight shirt so you don't have too much flouncy material going on.


If your skirt has a pattern, wear plain leggings. If the skirt is plain, wear patterned leggings or leggings that are of a distinct enough color so they don't blend in with the skirt.
 This can be a cute and casual look. Just put on a plain-colored pair of leggings and throw on some denim, white, or black shorts, and you're good to go. The shorts shouldn't be so tight that they blend in with the leggings.


Wear casual shoes with this look. Flats, low boots, sandals, or even sneakers will do.
Wear a long jacket or top and a tight tank top or t-shirt with this look.
Remember that you already have a lot going on when you wear shorts with leggings, so either own it and wear lots of layers, or keep it simple, but don't go for something in between.
If the sweater and boots are a simple, solid color, try some patterned leggings.
 Leggings that are zebra or leopard striped or covered with hypnotic can give you a fun and flashy look. Make sure you wear them with an understated top, skirt, dress, pants or shoes. Let your leggings steal the show and avoid clashing by not having other patterns get in the way of your style. If you're wearing loud leggings and an understated top, pair them with some loud jewelry.

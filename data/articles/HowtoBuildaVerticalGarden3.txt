 Figure out what conditions the plants you're growing need to thrive, then choose a suitable area in your yard or on your patio.


Most vertical gardens do well with a lot of sunlight.
Pick a spot close to a wall if you want your garden to eventually climb the walls of your house.
 If you're using a trellis, a stake or a pole, be sure to bury it deep in the ground so that it doesn't wobble or fall over. Remember that the garden will get heavier as it grows, and it will need a solid foundation that can stand up to wind and rain.


Use a post driver to push your metal or wooden posts deep into the ground.
 Taking into account the individual needs of the plants you are using, plant seeds or seedlings in holes spaced around the base of the trellis, pole or other structure you are using. Make sure they aren't too close to each other or the structure so that they'll have room to root and grow.
 Make sure they get adequate water and that you fertilize them, protect them with mulch, and take other measures they need to grow healthy and strong.
 When the seedlings get a few inches high, it's time to train them to wrap around the structure you erected. Gently wrap the stems of the plants around the base of the structure, taking care not to bend or break them. Use ties to hold the stems in place as they grow.


Don't tie the stems too tightly. This prevents them from growing properly and may actually damage the plant.
As the stems begin to grow and wind around the structure, continue using ties to train them to grow in the direction you want them to grow.
For vines like hops, tie a string to the trellis a few feet above the ground, and stake it to the ground near the plant. Train the plant up the string until it reaches the trellis. If you are using metal or other slick types of materials, run the string all the way to the top so the vines have something to grab onto.

 Bring a large pot of water to boil and add two 16-ounce (456 g) packages of frozen pierogi. Boil the pierogi for 5 to 7 minutes, if you're using regular-sized pierogi. For mini-pierogi, boil them for 3 to 5 minutes. Drain the pierogi in a colander.You can use your favorite flavor of pierogi for the casserole.
 Turn the oven on to 375 degrees F (190 C). Get out a 9 x 13 (23 x 33 cm) baking pan and coat it with cooking spray. This will keep your casserole from sticking to the pan., Measure out 2 cups (450 g) of pizza sauce and pour 2/3 of a cup (150 g) in the bottom of your casserole dish. Place half of the cooked pierogi over the sauce and pour another 2/3 cup (150 g) of pizza sauce over it. Scatter about one ounce (27 g) of the pepperoni slices over the sauce and top it with 1/2 cup (56 g) of the shredded mozzarella cheese.You can add any other pizza toppings to the casserole when you add the pepperoni. For example, try sliced mushrooms, garlic, or sausage.
 Layer the rest of the casserole in the same way. Add another layer of sauce, the rest of the pierogi, ore sauce, the rest of the pepperoni, and the last of the cheese., Put the casserole in the preheated oven and bake it for 15 to 20 minutes. The pierogi should soften more and the cheese will bubble once it's finished baking. Let the casserole cool for 10 minutes before you serve it.Serve the pizza pierogi casserole with a fresh, tossed salad and breadsticks.

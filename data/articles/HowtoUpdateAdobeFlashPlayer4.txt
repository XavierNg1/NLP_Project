 If you do not know for certain whether or not your version of Adobe Flash is up to date, check it by visiting the "Find Version" page on the Adobe site. This page will automatically tell you which version you have and whether or not it needs an update.


This page can be found at: http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/find-version-flash-player.html

If you are attempting a clean update because a previous “quick” update did not go through, you can skip this step, since you already know that your version is outdated.
 The appropriate uninstaller can be downloaded from the following page: http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-mac-os.html


Read through the instructions on the page to determine which uninstaller file is right for your system. Click on the uninstaller file name to start your download.
 Close all open windows and applications to prevent anything from interfering with the uninstalling process. Open the Finder window and mount the uninstaller.


It is strongly recommended that you close out of everything not needed to complete the process to avoid any loss of information or installation errors.
 Double-click the file icon to run the uninstaller. When done, the uninstaller should let you know that the process has been completed.
 Some programs and files will only allow themselves to be removed after the Mac OS X reboots, so even if you do not get an alert box notifying you to restart your computer, you should still do so.
 A few files and folders will need to be removed manually even after restarting your computer. Navigate to the following folders and delete the files and directories:


\Library\Internet Plug-Ins\Flash Player.plugin
\Library\Internet Plug-Ins\flashplayer.xpt
~\Library\Preferences\Macromedia\Flash Player\
~\Library\Caches\Adobe\Flash Player\

, Follow the instructions used in the quick install method for Mac to download the installation file and install the latest version of Adobe Flash. The instructions from this point on are exactly the same as those used in the “quick update” section.

 Use shampoo only a couple times per week.Leave your hair’s natural oils intact for better health. Only lather the shampoo a little bit. If your scalp tends to be very oily and needs more frequent washes, focus on your scalp and roots and leave the rest alone. Avoid over-rinsing, which will further remove your hair’s natural oils.Use a mild shampoo that has no alcohol. Also avoid products made of silicone or its derivatives, which can be identified by the suffix “-cone” on the list of ingredients.These chemicals will create drier hair.
Also be wary of shampoos containing sulfate, which will leave your hair lusterless.;
, Invest in more intensive formulas for the winter months.Before you wet your hair, work in a pre-wash conditioner. Then condition your hair again after every shampoo with a leave-in formula to replenish moisture.If your hair tends to dry out very quickly in general, condition it in between shampoos as well.
 Although a hot shower in cold weather might feel like heaven, be aware that it’s hell for your hair. Before you dunk your head under the stream to treat it, lower the temperature to lukewarm. When it’s time to rinse, lower it again until it’s cool to cold. Use the cold water to seal your hair’s cuticles and prevent its oils from escaping.

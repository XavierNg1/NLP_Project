 Buy a sunscreen that offers "broad-spectrum" protection, which will guard against both UVA and UVB rays. Dermatologists recommend a minimum SPF of 15, but individuals with very fair skin will likely need one with a higher rating., Most sunscreen manufacturers advise to reapply every 2 to 3 hours. However, earlier reapplication is often necessary, especially for people with fair skin. Apply more sunscreen 15 to 30 minutes after any activities that may remove the sunscreen from your skin, such as sweating, swimming, or toweling off., Start out sunning yourself for only about 15 minutes each day. After about a week, work your way up to a maximum of 30 minutes. Stop sessions sooner than planned if you start to burn. While many think that longer, more intense tanning sessions are the quickest way to a great tan, this is not generally true, especially for fair-skinned people. The optimal amount of time in the sun to stimulate melanin production without damaging your skin is only about 30 minutes., Damaging UV rays are at their peak between the hours of 10 am and 4 pm. Instead, tan in the early morning or late afternoon. If you must tan at peak hours, be sure to wear a sunscreen with a high SPF., A wide-brimmed hat will protect your sensitive scalp while letting some diffuse light in to tan your face. Sunglasses will protect your eyes from sun damage, which can lead to cataracts and other vision problems. Don't fall asleep with either on to avoid embarrassing tan (or burn) lines., Your lips can burn just as easily as the rest of your skin. The sun can also dry them out quickly, leading the painful chapped lips. SPF lip balms offer protection against both types of damage.

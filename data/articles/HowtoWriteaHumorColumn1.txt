 Funny things happen all of the time, but your memory might not retain all of the humorous elements that are worthy of writing about. Keeping a journal with you to instantly record anything that you think might make good fodder for your humor column down the line, or ideas that might come out you out of the blue. Re-reading the journal later on might reveal insights that are humorous enough to inspire a column; at worst, you will be left with a journal full of ideas that will not make it to print., Your own life can be a great source of inspiration for a humor column, provided that you are able to laugh at yourself. The benefit of writing autobiographically is that you don’t have to worry about offending anyone – you are simply telling your story in a humorous way, and giving readers permission to laugh at your blunders or comedic misfortune. Try writing first person accounts of funny things that happen to you, then re-read them at a later date. Putting some distance between reading the column and experiencing the event itself will allow you to see if the story is objectively funny, or a “you had to be there” kind of story., When looking for inspiration for your humor column, look to other humor writers for inspiration. Note what they write about, how they structure their articles, and what elements make the writing funny. Try to pick up on tricks that the writer might be using to keep their readers laughing.

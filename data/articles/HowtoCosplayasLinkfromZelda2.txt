 Another signature aspect of Link’s appearance is his Hylian shield. Search google images for Link’s shield and print a copy for you to reference. Use a foam board and cut out the outline of the shield.Draw a mock up onto the board before cutting.
Color in the shield’s design with paint and markers.
For extra detail, cut out all the details of the shield with an x-acto knife from a foam board. Then paint the details and use a hot glue gun to position them onto the shield.
 Most Link costumes also have some sort of sword. They are usually kept in a holder attached to your back. You can fashion your own sword by using scrap parts of a foam board. The difficult part is making a realistic handle.


Make sure the handle is blue if you choose to construct your own sword.You can also purchase a cheap plastic sword and paint the handle blue.
 Link doesn’t just carry around a sword and shield. You can get creative with which Link accessories you want to carry. You can use an ocarina for a nice touch that doesn’t require you to build anything. You could also carry a dagger on your waist side.


Link also carries a crossbow and arrows with him in the game. Consider this as an option.
Don’t carry real weapons. It’s easy to get carried away while in costume.

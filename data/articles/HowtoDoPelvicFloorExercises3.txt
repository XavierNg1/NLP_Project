 Kegels are not the only way to strengthen your pelvic floor. There are numerous exercises you can do, and a great one is bridges. Start by laying on your back with your knees bent, keeping your feet about a fist distance apart. Then flex your lower abdominal muscles and lift your hips off the ground. Stop when there is a straight line from your knees to your shoulders. Hold for 3 seconds and slowly return your hips to the ground.Repeat 3 times. Work toward doing 3 sets of 10. Once you can do 3 sets, start increasing repetitions to 10 per set.
Try not to turn your head while your hips are lifted, as this can strain your neck.
 Jumping jacks are another great way to strengthen your pelvic floor. Start out with your legs together and your arms down. Then tighten your pelvic floor as you jump, moving your legs apart and bringing your arms up above your head. Relax your pelvic floor as you jump your legs back together and bring your arms down.Repeat for 30 to 60 seconds.
 Position yourself against a wall, with your feet about hip-width apart. Take a deep breath and tighten your pelvic floor. Then slide your back down the wall, lowering into a squat (like you're sitting in a chair). Hold this for 10 seconds, then stand back up.Do 10 reps.
 Start lying on your back, with your knees bent and your feet at knee level. Strength your arms straight up toward the ceiling. Take a deep breath, tighten your pelvic floor muscles, and extend your left arm and left leg in opposite directions. Release back to the position your started in, and repeat on the right side.Do 10 reps on each side.
 Make it a habit to exercise your pelvic floor. It can take up to 12 weeks of regular practice in order for you to start seeing results. You will see more significant results if you continue to increase the intensity of these exercises each week.

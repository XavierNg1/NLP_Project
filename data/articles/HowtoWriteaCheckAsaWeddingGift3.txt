 Rather than writing a check for a generic amount of money—$15, $25, $50—you can give the couple a more specific amount. This will show that you’ve put thought into the gift, and that you’re not simply writing them a check out of convenience.


For example, if you have gone out to dinner with the couple in the past, give them enough money to have dinner again at your favorite restaurant. Make it clear that the money is for this purpose in your note in the card.
 Don’t put a strain on your budget just to make a show of generosity to the couple getting married. Decide how much you can afford to give, think about how much the couple might like to receive (for example, are they planning to make a down payment on a house in the near future?), and make your decision from there.When considering how much to give, take your relationship with the couple into account. If you’re intimate friends or a close family member, it would be appropriate to give a larger sum than if you’re only distant acquaintances.
 Of course, you should take your own budget into account, or evaluate how much you would have spent on a tangible gift. But if you’re utterly at a loss when deciding how much money to make the check out for, consider the guidelines proposed by wedding-etiquette experts.If you’re a co-worker or distant family friend or relative: $50–75.
If you’re a relative or friend: $75–100.
If you’re a close relative or a close friend: $100–150.

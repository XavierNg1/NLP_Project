 For most anthology citations, you should cite the individual work that appears within the anthology instead of the entire anthology. Follow the borrowed information with a parenthetical citation that includes the last name of the work's author and the anthology page number where the information appears.Typical Form: (ALastName PageNumber)

Example: (Smith 194);
, If the information used comes from the editor's notes, introduction, or other text created solely by the editor, you should use the name of the anthology's editor as the author's name. Include the page number, as well.



Typical Form: (ELastName PageNumber)

Example: (Doe 2)

, If you used information directly from one work within a larger anthology, cite the individual work instead of citing the full anthology.Typical Form: ALastName, AFirstName. "Title of Work." Title of Anthology. Ed. EFirstName ELastName. City of Publication: Publisher, Year. Page range of entry. Publication medium.

Example: Smith, Susan. “Interesting Story.” A Collection of Interesting Stories. Ed. John Doe. New York: Great Publishing Company, 2015. 194-198. Print.
 When you use information provided by the editor of an anthology, you'll need to cite the entire anthology.


Note that you'll also need to identify the name as that of the editor by including the abbreviation “ed.”

Typical Form: ELastName, EFirstName, ed. Title of Anthology. City of Publication: Publisher, Year. Publication medium.

Example: Doe, John, ed. A Collection of Interesting Stories. New York: Great Publishing Company, 2015. Print.
 If you used information from multiple works within one anthology, you can cross-reference that anthology by including separate entries for the whole book and each cited work.


Include one entry for the entire anthology, then a separate entry for each individual work included in that anthology. Each citation for individual works should reference the full anthology but does not need to include the full publication information.
The entry for the full anthology should follow the standard citation format used for whole anthologies:

ELastName, EFirstName, ed. Title of Anthology. City of Publication: Publisher, Year. Publication medium.


The entry for each individual work will use abbreviated publication information for the anthology:

ALastName, AFirstName. "Title of Work." Ed. ELastName PageRange.



Example:

Doe, John, ed. A Collection of Interesting Stories. New York: Great Publishing Company, 2015. Print.
Johnson, Leslie. "Fascinating Tale." Doe 321-330.
Smith, Susan. “Interesting Story.” Doe 194-198.

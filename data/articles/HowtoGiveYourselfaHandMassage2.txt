 As you do all these techniques, breathe in through your nose while expanding your diaphragm (belly-breathing), and out through the mouth. Breathing is as important as the massage itself, and it may be wise to take ten of these deep breaths prior to and after the massage., Start by holding out one of your hands, keeping your fingers straight. Then, wrap your opposite hand's fingers around the back of your hand with your fingers facing straight up. Your thumb should be laying on your palm, and pointing towards you.
 This technique is most effective at massaging the pads of your palms just under your fingers and thumb, and the entire edge of your hand. Compress your palm with your thumb, using short, caterpillar-like movements, going up and down, and working your way from the inside to the outside of your palm.








Apply the amount of pressure you are comfortable with. Start off using light pressure, and then work your way towards a deeper massage.
This will help you find tender, sore, or tight spots.
 They will be long, like a continuation of the fingers through the palm. Pinch the base of the hand, in between the bones, and glide upwards. Continue using short strokes when rubbing.
 When you reach the finger, continue to pinch up the finger with a firm pressure. Inch your thumb up and down each finger, starting at the balls, and working your way up slowly to the tip of your finger.









Squeeze along the sides of your fingers, too. Repeat this for every finger.

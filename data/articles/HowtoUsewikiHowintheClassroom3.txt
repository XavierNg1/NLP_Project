 Providing them with graphic organizers may be helpful here. This is a good time for students to start separating information which might best be communicated under the wikiHow "Steps" category from information which belongs in the "Tips" and "Warnings" sections.
 Most teachers don't have students compose directly on the wikiHow page at first. There are a couple of reasons for this: 1) this is a valuable opportunity to promote writing and editing skills, and 2) once the wikiHow article is posted, anyone can edit it before you have a chance to evaluate it.
 Students should write their instructions in block paragraph format; the reason for this will become evident in the next section. This draft form of the article must be carefully proofread before students are ready to post on the wikiHow site.

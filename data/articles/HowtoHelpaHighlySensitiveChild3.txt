 Kids who are highly sensitive are often more compassionate towards others and often have lots of empathy. They are also usually quite creative and are intuitive to the needs of others.

Additionally, highly sensitive kids tend to fall in love deeply, are responsible, gentle, and usually make great peacekeepers. Focusing on your child’s gifts, rather than their challenges, can help you appreciate and better deal with them., Highly sensitive children can’t help what they feel, just like you can’t help the way you feel. They just may feel things more deeply than you and react differently. Instead of attempting to change their sensitivities, a more effective approach is to help them learn coping techniques for times when they are upset., Does your highly sensitive child find certain clothing materials unbearable to wear? Are loud noises too much for them to take? This is likely due to having nervous systems that are highly reactive and respond quicker and more intensely to certain stimulation.

Know that your child’s behavior is due to a physical condition in addition to an emotional one. Sometimes, getting a better understanding of their condition may help you realize they aren’t just being “dramatic.”

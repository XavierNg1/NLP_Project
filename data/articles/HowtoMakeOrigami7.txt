 This is one of the most common origami designs and has many different variations.
 This project is modeled after a two-horned kabuto helmet, which has two horns and is intended to represent the mythical entity of the wearer’s choice.
 While this design is made with white paper, you can use brown, Army green or camouflage origami paper for a more decorative finished piece.
 A Shuriken star, or Ninja star, can be made from regular 8-1/2” x 11” paper or construction paper. Place the finished star, or multiple finished stars, in your hand and throw them like a Frisbee.

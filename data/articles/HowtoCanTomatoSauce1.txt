 You will need about three quart-size (liter-size) glass canning jars, complete with a lid that has a rubber seal. Two-piece lids are ideal. Each one must be free of chips and cracks.;
, The jars need to be cleaned and sterilized before they are safe to use. Fill your sink with hot water and mild dish detergent. Scrub the jars clean and rinse them with hot water.
 After washing the jars and lids, you should sterilize them in boiling water. Fill a large sauce pot with water and heat it to boiling. Use canning tongs to dip the jars and lids into the water. Allow them to soak for 15 minutes before pulling them out with the tongs.
 If not, wash the jars using a normal wash cycle. Make sure that the jars go through a full rinse cycle to rid them of any excess soap.
 You can let them air dry by placing them upside-down in a drying rack or you can dry them out manually with a clean, dry dish towel.

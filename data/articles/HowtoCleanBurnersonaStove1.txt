 Before cleaning, remove the burners from your gas or electric stove top. Be sure that the stove is off and that the elements are completely cooled down before taking off the burner grates or coils. Place them aside on a counter top to be cleaned.Most burners come off easily, but others may require a gentle twist or squeeze to be removed. If you encounter difficulty, refer to your appliance manual for detailed instructions.;
, Add a few drops of dish washing liquid to a small bowl of warm water and agitate the mixture to produce soap suds. Dip a clean cloth or rag into the liquid, wring it out, and wipe down each coil to remove stains or debris. Re-wet and wring out the cloth for each burner.With electric burner coils, avoid getting the electrical connection wet and do not submerge them in water.
 Wet a clean cloth with plain water and wipe down the burner coils or grates once again. Be sure to remove any soapy residue that may be left behind. Lay the burners on a clean dish towel to dry.For best results, let the burners dry for several hours before putting them back on the stove.

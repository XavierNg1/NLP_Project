 The three guys are named Groose, Cawlin, and Stritch. Interact with them.
 Groose (the one with the pompadour) will then act as if your loftwing is gone forever, teasing you about him. He will then say he might have gotten lost, as in the start of the cutscene he is talking about them trapping him in a pen., Fledge (the one with the rosy cheeks and gray hair) will just say "..." so ignore him... Until you talk to Pipit, he will say that Groose was planning on hiding your loftwing in a waterfall.,, Practice to venture on., There will be two new enemies: the Keese, whichÂ take two hits to kill, and the green chuchu, which take one hit to kill., When you kill the first green chuchu, turn and look (press C on the Wii remote) right, and there will be a ledge. Jump onto the ledge, open the chest, get 20 rupees, and jump down., Don't forget that to the right of the exit, there are rupees., Run down the hill, and in the pen with wood across it, there your loftwing is.,

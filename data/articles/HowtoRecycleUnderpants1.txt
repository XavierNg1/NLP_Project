 This recycling method is probably as old as underpants themselves. When they're really no good for wearing anymore, simply pile them up in a rag bag (clean them first) and bring them out when a rag is needed for washing the floor, the car or anything else; for buffing when polishing and to wipe those paint brushes on when painting. They can be rewashed or tossed when they're just too stained or threadbare.;

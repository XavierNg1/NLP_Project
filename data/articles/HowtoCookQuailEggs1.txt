 Place the quail eggs in a small saucepan. Add enough cold water to cover the eggs by 1 inch (2.5 cm).


Handle the eggs gently to prevent them from cracking. The eggs should remain in a single layer with some space between them; do not crowd or stack them.
While not strictly necessary, consider adding 1 tsp (5 ml) salt and 1 tsp (5 ml) white vinegar to the water. Doing so can help separate the egg from its shell, making the eggs easier to peel later.;
, Place the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat. Allow the water to reach a steady boil.
 As soon as the water reaches a boil, turn off the heat and cover the saucepan. Cook the eggs for an additional 5 minutes in the hot water.Leave the saucepan on the burner while the eggs finish boiling. The residual heat from the burner will help cook the eggs more thoroughly. Leaving the heat on could overcook the eggs, however.
 Use a slotted spoon to transfer the eggs into a bowl of ice water. Cool the eggs for 3 to 4 minutes.


Dunking the eggs in ice water stops the cooking process. It also makes the eggs easier to peel.
If you don't have an ice bath, rinse each egg under cold, running water until the shells feel cool to the touch.
 Peel off the shell and enjoy the hard boiled quail eggs as desired.


To peel the eggs, lightly tap the shell on a hard surface to break it. Lift away the shell at its cracks.
You can serve the eggs plain with a little salt or celery salt for flavor. Alternatively, you can use hard boiled quail eggs in other recipes, like tea marbled eggs, pickled eggs, and kwek kwek.

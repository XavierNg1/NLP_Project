 Unclasp the two ends of your necklace. Hold a drinking straw vertically, and drop the smaller end of your necklace clasp down through the straw. When the necklace comes out through the bottom of the straw, reconnect the two ends of your necklace.This method may work best with thinner necklaces, and necklaces that don’t have an attached and immovable pendant in the center of the chain. The pendant will not be able to fit through the straw.
If your necklace has an immovable pendant, consider cutting the straw in half, threading one chain on the side of the pendant through the straw., Rather than keeping all of your necklaces in a jewelry box, consider using a necklace tree (the “tree’s” branches allow necklaces to hang) or create your own necklace hanger.You can use pins and a bulletin board to make a fun, unique jewelry hanger.


Keep in mind, heavy necklaces might not hang very securely on the pins.
 Insert your necklace into a small, snap closure bag (the kind buttons come in with new clothes) and leave the clasp closure outside of the bag.Snap as much of the small baggie as you can shut, except for the area where the clasp is hanging out.


The small baggie will keep the necklace contained without jumbling the chain together.

 You can find it at http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/. Resource Hacker allows you to open and view DLL files as text files.
 It resembles an orange "RH" icon., This is in the top-left corner of the Resource Hacker window., It's near the top of the drop-down menu., In most cases, the DLL files you'll want to edit will be located in the "System32" folder.

You can navigate through the folders by first selecting the "This PC" folder from the left-hand pane, then double-clicking your hard drive's icon.
 This will select it., Doing so will open the DLL file in question. You'll see its folders appear in the left-hand pane of Resource Hacker, meaning you're ready to proceed with editing your DLL file., These appear in the left side of the Resource Hacker window.

A folder entitled "PNG", "Bitmap", or "Icon"/"Icon group" stores the code for system images.
 Binary tags appear in the DLL file's folders; clicking one will display its contents in Resource Hacker's main window.

Binary tags are typically formatted as "# : #" (for example, "1 : 1033" or "123 : 1033").
 This process will vary depending on your DLL file and the type of content in it.

For example, opening a folder entitled "Icon Group" will allow you to change the appearance of a system icon by selecting a different icon with which to replace the original one.
Be extremely careful when editing DLL text, as a single misplaced letter can cause a DLL file to stop working.
 It's the green triangle above the main Resource Hacker window., This option is the green floppy disk icon without "AS" written on it. Doing so will save your modified DLL file.

If you wish to change the DLL file's name, you'll click the "AS" version instead.
 This will replace the old DLL file with your newly updated one.

If you click the "Save As" option, you'll need to type in a new name and select a save location.

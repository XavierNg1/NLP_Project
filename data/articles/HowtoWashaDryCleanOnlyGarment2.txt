 Reserve gentle machine washing for items with stiffer fabric that won't get misshapen if agitated. Cottons, linens, and durable polyesters can usually withstand machine washing.
 The water should be cold, not warm or hot. Use a mild detergent to wash the clothing.


Wash your dry-clean-only items on the gentle cycle.
 Lay them flat or hang them to dry.

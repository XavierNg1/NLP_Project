 Spirea will benefit from a good mulch in the springtime. To do this, spread a layer of compost or well-rotted manure about two inches thick across the area of ground covered by the bush’s branches.


This will help retain moisture in the soil over the hotter months, keep the weeds down and, later, protect the roots from the cold as the cooler weather draws in.
 Over the summer your Spirea will be grateful for some water when the weather is particularly hot or dry. Keep in mind that established plants won’t need much watering most of the time apart from these hot months.
 Spirea tend not to have a lot of problems but can occasionally be troubled by aphid infestation. Look out for curled leaves as a sign that aphids are taking over.


A blast of water from the garden hose usually works to dislodge aphids. You can also use a commercial aphid spray.
 Look for blackened stem tips that curl away from the plant; this is a sign of fire blight. Try to aggressively prune away the affected areas and then burn the trimmings.

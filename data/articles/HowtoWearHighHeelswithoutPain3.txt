 Try to step like you would in any other flat shoe, heel to toe. It can take some getting used to to maintain balance on a thinner heel. Take small steps and look at yourself walk in a mirror if you can.


It’s a good idea to practice walking around your house in heels to get used to their feel and the right way to walk.
 Keep your abs engaged, your shoulders back, and your head up. Note that your posture in heels will require more curves in your body, with your back slightly arched and your chest and pelvis pushed forward. Get used to walking with this new, slightly more forward center of gravity., Hold onto a railing or wall when you can to lend support and prevent catching a heel or rolling an ankle.


Wear a wider heel for outdoor surfaces, to prevent them from sticking into dirt or grass or causing you to slip or injure an ankle.
 Take a break from your heels every now and then while you’re wearing them. Try slipping off your heels while you’re sitting down, or even elevating or massaging your feet to bring circulation to them.Gently rotate your ankles and spread your toes apart under the table when you can to provide relief and prevent injury., Slip on no-show socks that will hide under your heels, or wear tights or stockings to make heels more comfortable if they tend to rub against your feet, especially after sweating a little.
 Limit the period of time you wear heels to a minimum, as best you can. Instead of wearing heels through the whole day, try wearing a flat during work and save the heels for going out at night.

 Legally changing your name is a serious decision, so make sure to pick a name that you like enough to keep. Before you commit to any particular name, consider trying it on for size. Use in public, ask your loved ones, and try to imagine yourself walking through life with this particular name.
 Try the name on, and see how it fits. The stranger can be your Starbucks barista or someone you meet in a barâ€•anyone who doesn't know you by your birth name. Try this: when you leave the house today, set yourself the goal of introducing yourself as to at least one person.


Make sure that you aren't with anyone who knows you by your birth name. At least explain what you're doing beforehand. If you bring along a friend who knows that you're choosing a new name, you may feel much more comfortable introducing yourself.
Be mindful when introducing yourself to friends of friends, or to people who you might encounter in the course of "everyday life". If too many people know you by too many names, you may eventually find yourself at the center of a confusing or embarrassing situation.
 Simply say, "Can you see me as a Theodore?" Tell them that you want an honest, objective opinion, unclouded by their knowledge of your current name. Don't feel pressured to act on their opinions, although you may find this process a useful way to guide your decision.
 Write your potential new name out on a piece of paper, and see how it looks. Ask yourself whether it feels "right" to spell your name this way. Try writing it along with your last name; try scrawling out a signature. Read it aloud to yourself.


If you're deciding between a few possible names, try writing all of them out on the same page. See which names leap out at you. Odds are, you'll be most drawn to one or two choices. It may be easier to compare your options when they're laid out before you.

 If the droppings are in an accessible place, wet them with warm water before you begin cleaning. Pour the water directly over the spot, or soak a washcloth and use it to cover the spot. The warmth and moisture of the water will begin softening the stain, loosening its hold on hard, porous surfaces., Give the warm water ample time to begin softening the stain. Bird droppings dry in a thick paste, and it may be much harder to clean them away if they’re still partially dry. Make sure you’ve wet the entire spot. Once the water has softened the droppings, they will begin to look fresh again.
 Take a garden hose and hold it a few feet away from the spot. Turn it on at full flow and aim it directly at the bird droppings. The constant stream of water should finish the job that wetting the spot started. Go over the stain it’s completely gone.If your hose comes with a head that allows you to adjust the stream, set it to the high-pressure, single stream flow to blast away bird messes.
If your hose doesn't have an adjustable head, you can place your thumb halfway over the nozzle to partially block the water flow and produce a higher pressure stream manually.
 If traces of the droppings remain after you’ve washed the spot with a hose, take a small, stiff-bristled scrubbing brush (a household broom will also work) and scour the area, re-wetting as needed. The bristles will dig into the crevices in the brick, concrete or roofing tile and and scrape away the remaining bird poop.


Be sure to clean the brush off after use; bird feces is filled with bacteria.

 Add 11 ounces (312 g) of white chocolate chips, 3 ounces (85 g) of coconut oil, and a pinch of salt to a large microwave-safe bowl. You don’t need to mix the ingredients together because they won’t really blend until they’re heated.You can substitute a bar of finely chopped white chocolate for the chips if you prefer.
 Place the bowl with the ingredients in the microwave and heat on medium power for 30 seconds. Stir afterward, and if the white chocolate has melted, repeat the process until it is completely smooth.You may need to repeat the process as many as 4 times to fully melt the chocolate.
Make sure to stir the sauce together well after the chocolate is melted to ensure that all of the ingredients are blended.
 After the chocolate has melted and the sauce is blended, let the mixture cool for 5 to 10 minutes or until it returns to room temperature. When it’s cool enough to handle, transfer it to an airtight jar.You can store the shell sauce at room temperature for 3 to 4 months or in the fridge for about 6 months. If you refrigerate it, reheat it for 30 seconds in the microwave before using, though, because it will harden at lower temperatures.
 When you’re ready to use the white chocolate shell sauce, use a spoon to drizzle it over a bowl of ice cream. Wait about 30 seconds for shell to harden before eating.You can also use the white chocolate shell sauce to coat homemade popsicles.

, Craigslist allows you to post based on your location. Picking the country, city and area closest to you will make for an easier process when shipping or arranging a pick up of your goods.
, Note: You are not allowed to post items for sale that have been recalled or prohibited.
 (The "by owner" option is used in this example).



Alternatively, you can visit the Craigslist forums and follow the onscreen instructions at the top right to request a new Craigslist area.
 The title for the car ad must always start with the year in 4 digits, (eg 2005, not 05), followed by the make name (eg Ford) and the model (eg Festiva).


Title Example: 2007 Toyota Prius
Title Example: 2010 Chevrolet Impala

, The price is must be entered in the field provided as well as the location, (town or city), where the vehicle is located. Include a phone number and an email so you can be contacted by interested people.


Fill in each field on the page, especially these:

status of the title
the odometer
the transmission type
drive type
fuel
how many cylinders (typically 4, 6 or 8 )


If there is a field you do not know how to fill out, go find the answer. Skipping that information will cause people to skip your ad because they will think it is a scam ad. Include all details that you want other users to know when reading your ad and considering purchasing your car.
 Ads with no pictures are often scams. Also ads with just a few pics are also often scams. Provide at least one shot of each side of the car (front, left, right and rear, as well as shots that show the clean interior of each section of the car. And if the interior isn't clean, clean it before taking the pictures).
 Before posting your ad, you will have the chance to preview how it will appear to potential buyers. If you want to change something and continue editing your ad, select the “Edit” button. Otherwise, click the “Continue” button to continue the process and post your ad.
 Click the “Accept the terms of use” button to agree to the terms and continue posting your ad.

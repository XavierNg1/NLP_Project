 Fill the cocktail shaker about 3/4 of the way full with ice.Add all your ingredients to the cocktail shaker. Vigorously shake the shaker until the ingredients are mixed throughout.Once you see condensation forming on the outside of the shaker, your drinks are ready to serve.
 Remove the cap of the shaker but not the strainer. Strain the mixture into six martini glasses and serve.

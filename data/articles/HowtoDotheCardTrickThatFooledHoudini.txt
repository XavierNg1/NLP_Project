 It's best if you borrow one from a friend, that way the deck will seem more innocent. Shuffle the cards to show that they are in random order.;
, When you first get the deck, pretend to be squaring up the deck but really in the meantime, take three cards from the deck and hide them, as one, in your hand. If you kind of curl your fingers around the cards, no one will notice them.
 It doesn't matter which one they choose. When they've seen their card, have them place the card on top of the deck.
 Really you are placing the three cards you had hidden in your hand on top of the deck. Now, the chosen card should be the fourth card in the deck.
 Of course, you are only taking one of the miscellaneous cards that are on top of it. Without showing the face of the card, put it somewhere towards the middle of the deck, claiming to be losing their card.
 If you lift them all as one, it will look like you are only turning over the selected card. The card, which was just placed in the middle of the deck, has now returned to the top!

, Replace the three cards, as one, back on top of the deck. Take the top card (one of the miscellaneous ones) and place it in the middle of the deck, claiming to be losing the card. You could even shuffle the cards and claim to be mixing up the order, just make sure that the top three cards stay on top. Turn over the top two cards to reveal - once again - that the card has returned to the top.
 Turn over the top two cards, as one, turn them over again, take the top card, and return it to the middle of the deck. This time, to prove that the card really has "returned" to the top, you could have the spectator turn over the top card.

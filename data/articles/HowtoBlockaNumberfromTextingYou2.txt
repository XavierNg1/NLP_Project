 Look to the bottom of your phone, and locate Messaging. Tap on it.
 Once you're in Messaging, tap on the menu button. It's usually fairly invisible, and located to the lower left side of your device. It'll slightly light up if you tap on it. After tapping on it, you'll see various menu options.
 You're now in the Settings category of your Messaging app. Scroll down until you reach Register Number As Spam. That's the option that will allow you to no longer be notified when your unwanted contact sends you a text.
 Look to the upper right side of your screen, and tap on the Plus sign to add unwanted numbers.


If you've never added a contact as spam, the screen will be mostly black and say No Numbers Blocked.
 You have the option of either manually typing a number you wish to mark as Spam, or you can retrieve it from your contacts if you've previously registered it in your phone.
 Once you've selected the contacts to be marked as spam, tap on Save (upper right corner). You will now no longer receive texts from that number or contact.


You can remove a number from spam anytime by deleting the contact or number from that list.

 The closest one is at Fuchsia City, but you can buy them anywhere. While you could catch Articuno, theoretically, with any ball, the Ultra Ball has the highest chance of success.;
, Articuno is at level 50, and it will put up a good fight when it comes across you. Be prepared to chip away at its health with a few strong Pokemon.While you don't want to kill it before capture, a Fire and an Electric Pokémon will make powerful additions to your team here. Make sure you also have a strong, basic Pokemon, like a Normal type, to fight as well.
 Some of the of the best moves to have are Thunder Wave, Hypnosis, and/or Sleep Powder. These effects will greatly increase your ability to capture Articuno, as they up the percentages of a successful ball throw., You'll be making a decent sized trip to get to Articuno, and you don't want to be left with weak Pokémon when the fight begins. Bring Revives, TM Boosts, and Potions to make sure your team is in top shape when you arrive, or simply use Repels to avoid fighting wild Pokemon.
 You'll need both of them to reach Articuno, so don't attempt it until your have 1-2 Pokémon with the moves in your party.

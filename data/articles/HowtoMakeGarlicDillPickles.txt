 (1.5kg) of pickling cucumbers. Make sure not to buy waxed cucumbers. Try to find cucumbers of less than 4 inches (10cm) at a farmer's market or natural food store.;
, If you do not want whole pickles, cut them in disks horizontally or in spears vertically. Wash them well before cutting.
 This is an important step that reduces the risk of contamination by bacteria. This garlic pickle recipe makes 4 pint jars of pickles.


Fill your canning pot with warm water. Place the jars and lids inside the pot and bring them to a boil. Boil them for at least 10 minutes.
At sea level you should boil them for 10 minutes. For every 1,000 feet (305m) above sea level, boil for 1 more minute.
 Place 2 cups (473ml) of white or apple cider vinegar, 2 cups (473ml) of water and 2 tbsp. (36g) of pickling salt in a saucepan.
 Remove from heat quickly. Letting the brine boil for too long will change the composition and make it unsuitable for pickling.
 The amount of garlic should be adjusted to your taste.
 Add 1/4 tsp. (1.5g) of red pepper flakes and 1/2 tsp. (1.5g) of whole black peppercorns to each jar.
, Pour the brine over the pickles in each jar. Fill it up to within 1/4 inch (0.6cm) of the top of the jar.


Tap the jars with a wooden spoon. This will remove air bubbles.
 Place the rims on the top and screw on the lids.
 Set a timer so you don't boil them too long. The pickles can lose their crunch if they remain longer.
 Place them on the counter until they cool. Place them in your pantry until you are ready to serve them.

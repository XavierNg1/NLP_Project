 This recipe makes 24 tortillas. Here are the ingredients you'll need to make tasty corn tortillas:


2 cups masa harina (preferably Maseca brand)
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

, Make sure salt is evenly distributed in the masa.
, The dough should have the consistency of Play-Doh: springy and firm but also slightly dry.


Add more water by tablespoons if the dough is too dry; add more masa if the dough is too wet.
 Remember that corn tortillas are traditionally smaller than flour tortillas.


Use a tortilla press lined with plastic wrap for even, more uniform-looking tortillas.






If you don't have a tortilla press, use a rolling pin for more artisanal tortillas.
 If the dough crumbles, it is too dry — add more water. If the dough sticks to the plastic on the press, or to the rolling pin, it is too wet — add more masa.


This will be your final chance to get the consistency right before cooking.
 The tortillas won't take long to cook, so you may want to have them all pressed before you begin cooking. If you're working with a tortilla press, you should have enough time to press tortillas while you cook.
 Cast iron pans distribute heat evenly and quickly, so they are best for cooking tortillas, but any non-stick pan will do the job in a pinch.
 Cook 1-2 minutes on one side, or until slightly charred and edges begin to curl. Flip onto opposite side and cook for 15 more seconds. Remove from heat.


If using a cast-iron pan, it's okay to cook more than one tortilla at a time.
 Keep the tortillas warm by wrapping them in a clean kitchen towel if serving immediately.

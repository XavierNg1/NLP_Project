 If you have a top-loading washing machine, lift up the lid as if you were going to start a new load of laundry. The fabric-softener dispenser is usually located right under the lid, in one of the corners.The fabric softener dispenser is usually located next to the detergent dispenser and the bleach dispenser, depending on the structure of your washing machine.


If you’re struggling to find the dispenser’s location, check your washing machine’s manual. It should have a layout showing the location of all parts of the machine.;
, If you have a front-loading washing machine, you’ll need to look on top of the machine to access the softener dispenser. Most front-loading machines have a drawer or slot for fabric softener under a lid on top of the machine, next to the drawers for laundry detergent and bleach.If you can’t find the fabric softener dispenser there, it may be located just inside of the main door.


As with a top-loading machine, if you can’t find the fabric softener dispenser, check the washing machine manual for a display showing the location of the dispenser.
 Some washing machines have removable fabric softener dispensers, while others feature a non-removable dispenser.If yours is removable, reach in and gently pull the dispenser out of the washing machine. This will make the dispenser easier to clean. Since it may be clogged, the fabric softener dispenser will likely be gunky and covered with soap and fabric softener.


If your washing machine features a non-removable dispenser, it can still be cleaned while lodged within the laundry machine.

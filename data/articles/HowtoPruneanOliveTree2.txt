 In this phase, when the olive tree is about 4 years old, pruning is done in order to increase olive production.


With pruning shears, cut off any upper branches that are more than three years old in order to leave space for younger branches to grow, as they tend to be more productive.
 There is no restriction to the number of dry shoots that you can prune, but keep in mind that the less dry shoots you have, the more olives that will grow.


Make small, angular cuts, but only in the dry sections so that you don't damage the rest of the tree.
It is important to remove dry shoots from the branches; once you do this, it will only take a few days for you to see new, green shoots starting to grow.
You can also remove one or various whole branches that are completely dry. You will be able to tell that they are dry because they have dead-looking, coffee-colored leaves.
 You should remove several upper branches in order to establish this uniformity.


Prune upper branches until you see that sunlight gets to the majority of the tree.
Be careful to leave some shade for the trunk and a few main branches in order to maximize your productive season and keep your tree from aging too quickly.

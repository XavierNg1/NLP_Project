 Hold the lime under a stream of cool water and rub gently. Pat dry with a towel.
 A zester is a kitchen tool with several tiny blades or sharp holes, which creates long, curling ribbons of lime zest, perfect for garnishing. Alternatively, these strips can then be chopped finely for use in cooking.

Some refer to this tool as a "traditional zester" and call microplanes "microplane zesters."

, If you are creating a garnish for a cocktail or dish, remove part of the white pith along with the colored zest in order to keep the curl intact.If you are using the zest for cooking, try to only remove thin strips of the colored zest.
 Once the strips have been removed and the white pith beneath is exposed, rotate to an untouched section of the lime. Continue to pull the zester over the lime until you have the amount of zest you need for your recipe.


The thickness of lime skin varies more than most citrus fruit, so it is difficult to predict how much zest is produced by one lime. If the recipe calls for "zest from one lime" without specifying the variety of lime, use approximately two tsp (10 mL) of zest.
 If you are using the zest as a decorative garnish, skip this step. If you are using them in a recipe, use a sharp knife to cut the zest into fine pieces.

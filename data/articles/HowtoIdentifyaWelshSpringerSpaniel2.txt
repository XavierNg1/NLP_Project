 The Welsh springer spaniel's head is well proportioned to its body. It is not overly wide but also not skinny. This well-proportioned nature extends to the muzzle, which should not be overly long but should not be stubby.The dog's muzzle should be the same length, but never longer than, the length of the skull.
 The Welsh springer spaniel face and muzzle are well defined below the eyes. This means that they are well-chiseled and tight-skinned on their faces.Above the eyes the dog's skin is a little looser. This can be seen in the dog's eyebrow region, which gives it a nice facial expression.
Most often the Welsh springer spaniel has brown eyes.
 The Welsh springer spaniel's neck is relatively long for its size. However, the neck is only slightly curved and connects into the shoulders cleanly.It should have skin on the neck that is clean and not droopy but not overly tight.

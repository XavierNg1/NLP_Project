 Find something that you like. You might want a leather handgrip, or metal ridges, or axe-style blades on either side of the lightsaber blade (check out Darth Malgus' lightsaber).
 Darth Sidious and Mace Windu had hilts finished in electrum (a gold-silver alloy). Kylo Ren has a very weathered, utilitarian look to his hilt. Most hilts, however, appear to be somewhere in between, with a matte or metallic finish to them.
 This is the mechanism that joins the sabers together to form a staff. It is usually a simple twist to lock mechanism, but some have a fibre cable that allows you to hold one hilt and use the other as a flail.
 This is especially true if you're making your own saber. The possibilities for customisation are endless. For example, Pong Krell, a general in the Clone Wars, had saberstaffs (Yes, saberstaffs, plural. The guy had four arms.) with handles that folded in half, to make them easier to carry.

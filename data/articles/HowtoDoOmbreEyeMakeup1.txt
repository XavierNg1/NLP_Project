 It is important to prime your eyes to prevent creasing. You can use the makeup primer of your choice, or if you don’t have primer, you can cover your eyelids with concealer and powder. Use a small amount of concealer to cover your eyelid and then cover it in a nude powder. Or, you can use a nude cream eye shadow.








The primer should blend in with your natural skin tone.;
, Line the base of the top of your eyelashes with a thin line of black eyeliner. Use the same eyeliner to create a thin line under the lashline. The eyeliner should only extend 1







, Choose any color of eye shadow to use as a base color. For example, you can choose hot pink or deep purple. Cover your eyelid, crease, and under your bottom lashes. Then, use the same color and extend it from the corners of your eyes to the tip of your eyebrows.
 Pick a color that is a lighter shade of your base color, or a different color that matches well with the base color. For example, if you have dark purple as the base color, you can use lavender as the second shade. Or, you can use a smoky rose color. 








This look will turn out better if you don’t use a dramatically different color because it will stand out too much from the base color.
 Take a small blending brush and apply the second color around the tops of your lashes. Apply this color around your eyes as if it were a thick eyeliner. Then, blend the second shade around the tops of your eyelashes. There should not be a stark difference between the two colors when you are finished blending. 







, Finish the look by coating your eyelashes in mascara. Use two coats of volumizing, extending, or lash-defining mascara. Black is the best choice for this look, but you can also use brown.

 An excessive amount of soy sauce can overpower the taste of Japanese cuisine and can be considered bad table manners if you waste soy sauce by using more than you end up eating.


Pour soy sauce into a small serving dish provided with your meal, then dip small pieces of food or small amounts of rice into the sauce for flavoring.
 Wasabi can largely overpower the flavor of most dishes if used in excess, and can also offend sushi chefs if added liberally to a piece of sushi after it has already been prepared.


Request that your sushi be made without wasabi if you do not like its taste. This will prevent the sushi chef from being offended if you do not eat the sushi.

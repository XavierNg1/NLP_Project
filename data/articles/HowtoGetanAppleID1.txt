 Creating an Apple ID is free.;
, To create an Apple ID, you will need to enter a valid email address. This will be used as a contact email, and will also become your Apple ID. When you log into a service that requires Apple ID, you will enter this email address and the password that you create.
 Your Apple ID will have your store transactions on it, as well as lots of information about the Apple devices that you use. Make sure that your password is secure, and include numbers and symbols to make it stronger.
 These will be used in case you forget your password and need to request a new one. Apple will use this information to verify your identity before sending you a new password.
 Apple needs this information for any purchases that you may make with this Apple ID. Your mailing address lets them know where people are using their products.
 Apple automatically opts you in to receive newsletters and product updates through the email that you provide. If you’d rather not receive these, uncheck the boxes.
 Type in the characters that appear in the picture. If you can’t read them, click the “Try a different image” button to get a new one, or the “Vision Impaired” button to have it read out-loud to you.
 Before you can create your ID, you need to indicate that you have read the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you have and you agree to them, check the box. Click the Create Apple ID button. You will receive an email asking you to confirm that you created the Apple ID.


When creating an Apple ID through the website, you will not need to enter any billing information. Once you log into iTunes with it, however, you will be asked to enter a credit card and billing address.

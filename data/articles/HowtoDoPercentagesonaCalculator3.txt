 A common calculation involving percentages is to find some percent “of” another number. For example, if you are in a restaurant you may want to tip 15% “of” your total bill. When working with percentages, the word “of” carries the same meaning as “times” or “multiply.” Therefore, 15% “of” 100, for example, means the same as 15% x 100.
 To calculate the percentage of the whole number, you need to first turn the percentage into a decimal as already described. Then simply multiply.


For example, completing the problem of finding 15% of 100, rewrite the 15% as 0.15. Then just multiply 0.15 x 100, to get the solution of 15.
 When you set out to find a percentage of a whole number, your result will be a number and not a percentage. You may begin with a percentage symbol, but when you convert that percentage to a decimal to conduct the multiplication, your answer will no longer have a percentage symbol.


In the example of 15% of 100, the result is the whole number 15.

 If you have a frozen iPad that won't turn off, performing a hard reset may fix the problem. Start by holding the Home button.
 Don't let go of either button.
 This may take 20 seconds or so.


If you can't get your iPad to reset, even after holding the Home and Sleep/Power button for up to a minute, see the next section.
 Once the reboot is complete, which may take a while, your iPad will load your Home screen. You can then power it down using the method in the previous section.

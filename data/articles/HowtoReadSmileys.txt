 A basic smiley should have eyes, a mouth, sometimes a nose. Here are some basic smileys;


Happy face- =)






Sad face- =(
Silly face- =P
Angry/Mad face- >:(
Surprised face- :O
Not amused face- =|
Winky Face ;);
, Try to note the tone of how the person is typing, are they mad, happy, or sad? Depending on the tone, the person will usually send a smiley that goes along with it. For example, it the person is talking about some that makes them happy or excited, they might send a happy face, :), or an excited face, ^O^.
 Examine your smiley from head to toe, or in this case eyes to mouth! Try to figure out what the smiley is representing.

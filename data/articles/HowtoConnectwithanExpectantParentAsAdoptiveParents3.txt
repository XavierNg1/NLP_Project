 You can’t buy children in the United States. However, you can generally advertise that you want to adopt. You can advertise in Craigslist or in the newspaper.Adoption advertising is regulated by the state, and each state has different laws. In some states, adoption advertising is outright prohibited.
You can find summaries of each state’s laws at the My Adoption Advisor website., Unlike adoption agencies, adoption facilitators are not licensed or regulated by the government. They are typically small organizations without a background in counseling. After they connect expectant parents with adoptive parents, the facilitator refers the families to an adoption agency to go forward with the adoption.Adoption facilitators have some advantages over adoption agencies. For example, wait times may be lower because they are skilled at finding pregnant women looking to give up a baby.
 Facebook may have pages related to adoption. You can join and then participate in the discussion, letting people know that you want to adopt. If no page exists in your area, then you can create one., In some states, you can have an “independent adoption” using an attorney and no adoption agency. An adoption lawyer can use their networking skills to find or advertise for a birth mother.You can find an adoption lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association and asking for a referral.
 Word of mouth is another good way to find expectant parents. Tell your family and friends that you want to adopt.They might know someone who is pregnant and looking to give the baby up for adoption.

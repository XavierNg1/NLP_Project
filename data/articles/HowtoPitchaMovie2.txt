 This pitch should be two to three sentences, lasting 1 to 2 minutes at most.Some experts call this pitch an "elevator pitch" because you should be able to say it in the time it takes to ride an elevator.
 If you apologize or say you don't believe in your story with your body language, you won't get anyone else to believe in it either., The pitch should interest movie executives as quickly as possible.In other words, tell the most interesting part of the story.
 The first sentence should name the primary character or characters.For example, you could say something to this effect: "Jessica Reese has had her heart broken too many times, until she falls for Joe Smith."

, The teaser needs to establish what the main conflict will be. Maybe your main conflict is a girl is trying to date a boy who doesn't seem to like her, or maybe your main conflict is a super villain trying to take over the world.For example, in the second sentence should show at least some of the conflict: "Jessica Reese has had her heart broken too many times, until she falls for Joe Smith. The problem is, he's the commander on her space ship, while she's a lowly ensign."

, The context of your story is the world your characters are living in. An 18th-century French drama is in a very different world than a 26th-century space adventure.Notice in the example above that you've keyed your listener into the fact that it's set in space, is in the science fiction genre, and that it's likely set in the future.
 That is, your audience should want to know more about your project from your pitch.For instance, at the end of this pitch, you could add: "Jessica Reese has had her heart broken too many times, until she falls for Joe Smith. The problem is, he's the commander on her space ship, while she's a lowly ensign. Jessica will stop at nothing to win his love... and endanger everyone in the process."

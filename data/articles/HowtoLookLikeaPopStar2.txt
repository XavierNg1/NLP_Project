 You don't need to stick to traditional hair colors. Instead, pick a fun bright color in an eye-popping shade. For example, pop icon Pink frequently sports bright colored hair, and Rhianna favors bright reds and oranges., Wearing a wig can keep your hair from the damaging effects of hair dye,and is especially useful if you want to frequently change the color of your hair, as pop stars often do. Wigs have the added benefit of protecting you from the potentially cancerous effects of some hair dyes.Look for wigs with different styles, such as short sleek bobs or shoulder-length curls. Lady Gaga frequently uses wigs and extensions in order to put her hair up into bows., This is an extremely popular option for male pop stars. Keep the sides of your hair cut short and leave a lot of hair on the top of your head for styling interesting hairdos. Comb over the top, revealing a part on one side of your head. Pink, Justin Bieber, and others frequently use this style.


Use a pomade, wax, or gel to keep the top of your hair in place.
 Don't try for the usual sophisticated updo. Create a unique, somewhat messy hairdo. For example, wear your hair in one giant braid (this works well with extensions), put your hair in two small buns on the top of your head, or shave one side of your head and keep your hair long on the other. Miley Cyrus has frequently sported edgy looks.

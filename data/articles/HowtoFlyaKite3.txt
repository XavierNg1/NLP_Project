 Assemble it per the instructions. Make sure to check the guidelines to determine the ideal wind speed for the kite., Hold up your kite by the bridle. Hold it up until it catches the wind.The bridle is the two or three strings that attach to the kite and the kite line.
 As soon as your kite catches the wind, let go of the bridle and begin to let some line out. The line should not be slack, but taut with a little give. Pull on the line to point the kite up. This will help the kite climb higher into the air., Tell your friend to hold the kite and walk downwind about 50 to 100 feet away from you. Have them hold the kite up in the air in front of them. Once the wind picks up, signal your friend to release the kite. As the kite gains altitude, pull on the line hand over hand until it is stable., If your kite sinks, then this means there is not enough wind. If you can, lower the bridle half of an inch down. If your kite nose dives or spins toward the ground, then the wind is too strong. In this case, move the bridle a half inch higher., Do this slowly to land your kite. As you reel it in, make sure the line is taut with a little give. As you reel in your line, walk toward your kite until it has landed safely on the ground.If your kite starts to spin, then the line is too taut. You will need to give it some slack at the point.

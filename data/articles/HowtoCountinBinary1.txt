 Our normal counting system is called decimal, or "base ten." We have ten different symbols for writing numbers, ranging from 0 to 9. Binary is a "base two" system, using only the symbols 0 and 1.;
, If a binary number ends in 0, you can count one higher by changing this to a 1. We can use this to count the first two numbers just as you would expect:


0 = zero
1 = one
For higher numbers, you can ignore the earlier digits of the number. 1010 + 1 = 1011.
 Now we have "1" for one, but we've already run out of symbols! In order to count to two, we need to write another digit. Add a "1" to the front of the number, and "reset" all the other digits to 0.


0 = zero
1 = one
10 = two
This is the same rule we use in decimal when we run out of symbols (9 + 1 = 10). It just happens a lot more often in binary because we run out of symbols sooner.
 These rules will get you as far as the number five. See if you can do it yourself, then check your work:


0 = zero
1 = one
10 = two
11 = three
100 = four
101 = five

, Now we need to solve five + one in decimal, or 101 + 1. The key here is to ignore the first digit. Just add the 1 + 1 at the end to get 10. (Remember, this is how you write "two".) Now restore the first digit and you get:


110 = six

, There are no new rules you need to learn. Try it yourself, then check your work with this list:


110 = six
111 = seven
1000 = eight
1001 = nine
1010 = ten

, Do you see that ten (1010) doesn't look like a "special" number in binary? Eight (1000) is much more important now, because it equals 2 x 2 x 2. Keep multiplying by two to find other important numbers like sixteen (10000) and thirty-two (100000).
 Now you know everything you need to count in binary. If you're ever confused about what comes next, just work out what happens to the last digits. Here are a few examples to help you out:


twelve plus one = 1100 + 1 = 1101 (0 + 1 = 1, and the other digits stay the same.)
fifteen plus one = 1111 + 1 = 10000 = sixteen (We've run out of symbols, so we reset to 0 and write a 1 at the start.)
forty-five plus one = 101101 + 1 = 101110 = forty-six (We know 01 + 1 = 10, and the other digits stay the same.)

 Go back to your Blackberry’s Gallery and select all the pictures, music, and videos that you want to move to your Android.
 Press the Blackberry Menu button once more and select “Send Using Bluetooth.” Your Blackberry device will start looking for available Bluetooth devices nearby.
 If you’ve enabled your Android’s Bluetooth, then your Blackberry should detect it. Select the name of your Android from the Blackberry’s list of detected nearby Bluetooth devices to bridge a connection and begin transferring the media files.


The time needed to move the files will depend on the sizes of the files to be transferred.
 After the media files have been moved, you can open it from the Gallery section of your Android device.

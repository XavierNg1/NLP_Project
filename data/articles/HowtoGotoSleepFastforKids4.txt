 A good mattress, soft sheets, and a comfortable pillow can all make sleeping easier for you. If your mattress is not comfortable, ask your parents about getting a new mattress or a mattress topper. If your sheets feel rough or uncomfortable, ask your parents about getting something more comfortable., If you live in a noisy area, you may want to start wearing earplugs or turn on a fan to provide some white noise. White noise helps to raise the noise level so that random noises will be less likely to wake you up.Ask your parents about getting some light and noise blocking curtains to make your room a quiet, dark space.
 People tend to sleep better with a cool room temperature of around 65°F (18.3°C).Ask your parents if it is okay to change the thermostat so that it is closer to 65 degrees. You can also put a fan in your room to cool it down.
 Making sure that your bedroom is an inviting, friendly place can make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. Try putting up a few pictures of your friends and family near your bed. Choose photos that make you smile and feel happy., Sleeping with a security item, such as a doll, blanket, or stuffed animal, can make you feel safe and fall asleep faster. Make sure that you grab your favorite toy or blanket before you get into bed.

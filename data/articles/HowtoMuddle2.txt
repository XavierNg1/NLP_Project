 Citrus fruits, cucumbers, and other fruits and vegetables can take a fair amount of pressure. A broad muddler is a great choice, especially if it has teeth to break into the skin. You can also improvise with the back of a wooden spoon, a mortar and pestle, or any blunt instrument.Stainless steel or heavy plastic provide more heft than wood.Note that fruit juice will stain some plastics., Cut citrus fruit into wedges, and hard ingredients such as cucumbers into Â¼ inch (6 mm) thick slices.Put these ingredients into a glass that you can press and grind without risk of chipping.


If using a mortar and pestle, put the ingredients in the mortar bowl instead.
 If you are using granulated sugar instead of simple syrup, add it now. Sugar will dissolve in fruit juice more readily than in alcohol, so incorporating it at this stage can save your cocktail from a gritty fate., Hold the glass steady and cup the end of the muddler with your dominant hand. Press the tool down steadily onto the fruit rather than bashing the glass. Press hard and twist, then release and repeat. You can press against the sides or base of the glass.
 The goal of muddling is to break up the peel and flesh to release flavorful oils and juices. You can stop when you smell a strong scent and see the ingredients release liquid, or continue muddling to intensify the flavor.


Citrus fruit can release plenty of bitter oils when muddled with prolonged force. This can work well in sugary drinks such as the caipirinha or mojito. Use a lighter touch when muddling for drinks with no added sugar.Cucumbers are ready after six or seven gentle presses.Press berries and other soft fruits until pulverized.

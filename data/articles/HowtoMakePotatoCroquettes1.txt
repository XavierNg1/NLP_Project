 Put the peeled and cut potatoes into a large pot, and cover them with salted water. Boil them for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they turn tender.;
, This not only helps dry the potatoes, but also firms them up a little.
 Don't worry about making them perfectly smooth. You actually want there to be some lumps and clumps.
 Keep mixing until everything is evenly combined. Remember to go easy on the salt because the onion salt will already have added some saltiness.
 Do not add the other two eggs; you will be using them for coating the croquettes.
 You will need about ¼ cup (80 grams) for each croquette. Roll the croquettes into oval-shaped balls first, then lightly flatten them with your palm. You don't want them to be completely flat. They should be plump, but flat enough so that they don't roll around.
 Place the croquettes onto a baking sheet lined with wax paper or parchment paper, then transfer them to the fridge. This will help firm the potato mixture up and prevent it from falling apart while frying.
,, Make sure that you coat both sides of each croquette evenly, and that you let any excess egg mixture drip off before you move onto the breadcrumbs.
 Fill the bottom of a 12-inch (30.48 centimeters) skillet with ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) of oil. Place the skillet onto the stove, and turn the heat up to medium-high. Let the oil heat up until it starts to simmer., Do not fry all of the croquettes all at once. Instead, work in small batches so that you have about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of space between the croquettes; this will allow them to cook evenly and prevent them from crumbling.After 4 to 5 minutes, flip the croquettes over using a spatula, and cook them for 4 to 5 minutes more.Add more oil as needed.
 These croquettes are great with sauce or ketchup.

 This assumes you have done some homework and tested different rounds.


Does it operate reliably (no jams)?
Does it shoot accurately out of the pistol? (This is a little hard to tell. It takes a lot of practice to be good enough to know that this good group and that bad group are due to ammunition differences, rather than because the shooter was more tired when he shot the bad group, or whatever else might have caused it, but if someone is good, they'll know.)
Is the ammunition designed to do the job the shooter has in mind? (Like, is it a good defense round, or a good target-shooting round, or a good hunting round... and for this, most folks depend on their dealer or on advertising. But if you buy ammunition that is designed to be, say, for self-defense, then check or reliability and accuracy, and you're probably ok.)

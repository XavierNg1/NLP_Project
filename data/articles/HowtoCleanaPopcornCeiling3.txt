 Paint rollers are soft and rounded so they don’t break apart the textures of the popcorn ceiling. Pick a thick-nap roller, ¾ inches (19 mm) thick or more. Also opt for an extension handle to make cleaning easier. The shape and softness of the roller will protect the popcorn texture from damage., Expose the roller to clean water. Try using a small flow from a faucet to splash or lightly coat the roller. You only need enough to make the roller feel damp. It should not drip at all.


Water can easily damage this delicate ceiling, so be cautious or consider hiring a professional.
 Push the paint roller over the dirty spots. Move in a line, applying an even coat of water. You don’t need to push hard against the ceiling. Rinse the roller when it gets dirty so it doesn’t spread any dust or dirt. Remember to squeeze out the excess moisture before using the roller again.
 If your ceiling has deeper stains, you’ll need to repeat the process with a cleaning solution. In a bucket of water, add a small amount of vinegar or mild dish or laundry detergent. The solution can be made with equal parts water and vinegar or detergent, but the more cleaning solution you use, the more abrasive it can be on the popcorn texture., Use your paint roller, keeping it damp instead of dripping, to roll even lines over the dirty portions of the ceiling. Alternatively, use a spray bottle. It requires climbing up on a ladder, but the spray bottle provides control over how much of the solution is applied to any spot. Allow the solution to sit and soak in. There’s no need to remove it, and trying to would put pressure on the popcorn texture.


Before you do this, you can also apply a stain-blocking primer such as Kilz.

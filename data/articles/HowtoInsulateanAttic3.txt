 Generally speaking, without any preexisting insulation in place, it takes 10–12 inches (25.4–30.5 cm) of loose fill to achieve an R-rating of about 38-40. Find the rough surface area of the base of your attic and ask the seller how many pounds of fill will be required to fill that area to 11 inches (27.9 cm) deep.
 Many home improvement stores offer blowing machine rentals for the DIY-minded. Remember, machine-blown fill insulation will be more effective than hand-filled, so unless you want inferior insulation from your material, rent a blowing machine when you buy your insulation.
 Soffit vents will need to be baffled (protected from getting clogged with fill insulation) before you work. Add one rafter vent baffle to each soffit vent.
 Carefully follow the instructions that come with your machine to set it up and begin blowing insulation with it. Blow your insulation in evenly and smoothly. Stop every few minutes to check the depth of the insulation and be sure it's more or less even. Keep going until the proper depth of insulation has been reached.

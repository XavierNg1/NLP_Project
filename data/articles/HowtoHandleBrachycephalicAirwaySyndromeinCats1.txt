 It is likely that your veterinarian will want to give your cat medication to relieve its symptoms. Corticosteroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications can be administered to temporarily relieve symptoms right away. Your cat will likely be given oxygen as well to improve its breathing.

It is not good for cats to be on corticosteroids long term, as they can cause a lot of side effects. This makes them only a good short term solution for brachycephalic airway syndrome.;
, Surgery is typically the preferred treatment for brachycephalic airway syndrome. However, depending on the exact airway irregularities your cat has, surgical treatment will vary and it may need one or more of procedures.

In order to fix stenotic nares, the surgeon will remove a section of tissue from the animal's nostrils.
An soft palate that is too long can be shortened by a veterinary surgeon.
If your cat has everted laryngeal saccules that are obstructing its larynx, these can be surgically removed in most cases.
 After a cat has surgery for brachycephalic airway syndrome, they will likely have more difficulty breathing while they recover, as the surgical area will be swollen. Because of this, it is important that the cat remain under veterinary supervision until swelling goes away and breathing is improved.

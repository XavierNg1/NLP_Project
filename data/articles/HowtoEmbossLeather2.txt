 Buy 3-D stamps with a cylinder that can be inserted into any of the flat stamps. You can order custom stamps online or start with a set of alphabet stamps.


Make sure the metal cylinder will match your stamps. The cylinder is the piece you use to pound the shape of the stamp into the leather.
 Make sure the front of the leather is facing up. Decide where you want to emboss your design.
 If the water changes the color of the leather drastically, wait for it to dry a little.
, Hold it firmly with one hand.
 Be careful not to move the stamp while you hit it. You can pick up the stamp, see if the impression is inlaid deep enough and align it for stamping again.It requires some practice to learn how hard to strike the stamp.
 Use a leather-finishing product when you have completed you embossing and before you assemble your final project.


You can also apply leather paint to the embossed design to give it more flair. Any alcohol-based paint can be applied before the leather is finished.

 Since your pectoral muscles are directly beneath your boobs, any increase in their size will make your breasts appear larger.,


Push-ups are a classic chest exercise, and target your pectorals while strengthening the rest of your body.
Do planks. Lay on your stomach, then prop yourself up on your forearms. Hold this pose for as long as you can, aiming for longer times each time you exercise. This exercise will improve your chest strength while working your whole body.
Do dips using two chairs. Place them on carpet so they don't slide, facing each other. Then kneel between them with your palms on the seats, holding your weight with just your arms. Tuck in your legs and lower yourself, then raise back up to the starting position. Repeat, adding more repetitions as you get stronger.
 Flexible plans will allow you to learn a moves over a couple of sessions and then continue to practice them on your own.
 The better your posture, the more your chest will be pushed up and out. Work to strengthen your back muscles so that good posture is comfortable, and then consciously correct yourself when you feel yourself begin to slouch.

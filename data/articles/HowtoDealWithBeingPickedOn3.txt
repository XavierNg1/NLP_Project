 Sharing your story can be helpful to others who are facing similar challenges. Write a blog or newsletter that explains your experience. Share what you are doing to confront the issue and make positive changes.
Talk to your peers. If you know someone who is being picked on, find time to share coping strategies and practice ways to respond to teasing.
For example, you can say, “Hey, I noticed that Jamie was annoying you. I hate it when he does that to me.”

, Do not encourage bullying behavior. Instead, help the person get out of the situation. Laughing at mean jokes or watching in silence suggests that you are not opposed to the behavior. Instead, let the bully know that you are not amused and/or walk away.
If you are a part of the conversation, try saying, “Hey, that’s not cool.”
If you see that someone is in physical or emotional danger, seek help from an authority figure immediately.
 Reach out to others who are going through the same problem. Developing a friendship can help you avoid confronting bullies by yourself. Plan to sit together at lunch or walk home together. You may develop a great friendship, and you will be able to support each other when faced with bullies.
Bring it up by saying, “Want to get lunch today?” or, “Let’s hang out on the way home.”

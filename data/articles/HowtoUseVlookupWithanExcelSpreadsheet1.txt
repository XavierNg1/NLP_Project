 Vlookup is a function in Excel that allows you to type the value of one cell to look up the value of a corresponding cell in the same row.


Use it to look up information from a large spreadsheet or if you have to find repetitive information.
Imagine being a teacher with a student list in Excel. You could use Vlookup to type the name of the student and immediately be given their grade from a corresponding cell.
Vlookup is helpful if you work in retail. You can search an item name and be given the item number or price in return.;
, The “v” in Vlookup stands for “vertical.” This means that your spreadsheet must be organized in vertical lists, as the function will only search columns, not rows.
 If you are using Vlookup for a business, you can format it for a table to calculate a price or discount on an item.

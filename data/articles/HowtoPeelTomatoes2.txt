 Wash the skin of the tomato thoroughly in cold water. Pat dry with some paper towel, then remove the stem., Insert the tines of the fork firmly into the stem-side of the tomato. The tomato should feel secure on the fork., The flame should be at a medium-high heat., Turn the tomato slowly, so that the heat reaches it evenly on both sides. Do this for about 15 to 25 seconds, until the skin starts to crack and blister. Think of it like toasting a marshmallow., Do not heat the tomato for any longer than 30 seconds, or it will begin to cook. Place it on a clean, flat surface until it is cool enough to handle., When you can handle the tomato comfortably, grab a piece of cracked skin and pull. The skin should come off very easily. Continue to pull away the skin until all of it has been removed.

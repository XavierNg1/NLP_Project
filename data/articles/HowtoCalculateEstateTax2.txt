 When determining the value of an asset, use the following guidelines:If the asset is owned individually, one hundred percent (100%) of its value should be attributed to the estate.
If the asset is personal property owned jointly with a spouse, with rights of survivorship, fifty percent (50%) of its value should be attributed to the estate.
If the asset is personal property owned jointly with any party, other than a spouse, with rights of survivorship, one hundred percent (100%) of its value should be attributed to the estate, unless you can prove the other owner contributed more than half of the value to the account

, Allowable deductions used in calculating estate taxes are listed on IRS Form 706, which can be found on the IRS’s website at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f706.pdf, and include:


Debts owed by reason of the decedent’s death - this includes final medical bills, funeral expenses, and attorney, court, and estate fees, paid out of the estate.
Debts owed at the time of death, or as of the date of calculation - this includes all utilities, credit card accounts, loans, mortgages, medical bills and expenses, and any other accounts due or incurred before the date of death or date of calculation.
The charitable deduction - this is the value of any property that passes from the estate to the United States, any state, a political subdivision of a state, the District of Columbia, or to any qualifying charity for exclusively charitable purposes.
The state death tax deduction - this includes any estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes paid as the result of the decedent's death to any state or the District of Columbia.
 Do this by subtracting the total allowed deductions from the gross value of the estate. For example, if the gross value of the estate is $600,000 and the total of all allowed deductions is $50,000, subtract $50,000 from $600,000 for a total taxable estate of $550,000.

 Your EPP will help you decide which of the three TExMaT tests (math, technology, science, or reading) you need to take. Without EPP approval, you cannot take the TExMaT., The latest registration fees, test dates, ID requirements, and testing sites are listed in the TExMaT registration bulletin, available at http://cms.texes-ets.org/registrationbulletin/. Check the bulletin and contact ETS after deciding which test site and time works best for you.


Give yourself a test date at least four months away so you have enough time to study for the test.
Tests are offered in the morning or afternoon. Some tests are offered only in the morning., Use the wealth of online test prep materials at http://cms.texes-ets.org/texmat/prepmaterials/ to prepare for your TExMaT test. Watch test familiarization videos and read “Tests at a Glance” to get a feel for what you might see on the actual test.Spend at least an hour each day studying for the test during the three to four weeks prior to your test date. The more preparation you have, the better you’ll do on the test.
 All tests consist of multiple choice questions and a case study section. If you’re a technology teacher, you will also need to take a section involving competency with spreadsheets and presentation software like PowerPoint.


Bring your admission ticket and two valid forms of ID to the test.Review all ID requirements carefully. You will need at least two forms of ID with signature, photo, and your name correctly spelled on each.

 Before forming an opinion, you want to make sure that you know the facts. If you think someone has a serious issue, it is a good idea to make sure that you actually understand the condition. Go to the library or ask a doctor for some good resources.


Avoid sites that have a particular religious or political bias.
Rely on objective sites such as Sex Help.Objective sites will include plenty of objective, scientific evidence and psychological research for their claims.;
, Thinking about sex a lot or frequently engaging in sexual activities doesn’t necessarily mean that a guy is obsessed with sex. In fact, sexual thoughts and actions are a normal part of life.This is true for boys going through puberty as well as for young and older men.


Remind yourself that both men and women of all ages have sexual urges and thoughts. It’s the way these thoughts and feelings are handled that distinguish normal behavior and sex obsession.
For instance, a guy may want to have sex several times a week with his partner. This could be considered normal sexual behavior, not a sign of sex obsession. It is also normal if you do not want to have sex this much. The difference in the amount that he wants to have sex versus the amount you want to have sex may just be an indication that you are not compatible.
 Sometimes guys, just like girls, want to display and receive affection and it may not have anything to do with sex. They may just want comfort and physical contact. It is perfectly normal for a guy to display affection without sex ever entering his mind. For example, a guy may just want to sit and cuddle with you and it may not have anything to do with sex.

 Whether you're using a charcoal, gas, or electric grill, get it heated to about 500ºF (260ºC).
 Unless your grill has a non-stick surface, coat it with non-stick cooking spray to prevent the meat from sticking to it.
 Place the steak in the hottest part of the grill, usually the middle. For rare, cook it for 2 minutes on each side and then move it to the cooler part of the grill, usually the edges, for another 6-8 minutes, flipping occasionally. For medium rare add 1-3 minutes and for medium add 3-5 minutes to the total cooking time.
 Remove the steak from the grill if it is charred to your liking. Use a small sharp knife, to make a small cut in the middle of the steak. If it looks done, allow it to sit for 10-15 minutes as this allows the flavors to mix and settle. If not, grill for another 1-2 minutes. Serve whole or sliced.

 If the fixture is easy to reach, such as a lamp, the process is pretty straightforward. Sockets do differ depending on your lighting fixture.


If you have a bayonet mount, which is common in the UK and places like New Zealand, hold the bulb gently but firmly, and then push down and turn the bulb counter-clockwise. This should release it from the socket. This type of socket has two prongs.
If the socket has a screw fitting, which is common in America and throughout Europe, you should gently twist the bulb counter clockwise. It should then come loose from the socket, and you can remove it.
 In order to put a new bulb into a lighting fixture’s socket, you will want to turn the bulb in a clockwise direction. Just remember: Counter-clockwise to remove; clockwise to insert.


The bulb might lock into place or you might have to twist it a bit until you can’t twist it anymore. This will depend on the socket. Don’t screw the bulb too tight or it could break. If you have a bayonet bulb, you will need to align the bulb’s base with the two pins. Push down and then twist upwards, using a clockwise motion.
In the case of a screw cap bulb, simply place it into the hole and then twist it. You will usually want to choose a bulb that has the same wattage as the old bulb, unless you want softer or brighter light than what you already had.
Check the label on the bulb socket or fixture for the max watt/amp rating. Make sure the bulb’s power rating doesn’t exceed that allowed by your lighting fixture (check with the manufacturer or packaging).

 Write down all the Schoolwork you have to do and then write the due date. That will be a little reminder. You can also write down when you want to study or the day of a test! Anything that you would like to remember about the school day. Some schools provide planners to students so in that case you will not need to buy one.;
, Try dividing the long-term goals into short-term ones as it make your work easierÂ ! Use diaries and planners to keep schedules . This is efficient not only for your school homework but also the extra-studies which you would like to do .
 Color coordinate the folders by each subject (e.g.: Language Arts (red), Math (blue), and so on). Keep all the Schoolwork from each subject inside it's own folder so everything isn't so messy. You would also want to color coordinate notebooks, too. Another good thing is to buy a homework folder so you won't be taking all your folders home. It saves up space in your backpack. Keep all these things in your binder so you won't lose any of them in the hallway or at home.
 That will help you know when due dates and tests are. Plus, you'll be learning more by paying more attention. Remember, listen more than taking notes.
 You can have a little snack first, but that's it. Go to your planner and check all the homework you have due the next day. Do that first. Then, you can start a little work that you have to hand in later on after.
 That way nothing is lost.

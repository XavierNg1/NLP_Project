 Most people are attracted to someone who has a healthy self-esteem. If you believe you're the shiz, you'll act like you're the shiz and girls will believe you're the shiz and want to find out why you're the shiz.


Don't try to become confident by getting the attention of girls. Not only will this never truly give you faith in yourself as a person, you're setting yourself up for a fall. Even the most handsome guy will go through dry patches but, if their confidence is founded on something stronger than their attractiveness, the rest of their life won't suffer and they'll come out the other side fighting.;
, Yes, you don't have a six pack but you might have great skin, hair, eyes or height. Never underestimate the power of such details.


Remember that you may not think of yourself as the most handsome man to walk the earth but there will always be several guys who would give their right arm to look like you. They are not always the people you would expect either.
You're pretty unlikely to be the heaviest man around. Guess what? There have been guys and girls much bigger than you that have found flings and true love.
 You have to cut potential girls a little leeway. Go for someone you find attractive, definitely, but accept that they might not always be a 10. Look past the physical and into the character and soul of the person you fancy. Not only will your insistence on finding someone beautiful inside and out make you more attractive to girls, it will make sure that you find someone truly special and worthy of you.


This goes for every guy and girl you'll ever meet and everyone realises it, sooner or later. It has nothing to do with your size or level of attractiveness.

 In the USA "five-year survival rates" (perhaps in remission, or not) for some cancers, such as breast, prostate, and thyroid cancers, now exceed 90 percent.The inability to detect pancreatic cancer earlier with simple screening tests is a huge problem; as such, it has become an important focus of medical research today.


The reason that there are no useful cancer "blood-screening test" available for the general population (those who are not at high risk) are because the current blood tests being considered by medical professionals are not reliable or accurate, and they provide no significant improvement at detecting pancreatic cancer early.
The other screening options (those that directly visualize the pancreas and are offered to high risk people) are more accurate but are too costly to the patients and medical system for general use.
 This makes it to unlikely for the patient to ask for a diagnose as it does not cause one to feel sick, and also much harder to diagnose such pancreatic cancers in a timely manner. Also for most patients with this (sneaky) exocrine pancreatic cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.A hopeful cure for a rare, malignant pancreatic tumor type, arising from islet cells, "neuroendocrine (PNET)," has a much better prognosis than pancreatic exocrine cancers with approved medications for them., He or she can then order investigative tests to determine whether or not it is cancer. Common symptoms of pancreatic cancer include:


Yellow discoloration of your skin and of the whites of your eyes (called "jaundice") caused by high liver enzymes such as bilirubin (red-bile)
Pain in your upper abdomen that may radiate to your back and back of the rib cage
Unexplained weight loss, because of sugar metabolism problems caused by the diseased pancreas
Decreased appetite, as food taste differently if you have yellow jaundice.
 The purpose of the blood test would be to test for some sort of marker(s) that are shown to be correlated with a heightened risk of pancreatic cancer.


Those who are deemed to be at heightened risk from the screening blood test would then receive more detailed testing from their physician, to determine whether or not there is in fact any cancer present.
 Hopefully in the near future enough information will be gathered for the medical community to come up with effective tests that can be made available to the general population to screen for pancreatic cancer.

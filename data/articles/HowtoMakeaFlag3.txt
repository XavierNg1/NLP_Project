 The beauty of this flag banner is that it's so easy to make, so you can use whatever material you like. Just try to choose a variety of pretty patterns and bright colors to really make your flag banner pop! Having around five different types of flag is a good base to work from.
 Before you start cutting, you will need to decide how big you want each triangular flag to be - remember that they should be isosceles triangles with two long sides and a shorter base.









Once you have decided on your measurements, cut out a template flag and use it to cut out the rest of the triangles - how many you need will depend on how long you want the banner to be.
If you want to add a little something extra to your flag banner, try cutting out the triangles with a pinking shears. This will give them a zig-zagged edge instead of a straight one!

, How you do this will depend on whether you used paper or fabric for your flags. If you used paper, you can punch 3 to 4 holes at the top of each flag and simply thread a piece of string, ribbon or twine through the holes to hang the flags. If you used fabric, you can either sew the top edge of each flag around a piece of twine or ribbon (which is time consuming) or you can use a bead of fabric glue to attach the string, for an easier option.
 Hang your flag banner by tying the ends of the string to nails in the wall, or use a thumbtack to secure. Flag banners look great draped in front of the fireplace, as a festive addition to an outdoor party or barbecue, or as a cute decoration for classrooms and children's bedrooms.

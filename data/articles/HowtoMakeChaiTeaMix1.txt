 This chai masala mix is made using whole, rather than ground, spices for a fresher and more pungent flavor. To begin making the masala, place the black pepper, dried ginger pieces and whole cloves into a small bowl.If you don’t have access to the whole spices, you can substitute ground spices. Use ½ the amount of ginger, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon if you are using ground spices.;
, Measure out ½ cup (118.3 ml) dried cardamom pods and place them on a cutting board. Use a small, sharp paring knife to make a small incision through one side of each pod of cardamom. Then place the pods in the bowl with the other spices.Making a cut through the cardamom pods ensures that the flavor of the cardamom seeds within the pods can escape and spice the tea.
 Break each cinnamon stick into smaller pieces, about 4 pieces for each stick of cinnamon. If you are using thin cinnamon sticks, you can break them by hand. If you are using thicker cinnamon sticks, use gardening sheers or a large steak knife to cut through the sticks.

You can also substitute ¼ cup (59.15 ml) of ground cinnamon in place of whole cinnamon sticks.
 Place the pieces of cinnamon stick into a spice grinder and grind the cinnamon. Grind until the cinnamon becomes a coarse, crumbly mixture. Then add the cinnamon to the rest of the spices.You don’t need to make the cinnamon a fine powder, you just need to grind it enough so that you can stir the cinnamon chunks into the rest of the masala. This way each spoonful of masala you may use will contain cinnamon.
 Stir all the ingredients of your chai mix together, then pour the masala mix into a sealable container. Place the lid on the container and store it for up to month in a cool, dark area of your kitchen.

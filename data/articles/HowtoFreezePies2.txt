 Pies that lack a firm filling—such as fruits or nuts—are more difficult to successfully freeze. Due to their liquid consistency, custard and cream pies can make the pie crust soggy.If you were planning to freeze your custard pies for a short amount of time, consider refrigerating them instead.
Meringue pies—such as lemon meringue—are also difficult to freeze, for the same reasons. Try to serve these fresh to maintain the taste and consistency of the pies.
 The primary problem with freezing custard or cream pies is that the custard or cream filling will break down and become soggy, rendering the crust soggy as well.Avoid this problem by freezing the custard filling separately from the pie crust.

Freeze the baked pie crust (do not freeze raw dough).
Freeze the custard, cream, or pumpkin filling in an airtight plastic container; a Tupperware would do nicely.
Avoid freezing pumpkin pies for more than 4-5 weeks.


Give your custard or cream filling about 24 hours to thaw fully in your refrigerator.
 Unlike baking a fruit or nut pie, you should not bake the custard filling in a raw pie crust. After your pie filling has finished thawing for 24 hours, pull the frozen crust out from your freezer. Bake the pie crust until it is golden brown, then add the custard, cream, or pumpkin filling and finish making the pie as the recipe suggests.

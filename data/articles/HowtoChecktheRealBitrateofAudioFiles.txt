 Though audio quality depends on many elements such as frequency, compressing method, up-scaled, etc., but for almost audio files downloaded on the Internet that have not been up scaled, if the bit rate is high (~128 kbps or higher), then the sound will be clearer and "more comfortable" to hear. If the bit rate is low, you may hear it blurring, noisy and unclear.;
, It is easy to convert a low quality 64 kbps MP3 file into a (so called) high quality 500 kbps M4A file. This action is called "upscaling". After upscaling, the audio quality is still not improved and it may be worse.
 The spectrum (or chart) is a graph which shows the frequency (in kHz) and the loudness (in dB). Many free programs such as Spek can help you build the audio chart/spectrum.
 Observe the graph. Notice the cut-offs. The position of cut-offs can tell you the bitrate of the file. Cut-off is the line put at where the graph cannot reach higher. For example, an 128 kbps audio graph will be cut-off at 16 kHz. Note: The red line in the image below is not existed when you use an audio spectrum analyzer.
 Cut-off at 11kHz.
MP3 file, Bitrate 128 kbps. Cut-off at 16 kHz.
MP3 file, Bitrate 192 kbps. Cut-off at 19 kHz.
MP3 file, Bitrate 320 kbps. Cut-off at 20 kHz.
M4A file, Bitrate 500 kbps. Cut-off at 22 kHz.
FLAC file, Lossless quality (Bitrate usually 1000 kbps or higher). Graph's drawn continuously, no cut-off.
 Its bitrate tag reads 320 kbps but the actual quality is 192 kbps.

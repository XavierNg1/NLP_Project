 In the cosmetic section of the drugstore you'll find shelves of products designed to have a lip-plumping effect. These glosses and chapsticks usually contain ingredients like cinnamon oil or capsaicin, the substance that makes hot peppers hot. These ingredients slightly irritate the skin, causing it to plump up temporarily.


Lip-plumpers are usually quite glossy, which creates an even poutier appearance.
Caffeine is also commonly found in lip plumpers, so check the ingredients if you're sensitive to it.;
, Cinnamon is a mild irritant that can safely plump up your lips a little. Try sprinkling a little cinnamon powder on your old toothbrush (the one you are not using) then using it to brush your lips. Gently scrub your lips until they become full and flushed.









Try making your own cinnamon plumping gloss by mixing a little cinnamon into a teaspoon of coconut oil. Place it in an old chapstick jar and use it whenever your lips need a boost.
Feeling a little tingly is normal, but if your lips feel painfully irritated after using cinnamon, discontinue use and try another method.
 Mint, similarly to cinnamon, has a mildly irritating effect that can cause the lips to swell a little. A great natural way to plump your lips is by rubbing on a few drops of peppermint oil.


Make your own plumping gloss by mixing 5 drops of peppermint oil with a teaspoon of coconut oil. Store it in an old chapstick jar.
If your lips feel irritated by the peppermint, use another method.
 This method isn't for the faint of heart, but it works! Take a small piece of jalapeno or another moderately spicy pepper and rub it over your lips. In a moment or two, your lips will start to swell, much like they do when you eat hot salsa or hot sauce.


Don't try this with habaneros or other very hot peppers, since the experience might get uncomfortable.
You could also dab a little dried pepper powder, such as cayenne, into your lips for a plumping effect.

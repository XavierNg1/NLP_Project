 Avocado is great for your skin as it contains essential fatty acids, vitamin E, and biotin. These natural ingredients can help to lighten acne scars and keep your skin moisturized. Start by removing the avocado from the skin and mashing it up with a fork or a spoon.If the avocado is soft and ripe, it should mash up easily in a bowl. Use the sharp edge of the fork or spoon to mash it until it forms a lumpy paste.
 Pour 1-2 drops of tea tree oil in the bowl with the avocado. Using more can cause your skin to react badly to the mask, as tea tree oil can burn your skin if you apply too much of it. Mix the tea tree oil into the avocado with a spoon., Before you apply the mask, wash your face with your normal cleanser. This will ensure your face is properly prepared for the face mask.
 Use clean fingers to apply the mask to your face. Make sure you spread the mask in an even layer over your entire face., Lay down and let the mask settle into your skin. It should dry over the course of 10-15 minutes as the ingredients absorb into your skin.
 After 10-15 minutes, use warm water to wash off the mask. It should come off easily with the water. Do not scrub or rub your face hard to remove the mask.


Once the mask has been removed, use a clean towel to pat your face dry.

 You don't have to use those cute toys for writing mistakes, you know! Depending on the size of your stuffed animal, they can be small-to-medium-size. They can be expensive, being around five to ten dollars a set. However, they are very detailed, fun, and easy to find, whether online or at a retailer.

Shake up the sets. Do you want fast food? Chinese food? Desserts or fruits? The greater your range of options, the greater the fun.;
, Doll food typically has the right size, amount of fun, and attention to detail. You have a great range - from hamburgers to pears and more!

Try different brands. American Girl Dolls and My Generation are easier to find and probably your best bet.

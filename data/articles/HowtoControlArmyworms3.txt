 In order for your natural approach to be effective, you must catch the infestation early. In early spring, begin monitoring for the presence of moths, and/or damage to your plants.Armyworm moths are grey with distinctive white dot on their forewings.
You may choose to set pheromone traps to catch moths. This will allow you to get a better look at their markings.
 If you've caught the problem early in the season (late spring or early summer), you can release trichogramma wasps. These wasps will parasitize and ultimately kill armyworm eggs.You can purchase these wasps from some garden supple stores, or online.
 Unfortunately, the use of pesticides and insecticides can kill beneficial insects, along with armyworms. Instead, by encouraging the presence of these insects, as well as birds, you can naturally keep your armyworm population at bay. You can do this by avoiding the use of insecticides/pesticides, and by planting wildflowers., If the introduction of other pests has not done enough to quell your armyworm problem, try using neem oil spray. Apply neem oil spray to your crops, making sure to cover stems and the undersides of leaves, as well. Avoid watering for at least 1-2 days after application.Neem oil can be destructive to armyworms at various stages of their development.
Additionally, neem oil is anti-fungal.

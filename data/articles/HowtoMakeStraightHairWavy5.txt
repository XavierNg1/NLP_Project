 Follow your usual routine for washing your hair. Add conditioner and rinse it out. Use a towel to dry your hair so that it is just damp.
 Use foam mousse, styling cream or texturizer to your hair. Make sure it’s spread throughout your hair. Focus on the mid-length to the ends of your hair.


If you have pretty short hair, don’t use hair product on your roots. This can make your hair look stringy.
 Each chunk of hair will be about 1-2 inches wide. It might help to pin up some of the hair around the crown of your head so you can work with the hair underneath.The bigger the sections, the wavier your hair will be. If you have very small sections of hair, your hair will end up more as curls.
 Roll the end of the section around your index finger and thumb. This will make a loop. Then keep rolling the hair around the loop up to the scalp.
 When you’ve curled the entire section of hair up to your scalp, use a bobby pin to keep the curl against your head.
 Pin up the rest of your hair in the same manner. You’ll have lots of bobby pins in your hair. Be sure to pin them against your head so that they don’t stick out and poke into your head.
 Go to sleep in your pinned-up hair. If you’ve secured the bobby pins flat against your head, then you shouldn’t get poked by any of them in your sleep., When you wake up, remove the bobby pins. Shake out your hair by turning your head upside down and tossing your head around.









If you don’t shake out your hair and run your fingers through it, your hair will still be curly. To make it wavy, run your fingers through your hair or use a brush to soften the curls into waves.
 Spritz some hairspray on your hair to hold the style.

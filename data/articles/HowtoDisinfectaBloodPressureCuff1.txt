 Gloves will protect you from blood and other bodily fluids that might have contaminated the equipment. If you do not have gloves, wash your hands for 20 seconds with warm water and soap. Hand washing is still the most effective way of preventing cross-contamination of harmful bacteria.;
, Ensure you thoroughly check the tubing as well. As you inspect the cuff, be careful not to touch any stain that you do see, especially if you are not wearing gloves. Although the cuff may not have visible stains, harmful bacteria can still linger on the cuff. , You can remove the tubing and inflation bag by undoing the velcro strap or unbuttoning the side pocket. If it does not appear as though the tubing can be removed, check the manufacturerâ€™s guidelines and clean according to their specifications.


No water should enter the tubing or the inflated pump during cleaning. Be extremely careful as you handle it around water. The cuff itself can be completely soaked and washed, so long as you ensure that is completely dry before you reinsert the tubing.
 If you cannot disinfect the cuff immediately, place the cuff in a bucket with warm, soapy water. This will prevent any potential stains from settling on the cuff, and it will prevent contaminants from spreading in the meantime. Do not soak the tubing. Set it aside in a sterile bag until you are able to disinfect it.


This is generally appropriate for the end of the day of a personal cuff. In a clinic or hospital setting, when the cuff must be reused quickly, using with a disposable disinfecting wipe is appropriate. This takes only a few minutes (and is described later in this article).

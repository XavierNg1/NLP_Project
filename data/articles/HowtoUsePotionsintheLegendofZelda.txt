 Every town in every version of the game has a shop you can buy potions from. Just approach the attendant to buy one. There are three types of potions you can buy, namely:


Red Potion – Costs around 30 Rupees. When used, it refills one of Link’s heart containers. It’s the generic type of potion, available in all versions of the game.
Green Potion – Costs around 30 Rupees. When used, it fully refills Link’s magic gauge. Green potions are available in games where Link can use spells, like A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, and The Wind Waker.
Blue Potion – Costs around 100 Rupees. It has the combined effects of a red and green potion. It can refill all of Link’s heart containers and the magic gauge all at the same time. Just like with green potions, blue potions are available only in games where Link can use spells, like A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, and The Wind Waker.;
, If you want to save on Rupees, you can get free potions from treasure boxes found in dungeon rooms. The type of potions you can get from treasure chests are at random, however, and it’s not a 100% chance that you’ll get one.
 Killing low level enemies, like Moblins or Octoroks, can sometimes drop potions. However, just like obtaining one from treasure chests, it’s only by chance and at random that you’ll get a potion., Press the “Start” button on your controller to open Link’s bag and show your character’s item inventory.
 Use the arrow keys on your controller to move around the inventory list and highlight the potions. Once selected, press the Action button where you want to assign the potions to, and press the “Start” button again to go back to the game screen.
 Back in the game screen, press the “Action” button where you assigned the potion to and Link will use it, replenishing his heart container, magic gauge, or both.

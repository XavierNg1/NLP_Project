 Do this in the spring.


Wait until newly-planted herbs and perennial herbs that have survived the winter begin to grow again.
Use 3 ounces of fertilizer per 30 square feet.;
, These will not provide the right balance of nutrients for healthy herbs., This will help to wash it down to the root zone.
 If it does get on the leaves, wash it off immediately with clear water from the garden hose.
 Keep in mind that too much fertilizer will cause herbs to grow too quickly, resulting in leaves that are deficient in the essential oils that give them their flavor.


Too little fertilizer will cause herbs to grow slowly, produce fewer, smaller leaves and look generally weak and unhealthy.
 Herbs grown in containers must be watered more often, sometimes as often as every day, because of the smaller volume of soil around their roots which dries more quickly than garden soil. This frequent irrigation will quickly wash the fertilizer out of the soil.
 You need to dilute the fertilizer at half the rate recommended by the manufacturer.


A common dilution rate is 1 tablespoon per gallon of water, which should be cut down to 1 ½ teaspoons per gallon for herbs.
Do not use garden fertilizer as it is too strong and could burn the herb’s roots., Then, pour the fertilizer solution evenly over the soil until it begins to drain from the bottom of the container.
 This can burn their roots.
 Outdoor container-grown herbs need to be given fertilizer every three to four weeks.


You should not give indoor herbs fertilizer during the winter as they naturally grow more slowly in the winter and will not use the fertilizer. If it is given to them during the winter, it will burn their roots and cause dried, brown leaf edges.

 After an application is filed, the USPTO will conduct their own patent search to check for duplicates and conflicting inventions.


During examination, the examiner will typically ask for clarification of your invention or for a narrowing of the scope of protection sought. In addition, there is no guarantee that any application will eventually be granted as a patent. The examination process will vary in duration depending on the nature of your invention and schedule of the patent office.
During the "patent pending" phase of your application, you may try to sell or exploit your invention without fear of losing any rights to the invention.
 If your patent application is approved, you will be sent a Notice of Allowance and Fee(s) Due. Pay the fees within three months from the date on the notice to avoid having your application abandoned.
 After the payments are received, you will be issued your patent as soon as possible. Timing will depend on the amount of printing required and the workload of the USPTO.
, To maintain a patent in force, you must pay fees due at 3 1/2, 7 1/2, and 11 1/2 years from the date the patent is granted. If you fail to pay these fees, your patent may expire early.
 A patent is personal property and may be sold, mortgaged, bequeathed by a will, or passed to future heirs. A written document is required to transfer a patent.

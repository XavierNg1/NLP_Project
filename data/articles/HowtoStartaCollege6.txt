 Accreditation is an essential step for colleges because it will set your institution apart from the so-called "diploma mills" that do not have appropriate educational programs in place and do not meet educational requirements for issuing diplomas or degrees.


You can apply for accreditation once you have students and have begun teaching your courses. Accreditation is a process in which your institution is reviewed by a peer review group to determine the quality of the program you offer.
The U.S. Department of Education has a list of regionally and nationally recognized accrediting agencies for higher education online.

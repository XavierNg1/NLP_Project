 It's just a game after all, and if you treat it like real life, how would you like aliens with blasters to actually be shooting at you? Exactly, be glad it's only a game.;
, A very good way to make something so completely easy, is setting something to hard mode. Play hard mode a bit, then switch back to easy or medium. It will be so easy you'll wonder why you couldn't do it before.

 To prevent it from falling over when using, add something to the base of it such as a stone, a few pebbles wrapped in newspaper or some other similarly weighted object. Glue to the base of the container to prevent it from shaking around.
 Wind the thick piping cord around and around the outside of the container. Glue each round in place as you go.


If you run out of a length, simply cut some more piping and join as neatly as you can, trying to hide the join.
Cut the piping neatly where it finishes at the top of the container.
 Use a large, sturdy needle to pierce through the plastic or paper container.
 Soft toy stuffing, batting, old scraps of fabric, etc., will all work. Pile up a little at the top, to create the rounded effect of a pincushion.

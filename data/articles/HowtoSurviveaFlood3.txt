 Flood insurance can save you a lot of hassle if your home or business is damaged. Check with your insurance company for policy details. If you are in a high-risk area for floods, you should be insured. People in other areas may choose flood insurance to protect against water damage., Sealing your basement makes it more resistant to water. Fill in cracks and spread sealant over the walls. Keep the gutters on your house clean, too. Levees and floodwalls may also be built to help hold back floodwater.Install a sump pump. When the pump senses water on the floor, it pumps it out of your home. Make sure the pump drains properly and maintain its battery-powered backup with fresh batteries.
 Raise up your furnace, water heater, and electric panels. They should be installed on top of blocks or set higher in the wall than normal. This will better prevent them from getting wet. Before a flood occurs, store all valuables, such as expensive rugs, appliances, and important documents, on a higher floor in your home.Disconnect your utilities when thereâ€™s potential for a flood. Shut off the main valves and breakers. Unplug all electrical appliances unless you are standing in water.Take care of valuables before flooding begins. You may not have time to do this once the water starts rising

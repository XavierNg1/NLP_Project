 You can put as many questions as you need in the survey, but you’ll need to have at least one. Start with the question you want to ask.
 You can add help text to guide the respondents in answering the question. Use this to explain anything that may be confusing in the question, or to add context.
 Indicate what type of answer is acceptable for the question. Click the drop-down list to see the options. You can set it to Text, Multiple Choice, Checkboxes, Scale, and others.
 Depending on your Question Type, the next field item will change. Put the acceptable answers in the provided fields. For example, if you chose Multiple Choice, you have to indicate the choices to be given to your respondents. Each Question Type has additional "Advanced settings" you can change as well.
 There’s checkbox at the bottom of the question to make it a required question. Tick on it if you want it to be mandatory, meaning an answer is required before proceeding to the next one.
 If you have another question to add to the survey, click the “Add item” button below it.

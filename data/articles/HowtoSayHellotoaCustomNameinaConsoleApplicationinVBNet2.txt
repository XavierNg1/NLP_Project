 Click on "New Project" or if you're homepage is not being displayed for some reason, click on the file tab at the top and then click on New Project.
 The name part is only important in case you want to look for this project again. Then you have something to stand out in the file explorer.
 You are now declaring something and this plays a key role in getting the user's name and using it in a sentence.
 The "name" part can be anything you would like but it would just be a bit clearer. However, the "As String" part MUST be there as you need to make sure that the computer reads words, not numbers or other things.
 The first one, Console.Writeline("What is your name?") asks for your name. The Console part is telling the computer to do something whilst the Writeline is an extension telling it to write something onto the application. The text inside the speech marks inside the brackets is what's going to appear on the screen.
 Again, the console part is telling it's for the computer, the readline tells the computer to store the answer from the first line of text into the name that we declared earlier.
 The {0} represents the first variable being used because in this type of situation, you will ALWAYS start with a 0. The ,name part brings out the custom name that is stored out through the {0} part.
, If that happens then you have coded the application correctly.

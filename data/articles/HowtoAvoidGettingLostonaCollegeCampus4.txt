 If you are living in student housing, your designated Resident Assistant is a great resource. The RA is an upperclassman and has been on the campus for at least one semester longer than you. Find your RA and ask them the best route to get to your class or any other building on the campus.
 Start befriending other students you see in your dorm and class. By making friends, you have less of a chance of getting lost because youâ€™ll most likely be heading to the same place. This is also advantageous because if you do get lost, you won't be by yourself.
 If you know beforehand who your professors will be, send them an email introducing yourself. This will make for a good impression with the professor and in the event you get lost and end up late to class on the first day, they will be much more understanding.

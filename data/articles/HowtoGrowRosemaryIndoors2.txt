 A window that faces south or west may be the best choice. Your rosemary needs, at minimum, six hours of direct sun.
 If you do not have a window that can provide your plant with adequate sun, fluorescent grow lights can work just as well. Place the lights 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) above the top of your plant and leave it on for 14 hours per day.
 Rosemary thrives in a little dryness, but do not allow the soil to dry out completely. When you water, do so thoroughly, but do not allow the soil to become soggy.
 During the spring, summer, and autumn, the room's natural humidity should suffice. During dry winters when the furnace comes on, however, you may need to provide your rosemary with extra humidity by sitting the pot on a humidity tray, or by running a humidifier in the room a few hours each day.
 Feeding your rosemary once or twice a month with a balanced liquid fertilizer should do fine. Dilute the fertilizer with equal parts water before applying it to your plant.
 Rosemary can get powdery mildew if the air around it grows too stagnant and stale. Letting a fan blow on it for a few hours each day dramatically improves air circulation and decreases this risk.
 You can also treat your rosemary before it gets a fungal disease, but many gardeners prefer to use as few chemicals as possible, making post-disease treatment more favorable than preventative treatment.
 Indoor plants do not get infested as often, but it can still happen. Neem oil is harmless to humans and most pets, making it safe to use on plants intended for consumption.
 Snipping above a joint allows new growth to continue forming on that stem. Never remove more than 1/3 of the plant at one time.

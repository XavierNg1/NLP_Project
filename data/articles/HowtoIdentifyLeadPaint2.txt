 You can buy a home testing kit for lead-based paint at your local hardware store or online. The kit will require you to test a sample of the paint for any lead. These kits are relatively inexpensive and easy to use.Keep in mind home test kits for lead paint are not always reliable. They will not be as accurate as a professional test on the paint.
 Contact your landlord if you are a renter so they can arrange a professional test on the paint in your home. You can also contact your local department of health or a lead testing service in your area. Professional, qualified individuals can then test the paint in your home for a small fee., The professional test should tell you if there is lead paint in your home and if so, if it is hazardous to your health. Lead paint that is in good condition, where it is not peeling, chipping, or flaking, is not considered a health hazard.If there is lead paint in your home that is in good condition, you should still keep an eye on it to make sure it does not become damaged or start to deteriorate.

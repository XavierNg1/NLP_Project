 Cut into the short side of a cardboard box. This way, the light shining through the hole can travel the length of the box to the other side. Letting the light travel the length of the box will enlarge the image. You should use a box that is no less than six feet long to produce a clear, viewable image.If you do not have a cardboard box that is six feet long, you can cut smaller pieces of cardboard and tape or glue them together to make a box that is the appropriate length.;
, Tape a piece of aluminum foil to cover the box. Aluminum foil will block excess light from shining through the hole you created. Be sure that the foil is pulled tight so that it is smooth., Use a toothpick or a needle to prick a hole in the center of the aluminum. This will allow just a small amount of light to be focused through the hole and projected at the other end of the box. This will provide an image of the the sun that is safe to look at.

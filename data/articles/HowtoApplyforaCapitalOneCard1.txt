 Before applying for any credit card, you should take some time to inform yourself about the options available to you. Visit the Capital One website or do you own research to compare the cards they offer.


Some websites allow you to do a side-by-side comparison of all the cards available.Look at the options and see which card best meets your needs. Consider your credit rating and history, income, the incentives that most interest you (e.g. travel miles, cash back, etc.), the interest rates and fees, the credit limit, and whether the card is for personal or business use.Generally speaking, you want to choose a card with a low interest rate and as few fees as possible. Keep in mind that if your credit is poor (or non-existent), you may have to accept a card with less favorable terms until you have built up a better credit score.;
, Capital One routinely sends out offers for cards based on which cards people are most likely to be approved for. The offers come both by email and the postal service.If you've received one or more of these offers, there's a good chance you will be approved for the card or cards described. Review the terms of the offer letter, including the credit limit, interest rate, fees, and incentives to determine whether this is a card you would be interested in applying for.
 Whether you've received an offer in the mail or not, you can take Capital One's pre-qualification survey. This survey will ask you some general questions about your income and credit history, as well as which incentives interest you most.This survey can be found on the Capital One website by clicking on "See if You're Pre-Qualified" under the "Credit Cards" tab.
Based on your responses, you will be presented with some options for cards that you are likely to be approved for and which meet your needs.
This survey is not a credit card application, it is just a way to determine which card or cards would be best for you.

 Wool can be used for tatting but the yarn quality is vital. The wool must be very smooth in its texture; avoid any wool that shows signs of fluffiness, knotting, grabbing, etc. If you're not sure, test it first by sliding a piece up and down the shuttle to see how easily (or not) it glides when pushed. A wool that slides easily will be suitable for the tatting project. Also check the instructions for your given project and see the note in "Tips" below.

 The packaging of the dog biscuits and other treats is a part of your brand, so it should be something that gives buyers a good impression.


Decide on a logo for your business. Use a dog design (dog's head, a whole dog, a paw mark, etc.) in colors that are clear and can be used throughout your product line.
 Unless the particular product is impacted by light, clear cellophane is a great way to package baked dog goodies. People can see the shape, texture and colors through this material and be attracted to it.
 This includes Halloween, the holiday season and summer vacation time.

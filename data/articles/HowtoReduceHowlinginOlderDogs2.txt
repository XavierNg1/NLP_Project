 If your vet identified a medical problem as the cause of your dog’s howling, treating that problem will help reduce the howling. Older dogs can develop arthritis, which can be so painful that a dog will howl with distress.If your dog has arthritis, your vet will prescribe an anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain.After experiencing pain relief, your dog may not howl so much.
Administer the pain medication as prescribed so your dog gets the maximum benefit from the treatment.
 Howling, especially at night, is a common symptom of dementia in older dogs. Although dementia has no cure, medication can help reduce the symptoms. If your dog has dementia, your vet will prescribe a drug called Anipryl, which improves brain function in dogs.Anipryl probably won’t make your dog’s howling stop completely. However, it can help reduce the howling.
 Let your vet know if the medications are helping to reduce the howling. If your dog’s howling is still the same, your vet may need to adjust the drug dosage or prescribe a different type of medication.

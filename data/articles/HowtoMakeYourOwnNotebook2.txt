 You should be able to find everything you need to make a pocket notebook at your local craft store. A rotary cutting mat isn't necessary, but may be useful if you don't have another flat surface to cut on. You'll need the following to make your notebook:Craft knife
PVA glue
Stapler
Graph paper
11x14 Bristol board
Paper cutter
Ruler or straight edge
Corner punch
Large rotary cutting mat

, Trim 10-12 sheets of graph paper and one sheet of Bristol board to 7" x 5.5" using your paper cutter., You can make a cover out of plain Bristol board if you like, or you can make your cover more decorative. Use anything from old repair manuals to comic books to personalize your notebook.Apply a layer of PVA glue to your Bristol board. Make sure you have enough to create a firm bond, but don't add so much that it ruins your board.Spread the glue out so that it covers the entire piece of Bristol board. Lay the board on your chosen cover and smooth it out using a ruler or straight edge. Try to remove any air bubbles that might pop up.Trim any excess cover material from the edges using your craft knife., Stack your sheets of graph paper so the edges are flush. Place your cover on top of the graph paper, keeping all the edges flush, and use your ruler to measure 3.5" in.If it helps, mark the middle of your cover with a pencil so you know where the spine is.
 Keeping the pages straight, add at least three staples down the spine of your notebook. Space your staples evenly down the spine.Use a straight edge on the center fold. Place your ruler along the staples and fold one end of your notebook over. This will ensure you get a straight fold and will keep your notebook even.Use a corner punch if you plan on carrying your notebook around in your pocket or purse. Rounding the corners can help keep the pages from getting bent.

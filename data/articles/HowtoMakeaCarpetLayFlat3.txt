 First, purchase a container of carpet seam sealer large enough to address the amount of floor area in question. Additionally, pick up a food syringe. Remove the sealer’s cap and draw an adequate amount into your syringe., First, locate the bubble. Feel with your fingers to estimate its circumference. Once you have an idea of where its edges are, grip its center with a pair of pliers. Then puncture the center with the syringe’s needle., Continue lifting the bubble up by its center with the pliers. As you do, angle the syringe’s needle toward the edge of the bubble. Push the needle farther in as needed in order to reach the edge. Then push down on the syringe’s plunger to line the subfloor with glue along the bubble’s edge. Rotate the syringe as you work in order to apply a circular line of glue., Continue applying glue in the same fashion. As you do, start drawing the needle out of the carpet. Create concentric circles of glue underneath the carpet spiraling in toward the center of the bubble., Once you have drawn the needle all the way out, set the syringe aside. Starting from the center of the bubble, use your hands to push the edge into the subfloor. Ensure the glue makes contact with the carpet’s underside while spreading it out at the same time for wider contact. From there, continue outward toward the bubble’s edges., Use a rolling pin to smooth the carpet even further once you’ve finished pressing the bubble down into place with your hands. Then set weights over the area to keep the glue in contact with the carpet until it sets. Check the glue’s instructions regarding drying times. Leave the weights in place for at least that long.

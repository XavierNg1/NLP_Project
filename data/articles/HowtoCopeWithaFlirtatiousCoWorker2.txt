 Flirting back may seem like a good way to ease the tension, but it will only make matters worse. End the flirtation with your actions. If the worker makes a comment or inappropriate joke, do not laugh it off. Change the subject to something work related.If your coworker touches you or gets too close to you, move away and create space before you talk to them.
You may have to take action several times before your coworker starts to get the point.
 A coworker is probably more likely to flirt with you in a one-on-one situation than in a group. Turn down any invitations to go get coffee or lunch. If you are invited, ask another coworker to go with you.

If the flirty coworker wants to meet during lunch time, suggest another time to meet.
If a one-on-one meeting is necessary, leave the door open or make sure other people are in the area.
 Having only work-related discussions with a flirty coworker demonstrates that you only want to have a professional relationship. When asked about your personal life, state that you do not discuss personal issues at work and then redirect the conversation to something work related. This is a way to correct your coworker without being rude or damaging your work relationship. After a few exchanges, your coworker should understand.If your coworker asks you something about your personal life, say "I try not to discuss my personal life at work. But I would like to hear more about (some work related issue)."
Be sure to move the conversation to something about work. This will prevent an awkward silence or seem like you are making a big deal.

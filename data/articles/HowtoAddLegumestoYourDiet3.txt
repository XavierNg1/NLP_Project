 Most legumes need to be soaked before they are used for cooking or eating. Pick out any shriveled or inedible beans and then place the remaining beans in a large bowl. Use 1 lb (0.45 kg) of dried legumes and add 10  c (2,400 mL) of water. Cover the bowl and refrigerate it for at least four hours.If you’re in a hurry, you can soak the legumes more quickly by bringing the water to boil in a pot, then adding it to the legumes. Cover the bowl and let the legumes soak for one to four hours.
Remember that black-eyed peas and lentils don’t need to be soaked before cooking. Canned varieties of legumes don’t require soaking either.
 Regardless of what type of legume you are using, you should rinse them thoroughly before eating or cooking. Place the legumes in a large bowl in the kitchen sink and rinse them by hand. Be sure to run your fingers over the surface of the legumes to work away any grime that might be present.Let the legumes dry before adding directly to any food items.
 Remember that cooking legumes changes the size of the food item in the process. So, 1  c (240 mL) of dried beans is not the same as 1  c (240 mL) of cooked beans. In general, 1 lb (0.45 kg) of dried legumes yields approximately 5  c (1,200 mL) of cooked legumes.A typical 15.5-ounce can of legumes yields about 1.3  c (310 mL)of drained/cooked legumes.

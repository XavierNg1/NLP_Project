 Netting that is too small for starlings to penetrate will prevent them from entering your orchard while still allowing sunlight and less invasive birds through.


The practicality of this approach may vary depending on the size of the area that you wish to cover.
Maintaining the netting is importantâ€”holes may allow the starlings to get through.
The areas may need to be covered only for a limited time. Once the starlings move on to a new area, they may not try to return, or you may be able to continue prevention with less extreme measures.
 Starlings prefer to nest in areas where the trees are dense and close together. For a long-term solution to deter the birds, consider thinning the trees on your property.
 Sometimes thick or commercial grade material such as metal flashing or industrial vent/chimney covers may be necessary., Metal spikes along ledges and other areas that starlings have started to roost will help drive starlings away to other areas., Boards or other materials set at a 45 degree incline along ledges and other roost areas will deter starlings due to the uncomfortable angle.You may be able to remove the boards once the starlings have moved on to new territory.

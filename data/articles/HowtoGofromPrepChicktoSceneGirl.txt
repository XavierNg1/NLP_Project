 Listen to music such as punk rock, alternative, rap, techno, and crunkcore. Scene style isn't about following the mainstream, so try searching around MySpace and finding new and undiscovered bands.;
, Use cute little kid words that people normally wouldn't say. And do not forget to overuse them. Also, *do not* copy someone else's words.
 Black eyeliner and bright colored eyeshadow is the way to go.


Note: Do not go from wearing natural tones one day to totally punked out eye makeup the next. This will cause people to notice, and it will seem like you are trying way too hard. Start with more mascara than usual, then slightly more eyeliner, and go from there.
 Band T-shirts and bright coloured random shirts --from stores such as American Apparel, Forever 21, Urban Outfitters and Delias-- are always in style. Make sure you always wear skinny jeans.


You are going to need super bright accessories and necklaces.






Buy bright coloured ballet flats and/or Vans.(converse work too)







, The sites that scenes are interested in are Myspace & Facebook. They are what you need to get noticed and make friends. Also there's this scene site called (Sceneteens.ning.com)that's starting to get more popular so you need to check that out too.
 If necessary, wait longer than 6 weeks for this change. Remember, your hair needs to be original, colourful, and preferably do-it-yourself.


The scene hair cut is, short choppy layers cut at the crown of your head. Part your hair from temple to temple and cut the top layer until it reaches your cheekbones, then cut into it to make it choppy.

Sunday evening is the absolute highest time of bidding activity on eBay. Maximize your auction by planning it to end at about 11 pm eastern standard time on Sunday.
Friday and Saturday. Friday before 6pm can be a good day for your younger person and student market. However, weekend days are usually better than weekdays.
Monday and Thursday. Monday's are fair because a lot of people surf the net (and especially eBay) during work to help with "after weekend withdrawals". Thursdays are ok times to end your eBay auctions in the spring and summer because many people will cast their bids before they leave for weekend trips.;
,


Wednesday. For whatever reason, Wednesdays are one of the worst days to launch your eBay auction
Tuesday. Tuesdays receive the lowest number of bids out of all the days of the week.

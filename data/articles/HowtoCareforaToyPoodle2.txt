 Poodles have a curly wiry coat that grows continually. Poodles do not shed hair in the same way as other breeds. Their hair does fall out, but it gets tangled with the rest of the coat. This means poodles are very liable to getting knots and tangles.Puppies have a soft coat, which starts to be replaced by adult fur from about 6-9 months of age. A full changeover to the adult coat can take until the pet is 18 months old.
 Take a few minutes every day to groom your dog. This will serve a dual purpose: you will be able to detangle his hair and you will be giving him some much-needed attention.
 To comb through the snags, use a comb or brush that is available at a pet store. You may also want to use both, using a comb on certain parts of the dog's body and a brush on other parts.
 Before you start combing, spray your toy poodle’s coat with a light mist of water. This will help avoid static build-up. It can also help prevent dry hair from snagging together.
 Separate off a section of coat and hold it between your fingers. Comb the coat by brushing from root to tip.


Groom the entire coat and be sure to comb behind the ears and under the tummy.
 A toy poodle’s hair grows all the time, so keeping it tidy requires clipping. Depending on how long or short you’d like to keep your dog’s coat, aim to get the hair clipped every 3-8 weeks.


This is usually done at a dog grooming parlor, but with access to good dog clippers, some practice, and plenty of time, you can learn to clip a dog yourself.

 A basic vinaigrette is a mix of acid and fat. For example, one part vinegar or lemon juice, and three to four parts olive oil. To make a fruit vinaigrette, thaw some frozen fruit and puree it in a blender. Then add the mixture to your chosen acidic liquid. For pulpier fruits or ones with seeds, you may want to strain the puree before putting it into the sauce.Try raspberries, blackberries, or strawberries for a vinaigrette that pairs well with any type of lettuce.;
, Similar to a vinaigrette, most marinades will require you to puree the frozen fruit before you add it. However, you can add the fruit to any marinade you like. A fruitier sauce pairs especially well with chicken or pork. Try mixing the fruit puree with olive oil, lemon or lime juice, Dijon Mustard, and an herb like basil.Blackberries and raspberries work well for a little added sweetness.
 Place a cup of frozen fruit into a small saucepan with a little bit of orange juice or water and cornstarch. Turn up the heat until the mixture begins to bubble, then turn it down to a simmer. Stir the sauce continuously until it thickens. If using water, try adding a Â½ cup of sugar to make it sweeter. You can also wait for the sugar water to thicken before adding fruit at the end and mixing it.Blueberries are the most common for fruit syrups. However, try blackberries, cherries, and raspberries as well.
 For a subtle fruity flavor that can smooth out the intensity of spicier sauces, try adding some frozen fruit to your standard BBQ sauce. Simmer the fruit with a little bit of ketchup, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, and cumin. Once it starts to boil, reduce the heat and stir until it reaches a thicker, typical barbecue sauce texture.Try using frozen pineapple, mango, or a mix of berries.

 If parts of the drywall are sticking out from when the nail was removed, gently scrape them off or push them into the hole. Make sure the edges of the hole are flush with the wall, so there won't be any bumps or lumps after you repair the area., Load the joint knife with joint compound and push the compound into the hole. Scrape away the excess compound by holding the knife at a ninety-degree angle from the wall and running it over the surface of the hole.Try not to get joint compound on the wall surrounding the hole, since it will dry and affect the paint in the area. Load the knife with only as much compound as you need to fill the hole.
If you get joint compound on the wall area surrounding the nail as you work, wipe it away with a damp cloth.
 Use fine-grit sandpaper to sand the area once the compound has completely dried. Use a damp cloth to wipe away the dust when you're finished. The wall surface where the hole was should now be completely smooth.
 For a perfectly seamless repair, use a soft cloth to dab a bit of primer over the repaired area. When it's dry, use another cloth to dab wall paint over the area.

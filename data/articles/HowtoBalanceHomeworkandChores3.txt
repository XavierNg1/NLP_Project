 When you exercise, our body feels good, and you end up in a better mental state. Also, you’ll have more energy for the more physical chores like picking weeds, raking leaves, or mowing the lawn, which will allow you to do it faster and more efficiently.


Exercising can also be a hobby, like a sport that you enjoy. As long as you are getting out there and moving, it’s better than sitting around!
Gym isn’t enough exercise for most people. Make sure that you take up another physical hobby like basketball, hockey, martial arts, tennis, dance, or something else that’s challenging.

You may think that you’re working hard and getting through all of your chores and homework but the reality is because your mind is dull from being overworked, you’re completing these tasks slower than normal.


Going outside and taking a 10 minute walk to get fresh air is a great thing to do when you take a break.
 Your nutrition affects how well you can do physical and mental tasks. If you are taking too long on homework or chores, it might be because of your diet. The better nutrition you get, the more energy you’ll be able to have to finish chores and homework early and have time to hang out with your friends.
 A lack of sleep limits your cognitive function-the thing you use to do your homework! If you aren’t getting enough sleep at night, try to get to bed earlier because it could be preventing you from doing your homework quickly, and may even be increasing the time it takes you on more physical chores.


If you are between the ages of 14 to 17 you'll need around 8 to 10 hours of sleep to feel fully rested. If you are over 17 you'll need at least 7 to 9 hours of sleep to feel good.

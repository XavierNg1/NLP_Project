 Instead of using money and donuts to gain levels, do it the other way around! Level up quicker by doing tasks and helping neighbors. Every time you level, you'll get some donuts and other benefits.


Unlocking secrets and finishing tasks also give you money to spend. Use them wisely!

, If all else fails and you really have to spend money, your real money, then which one is better donuts? or cash? The answer to that question is donuts.


You can get cash by doing anything, tasks, leveling, selling, etc., but you can only get donuts every time you level. In addition, you can use donuts to speed up actions and gain more cash AND EXP.

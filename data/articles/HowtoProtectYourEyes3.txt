 Proximity to a TV screen will not cause long-term damage to your eyes, but prolonged viewing of television can still be harmful. Watching a lot of TV (more than four hours a day) can cause eye strain and fatigue, which in turn can cause blurred vision. Exposure to TV should be limited, particularly for young children.Sitting too close to the TV may be an indicator, and not a cause, of vision problems in children.
 It is important to protect your eyes from eye strain when at the computer, particularly if your job requires you to be looking at a computer screen for the bulk of the day. If possible, upgrade your computer screen to an LCD model, which is easier on the eyes than older models. Adjust your computer display settings to reduce eye strain â€“ adjust the brightness to match the brightness of your surrounding work area, and adjust text size to make reading more comfortable. Look up from your screen or get up from your desk as often as possible to give your eyes a break. , Always make sure to read in good lighting; reading in dim lighting can cause eye strain over time. Purchase a reading lamp or gooseneck lamp to better adjust your lighting when reading. Be sure to take frequent breaks to rest your eyes.

 Try to find other Clique role players and comment on their posts. Make your comments nice and detailed, so the author of the blog knows that you are genuinely interested in their posts and aren't just begging for viewers. No need to ask for a view, everyone will click on your name and view your blog.
 This will help you talk to and meet other bloggers. You will probably be added into a group chat and will be introduced to other bloggers. Never be a drama queen on AIM.
 Many "big" bloggers hold contest throughout the year. The winners and runners-up usually get a lot of shout outs and lots of praise, as well as several other prizes. This will attract people to your blog and make you more well-known.
 If people know you are dedicated, they won't be able to resist reading your dramatic and filthy-rich posts. Do not spam people, that way, they will anticipate your posts, and will enjoy them more.
 After all, that's what people LOVE about the Clique. People also love the Clique series because of how rich and luxurious the life of The Pretty Committee is. Be sure to emphasize that!

,, Make your targets public (e.g. mention it at the end of each post) and ask bloggers to help you reach your target.
 No one will like your blog if all you want is viewers. You have to truly care about your blog.

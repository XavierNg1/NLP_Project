 Train your dog to avoid other dogs, unless you say it is ok to initiate interaction. Teaching your dog how to be indifferent to another dog, especially if it is aggressive, will decrease the chances of an aggressive interaction.


When encountering another dog and its owner, keep your eyes forward, and do not look at the other owner or their dog. Keep walking at a natural pace. Reward your dog with a treat if they show indifference to the other dog.If your dog begins staring, obsessing, or interacting with the other dog without your permission, tell your dog to “Sit” and refocus its attention on you. Once your dog sits and the other dog has passed along. Give your dog a treat for obeying.
 Training your dog to sit, stay, and get up when told is an effective way to calm and reassure your dog. At home, practice telling your dog to sit. Every time he sits, give him a reward, like a treat. Also, practice telling him commands like “Yes” or “Ok,” so it knows that your are the final authority on when to get up.Training your dog reassures your dog that, if it encounters a negative situation, you will handle it for him. This prevents your dog from feeling like it needs to defend itself. If your dog feels as if you cannot protect it, any sign of aggression from another dog will provoke aggression in your dog.
 Prevent your dog from getting overexcited at the sight of another dog by keeping greetings between your dog and other dogs brief and positive. While your dog is saying, "Hello," to another dog, keep the interaction brief by positively interrupting your dog to refocus its attention on you.Once your dog has met a dog, interrupt it and regain your dog’s focus for a few seconds. A positive, interruptive command could be something like, “Hey, hey” or “Come on.” Gently tug your dog’s leash to move him away. Reward your dog’s good behavior.

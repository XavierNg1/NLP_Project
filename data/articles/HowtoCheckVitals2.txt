 To read a person's pulse, place your index and middle fingers on the person's radial artery. This artery is on the inside of the wrist, closest to the thumb. When pressing, you should be able to feel the heartbeat using a firm but light pressure. Pressing to hard may only complicate your reading. Count the number of heartbeats in 30 seconds and multiply by two for beats per minute.You can also count the beats over 60 seconds, if you prefer.
 Instead of feeling for a pulse, you can also listen with a stethoscope to the heartbeat, still counting the beats in 30 seconds. Each "lub-dub" of the heart counts for a single beat, not two. In addition, blood pressure machines also read pulse, and most clinics and hospitals also have a finger monitor that can check pulse rates.

For a typical adult, the pulse should be between 60 and 80 beats per minute., To check for the respiratory rate, count the number of times a person breathes in a minute. One full cycle of inhaling and exhaling counts as a single breath. If you're doing it on someone else, you can simply watch how many times their chest rises and count.Normal respiration is generally 12 to 16 breaths per minute for an adult.
 If you come upon a person in a emergency, you'll need to check to see if the person is breathing and if they have a heartbeat. To check for breathing, watch the person's chest, listen close to the person's mouth, and feel their chest to see if they are breathing. To check for a pulse, place your index finger and middle finger on their carotid artery, which is in the middle of the neck between the neck muscle and windpipe. Hold your fingers there to see if you feel a pulse.If the person isn't breathing or doesn't have a heartbeat, you'll need to begin CPR. If the person isn't breathing and they're on their back, first try to tilt their head back, which may move the tongue out of the way.

 This technique is good if you just need to look a little teary, but you don't necessarily need a waterworks display. As the air dries the surface of your eyes, your eyelids will want to blink to moisten them. Don't let them close. The longer you hold them open, the more tears you'll produce.


Fan your eyes to produce more wind and dry your eyes out faster.
If you're in a dry, dusty area, even better. Your eyes will produce tears to clear the dust away.
Be careful not to let anything dangerous get in your eye. If the wind is whipping sand around, for example, you could cause eye damage.
 If your impulse to blink is unbearably strong, you can hold your eyes open with your fingers. This doesn't exactly look natural, so you probably don't want to use this technique if you're trying to actually fool someone with your fake crying.


Don't hold your eyes open manually for more than a few seconds; again, your eyelids blink to protect your eyes, and you don't want to prevent this reflex from happening to the point where you could cause yourself harm.
Be sure not to touch your eyeball with your fingers; eyes can easily become infected when they come into contact with dirt and bacteria found on hands.
 After you've held your eyes open and let the tears collect a bit, close your eyes to squeeze them out. You should have enough water to produce one or two good-sized drops.

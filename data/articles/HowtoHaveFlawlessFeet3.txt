 If you notice unusual marks on your feet and under your toenails that do not go away with at home treatments, see a dermatologist. In rare cases, such marks can be a sign of a skin cancer known as melanoma.


Melanoma usually occurs in areas of the body heavily exposed to the sun. However, it has been known to appeal under toenails and on the soles of feet. Check these areas on the regular basis for any new moles or unusual changes to the skin.Melanoma usually starts as a normal mole and then changes and becomes cancerous. Moles that are asymmetrical, have irregular or scalloped borders, change in color over time, are larger than 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) in diameter, or evolve in color, shape, and size may be a sign of melanoma. If you notice any such moles on your feet, make an appointment with a dermatologist for evaluation., As stated, feet are exposed to a lot of damage throughout the day. Make regular appointments with a pedicurist for deeper exfoliation and skin renewal treatments. Regular pedicures can help you maintain healthy, attractive feet.
 Toenail fungus is marked by brittle, thick, misshapen, and yellowish toenails. If you believe you have foot fungus, see a doctor for evaluation and treatment.Your doctor will likely prescribe a round or oral antifungal drugs to treat nail fungus. You usually take these drugs from 6 to 12 weeks. Take any medication your doctor prescribes as directed. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for guidance if you have any questions about the medication. Medicated nail polish or nail cream may be prescribed alongside medication depending on the severity of the fungus.In rare cases, your doctor may want to surgically remove a nail if fungus is severe. A new nail will grow in its place, but it may take a long time. You might have to wear protective bandages around your foot as the new nail grows.

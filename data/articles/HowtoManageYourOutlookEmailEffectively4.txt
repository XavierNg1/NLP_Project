 Keep unnecessary email messages from the Inbox by using Outlook Junk Email Filter. This filter will send the emails that are flagged as junk emails into a separate folder in the mailbox. The users can view the content of this folder to make sure that there are not any valid emails mistakenly sent to it. If so, you should adjust the filter to avoid the wrong mark on the messages in the future.

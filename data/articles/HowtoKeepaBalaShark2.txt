 To help your bala sharks adjust to their new tank water, they’ll need to be acclimated. Remove ¼ of the their bag water and replace it with an equal amount from the tank. Then place them in the tank while still in their plastic water bags, and add one cup (237 milliliters) of tank water to the bag every ten minutes for one hour. Finally, gently net the fish from the bag, and dispose of the bag and its water., After bringing the fish home and putting them in the tank, you might notice that they are shy at first, and may not eat for a few days. This is normal behavior, because of the fright they experience during the trip from the store to your tank.


Be careful not to overfeed them during this period--try giving them small amounts a few times a day until their appetite improves., Bala Sharks like a variety of foods, including flakes, brine shrimp, mosquito larvae, chopped fruit, blanched spinach, shelled peas,sinking wafers, and live black worms.Generally, give them an even mixture of vegetable matter, flakes, and live food.Try to feed them 2 to 3 times per day. At each feeding, give them as much as they're able to eat in 3 minutes. If you only feed them once a day, give them what they can eat in 5 minutes., To keep your bala sharks in good health, they’ll need regular water changes. Replace 50% of the water at least once a month, and replace 25% at least every other week if the tank is densely populated.


When you replace the water, this is also a good time to clean the bottom of the tank, including rocks, with a vacuum siphon. Use an algae scraper as well to clean the glass panes.

 There are web-based services that allow you to send emails anonymously without creating an email account. Some are more secure than others. AnonEmail at Anonymouse.org distances your message from the source by relaying it several times before it reaches its destination. However, it doesn't allow you to include attachments. 10 Minute Mail creates a disposable email account for you: From the moment you arrive on the site, you have ten minutes to send your anonymous email before the account is erased. Silent Sender allows you to send anonymous messages and check the delivery status of your message.
Make sure the site you choose has a privacy policy or an assurance that it does not keep a log of its users' activities.
 The Tor Browser Bundle is a downloadable service that encrypts your Internet connection and randomizes the sites you visit, making it harder to track your path. , Most of these anonymous email services will have a Terms of Use or FAQ page that you should read before sending your email.


Services will usually include a reminder that they do not accept any liability for your emails.
Keep in mind that despite claims of anonymity, your IP address will still be attached to your email.
 This will generally just be the recipient's email, a subject, and a message.
 Remember again not to drop any clues about your identity.

 Laser printers fuse the ink (technically "toner") to the paper fibers before the paper is ejected, so the ink is already dry and bonded by the time you see it.Acetone, also sold as fingernail polish remover, can be applied with a cotton ball to dissolve some of the ink into a liquid again. This is not a perfect method, but may be the only one easily available. The paper will end up grey and smudged, but new printing or writing should be clearly visible on top of the smudge.


Keep acetone away from heat sources, as it is flammable. If you feel dizzy from fume inhalation, move to fresh air. If you get acetone on your skin, eyes, or mouth, immediately rinse with lukewarm water for 15 minutes, without pausing to remove contact lenses., Rubbing the acetone over the ink greatly increases the amount of ink removed, although about 1/3 of the ink will probably remain as a grey smudge and faint image. Rub tissue paper only once across the affected area, since additional rubbing may tear the paper and does not noticeably increase the amount of ink removed., Ultrasonic devices use high-frequency sound waves to agitate contaminants and break them off of surfaces. This can be used to remove even more of the ink smudge, although the paper will still not appear as new. However, while these machines are sold for household use, they range from $150 at the cheapest, to several thousand dollars for higher-capacity, stronger versions.
 These devices uses short pulses of laser light to burn off laser-printed inks, but as of September 2014, they only exist as theory or prototypes. This may change, however, so search online for news about "unprinters" or about the company "Reduse."These devices will not work on inkjet-printed paper.
 If none of the above methods work, try using whiteout instead. This will leave a visible raised, white surface on the paper, but once dry it will allow you to write or draw over it.

 You need one no wider than one or two inches. A paddle iron will be too wide.
 Spray your hair with a heat protectant. Comb it through thoroughly.
 Start with one side of your head. Gather up the top layers of your hair, leaving just the bottom layer, and pin them back with a butterfly clip. Comb out a one- or two-inch section.
 Start about an inch or two from the roots. Rotate your wrist toward your head, angling the iron down.Slide it an inch or two down at this angle, and rotate your wrist in the other direction, so the iron is angled up. Slide it an inch or two down at this angle, and rotate your wrist again. Repeat until you reach the end of your hair.
 Continue through the rest of your hair, until it is all nice and wavy. Mist it with hairspray to help it keep its shape.

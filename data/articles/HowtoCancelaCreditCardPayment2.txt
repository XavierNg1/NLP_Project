 Say, for example, that you want to cancel a monthly subscription to a premium online music service. Verify the company name and how often you are charged (monthly, in this case). Confirm the date that the charge is posted to your account each month

, In this example, you would access the online music service website. Enter your username and password. See if the site offers an automated option to cancel a recurring payment.


Select the recurring payment that you want to cancel, if an automated system is available. Cancel the payment.
Note that date of the last payment charge to your credit card. You'll need to use that date to verify that no charges are posted after that point in time.
Keep documentation on the cancellation.
Check your future credit card statements to confirm that no charges are posted after the final charge date provided by the vendor.
 Have your account number, charge amount, and the date of the charge with you when you call. Ask the customer service person to email you confirmation that the recurring charge will be cancelled.

Confirm the date of the final charge to your account. Keep the documentation on file.
Use these records to check your credit card statements to ensure that the charges have stopped.
If the vendor refuses to cancel the recurring payment, consider contacting your state Attorney General or the Better Business Bureau.

 Read How to Use Google Alerts if you don't know what to do yet.



 ;
, Here are some of the alerts you might consider running:

Your name






Your phone number






Your address (home and place of work)






Your date of birth (just to be safe)






Your license plate number






Your drivers license number






Your email address







, If any of these alerts are sent to you in a way you think indicates a potential identity theft, take immediate action.

Check the link(s) provided in the Google alerts. Look for anything unusual either within the sites you're sent to, or look for a pattern in general relating to the type of sites you're being alerted to (such as financial institutions, sites that hold security information, etc.)
Be especially alert if the returns with your personal details suddenly spike. You might get an occasional ping with your personal details from Google Alerts but if you notice a sudden increase in the amount of returns reaching your in-box, this is a cause for concern and should be investigated quickly.
 You may need to respond quickly if it appears that fraud may be happening using your personal details. See the Related wikiHows below for further details on preventing and dealing with identity theft online.

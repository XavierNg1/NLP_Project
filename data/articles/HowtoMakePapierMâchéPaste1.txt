 Measure ½ cup of water, and add it to a pot. Turn the heat on high and bring it to a boil


;
, Add ½ cup of flour, ½ cup of cold water, and ¾ teaspoon of salt together to a bowl. Mix these well to create a thin paste.
 Pour the flour mixture into the boiling water and stir, keeping the mixture at a boil for five minutes. Then, turn off the stove and continue stirring until a thick paste forms.
 After a thick paste has formed, leave it to cool on the stove until it is cool to the touch. If you are in a hurry, you can consider letting it set on a cold burner for 15 minutes, and then placing it in the freezer for another 15-20 minutes.
 As soon as your paste has cooled to room temperature, it is ready to use! Apply it to your papier mâché project using a paintbrush for the smoothest coat. Don’t worry about heating it up again unless it is too thick to use. Store any excess in a glass jar and refrigerate.

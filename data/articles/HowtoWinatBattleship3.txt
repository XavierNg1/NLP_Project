 If your battleships are touching, there is a chance that your opponent may sink two ships back to back. To reduce your opponent’s chances of finding a second battleship after hitting one, some players suggest spacing your battleships out so that they do not touch. Try to keep one or two spaces between each of your battleships to reduce the chances of your opponent finding one of your battleships., Even though having your battleships right next to each other is seen as a weakness by some players, other players see this as a potential strategy. By placing two ships so that they are touching, but not overlapping, you may be able to confuse your opponent about the type of ship they have just sunk.Keep in mind that placing ships close together can work in your favor, but it can also be a risky strategy since it may lead to your opponent discovering one or more of your other ships.
 If you play with the same opponent often, another way that you can improve your chances of winning is to place ships where your opponent seldom strikes. Keep a mental record of the spaces your opponent strikes most often and avoid these zones.For example, does your opponent tend to start their strikes on the right side of the board, to the center or in the lower left corner? Identify your opponent’s most common strike areas and avoid placing your ships in these zones.

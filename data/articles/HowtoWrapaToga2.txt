 Find a full, queen or king-sized flat sheet and fold it in half. If you want a longer toga, fold the sheet only a quarter.
 Take one end of your sheet and drape a few feet of it, front to back, over one of your shoulders. The draped end should reach down your back to your butt.
 Holding the long end of the sheet, wrap it diagonally across your chest and under one arm. Continue wrapping across your back, under your other arm and around your chest.
 Tuck the piece youâ€™ve been wrapping (the long end) under the piece you draped over your shoulder.
 Adjust the height of your toga by folding, pinning or bunching the material until it hits your legs where you want it. It may take a few passes until you feel it lays right. Spend some time smoothing the layers and folds and pin them if you need to.

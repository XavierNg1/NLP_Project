 The region enclosed by the circle at the bottom of the cylinder is your bottom base surface (B). A radius is any line segment that runs from a circle’s center to its perimeter. To find the radius, simply measure from the mid-point of the cylinder’s bottom to the outside of the circle.


A diameter is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and has endpoints on the circle’s perimeter. For any circle, the diameter will be twice the radius. Therefore, you can also find the radius of the circle at the bottom of the cylinder by measuring the complete radius and dividing that number in half.
 Once you know the radius of your bottom base surface (B), you can calculate the area. To do so, use the formula B = πr2, using your radius as r and 3.14159 for π, which is a mathematical constant.
 You can now determine the total volume of the tank by multiplying the area by the length of the tank. The full formula for total volume of the tank is Vtank = πr2h.
 The filled volume is just a shorter cylinder with the same radius but a different height: the fill height, d. Therefore: 𝑉 = π𝑟2h.

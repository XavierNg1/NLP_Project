 Cut the wood to size and sand the rough edges.;
, Measure up a piece of paper a few millimeters smaller than the wooden block.
 Draw out your design on the paper in pencil, remembering to keep it simple. Go over your design in pen and cut it out.
 Using the paper as a template, draw around the paper shape onto the foam.
 Trim out your design on the foam sheet and try it for size against the block.
 Key the wood with a knife or sandpaper for a stronger hold.


Put glue from a hot glue gun or contact adhesive onto the foam, right up to the edges. Once it is on, turn the block over and add pressure for a stronger hold.
Remember that you will get a reverse image when printing, so any letters or numbers must be glued down in reverse.
 Varnish right up to the foam to make the wood watertight. Leave to dry overnight.
 The block is now ready for printing. Use fabric paint (following the manufacturer's instructions) to decorate cushions, curtains, laundry bags, or try using the block on walls with emulsion.

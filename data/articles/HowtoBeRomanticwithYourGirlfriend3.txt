 While the two of you are watching a movie or sitting at a table and working, run your fingers through her hair. The light head touching/hair messing-with will put her into a near meditative state and she will feel romantically closer to you., Gently holding her face when you kiss her will take your everyday kiss and turn it into a romantic moment for the two of you. Do this as your good-bye kiss in the morning or when she walks in the door from work., A public display of affection (PDA) can be something as regular as a hand hold or as extravagant as a kiss timed to fireworks. Cuddle up with her unexpectedly and let her melt into you., Get some oil and offer her a back massage to help her relax from a stressful day. Even if you’re not able to give her the best massage she’s ever had, she will love that you’re trying to help her out.

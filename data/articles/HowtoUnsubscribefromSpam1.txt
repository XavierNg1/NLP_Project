 Naturally, you'll use your email address for social networks, bank accounts, and official websites (e.g., work services). However, if you can avoid entering your email on sites you only intend to use once or twice, you'll notice a significant reduction in the number of emails you receive.
 When you receive an email from a service such as LinkedIn, Best Buy, or a blog site, you can usually opt out of future correspondence by opening one of their emails, finding a link or button that says "Unsubscribe", and clicking it.

The "unsubscribe" button may say something like "Click here to stop receiving these emails" or something similar.
After clicking the "unsubscribe" button or link, you will likely be redirected to another webpage to confirm your decision.
 There are times at which you'll need to provide a working email address to a service in order to prove that you're an active Internet user. To avoid receiving spam from other services that may purchase your email address from the original service, you can use an email address separate from your main account.

This doesn't apply to official accounts like Facebook, Google, and so on.
 The process for doing this varies depending on the email provider you're using, but you can typically do so from within the desktop version of the offending email.

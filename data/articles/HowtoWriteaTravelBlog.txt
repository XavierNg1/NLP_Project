Provide accurate facts. Protect the credibility of your travel blog by verifying all facts. Write down directions as you travel to various locations so that you can provide accurate information to readers. Provide the correct spelling of towns, people, restaurants and streets. Call phone numbers and visit website links before publishing to verify accuracy.
 As you travel, write down your impressions. After a memorable dining experience, for example, write down the name of the restaurant, the dish you ordered, its ingredients and the details of the decor and music. Recording this level of detail will be helpful later on, especially if/when blog followers contact you for more information.
, The scent of rare flowers, the beautiful view from a mountain top, the feel of soft towels in a high-end hotel, and the sound of a waterfall are examples of descriptions that help people to connect immediately with a place or experience.


Take pictures. To help people see things with their own eyes, take pictures of all locations about which you wish to write. Local cuisines, landmarks, traditional clothing and scenic locations are possible examples. Take numerous photos, posting the clearest and most vivid pictures.
Videotape events. For example, if you are writing about a popular dance festival, include short video clip of dancers next to a description of the event.
 To infuse your travel blog with voices of other travelers, invite freelance writers to submit blog posts about locations you may not have the opportunity to visit. Introduce the writers in a few sentences before posting their entries.
 Blogs typically allow you to accept or disable comments. Allowing comments is an opportunity to build rapport with readers and answer questions.

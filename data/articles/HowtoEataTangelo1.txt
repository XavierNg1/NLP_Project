 Tangelos have a thin and smooth skin that makes it easy to peel. You can start at the top of the tangelo by digging your fingernail or knife under the skin. Then, slowly begin to peel the layers back until all of the skin has been removed.You donâ€™t have to peel neatly unless you are planning to use the rind for something.;
, Once the skin is off, you can begin to segment the tangelo. The fruit should be naturally sectioned, so all you need to do is peel it apart. The tangelo may have zero or many seeds.The amount of seeds varies depending on how much the tree was pollinated by bees as it was growing.
 You will need to do a couple of preparations if cooking with a tangelo. You will need to remove the seeds before cooking. Wash the rind under cold water if you will be using it.

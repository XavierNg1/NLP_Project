 Locate an area near a wheel that is stuck more than the other wheels. Dig out all the loose snow and as much ice as you can. Make sure to clear a level and solid area for the jack. This area should be under a solid metal part of the car that can support the jack.Most cars have several “jack points” – places that are engineered so you can use a jack there. Look in your owner’s manual to find these points.
 After clearing an area for the jack, place something solid on the ground. This way, your jack will be level when you start to crank it up. If the jack isn’t level, it could fall over and injure you., After you’ve positioned it, start to crank the jack up. Crank it up so the lowest tire is level with the other tires. The bottom of the tire should be level with the snow and ice you’ll need to drive on. Be careful, though, as the jack could slip and injure you.Use gloves.
Stand back while cranking it up.
Verify that the jack is stable.
 Place solid items that your tire can gain traction on in the area below the tire. If you have access to it, fill the hole with sand, gravel, and rocks. If not, you can fill it with blankets, plant material, and woodchips.Compact the area after you’ve filled it. You can do this by patting it with a mallet or some other hard object.
 Once you’ve filled the area under the tire, lower the jack if you need to. Chances are, you won’t need to lower it too much. Once you’ve lowered it, carefully remove the jack. Then, with a little luck, you’ll be able to drive out of the snow.

 Heat the vegetable oil in a non-reactive frying pan or saucepan and saut√© the onions and garlic until soft and slightly brown.
 Add the salt, chili powder, cumin, coriander, molasses and sugar to the pan and stir well to combine. Bring to the boil and cook for three minutes.
 Add the four cans of diced tomatoes to the pan, along with the vinegar. Stir well, and bring the contents of the saucepan back to the boil.
 Reduce the heat to low, then leave to simmer, uncovered for two to three hours. The barbecue sauce should become thicker and darker as it simmers.
 Remove the pan from the heat and add in the white vinegar and the Worcestershire sauce. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
 Pour the chunky barbecue sauce into a blender or food processor, add at least two cups of water (or more, depending on the desired consistency) and blend until smooth. You can use your homemade barbecue sauce immediately, or store in a glass jar in the refrigerator.

 Soak a cotton ball or pad with nail polish remover. Rub the soaked cotton ball over the old nail polish gently to remove the polish.
 After applying a clear base coat apply a thin coat of pink or red polish starting at the base of the nail and working your way up.
 Allow your nails to dry for about 10 minutes or until the polish is not wet anymore.
 Carefully paint the watermelon rind on the tip of your nails. If you don't have a thin brush meant for this you can use a tooth pick or tape.
 Rest your nails on a flat and avoid moving your hands as this will smudge the polish.
 Use a black nail pen to create tiny dots to resemble the seeds of a watermelon. (or a tooth pick or a bobby pin dipped into the black regular nail polish.) Try not to form bubbles with the polish as bubbles take longer to dry and are easier to smudge.
 Dry your nails for a couple minutes to continue the design.
 Put a thin clear coat of nail polish to have longer lasting nails.

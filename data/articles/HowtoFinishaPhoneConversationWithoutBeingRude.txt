When you begin a phone conversation with someone likely to keep you on too long, set a limit. "I can only talk for 15 minutes."
When you get close to the end of the conversation, give a small warning, "I only have 3 more minutes."
When you have reached the end of the conversation, respectfully excuse yourself and hang up, by saying something along the lines of "Sorry, but I gotta go. See you later."

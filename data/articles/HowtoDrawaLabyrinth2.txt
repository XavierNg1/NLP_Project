 (Concentric circles sit one inside the other, like a target in a game of darts.)


To make things as easy as possible, label the circles from 1-8, starting with the largest circle as number 1. (There will be references to numbered circles later in the instructions, so even if you decide not to physically label your circles, at least know which would be 1, which would be 2, etc.)

, This is the center of most labyrinths.


Your flower should be perfectly symmetrical--i.e., drawing a straight line through its center in any direction should yield two identical halves. If this is not the case initially, try to redo your flower so that it is.
 The lines should align with the middle of the labyrinth. The lines should be spaced evenly apart.
 Starting with the left horizontal line, erase lines in circles 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7. Erase a part of circle 4, as shown here.


When erasing, remember to make the pathway's size equal to the size of the spaces within circles.
 Erase parts of circles 3, 5, and 7.
 Erase parts of circles 2, 4, and 6.
 Leave the second vertical line untouched. Erase the third vertical line from the left within circle 7, leaving the rest untouched.



For circle 1, erase the part between the first and second vertical lines.
For circles 2 and 6, erase the part between the first and third vertical lines, as well as some from the left.
For circles 3, 5, and 7, erase the part between the first and third vertical line, as well as some from the right.
For circle 4, erase the part between the second and third vertical line.
For circle 8, erase the part between the second and third vertical line.

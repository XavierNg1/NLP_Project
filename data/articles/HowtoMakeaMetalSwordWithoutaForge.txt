 Using a permanent marker, outline the shape of your sword (blade and handle). Make a creative and unique design.;
, If you have a plasma cutter or cutting torch, cut out the shape first - or use a drill press to cut the part out and make it easier to grind down to the shape you want it to be, then roughly sharpen it.
Â Use the fine grit knife sharpener to develop the sharpest edge possible.
 Next, cut it in half. Drill holes through the wood and metal handle. Put a nail through it and cut it where it sticks out about half of a centimeter then hit it with something like a punch on the end of the nail to flatten out the part that is sticking out, this secures the wooden handle.

 This product, also sold as "concrete cleaner," is essentially a powerful soap available from concrete distribution outlets. It tends not to work well on non-porous concrete, or on heavily stained areas. Here's how to apply it:Dilute with water according to label (Skip this for heavy stains.)

Apply over the stain.
Scrub hard for several minutes.
Leave it for several hours.
Blot the residue with rags, or lift it with an industrial wet vac.
 One of the newest ways to deal with oil is to break it down with an enzyme or microbe. These can be very effective if you can find one formulated for your specific oil product. Look in hardware and home improvement stores, or online janitorial supply stores. To clean up the stain, just pour the cleaner onto the oil and let sit for several days or weeks.You can try a general-purpose enzymatic degreaser, but for best results find a product that mentions your specific oil (such as motor oil) on the label.
Check the label for instructions. Some products require water or scrubbing, but most do the work on their own.
There may or may not be residue left over once the product has done its work. If there is residue, check the label for disposal instructions. This residue is typically harmless, and can be washed away to the soil or storm drain.

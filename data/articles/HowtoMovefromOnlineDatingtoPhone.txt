 There is no reason for you to start sharing too much information about yourself in an email. When you meet someone for the first time offline - in a bar, church, party - your conversation would be very general. No secret sharing. No therapy sessions. So use that principle when writing emails to a potential date.;
, Answering emails too quickly will give your potential date the impression that you have nothing else to do. It will also make it easier for the conversation to start turning into countless email banters. On the other hand, answering emails after one week will make the other person lose interest. So be excited when you get a response to your email, but wait a little bit (one or two days) before you click the 'reply' button.
 The only way you can move conversation from email to phone is to offer your date your phone number.
 Someone has to dial the other person's number for this to work. And if you're the one who wants to move away from emails already, call them . Of course, it is courteous to send a brief text SMS asking them if it's a good time - or when is a good time - to call. But when you get the go-ahead, call them.
 It doesn't matter how long the first phone call last. You can play by ear and if you feel that there's some kind of connection, suggest few places to meet for a 'short coffee or drinks'. After all, you don't want to be stuck in endless phone conversations either.

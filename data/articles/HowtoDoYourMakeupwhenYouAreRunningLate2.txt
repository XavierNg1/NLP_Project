 It's easy to slip up and smudge your makeup when you're running late. Instead of removing smudged lipstick, mascara, or eyeliner, dab on some concealer and work it into your skin. This will cover smudges more quickly than redoing your makeup., Eyeliner can take a considerable amount of time to apply. When applying mascara, wiggle the mascara brush against your eyelid. This should leave you with a line running above your lash line. In a pinch, this helps you avoid taking extra time to apply eyeliner.After you're done applying mascara, you can use an angled brush to smooth out your line.
 Instead of contouring in two steps, cut the process down to a single step by using a wide brush. Swipe a wide brush over dark and light contour powder. Then, swipe your brush alone your cheekbones. This will create the dark and light contour tones in one sweep rather than two.This works best if you have a two-toned contour palette. You can also use two different tones of foundation.
 Mascara clumps easily when applied fast. If your mascara ends up clumped, take out a clean toothbrush. Run it through your eyelashes to de-clump mascara, leaving you with spaced out eyelashes.Only use an unused toothbrush. Getting bacteria in your eyes from a used toothbrush is dangerous.

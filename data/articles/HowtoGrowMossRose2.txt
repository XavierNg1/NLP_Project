 Moss Rose is very easy to root from cuttings. However, you should assume a failure rate of about 2/3, so take about three times more plants than you require (though you may have much better success than this!).


Moss Roses can be grown from cuttings every year. This means that after the first time you plant Moss Roses, you will not have to buy these plants again, you can simply take cuttings from the plants you are already growing.
 Take four to five inch sections of healthy growth, strip the lower foliage, and insert about an inch of this cutting into the soil.


Press the soil gently around the cutting to help your Moss Rose cutting grow roots, or ‘root’, more quickly.
 If you can, root your cuttings outside, as they grow well with direct sunlight. However, if you do this, don’t forget to water your cuttings regularly until they become established.


Water your cuttings regularly until they take root. Once they are established, however, you can water them less. Wait until the ground around your cuttings feels dry in the top two inches of soil.
 You can also get cuttings to grow roots in a glass of water. Once they have grown their roots, move them to the site where you hope to grow them in your garden.

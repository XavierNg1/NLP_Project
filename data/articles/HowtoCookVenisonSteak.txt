 You need to choose the best quality venison available to you. Like any other meat, venison's final taste is highly dependent on its origin. Ask questions when shopping around and, if the only produce available comes from a supermarket, surely go for the organic variety of it.


Try to get something of about half an inch thick regardless of the overall size.;
, The marinade is essential when it comes to game. Think about countries or regions of the world when it comes to spices and flavours.


For example, to give it a traditional flair, use about a tablespoon each of shallots, garlic and a very high quality raspberry vinegar together with not-so-cheap olive oil.
Cut the shallots and the garlic as small as possible (Brunoise). Put them in a vinaigrette of olive oil and raspberry vinegar, with a generous pinch of salt and pepper.
 Then rub the mixture on the meat. The rubbing in process is not-negotiable!

, Let the meat 'soak' in the flavours for about an hour and you are ready to go.
 Most people are somehow afraid of eating reddish meat. Don't be scared off by red juices. There is some real chemistry going on in the mouth when you taste the juices. Take advantage of it.
 Seriously, make it smoke!

, What you want is black lines that sear the meat and concentrate flavour.


Note: If your marinade is oily enough, your steaks will not stick to the pan.
 Then remove it from the heat.
 If you don't, your meat will resemble shoe's soles. The resting period is essential, so please do not ignore it.


If your searing process was done correctly, when cutting your steak you should have a maximum of 1 mm thick browned meat on each side of the steak. The in-between should be furiously red.
 Salad for summer and steamed potatoes for winter are both excellent sides for your steaks.

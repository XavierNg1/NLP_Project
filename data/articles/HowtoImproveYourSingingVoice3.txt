 A singer needs to take good care of his or her voice by also taking care of the entire body. Eat a balanced diet and get enough sleep every night to boost your immune system.Don’t let health issues or sickness affect your voice.
 This will help to increase your lung capacity and stamina. Having good lung capacity will help you during performances, especially if you are moving around on stage or dancing while singing.
 Drink room temperature water throughout the day. Avoid cold water as it can have a numbing effect on your throat and make it more difficult to use your vocal chords.
 Cigarette smoke can dry out your lungs and vocal folds. This will make breathing during singing more difficult and lessen your vocal quality.You should also avoid dairy products. They can create mucus in your throat that can muffle your voice.
If possible, avoid taking medications that have a drying effect on your throat or that might irritate your throat.
 Pain is almost always a sign of an unhealthy singing technique. The old adage “no pain, no gain” does not apply to singing.Pain and discomfort can be anything from hoarseness, unsteadiness, an inability to sing at a softer volume, and a voice that cuts out. If you feel pain or experience any of these symptoms, rest your voice, and consult a throat specialist.
Once your voice has recovered, adjust your vocal techniques so you do not damage your voice again.

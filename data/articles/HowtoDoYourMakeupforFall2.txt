 Try a flattering color all over your lid. Apply the eyeshadow color according to your eye color:


To Blue Eyes: try a pale pink or pale gray color.
To Grey Eyes: try a pale purple or moss color.
To Brown Eyes: try a moss or other green (not to dark).
To Green Eyes: try a pink or purple color.
 Take a plain-jane clear gloss and sweep that on your lips.
 Take a plain foundation and sweep that on. This gives a natural look.

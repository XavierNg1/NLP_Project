 A climbing post usually has a least two to three shelves or resting spots, like branches of a tree. Most cats enjoy climbing and resting on a climbing post. Some climbing posts also double as scratching posts and are made of material that can be scratched or pawed by your cat.You can find climbing posts for your cat online or at your local pet store.
If you have more than one cat, you may want to invest in more than one climbing post. This way, your cats will not need to fight over the same post and can have equal access to high resting places.
 To ensure your cat uses the climbing post for resting, place it in a spot in your home where your cat hangs out. This could be the living room by a window or in a spare room.If you have a large home, you may get more than one climbing post and place them throughout your house. This way, your cat can have access to resting spots in several rooms in your home.
 Encourage your cat to hang out and rest on the climbing post by giving verbal praise and heavy pets when it is on the post. If you notice your cat on the climbing post, go over and give it a few good pets or verbal praise like, “Good kitty” or “That’s a good cat.”Put cat toys on the post so your cat can play with the toys when it wants to. This can encourage your cat to hang out on the climbing post for playing and for resting.

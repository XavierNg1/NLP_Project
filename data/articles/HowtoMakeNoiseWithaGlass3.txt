 The shape of the bottle, as well as the amount of liquid in the bottle, will affect the type of sound produced. Feel free to take a few sips, as the sound of the bottle when first uncapped will be very tinny, as it is nearly full.


If you have a tuning device with a microphone, you can determine the amount of liquid needed in the bottle to produce particular notes.
A tuning fork can also help determine pitch, if you have an ear for sound. Tuning forks typically come in the notes of E, A, and C, and will be labeled according to their frequency., Produce a thin, concentrated breath. You want the air to travel horizontally across the top of the rim, rather than directly inside of the bottle. You should hear a hollow sounding, dull whistle.On a windy day, set your beer bottle on a table. The wind will glide across the bottle, producing the type of sound you are looking to emulate.
As you drink from the bottle (or fill it up), use a marker to note how much liquid is needed for particular notes. You can then use this bottle to gauge how to fill up other bottles to create harmonious notes., You want to make different sounds, don’t you? Alternatively, you can uncap several beers and drink them in varying amounts to create a few different pitches to choose from.Grab a few old bottles from the recycling bin and fill them water, if you don’t feel like drinking copious amounts of beer (or are not of age).
Cookouts or house parties are perfect opportunities to gather a group of bottles together for creating music.

 When you sit, the fabric of your pants naturally bunches up around your groin, making it harder for others to tell the bulge of an erection from a crease in your jeans. Sitting also allows you to obscure your groin with your legs. Pulling your legs together or crossing your legs makes an erection even harder to see. This tactic should give you time to let your erection shrink naturally.Sitting down also gives you more options for concealing your erection. If you're sitting at a table or a desk, for instance, you can pull your chair closer to cover your crotch. You can fold your hands in your lap.
 If your erection won't go away, try to buy time by subtly holding something in front of your groin. Try covering your lap with a book, a laptop, or a newspaper. If you're standing, try holding a bag, backpack, briefcase, coat, or newspaper about waist-high.Whatever you choose, be subtle. Hold the cover-up object as if everything is normal. Otherwise, you may simply draw added attention to the area you're trying to conceal.
 If your erection won't go away, try to quickly and discreetly adjust it by hand. Tuck the rigid shaft up into the waistband of your pants or underwear. This aligns your penis with the zipper or seam of your pants and makes an erection less noticeable.Use caution when wearing a tucked-in shirt or a shirt that doesn't reach all the way down to your waist. If your shirt rides up, you might accidentally expose yourself!
Be aware that while this technique will help hide your erection, the friction of the fabric may also inadvertently arouse you further.
Some people prefer tucking downward against one of the thighs. It is really just a question of personal preference and comfort.

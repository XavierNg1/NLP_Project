 You can also use a boot disk or LiveCD. This will allow you to boot to this disk instead of the hard drive, which will allow you to format it.
 You will need to set your boot order in the BIOS in order to boot from the disc. See this guide for details on setting your boot order.


To open your BIOS, reboot your computer and press the setup key. this is usually F2, F10, or Del.
 You will need to start the installer and navigate past the first few pages until you reach the screen with a list of your installed drives. You will be initiating a Custom Installation of Windows.
 You will see a list of all your drives and the partitions they contain. Select the drive you want to format, and then click the "Format" button at the bottom of the list. The drive will be formatted as NTFS.


You can only format your boot drive as NTFS.
 Now that the drive has been formatted, you can reinstall Windows, or install Linux on it. You will need an operating system on your computer in order to use it.

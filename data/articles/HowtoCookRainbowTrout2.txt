 Spread mixture out evenly on a dinner plate.
 Place fish onto the flour mixture to coat both sides.
 Remove from heat and use a spoon to skim off and discard of the foam, leaving the rest of the butter in the pan.
 Place trout skin-side down into the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes until the bottom is browned. Use a spatula to flip fish over, reduce the heat to medium, and allow the other side to cook for 2-4 minutes.
 Shake the pan often and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the capers open up.
 Garnish with lemon wedges and parsley, if desired.


Enjoy!

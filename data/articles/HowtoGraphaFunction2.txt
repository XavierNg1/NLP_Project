 Get the function of the form like f(x), where y would represent the range, x would represent the domain, and f would represent the function. As an example, we'll use y = x+2, where f(x) = x+2.
 The horizontal line is your x axis. The vertical line is your y axis.
 Mark both the x axis and the y axis with equally-spaced numbers. For the x axis, the numbers are positive on the right side and negative on the left side. For the y axis, the numbers are positive on the upper side and negative on the lower side.
 Take your function f(x) = x+2. Calculate a few values for y by putting the corresponding values for x visible on the axis into the function. For more complicated equations, you may want to simplify the function by getting one variable isolated first.


-1: -1 + 2 = 1


0: 0 +2 = 2


1: 1 + 2  = 3


, Simply sketch imaginary lines vertically for each x axis value and horizontally for each y axis value. The point where these lines intersect is a graph point.
 Once you have drawn all the graph points, you can erase the imaginary lines. Note: the graph of f(x) = x would be a line parallel to this one passing through the origin (0,0), but f(x) = x+2 is shifted two units up (along the y-axis) on the grid because of the +2 in the equation.

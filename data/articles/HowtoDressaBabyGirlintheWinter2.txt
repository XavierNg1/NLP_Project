 Choose a nice, warm coat with a hood. This will help to keep your girl’s head warm, even if a cold wind picks up.


Jackets that are lined with fleece are good for extra cold locations.
 Once your child is mobile and wants to play outside in the extreme cold, put her in a warm snowsuit with warm lining, such as fleece or cotton. Pick a snowsuit out that you baby girl will love; consider letting her pick it out, so that she will be more inclined to put it on when it is time to play outside.


Mobile babies should also wear waterproof snow boots and thick socks to keep their feet warm and comfortable.
Young babies and infants who can’t walk or crawl don’t need snowsuits, as they can wear thick layers instead. Babies who can’t crawl or walk will be fine wearing thick socks and no shoes.
 Accessories are incredibly important in keeping your baby girl warm, especially when you go outside. When it is snowing, windy, or very cold, be sure to cover her head with a hat that pulls over her ears and cover her hands with mittens.


Some baby sweaters and coats come with sleeves stay on your baby’s hands like mittens.
 If your baby will be outside for a long period of time, don’t forget the sunscreen! Winter sun can be deceptive and is often more powerful than summer sun.


Avoid sun exposure for young babies and block the sun from their skin with layered clothing, a hat, or a light blanket. For children six months or older, apply a baby-safe sunscreen before every outing.

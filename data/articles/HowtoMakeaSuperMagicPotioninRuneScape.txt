Collect a lantadyme herb. Invest in clean lantadyme for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy lantadymes are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming.
Purchase a vial. Acquire water-filled vial packs to save you time. Any unused vials can be stored in your bank for later usage.
Collect 1 potato cacti. Potato cactus can be obtained by either farming (if you have a level 86 farming), from spirit impling loots, and drops from different monsters.
 This will create a "Lantadyme Potion (unf)".
 This will create a three dose super magic potion.

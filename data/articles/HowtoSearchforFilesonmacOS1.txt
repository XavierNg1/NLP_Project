 On macOS Sierra, Siri allows you to search for files with your voice; if you know what the document you are looking for is called, this can be a quick way to access it. To open Siri, you can either:


Click the Siri icon in the top-right corner of your screen (A black circle displaying red, green and blue wavelengths).
Press and hold command+space.;
, If you know the name of the file you would like to open, ask Siri to open the file. With a slow and clear voice, say:


Open File name.
 If you're not sure what the name of the file that you'd like to open is, but are aware of any number of terms it contains, you can tell Siri to:


Show me files containing search term.
 Perhaps you can see where this is going. To locate all of the work from a particular day, try the command:


Show me files from .
 If you'd prefer to find a file by opening the application that it was saved in, simply tell Siri to open that application.

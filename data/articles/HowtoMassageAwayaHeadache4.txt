 Headaches caused by the temporalis muscle are very common. The temporalis muscles is located on the sides of your head, going from your upper jaw, over the top of your ear and then back behind your ear. Problems with the temporalis muscle can be linked to TMJ problems as well., While either sitting or standing up straight, press the fingertips of your index and middle fingers of both hands to the spots above your temple. While pressing, open and close your jaw several times. Move your fingers around, in that general area, to all the spots where you feel discomfort and open and close your jaw several times at each spot.As an alternative, you can simply yawn over and over again to stretch the temporalis muscles without using your hands to apply any pressure.
 Get both temporalis muscles heated up slightly before you do this stretch by putting hot packs, a heating pad at low temperature, or a warm wet cloth on both sides of your head above your ear. Once the muscles are loosened up, lie on your back and look at the ceiling. Put the index finger of either hand inside your mouth and pull your jaw down by applying pressure to the area just behind your bottom teeth., Lie on your back and look at the ceiling. Put your right index and middle fingers on your right cheek, just on top of your teeth. Put your left index and middle fingers on your lower jaw. Use your left hand to push your jaw to the left. You can repeat the same process to the right by switching the location of your hands.To do this as a stretch, your jaw should be relaxed and shouldn’t cause any resistance to the movement of your jaw to the left and right. If you’ve been working the area for a while and you want to try strengthening the muscle instead of just stretching it, you can add some resistance to the movement of your lower jaw.

 A spicier variant on the usual bruschetta, this is great for cold nights as an accompaniment to a hot soup.;
, Throw in some salsa to spice up the flavor next time you make or cook pre-made macaroni cheese. Add about 10 minutes before the end of cooking time and stir through. New pizazz to an old favorite!

, And some mashed re-fried beans, some jalape√±os, some tomatillos, and you are making one deliciously mean pizza!

, Use leftover rice and mix through the salsa, some black beans and corn pieces. Garnish with avocado pieces.
 It's piquant and more interesting than the usual ketchup.
 This will really warm up the soup and bring out a spicier flavor. Great for tomato based soups but also interestingly tasty for such soups as pumpkin, sweet potato and minestrone soups.

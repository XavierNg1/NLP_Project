 If you are a new parent, it may seem hard to get enough sleep while taking care of the baby. If you and your partner are having trouble getting enough sleep, split up the night shifts. Alternate nights with each other, so that you are responsible for waking up with the baby one night and then your partner is responsible the next night.


This can help you get a few nights of adequate sleep a week, which is better than none.
You can even have the person who is staying up with the baby sleep in a separate room so you get more undisturbed sleep., In order for you and your partner to get at least some solid hours of sleep per night, you can also try taking shifts. Split the night into two equal shifts, where you take one shift and your partner takes the other. This way, you will be responsible for your child while your partner sleeps soundly and vice versa., For those late night feeding sessions, pump your milk before you go to sleep. This way, you won't have to wake up each time your baby needs to feed and your partner can handle it some during the night., One way to get more sleep is to go to bed when your baby does. This way, you get more sleep before she wakes up for the first time. This may be hard with how much you have to do in a day, but if you find yourself with a serious sleep deficit, this can help you and your partner get some much needed sleep during those first hours when she is sleeping soundly., To help your baby sleep better at night, you may choose to sleep with him in the bed with you. This can help him feel more comfortable at night, wake up less when he is just fussy, and help him only wake up when he is hungry.There are some hazards to having your baby sleep with you, so make sure you ask your pediatrician if there are guidelines you need to follow before you do this.

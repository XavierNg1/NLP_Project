 The saucepan method for making coffee is the simplest, and it requires only basic kitchen equipment. Combine your water and coffee in a saucepan. Add 2 extra tablespoons (30 ml) to the saucepan as well to account for moisture loss.


Because this method doesnâ€™t require any sort of filtration, you may find coffee granules and particles in your drink.
 Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the water to a boil, stirring regularly. Once boiling, simmer the coffee for two minutes. When the time is up, remove the pan from the heat.Set the coffee aside for four minutes to let the grounds settle on the bottom of the saucepan.
 When all the grounds have sunk to the bottom of the pan, slowly and gently pour the coffee out of the saucepan and into a mug. Be careful not to pour the grounds in as well.


You can also use a ladle to transfer the coffee from the pan to the mug. Be gentle to avoid stirring up the grounds.

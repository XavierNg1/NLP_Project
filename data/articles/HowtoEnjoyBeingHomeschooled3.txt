 Eating and running around when you want to are cool, but the best part of being home schooled is having a little control over what you study. If you are reading novels, for example, you can talk to your mom, dad, or whoever is in charge of teaching you and talk about books that you want to choose! You don’t have to read the same boring classics as the other kids in your grade.Maybe you would like to read the Harry Potter series, or The Hunger Games.
 If you struggle with some subjects, but do really well in others, you can move quickly through the things you are good at, and spend more time getting help with the things that are hard. This isn’t so easy in a classroom where a teacher needs to work with 30 students. At home school, you can always work at your own pace., You may also be able to make your hobbies and interests a part of the lesson. If you love snowboarding, you can use that to study physics, science, or weather. If you love art, you can spend time studying art history. Whatever you are really into, you can find a way to work it into what you are studying.Talk to your parent/teacher about creative ways to include your interests into your school lessons.
 When you are home schooled, you might be able to make choices about what when you study. In regular school, you must follow the schedule set for you.For instance, maybe you work better if you spend a long time on certain subjects, and break the subjects up over different days (like block scheduling).
With home schooling, you can develop a schedule that works for your parent/teacher and you.
Even if you don't get a lot of choice when it comes to scheduling, be grateful that you don't have to sit in a classroom from 7am-3pm!

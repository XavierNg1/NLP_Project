 If your paper is a rectangle, simply fold one corner across the paper so that two of the sides match up. There will be an extra rectangular flap that isnâ€™t part of the triangle that this creates. Cut this flap off and unfold the triangle.;
, Fold it once lengthwise and once widthwise, in either order, to make a small square., You want it to look like a diamond to you with the bottom point closest to you. Fold your diamond vertically along the middle. To do this, simply take the point on the right and fold it over to match up with the point on the left.
 Cut shapes out of this triangle. Cut small shapes out of the edges to make intricate designs in your snowflake., Carefully unfold your paper to reveal your 4-point snowflake. It may not lay flat, so stick it, unfolded, into a book or in a stack of magazines for a couple of hours. Once it lays flat naturally, hang your snowflake in your window or around the house.

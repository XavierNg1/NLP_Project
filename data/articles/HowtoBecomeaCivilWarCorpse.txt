 A quick Google search will tell you which reenacting groups are in your area. Also, it helps to live near where an actual Civil War battle took place.;
, Nothing is more embarrassing than running around a National Park by yourself and then falling over.
 Remember, the American Civil War was fought between the Union and Confederate armies. Knights and storm troopers were not at the Battle of the Shiloh.
 Some reenactors march in columns with their units. Others run onto the battlefield waving their arms and screaming. It's your call.
 Make sure you time your falling over just after the sound of your enemy's gun. Nothing is more embarrassing than falling over to silence. You will look like the world's stupidest soldier. Also, take care not to fall over after the sound of your own side's guns, lest you look like you just got fragged.
 Spectators need to know where you've just been shot, and that it hurts. Hence the clutching.
 This area is open to the most artistic interpretation. Most people go with AAAGGGHHH! but the more elaborate death cries also build backstory into your character. For example, try "This one's for you Aunt Be-AAAGGGHHH!" or "I'm coming for you Mr. Linc-AAAGGGHHH!". Another helpful tip is to reference the side you're fighting: "The only good Reb is a dead AAAGGGHHH!" The most important thing to remember with the death cry is you must interrupt whatever you were going to say with AAAGGGHHH!

, If you're in the front rank, fall forward so you don't knock over the guy behind you, and if you are in the rear rank fall backwards.
 You must remain still until the battle is over. An exception to the rule is if the reenactment allows zombies (see Tips section).

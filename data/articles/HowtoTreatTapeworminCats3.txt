 Hunting and eating vermin is a source of tapeworm infection, and stopping a cat from hunting is an excellent way of preventing infection with the taenia species of tapeworm.
 The other source of infection are fleas. The cat and all other animals in the household should be treated with an effective product as directed on the manufacturer's guidelines.


There are many products available, but those proven to be the most effective are those containing fipronil (Frontline, Frontline Plus, and Efipro) as well as selamectin (Revolutions US, Stronghold UK,).
 Tapeworm egg packets are a sign of active infection and any cat shedding egg packets must be wormed.


Likewise, if your cat acquires fleas, you should use a product effective against tapeworms at the same time as treating the fleas. Cats that hunt should be treated monthly.
Current veterinary advice is to worm all cats at least every 3 months with a product that is effective against both roundworms and tapeworms.

 Please note that the Tentaclaws pop in and out and that they have the added bonus of swallowing you up and spitting you out Leechgrave, which causes huge damage. Magic helps, but doing so or defeating more Tentaclaws will cause pollen bursts from Leechgrave that drain your HP. NEVER attack Leechgrave head on without taking out the Tentaclaws first. If you did, you would have to very quickly dodge the giant claw that comes out of the coffin. And at one point you would lose anyway. Stay as far as you can from Leechgrave.;
, The Leechgrave shall become dizzy and fall down. This is your chance to strike.
 Then GET THE HECK OUT OF THERE!

, Repeat until it dies.

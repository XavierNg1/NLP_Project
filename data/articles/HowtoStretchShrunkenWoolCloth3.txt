 Wet your wool article by submerging it in water or running lukewarm water over it until the wool is saturated but not soaked. Wetting the wool loosens the fibers so that it is easier to stretch.Save this method of stretching wool only if the other two donâ€™t work as it does run the risk of damaging the wool item.
 Lay out two dry bath towels side by side on a counter or other flat surface. Place heavy objects on the edges of the towels or pin them in place so that they cannot move around and will stay completely flat., Stretch out your wool item by hand, working in small sections and then stretching the garment from top to bottom and side to side., Pin the bottom edge of the wool item to the towel using sewing pins. Pull at the top of the garment to stretch it, then pin the top of the item with sewing pins. Repeat this process, this time pinning each side of the wool item.Be aware that the process of pinning your garment can possibly damage the garment by creating gaps in the wool.
 Leave the pinned wool item to air dry. Once the wool has dried completely, carefully remove the pins. The item should keep its stretched shape.

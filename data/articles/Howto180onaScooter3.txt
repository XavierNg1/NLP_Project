 If you are a little scared of landing a traditional 180, there is a safer version. During a faux 180 your feet leave the scooter momentarily while the scooter performs a 180. This is inspired by old school skateboarding tricks where they’d incorporate one foot on the pavement.
 You will want to get comfortable whipping your scooter in a 180. While off your scooter, spin the handle bars around so the scooter does a 180. Once you get a feel for the movement required by your hands, try incorporating your body.


Once the scooter completes a 180, hop on with your feet right before the scooter hits the surface., Once you’ve practiced in your garage a few times, it’s time to bring it to the streets. You don’t need to go too fast to pull this one off. Just gain a casual speed.
 Try to hop off with one foot while spinning the handlebar in a 180 motion. The best look is when one foot is on the ground, one foot in the air, and the scooter operating a 180 spin.


For starting out, you can hop off with both feet.
 Once the scooter completes the 180, try to hop back onto the scooter while it’s still in the air. This way you and the scooter land the 180 at the same time.

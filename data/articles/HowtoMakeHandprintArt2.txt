 Your child will be more willing to participate when contented.
 Instead of finding items as you go, have everything purchased and unpacked before you bring your child into the project. If you are using paint, pour paint into separate bowls or plates and have plenty of towels and water for clean up. Also, if you plan to create a project (such as a plaster handprint), read the directions ahead of time so the project goes smoothly when your child is ready to participate.
 A picnic table outside or the kitchen table covered in newspaper is a great spot for an art project.
 If your child will be actively participating in the project, explain what he or she will be doing and every step that will be taken along the way. That way, your child can mentally prepare for what will need to be done and may be more patient.

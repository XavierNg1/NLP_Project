, In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks until they are well beaten. Whisk in the sugar, flour and salt until they are fully combined with the yolks.
 Slowly pour the warmed milk or cream into the egg mixture with one hand, while whisking constantly with the other. When you've finished pouring the milk or cream in, transfer the whole mixture back to the small saucepan.

Another way to check to see if the pastry cream is finished cooking is to stop whisking for a second and look for bubbles popping. If you see a few large bubbles rise to the surface and pop, it's time to remove the pastry cream from the heat.
 Place a strainer over a large bowl and pour the pastry cream from the saucepan through the strainer. Use the back of a spoon or a spatula to help push the pastry cream through the strainer into the bowl.

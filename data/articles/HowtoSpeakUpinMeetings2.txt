 You don’t have to add anything mind-blowing or groundbreaking when you want to speak up at a meeting. You can agree with someone or tell them that you like their idea. Everyone likes to feel understood and complimented, so your comment may go far with them.For example, say, “I really like what Heidi said” or, “I think that’s a great idea and we should start working on it, Rea.”

, Speak up by seeking clarification for things that are unclear. You can ask someone to expand on their idea or take it in a different direction. Questions can also help to further develop the understanding of the topic. Asking questions gets you engaged and involved.Say, “Can you clarify that?” or, “What do you mean by that?”

, You don’t have to come up with creative ideas on your own to contribute to a meeting. Speaking up is as easy as saying, “Everyone seems to agree on this, let’s move forward.” If you want to add something to what another person has said, say, “To build on what Sheri said, I’d like to add…”You can even say, “Were you going to say something, Kai?”

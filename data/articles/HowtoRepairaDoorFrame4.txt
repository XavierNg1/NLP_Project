 Survey the frame for areas that need to be filled. Animal bites, door keys, bed frames and other accidents can cause a variety of light dents and gouges in the door frame.


Gently push and pull at any visible nicks, dents or scratches to test the severity of the damage. If pieces of wood pull away, a more complex repair might be necessary., Smaller nicks, dents and gouges can be filled in with a body or wood filler. Use a putty knife to apply the filler into the gouges.


Use wood or body fillers for cosmetic damage such as slight gouges or dents. They lack the structural integrity of harder fillers such as epoxy, but tend to have a more pleasant aesthetic.
If you expect the door frame to continue to take a lot of wear and tear, use the epoxy filler to provide extra strength to the repair. The epoxy filler will have a greater resistance to future nicks and scratches than wood or body filler. You can also have sheet metal bent to cover the susceptible area.
Alternatively, if the damage is very minor, you can sand out the damaged area rather than applying filler.
 Once dry, sand to smoothness as desired. Finish with one coat of primer and two coats of paint. Use a straight edge to help keep the filler level and in place when applying to vertical surfaces.

Shower every second day or after playing a lot of sports.
Shower the evening beforehand or in the morning before school. Shampoo and condition your hair and use soap or a nice body wash to smell as fresh as a daisy.
Wrap long hair up in a towel turban to help it dry.
If your hair is really greasy use dry shampoo to freshen up between showers.



Deodorant will not stop you sweating but will mask any bad smells from the sweat. Anti-perspirant will stop you from sweating in the first place. Body sprays smell great and are fun to wear but they do not have any effect on sweat so remember to use a deodorant as well.
You may not need to wear deodorant or antiperspirant everyday yet but you should ask your parents if you can have some to wear during strenuous exercise, like training or a match.
If you aren't allowed used deodorant or antiperspirant sprinkle some talcum powder under your arms instead.



Wear the correct school uniform, even if your friends don't.
Remember to bring your kit if you have PE or training. Always wash your sports gear after you wear it.
Remember to wear a coat, scarf, gloves, sunscreen or a sunhat as needs be. Sunscreen may be gross but sunburn is ten times worse.



Dry your hair before school with a hair dryer if it is wet.
Brush or comb your hair everyday, even if it is short.

Style your hair. You might like to wax it or try a plait or ponytail. Don't use heated appliances like straighteners, curlers, hair dryers or crimpers more than once a week. It's not worth the damage you will do.
If you have long hair your school rules might say that it has to be tied up. It is a good idea to tie your hair up anyway in case headlice break out in your school.
 You might like to use mouthwash or dental floss occasionally.
, It's better than arriving late, you might miss out on something funny or weird (or even just some important work) and have to miss some break time, get sent to the principals office, etc and you don't want that happening.

 Now that you’ve selected a location for the hutch, you need to make sure the ground there is level. This is important since most hutches have either four legs or a flat bottom. Ultimately, you don’t want your hutch leaning to one side or another, as a bad rainstorm or wind could knock it over and injure its inhabitants.


Take a shovel and level the ground where the hutch will be.
Spread out dirt and rock to form a level surface.
Employ a large level (tool) to verify that the ground is indeed flat., After you’ve leveled the ground, you need to put the hutch in place and assemble it. Assembling the hutch is also very important, as you need to make sure it is put together properly and is secure. If your hutch is not put together properly, your rabbits could get out, or intruders could get in and hurt your rabbits.


If you’ve bought a new hutch from the store, follow the directions that come with the hutch. Most store-bought hutches will be relatively simple to put together.
If you’ve bought a second-hand hutch, chances are it will require minimal assembly. Make sure you have all of the pieces and put it back together the way it was before you transported it.
If you're building your own hutch, make sure you build one that is stable and secure.
Position the hutch. After you’ve assembled the hutch, move it into position onto the level ground you prepared., After you’ve assembled and positioned the hutch, take a minute to carefully review it for damages or defects. This is important, as you want to make sure the hutch is safe and ready for your rabbit friends.


Look to see there are no sharp or pointy pieces of metal or frayed wire. Cut these or bend them so they pose no risk to the rabbits.
If your hutch uses wire, make sure that there are no gaps or large spaces in the wire from which a rabbit could sneak out. If there is, use some spare wire to cover the gap.
Make sure the hutch is sitting on completely flat ground and the base is stable.

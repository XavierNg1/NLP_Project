 If you see a dust storm from some distance, and you are in a vehicle or have access to one, you may be able to outrun it or detour around it.Some dust storms can travel at more than 75 mph (121 km/h), but they frequently travel much slower. Trying to outrun a storm, however, is not advisable if you have to put yourself at risk by traveling at high speeds. If the storm is catching up with you, it's best to stop and prepare for it. Once consumed by the storm, your visibility can potentially be reduced to zero in a matter of seconds.


Do not try to outrun a storm on foot. Wind storms are unpredictable, and you could be easily overcome if it suddenly changes direction or picks up speed.
Drive to a safe place where you can take shelter until the storm passes.
 If you're in transit and visibility drops to less than 300 feet (91.4 m), pull off the road (exit the freeway if possible), set your parking brake, turn off your headlights, and make sure brake lights and turn signals are also off.


If you are unable to safely pull off the road, keep your headlights on, turn on your hazard lights, slow down, and proceed with caution, sounding your horn periodically. Use the highway's centerline to guide you if you can't see in front of you. Pull over at the nearest safe spot.
Turning your headlights off while stationed off the road will reduce the possibility of a rear-end collision. In many cases, if your exterior lights are on, other drivers will use the taillights of the person in front of them as a guide to help navigate the road ahead of them. If you are pulled off the road and are sitting there with your lights on, someone might think they can follow you and run right off the road or even collide with you.
 Do not attempt to move about in a blinding storm, as you will not be able to see potential hazards in your path.


Roll up the windows and turn off vents that bring outside air in.
Don't move your vehicle until the storm has safely passed.

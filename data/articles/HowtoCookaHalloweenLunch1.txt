, Put individual chocolate chips on one of the flat sides of a marshmallow.
 Cut each lace into fours. Lay three of them on the sides of the marshmallow from the bottom up. Have three others come from the chocolate chip.

If you can't get them to stick, get a toothpick and scratch the place where you want to put the shoelace. Do the same to the shoelace. Then stick the shoelace on.

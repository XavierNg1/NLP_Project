 Do you have a friend, family member, or colleague whose handwriting you like? Closely examine their handwriting and try to determine exactly what it is that you like about the style. Perhaps you are drawn to the way their letters flow together, or the consistency in size. Once you have discovered what you like about their writing try to incorporate some of their technique into your own penmanship.Try tracing their writing. The more you practice the easier it will be to bring some of their writing style into your own handwriting.
 Regardless of the type of handwriting you have decided on, cursive or print, you should create a set of consistent letters that you like and that look good together. When you write a letter the way you like it- with the appropriate height, curve, and slant- continue to write that letter over and over again and fill up an entire page. This will help you develop consistent lettering that is unique to your own individual style.Try writing a full page of upper and lower case letters for each letter in the alphabet.
 Many people believe that you can learn a lot about a person from studying their handwriting. Think about the type of person you are and try and come up with ways to make your personality shine through in your unique handwriting style. For example, if you are considered tough you may want to develop bold and angular lettering. Similarly, if you are an organized and tidy person, allow that to be reflected in your handwriting by creating crisp, neat, and uniform letters.

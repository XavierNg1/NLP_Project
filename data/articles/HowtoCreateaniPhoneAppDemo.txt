 One of the best selling scenario is showing your potential users how your app solves one of their problems.;
, When you are on a screen that you want to capture, press and hold the Home button and then press the Power/Sleep button. Your screenshots will then appear in your photo gallery on your iPhone/iPad. When done, send the screenshots to your PC. Alternatively, you can take screenshots from the iPhone Simulator.
 You can sign up with your Google and Facebook Accounts or create an AppDemoStore account.
 In the section "My Demos", click the "Create Demo" button. Select a frame for your demo (Simple Apple iPhone 4, Apple iPhone 4 in Hand, etc.) and give your demo a relevant name. The frame will be visible when the demo is viewed on a computer and not visible when viewed on a smartphone or tablet.
 You do this by clicking the button "Upload Screenshots" and selecting the files from your disk (multiple file upload is possible).
 Use "Hotspot" to add so-called interaction areas to your screen. When clicked, a hotspot directs the user to the next screen or any other screen of your demo. You can also add animations (slide, fade, loading effects and scrollable areas) and annotations (text boxes and callouts).
, Your website visitors will be able to click through your app demo right on your website.
Include (embed) it into your iPhone/iPad app by copying the embedding code provided on the demo page (click the button "Mobile" available under the demo itself). This is a great use case for clickable tutorials.
Share the link to this demo on social networks or over email.
View it on your iPhone/iPad in any mobile browser. For the best view experience, use a browser that supports full-screen, such as Mercury and Dolphin Mobile browsers.

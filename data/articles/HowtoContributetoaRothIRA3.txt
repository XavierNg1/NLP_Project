 If you file taxes as a widow, widower, or a married couple that files taxes jointly, your maximum IRA contribution level will be different than that of someone who files taxes as a single person, head of household, or someone who is married but filing taxes separately from their spouse. To calculate your reduced contribution, subtract your MAGI from $183,000, then divide the difference by $10,000. Round the quotient to at least three decimal places. If the quotient is greater than 1, use the number "1" for the next question.Multiply the quotient by either $5,500 or your taxable compensation for the year, whichever is least. Subtract the product from either $5,500 or your taxable compensation for the year, whichever is least. Round the result to the closest $10. Enter $200 if the result is less than $200.
Compare the result to the answer of the next calculation. This final calculation is the number you get when you subtract the amount you contributed to other IRAs that year from either $5,500 or your taxable compensation for the year, whichever is least. Whichever of these two numbers is least is your Roth IRA reduced contribution limit.
For instance, if you earn $190,000, subtract $183,000. This yields $7,000. Dividing that by $10,000 gives you 0.700. Assuming your taxable compensation exceeds $5,500 that year, multiply $5,500 by 0.700. This yields $3,850. Doing the final calculation and assuming you have no other IRAs, you will subtract zero from $5,500, yielding $5,500. Since $3,850 is less than $5,500, your maximum allowable IRA contribution for that tax year is $3,850.
 If you are a married individual who lived with your spouse at any point during the year but is filing taxes separately, your reduced IRA contribution will be different than that of someone who is a widow, widower, or who is married and filing jointly with their spouse. To figure your reduced Roth IRA maximum contribution, start by dividing your MAGI by $10,000. Round the quotient to three decimal places. If the quotient is greater than 1, use the number "1" for the next question.Multiply the quotient by either $5,500 or your taxable compensation for the year, whichever is least. Subtract the product from either $5,500 or your taxable compensation for the year, whichever is least. Round the result to the closest $10. Enter $200 if the result is less than $200.
Compare the result to the answer of the next calculation. In this last calculation, you’ll subtract the amount you contributed to other IRAs that year from either $5,500 or your taxable compensation for the year, whichever is least. Comparing this number with the other, choose the lower of the two to determine your Roth IRA reduced contribution limit.
 If you are a single person, head of household, or a married person who is filing separately from your spouse (and have not lived with your spouse during the tax year), your contribution reduction limit will differ from that of a married individual who lived with their spouse at any point during the year but is filing separately, a widow, widower, or a married couple who files jointly. Begin by subtracting your MAGI from $116,000. Then, divide that number by $15,000. Round your answer out to three decimal places. If the quotient is above 1, use the number "1" for the next question.Multiply the quotient by either $5,500 or your taxable compensation for the year, whichever is least. Subtract the product from either $5,500 or your taxable compensation for the year, whichever is the least. Round your result to the closest $10. Enter $200 if the result is below $200.
Save the number of the above calculation and compare it with the next answer. In this last calculation, you’ll subtract the amount you contributed to other IRAs that year from either $5,500 or your taxable compensation for the year, whichever is least. Compare this number with the other, and choose the lower of the two to determine your Roth IRA reduced contribution limit.

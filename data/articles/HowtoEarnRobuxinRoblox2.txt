 Buying collectible items usually requires that you already have a whole bunch of robux available. Selling requires Builder's Club and that someone else is willing to buy at the price you set.
 You can add robux to trades, and if someone is willing you can trade a high-value collectible away for the value of the collectible in robux.
 If you have Builders' Club, you can create cool shirts or pants and then sell them for Robux!

, If you're a skilled builder or scripter, you can easily earn money by selling your creations, or yourself for hire. When I mean yourself, I mean that you are hired by someone to build/script something for them for a set time. The best place to start off with selling your creations is at the Group Recruiting Plaza ( http://www.roblox.com/games/6194809/Group-Recruiting-Plaza-NEW-DISCORD-SERVER ). Although it is supposed to be a Group Recruitment Center, many people go there to sell their creations! You can build a Cafe or a Script for someone and they might even pay you 2k ROBUX. I would mainly recommend starting off with the low numbers so that people get even more dragged in.

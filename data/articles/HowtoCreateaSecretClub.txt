 They can be your friends or they can be random people you tell about your club. Make sure they will fit in and will be ever loyal to your club. Make sure to mention the stuff you do and how much fun the club is. Tell them about your secret handshake and your secrets about your crushes and your best friend sleepovers.;
, A good one is, "Don't tell anyone about the club because it is a secret." Another good rule is, "When you find a person who might fit in, do not tell them but discuss it at a meeting with all the other members of the club to figure out and judge them to see if they fit in."

, It could be at your house or it could be at your favorite restaurant it all depends on your choice. If you cannot afford a restaurant, just cook at home and engage your friends in this activity too.
 Maybe, a lemonade stand for charity. Make sure to wear things that match such as the color pink or a skirt.
 Maybe talk about your day,your secrets or your family.
, Be creative! Engage this as an activity and lay some stuff out.

You should be in a cave like mining place with a lot of wood everywhere supporting it.



If you did it correctly, you should see what looks like some wooden boards nailed to the sides of a pathway. Take a grenade (it doesn't matter what kind) and throw it as close as possible to the boards and it should blow up.
 Keep going in.

You should see a bunch of people including Tanya, the Australian guy and some Germans break dancing.






Where the music equipment is playing at, there should be an M1919A6 Browning.30 on the ground.

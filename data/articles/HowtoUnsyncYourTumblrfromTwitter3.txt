 It's a dark-blue app with a white "t" on it. Tumblr will open to your home page if you're already signed in.


If you aren't signed into Tumblr, tap Sign in, enter your email address and password, and tap Sign in.
 This is either at the bottom-center of the screen (iPhone) or in the bottom-right corner of the screen (Android).
 You can turn off Twitter for any type of post.
 You'll see this bird-shaped icon either in the top-right side of your post (iPhone) or at the bottom-right side of the page (Android). The icon will turn grey, signifying that this post won't go to Twitter when you publish it.


If the bird icon is grey, your post isn't set to post to Twitter.

 Establish the habit of focusing on the present moment, rather than on the future. When you’re in a mindful state, your anxiety doesn’t control you. Instead, you can figure out where your fears are coming from and how you want to react to them.Daily meditation can help you get into the habit of mindfulness.
 Strengthening your sense of self will help you feel less afraid of abandonment. One of the best ways to do this is to pursue your passions, especially on your own. Spending quality time doing things that interest you will improve your emotional self-reliance and help you focus on something other than your relationships.You could sign up for a class, buy a book on something you’ve always wanted to learn, or set aside an hour every day to paint or write.
 Over-relying on other people — financially, emotionally, or otherwise — can create fears of abandonment or make them worse. Fight over-dependence by taking steps to become more self-reliant in the areas where you don’t feel confident.For example, you might want to practice asserting yourself more strongly, save money of your own, or practice better self-care.
 Spend time with friends and family, and reach out to make new friends. It’s easier to feel secure in your relationships when you have a large support network to rely on.Focus on enjoying your relationships in the present, instead of worrying about how long they will last.
 Journaling can help you work through your feelings, set goals for yourself, and track your progress. Spend a few minutes every day writing and reflecting on your thoughts and emotions.Try using structured journaling prompts if you get stuck on what to write about.

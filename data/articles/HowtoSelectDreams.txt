 When choosing a dream, results are rarely pinpoint accurate. So, to induce as much detail as possible, you will want to be relaxed, and comfortable. Wear good pyjamas, fluff your pillows, take a long bath. Do whatever it takes to clear your mind and calm you down.
 Breathe through your nose if possible, and empty your mind., Form a clear, detailed picture of the sort of dream you want to have. As an example, choose a flying dream. For this, picture what you are exactly. What you look like, how you fly, colours, and clothes. Then picture the landscape. Get a clear, vivid image in your head., Picture the basic 'plot' of your dream. Arrange it into a small clip in your mind, and play it several times, focusing on keeping calm., Keep replaying the details and the plot until you fall asleep.,

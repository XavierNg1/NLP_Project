 Make sure they know you are there to have fun, not to stick around with your friends! If you are meeting up with boys from a mixed school expect company from girls as well. Make friends with them too or you are going nowhere. And don't fight with your friends over a boy. Don't be desperate, if there is a guy who you don't like, or is nasty, don't take him for the sake of having a boyfriend.;
, Always stay true and have pride in yourself and your friends. If a guy or a group of people gives you a bad feeling, stay away from them. But, if the people around you are nice, don't be shy

, If you go out with friends, instead of hanging with an elite group, welcome people to invite other friends. Your best friend might know the perfect guy for you.If you go to an all girls school and take the bus, see if you can get off at a different stop and walk the rest of the way home, each day getting to know any boys who get on/off there.
 You're bound to meet at least one interesting guy there.
 Join a group or class outside of school that involves something that you love or a hobby. Chances are there will be a guy there, and you two already have something in common!

, If you get to know a pleasant guy, don't feel you have to do something like holding hands or kissing straight away. Simply have fun and try to have a good conversation. If he shows interest in keeping contact, you know he likes you or at least finds you interesting.
 If the boy you are talking to isn't prince charming, who knows, he might know the prince for you.
 You have your own special qualities.
, Even if you have a uniform, look good. What if you go for coffee later? Make sure you keep within boundaries, so no super mini skirts and bra tops, or you will not be labelled girlfriend material.
 Make an effort to go shopping, go for lunch, anything!

, Don't feel like you have to speak to him everyday, everyone likes their space.

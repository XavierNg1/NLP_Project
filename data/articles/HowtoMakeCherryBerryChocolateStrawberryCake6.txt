Spread half the strawberries and half the raspberries on top of the ganache. Place 10 of the cherries on top of the berries. Spread half the chocolate mousse over the fruit.
 Spread a thin layer of ganache over the top of the second cake. Again, place the cake in the fridge to allow the ganache to set. Spread the rest of the strawberries and raspberries on top of the ganache.
 Spread the rest of the mousse over the fruit.
 Spread a thin layer of ganache over the top of the third cake. Place the cake in the fridge until the ganache is set.
 Decorate with the raspberries and the rest of the cherries. Enjoy!

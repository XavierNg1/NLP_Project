 The easiest way to get Age of Mythology to work on stubborn new computers is to simply buy the Extended Edition off of Steam. This version of the game was released in 2014 and is specifically meant to update the game for modern computers. Though this requires a purchase, the price tag may be worth avoiding future headaches.
 This feature of Windows 7 is designed to make it easy to run programs designed for older computers. It doesn't always work, but it's certainly worth trying. Use the following steps:Click Start, then open the Control Panel.
Open "Troubleshooting" (you can type this in the search bar to find it faster).
Under "Programs," click "Run programs made for older versions of Windows."
Follow the prompts. You may need to use the troubleshooter to open the game's setup.exe file.
 This is the same tool that's available on Windows 8, but it's accessed in a different way:Swipe in from the right side of the screen. If you're using a mouse, move the cursor to the bottom right corner of the screen, then move it up.
Click "Search." Type "run programs" in the search box.
Click "Run programs made for previous versions of Windows," then click "Next."
Follow the prompts. You'll either need to select the program from the list or (more likely) click "Not listed" and locate it on your own.
 Getting Titan to work on Macs can be extra hard because it wasn't design for Mac use in the first place. Your best bet is probably to use a program called Boot Camp, which allows you to install Windows on your Mac computer.


See WikiHow's own How to Use Boot Camp or the Apple support page for Boot Camp for step-by-step directions.

 For this recipe, it is very important to use regular cream cheese -- the reduced fat kind won't give your candies the right consistency in addition to not tasting great.









Softened is key here. If your ingredients aren't, they won't combine nicely. That goes for too cold or too melted, for the record.;
, Be careful not to over beat the mixture -- once it's in ball shape, it's good to go.
 Use your hands if it doesn't seem to be combining quickly enough. You want the coconut dispersed evenly throughout the mixture.
 Or roll into small balls, if that suits your fancy. For bite-sized pieces, this recipe should yield about 40.
 Throw in a few potatoes and roll them around in it like jumping beans. Then place them on a different plate or baking sheet and place them in the fridge for an hour or until firm.









If "dirtier" potatoes are more your thing, roll them in a second coating of cinnamon. Or if cinnamon isn't your favorite, dip them in melted chocolate -- great for making Easter eggs.

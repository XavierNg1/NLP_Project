Cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Stir occasionally. The cooking is done when the mixture has reduced and the pumpkin is dry. Remove from the heat and leave to stand.;
, Bring the cream to a boil, then remove immediately.
 Add the chocolate and let it melt in untouched for a minute. Then, stir gradually from the center of the bowl to the outer edge. Once mixed well, add the pumpkin mixture made earlier and gently stir through.


Add the butter and mix in. Pour in the liqueur or juice and mix through.
, Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Using a melon baller, form small balls from the pumpkin truffle mixture and arrange the balls in rows on the lined cookie sheet.


Return to the refrigerator to chill for another hour.
 Take the truffle balls out of the refrigerator and dip each ball in the melted chocolate. Use a chocolate/candy dipping tool to make this easier. Ensure that each ball is completely coated in chocolate.
 The pumpkin truffles are now ready to serve or box for gift giving.

 You will need to cite the textbook next to information you use from it within the text of your paper.


Introduce the author or authors in the sentence. One way to cite a textbook in APA format is to introduce the author in the sentence. Use the last name only. If there are no authors, but there is an editor, the editor should be listed instead. End with the publication year in parentheses.
Example: According to Smith, the theory is not sound (2000). Example two: Clark and Hernandez believe otherwise (1994).
 If you use a quotation or direct passage from the textbook, you also need to indicate the page.List the page number at the end of the quote as noted (p. page number).
Example: According to Jones (1998), "Students often had difficulty using APA style, especially when it was their first time" (p. 199).
 If you do not introduce the author in the sentence, you must include the author's last name in the parentheses that follow the quoted or borrowed text. If there are multiple authors, list all of them. Put a comma after the last name of the author and then the year of publication.


Example: This belief was proven wrong thanks to new research (Johnson, 2008).
Studies indicate otherwise (Smith, Johnson & Hernandez, 1999).

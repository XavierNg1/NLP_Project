 You will want something that has no (or very few) moving parts. Shooting on a wide seamless background is an optimal solution.


If you are going out on location, for adding the images to later, shoot from various heights and angles.;
, You don't want it to have any kind of movement. That is why you want some kind of remote triggering option.
 There is a lot less margin for error at faster apertures.
 The tripod and camera must stay stationary.
 This will be a 'reference' shot and around which your shot will be created. You will want all of the elements that will be added later, to be missing from this shot. This will be your 'base layer'.
, Gimp, Paint Shop Pro, and Photoshop are all good ones.
 This will help keep the lighting and look the same and give you a more cohesive image.

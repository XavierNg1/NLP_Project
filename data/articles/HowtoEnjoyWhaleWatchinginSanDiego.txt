 While making your reservations for the cruise, check out whether the tour operator has trained naturalists on board who are equipped to deliver an informed narration and also handle your queries. Also find out if the ship has a well-stocked snack bar and beverages bar or if you are to bring your own food.Most importantly, from the safety and security point of view, check if the boat/ship is Coast Guard certified; are they a member of a self-regulated Whale Watching Operators Association; and if they are willing to take you on a free trip if you don’t sight any whales.


Whale-watching cruises range from a two-hour trip out of a local harbor to multi-day cruises to Baja, Mexico. Depending upon your interest level, you can book short or long tours.;
, If you like to travel with less people, choose a morning tour as these are less crowded. Weekdays are also relatively less busy than weekends.
  Also remember to carry a waterproof jacket, as some boats kick up a spray.
 Besides you will also need sunscreen, even in cloudy weather, as 60% of the sunlight bounces off the water surface and can damage your skin. Sunglasses are a must as the sun rays reflected off the water can be harsh on the eyes.San Diego is one of the top gray whale watching destinations in the world. So have fun whale watching but do remember to take the precautions.

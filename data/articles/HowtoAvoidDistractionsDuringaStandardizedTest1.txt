 If you haven't got it by now, one day of cramming is very unlikely to make a difference. In fact, it's more likely to actually harm your performance, as you try to overlap short-term information over top long-term information. Refuse the urge to keep your nose in the books.;
, You've hopefully been exerting yourself a great deal as you've prepared for your test. Now is the time to spend the day relaxing, diverting your attention away from everything test-related. This may mean renting a few movies for the day followed by going out to dinner. Whatever it is you do to relax and recharge, do it (but avoid alcohol, see section below). If you feel your mind creeping toward thoughts of the test, re-direct it immediately toward relaxing and recharging.
 Men should consume roughly 3 liters (about 13 cups) of total beverages a day and women should consume 2.2 liters (about 9 cups). In particular, adults should ingest approximately 35-50 milliliters of fluids per kilogram of body weight per day. (Use a fluid calculator). Optimize your fluid intake the day before testing. See the section below, "Fluid intake," for why.
 Adult sleep requirements vary but average around 8 hours per night. Whatever a full night's sleep is for you, get it. Also, during the week leading up to your test day, buy a battery-powered alarm clock and use it. A late-night power surge has ruined many test days.

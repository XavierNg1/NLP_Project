 The sharper the scissors, the better the edge of the ribbon will be.;
, Snip the edge at a 45-degree angle, or cut it in an inverted “v” shape to discourage fraying.
 Use a good quality, trusted brand that you know encourages long wear.
 Wipe the brush on the top of the bottle to remove excess polish.
 You can either hold the ribbon in your hand and paint it at the very edge or lay it flat and paint one side, and then flip it and paint the other side.
, Try not to apply it in a thick coat or past the edge. It can make the ribbon look dark and wet if applied too heavily.


For best results test a piece of ribbon before you start to make sure it doesn’t ruin the surface.

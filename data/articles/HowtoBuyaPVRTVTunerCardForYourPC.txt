 If all you want to do is watch TV on your PC monitor or LCD display, you probably do not need to purchase a card that includes the specialized hardware accelerator chip used for PVR. If you want to pause live TV or record shows on your hard drive for future viewing or burning to CD, you should spend the extra $50-$75 to purchase a card that includes an MPEG-2 hardware accelerator.;
, If you don't mind opening the case of your PC to install a new PCI-based card, you will save $30-$50 buying a PCI version of the product. If you have a laptop or you would rather not open your PC (which in some cases voids the warranty), you should purchase a USB device. There is no difference in performance. (Note: this is not true of USB 1.x devices that have a paltry 1.5mb/sec bandwidth. Far too slow for high quality full screen video. Buy a USB 2.0 device if your PC supports it.)

, Once you have decided whether to purchase a PVR card vs a TV tuner, the hardware is very similar from product to product. The biggest difference will be the software interface you use to access the product. The main applications available are SnapStream Media Beyond TV, CyberLink PowerDVD and smaller generic programs. Beyond TV is the PC Magazine Editor's Choice award winner and is a superior product. Cyberlink is an acceptable all-purpose PVR application. Most generic 3rd party applications have limited functionality are less visually appealing.
 PVR products can range in price as much as 50% for the same technology. A PCI TV Tuner with no hardware acceleration should cost $50 or less. A PCI card with hardware PVR will cost from $99 to $149. The USB equivalents of each of these products will cost $30-$40 more. Just because a product costs more than another one does not necessarily mean it offers greater functionality, so read the labels carefully.

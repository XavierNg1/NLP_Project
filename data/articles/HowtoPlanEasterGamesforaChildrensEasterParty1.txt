 The games for a party are usually one of the last things to decide upon after you've worked out the time allotment, the catering, and the guests, etc. For an Easter party for children, it's a good idea to mix up games with an Easter egg hunt, some food at a sit-down area, and a bit of rest time as well.


If you can get hold of a good performer who is willing to dress up as Easter bunny, you can also get this person to perform a few tricks or some face-painting to stretch out the party activities, or to take care of those kids who don't want to participate in the games.
 When choosing a game, keep the following considerations in mind:


Is this game going to be age suitable for the children attending?
Is this game going to fit in with the time available?
Is this game going to give all the participants a chance to be a part of it?
Is this game going to fit in with the party theme overall?

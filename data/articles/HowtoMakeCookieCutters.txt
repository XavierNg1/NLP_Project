 Use a ruler and permanent marker to ensure that the edges are straight and uniform in size. Make the lines at least 1" (2.5cm) apart and use as much of the surface of the bottom of the pan as possible. You can also go to your local hardware store and buy sheet aluminum (22ga if they have it) if you don't want to cut up a lasagna pan.

, Next, cut out the strips that were drawn on the bottom of the pan. Be careful; cutting aluminum can leave sharp edges that can cause cuts and nicks on your fingers or hands. A good precaution is to wear gloves.
 Use ideas such as tracing a child's hand, hearts, stars, etc. Keep in mind that the perimeter of your cookie cutter can be no longer than your longest strip.









It may help to cut a piece of string the length of your strips and use it to measure around the perimeter of your design. Hold the string up to the strip and see if the strip is long enough.
Since you're working with metal, allow 1"-2" (2.5cm-5cm) of the strip for curves and to provide enough material to properly close your cookie cutters when you've finished shaping them.










To create curves, use pens or cups.
To create 90 degree angles, use table edges or a ruler.
To create other shapes, use anything interesting you have around the house––just be creative!

 You may fold over the edges (only about 1/8 inch/3.1mm) to provide a surface that will not be sharp and will not present a cutting hazard for your hands.









Wash and dry your cutter thoroughly before cutting out your cookie dough.

Beat for around three minutes. This is a fairly wet mixture and the beating is important.
Beat through enough to make a smooth batter but not too much that the air is taken out.
, Test by inserting a clean metal skewer into the centre of the cake and when the skewer is pulled out, it should be clean. If there is a sign of batter on the skewer, the cake is not fully cooked.


If the cake is still wet and/or moist when tested place back in the oven for another 5 - 10 minutes.

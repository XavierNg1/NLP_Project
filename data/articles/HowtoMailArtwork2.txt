 A mirror box is a thin, cardboard shipping box traditionally utilized for mailing mirrors, but fits artwork also.
 Use tissue paper to protect the delicate edges and the glass. Wrap the tissue paper around the entire frame. Tape the tissue paper securely.


Mirror boxes can be purchased at storage companies as well as furniture stores. Purchase one that is large enough to allow at least 3 inches (76.2 mm) of space between the edges of the frame and the box.
 Cover the entire frame with bubble wrap, paying special attention to the edges. Tape the bubble wrap edges closed.
 Lay the mirror box on its side and place packing peanuts inside.
 Place the bubble-wrapped artwork into the box on top of the first layer of packing peanuts.
 Use the packing peanuts, making sure that the edges of the artwork are not coming into contact with the box.

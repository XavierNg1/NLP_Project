 A white grease pencil works well for this. You will weld at the front and back of the subframe connectors. If you have end caps for your connectors, you will weld those on as well. It is also advised that you weld patches in regular intervals along the sides of your connectors., This can be done with a wire wheel attached to a drill. Strip all mounting points on the car and mounting plates on the connectors down to bare metal for welding., Just like with the bolt-on option, you will need your subframe connector to be in place along the frame rail. You can use a wooden block and a hydraulic jack to properly fit the subframe connector up against the frame rail..


If your connectors have a bolt-on option, bolt one side in to help hold the connector in place during welding.
 You need the metal of the frame rail to be close enough to the metal of the subframe connector to place sturdy welds. If you notice any gaps that you could slide the thickness of a nickel, you should measure them. If you have any ⅛-inch or larger gaps, you will need to readjust your subframe connectors to close those gaps before welding.
 You want to prevent the subframe connector from moving while you are welding it into place.The connector needs to be flush with the inner rail, but don't be concerned if the outer connector doesn't align with the body of the car., Welding the connector will take some time.


The weld needs to run around the connector mounting plates and the car’s subframe.If your connectors include end caps, secure the end caps and weld them in place as well.

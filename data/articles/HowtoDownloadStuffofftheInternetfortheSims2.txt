,, A dialog box will come up asking if you want to Open, Save or Cancel. Hit Save and save it to your desktop for now.
 In the box, there should be something telling you what type of file it is. It will either be .rar or .zip. This file type is a compressed version of the actual file, so it's quicker to download.



If you don't have a program to do this, you will need to download one. WinRar or 7Zip is good for Windows or Stuffit if you're on a Mac.
Right click on the file and extract it.



If you have a Windows XP, your Downloads folder is: Documents and Settings\(Current User Account)\My Documents\EA Games\The Sims 2\Downloads
If you have a Mac, the Downloads folder is: Users\(Current User Account)\Documents\EA Games\The Sims 2\Downloads
If you have Windows Vista, the Downloads folder is: Users\(Current User Account)\Documents\EA Games\The Sims 2\Downloads
If you don't have a downloads folder where it should be, simply make one. Remember, it has to be a capital D and end with an s.



If it's .PACKAGE, you don't have to do anything else.
If it's .JPG, .GIF, .PNG or some other file like that, it's probably just a picture to help remind you what object it is. You can delete this if you want.
If it's a .txt file, it's probably the creator's guidelines for what can and can't happen with their downloads, information about the object and/or instructions for how to get it to work with your game. You can delete this if you want, but it's good to hang on to.
If it's a .Sims2Pack, you can just click on it twice to install it.
 Your object should be there now!

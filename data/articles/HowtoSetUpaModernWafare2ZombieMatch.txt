 Don't invite strangers (They may mess up your fun) and once you get at least 4 or 5 people here's how you set it up;
, Then put HEADSHOT ONLY with KILL STREAKS DISABLED. The health needs to stay under DOUBLE because it will then require 2 knife hits to kill and I don't think an angry zombie getting constantly owned for 4 minutes then finally reaching them then dying again and not getting a kill is going to make them very happy. Disable spectating for the sake of cheating.
 RULES! RULES! IMPORTANT! Zombies may only knife! NOTHING ELSE! No special grenades or throwing knives or even a tactical insertion, ANYTHING LIKE THAT DISABLED! Humans may use everything all except for light machine guns except for the AUG HBAR. Shotguns are up to the host as they are a Classical zombie weapon. But they are also as well have way too much ammo even without scavenger. Secondary Launchers and things like that are enabled. Also, Heartbeats and Thermal Optics are disabled.
 BLUE PERKS that are disabled: One Man Army and Scavenger. RED PERKS that are disabled: LIGHTWEIGHT (Even for zombies) as it creates an extremely unfair advantage for survivors. GREEN PERKS that are disabled: COMMANDO (Even for Survivors) because again it creates unfair advantage to either side.
 This is kind of important because the spawning is not like free for all. You spawn nearby the enemies. The spawning on TDM is over halfway across the map. if there is 18 people then choose a big map and not rust lol seriously. if it's just 4 people, maybe Karachi or Invasion. Possibly rust???

, Make sure it is only copycat.

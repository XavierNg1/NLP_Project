 The mainstay of treatment is to increase your daily consumption of vitamin C, normally with a combination of dietary measures as well as vitamin C supplementation. Your doctor will give you guidance as to how much vitamin C you need to consume daily, depending upon the degree of deficiency you are currently experiencing. Typically, 120mg per day of vitamin C is recommended daily for the treatment of scurvy.Foods that are high in vitamin C include most fruits, many vegetables (particularly cabbage, spinach, and broccoli), and eating kidney or liver.
 In particular, eating disorders and alcoholism are commonly associated with scurvy. If this is the case, it is important to address and to treat these as well.
 Your doctor will prescribe an appropriate dosage if needed, depending upon the results of your blood test and the degree of deficiency that you are experiencing.
 Other symptoms may take a few weeks to show improvement. Scurvy can be effectively cured with proper adherence to your physician's treatment plan.

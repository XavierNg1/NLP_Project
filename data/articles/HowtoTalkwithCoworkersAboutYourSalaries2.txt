 The first step is just to broach the topic with the person. Obviously, you don't want to just demand to know their salary. Broach the topic more gently.You could say, "I'm trying to informally gather some information on salaries in the company, and I was wondering if you'd be willing to share yours."

, You may be able to convince people if you have an explicit reason for asking about salary. For instance, maybe you suspect you aren't making enough, or you maybe you think the company is discriminating against women and/or people of color.You could tell them, "I think I'm being underpaid for my work, and I'm wondering if it's systematic. I'd like to see how women are being paid in comparison to men in the company."
You could also offer to tell them your salary: "As a gesture of goodwill, I don't mind telling you my salary if you want to know."

, Another option is to do the work semi-anonymously. For instance, you could make a spreadsheet that you pass around to coworkers with different people adding their information. With this method, disclosing salaries could be done somewhat anonymously, as employees would not need to give their names.However, in a small company, it would be difficult to keep people anonymous. Nonetheless, a spreadsheet you pass around is a good way to collect the information for everyone.
 If someone doesn't want to share their information, you should let it go. Pushing someone to share will only cause more tension, and they are more likely to report you to management.

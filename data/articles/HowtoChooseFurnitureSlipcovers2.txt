Select something that is easy to wash if you have children, pets or eat on your furniture frequently. The best fabrics for this lifestyle include cotton, denim or corduroy.
Remember that thin, stretchy material which is often made from polyester will fit your furniture easily, but will be less durable than a thicker fabric.
Choose a fabric such as micro-suede, chintz, chenille or imitation leather for furniture that gets less traffic. You will not have to worry about removing and washing these slipcovers as often.
 Whether you are choosing a slipcover for the living room, bedroom or home office, you want your furniture to match the rest of your decoration.


Look for bright colors and patterns for kids rooms, play areas and places where the entire family gathers.
Go with more traditional shades and simple patterns in formal rooms such as dining rooms, living rooms and libraries.
Consider white slipcovers. While that color may seem counterintuitive, especially if you have kids, pets and lots of messes, you can bleach the white fabric when you wash it.
 You do not want to struggle every time you put the slipcover on or take it off.


Look for a one-piece slipcover if you want low maintenance. The more pieces a slipcover has, the more difficult it can be getting everything in place.
Try a slipcover with tailored pleats or pretty folds if you want a unique and special appearance, and you do not plan to take it off very often to wash or change it.

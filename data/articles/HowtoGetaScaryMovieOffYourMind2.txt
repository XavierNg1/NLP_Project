 Horror movies always seem scarier at night. Watching a scary movie and then walking out into broad daylight will not have the same effect on you as watching a movie at midnight. If you are going to the movie theater, choose a movie that ends before the sun goes down.


If the movie is coming on television, DVR or record the movie and watch it at another time.Watching a scary movie earlier in the day also gives you time to do other activities before you go to bed.
 Knowing that you are in a safe environment causes you to be scared in a fun way instead of experiencing true fear.If you feel safe, your brain recognizes that you are not in true danger and allows you to enjoy the scary movie.Watching a scary movie in a movie theater is usually a better experience than watching the movie at home.After the movie is over, you are able to leave the environment completely.


If you find yourself getting too caught up in the movie, go to the bathroom or get a snack to give your mind a break.
Watch scary movies with other people instead of sitting in the dark by yourself and watching the movie.
 People are afraid of different things. While flesh eating zombies may scare you, a serial killer on the run may terrify someone else. People are often more fearful of movies that they can identify with. Figure out the things that scare you the most and avoid those types of scary movies.


For example, if you babysit a lot, a scary movie about breaking into a home while babysitting may really get to you and cause you to be paranoid the next time you babysit.
When you know your limits, you have greater control over how the movie will affect you.

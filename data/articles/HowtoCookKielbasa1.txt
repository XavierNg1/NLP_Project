 Biała kiełbasa (BEEYAH-wah keeyehw-BAH-sah) is usually white in color. Because it is raw, it needs to be cooked first. After it is cooked, you can serve it as is, or you can bake, grill, or fry it to further improve its flavor.


If you have dried kiełbasa, such as kabanos, you do not need to cook it. Simply slice it up, and eat it on its own, or add it to a sandwich.
If you have kiełbasa zwyczajna (keeyehw-BAH-sah zvih-CHAI-nah), or "regular" kiełbasa, you do not need to cook it, although it is highly recommended that you do to kill off any potential bacteria.You can bake it, fry it, or grill it.;
, The pot needs to be wide enough to comfortably fit the kiełbasa without cramming it in. If you are cooking a lot of kiełbasa, it might be a good idea to cook it in several batches. Store your extra kiełbasa in the fridge while you cook it.
 How much water you use depends on the size of your saucepan and the thickness of the kiełbasa.
 Let the water simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, or until the kiełbasa's temperature reaches between 168 and 174°F (76 and 79°C). You can test the temperature with a meat thermometer

, Once your kiełbasa is cooked, you can toss it into żurek (a popular soup served during Easter in Poland), or you can heat it up by baking, frying, or grilling.

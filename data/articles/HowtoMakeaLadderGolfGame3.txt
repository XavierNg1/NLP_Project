 Each team should get 12 bolas to throw (if you bought 24 golf balls), and each team should use a different-colored bola.
 This can be as far away as you'd like. For official ladder golf, it's 15 feet (4.6 m).
 That is, Team 1 will throw 3 bolas, then Team 2 will throw 3 bolas.
 The usual ladder golf scoring is as follows, though you can adjust it however you want:


Top rung = 3 points
Middle rung = 2 points
Bottom rung = 1 points

, If you can unseat the other team's bola from a rung, then their points are deducted for that throw.
 The first team to score 21 points without going over wins.
 To make the game move more quickly for younger players, bump up the point value of each rung by 1 point. You could also move the throw line closer to the ladder.

 You don't need to fill the saucepan with water, an inch or two will be enough to create steam.;
, To serve four people, you will need about 1 1/2 lbs of carrots. Wash the carrots thoroughly in cold water to remove any remaining dirt or pesticides. Chop off the stems of the carrots with a small knife, then peel them using a vegetable peeler. You can then cut up the carrots any way you like: you can leave them whole, slice or dice them, or cut them into rounds.
 If you don't have a steamer basket, a colander that sits comfortably into the saucepan will also work.
 Make sure the water does not reach the bottom of the steamer basket. If the carrots are immersed in water they will be boiled, rather than steamed., Use a lid to cover the saucepan, but don't cover it completely. Leave a small gap on one side to allow the steam to vent.
 This should take 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the size of the chunks.


You can check the carrots for doneness by sticking a fork into them. If it slides in easily, the carrots are done.
Although this is the recommended cooking time, you can steam the carrots for as long or short a time as you want, depending on whether you like your carrots very soft or extremely crisp.
,, While the carrots are still hot, you can mix in any flavors of your choice. They work very well drizzled with a teaspoon of melted butter, or quickly sauteed with a little olive oil, some garlic and a squeeze of lemon juice. And don't forget the salt and pepper.

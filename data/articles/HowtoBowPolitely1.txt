 Bowing is typically used in Asian cultures to show respect, honor, or gratitude. A silent bow often replaces the phrase "Thank you." In Asian cultures, you should bow from the hip with your head pointed down. Polite bowing is still common in many Asian countries, but it is not practiced as strictly in America.


Bowing is prevalent to varying degrees in many East Asian countries, but it is most prominent in China, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Vietnam. Various nuanced bows are used to express apologies, gratitude, sincerity, deference, and remorse, among other things.
The handshake has become a common greeting in many East Asian cultures, particularly in business circles. Bowing may not be appropriate when you first meet someone—especially if he or she is a peer—but it can be a versatile way to convey more complex emotions. A slight bow to show courtesy is usually welcome.;
, Stand straight with your feet together, forming a V with your heels. Clench your hands at your sides, but not too tight.
 Bend at the waist, but keep your back straight. Open your hands as you bend. Bring your feet together., If you are bowing to an elder, a superior, or someone you respect, look down at their feet when you bow. If you're bowing to someone who does not fit into any of these categories, feel free to look them directly in the eye.Bear in mind that if you look someone in the eyes, it may be taken as a sign of disrespect. This is especially the case when bowing to older, more traditionally-minded people, especially those who grew up steeped in an East Asian culture. Carefully consider the situation, and be mindful of who you are bowing to.
 Straighten up, close your hands, and split your feet back into the V. Feel free to make eye contact with the person to whom you bowed.

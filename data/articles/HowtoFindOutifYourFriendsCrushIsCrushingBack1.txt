 The easiest and most effective way is to just ask your friend's crush about their feelings. If you're having trouble working up the courage to ask such a personal question, there's a few ways to make the process easier.


Consider the time and place you're going to have the conversation. Make sure the crush is in a comfortable area, probably out of earshot from anyone who could listen in.
Be gentle. Don't use confrontational lines, such as "Everyone knows you like Ryan. Just come out and say it!" Instead, you might say "You seem really happy around Ryan. Do you think you might have feelings for him?"
Don't pry too much if they seem uncomfortable. If the crush seems to get embarrassed during your conversation, back off a bit. They may need time before they're willing to divulge such sensitive feelings. ;
, Instead of asking the crush directly about your friend, try starting with their love life in general. Ask to see if they're dating anyone or if they're currently looking to find a love interest.
 Ask your friend's crush less leading questions about your friend, and see if they naturally bring up their potential attraction. Try questions such as, "So how did you and Cayla meet?" or "How long have you known each other?"

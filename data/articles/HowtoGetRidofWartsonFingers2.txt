 Your doctor can suggest the use of prescription chemical treatments to try to kill off the skin cells of the warts. These treatments usually contain chemicals such as formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and silver nitrate.


The side effects of these chemical treatments include the skin around the wart being stained brown, and burns to the skin surrounding the wart.Your doctor may also suggest prescription-strength wart medication that contains salicylic acid. This medication will remove layers of the wart over time and is often more effective when used in combination with freezing or cryotherapy.
 Cryotherapy is a procedure where your doctor applies liquid nitrogen to your wart, which causes a blister to form under and around your wart. The dead tissue can then be removed seven to ten days after the freezing. However, this method can trigger your immune system to fight viral warts and you may need repeat treatments done to remove the wart completely.Cryotherapy sessions usually take five to 15 minutes and can be painful. If the warts on your hands are large, they may need to be frozen several times before they are fully removed.
There are several side effects of cryotherapy, including pain, blistering, and discolored skin around the wart.
 Your doctor may suggest that you try pulse-dye laser treatment to burn off tiny blood vessels in the wart. The infected tissue will then die and the wart will fall off.Keep in mind the effectiveness of this method is limited. It can also cause pain and scarring around the affected area.

 Toddlers may be young, but they do have a good idea of what types of things they are interested in. Ask your toddler if they would like to try a sport, and consider their answers seriously.You can say, “If you could play any sport, what would you choose?”
You can also give the toddler options. For example, you might say, “Do you want to take karate or would you rather learn soccer?”;
, If your toddler does not have an opinion on what sport they like, observe how they play on the playground. Take note of what type of play they enjoy, and find an activity that suits it.


If they like running, they may want to join some kind of running sport like tag or racing.
If they like tumbling, they may enjoy gymnastics.
If they throw things often, you might want to put them in a sport like t-ball.
 Toddlers are still growing, and they may not be ready for certain sports. Introducing a child too young to rough sports can cause lifelong injuries. Contact sports, such as football and hockey, should not be introduced until the child is in middle school.Some good sports and activities for toddlers include:


Relay Racing
T-ball
Tag
Frisbee
Skiing

, The structure of a team sport may be overwhelming for a toddler. These sports, such as basketball or soccer, may not be appropriate for a child until they are six or seven years old. Instead, find sports that offer more free play and that can be taught to your toddler individually.These include:


Gymnastics
Swimming
Golf
Tennis

, You might find that your child acts differently during a sports lesson than they would while playing at home in the park. It may take a few tries to find the right sport for your child. Don’t be afraid to try some different options.After each lesson, ask your toddler, “How was it? Did you have fun? What did you do?”
Do not invest in equipment until you are positive that your child enjoys the sport. This will prevent you from buying equipment that will later be unused.

 If you’re getting into bread baking or pastry making and you want to make sure you’re measuring flour accurately, it’s worth it to invest in a kitchen scale. That’s because even the scoop and level method isn’t as accurate as weighing the flour to make sure it comes out to the right weight. Since being off by even half an ounce can make a difference in the outcome of your baked goods, using a scale is the top choice for serious bakers.
 A cup of white, unbleached flour comes out to approximately four and a quarter ounces, but other flours have different weights. If you're working with whole wheat flour, self-rising flour or another type of flour, find out exactly how much a cup should weigh. Here are the weights of commonly used specialty flours:Cake flour: 1 cup = 4 ounces
Self-rising flour: 1 cup = 4 ounces
Whole wheat flour: 1 cup = 4 ounces
Whole wheat pastry flour: 1 cup = 3 3/8 ounces

, If your recipe calls for 2 1/2 cups of white flour, for example, you'll need to figure out how many ounces that comes to. Do the math in your head or use a calculator to figure out how much you need to weigh out.
 Since whatever container you’re using to hold the flour shouldn’t count toward the weight of the flour, you have to subtract its weight from the final amount. You can do this by using your scale to "zero out" the weight of the container.


If you're using a mechanical scale, turn the knob back to the zero mark with the container on the scale.If you're using a digital scale, hit the “clear” button with the container on the scale.
 Once the container's weight has been zeroed out, you can add your flour. Scoop it into the container until the correct weight is reached. If you're using regular white flour, it should come to 4.25 ounces per cup. If you're using another flour, double check to see how much a cup should weigh.

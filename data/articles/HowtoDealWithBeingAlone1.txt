Try setting aside about 30 minutes per day to be alone and do something that you want to do. It might feel strange to plan alone time at first, but over time it will become easier and you may even begin to look forward to it.Try setting aside a specific block of time that you will spend by yourself. For example, you might decide that you are going to spend some time alone from 5:30-6:00pm every evening.
Decide what you want to do during your alone time as well. If you are not sure what you want to do, you can start with something simple like taking a walk around your neighborhood or going to a coffee shop by yourself to read.;

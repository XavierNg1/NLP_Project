 You’ll only need a long nose pliers for this. If you don’t have one, you can purchase it for under $5 from your local hardware store.


You can also use any item with a durable, pointed metal tip if you don’t want to spend money on the tool.;
, Take your Beats by Dre headphone and expose the hinges by extending the ear muffs away from the headband.
 Right on the point where the arms of the ear muffs are joining the headband, you’ll see a short metal rod. This is the pin of the hinge.
 Get your long nose pliers and gently lift the both ends of the metal rod/pin towards the headband one at a time. This will tighten the hinge and keep it from wiggling around.


Be careful not to damage the metal arm where the pin is place and the plastic part of the headband. Bend only the tip of the pin and not its entire body. Don’t pull the pin off of the metal arm too. Do the same to other arm if it’s also loose.
 Pull the ear muffs away from the headband and extend it as long as it can go.
 Spread out the earmuffs away from the body as if you’re going to put it on. Hold it by the headband and gently shake it to see if the headphone will hold its position.
 If the earmuffs fold back into position just by gently shaking it, repeat Part 1 and tighten the Beats by Dre a little bit more.

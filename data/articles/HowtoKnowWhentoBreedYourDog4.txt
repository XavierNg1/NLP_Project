 Once a female enters heat, male dogs will be drawn the hormones and pheromones she secretes in her urine. You may notice that male dogs give her more attention at the dog park or that you have stray dogs hanging around your home. Initially, the female will ignore the males but, once she enters estrus, she will allow them to breed with her.If you want the female to breed with a certain male, do not allow her around any other male dogs during estrus.
Increased male attention is a great way to determine if your female is a “silent heater.” This female dog goes through heat and produces hormones, but does not develop any of the external indicators.
 Male dogs will fight over the female and become more aggressive when around her. If you own multiple dogs, you may notice that the males become territorial and aggressive towards each other while the female is in heat. They will also be more aggressive towards other males that they encounter and possibly fight over the female., If you own a male and female dog, you may notice a dramatic change in behavior. Your male dog may begin to pay the female more attention. He may also whimper and become irritable if you separate him from the female. If your male dog begins to show signs of separation anxiety towards the female, the female is likely in heat.

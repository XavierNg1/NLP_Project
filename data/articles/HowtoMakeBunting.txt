 Draw a triangle measuring 20 centimeter (7.9 in) wide by 20 centimeter (7.9 in) deep, then cut it out.
 If using a tea-towel, use the hemmed edge as the top edge of the triangle (this will save you having to create your own hem).
,, Use either glue, tape, or thread depending on your material.









Use a standard straight stitch to sew the flags to the ribbon.
If you did not use the ready-made edge from the tea-towel fabric, fold the material under at the top edge, and sew onto the ribbon.
, Keep going until you have finished sewing all the pieces onto the ribbon. Make sure you leave a longer gap at either end, so that you have enough ribbon to tie up your bunting. Using a sewing machine is quicker, but you could do this by hand.









Give the pieces a quick iron if you're using cloth.

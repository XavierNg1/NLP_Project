 Don’t go into a conversation with a preconceived opinion about what the speaker will be saying. When you go in with your opinion formed, you are prepared to talk instead of listen. Open your mind to the information that the speaker will be giving you and you will be forced to listen more than you talk., If it is appropriate, use the information that you learned from the speaker during a future conversation. This will allow the speaker to know that you were listening to them last time you had a conversation. It will make them feel important and respected. More importantly, you can show that you were really listening even by saying very little from your previous conversation.For example, you are listening to a co-worker talk about a new great restaurant in town. After you try the restaurant tell your co-worker, “I tried that new restaurant that you recommended. It was great! Thanks for the recommendation.”

, If the speaker is telling a story, try to really picture and feel what the speaker has to say. If the speaker is talking about something sad, feel their sadness. If the speaker is talking about something happy, feel their joy. This will allow you to be a more active listener and will help you to remember what the speaker is saying., Silence in a conversation is not always a bad thing. Just because there has been a moment of silence, doesn’t mean that you need to fill it with words. A break in the conversation could allow for more thought before the conversation resumes. Be comfortable with the silence and use this time to feel and comprehend what the speaker what telling you., Only speak when you have something new and insightful to add to the conversation. Instead of responding as soon as there is a break in conversation, pause for a moment and think about whether you need to say anything. Even if you do, the pause can show that you are listening and help you talk a little less.

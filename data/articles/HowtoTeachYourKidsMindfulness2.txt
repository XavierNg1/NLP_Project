 During your family practice, have your children sit or lay down on the floor. Then, instruct them that you are going to make a sound with a ringing instrument and that they should listen carefully until they no longer hear the chime. You can also make it game like by having the children raise their hands once they no longer hear the sound.To make the sound, you should consider using a singing bowl, bell, set of chimes, or another ringing instrument.
 Have your children sit or lay on the floor with their eyes closed. In a gentle tone, begin guiding them through their body’s efforts to relax. Start with the head and neck, moving to the fingers and toes. By listening to your voice, this will help your children focus their attention. It will also help them become more familiar with feeling their body relax.When you are guiding your children, say things like “Feel your neck relax” and “Now, feel the tension leave your fingertips.”
You can also guide your children through an imaginary peaceful place, such as a garden or a park, and describe how scenic it is.
 Have your children jump up and down in place for a few moments. Then, tell them to lay or sit down and put their hands on their heart. Have them close their eyes and concentrate on their heartbeat and breath. Instruct them to think about any other sensations that they feel at the moment.This exercise is also useful for practicing breath awareness.

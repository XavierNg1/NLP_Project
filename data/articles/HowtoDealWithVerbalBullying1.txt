 Also be aware that you do live within a cultural time that values competitiveness as a virtue. One unfortunate side effect of that pressure to always perform, succeed and be some sort of ultimate is that some people feel that bullying is an okay way to behave. It's never okay and fortunately, there are ways to manage the situation to allow you to cope and even thrive despite the bullying person or culture to which you're being subjected.;
, The concept that someone has been bullied because of some weakness or inability to show grit in the face of witty barbs is born from the opinion of bullies themselves, the people who would like to excuse this disgusting behavior as "normal". Human beings are meant to get along with one another to ensure the species' survival, which does not mean spending inordinate amounts of time tearing one another down. You do not have to change who you are to satisfy the odd insecurities or failures of the bully. What you do need to do is find ways to manage this person effectively, so that he or she isn't constantly dragging you down.

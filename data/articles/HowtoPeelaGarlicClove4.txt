 This is a great method for pealing an entire head of garlic at once. Remove whatever loose papery skin you can by hand before beginning.
 Place the bowls together, open side to open side, to form a larger 'sealed' bowl.
 Let the garlic clang around inside the bowls for 1-2 minutes, shaking vigorously.
 You should be left with the individual cloves, which will likely still be covered in skin. Remove the skins and the hard bottom chunk of the bulb and throw them in the compost or trash. Then reseal the bowls.
 You may have to pick off some of the finer, thinner skins by hand, or use another method to remove the individual clove skins, such as soaking the cloves in water in the stainless steel bowl. However, with enough shaking the majority of skins should fall off on their own.

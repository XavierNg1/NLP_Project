 In order to get Eevee to evolve into either Espeon or Umbreon, you'll need to raise its Friendship level to at least 220. A common way to increase Friendship is to just keep Eevee in your party as you walk around. You'll gain 1 Friendship every 512 steps you take in the game.
 Talk to the younger Haircut Brother in the Goldenrod Tunnel. You can get a haircut once every 24 hours for up to a 10 point Friendship gain., Talk to Daisy in Pallet Town between 3 and 4 PM to get Eevee groomed. This will give Eevee a 3 point Friendship boost., Several items that you can give your Pokémon are considered "Vitamins." Give any of these to Eevee for a gain of 3 to 5 Friendship points:

HP Up
Protein
Iron
Calcium
Carbos
PP Up
Rare Candy

, Leveling up Eevee in battle or with a Rare Candy will give you a boost of 5 points if your friendship is less than 100. It will give you 3 points if its Friendship is between 100 and 200. It will gain 2 points if its Friendship is above 200., Having Eevee in your party when you challenge a Gym leader will give you a boost of 1-3 points., If Eevee faints in battle, it will lose 1 Friendship point. Make sure to swap it out if it gets low on health. Don't use any healing items either (see the next step)., Healing items will significantly lower Eevee's Friendship rating. Avoid the following items and do all of your healing at the nearest Pokémon Center.

Energy Powder (-5 Friendship)
Heal Powder (-5 Friendship)
Energy Root (-10 Friendship)
Revival Herb (-15 Friendship).
 Put Eevee at the front of your party and talk to the lady in the house to the east of the Goldenrod City Department Store. The phrase she says will indicate your Eevee's general Friendship level.

50 - 99: "You should treat it better. It's not used to you."
100 - 149: "It's quite cute."
150 - 199: "It's friendly toward you. Sort of happy."
200 - 249: "I get the feeling it really trusts you."
250 - 255: "It looks really happy! It must love you a lot."

, Once you think that your Eevee is above 220 Friendship, level it up in the day time to get Espeon, or level it up at night to get Umbreon. You can level up Eevee through battle or by using a Rare Candy. If it doesn't evolve, its Friendship is not at 200 or above yet.

Day time is 4:00 AM - 5:59 PM.
Night time is 6:00 PM - 3:59 AM.

 Place all the ice cubes into a Lewis bag. A Lewis bag was originally intended as a coin purse, but now enjoys larger popularity as a venue in which to crush ice. If you don't have a Lewis bag (they are fairly cheap), you can also use a clean pillowcase.The Lewis bag will do quite well for larger quantities of ice. A small sealable plastic bag will only fit enough for one or two cocktails. A Lewis bag, on the other hand, is ideal for making 5+ cocktails at once.
 Again, nice and easy does it. A lot of the moisture from the ice will get absorbed into the Lewis bag, leaving you with a drier ice â€” ideal for cocktails.

 Wear a loose top, so it won't matter if it gets stretched out from try-on sessions. Wear stretchy trousers so that you can take them off easily in the changing room, and comfortable shoes. Try to wear something that you want to be seen in so you won't be hiding all day, something that makes you confident with yourself.;
, Make sure you are prepared for your shopping spree. In the bag, you should have your purse, mobile, any makeup or brushes you carry around, an umbrella in case the weather turns bad, a small mirror to check your make up, a bottle of water and maybe even a camera! Preferably a handbag with long straps to throw over your shoulder!

,, It is a good idea to have a vague idea of what you would like to buy and where you would like to look.
 Trying on clothes is always good fun, especially when you find the perfect outfit. Make sure your clothes fit well, this is were the honest friend comes in! Make sure you look great, to you and your friend. Your clothes should look better than the clothes you came in! If they do, check that the price is reasonable and buy it!

, If you don't, you will be moaning by the end of the day. But don't eat too much; that could also have you moaning at the end of the day!

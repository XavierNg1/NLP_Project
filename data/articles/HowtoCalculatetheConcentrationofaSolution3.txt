 Use this method if you're asked to find the "percent composition" or "weight percent."In chemistry, you are most often interested in the mass of a substance. Once you know how the masses of the solute and the solvent, you can find the percentage of the solute fairly easily by comparing the two amounts.



Example problem: 10 grams of chocolate powder are dissolved in 1.2 Liters of hot water. First, calculate what percentage of the solution is chocolate. Then write the result in parts per million.
 If any measurements you are given are written in volume measurements (such as liters or milliliters), you'll need to convert them to a unit of mass: grams. Because each substance has a certain density (mass per volume), you'll need to find out the specific characteristics of the substance before you can do this:


Look up the density of the substance in your textbook or online. Convert the density so it is written in grams per (the unit of volume used in the problem), if it isn't already. Multiply the density by the volume of the substance and you'll have the mass in grams.

Example: You have 1.2 Liters of water. The density of water is 1000 grams per liter, so calculate (1000 g / 1 L) x 1.2 L = 1200 grams.
Since our solute, the chocolate, is already measured in grams, we don't need to convert it.
 Once you have the mass of the solute and the mass of the solvent, both in grams, use this formula to calculate the percent composition: (grams of solute (in g) / (grams of solute + grams of solvent)) x 100.


We have 10 grams of chocolate, and we figured out that there are 1200 grams of water. The entire solution (solute + solvent) has a mass of 10 + 1200 = 1210 grams.
The concentration of the chocolate in the entire solution = (10 grams chocolate) / (1210 grams solution) = 0.00826
Multiply this by 100 to get the percentage: 0.00826 x 100 = 0.826, so the mixture is 0.826% chocolate.
 Percentage is really "parts per hundred" so parts per million is calculated a very similar way. The formula is (grams of solute (in g) / (grams of solute + grams of solvent)) x 1,000,000. In scientific notation, this is written (grams of solute (in g) / (grams of solute + grams of solvent)) x 106.


In our example, (10 grams chocolate) / (1210 grams solution) = 0.00826.
0.00826 x 106 = 8260 parts per million chocolate.
Normally, parts per million is used to measure much smaller concentrations, which are less convenient to write as percentages. We're just using the same example here for convenience.

 Many women are accidentally buying a bra size that's too small or too big. The wrong sized bra can cause your breasts to look smaller or misshapen. When you go shopping for a bra, be aware of the size you need.


Cup size is not necessarily the best measure of bra size. Cup size is correlated with band size. If you're an A-cup with a 34 inch band, you may be a B-cup with a 32 inch band. Learn your band size and then find a cup size from there.Go to a store that specializes in selling bras, lingerie, and other underwear. Ask for a fitting. A good saleswoman will be able to help find you a bra that's flattering on you.;
, Push-up and padded bras are two types of bra that are specially designed to enhance the size of your breasts. If you want to enhance the size of your breasts, consider investing in a push-up or padded bra.


Push-up bras are designed to lift the breasts up and push them closer together, creating the appearance of larger breasts. Push-up bras are sold at most department stores as well as stores that specialize in lingerie.
Padded bras contain extra foam padding in the cups, which makes breasts look rounder and fuller without creating extra cleavage.
 No bra is universally flattering. A low-cut dress might benefit from your breasts looking perkier, but a t-shirt might be better worn if your breasts are softer and flatter.

Therefore, you should work on taking care of the bras you have so they do not wear out too fast.

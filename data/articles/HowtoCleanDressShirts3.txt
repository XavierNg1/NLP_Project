 Even when you go to a "dry cleaner," dry cleaning is not the only service they provide. For a typical cotton dress shirt, a wash and press is in many ways your better option. The cleaner will wash your shirt in a typical washing machine, then place it in a clothing press which removes the water and irons the shirt., Of course, dry cleaning is still an option. Unfortunately, dry cleaning will not remove water-based stains (such as sweat), but it will eradicate oil stains. If you have gotten something oily on your shirt, dry cleaning is the way to go., Bring your shirt to the cleaner of your choice and explain which service you'd like to have done. The cleaner will tell you when to return to pick up your shirt. In most cases, you will pay when you retrieve the shirt, but some locations may ask you to pay before service are rendered.

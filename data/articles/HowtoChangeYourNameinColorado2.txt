 If you are filing for divorce or legal separation, the relevant forms will present you with the option of restoring your name to your prior full name (i.e. your name before marriage).
 In a Petition for Dissolution of Marriage or Legal Separation (available for download here), Question 20 deals with name restorations. If you wish to restore your name to your prior full name, fill in this blank.
 Note that in a petition for dissolution of marriage or legal separation in Colorado, it is only possible to restore your name to your prior full name. If you wish to adopt a new name, you must file a petition for a Decree of Name Change and follow all the necessary steps required of that process. These steps include requesting a criminal background check from the FBI and the CBI and completing the necessary forms. For more information, visit this website.
 If you choose the option of restoring your name to your prior full name in your dissolution of marriage or legal separation petition, your final certified dissolution or separation decree may serve as evidence of your name change. Visit the local offices of government agencies (e.g. the SSA) and private institutions (e.g. banks) to change your name in their records.


Begin by changing your name with the Social Security Administration (SSA) by visiting your nearest SSA Office and present your divorce or separation decree as evidence that you have legally changed your name. You are required to change your name with the SSA before visiting the Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV).Your decree may also be presented as evidence of your name change to the Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in order to obtain a new license or ID card that reflects your new name. Note that the Colorado DMV requires that all name changes are on file with the SSA before visiting the DMV office, and that it may take at least 24 business hours for your name change to reflect in the SSA records.

 A way you can treat your leg acne is to use an acne prevention or treatment cleanser. An acne cleansing wash contains acne-fighting medication to help heal and prevent pimples.You can find many acne body washes and soaps available to buy. If you cannot find one, you can try a wash for facial acne on your legs.
Make sure the cleanser has benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or alpha hydroxy acids.
If you have sensitive skin, use a 2.5% concentration of benzoyl peroxide or lower., Many creams and spot treatments are aimed to help prevent and treat acne. These creams are supposed to be used directly on the pimple, or smeared over the area with a high concentration of acne. Many of these creams and spot treatments have a higher concentration of medication.Most creams or spot treatments will not be labeled for use on the legs; however, any acne product for the body can be used on your legs.
Make sure the creams or spot treatments have benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or alpha hydroxy acids. Benzoyl peroxide is usually the most effective over-the-counter product for leg acne.
If over-the-counter creams don’t work, your doctor may prescribe stronger ointments, including antibiotic ointments.
You can try acne creams, acne pads to wipe across on your legs, or other spot treatments.
 Most people will see a reduction of their leg acne within a few weeks. If you see no improvements in your leg acne within a few weeks, make an appointment with your dermatologist to explore other medications or approaches that may be needed.


Although this may seem slow, you can’t rush the healing process. Trying to rush it may cause scarring or make your skin worse.
Your dermatologist may prescribe stronger medication for you. Topical treatments include retinoids and antibiotics, while common oral treatments include antibiotics, oral contraceptives, an anti-adrogen agent, and isotretinoin.

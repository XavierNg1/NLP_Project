 On a smartphone, burst mode is equivalent to a DSLR camera’s high speed shooting mode. When in burst mode setting, you can take multiple pictures of the same subject every second (approximately 10 to 20 frames per second), which greatly increases your likelihood of capturing a fantastic action shot. There are several ways to access this setting:


If you have an iPhone or Samsung galaxy, focus on your subject while holding down the onscreen shutter button (located near the bottom of the screen). Once you let go of the button, your smartphone will stop capturing images.
If you have an iPhone, you may also also hold down the volume-up button (located on the side of your phone). Once you let go of the button, your smartphone will stop capturing images.
If you can not access burst mode by holding down the shutter button, your smartphone may either require you to manually switch into burst mode or may not support burst mode., Some smartphone cameras are now equipped with the technology to automatically track and focus on a subject. This new mode, called Tracking AF, is available on Galaxy S6, S6 edge, and S6 edge+ phones. To activate this mode:


Launch your smartphone’s camera
Open up your camera’s settings
Turn on the Tracking AF, It is possible to take captivating actions shots with your point-and-shoot digital camera. Instead of attempting to snap action shots in the default mode, switch your camera into sports mode. Once in sports mode, your camera automatically engages a continuous focus setting and its shutter speed also increases.This setting is also known as action mode.

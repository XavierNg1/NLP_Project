 Fashion boots come in a variety of heel thicknesses, heel heights, and boot heights. A boot that extends just above your ankle looks classic and works well with both pants and skirts. A narrow heel with a little height also has a timeless, versatile appeal.
 Knee-high boots and boots that extend past the knee work best for outfits that permit them to be seen. Wear them with skirts or over skinny jeans.
 Chunky heels have a heavy look to them, but coordinate well with heavier fall clothing like corduroy pants or sweaters.
 Boots may be a highly fashionable autumn item, but heels and flats still work well for fall. These styles transcend the season.
 Sandals call to mind the warmer seasons of spring and summer. They often clash with many of the materials associate with fall clothing.

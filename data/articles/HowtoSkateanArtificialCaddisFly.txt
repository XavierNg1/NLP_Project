 This may be an "Elk Hair Caddis" which more precisely imitates the caddisfly natural, or a "Stimulator" type fly which is a general attractor pattern that is high-floating and easy to skitter across the water.
 You'll want to be no more than a short cast's length from the spot you think will produce a fish, because the more line you have out the harder the fly is to control when skittering., You want the fly to reach the end of the cast at a point where the fish are between you and the fly at a downstream angle across the creek.,, This will translate into the fly skipping and skittering across the surface if done properly. You may have to adjust your movements of the rod tip to match the speed of the current in the water, or the wind or several other factors. Practice will help you master the proper amount of pressure and movement needed in any given situation., You are not trying to skitter the fly all the way back to your position - but only to skitter it across the creek over waiting fish. Often, the "takes" are violent and occasionally the fish will come completely out of the water chasing the skittered caddis imitation. Skittering imitates a female caddis laying her eggs on the stream. The caddis dips down and does "touch and go" landings, each time depositing eggs into the water. The fish see these caddis as an easy meal about to escape, and will often chase the skittered fly because of instinct, when they are not actively feeding otherwise., If no trout chase or hit the fly after a few attempts, move downstream by taking two or three steps and repeating the process over a slightly new section of water., So, most of the time you only need to be concerned with being ready for the trout to hit the fly. Then, hold on and play the fish normally until it tires and is ready to be landed.

 If your skin is fair, thin, or aging, it's especially prone to sun damage. When your skin is weak, capillaries are more likely to become dilated and visible on the surface of your skin. Be sure to wear sunscreen each time you go out in the sun. In strong sun, wear a hat and sunglasses for extra protection.The sun's UV rays can cause damage in the winter, not just the summer. Wear sunscreen all year round.
Avoid windburn as well. Wear a scarf around your face if you know you'll be exposed to high winds.
 Many have reported that consuming alcohol increases the number of broken capillaries on the skin. The alcohol causes the skin to become red and to swell slightly, leading to a higher instance of damage. Be sure not to overindulge in alcohol, and switch drinks if you notice one in particular causing unflattering results. Red wine, in particular, is said to cause inflammation.
 The circulatory system is quite responsive to temperature changes. Your capillaries constrict and expand depending on the temperature, and extreme temperatures can cause more broken capillaries to occur. When you must be exposed to extreme heat or cold, be sure to protect your face so it doesn't come into direct contact with freezing cold or very hot air.


At home, keep the thermostat steady so the temperature in your house doesn't rise or fall too much.
Use lukewarm water when you wash your face, rather than using very hot or very cold water.

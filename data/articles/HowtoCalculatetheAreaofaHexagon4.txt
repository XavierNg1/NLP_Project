 If you know you're working with a regular hexagon that is missing one or more of its triangles, then the first thing you need to do is find the area of the entire regular hexagon as if it were whole. Then, simply find the area of the empty or "missing" triangle, and that subtract that from the overall area. This will give you the area of the remaining irregular hexagon.


For example, if you've found that the area of the regular hexagon is 60 cm2 and you've found that the area of the missing triangle is 10 cm2 simply subtract the area of the missing triangle from the entire area: 60 cm2 - 10 cm2 = 50 cm2.
If you know that the hexagon is missing exactly one triangle, you can also just find the area of the hexagon by multiplying the total area by 5/6, since the hexagon is retaining the area of 5 of its 6 triangles. If it's missing two triangles, you can multiply the total area by 4/6 (2/3), and so on.
 You may find that the irregular hexagon is actually composed of four triangles that are irregularly shaped. To find the area of the whole irregular hexagon, you need to find the area of each individual triangle and then add them up. There are a variety of ways to find the area of a triangle depending on the information that you have.
 If you can't simply pick apart a few triangles, look through the irregular hexagon to see if you can locate other shapes -- maybe a triangle, a rectangle, and/or a square. Once you've outlined the other shapes, just find their areas and add them up to get the area of the entire hexagon.


One type of irregular hexagon is comprised of two parallelograms. To get the areas of the parallelograms, just multiply their bases times their heights, just as you would do to find the area of a rectangle, and then add up their areas.

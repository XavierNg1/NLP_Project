 Although most child care providers do not work nonstandard hours, you may be able to find one that does. Your local government will likely have a website that will help you find child care in your area. Call around and ask if any of them will watch your child during nonstandard hours. Unfortunately, child care offered during nonstandard hours tends to me more expensive than that offered during regular hours.When you talk to a child care provider, ask things like “Do you watch children at night?” and “What are your rates for evening childcare?”
If you are receiving any government assistance, make sure that your child care provider accepts it.
 If your job allows you some flexibility, consider rearranging your schedule to better align with that of the child care provider. For example, if you work a night shift, ask a coworker who works the day shift if they would be willing to switch with you. You might also talk to your boss about working while your children are at school.With your boss, you might ask things like “Can I work more day shifts so that I can be home with my kids at night?” and “Would it be possible for me to work on weekdays instead of weekends?”

, Many people who are unable to get full-time child care use a combination of family, friend, and group care. For example, you might be able to use a child care provider during regular hours and then leave your kids with a family member when you work at night. Unfortunately, because there are few options available for people that work nonstandard hours, you may have to try multiple options.

 Create a 'New Document' with a size of 800 pixels wide by 600 pixels tall.;
, Start by creating one of the butterfly's wings with the pen tool. Set the stroke to "3 pixels," and don't worry about a fill at this point.
 An easy way to create symmetry in an artwork is to copy and paste like shapes. First, select the original butterfly wing, select 'Copy' (generally located in the 'Edit' menu of a program's toolbar), select 'Paste', and then drag my duplicated wing into place. Now you have a set of wings!

, After selecting the tool, simply click anywhere on the artboard, click and drag to your desired size. Copy and pasting can also come in handy here.
, With 2 clicks of the Pen Tool, you can create one antennae connection. After that, copy and paste to apply the same line to the opposing antennae.
 The graphic looks a but basic and cluttered with all of the overlapping lines, don't you think? That can be fixed by adding 'Fill' colors to the shapes and removing/recoloring the outlines or 'Stroke'.
 You might use brown with a slight red tint, as pictured here (RGB value: #6B4411). You can also change the outline (stroke) color from black to the new brown. In the case of the antennae connections, only the stroke needs to be modified.
 After applying the same treatment to the wings (this time using a dark red color: #B54B1D), you have a fully colorized digital butterfly!

, This more advanced technique can be applied to fills to create a more natural or interesting colorization. For each wing, you can apply a 'Radial Gradient' combining two colors (a yellow: #D3D400 with a red: #B54B1D) to produce a more naturally colored pair of wings. Check out the final product!

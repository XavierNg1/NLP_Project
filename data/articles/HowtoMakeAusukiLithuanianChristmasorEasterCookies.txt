 Add extract. Sift the flour with a pinch of salt. Whisk the flour, butter, and the sour cream into the egg mixture. Make the dough into a ball and cover with a little flour and place in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for an hour to chill or until the next day.;
, Roll out 1/4 of the dough on a floured surface until it's very thin. You may need to add flour to keep the dough from sticking as it gets thinner and thinner. Roll out the dough until it is so thin you can see the design of the cutting board or kitchen counter, through it.
 Cut the dough into small diamond strips, about 4" x 2". Cut a lengthwise slit in the middle of each strip. Pull the other end through the slit. It's not an Ausuki unless you tie this knot!

, It is best to use an electric frying pan so the temperature stays around 380 degrees. Brush off any extra flour from the ausuki before it goes in the oil. Test the oil by dropping a scrap of dough, it should sink to the bottom and immediately float to the top. When this happens the oil is ready. Fry for about 1-2 minutes, only a maximum of six at a time, so that the oil stays hot. When the ausuki appear light, light golden on the edges, flip them, fry for about 20 seconds more. They should puff up. Do not brown! Use a metal prongs to remove them and hold them over the oil to drain before placing on a paper towel to drain more.

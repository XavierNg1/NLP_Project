 Bohemian buns are usually created with a side part. Part your hair where you normally part it, or consider creating a deeper part for an elegant look fit for an evening event. Use a comb to make sure your part is completely straight.;
, A bohemian bun is quite pretty positioned at the nape of the neck, but you can also position it higher up if you'd like. If you want a wedding-friendly look, consider doing a side bun, with the bun resting just under your ear.
 Choose a very tight hairband, since this style tends to fall out more easily than some. Take the hairband and wrap it over your gathered hair.
 Twist it and pull it over your ponytail, but don't pull the hair all the way through. Stop pulling when about half of your ponytail is still hanging down. You now have a looped bun held in place with the hairband.









Check to make sure the hairband is holding the bun securely. If it seems loose, take a second hairband and wrap it tightly around the looped bun to hold it in place.
 Take the ends that are still sticking out and wrap them around the hairband up against your head. You want to completely cover the hairband so it's no longer visible. Secure the hair in place with bobby pins.
 Pull out a few strands of hair on either side of your face to soften the look. Consider pinning a flower or another decorative hair piece just above the bun. Keep everything in place with a spritz of medium-hold hairspray.

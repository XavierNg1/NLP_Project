 Giving your baby a massage can be very soothing for them. This can be done by placing the baby on their tummy and gently rubbing their back.


The arms, legs and belly can be gently stroked as well. It can also be helpful to apply pressure to the baby’s tummy, as this can help to release any trapped wind.
To apply pressure on the tummy, the baby can be placed face-down on the lap or upright with the tummy against the shoulder of the guardian.
 You are encouraged to keep your baby active, as some colicky babies respond well to movement.


Walk the crying baby around in their carrier or take the baby outside while placed in their stroller.
You can also try holding the baby in your arms and rocking them gently from side to side, or even dancing with them.
 Try swaddling your baby in a warm blanket that you've just taken out of the dryer. The combination of feeling secure and warm helps to increase comfort and reduce the crying.
 Some babies can be soothed by a warm bath in a warm room. This helps to relieve any tension in the baby's body and make them more comfortable.
 Although colic is relatively normal and is not usually not a cause for concern, there are certain situations where it's advisable to seek medical help:


If the baby cries constantly for more than 3 hours. This may indicate the baby is in distress or intense pain.
If the baby’s belly is hard and she cannot be comforted (provided you have tried all means of comforting her).
If the baby has a fever over 100.5º F (38ºC). This indicates that the baby may have an infection and needs to be treated right away.
If you are unsure of how to care for the baby and you are afraid you might cause additional pain seek help right away.

 There will be a short tutorial that will give you easy step-by-step instructions on the basics the game. Unless you have played the game before, it is recommended to not skip this important part of the game.
 Customers will line up on the left side of the game screen, waiting for you to seat them. Drag them to a seat with your mouse. Wait for them to read the menu until they raise their hands. Pick up their orders by clicking on their table, and then to the rack on the left side of the counter. The cook will automatically prepare the food. When the food is ready, you will hear a ding!, and will be on the counter with the table number. Click on it, then to the table with the highlighted table number to serve them. Wait for them to finish eating. Once they raise their hands, click on the table to give them a check. Click again to pick up the dishes, and then to the dish bin on the top right side.
 Your customers will have 5 hearts displayed. When the hearts are gone, the customers will leave angrily. Avoid this by serving them quickly, and offer drinks to refill the hearts. Some customers are more patient than others.
 There is a goal that you must reach in order to pass the level and go on. If you have reached it, there is also an "Expert Goal" that is more difficult to reach. Instead of serving one customer at a time, serve many at once for the most points as it would be multiplied.

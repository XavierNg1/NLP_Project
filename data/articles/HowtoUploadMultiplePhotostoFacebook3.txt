 On almost all pages on Facebook, you can make a new post. There’s a post box located at the top of the News Feed, on your Timeline, and on your friends’ pages. Locate this post box to start making a post.
 Inside the post box are some options for posting. You can post photos and videos, along with your status. Click the Photo/Video link in the post box, and a small window will open with your local computer directory.


Select the photos to be uploaded from your local computer. You can select multiple photos to be uploaded at the same time.
Click on the “Open” button on the lower right corner of the small window, and the selected photos will start uploading to the post box. You can see them being uploaded right on the post box.
 Once the photos have uploaded to the post box, they will be displayed in thumbnails. You can add an accompanying status or message to your post, and tag your friends too. Click the “Post” button on the post box to post your new post with the photos.

 This is reverse polarity.
 As you are welding, keep your electrode extended between ¼” and 3/8” from the contact tube. This will help make for a clean, regular weld.
 Use carbon dioxide as an economical choice to provide deeper penetration on steel. This will be too hot for thin metals though. Use argon for aluminum welding, and a mix of argon (75%) and carbon dioxide (25%) for thinner steel.
 The angle should not exceed 10 degrees in either technique. Keep the wire at the front edge of your weld pool. This will give you greater control over your weld.


Drag welding pulls the bead along with the tip. This will give you a deeper penetration and a narrower bead.
Push welding pushes the bead with the tip. This will give you a wider bead.
 Use the welder to place material directly into the joint. You can use a back and forth method to fill large gaps. For flat joints, hold the gun at a 90° angle.
 You must lower the gun angle slightly to keep the filler from sagging. Keep the same push or pull angle as normal. Use a back-and-forth weave motion to fill large gaps.


Keep the amperage the same as a flat weld. You may need to use a slightly smaller diameter wire to keep the weld pool from getting too big.
 For thin materials, start at the top and move the pool down with gravity. This keeps the arc from penetrating the material. For thicker metals, start at the base and work up. This will help increase penetration.


You may want to lower the amperage by around 10-15% to help fight gravity.
 Use standard welding techniques, but increase your travel speed. This will help prevent filler from falling out of the joint. You may need to increase your gas flow rate.


Keep your nozzle clean, as spatter will build up faster when welding overhead.
 Once you are done with the weld process, grind off any excess filler. If the weld is defective, grind it down and re-weld the joint.

 If you are trying to mate your dog and you are having difficulty doing that then you should first think about what the potential problems might be. If you can identify what the problem might stem from, then it may be easier to address. For a male dog, some potential risk factors for infertility include:Age, too old or too young
Injury to reproductive organs
Physical injury or physical inability that restricts ability to mount female dog
Medications that decrease fertility or sex drive

, Lack of interest in mating can signal that your dog has a hormonal problem.Take your dog to its veterinarian if you are trying to get it to mate and it does not want to.


When you are trying to get a male dog to mate you need to get it near a female dog that is in the right stage of its reproductive cycle. The female dog will give off pheromones that lure the male dog towards it and initiate the breeding process., If you are convinced that the issue with infertility is with the dog's semen, and not its ability to consummate sexual intercourse, then you can have the semen tested. Semen testing will tell you about the quality of the dog's sperm, if they are formed correctly, and if they have the ability to move towards a female dog's egg.Semen testing is done at many veterinary clinics, as well as clinics specializing in breeding and fertility.
Conditions that semen testing could identify include Teratozoospermia. This is a condition in which the dog's sperm do not form correctly and some of them are abnormally shaped.

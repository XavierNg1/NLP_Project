 Don't force them to go outside if they're not ready. Slowly ease into it. Once you see that your kitten is ready for the outdoors keep the back door open a smidge and let him wander over to it. Once he gets outside he'll probably already be sniffing and adjusting to the new location and smells.;
, Keep the sections from 5-10 minutes. Make it part of his routine so he becomes more eager to go outside by himself.
 Sill be aware that he is outside but don't keep a close eye on him. Eventually after he has had several sessions with being outside by himself. Let him freely go in and outside whenever he wants.
 The hardest part of letting your kitten go outside is letting them be exposed to the road. Some will only let their kittens out the back. But if you want your kitten to also freely go out the front. Here is what to do. If you live on a very busy road first put him on a leash. He will be able to become familiar with the new smells but not vulnerable enough to get hit by a car. Still keep a close eye on him but let him explore without the leash. Slowly become less aware of him going out the front and start to pay little to no attention. Then let him explore by himself. It will take a while to get used to. But eventually your kitten will be able to go outside, freely whenever he wants.
 Still keep a very close eye on him especially when cars go past, but let him explore by himself. When he gets tired or bored he will come inside because he doesn't know where else to go. Eventually let him go outside whenever he wishes (out and front.) Soon you will realise that letting him explore on his own was the best decision you ever made.

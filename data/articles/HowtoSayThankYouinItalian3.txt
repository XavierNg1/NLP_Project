 This is the simplest way of saying "many thanks" in Italian.



Molte is Italian for the English word "many."
Pronounce molte grazie as MOLE-teh GRAHT-see+eh.
 Loosely translated, these sayings mean "thank you very much." Translated more literally, they mean "thanks a thousand times" or "a thousand thanks."



Mille is Italian for "thousand."
Either word order can be used to express the same sentiment.
Pronounce grazie mille as GRAHT-see+eh MEE-leh.
 Most often, the phrase is used seriously to mean "thank you so much."


The phrase can also be used sarcastically to mean "thanks a lot" in response to a slight or offense.
On its own, tante means "many" or "much."
Pronounce grazie tante as GRAHT-see+eh TAHN-teh.



The words ti and la are both used to mean "you," but la is more formal.

Tanto means "much" or "a lot."

Ringrazio means "thank you."
Pronounce ti ringrazio tanto as tea reen-GRAHT-see-oh TAHN-toe.

Pronounce la ringrazio tanto as la reen-GRAHT-see-oh TAHN-toe.
 The phrase roughly means "thank you very much" or "thank you so much," but more literally, it translates to "infinite thanks."



Infinite means the same thing in Italian as it does in English.
Pronounce grazie infinite as GRAHT-see+eh een-feen-eet-ay.
 The phrase is used to say "thanks for everything."



Di means "of" or "for."

Tutto means "all" or "everything."
Pronounce grazie di tutto as GRAHT-see+eh dee too-toh.
 The phrase roughly means "sincerest thanks" or "thank you very much."



Cuore means "heart" or "core." When used with di, it means "of the heart," "heartily," or "sincerely."
Pronounce grazie di cuore as GRAHT-see+eh dee quoar-ay.

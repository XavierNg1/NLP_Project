 Try calming techniques when you feel suspicions and racing thoughts coming on. These involve yoga, meditation, deep breathing, counting with eyes closed, and focusing on your center.;
, These can range anywhere from, "It's going to be OK," to, "I am worth this."

, Identify the root cause that is making you anxious or arousing your suspicions. If it is a TV show or reading material, stop watching and/or reading it. If it is more along the lines of generalized social anxiety, focus on just one person at a time and remind yourself that everything will be OK.
 Knowing that you took action and are prepared helps ease anxiety. Arm yourself with plans, sentences, and self-defense techniques just in case you should need these. Just knowing that you are powerful, in control, and can defend yourself can ease paranoia.
 Find things to laugh about around you, in life, in people. Watch comedy shows. Hang out with funny friends. It is more than OK to laugh and smile once in a while. You won't lose control. Instead, you will gain more of it by becoming less fearful and more attune with life, yourself, and what you want.
 If all of the above techniques just are not helping, you could always try medication, herbal supplements, and certain vitamins to help. Talk to your doctor about what might be the right course of action for you.
 Now-a-days, counseling is somewhat systematized, but it shouldn't be. Counseling is necessary and healthy for any and everyone, and it does a world of good just knowing that another human being has heard what you said and doesn't judge it at all. It is very healing to get to speak deep, true concerns, thoughts, worries, fears, and pondering each session.

 With good ball control and team coordination, you can keep control of the ball in the midfield and set up a gap in the opposing defense. Divide your team into two groups and practice passing back and forth as you look for gaps in the defense. If you can get an opposing player to run towards you, pass to a teammate as he moves to take advantage of the new opening. Try to "spread the field" with long passes, forcing the opposing team to defend across a long line.


You can also draw defenders by running forward without the ball, pretending you are about to make a run on goal.
Don't be a ball hog. The key to drawing out defenders — and providing an assist — is to constantly pass the ball.
 Crossing from the wing is an excellent way to get an assist. Ideally, the goalkeeper is facing you, and you pass to a striker behind him, running into the 18 yard box. This is an excellent skill to practice, especially if you are a winger or you take a lot of corner kicks.

At an amateur level, ground passes are usually best when passing in front of the goal. This will make it much easier for the forward to score. High balls are more effective only when the receiver is skilled enough to turn it into a goal.
Sometimes, a series of short and medium passes will accomplish the same thing. You may not get the assist, but you'll be a key part of the goal.
 This technique is a bit more technical, so you and the scorer will need a good deal of coordination. In this scenario, the scorer runs to stay on the same line as the defenders closest to the goal, making sure to stay on side. At the exact same moment, you kick the ball through the line of defenders as the scorer runs forward, receives the pass, and makes a run toward the goal., Attacking through the middle is the most difficult method, so you'll need excellent coordination with the striker. It will likely take several 1-2s and a great deal of skill to outplay the defenders and push through to the goal.

 It is the very first and very crucial part of learning how to fly. As it is a flying machine, so you have to make sure that you are safe in every aspect of the process. Also, as the Quadcopter is expensive, thus you should also consider its safety.
 Get a feel for the transmitter and make sure you understand how everything works.
 If you are learning to fly a Quadcopter, then you must do this in an open field which should be distant from any power lines or buildings. Try flying away from vehicles, windows and other distractions. Some people prefer to fly their drones by tying them to a 4-5 feet string so that it will not fly away in any case.


If your quadcopter is small, a space such as an indoor basketball court will be just as good.
 Then try rotating the other way.
 You should now be able to turn the quadcopter while flying forward by giving forward inputs and rotating the quadcopter simultaneously. You will eventually be able to try banked turns (flying sideways, forward and rotating all at the same time.) Don't obsess over it if you crash, as it happens to even experienced flyers. The quadcopter shouldn't be too damaged if the crash was light, and parts are almost always readily available online or at your local hobby store.
 You have to maintain a lower altitude of your drone i.e. 1-2 feet above the ground. After that, you can slowly lift it up in the air to see its speed of reaching the height. Do it slowly so that you can have full control over it., Don't try these too soon, however, and make sure that you have a great feel for the machine and can fly it through basic maneuvers very well. Be patient with yourself and have fun!

, This is the obviously the last part of flying a drone. After the flight, use your controls according to the user manual given and land your drone safely without breaking anything. Nowadays, there are a few drones like Parrot Bebop in the market which comes back to their take off place automatically and land.

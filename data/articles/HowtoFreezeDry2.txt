 Spread it out so that the pieces of food are not clumped together., If possible, make sure the freezer is empty of other items.

Don't open the freezer much while the food is freezing. This will slow the freezing process, and cause ice crystals to develop on the food.
If you have a deep freezer, use it. The food should be frozen at the lowest temperature possible.
 Over the course of about a week, the process of sublimation will take place, and all of the moisture will be removed from the food.

Test to make sure the food is completely freeze dried by removing a piece and allowing it to thaw. If it turns black, the food is not freeze dried yet.
 Once the food has completely freeze dried, place it in freezer storage bags. Push out the air, seal the bags, and store them either in the freezer, in your pantry, or in your emergency preparedness kit.

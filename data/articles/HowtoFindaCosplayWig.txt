 There are two important things that affect the price of a wig. They are:

Wig length: The rule is: The longer the wig, the more expensive it is.
Wig specifics: If the wig is designed for one specific character, it will probably be more expensive. One way to find a cheap wig is to be general. For example, if you're cosplaying as Grell Sutcliff from Black Butler/ Kuroshitsuji, don't search "Grell Sutcliff Wig." Instead, search "Long Red Wig.";
, Buy a wig with straps and hooks that can adjust to the circumference of your head. Failing to do this can run the risk of a wig being the wrong size and you having to send it back., "Cheap" shouldn't mean "bad-quality". Sure, you're searching for a cheap wig so that you can save money, but don't buy one that is so cheap that it turns out to be a horrible wig. Most cosplay wigs are made out of synthetic hair, which, if bad in quality, can shed, tangle, and tear., A lot of characters have crazy, unrealistic hair. The wigs for these characters can also be crazy and unrealistic. Buying a wig like this just for the sake of accuracy can be a hassle to maintain. For example, Miku Hatsune has thick, blue, floor-length hair. Buying the same wig will be hard to take care of. A similar wig that gives the impression of such hair will work fine., If you're lucky enough to live near a store that sells wigs that are suitable for cosplaying, then take advantage of the convenience and buy your wig there. However, if you don't have this luxury, your next best option is to order the wig online. Some suitable websites include: eBay, Amazon, AliExpress and Happy Cosplay.

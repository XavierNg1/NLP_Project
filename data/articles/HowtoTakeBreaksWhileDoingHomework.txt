 Whenever you start to fall asleep or get bored do jumping jacks for 2 minutes or stretch. This gets the blood pumping to your brain and help you focus.;
, If you start to get a headache get up and have a little snack and some water. Don't get something sugary because you will get jittery in your seat.
 You can use your break as a reward and tell yourself a goal. If you reach that goal you can take a break for a few minutes.
 When taking your reward break be sure not to play games or go on YouTube. These get very distracting and waste a lot of much needed time.
 Things look a lot more overwhelming if everything is in a big clutter around you.

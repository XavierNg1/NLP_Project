, The two main gripping styles are the pen hold grip (holding like a pen) and the shake hand grip (holding like a gun without your finger on the trigger). The second style is more common and makes backhand skills easier to develop. When using the shake hand grip, press the index finger against the racket back and the thumb against the racket front. Lower your wrist so that the racket points in the same direction as your forearm. This helps produce better ball topspin. Hold your index finger and thumb nearer to the tip of the racket during forehand strokes for a more comfortable holding position. Lower your index finger during backhand strokes so that the ball doesnâ€™t hit it, and put your thumb down for more comfortable holding. Keep your eye on the ball and use peripherals for gauging what kind of spin is put on it by your opponent.

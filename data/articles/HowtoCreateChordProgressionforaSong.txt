 The C-Major scale, for example, contains the following notes in the following order: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. This means that the following chords can all be a part of a song in C-major, so you can (and should) use them to create a chord progression in the key of C.






;
, In this fashion, a pattern in any key can be represented “generically.” For example -- a common chord progression is I-IV-V. This just means that, no matter your key, you hit the 1st note/chord in the major scale, then the 4th, then the 5th.



For example: In C-major, the I is a C, the IV is an F, and the V is a G.
 The I chord is called the root or tonic chord. It forms the base to which the other chords in a progression relate. Many books and other websites go into great detail about music theory, and there are many terms that you should ultimately learn and understand, but basic chord progressions always start with this "tonic."

, The first, the fourth, and the fifth (I – IV – V) are chords that sound good together in a progression for most genres of music. So, for the example in the Key of E-major, your thumb (I) would be E, your ring finger (IV) would be A, and your pinky (V) would be B. In time, you will learn these “chord sets”, but for now you should feel free to experiment. Other common progressions include:









I-V-vi-IV -- here, the sixth chord (vi) is played as a minor chord. This is why it is lowercase. It is sometimes switched up (in the chorus, or bridge) to vi–IV–I–V.
vi-V-IV-V -- Great over many genres.
The 12-bar blues.
ii-V-I -- here, the IV chord is replaced by its submediant, ii. The ii chord is a very commonly used replacement for IV. ii-V-I also makes the foundation for descending fifths.(iii-vi-ii-V-I)

, to change the feel of the song without changing chord progression. When playing the blues, the V chord is often played as a 7th. Sadder songs often use minor chords. You can adjust the type of chord while still following the root notes in your chord changes to make a great song in any genre, while still keeping the progression simple.











So, to play the blues in C using the 3-chord theory, strum C for four bars, F for two bars, a couple more C, then a bar of G7th, a bar of F, and back to C again…
C///, C///, C///, C///, F///, F///, C///, C///, G7th///, F///, C///…














, Once you have chord progressions down with the major scale, how do they sound with a different one? Note, however, that the classic I-IV-V chord progression is the exact same in major and minor keys..









The C-minor scale is: C-D-E♭-F-G-A♭-B♭-C. The I-IV-V chord progression is then C-F-G, just like before. But what happens with an I-V-vi-V progression? How do the progressions sound different with just one changed chord?

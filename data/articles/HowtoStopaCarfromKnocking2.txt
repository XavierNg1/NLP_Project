 Again, using the wrong fuel can be an issue. Not only can it cause knocking by igniting at the wrong time, it can also leave excess contaminants in your cylinders as a result of poor combustion.If you are now using the proper fuel, you may need to clean out the contaminants left by past fuels.
 While most fuels have a specified amount of detergent in them (at least in the US), this may not always be enough to keep your combustion chamber clean. Using top tier gasoline brands will provide more detergents that help keep your engine clean.Another way to clean your cylinders is to add a detergent to your fuel. This is as easy as buying a fuel additive at your local parts store and pouring it into your gas tank at your next fill up.This step is very simple. Just choose an additive and follow the directions on the bottle for putting it in your gas tank.
 If detergent hasn't gotten your engine running right, you can try an engine flush such as Seafoam. The flush reacts with the carbon deposits to remove them from your intake system, including the combustion chamber.Be aware that, when starting your engine for the first time after the flush, there will be a lot of smoke.
 Start the engine and listen closely. Your knocking engine should be running smoothly now.

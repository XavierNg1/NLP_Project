 Be specific and don't exaggerate. Try to provide as much detail as possible, including the timeline of events, damage on your vehicle, and the health of all involved.


Ask the officer where you can obtain a copy of the police report.
If the officer provides a reference number for the police report, make sure you jot it down.
 Even if you think you caused the accident, you should never admit to be at fault. Insurance companies hire a number of experts that will determine who is at fault. However, if you tell people you’re at fault, and it’s on record, you might be held responsible for damages.Be especially careful to not admit fault when talking to the other driver or the police. If you do so, it’ll be recorded in the police report.
 Some insurance companies require that you inform them of any incident, including minor accidents with not much damage.This will usually just involve answering questions about the incident.
 Making a claim means you’re actually seeking compensation from the insurance company. It starts with you contacting the insurance company; they will then obtain the police report and contact the other driver’s insurance company. They’ll likely ask you to visit a mechanic to have the damage to your car evaluated as well. Keep in mind, however, that there are certain circumstances when you might not want to file a claim:


A one car accident, where you’re only slightly injured if at all.
You can afford the damage to your vehicle, or the repairs are largely covered by the policy’s deductible.
Damage to either car is minor or nonexistent.

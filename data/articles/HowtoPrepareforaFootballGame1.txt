 When today’s game is over, start preparing mentally for next week’s match-up. Mental preparation for a football game includes skills such as visualizing success, eliminating distractions, improving your mental toughness, and staying positive.Focus your mind on one goal at a time.
Positive affirmations are not just for kids.Don’t be afraid to give yourself a pep talk now and then.
Even professional athletes feel pressure as stakes rise game by game.Whatever the stakes for next week’s game, stay cool and relax.;
, Each football game is a different battle. Your coaches will have specific goals and strategies lined up for the game ahead, and you and your teammates need to be proactive about getting on board.


The pros spend one or two days each week studying their next match-up and honing the right strategy.What works at one point in the season or against one team won’t always work at another time or against different opponents. Listen for changes to strategy.
 You can’t expect to play your best on game day if you haven’t given it your all during practice. Dig into drills without simply going through the motions, realizing that each aspect of practice is about preparing you for real in-game situations.Push yourself to improve not just stay in shape.
Build on-the-field relationships with teammates to improve how you work together when it counts.

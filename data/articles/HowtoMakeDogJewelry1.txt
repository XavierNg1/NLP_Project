 You just need something skinny, so you could also use a crochet hook or pencil. Orthodontic rubber bands are small bands usually used for braces, but you can find similarly small rubber bands online, at craft stores, or at office supply stores.;
, You need about 5 inches (12.7 cm) of 2-inch (5 cm) wide ribbon and 4 inches (10.16 cm) of 1-inch (2.5 cm) wide ribbon.
 Create a loop, where about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the ribbon overlaps. Put a small dot of glue in between the overlapping ends to help hold the loop in place.
 This ribbon should also be folded into a loop with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of overlap. Glue the overlap in place.
 Center the smaller folded ribbon in front of the larger folded ribbon, and keep the overlapping edges of both ribbons centered in the back. If desired, you can use a small dot of glue to help hold the ribbons together.
 Center the overlapping edges over the crochet hook. The rubber band should be visible and slightly below the ribbons.
 Stretch the top front of the rubber band out and up until it passes over the ribbon and reaches the end of the pen. Loop this end of the rubber band over the tip of the end so that the rubber band now loops around the pen in two places and holds the bow on the pen.
 Stretch the bottom back of the rubber band back and up, passing it behind the ribbon and over the top of the pen. The rubber band should be released from the pen at this point so that there is only one loop around the pen. This should also create a loop around the bow, holding it together.
 You may need to readjust the ribbon so that the rubber band is centered.
 The rubber band should still be attached to the bow.
 Hot glue may work best. The rhinestone adds a touch of bling to the bow, and it also helps hold the rubber band on.

 This method works best on thin leather shoes, since thick material will be difficult to sew. This method will make your shoe more narrow and harder to slip off, but if your shoe is much too long for you, use the water method.









If your shoes are much too large, try using both methods for more pronounced results. Try the water method first so you have a better idea of how tightly you should sew the band.
 These elastic bands may be found at craft and sewing shops or online. You only need a piece a couple inches (a few centimeters) long. If you prefer, cut off a larger piece for easier manipulation, then cut off the excess once the band is sewed on.
 Stretch the elastic band across the inside heel of the shoe. Stretch until it extends tightly across the back of the heel, then use safety pins or hairpins to fix it to each side. You may find it easier to pin the band to one side of the heel, then stretch the other side of the band across the heel and pin it again.









Make sure the band can be pushed back against the heel so you are able to sew it. If the band is stretched too tight and there is a gap between the heel and the band that cannot be pushed closed with a light touch, unpin it and fasten it slightly farther back to make it a little looser.
 Use a needle and thread to sew the band onto the shoe, then tie off the thread once you're done. If you would like more detailed sewing instructions, read the article How to Sew. Remove the pins once the band is fastened.









A curved needle may be easier to use., The band should pull the shoe to a narrower position around your heel, preventing the shoe from slipping off. If the shoe is still too long or extends too high above your foot, consider stuffing the toe with tissue paper or inserting a thicker insole.

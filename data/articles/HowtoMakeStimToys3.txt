 Plastic beads are cheap and simple, while glass beads look fancier and can be worn to work.


Ensure that the glue is clear and does not shatter easily. Two-part epoxy glue (which you mix by hand) or E-6000 work best for this., It helps to alternate between one large bead and one small bead. Try round beads to make them comfortable to spin in your hands.
 Then slip the bracelet on and off your wrist. Is it comfortable? Do you need to make it larger or smaller?


The knot may try to undo itself as you take the bracelet on or off. If this happens, ask a friend to pull the knot tight as you try it on.
 Place your bracelet on some cardboard, tagboard, or old newspaper. Pull the cord as tight as you can, then glue it. Apply plenty of glue to help it stay. Let it sit to dry as long as the instructions suggest.


Some glues, such as E-6000, involve fumes. Try gluing the bracelet outside. (When it is dry, the fumes will be gone and it will be safe.)
If your beads are translucent, try not to get glue inside the beads, as it may make them less shiny. A thicker glue will be easier to keep out of the center of the beads.
 If you applied lots of glue, you should be able to cut it very close and trim off any pointy bits so that it is smooth.
 With your other hand, pull the bracelet so it spins through your hand. You can also wave it around, run your fingers over it, or experiment with new ways to stim.

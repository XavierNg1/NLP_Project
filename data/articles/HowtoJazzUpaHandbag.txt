 If your leather bag has lost its shine, a coat or two of paint will revive it. Depending on the texture you want you can either use spray paint or acrylic paint. Use spray paint for a cleaner look. For more texture, apply the acrylic paint using a sponge. Paint your bag black or brown for a classy look. You can even paint it gold or silver. It will look like a brand new bag, and you'll keep up with the latest trends.
 That will add more flair to the handbag.

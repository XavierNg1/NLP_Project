 This method requires another person because two hands are needed to remove fake nails with dental floss.
 Place an orangewood stick at the bottom of the fake nail and slowly pry up the bottom edge of the nail.
 He or she should sit across from you and face you. Once he or she has slid the dental floss under the bottom part of the nail, he/she should hold each end of the floss in one hand.
 Use the floss to pull the nail up slowly and gently. Continue this sawing motion until the fake nail can be fully removed from the natural nail. Make sure your partner does not yank at the nail-if he/she were to yank too hard, your natural nail could come off with your fake one.









Repeat this process for all of your other nails.
 Peeling your fake nails off may have left your natural nails a little scratched up, so buffing them will smooth them back out.
 This will also smooth out any scratches on your nails.

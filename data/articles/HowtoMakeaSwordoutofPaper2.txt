 You can use any paper you like, but newspaper is extra big and lends to a much more intimidating sword.


If you're feeling rather crafty, spray paint the newspaper with silver spray paint -- or whatever color sword your ninja-self might carry!

, Start at the corner and roll the paper on a diagonal until you reach the other side. The tighter you make it, the sturdier it will be.


If you roll in a tight, circular fashion, the sword will be more like a tube or light saber. If you roll it in more of an ellipse shape, it'll be more sword-like.
 Sturdy, transparent packing tape works best, but any invisible tape should do the trick. If you do have packing tape, consider taping up the entire thing -- that sucker is never gonna come apart.


If the end of your sword isn't the right shape, grab your scissors and lob off a chunk on the end. Watch out for paper cuts!

, Only this time, don't tape it up. Bend it in half around the base of your sword. Tape the sword in between the halves. Then, tape the open ends of the handle together to form one continuous base.


The more tape you use, the longer it'll stick together and the more battles it'll endure. Be generous! Now, off to slay the Visigoths!

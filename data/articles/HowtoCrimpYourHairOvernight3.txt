 This style works best when your hair is damp but not wet. Take a shower and let your hair dry most of the way, or spritz it damp with a spray bottle of water.

Soak up any excess water from the shower or the spray bottle by using a clean, dry towel.
 Use a sports headband or any other fabric headband that wraps all the way around your head. Pull the headband up around your hairline.If the headband won’t stay in place, use a couple of bobby pins on either side of your head to secure it.
 Divide the hair behind the headband in two sections from your forehead to the back of your head. Try to keep the divide as close to the middle of your head as possible.Use a rattail comb to help you split your hair up evenly.
 Start the wrap near your ear, and work back toward the middle of the headband.

Wrap one side completely before moving onto the next.
Secure any loose parts with bobby pins.
 Allow your hair to dry completely while wrapped around the headband. Use a blow dryer on a cool, low setting to finish drying your hair if it isn’t complete by morning.

Use a heat protective spray if you decide to blow dry your hair.
 Unwind your hair from around the headband. Shake out your curls and style lightly with hairspray to hold the shape.

Use your fingers or a wide tooth comb to brush out your hair and loosen the curl.

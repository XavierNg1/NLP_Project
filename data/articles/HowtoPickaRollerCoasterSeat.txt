 If you aren't very, you should consider the middle as your best option. If you are very high, then you should consider the front or back.;
, If you are a smaller person, then you could use any of the seats you want. If you are larger, you should pick the biggest one, which is usually the last one.
 Most roller coasters have a limit of two so give each person a good amount of space so you don't bump into each other.
 Some roller coasters have lines in each seat. If you don't want to wait, choose the shortest. If you really want a car, choose that one.
 The back seat is rougher and jerkier, and you will feel the twists and turns more.

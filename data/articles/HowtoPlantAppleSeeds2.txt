 Locate an area of your yard or garden where you intend to plant the apple seeds. Prepare the ground by removing any weeds from the soil, pulling the weeds up by the roots. Also remove any large rocks or stones and break up any large clumps of soil.Pick an area of your yard that receives direct sunlight and that has rich, well-draining soil.
Well-draining soil means that water drains through the soil easily, rather than pooling on the surface of the ground. Well-draining soil is usually dark and fertile looking, as opposed to thick and clay-like.
Try to plant the seeds in early spring.
 Before you plant your sprouted apple seeds, you want to be sure that the soil is as hospitable and nutrient-rich as possible. After weeding, spread a one inch (2.54 cm) layer of compost over the soil. You can prepare garden compost or buy it at a gardening store.


Compost enriches soil with essential nutrients and also makes soil airier so that it can drain better.
 Use your hands or a garden spade to create an inch-deep (2.54 cm) furrow, or small trench, in the soil. If you are planting a number of seeds, create one long furrow. You need to extend the furrow 12 inches (30.4 cm) for every seed that will be planted., After you dig the furrows, plant the apple seeds in the ground, spacing each seed 12 inches (30.4 cm) apart from the next. Spacing the seeds gives them the space to grow and ensures that they wonâ€™t compete for soil nutrients., After planting the sprouted seeds, brush a thin layer of soil over the furrows to protect them. Then sprinkle on a one inch (2.54 cm) layer of sand on top of the soil you brushed over. Sand protects the ground from crusting in cold weather, which can impede the sprouting of the seedlings above the soil.

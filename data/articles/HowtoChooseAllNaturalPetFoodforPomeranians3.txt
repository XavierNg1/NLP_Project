 By-products, as well as meat and bone meal, come from the rendering process. They can contain animal remains, fats, grease, and other food waste from restaurants and stores.Dog food that contains by-products, i.e., feed-grade ingredients, can also contain toxins, such as mold-produced mycotoxins and pentobarbital, an anesthetic used to euthanize animals.
 Commercial dog food often contains harmful chemical and preservatives. Stay away from products that contain BHA, BHT, ethoxyquin, and propylene glycol (PG).Instead, opt for foods with natural preservatives, such as Vitamin C or E.
 Artificial colors, flavors, and sweeteners are ingredients that can cause diseases and illnesses in dogs. Food that contains artificial coloring, for example, Blue 2, Red 40, and Yellow 5 and 6, should be avoided. Additionally, all the flavoring in your dogâ€™s food should come from healthy meat and fats, and not artificial flavors.Avoid food with sweeteners, such as sucrose, Xylitol, ammoniated glycyrrhizin, and corn syrup, as well.
 Veterinarians are knowledgable about the brands that offer the best ingredients, and where to find these brands. They can also list specific brands to avoid. Therefore, your veterinarian will be able to recommend brands, as well as a diet regimen, that caters specifically to your Pomeranian's needs.

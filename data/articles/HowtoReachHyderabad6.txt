 Hyderabad is a blend of the new and old. There are high rise malls in good measure, catering to the general masses. There are also branded outlets, where you can find your favorite pair of jeans for under 15US$!!

, The shops surrounding Charminar are mind boggling. Every lane there is dedicated to one item. The Bangle lane, the lace lane, the saris lane, mehendi lane, so on and so forth. (Please bargain, and start from less than half the price. They will sell it to you at half the priceÂ ;))

, You cannot bargain much at most of these places.
 Things you might want to buy are bangles made of lac, bidri work items, sheeshas, saris, fabrics like silk and cotton, etc.

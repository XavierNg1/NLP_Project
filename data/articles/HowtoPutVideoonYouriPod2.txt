 Your iPod can only play .m4v, .mp4 or .mov files. Your video should be a .mov file. If it doesn't have this extension, you'll need to convert it. Otherwise, simply open it in iTunes and sync to your iPod.
 If you're using a Mac, you can use QuickTime Pro to convert your file into an iPod-friendly format.


Download and install QuickTime Player Pro 7.0.3
Select or import your video file.
Select File->Export

From the Export drop-down list choose Movie to iPod.
A new file will be created on your Desktop. Import this file into iTunes and sync your iPod.
 There are several third-party applications available for download online that will convert your video file to .mov.


For Windows, Videora, PQDVD, 3GP Convert, Leawo Free iPod Converter, Any Video Converter (that is the title), and Handbrake are popular choices.
For Macintosh, use Handbrake or VideoMonkey.
If you're having a hard time figuring out the process, type "help forum" into an online search, with filled in with the name of the application you downloaded.

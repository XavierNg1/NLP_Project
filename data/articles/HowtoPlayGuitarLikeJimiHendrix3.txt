 Yes, they learned a few things from other players, maybe took a few lessons, but the greats broke away from the herd and took music into their own hands. When you think about many artist using any media or art form in one way or another somehow got inspired by another artist who did the same thing. Read or watch biographies about artists that interest you. You don't have to just stick to Hendrix.
 Hendrix began playing guitar at 15, played music around Tennessee but found fame playing in England. He only played electric guitar and experimented with the sound. Before him, even though electric guitars had been around since 1931, they were played the same as an acoustic. Where most musicians simply amplified what they played, Hendrix used feedback, bending strings and percussion noises on the solid body guitar during his performances to distort and enhance the usual string sound. Every time he played live, the sound was different. His career spanned only four years, but he is still considered the most influential electric guitarist in the history of rock music.
 This guy is the legendary guitarist who people say sold his soul at the crossroads to the devil for the special guitar licks that no one can duplicate. The story goes that he learned a few things from other players, disappeared for a while, then suddenly reappeared playing a one of a kind style. He recorded 29 songs in a room at the Baker Hotel in Dallas, TX, in 1937, and every rock and roll (and blues) song is an extension of his work.
 He started off learning a few chords by a friend, got bored and taught himself to play by listening to records. He began live performances at 13, did studio session work for years, was a member of The Yardbirds, and by 26 had formed Led Zeppelin. Most of the recorded guitar solos from 1960 to 1968 in England were played by him, including work with The Who, The Kinks, Herman's Hermits and The Rolling Stones.

 You'll need:


Apples
Peanut butter
Jelly
Slivered almonds.
 Then quarter another quarter out of the middle of each quarter, exposing the apple flesh. This forms a "mouth" shape.


Sprinkle lemon juice on the exposed flesh to keep it from browning.
 Do a good mixture of both, for variety.
 These are the teeth of that give the apple mouth its "bite". This part is fiddly but the more you insert, the more skilled you'll get with it.
 A whole lot placed together looks festive on the Halloween table.

 What you put in your smoothie counts when it comes to health. Basically, your choice of main ingredients should ensure a very mineral-rich, alkaline smoothie. Veggies and herbs are packed with vitamins and minerals and provide delicious flavor for your smoothies. We recommend the use of celery, romaine lettuce, cilantro, basil, cucumbers, green beans, sprouts, yellow squash and zucchini. You can also use healthy, organic form of fat, like avocados, unrefined hempseed oil, flaxseed oil, cod liver oil, evening primrose or melted ghee or coconut oil. These add flavor and body and helps keeps your body feeling satisfied longer.We do not recommend the use of beets, carrots or other root vegetables because they become even sweeter when juiced or blended into smoothies.;
, Using a probiotic liquid like a few ounces of Energy-Biotic will add a balancing sour taste, much like lemon juice would. And the addition of beneficial microflora will help your inner ecosystem. Try a small amount of a soaked nuts or seeds or even a spoonful of any nut or seed butter that your body seems to like. These give a nice texture, consistency and flavour.
 Enjoy!

 Balloons are safe, don't hurt, and will help your child overcome any fears. Throw balloons at him and ask him to catch them. Once he masters that, start throwing the balloon at angles/ Then move on to a foam ball, and then to a tennis ball. Before you know it, you've got a "play catch" partner! If this takes time, don't worry! Be positive and practice a lot.;
, Use a soft ball so that nobody gets hurt. Tell him to:


Hold it in his better hand, and bring the opposite foot forward.
Bring the ball behind his ear, and bend his elbow pointing backwards.
Turn so that the side opposite to the throwing hand faces the target. This means that if he is throwing with his right hand, the target should be to his left. A common mistake is to stand with your chest facing the target. Avoid this.
Use the non-throwing hand to point at the target and throw. The ball may not go anywhere near the target, so be prepared to repeat and refine.
 Give him a plastic bat suitable for his size. Start with using a beach ball and move on to smaller balls. Once he is comfortable with a tennis ball, move on to a regular bat.

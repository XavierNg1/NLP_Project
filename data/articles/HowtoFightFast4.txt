 Like with punches, without the proper form you can’t throw a strong kick. Get in the stance for a Muay Thai kick by putting your left foot in front of the other, and your hands up close to your face similar to the jab stance.This will open your hip and allow you to have a powerful swing. When you’re ready to practice moving, you will lean on your toes of the forward foot and swing your back leg partially forward. Practicing the movement will help make you comfortable with it.


When you lean onto your toes, your lead hand will come up to protect your face. Meanwhile, your dominant hand will begin to swing backwards behind your body., When you move towards your toes and lift your leg towards your opponent, you need to point your dominant knee directly at the target.Think of it like lifting to give off the impression of a false kick.


The importance of putting your weight on your toes, not your heels, comes into effect here. By keeping your weight on your toes, you allow the rest of your body to follow through into full turn.
 After you’ve given the knee lift, come back down to the ground. Without losing your momentum, lean forward onto your toes, twist your body and kick your leg towards your opponent. Remember that you want your shin to have the contact, not your foot.You should apply enough force that your body does a complete 180 spin.


Be fast about your kick. A slow kick will leave you open and vulnerable to your enemy. Keep it quick to keep your muscles engaged, your kick powerful, and your opponent at bay.At the end of your 180 spin, lift your lead knee up against your side with your lead hand. This will protect your body from any jabs or returned kicks from your opponent.
When done correctly, the Muay Thai kick can be the most devastating fighting move. Keep practicing to develop a sure-way to end the fight.

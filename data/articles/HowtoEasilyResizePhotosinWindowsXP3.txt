 Click Start, and in the search field enter “Paint.” When the application appears, click on it to launch Paint.
 Click on the Paint menu button, click Open, select your image, and click Open again.


The current image size is shown in the status bar.
 On the Home tab, in the Image group, click Resize.
 The aspect ratio is the proportion between the height and width of the image. If you don’t check this, you’re picture may end up looking stretched or squished.
 You can choose to resize by percentage or by pixels.

Percentage will reduce the height and width by a set percentage. For example, if your picture is 800 x 600 px, and you want it to be 75% of the original size, enter “75” into either the Horizontal or Vertical fields, and your new image will be 600 x 450 px.






If you select Pixels rather than Percentage, you can enter the pixel dimensions of either the Horizontal or Vertical sides, and the other will be calculated automatically. For example, if you entered 450 as the Vertical dimension, the Horizontal dimension would automatically be 600.
 Click the Paint button, select Save as, and then click the picture file type for the resized image.

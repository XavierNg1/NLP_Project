 Do this when the soil is dry so it will be unlikely for the pool to float out of the ground. If the water contains chlorine or other harmful chemicals, make sure it's not going into storm drains or other places it could cause environmental damage.;
, This will allow water to drain out of it in the future.
 Toss it into the pool over the holes you have made.
 Then cover this with a layer of sand, or just fill it up the rest of the way with dirt. If possible, tamp it down as you go so you will have less settling over time. Be sure that the last foot of dirt is quality topsoil if you want to plant anything on top of it.

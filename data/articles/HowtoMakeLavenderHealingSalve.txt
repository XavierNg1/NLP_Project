Suitable containers range from well cleaned used makeup jars, spice jars, to any other small glass containers you have. Glass is the best material, but be sure the containers are able to handle heat up to up to 95 C (200Â°F). Plastics can leach chemicals into the salve as well as break down over time, so avoid using them.;

 Do this by keeping the water simmering and allowing the ingredients to gently come together.
 simmering Add the olive oil and lavender oil ingredients to the vessel. At this point, you'll notice that the mixture will solidify a little, which is fine.

 If you want to place it in the fridge, that's fine.
 Use on dried skin as required.


It's a good idea to label and date the salve so that you remember what it's for and when it was made.

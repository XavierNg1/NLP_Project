 You can probably find it through the school website, or just ask.;
,, Start off with something similar to this: "Dear Mrs/Miss/Mr._______"

,, Then, say why you won't be able to come eg. family emergency, sickness etc.
 End the email off with when you'll be coming back. If you're not coming back say you're not coming back due to this. You may feel you have the courtesy to say something like;" I'm sorry. I enjoyed your class and would like to seek this again in the future". This can be appropriate depending on what your attending, being taught and what type of schooling whether it be college or high school.
 At the end, put "Yours Sincerely,______."

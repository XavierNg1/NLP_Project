 Praise is a powerful motivator for good behavior. No matter what age your daughter is, she will appreciate it when you acknowledge her efforts. Offering more praise than criticism will keep your daughter feeling positive and encourage her to keep up the good work.


When your daughter completes a task, tell her thank you and praise her for a job well done.
Even if your daughter's behavior has room for improvement, look for reasons to praise her and focus on those.

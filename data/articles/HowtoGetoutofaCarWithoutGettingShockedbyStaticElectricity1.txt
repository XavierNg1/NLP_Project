 Most shocks happen because you and the car have picked up opposite charges. Leaving your seat separates these charges, creating the potential for a static shock. Touching the metal of the car as you get out lets the charge balance out by flowing harmlessly through your hand.If you still get shocked, the paint on the metal might not be conductive enough. Touch bare metal instead.;
, Another way to protect yourself is to touch the car with a coin or other metal object after you get out. You might see a spark travel between the car and the coin, but it won't hurt your hand.


Don't use a key that contains an electronic chip. The shock could destroy the chip and make your key unusable., If you've already left the car and don't have any coins on you, put your hand on the window. Glass is less conductive than metal, so the charge will run through you too gently to cause a shock.

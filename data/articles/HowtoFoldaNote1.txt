 Valley-fold the paper in half vertically. Make a second vertical valley fold so that the paper is now 1/4 its original width.


Note that the height or length of the paper should remain unchanged.;
, The upper left corner should be folded diagonally to the right and the upper right corner should be folded diagonally to the left.


Only fold enough of the end so that the edge of the folded corner remains perfectly aligned with the edge of the paper strip.
 The upper triangle should be folded down and to the right and the lower triangle should be folded up and to the left.


There should be a slanted parallelogram on each end, and the original triangles should be hanging off the main body of the paper.
 Turn the note over to the back. Fold the upper triangle to the right and the lower triangle to the left.


You should be left with two triangles that hang off the main body of the note but are aligned with the edges of the main body.
At this point, there will be two distinguishable triangles on the front and two on the back.
 Turn the note back over to the front side. Fold the bottom edge of the back lower triangle should up to meet the lower edge of the front upper triangle.
 The top edge of the back triangle should be folded over the front of the note so that it meets the bottom edge of the note.


Your note should already be confined to a square space at this point. The only thing remaining is a final maneuver that holds the note together.
 Move the tip of the triangle facing you into the pocket at the very bottom of the note.


You should be left with a square note divided into four separate triangular sections.
This completes the fold.

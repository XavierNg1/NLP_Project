 Using very basic soap, (one without moisturizers or oils), soap the wood of the sticky drawers on the sides, slides and bottom side rails. This solution works very well most of the time. In the kitchen and bathrooms, however, where moisture is more common, the soap solution will only help for a very short period of time. This method is best for the doors and windows all across the house.

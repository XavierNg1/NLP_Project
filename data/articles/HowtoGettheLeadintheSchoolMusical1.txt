 You can't suit your audition towards a certain role if you don't know what the characters are like!


For example, if the show is "Wicked," you'll want to research the show, the characters and their traits, and listen to the songs on loop constantly until your audition.
If your show is lesser known or written by teachers or students, ask the directors or playwrights in advance about the characters and the themes of the show. It will help you get a grasp on what you need to know.;
, Also known as a Show Stalk, this is an intense session where one looks up the show they're auditioning for on the Internet in whatever way they can (including all search engines and avenues for research), finding their desired characters and everything about them.
 If you're given audition scenes by the directors, print copies and rehearse them with as many people as will agree to help you. Practice any scenes that make you uncomfortable as much as possible, after all, you want to show your versatility.Â If required, look for a monologue that is not from the show itself but has the same "air" as the character you're auditioning for. For example, if you're auditioning for the role of a 1950s housewife, don't pick something from a modern production featuring a ten year old child.


Remember: In the actual audition, don't try to play down on the scenes you read for that aren't on the character you want. If you want to play a beautiful woman and are asked to read for a baseball player, act like a baseball player! This has proven particularly well for myself in particular- The directors will be looking for you to be versatile and ready for anything, and if that means reading for a baseball player, pretend to chew that Juicy Fruit and slouch. Convince them that every second you have on that stage will be used to the best of your abilities, instead of only craving your shining moment.

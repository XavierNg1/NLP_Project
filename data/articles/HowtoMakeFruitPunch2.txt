 Easy fruit punch is made by mixing juices and sodas with pre-mixed tropical punch. It's a step up from simply serving plain bottled tropical punch at a party. By adding fresh ingredients, you can transform bottled punch into something fit for any occasion.Be sure to mix the ingredients until the sugar is completely dissolved. You can skip the sugar if you don't want your punch to be too sweet.
Add 1/2 cup of lime or lemon juice to give your punch a fresh boost.
 Right before serving, pour in the ginger ale to add flavor and carbonation to your punch. Make sure you add it just before serving, or the punch might go flat before the party starts.


You can substitute the ginger ale for lemon-lime soda.
Or try adding plain club soda if you think your punch is already sweet enough.
 Pour it from the bowl into a glass serving bowl or tureen. Serve the punch in small cups with ice. Here are a few optional serving suggestions:


Make an extra batch of punch and freeze it using regular ice cube trays, then add the punch ice cubes to the punch when you're ready to serve it. If the punch is for a themed party, try making an ice ring (freeze punch or water in a bundt cake pan) or an ice hand for halloween (freeze punch or water in a latex glove tied at the end).
Add several scoops of lemon, orange, raspberry or strawberry sherbet directly to the punch bowl, or serve each cup of punch with a tiny scoop.
If the punch is being served at an adult party, add 2 cups of white rum or vodka to make it alcoholic.

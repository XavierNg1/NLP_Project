 You can easily open Google Chrome Settings by typing chrome://settings on your address bar.
 Then click the “Show Home Button”.
 Click on the "change" then a small overlay window will appear.
 Then type https://www.google.com/ncr

, Now you can access Google.com anytime.


The local domain setting has to represent the country you are in. The reason being is that when you are in local mode, NCR is disabled, so Google will redirect you to your own country specific domain.

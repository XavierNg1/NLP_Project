For girls, a good selection would be casual dresses, formal dresses, jackets, leggings, t-shirts, tights, jeans, flats, heels, boots and trainers.
For boys, Jeans, t-shirts, shirts, trousers, jackets and shoes.
 Girls may want to wear heels at this age, and that is fine as long as they are not worn daily and are not too high (2-3 inches is ideal). Smart shoes should be kept for school and special occasions, and for daily activities casual shoes should be worn.
 In winter you will need a coat, and in summer you will probably want to wear light, loose clothing.
 It's fine to shop in the adults department at this age, but choose modest clothes, as boys/men might take it the wrong way.

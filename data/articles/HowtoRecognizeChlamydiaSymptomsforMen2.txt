 These aches, also known as reactive arthritis, can indicate that a chlamydia infection.Approximately one percent of men with urethritis will develop reactive arthritis, and approximately one-third of these patients have the complete reactive arthritis triad (RAT) formerly referred to as Reiter syndrome (arthritis, uveitis, and urethritis).Scrotal pain and swelling is the most common. If left untreated, as the chlamydia progresses, you will have a feeling of fullness in your abdomen, caused by infection in the epididymus, that leads to these other lower body aches.
 If you recently engaged in oral sex and have a sore throat, you could have contracted chlamydia from your partner this way, even if he wasnâ€™t showing any symptoms.Transmission of chlamydia is possible from penis-to-mouth, as well as through vaginal and anal sex.
 Men with chlamydia may develop a fever and become nauseated, especially if the infection has spread to the ureters.A fever is generally anything higher than 37.3C or 99F.

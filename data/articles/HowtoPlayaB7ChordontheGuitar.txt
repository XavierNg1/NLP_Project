 Use your index finger to barre the second fret, ignoring the thick E string on top.









Don't forget that guitar strings count up from the bottom. The thing string is the 1st one, the thickest the 6th string.

Shortcut: If you know the B-major chord, you only have to remove one finger to get an B7. Remove your finger from the 3rd string and leave it open. You've now got a B7;
, If you remember how to form an open A7 chord, your fingers will be in the same shape. If not, simply use your ring finger to fret the 4th fret on the 3rd string.
 Just let the barred 2nd fret ring out instead of fretting it further down. Make sure you can here this barred string cleanly.
 This takes some beginners some practice, but is a great way to start training your fifth finger. This is the second thinnest string on the guitar. Leave the string below it, the high-e, open.









Make sure that your ring finger doesn't mute these string accidentally.
 Strum out every string by the top one to sound out your beautiful B7.

--X--, If you know an open E7, you can simply move this form down the neck to the B, barre it, and have your B7. This only works for chords starting on the sixth string, but this makes it easy to play a seventh chord anywhere. Imagine that the open strings were actually a barred fret -- they are all the same "fret" being sounded out in your chord. This means your other two fingers will make any chord "barred" a 7th. Since the B fall on the 7th fret, your B7 barre chord would look like:

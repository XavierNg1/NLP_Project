 The darker the wash of the jeans, the more flattering the jeans will look on your body.An added benefit to wearing a dark wash is that the jean will easily transition from day to night. Just add a nice shirt and a pair of heels.
 If you’re trying to make your thighs appear longer and leaner, the best thing you can do is pick a simple jean. Lots of jeans incorporate extra trends – distressing, bleaching, strategically placed rips, etc. These details will only draw more attention to your thighs and make them appear larger than they actually are.If you insist on getting jeans with detailing, look for detailing that falls on or below the knee.
To streamline your lower half even more, avoid rear pockets with buttons on them in favor of more streamlined pockets.
If you have a flat butt, buying jeans with detailing on the back pockets will make your butt look bigger and fuller.
 Most jean retailers offer a skinny jean option in a “stretch” fit. These jeans are made with Lycra and they have more give than normal skinny jeans.Stretch jeans are generally more forgiving than non-stretch jeans, which makes them a great choice for curvier body types.
Stretch jeans are also a great option if you’ve put on a couple pounds, are dealing with period bloat, or are preparing to eat a large meal.

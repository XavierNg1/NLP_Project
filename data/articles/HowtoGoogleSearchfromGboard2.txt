 Gboard is a custom keyboard that enables integrated Google Search and Android-style glide typing. Search for Gboard in the App Store and press “Get” to install. Upon launching, follow the explicit instructions displayed to get set up.
 Tap the text field in the app you are using to compose your message. Tap and hold the globe icon on the keyboard and select Gboard.


Alternately, tap the globe icon to cycle through your available keyboards in sequence.
 Tap the message body and enter some text.
 Tap the Google icon and a popup appears in the predictive search: "Did you mean to search for ".
 Tap the popup to search for the content you have already typed into the message or one of the other predictive search queries. Swipe to browse search results

, By default, Gboard will search the web and return results as Google normally would. However, after your search, if you tap the image icon or GIF button at the bottom of the search results, you can filter your results down to either images (click the mountain picture) or GIFs.
 Results can be shared with your message recipient or viewed in the web browser using the two buttons at the bottom of each search result.


The "Share" button will copy the search result to the clipboard to be pasted into the text body. Note that sharing the search will NOT remove the text already placed into the text body. This can help streamline writing a message combined with a search result.
The arrow button will open the link in a separate web browser window if you wish to view a search result in full.

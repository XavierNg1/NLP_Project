 Go into your room, put on your headphones and crank up the stereo if you must. The further away you are from the "line of fire" (verbally speaking) the less likely you'll be emotionally drained from the experience.
 This is true even if your name comes into the conversation. In this case it has more to do with a disagreement between parenting styles and little to do with any misbehavior on your part. Remember that it was never or now your fault.
 Don't let this issue get in the way of how you feel about yourself. Try to say a couple good things about yourself before you go to school or anywhere.
 It's difficult for a child to call emergency services but if violence erupts, it's the best option. The authorities can remove you and your siblings from the home until everyone has calmed down.
 Slowly but surely, it will end.

 You can drizzle zig zags straight onto desserts or plates, using melted chocolate or chocolate syrup. For more complicated designs, try piping melted chocolate onto a baking sheet lined with waxed paper. Transfer the sheet carefully to the refrigerator or freezer for about ten minutes, or until the chocolate is cold and solidified.Prop these designs vertically in ice cream or lay them flat onto any cold dessert, immediately before serving.


Use dark, white, and milk chocolate to create a varied appearance.
 Strawberries, grapes, or cubes of any fruit can be dipped in chocolate and chilled to harden into a delicious dessert in their own right. Stick them onto skewers and arrange them in a fan shape by sticking the other end of the skewer into a halved melon containing fruit salad or another dessert.
 Use an edible flower grown without pesticides, preferably one with a pleasant scent. Whip an egg white until it foams, then use a brush to coat the flower. Sprinkle white granulated sugar over the flower, and use sparingly as a topping for rice pudding or other desserts.
 Any flavored liquid can be mixed with gelatin powder, from herbal tea to fruit juice. Heat according to the instructions on the gelatin packaging, then pour into molds and chill until the gelatin sets. If you don't have any decorative molds, cut the gelatin manually into cubes, diamonds, or other shapes.


You can even use soup stock or savory herbs in water to create savory gelatin.

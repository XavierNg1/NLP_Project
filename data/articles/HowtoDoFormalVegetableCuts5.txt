 Prepare a stack of julienne cut vegetables. Brunoise is precisely the same method as Julienne, but with an extra final stage.
Group the julienne into a neat stack and cut the sticks into small cubes every 4mm / 1/8th of an inch to make small cubes. This is used for fine diced vegetables such as onion, mushrooms etc. The desired result is 4 x 4 x 4mm cubes

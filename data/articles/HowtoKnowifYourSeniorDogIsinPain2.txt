More dilated pupils, as well as smaller, or more constricted, pupils can be a sign of pain in the eye or elsewhere in the body. Also beware of squinting or bloodshot eyes, as both can indicate your senior dog is in pain., If your dog is limping or dragging one of their legs, they could be in pain. Similarly, tensing their abdominal and back muscles to create a tucked up or hunched appearance might indicate they are suffering from pain., If you notice changes in your dog’s mobility, such as having trouble going up and down stairs, or experiencing difficulty running and jumping, it could mean they are in pain. Underlying issues like arthritis could be causing these changes in your pet’s mobility and triggering pain.

 Turn your iDevice sideways and it will transition to landscape mode. This will extend the size of the keyboard and keys, giving you more room to maneuver. It will also allow for a more comfortable handhold. To type faster in this position, use both thumbs instead of your index fingers.
 Instead of watching the keyboard as you type, look at the text as it appears on the screen. You will gradually train your thumbs to move ahead on the keyboard, increasing the pace of your typing. This is similar to a training exercise used by typists on traditional keyboards.


You will make mistakes as you practice. If you touch the wrong key, hold your finger down and slide over to the correct key. The key will not be entered until you release the pressure. Other than that, don’t worry about fixing errors until you finishing typing or it will slow down your pace.
 You can purchase one of a variety of typing trainer apps via the App Store. Some are pretty basic and focus on retention of short-cuts while others are more elaborate and include practice tests. The expanded versions usually include a fee. This is a good option if you are going to be typing a great deal and need to increase your speed and accuracy as soon as possible.
 If you’ve tried third-party keyboards, but still yearn for a tangible typing device, you may want to look into purchasing and using a Bluetooth keyboard. These keyboards are very compact (some even roll up) and can be connected to any iDevice. This is a good option if you are going to be typing extensively and are worried about hand cramps or ease of editing.

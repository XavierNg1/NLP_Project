 Very small dogs, like Chihuahuas or Pomeranians, are less able to regulate their body temperatures. Consequently, it’s a good idea to dress them up in a sweater or jacket when they go outside in below-freezing temperatures., If your dog has a thin coat and/or low body fat, they have less natural protection from the cold. Short-haired breeds, like Boxers, Greyhounds, or Dobermans, should have extra protection, like sweaters or coats, when they’re facing below-freezing temperatures to help them retain their body heat.This also applies to dogs, such as Poodles, that are highly groomed in a manner that keeps their fur very short.
 If you have a senior dog with a compromised immune system, it’s a good idea to give them the extra protection of a sweater or jacket when facing cold weather., Some types of dogs are specifically bred to withstand winter conditions. These large, hearty breeds, like Newfoundlands, Saint Bernards, and Siberian Huskies, come with thick, double coats of fur. They typically don’t require additional gear to help them with cold weather.Dressing up dogs with dense fur in outerwear can even be detrimental, leading to overheating.
 Regardless of your dog’s size, fur, breed, or condition, be sure to take cues from their behavior to see if you should be dressing them for the cold. If they show signs of being chilled, it’s always a good idea to bundle them up before you take them any further.If you notice that they’re shivering for an extended period of time, getting sluggish, coming to a complete stop, and/or trying to keep one or more paws off the ground when they walk, it’s likely that your dog is being negatively affected by the cold.

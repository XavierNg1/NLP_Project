 At this stage, you want your betta to get used to the water and its temperature.A sudden exposure to the (probably colder) water of the fish tank would be harmful to your betta.


Let the cup float for about 15 minutes.
 Do this slowly, using a baster or a small cup. Do not pour the tank water directly onto the betta; pour the water off to the side of the fish. At this point, the cup should still be floating in the fish-tank water.The betta needs to get used to some of the tank water, as it will have a different mineral hardness and pH level, in addition to a different temperature.
Leave this to sit for 15 minutes.
 You want the tank water and water from the cup to be very well mixed—almost at a 1:1 ratio—before you place the betta fish in the tank. Again, wait for 15 more minutes.At this point, you can use your fingers to feel the temperature of the fish-tank water and the cup water. They should be roughly the same temperature.
 Using an aquarium net, gently take your betta out of its cup and move it into its new tank. Be gentle, as you do not want to poke or harm your new fish.


If the water in the betta’s cup is relatively clean of excrement and silt, you can pour the fish and its water directly into the tank.

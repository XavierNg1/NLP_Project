 Vitamin D is an important nutrient for the body. Vitamin D is involved in the proper functioning of the immune system, cell growth, and cell regulation. It also aids the body in numerous ways, such as encouraging calcium absorption, promoting bone growth, and aiding in bone remodeling. Vitamin D prevents rickets, osteomalacia (softening of the bone), and osteoporosis (brittle bones). It has also been associated with cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment in older people, asthma in children, and even cancer.Low levels of Vitamin D also contribute to the risk of colon and pancreatic cancer. Vitamin D deficiencies can increase the risk of high blood pressure, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune diseases, insulin resistance, and Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes., Some people are more at risk than others for vitamin D deficiency. If you are in one of the at risk categories, make sure to eat as much vitamin D as possible. However, even if you don't fall under the typical category of someone who might be deficient, you could still be at risk. Have your blood tested to find out whether or not you are deficient, especially if you fall into one of the following groups:Elderly adults
Infants who are breastfed
Those with darker skin
Individuals who do not get enough sun exposure
Individuals who are obese, overweight, and those who have had gastric bypass surgery
People with fat malabsorption conditions
Those allergic to milk
Anyone who eats a vegan diet

, For people ages one through 70, they need 600 IU (15 mcg) of vitamin D a day. Under one year only needs 400 IU (10 mcg), and over 70 needs 800 IU (20 mcg)., You can also get vitamin D from the sun. Spend 10 to 20 minutes in the afternoon sun two to three times a week without sunscreen. Make sure you expose you face, arms, and legs to the sun.


Using a tanning bed is not the same as spending time in the sun. Make sure to consult a physician before taking any supplements, especially if you are on other medications.

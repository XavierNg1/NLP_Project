 Don't be too obvious with the question - your parents might suspect something and drop in to check on you!;
, Unless you are sure of when your parents might return, it's worth calling them to find out before starting out on this adventure.


Ask general questions like "Will you be home for dinner?" or "What time should I have my chores done before you get back?", etc.
Try slipping the question into idle conversation. You could say something like, "Oh, we can go out for ice cream if you'll be back before the shop closes up!"
Or maybe tell them to call you when they start heading home.
,, You never know when an unexpected arrival could catch you off guard and create an... awkward situation.
 Even definite schedules change and in this case, it's better to be safe than sorry!

 Hamsters don’t have great eyesight, which means they will navigate by smell. If your hands smell like something, especially something tasty, your hamster may bite your hand thinking it is food. If you are going to reach into the cage for any reason, make sure your hands are clean so your hamster can recognize your scent and know you are safe and friendly., Hamster teeth will grow for their whole lives. To keep them from getting too long or too sharp, make sure you give your hamster something to gnaw on like wood or twigs. This is healthier for your hamster, and will make bites less painful., You don’t want your hamster running around while you are trying to clean the cage. It will probably get startled, and may bite as you move around the cage. Make sure you take it out and put somewhere that it can’t get loose. A small animal carrier is a good place for a temporary stay.A hamster ball is not a good idea. If you put your hamster in a ball, you need to keep an eye on it at all times to make sure it doesn’t get overheated, or roll the ball down the stairs or to another place it can get hurt. That’s pretty hard to do when your concentration is on cleaning the cage.
 Hamsters that are hurt may become more aggressive, and bite to show their discomfort from a serious injury. When you pick up your hamster to take it to the vet, make sure you wear gloves as a precaution.Some other signs that suggest your hamster is injured include refusing to eat, bleeding, swelling, limping, labored breathing, squeaks or cries of pain, or sleeping more than usual.
Keep an eye out for wet tail, a serious disease. If your hamster’s rear area gets wet and stays that way, you’ll need to take it to the vet. Wet tail comes from unclean cages, so make sure you clean out the cage regularly.

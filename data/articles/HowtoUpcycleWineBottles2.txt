 Wine bottles are perfectly designed to make sure your plants get enough water when you’re not around. All you’ll have to do is fill the bottle with water and stick it upside down into the soil in your planter or garden.


If your soil is compacted, you may need to dig out a little hole to stick the bottle’s neck into.
You can also attach a terra cotta spike to the top of the bottle, which will help it penetrate the soil and stay in place., With a little bit of work, you’ll be able to turn wine bottles into an herb garden to keep in your kitchen or sunroom. You’ll simply have to cut the bottle in half and sand its edges. From there:


Flip the top of the bottle upside down and rest it in the bottom of the bottle.
Fill the bottle up with water so about an inch or two of the bottle’s stem has water.
Fill the top half of the water with soil or peat moss and plant an herb of your choice., Wine bottles also make excellent and natural flower vases. You can store water in the bottom and stick flowers or other plants down through the neck.


Feel free to take off the label, if you want.
Make sure to properly clean and rinse the bottle before putting flowers into it. Use soap and hot water to remove wine residue. Then, rinse it several times to make sure any soap has been rinsed out.
If you want a wide-neck vase, feel free to cut the top off and then sand it down.

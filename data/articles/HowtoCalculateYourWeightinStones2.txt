 Kilograms are a standard metric unit for measuring mass. People around the world use kilograms to measure weight.

For example, you might weigh 70 kilograms.
 One stone’s weight is 15.747 percent of 1 kilogram. So multiplying the number of kilograms by .15747 will give you your weight in stones. For example, 70×.15747=11.0229{\displaystyle 70\times .15747=11.0229}. So, 70 kilograms is about 11 stone.
 To do this, you need to do the opposite of what you would do to convert kilograms to stones. So, you would divide the number of stones by .15747.

For example, to convert 9 stone to kilograms, you would calculate 9.15747=57.15{\displaystyle {\frac {9}{.15747}}=57.15}. So 9 stone is about 57 kilograms.

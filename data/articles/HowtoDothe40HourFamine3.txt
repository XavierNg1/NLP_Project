 Eat high-carbohydrate foods (like pasta, spaghetti or rice). Have some vegetables and fruit and take a multivitamin or two if you can. Try to avoid lollies (candy). Remember to drink water during the fast, as this will fill you up and keep you hydrated. Do not over-indulge before the fast, as you do NOT want to throw up. Hire (rent) some movies or borrow a few books, as they will help take your mind off your hunger.
 Go to a park, go shopping (no credit cards if you've given them up) or go to dinner (if you're not fasting). The best way to survive this challenge is to stay occupied.
 You will want to be rested before you begin, especially if you've given up furniture by sleeping on the floor.
 Spend part of the 40 hours with him or her so you can encourage each other. It's more fun this way.

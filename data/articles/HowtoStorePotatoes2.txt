 Though it may seem like "cleaning off" potatoes will make them less vulnerable to rot, the truth is actually the opposite. Exposing potatoes to moisture shortens their storage life and makes them much more likely to rot. Keep potatoes as dry as possible before and during the storage process.If your potatoes are covered with dirt, let them dry out, then use a dry brush to remove any noticeable clumps. You can (and should) wash them right before you start to cook them.
 As noted above, refrigerators are too cold to store potatoes well. The cold temperatures inside a fridge will cause the potato's starches to convert to sugar, giving it an unappealingly sweet taste. This can also affect their color.If you do put potatoes in the fridge, let them warm to room temperature gradually before cooking. This will reduce the discoloration (though it may not completely eliminate it).
 Once you cut potatoes,cook them as soon as possible. The exposed flesh of the potato doesn't keep well compared to the tougher skin. If you can't cook a bunch of cut potatoes right away, store them under an inch or two of cold water. They will keep for about a day this way without losing their texture or discoloring., Many fruits, like apples, pears, and bananas, excrete a chemical called ethylene. This gas encourages ripening â€” you may have noticed that your fruits tend to ripen faster when you keep them next to each other. Ethylene can cause your potatoes to sprout early, so store your fruit elsewhere.

 Facebook will try to attach your location to posts that you make. You'll need to remove this yourself, and it will stay removed until you log out on that computer. There is no setting to permanently disable this feature.
 Facebook will add this location automatically.
 This will remove the location and you will be asked to select another one.
 You don't need to select a new location after removing the old one.
 This feature will reset after logging out. You'll need to repeat the process the next time you log in and make a post. You cannot permanently disable this feature.

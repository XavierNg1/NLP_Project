 Outside of wrestling, Cena records and creates his own music and rap albums, for example, his current WWE theme song "The Time Is Now". Cena also created his own rap message during his entrance in the 2003's Royal Rumble about how he was going to beat everyone - he was eliminated by the Undertaker a few minutes later.;
, When he first started all he wore was some spandex shorts.
 When his movie, "The Marine", came out in theaters, Cena's attire and in-ring personality has revolved around military colors and attitude looks. If you want to wrestle like him, read the articles on how to do his entrance and his "You Can't See Me" taunt.
 Born and raised in West Newbury, Massachusetts, of course a New Englander would have a liking for the Sox or Patriots.
 Cena has done everything at will to retain the WWE title for the duration that he did. He never lets a goal down and puts his all on the line to achieve something. He really believes in the positive aspects of life, as his motto in the WWE is "Rise Above Hate".

 This style works particularly well with a square scarf. Lay your scarf out flat and drape it over your head with the tail ends falling down your back. Then tie the tail ends together (under or over your hair, as you like) in a tight knot. If the tails are very long, you could additionally wrap them around the base of a ponytail or braid them into your hair.
 Lay your scarf out flat and roll or fold it up into a long, narrow strip. Wrap it around your hair so that the tail ends are above your forehead. Then, tie the tails together in a tight double knot. Tuck or pin the tail ends underneath the rest of the head wrap. Square scarves work well for this style of headband.
 Put your hair in an updo or braid depending on your style preferences. Then, wrap a scarf made out of a thin material (the smaller the better) around the base of the ponytail in a regular knot. Tie the tail ends together in a loop, adjust the fabric, and your hair now has an added element of adorable.
 If you have a long scarf in a thin material, try this style of headband. Fold the scarf in half lengthwise to create a loop on one end with the two tails on the other. Wrap this around your head so that both the loop and the tail ends are just above your forehead. Then pull the tail ends through the loop, and fold them back on themselves. Tuck or pin the two tail ends underneath the rest of scarf to hide them and keep the headband from falling off.

 Power is the rate that the circuit consumes energy, and the rate it delivers energy to whatever the circuit is powering (such as a light bulb).The total power of a circuit is equal to the product of the total voltage and the total current. Or in equation form: P = VI.Remember, when solving for total resistance, you need to know the total power of the circuit. It's not enough to know the power flowing through one component.
 If you know these two values, you can combine two formulas to solve for resistance:

P = VI (power = voltage x current)

Ohm's Law tells us that V = IR.

Substitute IR for V in the first formula: P = (IR)I = I2R.

Rearrange to solve for resistance: R = P / I2.

In a series circuit, the current across one component is the same as the total current. This is not true for a parallel circuit.
 If you only know the power and voltage, you can use a similar approach to find resistance. Remember to use the total voltage across the circuit, or the voltage of the battery powering the circuit:

P = VI

Rearrange Ohm's Law in terms of I: I = V / R.

Substitute V / R for I in the power formula: P = V(V/R) = V2/R.

Rearrange to solve for resistance: R = V2/P.

In a parallel circuit, the voltage across one branch is the same as the total voltage. This is not true for a series circuit: the voltage across one component is not the same as the total voltage.

 You can use just about any type of bottle for this. A large jug without a handle will work just as well as a milk jug with a handle. You can even use a regular water bottle!, Fill the bottle with water, then close the cap tightly. Shake the bottle, then pour the water out. Do this a few times until the water comes out clean. If there is a label, peel it away, then remove any residue., The size of the hole does not really matter, but it needs to be big enough so that you can cover it completely with your thumb. Something around 3/16-inch (0.48-centimeter) wide would be ideal, however.If you make the hole too big, you won't get a tight enough seal., If the bottle is made from soft plastic, you can do this with a nail or thumbtack.If the bottle is made from thicker plastic, you will need to use a drill and 1/16 to 1/8 inch (cc to cc centimeters) drill bit., Fill a large bucket with water. Place the cap on your bottle, then dunk the bottle into the water. Cover the cap hole tightly with your thumb, then left the bottle out.If your bucket is deeper than your bottle, dip the bottle only Â¾ of the way.
The bottle will only fill to the same water-level that's already in the bucket.
 Carry the bottle to your plant, then lift your thumb away. This will release the pressure, and allow the water to flow out of the bottle. When you want to stop the water flow, simply cover the hole in the cap with your thumb.

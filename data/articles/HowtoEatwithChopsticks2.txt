 Often at Asian dining tables (whether at home or at a restaurant) means sharing large plates of food. It's not proper to dive in to the communal meal with chopsticks that have just been in your mouth! You have two options:

Use a public pair of serving chopsticks that never touch your own (or anybody else's) bowl of rice/food
Pick with the other (non-eating) end of your chopsticks. That's the broad end that hopefully you're not chewing on!

, The rules of chopsticking don't end once you have the food in your mouth, unfortunately. Each society has slightly different rules, but in general:

Don't stick your chopsticks upright in your food. It's looked at as a bad omen and is reminiscent of incense at funerals.
Don't spear your food with the ends of your chopsticks. If all else fails, it may seem like a good alternative, but it's viewed as impolite.
Don't pass food from chopstick to chopstick. Also funeral protocol and viewed as bad (or even ominous) table behavior.
Don't cross your chopsticks. If you're done eating, lay them to the side of your dish on the left.
Don't point at people with your chopsticks. Pointing in general is a no-no in Asian cultures and same goes with chopsticks.

This page would be far too long if all the rules were listed. These are the basics.
 If a bowl of rice is placed in front of you and all you have are two small bamboo rods, you may feel like you're up a creek without a paddle. But it's perfectly acceptable (normal, rather) to lift the bowl of rice close to your mouth and work from there. You won't look foolish, you'll look seasoned!

You may feel a little like the Beast during his dinner with Belle, but rest assured, this is how it's done. Don't shovel the rice into your mouth like a caveman, but do lift up the bowl near to you to prevent rice drippings from accumulating around your eating area.

Japan has slightly stricter rules regarding this. If you're in China or Vietnam, for example, you may be able to shovel away.

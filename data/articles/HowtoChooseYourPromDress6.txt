 You might not like this idea of waiting around and you also might have a creative flair. If so, you could also design your own dress. You are probably thinking 'what?' but you could just sketch what you want on a piece of paper and take it to tailors to be made for you. Or, you can take in a picture of a dress and they can make a copy.


Do this at least four weeks in advance so that you have time to have it altered if needed.

 Before you enroll your child in a program, investigate how their learning will be scheduled and organized. Some programs split classroom time evenly between the two languages. Others follow a full immersion model and almost completely eliminate the use of the native language. Think about what model best suits the learning style and personality of your child.For example, if you have a child that is quiet by nature, then a full immersion class might be overwhelming and may cause them to withdraw verbally.
 From the first day of class, make sure that you stay in contact with your child’s teachers. Write notes for your child to deliver with any questions that you have over homework or class activities. Send emails if that is preferred. Stop by the classroom before you pick-up your child. Don’t waste their time with random visits, but stay in touch., Offer to serve in the classroom on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. You can spend multiple hours, or just a single one, helping out. Talk to your child’s teacher about your skill set and how you can be of assistance.Be aware that you don’t have to help out directly with the language program in order to benefit your child. By simply being in the classroom, you may provide them with much needed confidence and support.
 Many dual language programs struggle to find funding for activities and educational materials. Join the PTA and offer suggestions about how you can help raise monies for the program and classrooms. This will also provide you with an opportunity to talk with other parents about the program and your child’s performance., If your child is participating in a small language program, in an otherwise large institution, it could possibly make them feel isolated from the general student population. Counter this feeling by encouraging them to participate in larger school activities and events, such as celebrations or sporting events. You can go along with them to show your support and enthusiasm.

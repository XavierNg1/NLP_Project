 Hair extensions will look great and can provide a few shades difference in color (or a whole new color if you're really daring!). Be sure to clip them in properly. But, these are very risky and fall out, causing even more damage to your natural hair. Also, professional hair extensions look way better than the ones you get from Claire's. If you want to get natural looking hair extensions versus the just clip them in ones, get it professionally glued in.

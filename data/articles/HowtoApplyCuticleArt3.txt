 Clean your nails and wipe away any old polish. Trim and file them down to a shape that pleases you. If you have an unsteady hand, apply some petroleum jelly to the skin around your nails., Start by applying the base coat to the very tips of your nails. Add another coat over your entire nail. Let the base coat dry before moving on., Get some French tip guide stickers. Place them, upside down, onto your nail, about 0.3 to 0.4 centimeters from the cuticle.If you don't find any French tip stickers, you could use the round stickers meant for reinforcing binder paper.
 Flat colors work best here, but you can also try a metallic gold, silver, or copper. You may need to apply two coats, depending on how sheer the nail polish is., Be careful not to smudge the polish as you do so. It's best to remove the stickers while the polish is still wet, however, otherwise you risk chipping it., At this point, you can consider your manicure done. If you'd like something fancier, you could add some glitter to the cuticle area, then seal it in with more top coat.Use the same color glitter as nail polish.
For a twist, you could try tiny rhinestones instead.
 Take a close look at your nail. Use a thin brush dipped in nail polish remover to wipe away any nail polish that got onto your skin. If you applied petroleum jelly earlier, be sure to wipe it off. After this, you are ready to go and flaunt you nails!

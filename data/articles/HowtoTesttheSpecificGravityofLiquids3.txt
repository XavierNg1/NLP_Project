 The density of a substance is equal to its mass divided by its volume. You can measure the mass on a scale and record the volume of the liquid used. Use the equation "m / v = D" where m is mass in grams or kilograms, v is volume in milliliters or liters, and D is density.For example, if you had a sample that was eight grams and nine milliliters, your equation would be "8.00 g / 9.00 mL = 0.89 g/mL".

Weigh an empty container first and record its weight. Next, fill your container with the desired liquid and weigh it again. The mass of your liquid is equal to the second measurement minus the first.
 Between -10 degrees Celsius and +30 degrees Celsius, the density of water can be rounded to 1.00 (assuming three significant figures). If you are using liquids that do not fall in that temperature range, you can measure the mass and the volume of your water and calculate the density. Alternatively, you can often find charts with the density of water at different temperatures., Substances expand when they are heated and contract when they are cooled. Since density is a measure of how much mass is in a given volume, the measurement is changed by the expansion and contraction due to temperature. If you want to get accurate specific gravity calculations, it is necessary that the liquid you are measuring and the water that you are using as a comparison are both at the same temperature., The units will cancel out in this equation, leaving you with a unitless quantity. That number is the specific gravity (or relative density) of your liquid. The ratio used will be "Dl / Dwater‚Äù where Dl is the density of your liquid and Dwater is the density of your water.For example, if you were to take the density of acetone (0.787 g/mL @ 25 degrees C) and divide it by the density of water (1.00 g/mL @ 25 degrees C), you would get 0.787g/mL/1.00g/mL=0.787{\displaystyle 0.787g/mL/1.00g/mL=0.787}.

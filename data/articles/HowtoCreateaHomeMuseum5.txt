 Maybe even put some of the objects in the diorama.
 For animals you can buy replica or even real skeletons to use. ThenÂ place a thick layer of clay all over the skeleton and texture it to resemble skin and muscle. You could use real animal hair for fur.
 For rocks, sculpt plasticine clay and paint it to look like the real thing. Doing this or using real plants, would be good for trees and vegetation.
 If the diorama is at the center of you exhibit and there is not wall, you can skip this step. For the background use a large removable canvas and acrylic or spray paint. Paint mountains, more trees, rocks, and other animals in the background.

 Since it is typically recommended to wear safety gear when you are skating, you should have knees pads on already. To perform this stop, slowly lower one knee to the ground and allow it to drag. This is a good stopping technique for beginners as it takes very little skill to perform. You donâ€™t want to rely on it, just use it as a backup when necessary., Since inline skates typically have a heel brake and quad skates have toe stops, these are a basic, common way to stop. Both brakes are best used with your legs scissored, one forward and one back. To use the heel brake, the skate with the heel brake should be forward. Lift your front foot toes and gently apply pressure to the brake. To use toe stops, lift your back leg heel and apply pressure to the toe stop., Plant one foot and allow the other foot to trace a wide circle around your body. This transfers your motion from forward to circular movement, which slows you down to a stop while keeping you fixed in one location. This is most effective if you plant your dominant foot and allow your non-dominant foot to trace the circle around you. This is also an effective movement if you just want to slow down and not come to a complete stop.

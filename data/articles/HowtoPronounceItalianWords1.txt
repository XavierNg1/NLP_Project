vowels (vocale /vo-ka-le/),
consonants (consonante /kon-so-nan-te/),
double (doppio /dop-pjo/) consonants,
silent (muto /mu-to/).;
, Some vowels come as diphthong similar to American pronunciation of letter 'a' in "hand," contrasted with British (diphthongs are also called as double vowels).
 For example,


'e' in English word "mate" is not pronounced, but it is a hint to contrast it with mat. In English this hint already was in the form of a diphthong, "mayt" which still exists in "Cockney" British accent.
The same 'e' in Italian "pane" (bread /pa-ne/) keeps 'a' without hint and is pronounced independently: 'a' like 'a' in English "car" and 'e' sounds like 'a' in English "pay".



Few words end to u.
Few words end to a consonant.
In Italian words there is no j, k, w, x, y.

These letters might be used to express pronunciation of words in international phonetics symbols. Do not confuse them with Italian alphabets.

 Offer to take the elderly people's bags if they are too heavy for them. Give a lost neighbour directions. People will remember you as a nice girl and know you are there to help.;
, If you see some little kids that are bored, ask what's up. If you know a good solution, go ahead and let them know. Give someone a compliment on what they're wearing but don't be too giving with compliments, or people will think you're not honest.
 It will earn people's respect. Nobody likes a liar.
 This doesn't mean wear a suit and heels everywhere. Just make sure you're clean and tidy.
 You don't want to be known as the nice girl that people avoid because you stink!

, Say "Good morning" to elders, or a "Hi!" and a smile to your close mates.

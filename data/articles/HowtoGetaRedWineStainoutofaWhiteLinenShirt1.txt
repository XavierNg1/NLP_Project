 Act quickly. Immediately after the stain happens, go change into something else and take off your linen shirt. Make sure that as you are taking off the shirt, you do not touch any other part of the shirt to the stained section. This could spread the stain to other parts of the shirt. , Lay the shirt out on a flat, even surface. If the shirt is stained on the front, roll up the back of the shirt so that the stain does not spread through the front of the shirt onto the back. You can also slip a towel in the shirt between the front and back to prevent spreading.
 Take a clean cloth or paper towel and blot gently at the shirt. Make sure not to rub or scrub the shirt. This could cause the stain to get ingrained into the shirt and make it harder to get out. If the stained area is big, start from the outside, working your way towards the center. This way, you can contain the stain and keep it from spreading., After you have already absorbed all you can with a dry cloth, try dabbing the shirt with a dampened cloth. The moisture from the damp cloth prevents the stain from setting and can help you absorb the spilled wine.

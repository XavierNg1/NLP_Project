 Kittens need to be weaned off mother’s milk and onto solid foods before adoption both for their health and to avoid bad habits like “wool sucking,” where cat’s chew and suck on things like fabric.The mother cat will wean her kittens on her own, usually by 8-10 weeks. If you are adopting a kitten before then, you will need to accelerate the weaning process:, At 4 weeks, you can start putting the kitten by herself for a few hours at a time. Put her in a space with her own litter box, food, and water bowl.
 Put your finger just below the surface of a bowl of milk. The kitten will attempt to suckle your finger, but will then find it (instinctively) easier to lap at your finger, rather than suck.Do not give the kitten cow’s milk, as this may upset their digestive system.
 Once the kitten can lap up milk, it is time to introduce moist solid foods. You’ll want to start with a gruel-like consistency and slowly remove moisture until by 8-10 weeks, the kitten is eating dry food.To make the gruel, mix dry or canned kitten food with milk replacer until it is the consistency of oatmeal.
Each day, gradually decrease the amount of milk replace until by week 6, the food is only lightly moistened.
Sometime between weeks 8 and 10, the kitten should be eating dry food.

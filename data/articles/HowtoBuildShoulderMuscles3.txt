 This workout is similar to the standard lateral raise, except that you are bent over forward. You can perform this routine while standing, or you can sit on a press bench and lean over your knees.Try resting your forehead on the bench or another padded surface to help keep it steady.
 Hold your chest up and keep your back flat. If you are sitting, bend forward over your knees until your forehead nearly touches the bench. If you are standing, then bend forward from your hips to bring your chest parallel with the floor. Let the dumbbells hang beneath your chest. Keep your elbows slightly bent, and let your palms face each other., Lift the dumbbells up and out until your upper arms are nearly parallel to the floor. Raise your arms in a steady arc, and make sure that you are not favoring one over the other. Hold the weights at the top of the arc for a moment before slowly lowering them toward the starting position.Start the next rep just before your arms hang perpendicular to the floor.

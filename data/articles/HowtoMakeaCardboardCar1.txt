, The lines should begin at the halfway point lengthwise and drop down, so their flat side is along the top of the box.
 Use a box cutter to cut along the lines you've traced.









Have an adult do this step, and all other steps involving the box cutter.

Don't cut the piece out entirely. Be sure to leave this flap attached to the hood (the front third).
 Lift the flap you've just cut and fold it halfway down, towards the interior of the car. Tape the top fold to the bottom half to secure the windshield.
 Use the box cutter to cut a large rectangle out of the folded section from Step 5.
,, Glue two cups to the front of the car so that their base is attached and the wider lip faces out. You can use paper or plastic cups.

Cut the lower part of the cup. This part will form the headlights.
 Get some Popsicle sticks and form the grill.









Add a divider on the windshield.
Obtain some bottle caps and form the taillights and signal lights.
 Glue two paper plates along the length of each side for wheels.









Alternatively, cut out circles from construction paper and glue or tape them to the front., Use finger or tempera paints for a custom design, and add in details with markers.
 Glue in construction paper or fabric for upholstery, and add another paper plate to the "dashboard" as the steering wheel.

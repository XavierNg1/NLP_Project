 As listed above, you should only clean mushrooms with a brush or a dry towel. Don’t use water, as water logging the mushrooms may cause outside mold or fungi to grow. Cut the mushrooms into slices 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick.
 Try this method for preserving mushrooms only on sunny days with very low humidity. If there is too much humidity in the air, it will take much longer for the mushrooms to dry and mold may begin to grow.
 Possibilities include sunny rooms, windowsills, or flat rooftops that have air circulation. Pick a spot where birds, animals, bugs, and moisture can't touch the mushrooms., There are two options for this. You can either lay the mushrooms on a drying rack, or you can string them up with cooking string.On a drying rack: Lay the mushrooms flat in one layer. Make sure that none of them are overlapping as they might get stuck together while drying, or may warp into weird shapes. Cover the mushrooms and drying rack in a ‘net tent’ which you can get at most kitchen supply stores. The net tent will keep the bugs away. If you don’t have a net tent, you can simply use a piece of mesh fabric draped over and under the dry rack and mushrooms.With cooking string: Lace the cooking string through the mushrooms. You can use a sterilized needle to do this. Simply run the needle through a flame to sterilize it. Then string the mushrooms along the string as if you were making a bead necklace.
 If you are using the cooking string method, hang them somewhere dry and in the sun. Allow the mushrooms to dry in the sun for one or two days. Check their progress several times each day.


Consider finishing the mushrooms in the oven if they aren't totally dry after approximately two days in the sun. Read Method One of this article to learn how to do this.

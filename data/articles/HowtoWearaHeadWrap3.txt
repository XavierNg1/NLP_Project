 A long rectangular scarf is ideal for this style because you will need plenty of fabric to create the look. If youâ€™re unsure that the scarf is big enough, you can test it by wrapping it around your head and seeing how much fabric is leftover. There should be enough fabric leftover to twist and wrap around your head., Center the scarf at the nape of your neck so that the ends hang down evenly. The scarf should not be folded. The scarf should be covering most of your head and hair, except part of the very front of your hair., Take the ends in your hands and hold them out straight in front of you. Begin twisting the ends together as if you were twisting a towel. Start by twisting the ends directly in front of you. Once you have twisted enough, begin bringing the twist around the middle of the crown of your head.
 Continue twisting until you have very little fabric left to twist. The twisting should end around the front of your head. Then, tuck the ends into the area where you first started to twist.

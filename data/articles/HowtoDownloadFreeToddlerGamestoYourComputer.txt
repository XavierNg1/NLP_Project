 Try searching for something like “download free toddler games”; this should give you a good variety of results.


If you want to narrow your search, you can add a term like “educational” to your query. You can also search for specific types of games, such as ones that have to do with music or counting. Or you can just do a broad search first, and then look among the results for the type of game that you want.
You can also narrow your search depending on your operating system, since some games may be available on Windows but not Mac, or vice versa, or may be available for other operating systems.
You might also consider narrowing your search by age, since there may be games that are designed more for, say, three-year-olds than one-year-olds. You may have more success finding good games for your child if you search for games recommended specifically for their age.;

 Many of the sites where you can download toddler games offer user reviews. Look for the sites that have high ratings from previous users, and also browse comments wherever they are available. This will help you decide if a particular game is right for you and your child.

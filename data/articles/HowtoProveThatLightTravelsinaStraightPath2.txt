 This experiment will use the reflection of light on objects to show how light moves in a straight line. You need to conduct this experiment with someone else, as one person will hold the flashlight and one person will hold the mirror. You will need the following supplies:Two to three sheets of black paper.
A flashlight.
A small mirror.
Small objects like buttons, bottle caps, or dimes.
 Lay the black paper down on the ground in a lowly lit room or, if possible, a dark room. Then, place two to three small objects in the center of the paper.
 The person with the flashlight will sit in front of the objects with her back to the objects.The other person will hold the small mirror so it is facing the objects.
 The person will then turn on the flashlight so it is shining away from the objects.


The other person will use the small mirror to reflect the flashlight so it hits the objects. Move close to the light, at an angle, to catch the light so it hits the objects.
You may need to position more than one mirror to create a light path that shines on the objects. Play around with reflecting the light on the mirrors until the light hits the objects. You can also move the objects around the room to create a more complicated light path, using the flashlight as the light source.
This experiment shows that light travels in a straight line in the air. But it also bounces off of a reflective surface, like a mirror. The angle of the light as it bounces off the mirror will be the same as the angle of the light as it hits the mirror. The mirror reflects the light and changes its path from a straight line to an angled straight line.

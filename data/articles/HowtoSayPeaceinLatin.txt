 Latin, as the language that dominated European thought and culture for over a thousand years, has a wide vocabulary. The word usually given is "pax," but if you are looking to express the idea of tranquil, tranquility, or calm, then it would be better to go with tranquillitas (the noun quietness, stillness, or calm). In a political or religious context, pax is the word you ought to use.;
, Just like with some English words, such as "who" and "whom," the form a word takes in Latin demonstrates the role it plays in a sentence. Latin words, however, can take many more forms that English words can in showing nuances of meaning that English can't. In English, we usually just show whether a word is singular or plural (if there is one or if there is more than one). Latin does not rely on word order the way English does, but instead reveals information through the form it takes. Because this isn't a Latin grammar, the following explanations are overly simplified but should suit basic requirements.
 --> PAX.
 --> PACIS.
 in English... "I offer my life to peace." --> PACI.
 --> PACEM.
 --> PACE. Note that when we use the word "with" in English to mean "along with" or "accompanying," the form PACE is also used--but you will also need to use the word cum to show that it is meant in that sense. This is why we see the -cum ending in the vobiscum of "pax vobisbum." Latin is a funny language that does not care about word order as much as English does! The exact same sentence could be written: "Pax cum vobis."

, --> PACES. To be honest, I don't know how often you would need to say something like this, because in English "peace" as a concept is usually only ever used in the singular. But if you find yourself needing to express the idea of different peaces as the subject of a sentence, you would do it with PACES.
 --> PACUM. Again, I'm not sure where you would use this form in a real-word context, but if you need it, there you have it!

, in English... "I offer my life to the peaces." --> PACIBUS.
 --> PACES. Again, not a form usually used with "peace." If you're having trouble grasping it, compare these two sentences: "He loves the dog" and "He loves the dogs."

, --> PACIBUS. The same tip about the wordcum applies here as well.

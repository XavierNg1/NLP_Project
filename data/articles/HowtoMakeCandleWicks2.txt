 Use scissors to trim down the length of the balsa wood so that it stands at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) taller than the container you plan to use for the candle.


Use the thin balsa wood strips you'd typically find at a craft store. These sticks should be 1/2 to 1-1/2 inches (1.25 to 3.75 cm) wide.
If you don't have a container in mind and don't know how large the candle will be, trim the wood down to a length between 6 and 12 inches (15.25 and 30.5 cm). You can trim away any excess later, so it's better to have too much than too little.
 Place the trimmed balsa wood into a shallow dish. Pour enough room temperature olive oil into the dish to completely cover the wood.


While wood is flammable on its own, coating the wood in oil will allow the fire to catch quicker and burn more evenly. Olive oil burns cleanly, making it a great choice for candle-making projects.
Let the wood soak up the oil for at least 20 minutes. You can wait up to one hour, if desired, so that the wood can absorb more oil and burn with an even brighter flame.
 Remove the wooden sticks from the oil and use clean paper towels to wipe away any excess.


Instead of rubbing the stick dry, you could place it on a plate covered with paper towels and allow it to air dry for several minutes.
When ready, the wood should still feel damp and slightly oily to the touch, but it should no longer leave an oily residue on your hands when you handle it.
 Pry open a metal wick tab and carefully push one end of the treated wood into the opening.


Push the wick into the tab as far as possible. The wick tab will hold the wood firmly in place as it sits in the melted wax during the candle-making process.
 The wooden wick should now be ready to use when you make your candle.


Treated balsa wood is easy to handle and burns well. Using wooden wicks instead of cotton ones will add a wooded scent to the candle as it burns, and wooden wicks may also make the occasional crackling sound as the fire consumes them.

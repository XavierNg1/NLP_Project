 Because you are creating a visual book, you should consider using a sketchbook to do your brainstorming. You may sit down with a sketchbook and plan out the illustrations of the book as you write the content.


If you are not a great sketch artists, you may draw simple illustrations of what you would like for each page of the book. You could then work with a professional illustrator to achieve higher quality drawings for the children's picture book.
 You can also use technology to your advantage by using a drawing tool on your computer. You may use sketching software to create illustrations for the book or as a way to try out different illustration styles.


You may want to learn how to use certain illustration software, like Adobe Illustrator or Adobe Photoshop.
 Another way you can keep a record of your ideas is to use a tape recorder to record yourself talking about a concept or a theme. You may keep the recorder with you and take it out whenever you have an idea or a thought about the picture book. You could then play back the recording later and see if you any of your ideas are worth exploring further.

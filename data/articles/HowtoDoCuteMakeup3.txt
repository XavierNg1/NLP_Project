 Use black, violet, brown or other cute colors. Start at the inner corner of your upper lid, and run eyeliner along the top of the lid where your eyelashes start until you have a clean line along the line of your eye.


Using liquid eyeliner might give you a cleaner finish, but might be more difficult for a beginner to use cleanly. Beginners should consider: pencil, felt tip, or gel eyeliner., Depending on your eye shape, you may need to thicken your line with your applicator. To blend your line to fit the contours of your lid, keep the part of the line closest to the inside of your eye thinner than the rest.
 From the outer end of your line, draw a tiny 45 degree angle to the end of your new line for the opposite lid. Fill in the little triangle you have formed, being careful not to over apply, and start the opposite lid.
 Lightly apply a bit of black eye liner along the lower lid of your eye. Be sure not to apply too thick a line, as this could give a harsh, intense appearance.

 During summer, one of the best activities to do with friends is to go swimming. You can also swim in lakes or rivers if you live near them.


While you are swimming, play pool games like sharks and minnows or Marco Polo.Have diving or cannonball contests.
 Bowling alleys are great places to hang out at any time of year with your friends. You can even create fun names for your bowling teams.
 Arcades are fun places to go with your friends, as they have games for everyone.


Challenge your friends to see who can do best at each game.
If youâ€™re at an arcade where you can win tickets, pool your tickets together when you are finished playing so you can get a better prize.
 Pick a movie that you all want to see.


If you can, try to go to a matinee showing of the movie. They are cheaper, and there will be fewer people in the theatre.
Bring a bag with your own snacks, as movie theatre snacks can get expensive. If you want to buy snacks, share a large popcorn with your friends to make it more affordable.
 It can be fun to plan in advance to attend these types of events with your friends. Look in local newspapers and online to see the schedule of events for the next few months in your city.

 You may struggle to concentrate with many distractions around you: the chatter of co-workers, the noisy printer, and other stimuli that may draw your attention away from work. To help eliminate distractions, choose a workspace far from loud areas, such as the breakroom.Move your desk away from the printer, wear headphones, or use high partitions between desks.
 If you become easily overwhelmed by work, have difficulty focusing, or have difficulty starting or following through on tasks, arrange your projects throughout the day. Work on one task at a time, and break down large items into smaller, more manageable parts.Allot time in your day for breaks and relaxation. Otherwise, you may lose steam or become distracted. Work for 20 minutes, take a 5 minute break, and then work for another 20 minutes.
 It can be easy to say “yes” too many times in an effort to please your boss or get in line for a promotion. However, don’t let work creep into your personal life. You may choose to not check work-related emails or phone calls once you leave the office, or to turn off your work phone during dinner. Whatever you do, make sure you have some space between work life and personal life so you don’t get burned out or over stressed.It’s up to you to determine what boundaries you create, but it’s important not to feel like a slave to your job by constantly answering your phone or responding to emails.
 If you feel overwhelmed at work or have difficulty getting through the day, consider decreasing your hours.Talk to human resources and/or your manager to discuss adjusting your schedule in order to maintain positive mental health. Consider how many hours you feel you can complete each week, and discuss it with your workplace.

 If you have programs that need unrestricted access to specific ports, you’ll need to open them up through your router’s configuration page. In order to open ports, you’ll need to know the IP address for the device running the program.


To check the IP address of your computer, see this guide.
To see a list of devices connected to your router and their respective IP addresses, click the Status tab and then select Local Network. Click the DHCP Client Table button to see the list., On a blank line in the “Port Range Forwarding” section of the Applications & Gaming tab, enter in the information for the program you want to forward ports for. In the Application field, enter the name of the application. You can enter whatever you’d like, this is for your reference.
 Only type in a port if instructed to by the application. Open ports can pose a security threat to your network. If you are only opening one port, enter the same value in both the “Start” and “End” fields.
 Your application may tell you which specific protocol (TCP or UDP) the open port needs to be set for. If you are unsure, select Both.
 This is the address for the device that is running the application. You will only need to enter the digits from the last group of the IP address.
 Once you have finished entering all of the information, check the “Enabled” box to turn on the new rule. Scroll down and click the “Save Settings” button to restart the router and apply it.

 You can purchase earthworms or you can take them from your worm farm and add them to the soil.;
, You'll be wanting to keep your earthworms and not have them simply slide over to the neighbour's, so improve the desirability of the soil for them.


Let the leaf litter accumulate on the ground surface.
Add mulch to the surface.
Bury kitchen scraps in the soil. These holes are best about 10 centimeter (3.9 in)-20 centimeter (7.9 in) in depth. Do this all over the garden, a different spot every time.
 Even water the soil. Keeping the soil moist will make it more desirable for the earthworms to live in.
 The less digging, the better. Just dig enough to get new plants in. Let the earthworms do all the soil churning and turning.
 Use organic, homemade sprays and don't spray pesticides, fungicides or other toxic substances on the soil.

 Luckily, legibility is not usually a problem, but if you aren't using actual words, this will obviously create problems.;
, Just like everywhere in life, knowing the right word for the situation is vital to being understood. For example, saying, "Oh man, that stinks," "ARRGH!" or "!@#$" is different from saying, "Well, that is an unfortunate situation," "Quite a predicament," or "Well, I can sympathize."

, If you type in capital letters all the time, it will just be like regular typing to those who read it. However, using capitalization as a substitute for say, underlining will give a better impact on the reader.
 It sounds obvious, butÂ :) usually sounds better than "yes!"

, Think about how what you are typing will affect the person to whom it is directed. You may be really mad at Johnny323, but saying "I hate your guts, Johnny323!" is probably not the best idea. They may play it off as if it meant nothing to them ("Noob"),but chances are, it did. Say something like "Why do you say that, Johnny?" or "That was pretty mean." If this doesn't help, see Steps 7 and 8.
 This isn't true if you're in a small "clan," "group," or "club," but usually, it is.
 Most sites have a "block" feature that blocks all content from the blocked user. This is particularly useful if anyone is cussing all over the place, insulting you, or just being particularly annoying.
 If you are offended by over half of the people in the chat room you are in or no one sees the point that you are trying to get across, log off. Be polite ("I'm going to leave.") but be quick. This is a quick and easy solution to most problems. If your conversation isn't benefiting you or anyone else, log off. It's better for both of you.

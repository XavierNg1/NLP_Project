 In order to broil food, the oven rack must be about 4-7 inches from the heat element in the ceiling of the oven.


If your broiler is a compartment underneath your oven, then you can skip this step., Most broilers just turn on or off. You can’t control the temperature the way you do with normal oven cooking. Turn it on and let it preheat for about 10 minutes.
 Cover the broiler pan with aluminum foil and place the brats on the pan. Make sure there is a little room around each brat. Line them up to be perpendicular to the grates on the broiler pan.


You can also use a cast-iron skillet instead of a broiler pan.Be sure to rotate the brats every 5 minutes to prevent them burning on one side.
 Place the broiler pan on an oven rack and close the oven. Let the brats cook for about 5 minutes.Turn them over and cook them for another 5 minutes.
 Remove the brats from the oven. Use a meat thermometer to check the temperature of the bratwurst. The bratwurst should reach 160 °F (71 °C). Stick the tip of the thermometer into one bratwurst and let the thermometer sit for a minute.


The brats will also have brown stripes from the grates on the broiler pan.

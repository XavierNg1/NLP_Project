 When you rewrite your notes, you are reiterating information that you are already familiar with. This repetition can help you recall information from the notes more effectively. Try writing a copy of your notes before an exam or quiz to help you remember the information., It’s okay to copy someone else’s notes once in a while, but you should put them into words and phrases that make sense to you. Putting information into your own words can help you remember the important stuff later on., Creating an outline from class notes and materials is an active way to study your notes and other materials from the class. Try taking your lecture notes and making an outline of the information you took down in class. You can also incorporate information from your textbook in the outline.

 If your dog feels overcrowded, either by living in a confined space or being forced to share his space with other dogs without having space of his own, abnormal behaviors can arise. In particular, male dogs will fight over territory if they feel crowded., Poor fencing that allows your dog to slip out can result in destructive behaviors including car chasing, fighting with other dogs, and potentially attacking people. In many jurisdictions, you are required by law to ensure that your dog is properly restrained and you'll be held liable for your dog's bad behavior., Get a kennel for your dog to use when you're not home, and to sleep in. To get your dog used to his "safe space", put him in it throughout the day while you are going about your daily routine, and at night for sleeping. The goal is for the dog to know that his kennel is his safe place, and its time to calm down once in his inside. Remember, never use the kennel as punishment.


Kennels are great training tools for puppies and young dogs. You can train them to spend time in their little confined space. They cannot do any damage there. As long as you don't leave them in there for too long, they'll learn to love their crate.

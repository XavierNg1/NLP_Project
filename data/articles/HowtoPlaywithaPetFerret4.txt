 Similar to digging, any toy or game that simulates tunneling is a hit with ferrets. There are specific tunnel toys designed for ferrets carried at most pet stores. Also, tunnelÂ toys designed for cats can work work well for ferrets.
 Ferrets will crawl underneath to satisfy their digging instinct. The more wrinkly you make the blanket or towel the more fun it is for your ferret to navigate.
 Piles of clothes, toys, boxes, or plastic bags are fun for your ferret. All of these items allow the ferret to explore and tunnel around.

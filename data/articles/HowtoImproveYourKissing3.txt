 A dry mouth can lead to bad breath and sticky lips. Make sure to drink enough fluids daily to ensure that your lips are smooth and your breath is kissable., More importantly, don't take your partner on a date to a restaurant that serves bad breath-inducing foods. Some common trigger foods are:


Garlic.
Onions.
Tuna or sardines.
Spicy foods.
Coffee.
Alcohol., While this tip may be a given for most, there are some people who neglect to accept the basic premises of good hygiene. Make sure to brush and floss twice daily to remove any bacteria build up in your mouth. Bacteria causes bad breath. Rinse with mouthwash for an added boost of freshness.
 Especially after consuming any food, make sure to pop a mint or chew some gum before kissing someone. If you choose to chew gum, make sure to spit it out before you start kissing. Your partner doesn't want to eat your leftover gum, and gum can also cause you to choke while kissing.

, Under the Sign In box, type in your Gmail email address and password. This is your one Google ID for all of Google’s services, including Google Docs. Click the “Sign in” button to proceed.
 Upon logging in, you will be brought to the main directory. If you already have existing documents, you can see and access them from here.
 Click the large red circle with a plus sign on the lower right corner. A new tab will open with the web-based word processor.


If you want to view or edit an existing document, just double-click on it from the main directory. A new tab will open with the contents of the document.
 You can start typing or editing your document. There’s a menu and a toolbar on the header with functions very similar to those on MS Word.
 There’s no need to save with Google Docs. Everything you do is automatically saved at regular intervals. You still need to properly name your document though. The current name of the document is displayed on the top left corner. If you’re working on a new document, the title is just “Untitled document.” Click on the current name and a small window will appear. Type in the new name of the document here and click the “OK” button. You will see the name immediately change.
 If you’re done with your current document, you can just simply close the window or tab. Everything is saved. You can access your document from Google Docs or Google Drive.

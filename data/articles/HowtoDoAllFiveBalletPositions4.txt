 From fifth position, move the front foot out a slight amount with about a foot of distance between them.


Fourth position with the legs is one of the main preparation for a pirouette or a ballet turn.
 Keeping the rounded arm in the same shape, lift it up above the head.


Forth position arms are one arm in the coin position, but just below the belly button, and the other above the head but forward enough that you can still see it. The high arm should also be in the coin position.

 Place the pan over medium heat and heat the oil until it begins to shimmer., Saut√© the onions and peppers, stirring occasionally, until the onions become translucent and the peppers soft. This should take about five minutes.
 Stir them in with the onions and garlic and cook for about three minutes, until the mushrooms are soft and have yielded their liquid.
 If you add the garlic too soon, it will burn; it only needs to cook for a minute once the vegetables have been cooked.
 Once the vegetables are cooked, the rest of the ingredients will be combined in a food processor.
 Be careful, since the contents of the pan will still be piping hot.
 Pour in the beans, ketchup, mayonnaise, soy sauce, bread crumbs, rice and spices.
 Just a few pulses should suffice. You want the texture to resemble ground beef. Take care not to over process the mix, since this will result in a runny batter.
 Use a spoon to scoop out the mixture and form it into palm-sized patties with your hands. Make the patties large enough to fit on standard hamburger buns.
 Allow the oil to get nice and hot; it's ready when it begins to shimmer.
 Place the patties in the pan and fry them on each side for two to three minutes, or until the exterior becomes brown and crispy.
 They're delicious on hamburger buns with all the classic fixings: ketchup, mustard, pickles, lettuce and tomato.

Cut the rack of ribs into sections of 3 or 4 ribs and lay them flat in the bottom of the crock pot. Add 1/2 cup (120 ml) water or chicken stock. Cover the ribs with 2 thinly sliced cloves of garlic and 1 small onion, sliced thin.

Using tongs, carefully remove the ribs from the crock pot and place them on a cookie sheet. Brush the ribs with your favorite sauce. Place them under the broiler and broil them for about 5 to 8 minutes per side or until lightly browned. Serve.

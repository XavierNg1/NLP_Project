 Smiling has been shown to give people a better impression of you. When you smile, you show that you’re friendly and confident. If you want to make a good impression on someone you admire, it’s best to smile when you meet them., One of the key strategies for keeping calm when you’re nervous for any reason is simply to breathe and focus on your breathing. Your heart will naturally slow down and you’ll feel calmer., When nervous, we tend to speed up our speech, and this can cause another person to miss what we say. When talking to someone you like, you won’t want them to miss what you say. Speed-talking will make you seem nervous. Just repeat to yourself, “Slow down. It’s going to be okay.”, Making eye contact will make them feel as though you’re paying attention.You’ll want to keep a good posture by standing with your back straight and your arms at your side. If you’re meeting this person for the first time, be careful not to act overly familiar by waving as though you know them., In addition to helping you keep calm, paying attention to what they are saying will allow you to have something intelligent to say back. You may find yourself getting lost in anxiety or overthinking what you want to say to them. If that happens, think to yourself, “Listen.” This should help you return to the moment., By asking open questions, you can get to know who they really are, not just your impression of them. It's okay to be quiet and listen while they talk. Give yourself time to think about an open question they've asked. You might say, "Let me think about that for a second." As long as you answer the question openly and honestly, such a response won't make you seem like you're dodging something uncomfortable.It's also perfectly okay to set boundaries when they ask something you don't feel comfortable asking. You can say something like, "I appreciate how curious you are, but I'm not really comfortable answering that right now."

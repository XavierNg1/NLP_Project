 You don't want a box that's too small. That's just uncomfortable! Make sure the box is much bigger than your cat, so he/she can move around a little, and it'll be comfortable!;
, This must be large enough to enable your cat to fit through. Make sure it's not too small. Also, you can make it much bigger than him/her because your cat will get bigger as it gets older.
 It'll be cute and show that it's your cat's box and "home." Add cute things like stickers that are cats, mice, fish, etc. Don't add things that your cat could bite off and choke on. You could add pictures of your cat and other cats.
 Staple or glue on soft pieces of felt or other scrap materials that are soft.You could use a small pillow, blankets, towels, rags, or any old, unused clothes. These will be comfortable. You could make a little cushion by putting old clothes, towels, blankets, rags, etc. in a pillowcase and sewing the open end.
 Put two medium cushions inside on top. Your cat will love it! He/she will thank you with love! You can do this for all cats, any shape and size. Have fun with your cat and his/her new "cat cave."

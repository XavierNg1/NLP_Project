 You'll need a 14", 7", 6", and three 4" terra cotta saucers. You'll also need 6" and 4" flower pots, a fountain pump, 1/2" rubber tubing, silicone sealant, clear spray sealant, a round file, and a drill with a masonry bit., Spray the inside of the 14" saucer with the spray sealant. Do three coats in total, with dry time between them.
 Soak the rest of the flower pots and saucers to make them easier to shape and drill. Drill a 1/2" hole for the rubber tubing in the 7" saucer, with a wood block underneath it for support. Then file four notches in the lips of the 6" pot and one of the 4" saucers. File downward angle large notches in the 7", 6", and one of the 4" saucers. These will be the downspouts.
 With the pump on the 14" saucer, attach the rubber tube to the pump and then then side it up through the hole at the bottom of the 6" pot (with the pot upside down). Arrange the pot so that the cord for the pump goes through one of the notches on the lip of the pot. Now place the 7" saucer on top, facing up. Trim the extra tube, leave about a 1/2", and then seal the edges around the tube with silicone.
 Place the 4" flower pot upside down and top it with the 6" saucer, and the 4" saucer with the lip on top of the 4" saucer with no cuts. Arrange the saucers and pots so that the downspouts pour into each other. Finally, place the 4" saucer with the notches upside down so that it covers the hole with the tube.


Water should flow up from the bottom, pour out the 7" saucer, into the 6" saucer, into the 4" saucer, and then back into the 14" saucer so that the process can start again. The notches allow for water flow, so if you're having circulation problems, try making the notches bigger.
You may need to stabilize the fountain by gluing these components together, or by lashing them down with twine.
 Fill your saucers with river stones or other flow-friendly materials, and then add plants or other decorations to your fountain. Enjoy!

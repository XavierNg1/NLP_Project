 Beat the egg with a whisk in a separate jug or container, then pour in half of the beaten egg into the mixture while mixing into mixture with hand.
 Add the second half of the beaten egg in to start making the dough. Don't overmix, otherwise the dough will become too sticky.
 When you have your dough, roll it out into a sausage shape, then slice up into 9-10 pieces.
 Lay out the pieces on a greased baking tray, but space them out so there is enough room for the cookies to spread out.
 In each cookie, press your thumb in to make a small circular shape, then pour your flavored jam into each circular dent.
 Place your thumbprint cookies into the oven and have it bake for 10-15 minutes, until they are golden brown.
 Transfer onto a cooling rack and leave to cool for 10 minutes, then enjoy your yummy thumbprint cookies!

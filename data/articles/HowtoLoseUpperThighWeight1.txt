 Since there’s no easy way to spot reduce, burning total body fat will help you reduce the fat on your upper thighs. If you’re overweight, start by reducing your daily calorie intake by 250 to 500 calories per day.


Cutting 500 calories a day will result in losing one pound a week (3,500 calories is one pound). But remember: That's not including the calories you'll be burning with your increased workout regimen.;
, The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) recommends that adults limit their total dietary fat to 20 to 35 percent of their daily calorie intake. Since one gram of fat equals nine calories, a 2,000 calorie diet should consist of 44 to 78 grams of fat per day.



The DASH eating plan (for lowering cholesterol) recommends a daily dietary fat intake of 27 percent of total calories (60 grams of fat per day for a 2,000 calorie diet). Try to include healthy (unsaturated) fats when possible while limiting saturated fats. Foods that are high in unsaturated fat include vegetable oils, such as olive and canola oils, nuts, seeds, and avocados.
 Most Americans don’t consume the recommended 21 to 38 grams of fiber per day. High-fiber foods are beneficial for weight loss because they are typically low in fat and calories and high in nutrients (such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes). Fiber also helps you feel more full and satisfied, for longer periods of time. Getting plenty of fiber in your diet will help you lose weight (and body fat) at a faster pace.


High-fiber foods generally require more chewing time, which gives your body time to register when you're no longer hungry, so you're less likely to overeat. And high-fiber diets also tend to be less "energy dense," which means they have fewer calories for the same volume of food.

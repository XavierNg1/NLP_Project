 Fatty fish like salmon can provide excellent nutrients for maintaining proper brain health and even improving focus.


Getting your omega-3 fatty acids straight from fish also provides you with the protein and nutrients found in these lean, nutritious additions to a healthy diet.
 Olive oil, flaxseed oil, and sunflower oil are all naturally rich in omega-3â€™s.


Try using them in place of butter for frying fish or veggies, or substitute these oils for store-bought salad dressings by pairing them with cider vinegar.
 Walnuts, Brazil nuts, almonds, peanuts, cashews, and many other nuts are packed with antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids that make them a powerhouse snack for maintaining mental health.


These diet beauties are rich in minerals that can also relieve insomnia and promote a stable mood, so add them to salads or combine them with dried cherries for a healthy brain snack.

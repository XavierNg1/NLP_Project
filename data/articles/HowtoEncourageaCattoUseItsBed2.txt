 Cats don’t like soiled environments or strange smells, so you should make sure the bed is clean before introducing your cat to it. If your cat avoids a new bed even though you’ve placed it in a good sleeping spot, it might not like the way the new bed smells. If your cat suddenly stops using a bed, chances are it’s due for a wash. Keep in mind a brand new bed will smell like the factory and store it came from, so it’s a good idea to wash it before introducing it to your cat. If you’ve acquired a bed secondhand, be sure to wash it before letting your cat use it.
Beds with removable washable covers or that are entirely machine washable are excellent options.
 Once you’ve chosen a good location for the bed, place some of your cat’s toys in it. The toys will smell like your cat and help familiarize it with its bed.Leave the toys in the bed for least a day, but don’t pick your cat up and bring it to the bed. Give it time to figure out what the bed is for on its own.
 Giving your cat attention when you notice it using its bed will help it form a positive association with the bed. Offer lots of verbal praise, pet it, and offer it a small treat.Give your cat treats and praise only when you first see it get into its bed. Cats don’t like being disturbed while they sleep. Petting or praising your cat while it’s sleeping might make it dislike the bed.
 Do your best to make sure your cat doesn’t form a negative association with the bed. Switch up the bed’s location and make it more appealing instead of holding your cat in the bed, yelling at it, or otherwise forcing it to use the bed.If your cat associates the bed with being held down or yelled at, it won’t go anywhere near the bed.

Try a gentle, water-based cleanser such as Neutrogena, Cetaphil, and Eucerin. These are especially helpful if you have oily skin.
 Wet your face with lukewarm water and then pour a small amount of the cleanser into the palm of your hand. Massage the cleanser onto your face for about two minutes. Make sure to use small, gentle, circular motions.To help get rid of nose acne, pay special attention to your nose and all its curves. Get the cleanser into creases of your nose.
 Next, splash your face with lukewarm water or use a washcloth soaked in warm water to remove the cleanser from your face. Keep splashing your face with water or rinse the washcloth in warm water and repeat until you have wiped all the cleanser off your face.


Avoid scrubbing your skin. This can lead to irritation, redness, and breakouts.Use a cotton towel to pat dry your face after you have removed all of the cleanser.
 Apply a noncomedogenic moisturizer, such as products from Neutrogena, Cetaphil, and Olay. You can also try store brand moisturizers, but make sure you read the label to check that it is noncomedogenic.

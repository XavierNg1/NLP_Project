 The easiest way to shut down gossip is to not spread it. Tell your child to simply keep it to themselves, even if they believe the rumor is true.

Give them examples of what to say when they hear gossip. For example, they could say, “That’s none of my business” or “I’m sure there’s a perfectly good explanation for that.” Other kids may eventually stop coming to them with gossip if they don’t spread it., Your child may feel like they don’t have a choice about whether they hear gossip or not. Explain to them that they actually do. They have options other than sitting and listening to what the person says.

For example, they could say to the gossip-spreader, “I don’t want to talk about this. Let’s change the subject.” They could also simply walk away from the conversation if they feel it is heading in that direction., If your child finds friends who don’t gossip, chances are they won’t gossip either. Kids often feel closer to others when they share these juicy bits of information “in confidence.” However, these disclosures may end up floating around to many other kids.

Let your child know also that so-called friends who gossip to your child are also likely to spread gossip about them. People who create and spread rumors often can’t be trusted, which is another reason why making friends with those who don’t gossip is a good idea., If your child is aware of your no-gossiping policy and you still find out they have been doing it, you will need to enforce some consequences. Decide how to address the situation based on the severity of the gossip.

For example, if you learn your child has been spreading rumors about a teacher at school, you might forbid them from hanging with possible negative influences. You might also require that they write a letter of apology to the teacher.
If the situation is less severe, such as telling a sibling that two neighborhood kids are secretly dating, you might just tell them to stop.

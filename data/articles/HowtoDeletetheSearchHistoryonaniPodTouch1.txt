 Safari is the default browser on Apple products and this method will get rid of both your browsing history (the list of specific sites you have visited) and your search data (via google or other search engines, collected through the Safari browser).


Other browsers (Chrome, Firefox, et al.) also store browsing data - deleting this data typically requires navigating the settings menu within the browser app itself.;

On earlier versions (like iOS7) the appropriate button may read "Clear Cookies and Data" or something very similar and you may be asked again to confirm if you would like your history cleared.
If instead you want to save your browser history (of specific sites) but delete all other stored search information or website data, click into Settings>Safari>Advanced, then press Website Data>Remove All Website data.
If you'd like to delete only your Google search history, you will need to access google through your browser app, then click into google's "Settings" from there.
 Start typing in a web address that you know you've visited recently into your search bar. If you have successfully cleared your search history, Safari will not automatically fill in the rest of the address.

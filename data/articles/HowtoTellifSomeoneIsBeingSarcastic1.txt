 Many sarcastic remarks are completely over-the-top hyperbole, making them easy to identify. Typically a positive statement will be used when a negative response is expected, and vice versa.


An example of highly positive language would be: "That's the most gorgeous hat I've ever seen!" when the speaker really means, "No, I do not like that hat."
An example of highly negative language would be: "Well that's one way to really blow an exam!" as opposed to, "Congratulations on your top grade.";
, You can expect sarcastic remarks to contain words such as "love," "great," "best," "most," or "really." Also listen for unnatural pairings of adjectives with nouns, like "soft as a rock" or "sharp as a bowling ball." For example: "I just love the sweater grandma knit for me."
Translation: "I hate the sweater grandma knit for me."

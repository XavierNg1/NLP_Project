 Sketch a circle connected to a smaller one. Sketch in a guide for the facial features.
 Put another smaller set inside for each ear.
 The mouth should slant to the right of the face in such a way as to almost make your lion look like a bear.
 Make a small one for the neck and two large ones for the body.
 This will serve as a guide for the mane. A male lion's defining feature is its mane, as it makes it look bigger, so really emphasize that aspect!

, Draw a small circle for each foot with small ovals for the paws.
, Don't forget the mane!

, Erase any unnecessary guidelines.
 Use mostly gold and brown hues, unless your lion is of the imaginary sort.

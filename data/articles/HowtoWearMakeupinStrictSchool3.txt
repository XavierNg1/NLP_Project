 You're probably thinking it sounds weird, but it works! Line your eyes as you usually do with the eye-liner. Brown eye-shadow usually works best, and it isn't too noticeable. If you're really worried about teachers noticing the eye shadow, try smudging the shadow slightly or skip this step.
 You can buy them at any chemist or pharmacy. Another option is those ones which heat up, or, you can use a hair-dryer to slightly heat your eye curler. It is recommended to use some clear mascara after this, because it just brings out your eyes even more.
 Don't use eyebrow pencil unless you really have very very sparse eyebrows.

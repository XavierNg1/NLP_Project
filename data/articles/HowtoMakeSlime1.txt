 Be aware that this slime is poisonous if swallowed. Supervise children using the borax solution. Measure out one tablespoon (15 grams) borax powder and one cup (120 ml) warm water. Add these ingredients to a large mixing bowl. Stir the mixture until the borax is completely dissolved.;
, Add ½ cup (60 ml) of glue and ½ cup (60 ml) water to a separate mixing bowl. Stir the mixture until the two are well-combined. The consistency of the mixture should be watery.
 Choose any color food coloring you like! Green is classic, but feel free to experiment with any color. Start with a few drops of food coloring, then stir. If you want the color to be brighter, add a few more drops of the food coloring. If you add a lot, the color may end up pretty dark.









You can also separate the glue mixture evenly into smaller bowls and make each one a different color.
 Dump both mixtures into a large mixing bowl. Stir them together well. You will see the slime begin to form!









If you chose to make smaller amounts of slime in separate containers, evenly divide the borax solution among the containers.
 This will give the slime a chance to solidify and reach the ideal consistency.
 It is normal to have leftover water at the end of this process. Simply remove the slime from the water and discard the water.

 The bed should be the focal point of your room.Being thoughtful about where you place it can make the room feel larger or smaller.


If you have a double bed, place it in the center of the room's most visible wall, with space on either side to get out. This leaves the most free space along the walls. If you have a dresser, place it on the wall opposite the foot of the bed.If you have a twin bed, put it in a corner. The head and one side of the bed should be along perpendicular walls. This maximizes the remaining floor space in the center of the room., Chances are, your bed takes up more floor space than any other item in the room. Don't let this space go to waste! Store as much as you can under the bed.


Consider some risers. For a small amount, you can buy risers that go under each leg of your bed. They raise it further off the floor, allowing you to store larger items underneath.Some tubs, bins, or baskets can help you make the most of the space under the bed, keeping your possessions organized.
You can also install drawers under your bed. You can use the drawers of an old dresser, or you can buy a bed with drawers already installed. This can be a great place to store clothes, shoes, or small knickknacks.
Alternatively, if you don't need to store anything under your bed, it can be a good idea to choose one that is low to the ground. This creates a smaller appearance and can make the room look more spacious.
 If you are in a position to consider buying a new bed, another option is to get a loft or murphy bed.A loft bed is a like a bunk bed without the bottom bunk. This allows you to use the space under the bed for another large piece of furniture, like a desk or dresser.
A Murphy bed is a bed that folds up off the floor, sometimes right into the wall. You won't be able to store things in the area the bed folds down into, but you can fold the bed up when not in use to create more floor space.

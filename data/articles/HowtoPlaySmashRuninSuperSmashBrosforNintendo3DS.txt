, Customization items come in three options: equipment, specials, and powers. You can do this by selecting "Custom" at the Smash Run screen and selecting the character you want to customize.
 You can do this by selecting "Music" at the Smash Run screen and check marking the music tracks you want on the bottom screen.
 Which one you should choose depends on whether you're playing by yourself or with other people.
 Press the Start button on the 3DS when you're done.
 Power-ups will be spread around the course, along with being released from enemies and from treasure chests. The more power-ups you get, the stronger your character will be.


Power-ups come in six categories: speed (makes you faster), jump (allows you to jump higher), attack (powers up your physical attacks), special (powers up your special attacks), arms (powers up projectiles, item attacks, healing effects of items, and throws), and defense (gives you more resistance to knockback).
Going through the doors seen throughout the course will lead you to a bonus area; the objective of which varies by area. Successfully completing the objective will get you more power-ups.
 It may be a normal match, a match with a modifier (such as being giant or starting with a high percentage), a horizontal or vertical race, or a match where you have to defeat as many enemies as you can in one minute on a normal stage.


Use the power-ups you accumulated to your advantage to win against your opponents. After the match, you get any trophies and character customization items you collected during the 5 minutes.

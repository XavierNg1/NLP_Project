 Place the water in a saucepan and put it on a burner. Turn the burner to medium high and heat the water until it starts steaming.
 Use a fully developed brown coconut instead of a young green one. Open the coconut, scoop out the meat and grate it into a bowl.
 Put the grated coconut in a blender. Pour the hot water over the coconut and close the lid of the blender. Hold the lid of the blender in place and puree the coconut and water into a smooth mixture.


Don't fill the blender more than halfway full with hot water. If your blender is on the smaller side, blend the coconut and water in two batches. Filling the blender too high may cause the lid to fly off.
Hold the lid in place while you're blending the mixture; otherwise it could come off while you're blending.
 Place cheesecloth or a fine-mesh strainer over a bowl. Pour the pureed coconut over the cloth or strainer so that the coconut milk drips into the bowl. Use a spatula to push the pulp and squeeze out as much liquid as possible.


If it's easier for you, you could pick up the cheesecloth and squeeze it over the bowl with your hands.
To extract even more liquid, pour more hot water over the pulp and squeeze it again.
 Place it in a saucepan on a burner and turn the heat to medium high. Bring it to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until the water has evaporated and the cream has separated from the oil and turned brown.


The process of boiling the liquid until it reaches the right state could take over an hour. Be patient, and stir constantly.If you'd rather not boil the mixture, you can allow it to separate on its own. Place the liquid in a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Leave it at room temperature for 24 hours, then place it in the refrigerator so the oil solidifies and floats to the top. Strain the oil from the liquid.

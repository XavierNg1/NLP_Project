 This is the classic "stoner" gaze. Smoking causes the veins in your eyes to expand, which makes them much more visible. This causes the well-known red eye in stoners.


You can also rub some freshly cut onion or peppermint extract under your eyes to get the tears flowing, which causes red eye.
Try not to blink. It isn't fun, but it will create red eye.;
, Your eyelids and lips will fall lightly to the floor, as if half asleep. Let yourself sink into the chair, or slump slightly whenever you're standing. You want to be totally relaxed.


If you find yourself staring for a long time into nothing, body barely moving, then you're crushing it.
 You're not in a hurry, man. Keep the hustle to a minimum, really only moving when it is most necessary. High-guys & gals rarely feel compelled to do things that aren't strictly necessary, and neither should you. When you do move, take your time.


Try to flow through your movements, like the pictures of grooving hippies used in cartoons and old videos., Imagine that your throat and mouth are bone dry, as many people who smoke regularly can attest. Drop your voice into a low, bass-y register and scratch out the words a bit.
 A bag of chips or a box of Oreos is the perfect prop for the high-guy. Aim for regular, unceasing eating, which is why bagged chips and pretzels are often your best bet. The "munchies" generally aim for salty or sweet foods, and some stoners find them uncontrollable. Well-placed, constant eating will help sell the part well.

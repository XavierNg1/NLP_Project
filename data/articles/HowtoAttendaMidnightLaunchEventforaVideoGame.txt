 Not all stores hold a midnight launch event. Look up the store's phone number and call it to see if the store is holding one.;
,, Games will sometimes be delayed, so be sure that you keep up on its release date.
 On the day before the game is released, go to the store at 10:00 PM at the latest. You may want to head there earlier depending on the popularity of the game, how popular the store is, and how large your town/city is.
 Talk to the people around you, as they're also looking to get the game. You could also play games on a handheld video game console if you brought one, play board games if you have some with you, or read a book.
 Don't stay up too late playing it when you get home, though!

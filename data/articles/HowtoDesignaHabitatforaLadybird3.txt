 Look for raw bamboo at gardening supply stores or the outdoor section of hardware stores. You can also find them online or in Walmart's home and garden center. Look for stalks at least a foot in length, and ½ to 2 inches in diameter.
 Using a small hand saw, to shorten your bamboo stalks to about 10 – 12 inches in length. Cut the ends at an angle, so that the “top” side of the tube is longer than the “bottom” side of the tube on both ends. This will create a small “canopy” over the entrance to the tube to help keep rain out.Be careful not to split the bamboo when you cut it.
Use sandpaper to smooth any rough edges.
 Using a small power drill, create a hole near the opening at each end. Drill both holes on the “top,” or longer side of the tube.Be sure the holes are large enough to feed the chain or twine through.
 You can use sturdy twine or slender chain to hang your ladybird feeder. Thread the twine into one hole from the outside, push it through the tube, and pull it out through the hole at the other end. Pull the twine until the overhanging ends are about the same length, and tie the ends together. If you are using chain, connect the ends with a twisty tie., Place a handful of raisins in the feeder tube before hanging it. The raisins will attract ladybirds, and give them something to eat when pest insects are scarce.Replenish your feeder with raisins from time to time, to keep your ladybirds around when they aren't eating aphids.
 Hang the feeder close to the plants in your garden that seem to attract the most pests. Rose bushes, in particular, are known to attract aphids (a favorite of ladybugs.), Ladybirds will help keep your plants healthy by feeding on scales, mites, mealybugs, leaf hoppers, and aphids. To attract more ladybugs to your garden, plant things that will attract them.Flowers that attract ladybirds include: geraniums (scented), coreopsis, and cosmos.
Herbs that attract ladybugs include: angelica, cilantro, caraway, fennel, and dill.

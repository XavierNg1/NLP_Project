 For suddenly missing toolbars in Chrome, try looking under the "View" menu located 4th from the left along the uppermost menu bar on your screen (after "Chrome", "File", and "Edit"). A checkmark next to "Always Show Bookmarks Bar" means that the Bookmarks Bar is currently visible.


For the bookmark tool bar specifically, try keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F11 (for PCs) or ⌘ Cmd+⇧ Shift+B (for Macs).
 One reason you may find your Chrome navigation bar hidden is that you've inadvertently lapsed into full screen mode. To toggle this mode on and off use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+⇧ Shift+F (for PCs) or ⌘ Cmd+⇧ Shift+F (for Macs).
 Too many Chrome extensions installed and visible in your tool bar area may be hiding your navigation bar from view and in some cases these extensions may even be hiding the bar programmatically. Look through and manage (i.e. delete or disable) your extensions by accessing the upper right corner settings menu, then clicking "More Tools", then "Extensions".

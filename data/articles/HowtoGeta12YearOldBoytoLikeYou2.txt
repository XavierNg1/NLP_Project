 Ask him questions about his family, hobbies, school, movies, books, or sports and you will very likely find some things that you have in common with him. Start talking about one of these things to strike up another conversation, and even ask to hang out in order to watch a TV show, play a sport, or just talk about something you’re both into. If you both like basketball, for example, you could say, “Hey, I have a basketball hoop in my driveway, we should play sometime!”

, Let him know that you’re smart by telling him fun facts, helping him while you do homework together, or just sharing something else you know a lot about. Never downplay your intelligence or “play dumb” to get his attention.
 Tell him true things about yourself and answer his questions honestly as you’re getting to know him. Avoid the temptation to tell small white lies or say you like something just because he likes it. The truth will only come out later and it could make him less interested when he finds out you were making something up.


If he says “I really like country music,” you don’t have to say you like it too if you don’t, but you can still keep the conversation going. You could say “That’s cool. I’m more of a rock music person, but I can get into anything! What country artists do you like?”

, Pay close attention when he talks to you and remember things he says that you can bring up in later conversations. Listen well and give him your full attention to show him you really care what he has to say.
 If you’ve already spent some time with him, go ahead and tell him that you like him! You can say, “Hey, I think you’re really cute and funny. Do you want to go out sometime?” or “I like you more than just a friend. I’d love to go on a date with you!”

, Make jokes, lightly tease him about something (without being mean!), or even offer to arm wrestle as a way to hold his hand and either impress him by winning or make him feel good if he wins.

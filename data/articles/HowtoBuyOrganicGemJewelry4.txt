 Jet is a form of coal made from fossilized wood. It was popular in the nineteenth century but is rarely seen today. Finding jet at a major retail jeweler will be difficult, and you may struggle to find it at a smaller jeweler, as well. Shopping online is your best option for new jet. Given its popularity in the past, however, you can also find it in antique jewelry sold at antique malls and vintage shops.
 Good jet has been polished until it gives off a matte or mildly glossy luster reminiscent of wax or velvet. It should not appear too shimmery, but it should not look too dull, either. If buying an antique piece, the polished luster may have worn off. Ask the merchant to quickly polish the gemstone to determine if the jet is real and able to be polished to its original condition.
 This gemstone has a very low density, so it is easy to wear even in large amounts.
 Jet has a low hardness and is easily scratched. A piece of jet jewelry that has been properly cared for should have minimal scratches, but do not be too surprised if you see a few light scratches on antique pieces.

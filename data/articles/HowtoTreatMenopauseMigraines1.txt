 When you feel a migraine coming on, try to treat it before it gets too severe. Immediately reduce the light and sound in the room. Sit or lie down in a dark, quiet room. Try to take a nap if itâ€™s possible.Make sure to limit your nap to 20 or 30 minutes. Sleeping longer than that could disrupt your normal sleeping patterns, which may worsen migraines.;
, To help alleviate the pain, try using a cold pack or a heating pad. The cold can help numb pain, while heat can relax muscles.Place an ice pack, or a package of frozen vegetables, on your forehead, your temples, or the back of your neck.You may also want to try a heated bath or shower.
 A light massage may help lessen a migraine. Try rubbing your temples, or the area that hurts, with light pressure in a circular motion. Apply pressure for up to 15 seconds, and repeat as necessary.Rub your neck and back, or ask someone else to rub them. This can help release tension and alleviate your headache.
 Caffeine may help reduce migraine pain. If you feel the beginnings of a migraine, drink a beverage with a moderate amount of caffeine. Try a soda, cup of coffee, or a cup of tea.This should only be used two to three days a week to help migraines. More than that could result in a caffeine dependency, which may make migraines worse.Be aware that caffeine may trigger migraines in some individuals.
There are some over the counter medicines, such as Excedrin Migraine, that contain some caffeine along with pain relievers.Taking one of these medicines may also help to relieve a migraine.

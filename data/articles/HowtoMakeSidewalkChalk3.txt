 Fill each well or bottle halfway with cornstarch. If you see any clumps, break them up with a fork or by shaking the bottle.


A muffin tin will act like a paint palette. You will need a paintbrush to use the paint. It is great for painting pictures.
A squeeze bottle will allow you to squirt the paint out onto the sidewalk. It is great if you want to create random designs.
 The more food coloring you use, the brighter or darker your chalk will be. You can fill each well or bottle with the same color. You can also fill each well or bottle with a different color.


To make scented liquid sidewalk chalk: mix 1 envelope of a powdered fruit drink with 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water.You will be adding this mixture to the cornstarch in the next step. Skip the food coloring, as the fruit juice will be enough to give the chalk some color.
 If you are making the scented version, pour your drink mixture into each well or bottle.


Try to use equal parts water and cornstarch.
For a thicker paint, use one part water to one-and-a-half parts cornstarch., If you are making the liquid sidewalk chalk in a muffin tin, use a fork. If you are making the liquid sidewalk chalk in a squeeze bottle, close the bottle tightly and shake it. Make sure that there are no clumps. The color should be even once you are done mixing.
 A thicker paint will be easier to paint with, but a thinner paint will be easier to squirt out of a squeeze bottle. If the paint is too thin, add more cornstarch. If the paint is too thick, add more water. Be sure to mix your paint well once you add the extra cornstarch or water.
 Dip a paintbrush into the muffin tin wells, and paint pictures on your sidewalk. If you are using a squeeze bottle, hold it horizontally over the sidewalk and give it a quick squeeze.

 Walk up behind her and kiss her neck. Touch her stomach and breasts. Run your hands over her body and make her feel your desire.Press yourself against her back and grind, slowly.
 Dim the lights, turn off your phone, and try to be absolutely present in this intimate space. Run your hands over her body. Kiss her: gently, at first, then more passionately as the mood heats up. Slowly, carefully undress her, and let her clothes fall to the floor. Look deep into her eyes, and smile.


Give her a massage. Practice your foot or back massage so that you can truly help her relax. Warm up her muscles while giving her some loving attention.
Run your fingers or lips across her joints. The neck, inside elbows, and the back of the knee are more sensitive than other parts of the body.
Touch her thighs. Work your way slowly up and down her legs. Grab her rear and dig your fingers into her hip., Whisper your compliments or come-ons slowly and seductively into her ear. Tell her how much you want her. The gentle brush of your lips combined with a low voice can help turn her on.
 Invest in bedroom toys that are geared toward women. Give her the toy as a gift, and suggest that the two of you try it out later., Some people like to be more dominant in the bedroom, while others prefer a more submissive role.Pick up on cues regarding whether or not she likes to be in control. Bear in mind that she may like to take charge sometimes, but also quite enjoy it when you make the moves. If she always waits for you to start the move to the bedroom, then she might like it when you are slightly dominant.


Don't be afraid to ask her. If you're comfortable doing so, you can simply say, "Do you find that you're more dominant or more submissive in bed?" You might also phrase it as a statement: "I love the feeling of taking charge in the bedroom. How do you like it when I do that?"

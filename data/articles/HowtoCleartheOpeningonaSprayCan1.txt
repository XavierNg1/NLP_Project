 Before you go to extreme lengths to unclog your spray paint nozzle, try removing the built up paint with warm water. Dampen a fresh rag with clean, warm water. Wipe the nozzle’s opening with the damp rag. Test the spray paint on a piece of scrap material.While you may scrape out the loosened paint with a needle or toothpick, please note that this is not universally recommended. Inserting a sharp object in the nozzle may damage the spray system.You may remove the nozzle or leave it attached to the bottle.;
, If the warm water didn’t wash away the paint, you can wipe the opening of the nozzle with paint thinner. Dip a clean rag into the paint thinner. Wipe the nozzle with the rag. Test the spray paint on a piece of extra material.Before you handle the paint thinner, put on a pair of protective gloves.
You may remove the nozzle before cleaning it with paint thinner.
 After using spray paint, always clear the nozzle of excess paint before you store it. To clear the nozzle:


Turn the bottle upside down.
Press down on the nozzle until a clear mist comes out.

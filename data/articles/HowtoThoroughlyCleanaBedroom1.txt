, This includes the things on your bed, things under your bed, things from the wardrobe and everything in storage in your room. Make 5 separate piles: keep, throw away, storage, give away, and not sure. Sort out everything into these piles.
 Also, empty the trash can.
 Make sure nothing in this pile is broken, and check to see if there's anything someone you know could have, then put all these items into the bag. Take it to a charity later.
 Think whether you really need to keep them. If they have no functional use and you don't really want them on show, yet are of sentimental value then put it in the 'storage' pile. A good way to test whether you really need something is checking if the last time you used or looked at something was in the past few months. If it wasn't, then you probably don't need it.
 Hopefully the room is starting to look tidier now you've sorted things out. The storage things go.. you guessed it, into storage. This could be a basement, garage, attic, or storage boxes in your room. Put all these things away.
 Dust, wipe, and wash all surfaces in your room, including doors, light switches and windows. Vacuum your room, and take any cups or plates out of your room. Don't skip the hard to reach / under the bed / in the corner spots. Move small pieces of furniture so you can reach everywhere. Then clean each "keep" item thoroughly, either in bucket filled with hot water and dish soap or with rags and plenty of disinfecting cleaner.
 Your room should now be fully clean and tidy.

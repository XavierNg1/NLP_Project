 This is how much time your cocktail needs to cook over high heat. You can prepare the cocktail earlier than that, of course, but you'll need to cook it over low heat., Consider tying the cloves up in a piece of cheesecloth first. You can also put them into a tea ball or tea strainer instead. This will keep the cloves together, and your guests won't have to go through the effort of plucking them out of their drinks.For those living in the United Kingdom and Europe, this recipe calls for non-alcoholic apple cider, or unfiltered, unsweetened apple cider. Do not use regular "hard" cider.
 What temperature you cook the cocktail on depends on when you plan on serving it. If you plan on serving the cocktail within 2 to 3 hours, cook the cocktail on high. If you plan on serving the cocktail later than that, cook it on low., A few minutes before serving time, fill your mugs with hot, boiling water. Let the water sit in the mugs for 1 to 2 minutes, then pour it out. Dry the mugs off with a clean towel, then line them up. The hot mugs will keep the cider warm and fragrant. If you use cold mugs, the cider will cool off too quickly., Take care to avoid the cinnamon sticks and cheesecloth pouch (or tea ball/tea strainer). You can include a few cranberries in each mug for presentation, if you'd like., You will need 1 ounce (30 milliliters) of rum for each mug.You can also make virgin or non-alcoholic versions be leaving the rum out.

If this is for a party, consider serving the spiked cider and virgin cider in different colored mugs. This will allow your guests to tell them apart.

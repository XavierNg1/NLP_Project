 It takes time to establish relationships with people. If possible, start reaching out to people about your project years in advance. By sending occasional emails to reviewers and potential buyers you’ve connected with, you can build connections that will make the promotion process much smoother when your book is finished. While it’s a slower process, trying to sell to one already interested person at a time is much more effective than try to sell to faceless thousands., Write down a list of clear goals that you’d like to accomplish, pick dates to accomplish them by, and brainstorm ways that you can make them happen.


As you’re nearing the end of the writing process, you might set a goal to finish the book and have it ready for editing in three weeks. You can reach this deadline by estimating how many hours of writing it will require each day, and committing to putting the work in.
Later in the process, you may set a goal to sell fifty more books within the next month. In order to make this happen, you can commit to reading a book on how to improve your salesmanship skills and put what you learn into practice., Getting your book recognized on a large scale is possible, but it will take a lot of time and consistency. Instead of putting all of your effort into promoting the book you just finished, spend some time starting your new one. Continue doing what you do best to work towards becoming an established author with a growing platform.

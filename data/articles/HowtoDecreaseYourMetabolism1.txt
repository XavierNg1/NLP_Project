 You can find an online calculator, or you can use the following formulas, depending on your gender:


Women: BMR = 655 + (4.35 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years)Men: BMR = 66 + (6.23 x weight in pounds) + (12.7 x height in inches) - (6.8 x age in year);
, Once you have calculated your BMR, you can estimate your total calorie needs for different levels of activity. Decreasing your metabolism means you are "turning down" your body's internal furnaces, which lowers your calorie requirements. Use your BMR to make the following calculations. If you:


Are inactive or exercise rarely: Calories to stay the same weight = BMR x 1.2Exercise lightly 1 to 3 days per week: Calories to stay the same weight = BMR x 1.375Exercise moderately for 3 to 5 days per week: Calories to stay the same weight = BMR x 1.55Exercise actively for 6 to 7 days per week: Calories to stay the same weight = BMR x 1.725Exercise intensely every day: Calories to stay the same weight = BMR x 1.9

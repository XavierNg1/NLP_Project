 You will be more likely to remember things when the situation leads to strong emotions. Think about when you were most happy. Emotional arousal is more likely to help in retaining the memory rather than importance of the information.Take time each day to reflect on your positive memories from the past. They can be a source of affirmation and motivation, so that you will avoid forgetting.
 If you are concerned about forgetting significant past events, consider talking about them with your friends and family on a more routine basis. Reminiscing about the past can help to strengthen our relationships in the present.


Consider ways that you can share memories with people of different generations. Talk with your older relatives. Compare your life experiences to the experiences of your parents, grandparents, or older adults., Significant milestones, family gatherings, and vacations can all be memories that you cherish. To avoid forgetting these events, there are many ways to create keepsakes that act as a reminder. Consider these things to keep the memories alive:


Photo albums and framed pictures
Memory or keepsake boxes
Handicrafts such as quilts that use symbols for significant events
Video or film of the events
Souvenirs

, By writing down your thoughts at the time of the events, you are recording the present moment as it unfolds. Personal diaries can help to keep memories alive. You may look back at your writings years later and be able to reflect on any changes.


Journals are often the most personal way of recording your memories. They can give context and details in ways that a photograph cannot.

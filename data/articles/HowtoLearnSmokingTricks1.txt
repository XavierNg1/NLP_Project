 Windy days will make it impossible for even the best smoke tricksters to conjure up a trick. You want as little outside wind as possible, so stay away from fans, close the windows, and choose a still, quiet room., The smoke will start to dissipate in your lungs, making it thinner and weaker. Take short breaths in, puffing your cheeks out slightly, and work on keeping the smoke in your mouth. Think of taking 3-4 partial inhales instead of one big, long drag on your hookah or cigarette.You should feel the smoke towards your throat, especially if you take several quick breaths.
 A long, slow exhalation keeps the smoke packed together, helping it appear as a thicker, more coherent cloud. Work on exhaling in a controlled, stream, almost letting the smoke eek out of you instead of forcing it., Rolled smoking devices, like joints, cigarettes, and blunts have thick smoke because the paper is burning along with the contents. E-pens, with their high vapor content, are also good to smoke for tricks. But the easiest way to do tricks is with a hookah because the glycerin in shisha is vital to thick plumes of smoke.Water bongs and pipes are usually the hardest to use for smoke tricks.
 This simple trick is just a good way to practice keeping the smoke in your mouth, not your lungs. To do it, simply take a big puff, then close your mouth. Open your mouth with a quick, percussive "puh!" sound to push a big ball of smoke out of your lips. It should clear your mouth completely. If the cloud is a big, solid white color you're doing well.
 This simple trick is a good way to practice using your nose and mouth together. It ends up shooting 4 small streams of smoke: 2 from your lips and two from your nose. To do it:


Take a big inhalation of smoke, keeping it in your mouth if possible.
Extend your bottom lip to the sides, pushing your top lip down in the center, so their are two openings on the corners of your mouth.
Breathe out of your nose and lips at the same time.

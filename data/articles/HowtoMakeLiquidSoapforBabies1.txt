 Castile soap is made from olive oil and traditionally comes from Castile, Spain. You may choose to buy extra-thick soap because it results in a better lather.


You can choose to buy Castile soap in any amount from a pint to a gallon, depending upon how much soap you want to make.
When purchasing your Castile soap off the Internet, the main ingredient will be olive oil; however, you can choose to thicken it with additional oils, such as coconut, jojoba, almond or hemp oil. You may want to test these oils on your baby's skin before ordering.;
, Do not buy fragrance oil. Instead, ensure your lavender, citrus or other oil is 100 percent essential oil.
 This acts as a natural preservative, so that your batch of soap will not have a short shelf life.
 It is a good idea to order 1 lb. of flowers from an organic online supplier.

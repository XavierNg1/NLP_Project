 One method of tenderizing meat mechanically is by pounding. You can use a meat hammer but lacking that, a solid glass bottle or a drinking glass can be used as well. Use the end of the hammer with the points or the edge of the bottle or glass to pound the meat. Like slicing thinly, the pounding breaks up the collagen fibers and tenderized the meat.
 Devices can be purchased that involve the use of small blades or knives that can be applied to meat for tenderization. Some are hand held and some use a rolling mechanism to pass the meat through the processor. Once the meat has been tenderized mechanically, it can also be marinated if you like.
 Pan frying or deep frying works well because the meat cooks quickly at a high temperature.

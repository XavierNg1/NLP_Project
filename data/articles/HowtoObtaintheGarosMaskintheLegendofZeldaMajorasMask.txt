 You can do this after getting the Powder Keg and blowing up the boulder in Milk Road with it.;
, Go through the gate and call Epona.


To reach the racetrack on Milk Road, go south of the Clock Tower, and continue walking in a straight line through the hollow log. At the end of the log, turn right and you'll see a sign that reads "Milk Road".
 He will soon challenge you if you have Epona in that same area.
 This mask is used for when you head to Ikana Canyon later in the game.

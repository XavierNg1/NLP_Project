 You can design and print a label using adhesive paper, or you can make a label from scratch using a piece of paper and clear tape. Make the label after you have poured the Mod Podge into the container and shaken it up. Here is how you can make a label from scratch, without a computer or printer:Write "Mod Podge" or "Decoupage" on a small piece of paper.
Cut a piece of clear, packaging tape that is bigger than your label.
Place the label face down onto the middle of the piece of tape.
Wrap the packing tape around the glass container. Smooth the tape down to rid the label of any air bubbles.
 Simply apply a thin layer of Mod Podge to the area you want decorated using a paint brush. You can also use a foam brush as well. Press your fabric or paper onto the wet Mod Podge, making sure to smooth out any ripples, bubbles or creases. Apply a second, thin layer of Mod Podge on top of your fabric or paper. You can always apply another coat of Mod Podge after the first one has dried., If you made Mod Podge out of glue and water, you can add a few drops of food coloring, and then paint it over some mason jars. This will create colored mason jars. Be sure to add 2 tablespoons of water-based gloss or varnish to your Mod Podge, or else the jars will be matte and frosted-looking.


If you wish to create tinted mason jars that look like sea glass, then omit the varnish.
 Your homemade Mod Podge will not be as durable as the store-bought variety. You can make it more durable by wait until it has dried completely (several hours) and then applying spray-on acrylic sealer.


Simply hold the can six to eight inches away from the surface and spray the paint on using light, even strokes. Once the sealer has dried, you may add a second coat, if necessary.
If you added varnish or glitter to your Mod Podge to make it glossy, be sure that you use an acrylic sealer with a gloss finish.

 Open up about your financial stress to those you trust. They have wisdom about what next steps to take. Finding support can be key when you're feeling overwhelmed.Talk with friends, family, or relatives who appear to have made sound financial decisions. Ask what they might recommend to make your situation more manageable.
Avoid using this as an opportunity to ask them for money. Getting your friends or family involved in your money woes will likely lead to tension or drama.
 Find support to help refinance your loans, consolidate your payments, or reduce your debts. Use only trusted, certified credit counselors. Research the options available to you first, in order to avoid scams.

, Money problems can be a major cause of stress in a relationship. Think about how your financial decisions, or your partner's, have negatively impacted the relationship. If you're continuing to fight about spending habits and feel like you've reached a stale-mate, consider talking with a therapist or couples' counselor.A couples' counselor can help to teach open lines of communication. They may help you to reframe how to handle your behaviors and your relationship in a clearer way.
Oftentimes the causes of financial stress don't stem from the money itself, but from the actions that lead to the debt, or possibly reckless spending habits. Therapists may help you to take control of those behaviors and find healthier ways to cope when feeling stressed.

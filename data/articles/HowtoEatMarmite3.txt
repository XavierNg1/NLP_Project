 If you've recently gained an appreciation for Marmite and you're looking to expand your repertoire, try this Marmite-centered sampler dish, which works as a hearty meal on its own and scales easily for larger groups. Start by boiling a few eggs in a pot of water until they're hard boiled. Depending on the size of the eggs, this should take about eight to ten minutes.


Run cold water over the eggs after they're done cooking. Cooling them down halts the cooking process and prevents them from overcooking., Next, let's get our vegetables ready for the Marmite. Wash a bell pepper, a handful of cherry tomatoes, a cucumber, a carrot, and a few clumps of broccoli under running water. Cut each into small bite-size pieces. Any shapes that look appealing are fine, but, for efficiency's sake, you'll probably want to julienne your bell pepper (cut it into skinny strips) and take thin circular slices from your cucumber.
 Finally, make a few golden-brown slices of Marmite's most well-known companion dish. You can use white, wheat, or even specialty breads like sourdough and rye here — it's up to you! When the toast is ready, butter it. As noted above, butter and Marmite pair quite well together.
 Arrange your vegetables, eggs, and toast in a circle around the outside of a large plate. Open a jar of Marmite and place it in the center of the dish.


Don't forget to peel your hard-boiled eggs. If you'd like to use them to hold Marmite like crackers, cut the eggs into quarters or eights to make skinny, curved slices.
 Using a butter knife, put small portions of Marmite on each piece of vegetable or egg before biting in. You can eat the toast without Marmite as a "chaser" to ready your mouth for the next bit piece of Marmite, or, if you're bold, just spread a tiny dollop of Marmite on each piece of bread.


If you want to, you can even dip your foods directly into the jar of Marmite. Be careful — it's easy to get more Marmite than you intended this way!

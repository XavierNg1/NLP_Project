 Once you’ve written your cards, you can organize them one of two ways. The easiest way is to alphabetize them by the authors’ last names, as that is how you will be organizing your reference page. Just put them in order in a box (or use a rubber band to keep them together), adding sticky notes where you change letters.
 The second way to organize is by the numbers in the right-hand corner, if you’re using that system. You can add sticky notes every tenth number to make it easier to look up information.

 Many third-party websites list foreclosure properties. These websites may be for-profit resources.


Note how often the website is updated. If not updated daily, the newest foreclosure properties may not be listed.
 Serious investors may also want to network with other investors online about foreclosure opportunities. Networking can be one of the best routes to finding the most lucrative foreclosures.

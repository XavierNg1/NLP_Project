 Letting them know what you're trying to do might save you some embarrassment, as your friend now understands that whatever you do then on, you're only trying to help.;
, Always give your friend a mental psych-up. Reassure them constantly that they're 'okay'. Most cases of shyness stems from less appreciation of a subject's personality. Lovingly offer advice on the few things you feel need to be changed, while convincing your friend that they're 'wonderful', 'fun-to-be-with', and very 'attractive'. It would go a long way to boosting such a person's confidence.
 Create an image of someone they can talk to at any time and about anything without a sense of shame being felt.
 Remember that shyness isn't a trait we choose. Simply because you're one bubbly, full-of-life individual does not follow that your friend should 'naturally' toe the same line. Do not tease him/her or call them names like 'snail', or 'hermit', or the likes.
 Plan functions where you two can go together and slowly ease them into society. Always be by your friend's side, to boost his/her morale, especially if you're a well-known or popular person (even if this would bring all the major attention your way). Bring him/her into conversations slowly and introduce them nicely to new people. Start with small occasions within your friend's comfort zone (like your classroom projects, street carnivals, church gatherings, etc.), and work to broaden that perspective.
, Help them frame display these pictures in their room, post them on social media profiles (if such a person permits, but don't over push this option), or start a picture album.

 Before you can work on your own gate opening ability, you need to ensure that your horse will not be spooked by a gate swinging wide in front of him. To get your horse used to the scary movement of the gate, dismount and try swinging the gate gently in front of him while firmly holding him, ensuring he is calm and comfortable.

Continue to get him comfortable with the sound, the feel of the gate, the speed of the gate and so on. If he initially spooks and throws his head back or clearly looks scared, ease in more gently with reassuring pats on his neck and shoulders.;
, Before even trying to open a gate on horseback, you need to have nimble fingers and sensible methods to opening the gate. Try without your horse completely, continuously unlatching and re-fastening the gate as quickly and sensibly as you can. Be spatially aware when doing this and imagine if you were on a horse - you would stretch your arm out as far as you could and push the gate slowly to walk through it.

Try recreating this on foot; undo the gate and push it gently but firmly, leaving enough space for you and your horse. Then, re-fasten the gate and practise until you have it!

, When you approach the gate with the now desensitized horse and your clever hands, position your horse so that you can conveniently open the gate without having to stretch too much, putting you at risk of falling. At the same time you need to make sure no part of the horse's body is obstructing the pathway of the gate.

Once ensured you are in a safe place, undo the latch on the gate and push it slowly past your horse's face, and proceed to firmly swing it backwards.
 Turn him slowly around, just before the gate closes naturally. Make sure not to turn to quickly as your horse may go through the gate again or spook at the fast movement of it., Turn around and proceed with your hack!

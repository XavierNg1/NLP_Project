 In a large pitcher that holds approximately 2 quarts (1.9 l), place 1 orange that’s been sliced, 1 lemon that’s been sliced, 1 lime that’s been sliced, and half a grapefruit that’s been sliced. After the fruit, add 1 cup of fresh mint leaves.You can use any combination of fruit that you prefer for your water. You may even want to keep things simple and use only one type of fruit, such as lemon slices.
You can customize the water by choosing other fruits to substitute in or add to the recipe. Strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, apples, peaches, kiwi, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, and watermelon are other options to consider. Experiment with different combination to find your favorite.
 When the fruit and mint is in the pitcher, pour 6 cups (1.4 l) of water over them. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon, and then add enough ice to fill the pitcher.Use bottled or filtered water in the spa water.
In addition to the fresh fruit, you can add frozen berries to the mixture in place of ice cubes to help chill it.
 Once all of the ingredients are in the pitcher, place it in the refrigerator. Allow the water to chill for approximately two hours so the fruit and mint flavors have time to infuse the water. Pour it into glasses to serve.If you prefer, you can serve the water at room temperature. However, you should still let it sit for a couple of hours so the fruit has time to flavor the water.

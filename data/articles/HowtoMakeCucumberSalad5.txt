 Pour the vinegar into a small bowl. Add the sugar, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, and salt. Mix them together with a fork or mini whisk, then set the bowl aside. This will give the flavors time to blend while you prepare the rest of the salad.
 Try to slice the cucumbers as thinly as you can. If they have large seeds in them, you will need to core them first. Place the cucumbers into a large serving bowl when you are done.
 If you can't find any chopped peanuts in the store, you can shell and chop regular peanuts using a sharp knife. You can also pulse them for a few seconds in a food processor instead.
 Pour the dressing over the salad, then toss the salad using a pair of salad tongs. Be sure to grab the salad from the bottom of the bowl so that everything gets evenly coated with dressing.


If the dressing settle or separated, give it a brisk stir first.
 If you can't serve to right away, cover it with a sheet of plastic wrap and store it in the fridge. You will need to toss it once more just before serving.

 Chopsticks can be made of many types of wood (such as aspen, chestnut, pine, cedar, cherry, sandalwood, and paulownia). The wood used needs to be hard and resistant to water., Slice the wood with an axe so that the grains are straight. Cut your wood to a 1.5”x.5”x11” block. Roughly shape the block of wood with a 14” plane (a hand tool for shaping wood) and then slice it in half with an axe.Each stock should be slightly larger than a quarter inch thick., Use a 9” plane to set the chamfer, a symmetrical sloping edge. Do this to one end of each chopstick. Finish shaping the chopsticks with a 6” smoothing plane. This will get rid of any rough wood and make the chopsticks smooth. Round the tips with the smoothing plane., Typically, chopsticks are around 10 inches long, but you can cut them to the length that you are comfortable with. Slightly chamfer the ends to finish the chopsticks.

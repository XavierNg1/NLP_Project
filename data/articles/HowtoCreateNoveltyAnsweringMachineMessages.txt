, If you want music, put the earphone up to the microphone holes. Or if you play the piano, or another instrument that doesn't require your mouth, play as your saying "*insert name*'s phone, leave a message" or likewise. Make sure that the music isn't up too loud, otherwise whoever is calling you won't be able to understand or hear a word your saying.
 and wait a couple seconds. Then say something along the lines of "Oh, hey!" or just say "Sorry, I'm not home right now, please leave a message. Note:Some people will get mad if you do this.
 If you like The Simpsons, you could consider saying "Thank you, come again!" or anything close. If you are a fan of The Office, you could try to sing the song "Ryan started the fire". Or you could record that right off the TV if the machine is close to the TV.

 You could have a fan going into the phone and slightly yell "Sorry! I.... can't make it to the... ahhh! Phone! Oh crap! that's the TV! Leave..... a message...... after... Oh no! *insert friends or boy/girlfriends name*!" Or likewise. Hang up the phone in a loud way, to make it sound like you were blown away. Make sure that if you have the fan going into the phone, that you speak loud enough for the person on the other line to be able to hear you.
 Like something soothing and classy. Then speak in a light voice. "If you would like *insert name*'s phone, press 1. If you want Pizza Hut, press 2.... " etc.
 If you want to, you can use your own instrument, or you can just use your speakers and music, and sing louder or closer to the mic than the real singer. Suggestions for songs are "We Will Rock You," "American Boy," "Macarena," and "TNT."

 Take a medium size carrot, and use a vegetable peeler or knife to remove the skin. It’s important to remove all of the skin so that when you run the carrot through the sharpener, you’re only shaving off the flesh and not any of the skin., Do this until you have enough flesh to form a flower. Use a vegetable peeler that resembles a pencil sharpener and insert the carrot. Turn it to shave off the outer layers of flesh in one continuous strip. Shave the carrot until you have enough shavings to create the size of flower that you want.You can use a traditional vegetable peeler or even a knife to shave off the carrot flesh too. However, it’s more difficult to keep the shavings in a continuous strip with one of those tools, so work slowly and carefully.
 When you’ve shaved enough flesh from the carrot, carefully take the shavings off the sharpener, going slow to avoid tearing them. Using your fingers, curl the shavings into a flower shape by wrapping them around themselves.Because of the way the peeler shaves the vegetables, the carrot flesh will naturally curl in on itself, so follow the natural curve to make shaping the flower easier.
 After you’ve shaped the carrot shavings into a flower, take a toothpick and push it through the bottom where the ends of the savings overlap. That will help the flower keep its shape, so you can place it on a plate as a garnish without worrying about it coming undone.The toothpick should be able to pierce the shaved carrot flesh on its own, but if it doesn’t go through easily, use a knife to create a small hole that you can push the toothpick through.

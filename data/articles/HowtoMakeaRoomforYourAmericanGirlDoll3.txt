 Or you can use a long rectangular or long square pillow and half fold it and there is your couch.

You can also place stuffing of some sort (grass, hay, newspaper, fabric) on a rectangle of material and sew another rectangle over it. This would work well for cushions, beds, chairs, or couches.






Another alternative for a couch is to use a small basket. Either turn it upside down or fill it with stuffing and a handkerchief or scrap fabric piece to cover the filling.
 A television can be made by sticking a picture from a magazine onto cardstock and then drawing buttons around the edge. You can make a remote control with some more cardstock and a felt tip pen. Or you can get some cardboard cut it out of the shape of your remote. Look in any magazine and try to find a picture of a remote, Cut it out and glue it onto your cardboard.
 You can make shelves out of wood or just plain cardboard. Fill your shelves with items like photos, books or anything you like. You could even add a little coffee table made out of upturned basket or box.

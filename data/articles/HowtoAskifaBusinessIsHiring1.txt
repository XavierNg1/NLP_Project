 Creating a professional social media account, like one on LinkedIn, can be a great way to network with people. When the time comes, you can use that network to get info about other businesses., Once you’re interested in finding out whether a specific company is hiring, you can use this type of account to search for employees who work there. It’s best to search for recruiters or hiring managers at the company, because they'll have the information you need.If you can't find the hiring manager or a recruiter specifically, look for employees at the company in the HR department. You can contact them and ask if they can point you in the right direction.
 Once you’ve found a recruiter or hiring manager, send them a short message. Briefly outline your educational and work background and then ask if there are any open positions in your field.For example, you can write something like: “Dear Mr. Smith, I am interested in working for XYZ Plumbing, and I noticed that you are the hiring manager there. I am a certified plumber and have 6 years’ experience working as plumber for ABC plumbing, where I was promoted twice. I’d be very interested in knowing if your company has any current openings and how I might apply. Thank you very much for your time.”
If you couldn't find the recruiter or hiring manager and instead only found an employee of the company, ask them if they can put you in contact with someone in HR. You can say something like "Hi! I'm looking for any open opportunities at your company, and I was wondering if you could put me in contact with the hiring manager or recruiter." Try not to add too much information about yourself - this can overwhelm your contact, and it's not information they need unless they're in a position to make hiring decisions.

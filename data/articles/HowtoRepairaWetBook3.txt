 This method is most effective for books with only partially damp pages. Completely waterlogged pages will not fan out properly. Remove excess water via shaking or blotting., Place the book on its head, opening the covers to a 90-degree angle, and allowing the pages to fan out. Try to fan the pages out as thoroughly as possible, as this will provide the best airflow possible.Although you want the pages to be spread apart, avoid prying still-wet pages; pulling wet pages apart could result in tearing or transferring ink.
 Place the book underneath a ceiling fan, or in front of a table fan, and turn the fan on a medium setting. A low setting will not provide enough airflow, while a high setting might cause your pages to fold and wrinkle. If your fan does not have a medium setting, use the lowest setting, instead., Using a paperweight, large rock, or even a large book, compress the dried pages in the closed book, leaving them for 24-48 hours. This will help smooth any remaining wrinkles in the pages.Make sure your bookâ€™s binding is aligned properly before placing a heavy object on top of it. If the binding or covers are off-center, you may do permanent damage to the binding.
Fan-drying may not prevent wrinkling, but a heavy object on top of the cover will minimize wrinkles and expanded pages.

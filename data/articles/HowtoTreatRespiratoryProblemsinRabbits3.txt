 A clean cage is essential to preventing respiratory problems in rabbits. Each day, you should remove any leftover food, refill the water bottle with fresh water, and remove soiled bedding. Once a week, thoroughly clean the food dish and water bottle with hot, soapy water and sweep around your rabbit’s cage.Once or twice a month, do a deep clean of your rabbit’s cage. After removing everything from the cage, use a mixture of vinegar and water to clean the cage inside and out. Allow the cage to dry completely before putting items back into the cage., Stress can weaken your rabbit’s immune system, making a respiratory infection more likely. Stressors for rabbits include dirty housing and overcrowding.Keeping your rabbit’s cage clean and ensuring that it is large enough for all of your rabbits will help reduce your rabbit’s stress. If the cage is too small, consider purchasing an additional cage so each rabbit will have enough space to play, sleep, and eat.


Your rabbit may also become stressed because of boredom. Giving your rabbit lots of interesting toys to play with will keep it busy and lower its stress.
Examples of good rabbit toys are shredded newspaper and cardboard boxes with holes cut out.Switch out the toys frequently so your rabbit does not get bored with the same toys., If you bring a new rabbit home, isolate it for 2 weeks.Since respiratory infections in rabbits can be very contagious, you would not want the new rabbit infecting your other rabbits or pets. During the 2-week isolation period, monitor the new rabbit for signs of respiratory disease (e.g., runny eyes, runny nose, difficulty breathing).


If the new rabbit looks sick, take it your vet for treatment.

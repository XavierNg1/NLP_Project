 Part of what makes numbers difficult to remember is that they are symbols that don't actually correspond in any way with the quantity of things they represent. You can get around this by trying to create mental images based on the shapes of the digits.


For example, you might decide that the shape of the number 2 reminds you of a duck. You can then remember 2 as "duck." Number 10 might look like a knife next to a plate, so you could remember 10 as "knife and plate."It doesn't actually matter which images you choose to associate with which numbers, as long as they are memorable for you.;
, Some numbers might not translate well into pictures for you. In such cases, associate an image with the number that relates to the number in some other way.For example, maybe you've decided that the number 21 just doesn't look like anything to you. The number 21, however, is notable as the age at which one can legally purchase alcohol. So you might imagine a bottle of wine or beer.
 Next, put all these images together to form a single mental picture. Set the images up in your mind so you can read them from left to right like you would an ordinary number.


Using the examples above, if you wanted to memorize the number 21021, you might imagine a duck (2), pecking food off of plate with a knife laying to the left of it (10) and a bottle of beer on the right (21). Alternatively, you could imagine a plate of food with bottles of beer on each side: 21, 0, 21.
 When you need to use the number, simply call the mental picture to mind, and decode your image back into numbers.

 Wet Uggs are stinky Uggs. When water gets inside your boots, odor-causing bacteria will begin to grow and develop. If your boots get wet, let them dry completely before you wear them again.


Consider spraying your boots down with a water protection spray. This will help keep them dry during the winter months.
 Don't wear the same shoes every day. Instead, allow at least 24 hours before wearing the same pair again. This allows the old pair of shoes to dry and air out. If you really love wearing Uggs daily, consider buying two pairs, so that you can alternate them.
 This will help your boots dry faster. Remember, wet Uggs are stinky Uggs. If your boots get wet while you wear them, stick a piece of newspaper inside each boot after you take them off. The newspaper will soak up the moisture and any odors., Consider getting inserts that are labeled as "antimicrobial" or "odor absorbing/preventing." These types of inserts are specifically designed to prevent bacterial buildup. They will help keep your boots odor-free longer.
 The manufacturer may recommend wearing Uggs barefoot. Unfortunately, this allows sweat and bacteria to settle in the wool. Consider wearing some cotton or moisture-wicking socks with your boots. This will keep your boots dry and sweat-free inside., If your feet tend to get stinky, consider washing them with an antibacterial soap. This will help kill odor-causing bacteria. If your feet tend to get sweaty, dust some baby powder onto them before you slip your boots on. This will help absorb sweat.

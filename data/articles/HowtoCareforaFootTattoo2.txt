 Bad circulation causes swelling. Therefore, try to stay off your feet if you can. When you lay down, make sure that you lift your feet up.You want your feet to go up as far as you can raise them. You can place a stool under your feet if it will help you keep them up.
 Foot swelling after a tattoo is caused by your body storing excessive amounts of water. To keep this from happening, you should drink plenty of water. You want to drink enough so that your body will want to expel water instead of retaining it.
 Of course, you should not place ice directly on your tattoo. The best way to lessen swelling and keep your tattoo dry is to wrap ice in a piece of cloth and place it on your tattoo. Try doing this for thirty minutes to an hour every day you have swelling.
 You need to maintain proper circulation in order to keep swelling down. Therefore, when you are lying down, try to do some exercises. They donâ€™t need to be intense, just regular. Stretching, for example, would be beneficial.


Try lifting your legs and arms at intervals.

Alprostadil contains prostaglandin E, which increases blood flow to the genitals.



Study the effects of vitamin E when it is used directly in the vagina to increase lubrication.
Lubricants like Astroglide, KY Jelly and Replens all help lubricate the vagina.
Continued sexual activity helps maintain the menopausal woman's ability to lubricate.
Participate in regular sexual activity with your partner.

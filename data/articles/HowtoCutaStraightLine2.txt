 You will need a pair of sharp scissors (“safety” or children’s scissors won’t work), paper, a pencil, and a metal ruler. A cutting mat and sticky tack will help prevent damage to your work surface and keep the ruler in place.
 If you have a cutting mat, place the paper there. Make sure your work surface doesn’t have any bumps or bubbles, as this will affect your cutting.
 Lightly mark with dots or lines where you want your line to start and end. Don’t press too hard or the marks will be difficult to erase later.
 Place the ruler on the paper about one millimeter below where you want your line to be.
 Be careful when holding open scissors so that you don’t cut yourself. Only grip the top of the blade.









If you have craft or kitchen shears, they may separate at a center pivot point. If you can separate your blades, this may be easier and safer.
 Hold the ruler steady with one hand while you cut with the other. Pressing gently into the paper, swipe the blade of the scissors quickly along the ruler. Repeat this motion two or three more times.









Don’t press too hard with the blade or you could cause too much friction on the paper. This could end up tearing it instead of cutting it neatly.
 Using the crease you created as a guide, carefully cut along the paper with scissors.









If you don’t mind rougher edges, you can also tear the paper along the crease. This will give the edges of the paper a “fuzzy” look rather than the sharp line of scissors.
 If you can still see the pencil marks, gently erase them. Don’t press too hard on the paper with the eraser or you could tear the paper.

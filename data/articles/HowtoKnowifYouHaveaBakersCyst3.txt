 Baker’s cyst is common in people who have an underlying condition that is affecting their knees. When your knee is dealing with other causes of inflammation and pain, it becomes more likely that a cyst will develop because of that inflammation. Conditions that make it more likely that you will get a baker’s cyst include:


Rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout and psoriatic arthritis.
 If you have injured parts of your knee in the past, such as sustaining a meniscus tear or straining one of your ligaments, your chances of getting a cyst increase. This is because your knee will already be slightly inflamed; this inflammation can lead to the development of a cyst., If you did have a knee injury in the past, chances are that you had surgery to correct the injury. When your knee gets worked on, it can potentially become inflamed later if you stress it too much before it is fully healed. Like with arthritis, the inflammation caused by this stress can make you more prone to getting cysts.

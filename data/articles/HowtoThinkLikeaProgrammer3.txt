 Instead of using a standard development tool in a standard way, find ways to experiment and stretch the boundaries of what the programming framework or coding language can do. For instance, instead of coding images to appear as just images, use an image as your web page’s background.You might not be able to flex your creative muscles in your classes or workplace. Work on side projects of your own at home that you can really throw yourself into. This will keep fresh ideas flowing, and prevent you from getting bored.
 Always aim to level up your abilities. Look for projects that test your skills, or try to develop your own programming projects at home. Spend time learning more programming languages. For instance, if you only know C++, try to learn Java. These new programming languages will not only help make you more marketable to clients, but they will also help you broaden the way you think about programming and the possibilities it holds., When programmers are truly stuck, they look for advice or guidance from others who have been there before. Whether that means talking to a colleague who has more experience with your particular programming problem or consulting a programming forums, never discount the wisdom and assistance of others.Learn how to ask the right questions, too. In conversation with your colleagues, don’t just refer to the problem you’re having – refer to the end goal you’re trying to accomplish, too. Your fellow programmers might be able to provide an easier way to get your code to do what you want it to.Check out online programmer communities like Ruby on Rails and Stack Overflow.

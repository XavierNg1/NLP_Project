 This is one of the easiest and quickest bookmarks to create.
 The ribbon will be attached to the end of the paperclip and provide quick page retrieval access.
 Make sure the paperclip ends are on the opposite side from where it will be slid onto the page.
 Hold the ribbon for a few minutes until the glue has dried.

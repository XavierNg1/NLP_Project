 You will be taken to an interface to name your file and choose a save location.
 Under the filename field is a dropdown menu to select filetype. You can select various image filetypes from this menu (.jpg, .gif, .png, .bmp, and more).


By default powerpoint will save files as .pptx.
 An image copy will be saved to the selected location using the chosen filetype.


If you are saving a file with multiple slides, you will be prompted to choose to export “All Slides” or “Just This One”.

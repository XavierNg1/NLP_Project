 Write the dates of your exams in your calendar. You might want to put a star beside them to indicate their importance. Then, figure out how many days you have left before your exams. Divide the number of days left before exams by the number of subjects you need to prepare for. Now you know how many days you have available to prepare for each subject., Use your textbook and learning materials to determine the specific topic areas within each subject. English Literature, for example, may be broken down into the different books you are studying and then further into chapters, themes, or quotes. Highlight or circle the topics using different colours. Figure out how many topics or sub categories you have for each subject. Then, divide up the time you have for the subject into study blocks for each topic., If you are currently employed, you should review your work schedule for the upcoming weeks. Figure out where you can schedule study-time between your shifts.If you have a lot of upcoming shifts, consider working less so that you have more time for revisions.
 You need to figure out when your studying may be interrupted by social events or holidays, so that you can plan accordingly. If it looks like there will be a weekend when you are unable to study due to a social obligation, try to put in your revision time beforehand.

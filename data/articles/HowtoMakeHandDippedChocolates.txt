, Place in a double boiler on low heat on the stovetop (do not let water drop into your chocolate) or in a microwave in a heat-safe dish. Melt chocolate, stirring in 30-second intervals. Add a dash of cream or milk once the chocolate is completely melted to give a smooth texture to your coating. Stir thoroughly.
 Refrigerate until the chocolate is firm. Scoop chocolate into a small ball with a spoon and place on the lined sheet. Continue to form balls, placing the bowl back in the refrigerator if the chocolate begins to soften. Melt more chocolate for dipping if needed. Keep the chocolate ganache refrigerated until you are ready to dip it.
 Cover the entire surface by submerging your item in the mixture, or just dip half of the food. Carefully lift up and then dip a second time for an extra chocolate layer. Allow the excess chocolate to drip off.
 Set in the refrigerator until chocolate is firm. Serve at room temperature.

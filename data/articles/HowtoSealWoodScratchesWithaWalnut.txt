 Begin by rubbing the scratched wooden item with the walnut. Do this in a circular motion across the length of the scratch, from one end to the other.;
, Rub it back and forth several times.
 Leave the scratch for several minutes. While waiting, you're free to eat some of the walnuts if you like... or not! Meanwhile the natural oils in the nuts will be seeping into the wood, helping to heal the ugly wound.
 Take a soft cloth and polish over the whole area.
 Stop polishing and check it; your efforts should reveal that the scratch has disappeared!

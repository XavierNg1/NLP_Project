 This pasta with tomato cream sauce (i.e. red and white sauce) is delicious and easy to prepare. The overall prep time for this meal is approximately 40 minutes. This recipe will serve 6-8.2 tablespoons butter;
2 tablespoons olive oil;
4 cloves garlic, minced;
1 medium onion, finely diced;
Two 15-ounce cans tomato sauce or marinara sauce;
Dash of sugar (or more to taste);
Salt and freshly ground black pepper (to taste);
1 1/2 pounds fettuccine;
1 cup heavy cream;
Grated parmesan or romano, as needed;
Chopped fresh basil, for serving (optional).
 Mince 4 cloves of garlic and finely dice 1 medium onion. Heat 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and onions to the skillet. Sauté for approximately 1 minute., Pour the tomato sauce (or marinara sauce) into the skillet. Add a dash of sugar. Add a pinch of salt and pepper (to taste) and stir. Cook the red sauce over low heat for about 25 to 30 minutes. Be sure to stir occasionally., Cook the pasta according to the directions on the package (different brands vary) then carefully drain. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water. You might need to use this later to thin the sauce out., To remove from heat, carefully slide your skillet over to an unused burner on your stove. Stir in 1 cup of heavy whipping cream. Add the cheeses (to taste). Dip a spoon in and taste a little to gauge the seasoning (add more, if needed)., If the consistency is thicker than you’d like, add a little of the reserved pasta water, then stir again. If you’re satisfied, add the chopped basil (optional) and serve immediately. Have additional Romano and Parmesan cheeses on the dining table so that everyone can add to taste, if they wish.

 Clean the hood itself on a daily or weekly basis, but don’t worry about dealing with the filter that often (unless you happen to deep-fry a lot of foods on a regular basis). Inspect it once a month. If it appears stained or splattered, plan on cleaning or replacing it ASAP., Filters can be secured into place in a number of different ways. Give yours a look over. It will probably be attached by:A fastener that you can rotate in and out of position.
A latch that you need to press and lift.
Rim supports that just need to be pushed up and rotated.
Screws.
 If you have either of these types, do not attempt to clean them. Simply switch the old one out and install a new one. However, with charcoal filters, keep in mind that you only need to replace these if you have a ductless range hood.A ductless range hood means the exhaust fan is recirculating air right back into the kitchen. If the exhaust is being ventilated out of the house through ducts, you shouldn’t need to replace your charcoal filter.
 Fill your sink with hot water. Add dish soap or the recommended amount of a stronger cleaner (like Super Clean or OxiClean) to degrease it. Let it soak for ten minutes up to a half hour, then agitate it in the water to shake off any loose dirt. Use a bristle brush to scrub any stubborn bits.Then rinse clean under a strong jet of water (like your faucet’s sprayer attachment).After that:


Set the filter on a clean towel or drying rack and allow it to air-dry before reinstalling.

 Accessories made with thick materials can help you ease into winter and keep yourself warm. One of your staple fall outfits can be easily updated with a thick-knit scarf in a neutral scarf or beanie. You can also continue wearing bright colors in your wardrobe through the winter by limiting them to your accessories.For example, a basic black sweater and dark-wash jeans can be spruced up with a brightly colored beanie.
Update a neutral black dress with a chunky scarf in a fun pattern.
Accent a dark business suit with a tie featuring an interesting pattern., Keep your ankle boots and other lightweight boots through the transition, but add heavier, more industrial styles into the mix. Stick to dark colors like black and rich brown. Knee-high and over-the-knee boots are very popular with women. Dress boots, rugged casual boots, leather booties, snow boots, wingtips and any other styles you enjoy can help you seamlessly transition into winter.Pairing boots with lighter clothing can also help extend the life of warm-weather garments.
If you have any sandals or peep-toed shoes hanging around in your fall wardrobe, pack those away for the winter months., Since you’ll be sticking to mostly dark and neutral colored clothing in the winter, you can easily get away with accessorizing with a bold coat in an eye-catching color, print or cut. A statement coat probably won’t match all of your outfits, so consider this an accessory item only. Have other heavy coats in more neutral colors in your wardrobe to fall back on.

 You will be placing the bowl, container, or pan in the refrigerator so ensure that it is both big enough to fit all the chicken and fit inside your fridge.


Place the chicken in a pan for convenience. You will be using the pan later on to cook.
 Then cover and toss the chicken until it is completely covered with the sauce.
 Let it marinate overnight for the best results.


If you need to make the adobo in the same day, you can let your chicken marinate for 2 to 3 hours instead. However, it is always best to let your chicken marinate overnight to bring out the most flavour from the dish.
 Transfer your marinated chicken to a pan or to the stove and cook on medium heat. Add water.
 Once everything begins to boil, turn your stove to low heat.


Add more water to the mixture if you think the dish is too dry.
 Cover the skillet and let the chicken simmer until it is tender.


After 15 minutes, spoon the sauce over the chicken. Let it simmer for the rest of the remaining time.
If you like your chicken dry, let it simmer for a little longer.
 You can serve the adobon manok on top of rice, with potatoes, or with bread. And pair it with a refreshing glass of cold soda or fresh juice.

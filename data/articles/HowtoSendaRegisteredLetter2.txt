Label 200 is the form that requires official authorization for off-site printing.
This permission is generally only given to individuals who send a lot of registered mail. If this is a one-time service for you, just send it through the post office as in the previous method.
This permission is only given for domestic mail. If you’re sending international mail, go to the post office.
 This will help reduce any complications with illegible handwriting, since you won’t be there to answer any questions when the postal worker enters the information into their system. Be sure to review the form carefully before printing.
 Make sure the ink levels are healthy enough to deliver a clearly legible form.


PS Form 3806 should be printed in black and white ink, and Label 200 should be printed in color, so as to be nearly identical to the official label used by the Postal Service.
Label 200 must be printed on either 1) white OCR bond, 20-pound basis weight paper (17 inches × 22 inches) with little to no fluorescence or 2) Smudge-proof Litho Label, 50-pound basis weight paper (17 inches × 22 inches), with general-purpose, permanent-type, pressure-sensitive adhesive coating on the back.
Label 200 must be printed on adhesive paper that sticks to the letter directly. Don’t try to tape the label to the package being mailed.
 Make sure it doesn’t bend over the corners of the letter, as this might make it difficult to read some of the information on it or scan its barcode.
 Hand the filled out PS Form 3806, along with payment and the letter being mailed, to the employee at the counter.


Again, don't forget to ask for the receipt of transaction if the employee forgets to offer it to you.
 The USPS offers insurance up to $25,000 for registered mail. Rates will vary depending on how much insurance you want to purchase.

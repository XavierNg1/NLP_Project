 The paring knife is probably the most difficult tool for this job, but it has its benefits. You don't have to clog your kitchen with a one-use tool, and a sharp knife makes clean, dry cuts compared to the wet, sticky clumps other methods can produce. Keep reading to learn the technique., After washing the lemon, cut off both ends where they begin to taper. Rest a cut surface flat on the cutting board.
 Cut off a strip of rind from the side of the lemon, right where it meets the white pith. It may be easiest to start near the center of the lemon, where it bulges outward.
 Hold the strip flat against the board with one hand, yellow side down. Press the knife blade flat on top of the strip, with the blade pointing away from your hand. Scrape the top of the strip at a slight angle, removing most of the white pith.
 All this means is "cut it into thin strips." To avoid poking your fingers, hold the lemon peel in place with your fingers curled down into a "claw" shape. In this position, your knuckles are closer to the blade than your fingertips. As long as you keep the sharp edge of the knife below the level of your knuckles, you are unlikely to hurt yourself even if the knife slips.
 Gather the thin strips in a tight row, than rotate them 90ยบ. Cut the other way using the same technique as above. Try to make the zest pieces as small as possible.

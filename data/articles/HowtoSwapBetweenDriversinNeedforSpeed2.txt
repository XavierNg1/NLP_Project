 There are two ways to swap drivers in NFS World. The first is totally restarting the game. To do this, exit the game, and you can do this three ways too:


The first way is to press Esc to bring up the Options menu and then select “Exit Game.”
The second way to exit the game is to press the Alt key together with F4. You will exit the game automatically.
The third way to exit the game is by pressing the Windows key on your keyboard to return to the Windows Desktop and then closing NFSW by right-clicking its icon on the taskbar and selecting “Close.”

, You can launch the game from the Start menu or desktop, if you created a shortcut there during setup.
 Enter your username and password into the fields provided, and click “Sign in.”


After logging in, NFSW will initiate an update. As soon as NFSW has finished downloading and installing all the required updates from the Internet, a dialog box with a “Play” button will appear.
 Click on the “Play” button, and press “Enter” or any other key to display your NFSW profile details.


Here you can choose a different Driver from the list by clicking the name, and then clicking “Enter NFS World.” This will let you play the game as the new Driver you’ve chosen.

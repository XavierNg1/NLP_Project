 Getting your other senses involved can help you truly savor the taste of chocolate. Bring a small piece of chocolate up to your nose. Close your eyes and inhale the scent deeply. Try to stay present in the moment and focus all of your attention on the aroma. Breathe in the scent a few more times., Use your teeth to break off a small piece of the chocolate. Break it apart in your mouth and hold the pieces on your tongue. Raise your tongue so that it’s touching the roof of your mouth. Allow the chocolate to melt while you hold it there., As the chocolate melts, the taste buds on your tongue will start registering the flavors. Try to think of words that describe what you’re tasting. For example: sweet, salty, acidic, bitter. Take a slow and deep breath and try to describe the scent and the taste together., After it goes down, take a deep breath with your mouth open. Then close your mouth and taste any lingering flavors. Think about how to describe this flavor. Reflect on the experience as a whole. Think about whether or not you enjoyed the chocolate. If you did enjoy it, can you describe how much?

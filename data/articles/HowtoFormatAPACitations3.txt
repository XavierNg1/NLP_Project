 The main thing you need to worry about when formatting citations in your reference list is to make a hanging indention. That means that the first line of each citation will be all the way over to the left hand margin, but each line after that will be indented.
 To make a hanging indention, highlight your set of citations, then use the ruler bar at the top of the page. Click on the bottom arrow only, and move it over so that it form a half-inch indentation.
 To make sure that your page is double spaced, highlight the text, and right-click on it.


Find “Paragraph” in the list that appears. Under “Spacing” and “Line Spacing,” select “Double.”

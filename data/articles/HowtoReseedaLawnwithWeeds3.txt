 Water the newly seeded lawn just enough to moisten the soil. The seeds must be kept moist at all times in order for them to germinate (grow into grass blades). Check the soil often and water the seeds lightly as soon as the soil begins to become dry.


Watering the grass once each morning is usually enough, but your seeds may need to be watered more often if you live in a hot or windy climate.
 The seeds should germinate in about three weeks. After the seeds germinate, reduce the watering frequency but increase the amount of water given.


The amount of water you give your germinating seeds will depend on the type of grass you are trying to grow. Read the instructions that come with the seeds.
 Again, each type of grass will have its own specific instructions. Keep the grass mowed at the correct height and water it regularly to encourage a thick, healthy lawn and discourage weed growth.
 Fertilize the new grass six to eight weeks after it germinates. You do not water to fertilize the grass before this because the fertilizer could choke or damage the seeds. When you do fertilize the grass, use:


One pound of nitrogen fertilizer per 1,000 square feet.

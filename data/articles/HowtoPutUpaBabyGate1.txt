 Pressure fit gates can be installed easily without any special tools, but they do require rigid, sturdy, flat surfaces on both sides for secure attachment. They are a great choice for doorways and door frames. You’ll need the correct dimensions to make sure your gate will fit properly, though, so first measure the area where you want to install it.;
, Pressure fit gates come in various sizes and styles. Choose one that fits your measurements and suits your home’s style.


For maximum safety, check to make sure that the baby gate you purchase is certified by your local children’s product safety organization. In the United States, for example, check for certification from the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association (the JPMA).
 Before you install the gate, read the manual and make sure you follow the manufacturer’s specific directions. The details of the installation procedure may vary slightly from one brand to another.
 Attach the gate to a sturdy, flat wall or frame on both sides.


Most gates have soft pads designed to protect your walls or door frames. This will keep the gate from scratching paints and finishes.
 Every day, make sure that the mounting system is still secure and that the gate seems to be in good condition. Adjust as necessary. If you notice any problems with the gate, contact that manufacturer.

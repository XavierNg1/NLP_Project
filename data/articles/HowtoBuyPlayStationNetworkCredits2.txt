Access the PlayStation network linked to your console by selecting the PlayStation Network icon (a large "X").
Select "Account Management" (a square happy-face).
Go to "Transaction Management." Here you will see the "Add Funds" link that can be used to add PlayStation network credits the same way you would do it through the PlayStation website.

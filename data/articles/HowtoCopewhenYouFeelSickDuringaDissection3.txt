 During the dissection, there will be several things that need done aside from cutting the specimen. Most lab assignments require notes to be taken and even diagrams to be drawn of different structures. Offer to do the majority of these other tasks if your lab partner(s) perform the majority of the dissection.
 If you are hesitant about doing the dissection, talk it over with your instructor. You may feel better about the procedure after your talk, and if not you can ask for an alternative to doing the dissection., Some instructors will allow you to do a report or other written assignment in place of a dissection. A virtual dissection is also an option in some cases.Try speaking with your teacher and say something like, “I do not want to participate in the dissection. Would it be possible for me to have an alternate assignment?”
In some states, K-12 students have the right to refuse to participate in a dissection.
If you do not want to participate in a dissection, make sure that you talk to your teacher about it well before the day of the dissection. You may also have to put your intention in writing and distribute it to your teacher, principal, and other administrators in your school district., If the dissection makes you ill because of your moral objections, be sure to do your research and present that research to your instructor. You can also enlist classmates, parents, and other faculty to support your cause. Start a group or club that has the goal of ending traditional dissections in your school.It might also help to take the stance that virtual dissections are a better learning experience for students.

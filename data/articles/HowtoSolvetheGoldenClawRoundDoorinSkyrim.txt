 To solve the puzzle, you're going to have to use the Golden Claw to open the door. You obtain the claw by killing the man you freed from the webs earlier. If you don't kill him yourself, he'll get himself killed letting you loot his body.;
, Stand in front of the door and view the claw using the items menu under "Misc".
 Do so by rotating it using your mouse on a PC, or your analog sticks on consoles.

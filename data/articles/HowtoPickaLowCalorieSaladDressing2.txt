 True, fats contain lots of calories. However, choosing a fat-free option is not the best way to cut calories from your salad dressing selection. This is because certain fats help your body get vitamins and other nutrients from the other ingredients of your salad. Further, fats slow down your digestion, and keep you from getting hungry again too quickly. Finally, fats contained in the right types of oil can positively contribute to your heart’s health.When manufacturers take out the fat, they may add sugar and salt to make up for the lost flavor.
Dressings labeled “fat free” are also often heavily processed and don’t contain much nutritional value. Further, they’ll wind up making you feel hungrier sooner than dressing with a bit of fat in it.
Generally, you do want to avoid saturated fats. Most importantly, opt for dressing that have less than 0.5 grams of saturated fat per serving. Unsaturated fats, on the other hand, are those with health benefits when eaten in moderation.
 Lots of people’s favorite dressings are also the biggest calorie culprits. Worse, these are the types of dressing that also contain saturated fats. Try to skip these dressing most of the time and only have them on special occasions.For the healthiest options, opt for vinaigrettes.
 This step can be especially challenging, but it’s important. Even if you find an especially healthy dressing option, drenching your salad will ultimately add unnecessary calories to your meal. Measure out a two tablespoon serving and stick to that amount.Dress your salad with just one tablespoon initially. After a few bites, you can add the other tablespoon for a flavor boost. You may be surprised by how much differently - and sometimes better - a salad tastes with less dressing!

 Select the 'Edit' tab next to 'Organize' once you've highlighted the picture you would like to correct. These tabs should be located underneath the photo towards the bottom of your screen.;
, Try to highlight only the part of the eye that is red.
 This button is located in between the 'Enhance' button and 'Retouch' Button. You only have to press it once; if you press it multiple times, it could mess up the color of the eye.
 If there is a tiny part of red left in the eye, just repeat the same process of putting a box around that part of the eye and pressing the 'Red Eye' button.
 Sometimes, trying to fix the red eye can end up making the person's eye look worse. If this is the case, you can always press undo under the 'Edit' tab at the top of the screen.
 Don't force quit out of iPhoto, or else your editing might not be saved. Instead, eye over your final photo one more time, and quit iPhoto by pressing Command+Q, or selecting 'Quit' under the 'iPhoto' tab at the top of the screen.

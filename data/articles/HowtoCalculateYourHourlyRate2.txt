 Many people may already know their yearly salary, but in the event that you don’t, check your most recent pay stub. Use your gross (not net) pay—that is your amount before taxes—and multiply the number by the number of pay periods in a year.


For those on a bi-weekly schedule, you would multiply the number by 26.
For those whose companies offer two scheduled paydays per month, such as the 15th and 30th/31st, you will only multiply the number by 24.
 For a quick rule of thumb, you can use a standard formula such as:


7.5 hours per day x 5 days per week x 52 weeks per year = 1,950 hours worked per year.
8.0 hours per day x 5 days per week x 52 weeks per year = 2,080 hours worked per year.
 Once you have these two numbers, you can divide your totally yearly income by your total number of yearly hours to reach an approximate hourly wage.


For example, if your total income was $15,000 and your total number of hours was 2,080, then 15,000 / 2,080 = approximately $7.21 per hour.

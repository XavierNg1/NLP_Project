 Turn your iron on the lowest setting. Take a fresh dryer sheet, and gently rub the plate of the iron until all of the dirt and gunk is gone.








When you are finished, turn the heat of the iron up and iron a clean rag to get rid of any residue left behind by the dryer sheet.
 You should use white vinegar and distilled or filtered water, if it is available to you. Turn the iron on steam and iron a thick piece of cotton cloth for five minutes. Dump the vinegar solution from the reservoir and clean off the soleplate with a clean towel.









Be sure to check your ownerâ€™s manual to be sure that your iron can tolerate vinegar in the reservoir.
 Buff a bit of toothpaste directly onto a cool soleplate, being sure to hit trouble areas. Rub the toothpaste off with a clean cloth, then set the iron on steam and steam a cloth for five minutes., If there is something sticky on the bottom of your iron, turn the heat on the iron all the way up and turn the steam off. Run the hot iron over a piece of newspaper until it is clean.








If it is still sticky after this, you can sprinkle a bit of salt on the newspaper and repeat the process. This should take care of any sticky substances.

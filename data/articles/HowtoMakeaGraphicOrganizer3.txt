 Use a ruler to help you draw straight lines, and make each box about 3 inches square. This leaves room to write inside the box.
 Use your ruler to help you measure the correct side lengths of the box.
 There should now be a row along the top of your paper taken up with three 3” x 3” boxes with 1 inch of space between each.
 You should have an arrow pointing from the left box to the middle box and then from the middle box to the right box.



Write the numbers in one of the corners of the boxes, such as the top left corner. You can put an additional small box around the numbers to separate them from the text that will be written in them.
 You should now have almost identical rows of three boxes along the top and bottom of the page, with approximately 2 inches of space between the top and bottom rows.
 Therefore, you should draw an arrow to the left from the right box to the middle box and then from the middle box to the left box.



Again, you can draw small boxes around the numbers to separate them from the text that will be written inside them.
Write the numbers in the same corner that you chose for the top row so that the chart is consistent.
The top row should read “1” to “3” from left to right, and the bottom row should read “4” to “6” from right to left.
 As someone is reading the flow chart, this tells them that their eyes should jump straight down the right side of the page and not diagonally across it.
 Flow charts are extremely useful for examining a sequence of events and seeing how one thing leads to another.


Plot events in a story, such as the events leading up to the climax
How to do something, in the order of “First, you do this...” and “Next, you do that...”
Significant events in a war or historical moment, like the major events of the American Revolution that led to its conclusion

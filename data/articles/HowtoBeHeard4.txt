 The thing about being heard is that you need to do it at the right time. That means that you're not doing it all the time. Remember quantity and quality do not always go together.Sometimes what people need is a friendly ear. Being the person who listens to other people can also be really important.
Cultivate the attitude of saying things only when you feel they're important to say. People will be more likely to listen to you if they know that you talk about interesting subjects.
 You don't need to talk to everyone. You don't need to talk all the time. There are lots of times and places when people are more or less receptive to conversation and hearing you. Knowing which places are good for that will make you feel more heard in the long run.


For example: someone taking a long red-eye flight is probably going to be less receptive to your conversation than someone you're standing in a long line to a concert you both enjoy.
Likewise, that person who is wearing their headphones and staring out the bus window? Yeah, they're probably not looking to hear about all your new business selling used Ferrari automobiles.
Even receptive people can “zone out” after too long. If you’ve been talking for more than 40 seconds without a break, it’s probably time to wrap up and give the other person a chance to speak., There are times in everyone's life when all they need is a sympathetic listening ear while they vent about some injustice. Now some people are more interested in offering solutions than listening to you.


A lot of people are happy to commiserate or listen if they know that's all you need from them. If they think they need to offer solutions, they may be a little shorter with you and possibly less likely to listen.Similarly, it’s a good idea to check in with friends to see whether they want someone to problem-solve with them or just a sympathetic ear to vent to.

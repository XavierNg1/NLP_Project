 It is a proven fact that if you're cold, you get irritated and stressed more easily. Wrap up warm when you go out; wear lots of layers, get a warm scarf and a hat. Thick socks and warm boots are a definite must.;
, Whenever you're stressed, take a long, hot bath to warm you all the way through. Use scented bubble bath if you like. And remember: just because it's winter and you need to wrap up, it doesn't mean you can't look nice! Invest in a stylish winter coat to keep the cold at bay and make you look nice.
 When December starts rolling in, you need to get cracking to avoid Christmas stress. Even if you don't like to start shopping until a couple of weeks before Christmas, make a list of who you need to send presents to and what you might get them. If you're going away, make sure your flights/travel arrangements and accommodation are all booked in advance.
 Being in the sunshine stimulates the release of a hormone in your body that relieves stress, and no amount of unnatural light can create this. In winter, it is especially hard as the sunlight hours are limited. But try to get out in the sun at least once a day, even if only for a few minutes.
 Give yourself one thing that will relax you, so that when you're stressed you can leave the room and do that thing. Maybe it's eating chocolate, or taking 5 minutes to yourself. It will train your brain to relax whenever you do that thing.
 It gets your heart pumping and keeps you fit. In winter it can be hard to motivate yourself to get to the gym or go outside, but even a 10 minute walk every day is something to get you started. If exercise isn't your thing, try yoga or pilates.

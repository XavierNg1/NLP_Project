 Look for plums that are in good shape, free of blemishes, wrinkles and spots. Plums should be frozen when they are at the peak of their ripeness, deliciously sweet and flavorful. Don't freeze plums that are a little green or overripe, because they won't have good flavor or texture when you thaw them out.


Do a taste test before freezing a batch of plums. Bite into one of the plums. If purply-red juice drips down your chin, and the plum is sweet and flavorful, the rest are probably good to freeze. If it's too tart, or too grainy, you might not want to freeze this batch of plums.
If the plums are a little hard, you can leave them at room temperature for a few days to ripen. Freeze them when they are just ripe.;
, Run them under cool water and use your fingers to gently rub their skin. Rinse away any dirt or debris.
 Use a sharp paring knife to slice them into wedges about an inch thick. Discard the pits and stems. Continue slicing the plums until you've processed the whole bunch.
 Spread them out in a single layer, with no overlapping, so that they don't stick together when they freeze. Cover the baking sheet with a layer of plastic wrap.
 Put the whole tray of plums in the freezer and leave it inside until the plums are firm and dry, and no longer sticky. It should take about an hour to get them to this stage.
 Fill the bag to within an inch of the top, and squeeze out as much excess air as possible (or use a vacuum sealer, which sucks out the air for you). You can use a straw to suck out the extra air and close the bag tightly. Air trapped in the bag will cause the plums to get freezer burn more quickly.


Dry-frozen slices of plum will keep in the freezer for up to 6 months.
To keep plums for longer than 6 months, you need to pack them in syrup to prevent freezer burn.
 Frozen plum slices are perfect to add to smoothies or use in cobblers and other desserts. They also add a cute decorative touch when added to cocktails or fruity drinks in place of ice cubes.

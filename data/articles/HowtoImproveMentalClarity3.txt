 We all have different body clocks, and each of us works better at a different time of day. Many people find that early morning is the time when their mind is most clear -- for others, itâ€™s late at night, just before bed. Whatever time you naturally gravitate toward, schedule tasks for that time that require the most clarity.
 For some people, working in total silence in a familiar place affords them the most clarity. Others like the background hum of a coffee shop. The location that helps you focus the most will be the place where you can do your best work -- find it!

, If you know you need to do something that requires a great deal of thought, create a routine that helps to get you focused and free of outside thoughts. Continuing to do the routine anytime you need mental clarity will help train your mind to achieve that state more easily every time.


Make yourself a cup of coffee or tea before you begin and think about the task ahead as you make your beverage.
Take a shower before you begin.
Put on comfortable clothing that helps you relax and focus.
Listen to a favorite song before you begin.

 Realizing why someone hurt you will go a long way towards helping you not care about it, as it will help you understand and empathize with them and what they did. If you understand someone’s reasons for doing something, it becomes harder to judge them and hold it against them.


Maybe they hurt you because they are hurt, or lonely, or afraid. Maybe they hurt you because they worry that you’ll hurt them first. Maybe they don’t have a good example from their own lives of how to love others or treat people well. There are a number of reasons why people hurt other people, intentionally or unintentionally.
 If someone hurts you or otherwise shows that they don’t appreciate you and your role in their life, just understand that it is their loss. If they want to be angry or hurtful or alone, that is going to affect them much more negatively in the long run than it will affect you. Realize that your time and affection are much better spent on someone who appreciates you.
 Take the time to appreciate the people who do care about. There are plenty of people who love you and love being around you. These friends, family members, coworkers or teachers are much more worth your time than someone who is all wrapped up in their own problems.
 When this hurtful person leaves your life, find new people to care about. This will give you new purpose and happiness and help you forget the things that they did. When you find new, wonderful people who appreciate you for who you are, you will find that all the things that other jerk did suddenly don’t matter to you at all. It’s hard to be hurt and angry when you’re so happy!

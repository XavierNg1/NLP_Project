 Not a full mouthful, but a little is fine.
 After the first couple words (right as the actual music starts), come out and stand at the entrance with a water bottle. Stay there as you look at the ground, then slowly look up straight ahead. You can look around if you wish., Take a few steps and spray out the water while shaking your head. The spraying may take a few times to perfect if you tend to stream it out., Look around to the "crowd" and proceed to walk towards the right hand side of the ring (your right)., If the ring is indoors, especially on carpet, be sure the cap is closed., Place your right hand (thumb out) on the top rope and your left hand at your side. Stare around for a few seconds. Then look as if you're flexing your muscles in a downwards position and put your head down. Flare up your arms and head while bending backward towards the ring rope. As soon as you flare up, spray out the water again. You didn't swallow that last sip, did you?,

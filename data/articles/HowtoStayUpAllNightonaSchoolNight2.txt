 Though you do have all night, you'll get more done if you start as soon as possible. Start right away, and don't cheat by telling yourself you're going to begin at a certain time. Procrastination is procrastination.
 If you have a lot of work to get done, try to separate your mind from your life so that you can deal with the lack of sleep and work you need to do. All you should think about is the work you need to complete. Do not get upset, and don't let your emotions take over. Focus, be determined, and do not give up on yourself.
 It's hard to concentrate for a long time without short mental breaks, so don't feel bad for taking them. Take longer breaks as well: read something that hasn't anything to do with what you're studying, eat something, paint your nails, or watch one (just one!) episode of your favorite show.


When you have trouble with a task, don't keep torturing yourself! Do something else, drink something, eat something, do something different for a while and come back to the task later.
Don't stay in the same position all the time! It isn't healthy to sit still for too long, and you may find that you tire out over time. Stand up, walk a bit, stretch â€“ and you may be able to return to studying with renewed energy and enthusiasm.
 The social engagement will keep your mind active and give you a reason to stay up. You can talk to another night owl on the phone, in person, or over instant messaging. If you're staying up to finish a project or assignment, try not to slip into a deep conversation, or you may become distracted.

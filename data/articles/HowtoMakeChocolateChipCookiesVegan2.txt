 Prepare two large light baking sheets by lining with parchment paper. Set aside the baking sheets and get out a large mixing bowl and whisk., Use your whisk to mix as well as possible. Mix thoroughly for about two minutes until the mixture resembles a fine caramel. Make sure not to slack off on this step - it is important to completely emulsify the sugar and oil. Don't be lazy about this! After the previous ingredients are combined, add the vanilla., Mix until there are there are only little lumps left, then add the rest of the flour. Mix the batter so the flour is fully incorporated. Afterwards, mix the chocolate chips in. It should work alright to stir with a large spoon, but if the dough is a little stiff, use your hands to really combine everything., Bake for 8 minutes until the cookies are barely browned on the edges. You will need to put each pan in the oven twice - this recipe should fill four pans. You will need to have paper towels ready so that you can have a place to slide the cookies off the pan and scoop out more dough while the other pan is in the oven. Cool the cookies on the baking sheet for a little while, then move them to a rack of paper towel. Once they are only slightly warm, you can enjoy these scrumptious pleasures in your mouth. Wait until room-temperature to put away to store.

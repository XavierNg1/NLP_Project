;
, Start playing like you normally would, saying the chant that goes with it. In case you don't know it, here it is: Hot potato, pass it on, pass it on, pass it on, hot potato, pass it on before you burn yourself!

, Whoever has the ball at the end of the chant has to do a dare. The other player is the one in charge of assigning it.
 When the loser carries out the dare, keep playing!

 The key to meeting girls is getting out. Don't be overly involved in your school's activities.;
, In other words, a relaxed local cafe would be more advisable than a mall or movie theater. Independent theaters and small scale concerts are exceptions (and quite advisable venues).
 They will have more female friends than you (female friends to whom you will be a novelty), or they will at least have a better idea of what girls in the area do for fun.
 Try to attend all these events.
 This would include popped collars, golfing clothes, excessive khakis, etc. However, some girls may like this.
 This is really important. Most of the time they are not going to do the work for you.

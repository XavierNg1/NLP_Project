 If you want a stronger drink, use ice cubes. The crushed ice will give the drink a slightly water, almost slushy-like texture that many people enjoy. However, a stronger drink needs less ice and less coolness, so cubes are a better bet., If you don't feel like measuring out the ratios, use a simple count. Pour one second of vodka, one of sour apple schnapps, and two seconds of apple juice. If you want more, simply keep the ratio the same and count for longer -- four seconds for juice, and two for the liquor, for example.


As long as the vodka-schnapps-apple juice ratio stays 1-1-2, you can add as much liquid as you want.
 This takes anywhere from 5-15 seconds. The longer you shake, the colder the drink will be. Note, however, that colder drinks tend to have less of the alcoholic bite that many people like in their drink., Keep your glasses in the freezer before using to ensure they are cold when the drinks are poured. If you forget to put the glass in the freezer, fill them with ice water for 3-4 minutes to get them cold quickly. Then pour out the water and pour in your drink.
 Most commonly this will be a slice of apple, but enterprising bartenders will try anything, including Jolly Ranchers, a drizzle of caramel, and cocktail cherries.

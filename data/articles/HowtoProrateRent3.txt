 Depending on if you are going to use either the “days in a year” or “days in a month” method to calculate your prorated rent amount, determine the respective cost of your utilities.


For example, your utilities might be 50$/month, or 600$/year.
 For whatever method you are using, add the calculated utility cost to the calculated rent cost to create a sum of total money you owe the landlord per month, or per year. Include here other landlord paid/reimbursed expenses if applicable.


In mathematical format: rent rate + utility rate = total $$ you owe the landlord
For example, if monthly rent is 900$ and monthly utilities is 50$, then your total sum of money owed to the landlord each month is 950$.
For example, If yearly rent is 10,800$ and yearly utilities is $600, then you owe the landlord $11,400 each year.
 Use either the “days in a year” or “days in a month” method to calculate your prorated rent amount. In your equations, replace your total monthly or yearly rent amount with this calculated total sum of rent and utilities.For monthly rent: ANSWER = x # of days you’re staying
For yearly rent: ANSWER = x # of days you’re staying

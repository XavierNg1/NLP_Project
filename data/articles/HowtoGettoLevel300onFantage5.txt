 The Top Models Inc. is downtown, where you can do a bunch of fashion shows. In a fashion show, the host will pick a color or something, like blue or dark, and you have to put on as much blue as possible. After that, you have to pose for the cameras. Try to win or be runner up. You go up lots of levels if you win fashion shows.
 Hosts or hostesses are able to pick the topic, like red or animal. Also, if you host a lot of fashion shows, you get a medal and go up levels.
 Fantage has a lot of holiday celebrations, so make sure you go on Fantage often. When they have a holiday celebration, they'll give you a medal if you go online Fantage every day of the celebration.

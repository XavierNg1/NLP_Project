 There are a large number of both free and paid apps available. You can browse by category, popular, or search for specific apps. For paid apps, you will either need to purchase an iTunes card from a store, or input your payment information.


To enter your credit card information, go to the Home screen and tap Settings. Select iTunes & App Stores. Select your Apple ID and enter your password. In the Edit section, select Payment Information. Enter your credit or debit card information, then tap Done.
 Before buying an app, browse through some reader reviews to see if other users are enjoying their purchase. Also be sure to check the requirements. Some older apps are not optimized for newer iPads, and may not function correctly, or at all.


In the Requirements section, it will list what devices the app is compatible with. Make sure you are not accidentally purchasing an app for iPhone that is not designed for the iPad.
 This bar will show you how long until it is finished downloading and installing.
 This will create folders that you can use to keep your Home screens from getting cluttered.

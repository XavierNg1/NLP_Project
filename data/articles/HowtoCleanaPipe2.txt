 Epsom salt is good but table salt works too.
 This container should be as close as possible to the size of the pipe. It should also need to be fairly sturdy (not made of super cheap plastic) because you will be putting harsh chemicals or very hot water into it.
 Now, which cleaning solution you should use is a matter of debate. Rubbing alcohol works great but it can destroy the colors of your pipe or possibly leave unhealthy residues. Alternatively you can use vinegar or Listerine and mix it with very hot water. Whatever you use, pour the mix into the container.
 Swish it around and let it soak for at least five minutes.
 Take it out of the cleaning solution and rinse it really thoroughly with hot water. Be careful not to drop your pipe while rinsing.
 Use pipe cleaners, Q-tips, and paper towels to remove any remaining residue.
 If you havenâ€™t cleaned your pipe in a long time, it make take two or three rounds of this process before it is completely clean. Clean your pipe regularly to avoid this.









Make sure your pipe is thoroughly rinsed before smoking with it!

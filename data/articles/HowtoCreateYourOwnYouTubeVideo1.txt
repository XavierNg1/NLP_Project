 It doesn't have to be anything special, but it has to be cool and interesting enough to intrigue YouTube viewers. Ask yourself the following questions and write the answers.


How long will my video be? YouTube limits video length to 15 minutes. If you want your video longer than 15 minutes, post it in another video. (ex: Part One, Part Two, etc.).
What environment will my video be in? You may have to change the settings on your camera.
Is the topic I am recording interesting? Would anyone watch? If the beginning of your video is boring, viewers won't waste time watching the rest of it. Don't make a video only you are interested in, unless you're uploading it just for fun.
 You don't want to be in the middle of making a video when you realize something is not in place!


If you're narrating, speak in a loud, clear voice so viewers can hear you. Drink water before you start recording. Keep a bottle of water within reach and don't drink noisily while recording!

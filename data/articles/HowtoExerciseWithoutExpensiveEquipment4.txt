 When you feel some meaningful strain, stop. This might be as few as 5 or 10, perhaps even less. You need to start small in order to get best results.
 You will want to work up to doing 10 sets a day, but, for starters, 3 is probably a good number to shoot for. If you punish yourself now, you will not keep up your program for very long.
 It is easy to put your butt up in the air and/or not go all the way down to the floor, or otherwise "cheat" on your form. But, if you do this, you will not be getting the value of your exercising. Your knees should be nearly locked, and your arms will be carrying the full load of your push-up. Your chest should nearly (but not quite) brush against the floor. With each push-up, your arms will be completely extended when you raise yourself up fully.
 Do the number you are comfortable with every day or day and a half, as this leaves time for your muscles to rebuild, strengthen and get bigger. You can take one day a week off, if you are feeling the effects of your routine too much.
 Be sure to tighten all of your muscles and they will build. You will need to be able to push yourself to get to your set goal for that week.
 Be sure to tie in push ups with other exercises too.
 During a TV commercial, before your shower, in a vacant room at work. It will only take a few seconds for each set.

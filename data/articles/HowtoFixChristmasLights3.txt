 Each Christmas light bulb has a "shunt" that is supposed to close the gap when the bulb burns out. This often fails, but a small surge of current can trigger this and put your lights back on.This will not work every time, especially with this DIY approach. If you're looking for quick results, try the methods above instead.
 This type of lighter has a piezoelectric crystal which creates a spark when pressed. Do not use the type with a metal wheel, which creates the spark through friction.
 If the lighter is disposable, just burn the fuel away. If the lighter is refillable, transfer the lighter fluid to another lighter, or to a sealed, clearly labeled fire-proof container.


Never dispose of lighter fluid in a drain or in household trash.
 Pry apart the plastic cover, then lift out the igniter with a pair of needle nose pliers.The piezo igniter includes a button, and two tiny metal or plastic prongs. When the button is pressed, a spark jumps between these prongs.


The spark is not dangerous, but it will give you a mild electric shock. More importantly, it could ignite fumes and light a small flame. Work over a nonflammable surface and keep your fingers and face away from the sparker during removal.
 Position the two prongs of the sparker against the two prongs of the Christmas light plug. Push the button about 10â€“20 times. You should hear a click and see a spark each time.


If it's too hard to line up the prongs, connect them with insulated wires.
 If all went well, the lights should now light up. There will be one or two dead bulbs, which should be replaced as described below. Leaving the dead bulbs on will cause the other bulbs to burn out sooner.

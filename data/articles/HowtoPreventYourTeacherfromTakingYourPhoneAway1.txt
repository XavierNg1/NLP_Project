 A school administrator has the right to confiscate your phone if doing so corresponds with your school’s student code of conduct. This code outlines the rights and responsibilities of students and teachers, as well appropriate disciplinary measures to be taken in response to infractions. Rules vary by school, and it is the right of every student to read and understand them fully; if the regulations are not available on your school’s website, ask an administrator for a copy., While your school might have specific regulations concerning cell phones, your teachers may be strict or lenient about how they enforce them. Be sure to note anything a teacher says about cell phone use in class at the beginning of the semester. If they don’t specify their policy (and the corresponding penalties), ask them directly. For example, you might ask: “Do you have any specific rules regarding cell phones in your classroom?"If you do not feel comfortable approaching them about the subject directly, try asking former students a year or two ahead of you what the teacher’s rules about cell phones were, and what the consequences of defying them were.
 If you use your cell phone during an exam, your teacher will likely confiscate it for several reasons. Aside from distracting other students, your smart phone is a tool that can easily be used to cheat on a test; students can access saved notes, text answers to other students, or look up answers online. With cheating via cell phones becoming more prevalent, your safest bet is to keep yours far out of reach during test periods.To make sure that your teacher does not suspect you of cell phone use during a test, bury your phone at the bottom of your bag or leave it in your locker.

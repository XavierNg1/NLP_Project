 People don't use send one another emails with no reason, so try creating one. Ask them to send you a picture, a link, or some other information, and suggest they do it via email.;
, Replying to a received email is a big motivator; send your friend something neat, or ask him/her a question via email, and you may receive a response.
 The easiest way to get an email is to ask for one - if receiving an email is important to you, and your friend cares about your feelings, he or she will probably send one.
 Be up front: Say, "Why haven't you emailed me?" and hear what he or she has to say. There may be a perfectly reasonable answer.
 Let her or him stew for a while.


If your friend rings you, say you don't want to talk because she or he is not emailing you.
 Only resort to this if you have some very important reason that the friend needs to email you, since it might disrupt your friendship irrevocably. Let him or her know it's very important to you, and why; tell them your friendship is conditional on the email (if for some reason it is). How you approach this will depend on the scenario at hand - the important part is explaining just why it's so important, so that they can take your feelings and needs into account.

 Submerge the plastic in a container of cooking oil for 12-24 hours. Canola, vegetable, and other oils will soak into the sticker and loosen the adhesive. This will make it easier to remove later. You can try the method again if it doesn’t work the first time and then gently peel the sticker off with a razor blade.
 The oils in peanut butter will break down many adhesives. Cover the sticker in a thin layer of peanut butter—any type of peanut butter will do. Let it sit for a few minutes before wiping it off with a sponge and warm, soapy water.
 The oil in the mayonnaise breaks down the sticky residue leftover from the sticker. Any type of mayonnaise will work for removal. Rub some mayonnaise over the residue. Allow it to sit for fifteen minutes. Then, wipe it off with a dry cloth.








You may have to repeat this process if the residue is thick or does not come off the first time.

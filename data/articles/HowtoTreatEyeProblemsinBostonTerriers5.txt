 The lens of your dog's eye might seem cloudy and bluish-gray. The cataract covering the lens can look crackly or like a chip of ice. It may appear suddenly or develop over several years. Eventually, as the cataract covers more of the lens your dog may go blind.The Boston terrier is a breed that is genetically predisposed to developing cataracts early in life or as part of the aging process.
 Blurred vision caused by cataracts can make it difficult for your dog to see and you may notice his behavior become clumsier. He may seem less sure of his surroundings. To compensate for this loss of vision, you might notice your dog develop a high-stepped walk. You may also notice your dog:Bumping into things.
Not recognizing people.
Misjudging distances.
 If you think your Boston terrier has cataracts, make an appointment with the veterinarian as soon as possible. The vet can usually make a diagnosis simply by looking at your dog's eyes and a veterinary surgeon can confirm the diagnosis.If your dog is older, the vet will determine if your dog has cataracts or if his eyes are simply changing as part of the aging process.
 If your dog has a large cataract interfering with his vision, consider getting it removed. Cataracts are usually treated by surgically removing the lens and replacing it with an artificial one. This treatment requires specialist surgery which can be expensive. Surgery can restore vision, but it's important to do the surgery before your dog's vision gets too bad.You could also consider getting the cataract broken down by a laser. This procedure is called phacoemulsion. It's also an expensive specialist procedure.

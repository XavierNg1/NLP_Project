 When a letter arrives, a tiny blue blinking icon appears over your house’s mailbox. Interact with it by pressing A (or tapping in WW and NL), and you can see an unopened letter at the side of the screen that pops up.

If the letter has a present in it, the letter icon will have a tiny gift box added to the graphics!

, Select the mail by scrolling with your D-pad (or tapping), and select the “Read” option to see what they said.

If you’re impatient though, you can skip the reading bit, and backtrack with the B button or selecting the “Cancel” button.
 Whether you choose to read it or not, pull up your inventory ( - on City Folk, X in New Leaf, and Y in both the original and Wild World versions). You’ll see your mail in a separated section of the inventory. Select the letter, and select the “Present” option. It will drop a wrapped gift box in your main inventory., Select the present and choose “Open,” and if whoever sent it was feeling extra generous, you’ll find yourself with some new furniture!

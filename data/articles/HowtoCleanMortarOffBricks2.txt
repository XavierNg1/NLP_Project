 Ensure that the mortar has had at least 7 days to dry before trying to remove the dried on mortar. Saturating the wall with water before you chisel will make removing the mortar easier and can protect your bricks from being damaged. Fully saturate the brick before you start working with a garden hose or with buckets of water., Hold the chisel at a 20° to 30° angle against the face of your wall on areas that have built-up mortar. Lightly tap on the end of the chisel and start to break the dried up mortar from off the wall. Start from the top and work your way to the bottom. Continue to work slowly and carefully until most of the mortar is removed from the wall.Break up larger pieces of mortar into smaller more manageable pieces instead of trying to remove it all at once.
Lime mortar is easier to remove than cement based mortar using this method.
 Go in a back and forth motion over the face of the brick to remove any broken up mortar dust. Try to scrape off any stubborn mortar that wasn't removed from chiseling. Do not spend too much time in one area or you may discolor the brick in that area.

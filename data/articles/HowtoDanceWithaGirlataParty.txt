 Be sure to ask her calmly. Don't go crazy, just casually say, "wanna dance?" or "would you like to dance?" You don't want to look desperate, but you do want to look independent and responsible. If she says no, don't freak out or anything. Just say, "Okay, maybe some other time" or something like that. If she says yes, just smile and bring her out to the dance floor.


Introduce yourself. You don't want her to have no idea who she was dancing with!;
, Follow the music and everyone else. Girls love it when you hold their hand, so do that. Hold her hand softly, though, and don't squeeze it to death. Hold hands and dance normally. You will get the beat soon.

 Ask her questions like, "what's your favorite song?" but minimize the talking. She won't hear over the music! Don't ask too personal questions, but questions like, "what's your cell-phone number?" may be appropriate if you were planning on asking her out.
 Don't just stay with one! Be sure to come back to her, though, if you like her and want to continue dancing with her. Dance with some other pretty girls to get her to come back to you, but be sure not to dance with SO many people, because they'll all come back to you.
 Dancing is so much fun! Don't worry that she's not having fun or anything; most girls will be overjoyed that someone asked them to dance! If she wants to leave, she'll tell you so, but for the meantime, just dance away! Don't get careless, though, and step on her feet because you're having so much fun, for example.
 If it is a formal dance thank her for dancing with you. If it's a casual dance, then say that was fun and smile.

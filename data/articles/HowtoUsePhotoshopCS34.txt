 You can do this by adjusting Layers, Curves, Hue, Saturation, or a combination of these. These may be accessed in the "Adjustments" sub-menu from the Image menu.


Curves will adjust the lighting by modifying the contrast and saturation.
Hue is a color or shade of an image. Adjusting this value will change the entire color of the image.
Saturation can also be thought of as brightness. For example, the difference between a bright fire truck and a deep red can be thought of as saturation of the color red., Photoshop is also a powerful canvas for painting. The icons from the band-aid down to the teardrop are all tools used for painting.The brush allows for an incredible variety of paints and textures to be added to the image. You can even create your own textures to use with the paintbrush. Use the paintbrush by holding down the left mouse button and moving the cursor wherever you want to paint.
The brush icon with the teardrop next to it will mix colors together. This is useful if you want to blend two separate areas of the image together with each other., One way of isolating a modification is by creating an adjustment layer. This will be a layer that solely adjusts either one layer or all layers. There are a lot of easy-to-use adjustments which can be found in the Image drop-down sub-menu.

 Like any other bird, only the female lays the eggs. Itâ€™s easy to tell a quails gender and there is more than one way.


Observe their behaviour. Male quails tend to be more aggressive than females.
Look at their feathers. Most male quails will have brighter feathers around their neck, head and back whilst females will have more plain colours.;
, Quails can get stress from all the new surroundings and from the long move. It can take up to 2-6 weeks for quails to settle in and start laying eggs whilst some quails can settle in straight away and start laying eggs 2 days after moving.
 You should have 1 square foot of floor space per quail. Any more space will allow your quail room to roam but any less and they will get stress from close confinement.
 These are high on calcium which is what a quail needs to lay good eggs.
 Either hang lights near their cage or move their cage to a sunny/light area, this increases egg production in quails.


Give them 14-16 hours of light per day. Any more and your quails may suffer from exhaustion as they do need time to rest and sleep.
If you move your quails cage outside make sure they are not near danger and cannot escape (it will be quite a task to find them again).
 Quails need a calm quiet area to stimulate laying and disturbing them may also cause stress.
 They may disturb or scare the quails which will be the reason for not laying eggs.
 Some quails like building nests to lay their eggs in whilst others will lay them anywhere.
 You will not only destroy their nest but you will also disturb them as well.


Clean the cage once every 2 weeks. This includes rinsing the water and food bowls, disposing of all bedding and scrubbing the cage.

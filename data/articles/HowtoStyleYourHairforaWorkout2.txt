 This may work best if you have shorter hair that can easily be secured in pigtails. To start, simply brush out your hair and part it in the middle. Separate your hair into two sections. Use a hair band to secure one section near the nape of your neck. Repeat this with the other section. This should leave you with two pigtails.
 Braided pigtails adds a little eloquence to a workout look while also keeping your hair out of your face. Brush out your hair and part it in the middle. Separate your hair in two even sections. One at a time, braid each section and secure the braids with a hair tie.








Strive for looser braids, which will be more comfortable and less distracting during a workout.
If you already have cornrows, try tying them into pigtails for a braided pigtail look., Separate your hair into two sections. Twist one section and proceed to wrap the section into a knot-like bun. Secure the bun with bobby pins or a hair tie and repeat the same process on the other side.








Pigtail buns work on most hair types, but many people with shorter hair find them to be a particularly quick, easy style for hair that's on the short side.

 Remember, your purse will be half this size.


Avoid fabrics that are too thin or sheer. Your tape needs something to cling to and shouldn't let the duct tape show on the inside.
 This makes it secure when you're working with the tape.


Decide what kind of colors and patterns you want for your purse before you go any further. You are not limited to vertical or horizontal strips; make any pattern you want or cut up the tape into shapes.
 The tape should cover all of the fabric and leave none exposed.


Go past the fabric an inch (2.5 cm) or so. Taping to the table or floor should not be an issue (use a clean surface!).
Overlap the tape as uniformly as possible.
 Peel your piece off your surface and turn it over, fabric side up.


Turn over your purse. You should see a giant rectangle of duct tape.
 Don't tape up the top!


This serves as the seam and can be a completely different color or pattern of tape.
It's easier to lay the duct tape (the seam) sticky side up on the table and put the purse on top to meet it.
Trim the excess with scissors.
 This is the trickiest part.


Before you insert the seam into the bottom of the bag, fold it onto itself to make it un-sticky. Then insert it; it should be much easier to manipulate.
The seam should be tucked into the fabric, disappearing.
 This gives it structure.


Tape along the bottom one strip of duct tape. This gives it a base.
Tape one strip along each side. This gives it a sturdy left and right.
Tape along the top to remove any rough edges.
 This serves as your strap.


Make it a bit longer than you need; a bit will be used to be knotted or taped to the inside.
 There should be simple directions on the package.


If you don't have grommets, you can stick to a plain duct tape strap. Duct tape is very sturdy and won't budge; however, grommets give your purse a more professional look.
 Your duct tape purse is complete.


Tape the rope in place or tie in a knot to secure.

 Express your point of view or needs in a way that is clear and direct. You want to come off as aggressive, not disrespectful.Make sure you have someone's full attention before talking. Talk face-to-face, not to their back.Say their name when addressing them.Be honest with the person you are confronting, but remember to listen to their point of view as well.
 Sounding condescending, accusing, or overly aggressive can make a situation escalate.


Words such as "always" or "never" tend to exaggerate statements and are good to avoid.Bring the conversation back to yourself. Use "I" instead of "you" statements, such as "I feel..." or "I don't like it when...". Follow these with facts., Shouting, whispering, or speaking with a shaky force will undermine anything you say.Speak at a level you would use for a normal conversation.
Pleading or whining will make you sound desperate or emotionally dishonest.
Speak in a clear, steady voice and do not hesitate.
If you are preparing to confront someone, practice what you want to say in advance in front of a mirror.
 If you feel like someone is trying to take advantage of you or asking you to do something you feel is unreasonable (e.g. borrow money), do not feel guilty telling them "No".


Follow these basic principles of saying "No": be brief, clear, firm, and honest.You can justify your response, but be brief and avoid excessive excuses.
Do not start every sentence with "I'm sorry". Being overly apologetic will make you look immature or insincere.
Reinforce your refusal with assertive body language. Maintain direct eye contact, hold your head up, keep your back straight, and relax your face and shoulders.

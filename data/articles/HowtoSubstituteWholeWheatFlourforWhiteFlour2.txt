 Whole wheat flour has a much stronger flavor than regular flour, and can sometimes impart a bitter flavor to baked goods. To combat this, try replacing two tablespoons of the liquid used in the recipe (water/milk) with orange juice.


The orange juice is sweet and full of natural sugars, so it will compensate for the bitter flavor of the wholewheat.
 Adding wheat gluten to whole wheat flour when making bread helps the bread rise better.The gluten can further be assisted by a process called ‘sponge’.


According to this method, half of the flour should be mixed with yeast which has been proofed. This mixture can be left to sit for a couple of hours before baking.
This process helps to strengthen the gluten by retaining the carbon dioxide released by the yeast. This helps the bread rise higher and better.
For each teaspoon of wheat gluten you use, add an addition 1 1/4 teaspoon of water., For softer baked goods like cakes and muffins, regular whole wheat can produce a harder, chewier result, which isn't necessary the effect you want to achieve. To overcome this, white whole wheat flour instead.


White whole wheat flour is made from a softer, lighter-colored type of wheat, whose taste isn't as strong as regular whole wheat.
White whole wheat flour has the same nutritional content as regular whole wheat, the difference in texture and flavor comes from the environmental conditions under which the wheat is grown.

 MovieStarPlanet has a free app for both Android and Apple mobile platforms, although it's commonly accepted that the computer version contains fewer glitches and better overall gameplay. For this trick, however, you'll need the mobile app., If you don't already have an account with MovieStarPlanet, you'll need to make one by tapping "New User" and following the instructions.
 This is on the right side of your screen, directly above the "New User" button.
 These should correlate with the ones you use on the computer version if you do so.
 This is at the top of the "Games" screen., "On Location" works by giving you Fame whenever you complete a swipe. You can do so by tapping the top, middle, or bottom third of the game's screen.


You receive two Fame for each successful swipe (roughly a second of game time). If you chain together multiple swipes by tapping the top, middle, and bottom in succession, you can make six Fame per two seconds or so.
 This will generate Fame. As long as you don't mind grinding for a few minutes, your character will rapidly level up.
 Please be aware that the game can crash due to too much happening on-screen if your phone or tablet uses too much RAM; if this happens, simply restart and pick up where you left off.

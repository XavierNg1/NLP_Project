 Body language can go a long way in helping you see whether or not the girl really likes you. Her words may not tell you that she likes you, but her body can give her away. If the girl really likes you, then she may turn her body toward you and try to lean in when she's talking to you so she can get a little closer. Here are a few more signs that she's into you:


See if she twirls her hair or looks down at her feet. This means that she's feeling shy and nervous about talking to you because she likes you.
See if she shuffles her feet or plays with her hands or jewelry. This is another sign that she's fidgeting because she likes you.
See if she breaks eye contact. If you share a moment of intense eye contact and then she looks away, it may mean that she's feeling shy about talking to you.
Check out her smile. Does she smile when she's talking to you, even you don't say anything that should make her smile? This may mean that she likes you.;
, Do you notice that she dresses up more when she knows she'll be around you? If you know you'll be running into her at the mall and she's all dressed up and wears more makeup than usual, it may be for you. If she knows she'll see you on the weekend and puts on a new dress, she may be trying to look good for you.


She may also put on a hint of perfume if she knows she'll be around you. If you don't think she wears perfume during school but suddenly puts it on when you're at a group hang at the movies, it may be for you.
 This is a dead giveaway that she really likes you. If you catch her blushing after you look at her, or if her face turns bright red in the middle of a conversation with you, then she's feeling shy because of how much she likes you. Observe her for a while. See if she's the kind of person who's just really shy, or if she blushes only for you. If she only blushes in front of you, then she thinks you're special.

 After meeting the necessary educational and certification requirements, an Xray technician is expected to have the following skills and abilities:


attention to detail and ability to follow directionsstrong interpersonal skills and an ability to put distressed or injured patients at easestrong math skills, especially when required to mix and administer chemicals for certain imaging proceduresability to stand for long periods and physically lift patients who need assistance before, during, and after imagingtechnical skills and ability to operate and maintain imaging equipment;
, Anyone interested in becoming an Xray technician will first be required to complete a formal postsecondary education at an accredited institution. The Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology offers an online search engine to find an accredited educational program by program/degree type, program name, or location.


Once you find a program that meets your needs, you'll need to complete the application procedure and enroll in that program.
 The most common major for aspiring Xray technicians is Radiography, but other areas of study may be acceptable, provided that the coursework for that major focuses on human anatomy, pathology, patient care, and radiation physics and protection.Common areas of study for aspiring Xray technicians include:


RadiographyNuclear Medicine TechnologyRadiation TherapyMagnetic Resonance ImagingSonography, Programs that offer an associate's degree in Radiography are most common, as this degree path meets the basic requirements of most employers, but students may wish to complete a bachelor's degree or even a graduate degree to gain additional experience and education., Some certification boards, such as the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) in the United States, require candidates to meet certain ethics requirements.The particular ethics and certification requirements will vary depending on what country you reside in. Candidates residing outside the United States should search online to find out their national or regional certification boards.


The AART requires all prospective candidates to agree to follow the Registry's Rules and Regulations, as well as the Standards of Ethics. These rules and ethics codes can be found on the AART website.
As part of the certification process, the ARRT requires all candidates to disclose any and all convictions, criminal procedures, or courts-martial, as well as any previous loss of professional license, registration, or certification., Candidates who have completed the education and ethics requirements must then pass a qualifying examination. The ARRT administers their computer-based exams at over 200 test centers across America, with additional locations in Frankfurt, Istanbul, London, Seoul, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto, Vancouver, and Winnipeg.The examination typically takes three and a half hours to complete.There is a $200 application fee required to take the exam, and a $175 fee for candidates re-taking the exam.The specific content of the exams is laid out in the certification and registration handbook, under Appendix B. The appendix will also cover the number of questions posed in each section of the exam.The handbook and additional information can be found on the ARRT website.
The results of the exam may take up to three weeks due to processing time. Candidates will be mailed the exam results once they have been processed.Each state within the United States has different requirements for state certification. Candidates unsure of their state's requirements should contact that state's health board., Once a candidate has passed the exam, he must reaffirm his commitment to the ARRT Rules and Regulations and the ARRT Standards of Ethics every year. He must also meet the continuing education requirements (outlined on the ARRT website) every two years., Xray technicians must meet the Continuing Qualifications Requirements (CQR) every 10 years.To meet the CQR, technicians must:


assemble and maintain a professional portfolio, detailing the technician's education, achievements, special skills, and professional developmentcomplete the self-assessment process, wherein the technician determines his own professional strengths and weaknesses to arrive at a list of "target" areas for improvement and further educationengage in continued education coursework in the areas targeted by the technician's self-assessment, There are many professional resources available to Xray technicians looking for employment. Members of the American Society of Radiologic Technologists (ASRT) can use the ASRT website to find career listings.Technologists who are not a part of ASRT can use the Health careers Network website to find job postings by category, location, or employer.
 Xray technicians are not doctors; rather, they must follow the physician's orders and obtain internal imaging. Technicians may then be expected to help evaluate those images in conversation with the physician.Typical duties of an Xray technician include:


adjusting, cleaning, and maintaining imaging equipmentpreparing patients for imaging proceduresprotecting the patient by preventing any unnecessary exposure to Xray imaging (usually with a lead apron)positioning both the patient and the imaging equipment, and operating the equipment to obtain an internal imageprocessing film used for internal imaging
maintaining the patient's records, and labeling images with the patient's information

, Xray technicians work primarily with Xray and computed tomography.However, some Xray technicians who have acquired experience in other types of radiologic technology may specialize in related fields, working with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment or mammography equipment.

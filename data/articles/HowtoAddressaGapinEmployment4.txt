 You may or may not feel you have to talk about your previous work experience. If you were out of the workforce for a long time, it might come up. In these situations, say only as much as you feel comfortable saying. Make sure to frame it in a positive light.If you feel you need to talk about it, make a friend that you trust.
Be honest, but reserved when asked about your employment gap if you feel it is a sensitive topic.
 If you've framed your period of unemployment in a certain way, make sure you stick to your story. After some time it may be possible to open up or give more details to co-workers once you've become friends, but until then, make sure your story isn't changing all the time.
 You have a new job now, and though you may feel some stress, guilt, or deficiency related to your gap in employment, remember you have a job now. You can let go of the past struggle for employment. Letting go of the past can help you deal with feelings you have related to this period.


Remember that your current achievement means more than past unemployment.
Treat yourself to something nice. This can help to remind you that you are gainfully employed, and that you deserve to let go.

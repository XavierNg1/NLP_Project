 Add 2 cups (473 ml) water to a medium pot. Heat the water over medium-high to high heat until it comes to a boil, which should take 5 to 7 minutes.Because you’re boiling it, tap water is fine for the repellent.
 Once the water comes to a boil, add 1 cup (96 g) of orange, lemon, lime, and/or tangerine peels to the pot. Lower the heat to medium, and allow the mixture to simmer for 20 minutes.Cat dislike citrus scents, so any combination of orange, lemon, lime, and/or tangerine peels that totals a cup (96 g) will work for the repellent.
If the mixture begins to boil again, lower the heat.
 After the mixture has simmered for 20 minutes, take the pot off the heat. Let the mixture cool completely, which should take approximately 30 minutes, before transferring it to a spray bottle.If the citrus peels are in large chunks, you can strain them out of the mixture so it’s easier to pour into the bottle.
 When the mixture is in the spray bottle, pour 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of lemon juice and a squirt or two of lemon-scented dish soap. Shake the bottle well to ensure that all of the ingredients are well combined.You can substitute lime or orange juice for the lemon, but be sure to use freshly squeezed juice.
You can use any type of clear dish soap, but a lemon-scented formula works best because cats don’t like the citrus scent.
 After you’ve thoroughly mixed the ingredients, spray the mixture in any area of your house that you want to keep cats out of. You can apply it to floors, walls, and even furniture.To be safe, it’s best to test the repellent on an inconspicuous spot on fabric-covered items to ensure that the ingredients won’t damage the material.

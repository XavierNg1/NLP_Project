 The four limbed staff pose engages your back, shoulders, and upper arms in a variation of the standing forward bend. Remember to keep your entire body in as straight a line as possible, allowing this pose to restore your back's natural length. Focus on elongating and stretching the entire core by using your abdominals and chest to hold yourself elevated. Keep breathing through your nose.
 This pose allows you to stretch and elongate every muscle in your body's core. You will push upwards with your chest, forming an arc through your legs. This posture strengthens your abdominals as well as your core, keeping your overall musculature engaged.
 Finish your workout off with this pose, which stretches your legs and arms out just as much as your abs. Because this pose requires balance and coordination, keep your fingertips in the prayer position as you lower yourself. Find your center of balance by pushing your fingertips together as hard as possible.

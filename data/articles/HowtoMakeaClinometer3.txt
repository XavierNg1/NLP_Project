 This type of protractor is shaped like half a circle, with angles marked all around the rim. You can buy them anywhere that sells school supplies. Ideally, choose a protractor with a small hole near the center of the protractor, along its straight base.


If you don't want to buy one, you can search online for a printable protractor. Print it out, cut it very carefully along its outline, and glue the paper protractor to something a little sturdier, such as construction paper or an index card.
 Tape a straight, plastic drinking straw on or near the straight edge of the protractor. Make sure the straw passes through the two 0ยบ or zero marks on opposite ends of the straight edge.


If you don't have a straw, roll a piece of paper into a tight cylinder and use that instead.
 Many protractors come with a small hole directly between the 0ยบ marks on the protractor, across from the 90ยบ mark on the curved edge of the protractor. If your protractor does not have a small hole here, or if the hole is not situated correctly, tape or glue the string to the protractor where the hole should be. Make sure the string dangles a few inches (several centimeters) below the protractor.


If you are using a paper protractor, you can punch the hole yourself with a sharp pen or hole punch. Do not try to punch a hole in a plastic protractor, as it is probably made from weak plastic and could shatter.
 Tie a paper clip, metal washer, or other small weight to the end of the string. When you hold the clinometer so the string falls past the circular rim of the protractor, the weight will pull the string straight down past an angle mark on the protractor, such as 60ยบ. This tells you what angle the clinometer is being held at, which can be used to find the heights of distant objects as described in the section below.

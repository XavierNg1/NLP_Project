 Each board is numbered from 1 - 20 in non-sequential order around the board. You play darts by throwing a small dart onto different parts of the board, counting your points as you go.;
, Each section has points associated with that section. If a dart lands in the outer green or red sections, the thrower scores double that section's number of points.


For example, if you land inside the double ring under 18, you would score 36 points.
 If a dart lands in the inner small green or red sections, the thrower scores triple that section's number of points.


If you land inside the triple ring under 18, for example, you would score 54 points.
 The bullseye is further split into two sections. The inner section (usually red) is called the "double bull" or "cork," and the outer section (usually green) is known as the "single bull" or just "bull."


If a dart lands in the green part of the bullseye, the thrower scores 25 points.






If a dart lands in the red part of the bullseye, the thrower scores 50 points.
 If a dart lands in a (usually) yellow or black section, the thrower scores that number of points.


Let's say you land an 18 in a single point area. You would receive exactly 18 points.

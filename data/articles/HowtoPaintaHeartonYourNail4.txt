 To create this manicure, you’ll need the following supplies: a top coat, a base coat, black nail polish, painter’s tape, a small paintbrush, nail polish remover and a hole puncher that creates a heart shape.Heart shaped hole punchers can be purchased online or in craft stores.
Make sure to remove any polish that is currently on your nails before beginning this manicure.
 File your nails into a shape that mimics the curve of your cuticles. Push your cuticles back and proceed to apply one coat of base coat. Allow the base coat to dry completely before applying two coats of the black nail polish.








Apply a coat of top coat over the nail polish to help seal the manicure.
Give nails an hour to dry before moving on to the next step. This will ensure you don’t have any smudges.
 Tear off a small piece of painter’s tape, roughly the size of your pinky. Punch a hole in the tape to create the heart shape, then place the tape on your left ring finger.








Position the heart so it is angled across the upper left hand corner of your finger.
Make sure the tape is lying completely flat against your nail.
 Dip the small brush into the nail polish remover and paint a coat of nail polish remover inside the heart. Use a paper towel to blot any extra nail polish remover and paint.








Paint from the edges of the tape inward to keep the lines of the heart looking sharp.
Peel the tape away, then repeat the last two steps on your right hand ring finger.
Paint on an additional coat of top coat and give the fingers up to an hour to dry.

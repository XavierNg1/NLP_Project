 When you disagree with him, gauge how he reacts. Reading his responses as “good” or “bad” is tricky, but generally, accept it as a good sign when he argues his own points with you. Take it to mean that he wants you to understand exactly where he stands so that you know exactly who you're with.No two people hold the exact same opinions, so be wary if he always agrees with you. If he does, consider it likely that he’s more interested in enjoying himself here and now than in building a long-term relationship, where knowing and resolving differences in opinion will really matter.
 He doesn’t have to agree with you in the end, but, at the very least, expect him to consider what you’re saying before responding. But if he always barrels on with his own opinions, as if you never said anything at all, he probably cares more about being “right” than about having a real exchange of ideas.
 Watch out for put-downs and insults. Judge how much he cares about you by his willingness to hurt you just because you disagree. If he calls you or your ideas “stupid” or anything like that, take that as a red flag.Also note the way he talks to you. Even if he doesn’t insult you outright, recognize when he’s still being dismissive and “talking down” to you.

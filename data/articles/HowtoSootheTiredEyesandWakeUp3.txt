 Producing a comfortable environment reduces tired eyes by allowing eyes strain to focus less. Harsh or excessive lighting requires more work for your eyes to adjust to. Long exposure to bright lights causes too much stimulation for our eyes and bodies, and will result in irritability as well as overall fatigue.
 Start by removing fluorescent light bulbs as well as additional light bulbs that may not be necessary to achieve suitable lighting. Change the bulbs to “soft/warm” varieties.
 Install dimmer switches on your lights. This allows you to control the level of lighting, which might help relieve symptoms.This also provides more light choices for other family members.
 Changes to your computer monitor may be necessary if you work for long periods of time. This will make it easier to focus your eyes. You will also strain your eyes less frequently.


Make sure your monitor is an adequate distance away. This is about 20-40 inches from your eyes. Keep your screen at eye level or slightly below eye level.Reduce glare by closing blinds, as sunlight may be distracting.
Adjust your monitor so the brightest light in the room shines at a 90° angle with your monitor.
Adjust your monitor’s brightness and contrast levels.
 Music as a whole usually puts people in better moods. Different types of music can "wake us up" in their own ways. Try dance music. Dance music can allow you to imagine yourself dancing and enjoying yourself. As a result, you might unconsciously move to the rhythm by tapping your feet, snapping your fingers or working to the beat.
Listen to familiar music. Soothe tired eyes by closing your eyes for a few minutes and listening to music that is familiar. This can evoke pleasant memories.
Listen to upbeat music. Increasing mental awareness as well upbeat music with motivational lyrics can simply make you happier.
Turn up the music. Increasing the volume slightly above your usual setting can stimulate senses to be alert.

 This is assuming that you've already created both an account and a Lord character.;
, If you are a new character or have recently moved to the Wilderness, the blue Move button is quite large. Otherwise it is in the upper center strip of buttons on your settlement page.
 This is at the bottom of the Relocate window that appears. The button reads "Found a New Settlement"

, You can name yours whatever you want, from Holy Rome to Doomopolis.
 Take your first actions as the sovereign of your new settlement.
 To do this, hit the Population tab in the box on the right side of your screen. As you can see, Altaron has 10 Peers, 50 Yeomen, and 100 Peasants with room for 100 more. But this isn't nearly enough for a flourishing community.
 You've got two routes for that from your settlement page. Either click on the Fields in your map or click the Fields icon and then the green Go to District button in the right hand box.
 Latifundia is your first important population building and the first way you have to get more precious Peers for your work force. Select the 'Blueprint' tab. Inside the Blueprints menu, select Exclusive Building from the upper buttons. The Latifundia info will appear in the right hand box behind the windows. Select Construct Now. All new Sovereigns have enough Produce to build at least Latifundia at the start.
 During the 16 minutes your Latifundia will take, you can check out other aspects of the game. What actions do you have available? What do you need to build a new district? What's in my storage? Where can you get Heroes to pledge fealty to your glorious person?

, You'll soon realize how important population is to work your farms and future buildings. Farms only takes two minutes to build and they will probably become a central production source for your settlement.

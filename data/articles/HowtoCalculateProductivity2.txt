 The GDP measures a nation's total economic activity in terms of the goods and services produced.You'll need that number to calculate productivity based on GDP.


Fortunately, the GDP is a figure that's already calculated for you and delivered by one of the country's agencies.
The GDP for many countries is available online. Google the country's name plus "GDP". You can also find the GDP of many countries at the World Bank website.Find the GDP figure for the time period that you're measuring (e.g., for a quarter or a year).
If the quarterly GDP figure is released as an annualized number (as is the case in the United States), divide it by four if you want a quarterly measurement.
 To calculate worker productivity, you'll need to find the number of people who are employed in the country.


In the United States, you can find the key statistics on the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).For other countries, you'll have to Google around.
 Just divide the GDP by the total number of people employed. The result will give you the labor productivity for that country.

For example, if the country's GDP is $100 billion and the total number of people employed is 100 million, then the worker productivity is 100 billion / 100 million or 1,000 units of output produced per person employed.
 Worker productivity can be used to estimate how much an increase in population or employment can affect GDP. Multiply worker productivity by the increase in the number of workers to estimate how much GDP will be affected by the new workers.

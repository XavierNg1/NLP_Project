 Do this by double-clicking the orange “O” icon on your desktop or programs list.
 Outlook will open into your Inbox by default. Here you can see a list of all your emails. Select one; this will open the Compose Reply window.
 This is found at the top of the window.
 Click on “Bullets” from the toolbar, and you should then see a bullet point on the area where you type in your message.
 Just type in whatever message you want to be under that bullet.


Hitting “Enter” will create a new line with the bullet you have selected from the Bullets menu.

 When used correctly, coupons can save you more than just purchasing the item as is, and even move than that if the item is on sale or when the coupon can be doubled in savings. Even if it's a few cents off, it's a few cents that can be used towards something else.


A great substitution for coupons is to use a weekly grocery circular or ad. When you are a regular shopper at a specific supermarket, you can easily identify what's really on sale or a typical price in an ad, although there might be holiday slashes on certain items throughout the year that could be a great hidden bargain.;
, Meats, such as ground beef or chicken are usually marked down by the butcher around the use by/sell by date. If you're needing a last minute dinner, it's recommended to go with that. Bread that are days old can easily be turned into French toast or croutons.

 Store unit prices are essentially how much a measurement (such as each ounce or liter) costs. For example, if a 12 ounce cereal box costs $3.00 and a 16 ounce cereal box costs $3.00, you would get the 16 ounce box because each ounce costs $0.18, rather than paying $0.25 for the 12 ounce box.
 Produce are excellent choices in desserts and other baked items, such as banana bread, smoothies, and ingredient substitutions. Bananas and applesauce are great replacements for eggs when baking cookies or a cake.

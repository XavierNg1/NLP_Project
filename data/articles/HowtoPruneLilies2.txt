 Ginger Lilies are hardy in zones 7-10 and need be pruned differently to other lilies. These plants spread very quickly, so pruning them back and deadheading is an important way of controlling the spread of this plant in your garden.


Cut off the old growth and dig up any new growth that emerges in the spring if you want to contain the spread.
 In spring, cut back any damaged stalks, along with the remainder of any stalks that flowered the previous year. Remove any brown or yellow growth.


Ginger lilies can be deadheaded to prevent the plant reseeding itself, but this does nothing to promote continuous flower production.
If you want to prevent the spread of new growth, you will have to dig up the plant from the bulb each spring.
 Ginger lilies use their foliage to protect themselves over the winter months. If you prefer to remove it for aesthetic reasons, itâ€™s okay to cut foliage back in the fall to a few inches above the ground.


However, it's especially important to mulch the soil over the plant thickly before winter sets in, in order to replace the protection of the foliage.

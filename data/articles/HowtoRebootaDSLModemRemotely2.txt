 You can also reboot your router remotely with what is called a “remote power switch.” These are devices that attach to your computer and automatically control functions over a network like power and internet access and can reboot cable modems, DSL, and routers. Models like iBoot can be purchased at computer stores or online and generally cost around $200., Remote power switches are made to hook directly to your principal PC. Plug the computer's power cable as well as its internet cables into the device. Hooking up your computer will allow you to control certain functions on all other computers on your network, remotely, and to even automate these functions., Once you have hooked up your computer, set up the remote power switch so that it automatically monitors internet connectivity and will reboot the router in case of a failure. You should be able to do this by accessing the device settings on your desktop. You can also schedule it to reboot regularly, every morning or every other morning, for example., Remote power switches work automatically once you set them up. If your router is giving you problems, the device will automatically detect it and reboot the router, leaving you with fewer worries.
 As before, once the router has rebooted it will take some time for it to regain its usual functionality. You should be able to access the internet again in several minutes.

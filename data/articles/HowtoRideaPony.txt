 Naturally, tack that fits a full-sized horse won't fit a pony, and riding in ill-fitting tack can be uncomfortable and even dangerous for both you and your pony. Some pony's tack will be made for children to use (often the stirrups will be the length used for a child).;
, You could also ask them to give you a leg-up., Special care must be taken to ride with a gentle seat and hands while riding ponies due to their small size, but firmness is required at points to convince them that you are the one riding.If you do not tell them where to go they will not know and may decide to not listen or buck/rear etc.
 Because ponies' legs are shorter, they take shorter strides, which are consequently more rapid. This can sometimes make their gaits feel more bumpy or even jarring. If you're used to riding horses, take time to get used to ponies' movement, and progress through the gaits slowly. Be careful when seeing a distance while jumping not to judge with a horse's stride in mind instead of a pony's. Make sure you are rising to the trot to a pony's stride, not a horse's

, As horses and ponies naturally wish to stay together in a herd, a pony may find it frustrating to be unable to keep up with the horses. Ask the riders of horses to slow down for you, or ride at a faster gait to keep up. Allow horses to pass you if they need to move quickly.
 To make sure you don't do this use your legs to push your pony over. The reason this works is the pony will want to move away from the pressure.

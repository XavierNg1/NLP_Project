 You can use nearly any type of paint to paint laminate furniture, but latex-based interior paints are ideal.









Apply the paint as you did the primer, using long, smooth strokes. Use a combination of a paint roller and a brush: hit the long even surfaces with your roller, and hit the edges and corners with a brush.
 Wait a day between coats, spot-sanding areas with bubbles as needed. Multiple thin coats will always provide a better finish than a single thick coat.
 When the paint has dried thoroughly (at least one full day), you can put the pieces of the furniture back together.









Again, be slow and deliberate when reassembling the furniture: particle board, especially screw and cam holes, have a way of crumbling if treated at all harshly or forcibly.
With a small brush, touch up any areas where the paint gets scratched.
For best results, you may want to allow to paint to set up for a few days before subjecting the furniture to use.

 Gather parsley before the first flowers start to open, and gather it in the morning after the dew has dried. It will have maximum flavor at this time of day; the heat of the afternoon will diminish the parsley's flavor. Alternately, purchase fresh parsley at a grocery store. Choose bright green bunches of parsley that look nice and smell fresh. Don't pick parsley that is shriveled, brown, moldy, or is dried out. Carefully cut the parsley with stems still attached, and be careful to not bruise the leaves.
 Use cold water to rinse, and then shake the parsley gently to remove excess water from the leaves. This will remove any residual dirt, as well as any bugs that crawled into your parsley.
 Place a paper towel on a plate and place a single layer of parsley leaves on it. Then cover the leaves with another paper towel.
 Watch them constantly to ensure that they do not burn. If the parsley is not fully dry, gently toss the parsley leaves to ensure it is drying evenly. Microwave the leaves for another 30 seconds.


Times may vary depending on the model of your microwave. Follow the instructions for your microwave.

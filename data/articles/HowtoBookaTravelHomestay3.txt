 Booking a travel homestay means you will be sleeping in the home or on the property of someone who lives in your travel destination. You might have little personal space, and will be asked to abide by the rules of the household. You might even be expected to help with cooking and cleaning tasks, depending on your arrangement., Before you book your travel homestay, you will need to make sure you read the fine print. Read every word of all contracts. Pay specific attention to what your recourse is should you become unhappy with your homestay. If this information is not included, ask your host or agency to amend the contract and include it., If possible, you should not pay the full balance of your travel homestay before arriving at your destination. This is especially important if you have not seen current photos of the dwelling or read recent reviews. Ask your host for an arrangement that allows you to pay a deposit ahead of time, and then pay the balance upon your arrival.
 When you book a travel homestay, you should make sure that safety is a priority. For example, if you are a single woman, you should avoid homestays where you will be staying alone with a male host. You should also take the location and its safety into consideration. For example, you should not book a travel homestay that is too far away from public transportation or forms of communication such as telephone or Internet service., Whether you are in the booking process, or have already arrived at your travel homestay, you must always follow your instincts. If your gut is telling you a situation is unsafe, or a homestay seems too good to be true, it probably is. Remove yourself from the situation immediately if your instincts tell you that you should.

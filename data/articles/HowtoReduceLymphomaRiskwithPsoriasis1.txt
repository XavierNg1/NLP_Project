 HL typically presents as one or more enlarged lymph nodes. These may occur anywhere in the body, such as in the neck, above the collarbone, in the armpit, or in the groin.


Enlarged lymph nodes may also occur for other reasons, such as an infection, so it does not necessarily mean that there is cancer present.
However, if the enlarged lymph node persists, or you notice it continuing to grow, especially if it is hard, fixed, and immobile, seek professional medical evaluation immediately.;
, It is key to look out for for signs and symptoms that may be suspicious of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) – MF type.The MF (Mycosis fungoides) subtype of CTCL typically presents as reddish bumps on the skin. These may have a variety of appearances, from flat, to patch-like, to scaly (resembling psoriasis), to nodular.
 It is also important to watch for signs and symptoms that may be worrisome for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) – Sezary type.The Sezary type of CTCL is the more severe version (a step up from the Mycosis fungoides type). It is also known as the "red man syndrome," because the entire skin becomes like one great big red lesion. It is very severe and warrants immediate medical attention.
 If you are experiencing any of the above (called "B-symptoms"), they are "red flag" symptoms for a possible cancer and warrant immediate medical attention.

 The cherries should be ripe but not overripe and in excellent condition without blemishes.


Dark cherries are best for freezing if you want them to retain their sweetness.;
, Tip the cherries into a colander. Wash under running water, hand picking out any debris that you can see.


Use cold water only for rinsing.
Decide now whether you want to pit and de-stem the cherries or not.
 Let dry before proceeding. Place on absorbent paper to wick away the moisture. Gently pat dry with a paper towel.
 If adding to a resealable freezer bag, pack as tightly as possible and try to gently expel excess air without squashing the cherries. If adding to a freezer-proof container with lid, add as many cherries as possible before putting the lid on.
 Let freeze. Leave space around the bag (if using one) to allow for expansion while freezing.
 Use as many or as few of the cherries as needed each time; simply pull away the amount you want. Return the rest of the cherries to the freezer before they start to thaw.
 For baking and other recipes, you will likely also need to remove the pit.

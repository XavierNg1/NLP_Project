 Chop the herbs finely. Or use dried herbal mixes to taste.
Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the garlic butter. This provides a more intense, cheesy flavor.
Use half butter/half olive oil in the second method above for a better toast-like result.
Try sprinkling on onion powder or chili powder for a new twist.
Sprinkle freshly cracked pepper over the top of the garlic butter or oil mix.
 Spread the olive oil and garlic mixture on bread, then top the slices with chopped onion and tomato. Add a few shavings of Parmesan cheese if desired.

, Cut a clove of garlic just in half, and grate over the toast. Then cut in half a tomato and grate over the toast. Cover with olive oil and some sea salt and pepper. Great to eat natural or with a piece of cheese or tomato!

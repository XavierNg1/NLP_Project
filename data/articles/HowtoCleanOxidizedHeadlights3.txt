 Fill a bucket with water. Add a moderate amount of dish soap to it. Stir the solution to evenly distribute the soap. Dip a microfiber cloth into the solution and wipe away grime and buildup on the headlight. When clean, dry the light with a separate microfiber cloth., Put 3 tbsp (44.4 ml) of baking soda into a cup. Add water little by little to the cup. Stir the mixture with your clean hands or a spoon as you do so. When it becomes a thick paste, stop adding water. Blend the mixture so it is consistent throughout., Wet your sponge in clean water. Use the sponge to moisten the clean light. Dip part of your sponge into the paste and evenly dab a generous amount across the entire light. You should have enough paste to clean all headlights and taillights., Rub the paste into the light with your sponge using circular motions. Use firm, moderate pressure while moving back and forth over the light with the sponge. When all surfaces have been buffed, rinse the light with water, reapply the paste, and buff it again. Keep the light wet at all times while buffing.Depending on the severity of the oxidation on the light, it may take many applications before all cloudiness and discoloration is removed. You should see results after about two or three applications.
Baking soda is a milder cleaning agent, so it isn’t likely to damage your paint job. However, it is mildly abrasive, so you should try to avoid getting it on the paint surrounding the light.
 When you finish a light, turn it on to make sure you haven’t missed any spots. Repeat the cleaning process to remove missed spots. In the same fashion as the first light, remove oxidation from your remaining exterior lights, including your taillights.

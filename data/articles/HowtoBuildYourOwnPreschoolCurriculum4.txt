 An online website for you to plan books and curriculums is ideal. Or, you could type this curriculum on you computer using Microsoft Word or any other typing place you may have.
 Label each page by days. There should be 180 days or more, because 180 days is how long school last normally. If you live in a country that uses a different number of days in the school year, use this number instead.
 Be sure to use correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Be sure to include lots of details, to make each step as clear as possible.


Another way to be sure that your curriculum is clear is to add pictures of the activities and snacks, crafts, and games.
 Hire a writer if you are not the best writer and hire an artist to draw pictures for you. Always hire an editor to catch any mistakes and make your curriculum better.



Talk to your editor or artist and ask them about printing the book in color. Color is appealing to the eye and may make drawings more clear.

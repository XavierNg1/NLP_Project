While you may be able to accomplish the task of grating ginger with a standard box grater, you will likely find that clean-up can be a hassle. Many people who use standard graters report that the ginger becomes stuck within the perforations. Think about investing in a grater specifically designed to handle ginger gratings. Porcelain ginger graters can be purchased, along with microplane graters that are designed to be used with ginger.;

You can grate the entire piece of ginger if you want to, but for most dishes, you'll only need a small piece of the ginger root to adequately season a meal. If you only need to grate a small piece of ginger, cut off a portion from rest of the root.










Use a knife or the back of a spoon to dislodge the woody peel from the ginger. Though it can be tempting to peel the ginger like a potato, by moving the knife towards you, it isn't advisable to do this. In addition to being dangerous, you can also take off more peel than is necessary. Your goal should be to peel off just enough outer layer to expose the edible ginger underneath.
 Make sure that the ginger is traveling against the grater's grain. Allow the gratings to fall into the container.

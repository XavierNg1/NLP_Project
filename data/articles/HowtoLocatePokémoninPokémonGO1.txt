 You should see a gray rectangle in the bottom left hand corner of your home/map screen. This gray rectangle is your nearby tracking box. This box will help you find Pokémon that are close to you.;
, It will show you up to 9 Pokémon that are relatively close to you. If you have seen or captured the Pokémon before, it will show up as a picture of the actual Pokémon. If you have never seen or captured a Pokémon before, it will show up as a silhouette.
 If a Pokémon has no footprints underneath it, it is extremely close to you, probably within catching distance. If a Pokémon has one footprint underneath it, it’s relatively close to you. Two footprints means it’s farther, and three footprints means it’s even farther.


Once you’ve clicked on the nearby tracking box in the home screen, you will have brought up the nearby tracking box. This will show up to 9 Pokémon. If you click the “X” and minimize it again, it will show three nearby Pokémon in its minimized mode.
However, if you want to track one particular Pokémon, open the nearby tracking box and tap the Pokémon you want to track. The Pokémon will then be the only one that appears in the minimized gray box on the home screen. This way, you can tell if you’re getting closer or farther from this particular Pokémon.
The Pokémon in the top left corner is the closest to you, and the Pokémon in the bottom right corner is farthest from you (even if they all have three footprints)., Walk for a little bit in one direction. Open the nearby tracking box. See if you got closer to any particular Pokémon. If so, keep walking in that direction. If not, try a different direction.


Pokémon GO’s nearby tracking box will not tell you which direction you should take to find the most Pokémon. You need to do some trial and error to see if you are moving closer to farther from the Pokémon.
 When you’ve gotten really close to a wild Pokémon, you will be able to see if in your map screen. Tap it to begin the process of catching it.

 You're dealing with metal and if it is placed under stress and a part of it flings eye-ward, you risk losing an eye. It is recommended that you wear eye protection (goggles or safety glasses) and also gloves when manipulating and drilling the cutlery.
 The tools needed are basic:


Bending the cutlery: In some cases, you'll be able to bend the cutlery with your own strength. In other cases, you'll need the help of another item to apply pressure. Items that might help you complete the projects include: a vise and rubber mallet or hammer; piers, channel locks, or a vice grips; an anvil; fishing wire; and screws.
The drill: The drill and bit should be suitable for drilling through metal––some drill bits are designed specifically to do this or are combination bits for both wood and metal. Ask to borrow one from a friend if you don't have one already.
Wire cutters: In some cases, these may come in handy.
Vice grips: This might be handy to help hold the cutlery piece in place for bending.
Screws: For attaching to the wall, wood or other object used.
Liquid nails (industrial strength glue): If you don't want to deal with drilling holes, try liquid nails. This might be strong enough to attach the cutlery hooks to a variety of surfaces––be sure to check the product instructions first.

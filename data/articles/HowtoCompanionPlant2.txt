 Fill planter trays with all-purpose compost, mist the compost with water, then drop seeds from your companion plants onto the surface. Add another layer of compost on top and cover the trays with cling wrap, polythene, or a piece of glass to keep them moist and warm. Monitor the trays daily until seedlings emerge., Before planting your companion plant seedlings in the garden, plan where to position them for optimal growth. Plant tall plants in front of low, sun-sensitive plants to block them from the sunlight. Plant pest-repellent plants next to other plants that are frequently ravaged by such pests (e.g. planting garlic nears roses to ward off rose pests)., Dig holes large enough to accommodate the seedlings and rake a handful of compost into the base of the holes. Gently push the seedlings out of their trays from the bottom, leaving as much compost around the root as possible. Insert them into the holes and fill the space around them with an even mixture of soil and compost., Observe how your companion plants grow together and how they complement each other. Record your companion plant combinations in a journal and note how well they grew together. Keep track of how long it took for your plants to grow, what yields you had, and how long the crops lasted during their growth season.

 You'll need to defeat the Elite Four and enter the Hall of Fame before you'll be able to catch a Gible. This essentially means you'll need to beat the game before you can find one., The only way to get a Gible, Gabite, or Garchomp in HeartGold or SoulSilver is to catch a Gible from the Safari Zone and then evolve it., You'll need to place 52 Plains and 68 Peaks objects in order to make Gible available in the Rocky Beach area. This means you'll need to upgrade the blocks you place quite a bit, since the area has a 30 item limit. You can upgrade the blocks by using the Safari Zone a lot., Once your Rocky Beach area is properly configured, you can encounter a Gible by walking around. It may take several battles for it to appear. Throw mud and then a Safari Ball to try to capture it., Since the Gible you catch in the Safari Zone is Level 44, it will attempt to evolve into Gabite after gaining a single level.

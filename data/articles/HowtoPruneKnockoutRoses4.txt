 Ideally, you should prune at the end of summer or the very early beginning of fall, when the weather is still warm but starting to get a little chilly.


There may still be some active growth on the knockout roses, but you should notice the growth beginning to taper off at this point., Just like in the summer, you also need to give your knockout roses a final trim to remove any potentially damaging parts of the plant. Otherwise, disease could spread throughout the knockout rose bush as a whole, destroying it by the time winter sets in.


Diseased parts of the plant should be removed immediately to prevent the disease from spreading. Similarly, dead and damaged wood is an invitation for fungi and bacteria to attack the plant, making it vulnerable, so these elements should also be removed as soon as possible.
 Fall pruning is not a major ordeal, and many gardeners can get away with skipping it. In general, though, the idea is to tidy your plant up by removing long growth that does not belong and by trimming off a portion of the height.


You can prune up to one-third of the height of your plant, depending on how vigorous your plant grew during the growing season.
If it just barely reached your ideal height, a smaller trim would be better. If it exceeded that height, the full one-third might be preferable for you.
You should also fertilize the plants immediately after this last pruning.
If there are any long stems sticking out from the top or from the side, trim these, as well.

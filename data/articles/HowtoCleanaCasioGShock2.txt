 If you wear your watch regularly, you likely have a few scuffs and markings from regular wear. A handy tool that you can use to remove scuffs is a regular pencil eraser. To use an eraser, rub it gently on the scuff several times, then wipe away the eraser dust.Use a white eraser as opposed to a pink eraser to avoid discoloring the watch, especially if the watch is white.
Scuffs are not to be confused with scratches. Scuffs are superficial skid marks on the surface of the watch, whereas scratches penetrate the surface of the watch.
 Toothpaste is an unlikely but highly effective tool for removing scuffs and light scratches. To use toothpaste, dab a small amount on the end of a Q-tip and rub the scuffs or scratches gently in circular motions. After wiping, use a slightly damp soft cloth to rub away the toothpaste.Use a standard white toothpaste as opposed to a gel-based or non-white toothpaste.
 A jeweler’s cloth is especially formulated to remove minor scratches from the surface of a watch or piece of jewelry. To use the jeweler’s cloth, rub the light scratches with the cloth for about 30 seconds. You should see that the scratches have gone.If you have particularly large or deep scratches on the surface of your watch, you may need to bring your watch to a professional jeweler to get them removed.

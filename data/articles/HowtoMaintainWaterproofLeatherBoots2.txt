 Insoles should be allowed to dry separately from the boot to prevent the growth of mold, bacteria, or other damage.
 Allow them to air dry at room temperature. Do not place them near a radiator, on a sunny windowsill, or in the path of some other heat source as doing so weakens the adhesives used in footwear and turns the leather brittle.
 The tongue should be propped open, and the fan should still blow room temperature air on the boots.
 Newspaper helps absorb the moisture, drying your boots faster.
 After an hour, the paper may have absorbed too much moisture to remain effective.

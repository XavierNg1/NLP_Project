 In order to use torrent files, you will need to install a torrent client. Download and install uTorrent, a free BitTorrent client, if you don’t already have it.


Other torrent clients include Vuze and BitTorrent.
 Search the internet for a Mac Torrent file to download. You will likely find many possible links, so you will need to ensure that you are downloading a good file.


Look at the Seeders (S) and Leechers (L) count to see how good the connection is. More seeders means a faster connection and also increases the chance that the torrent is clean.
Read the comments for the torrent you are downloading to ensure that other users were able to get it working OK and that they did not encounter any viruses.
Mac operating systems are less susceptible to viruses than Windows operating systems are, but you are still not protected from everything. Torrent files are one of the most popular way to spread viruses, so be careful.
Do not click on the ads that offer to speed up your downloading time. Download speed will depend mostly on your internet connection and the number of torrent seeders.
 Make sure to click on the correct button when downloading the link: it will usually read “Download Torrent” right under the filename. Depending on your internet connection and the number of seeders, this process could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.


For more detailed information on using torrent files, see this guide.
 After you download the torrent file, it will be delivered as a DMG file to your computer. Run the installation, and enjoy using Microsoft Word on your Mac!


You may need to install a crack as well. Read the README file included in the download to see what extra steps you might need to follow in order to get Word running.

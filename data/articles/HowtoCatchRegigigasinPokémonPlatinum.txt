 It helps if you keep along a Master Ball. If you need to, try using the infinite Pokeball cheat.;
,,, That is crucial!

, You may think that max repels will help, but Regigigas is Level 70, so you might want to train a little bit before you face him.
 Arceus holding a fist plate will be your best bet as Regigigas is a normal type, so he'll be weak to fighting types. regular Fighting type Pok√©mon help too.
 You will need to slide around a bit until you get to the middle. When you go up to Regigigas, if you haven't got the other 3, when you press a it will say a body of rock ice and steel. If you have got the other three, it will still say that and then you can catch him.He has Hyper Beam,so watch out.

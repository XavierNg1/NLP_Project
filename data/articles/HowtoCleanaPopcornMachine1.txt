While many machines can cool in as little as an hour, it may be advisable to let the machine sit for a few hours or overnight to allow it to cool completely.;
, Wash the cover, the butter melter cup, and any other removable components with dish soap or a mild detergent and warm water. Unless the manufacturerâ€™s manual specifically states the components are dishwasher safe, wash all components by hand.Do not wash any electrical or non-removable components with water, as this could cause damage to the maker.
Use a sponge or washcloth to wash the removable components. Do not use steel wool or other scouring instruments.

 If the chute is not removable, use a damp cloth to wipe it down. Avoid rinsing inside the popping chamber, as this could cause problems with the electrical equipment.Clean out debris from the popping chamber by using a dry cleaning cloth such as a microfiber cloth or fleece cleaner.

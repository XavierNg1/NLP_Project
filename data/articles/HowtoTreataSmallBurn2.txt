 After you've gotten the swelling and the pain under control, clean the burn with some mild soap and water. Dry the area and keep the burn clean to avoid infection.
 To help keep the swelling down and the burn as clean as possible, it's a good idea to use a basic salve or balm that you can get at the store. Aloe-vera gel or cream is often used, as well as low-dosage hydrocortisone.


If you have blisters, use an antibiotic topical cream and cover the blister with a bandage for about 10 hours before you uncover it.
Gentle, scent-free moisturizer is sometimes used on mild burns. This helps keep the skin on the burned area from cracking. Let the burn heal some before you apply moisturizer.
 Very mild burns don't need to be covered to help them heal. Keep the burn clean and dry, and it should heal in a few days.


Blistered burns should generally be covered loosely with gauze. If you're in pain, you can use some loosely-wrapped gauze or a Band-Aid to cover the burned area and keep it safe.
 Never attempt to pop blisters when they form. The blister is protecting the burned area and helping to heal the skin underneath. Blisters will go down in a few days, provided that you keep the area clean and dry.


Larger blisters should be checked out by a doctor, who will often lance or remove the blisters, if necessary. Never attempt to do this by yourself.
 To keep the burn from becoming irritated, try to keep the area open and dry. Wear loose fitting cotton clothes that breathe well and let the air get to the burn.


If you've burned a finger or hand, remove any rings, bracelets, and watches from the area, and wear short sleeves. You don't want to agitate the area at all, if possible.
 If your burns are hurting, taking a pain reliever like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. This can help to reduce swelling as well as control the pain. Use OTC pain medications as directed.

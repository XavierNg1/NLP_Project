 They want to protect you from being noticed by the wrong people's eyes.;
, Steer your parents into reasonable discussions. Discussions are far preferable to battles, especially those in which you can get your parents on your side in solving a complex need or social problem. For girls, mom can be a big supporter here or a big roadblock.
 Honest communication about what you want trumps sneaking around in spades. You may get what you want in the short run by going around your parents' back, but in the long run you will hurt the relationship.
 Tankinis and halters are perfect for hot weather, at the beach, visiting at a friends house and when lying out. Getting approval for them as Mall wear when you are 11 or 12 is asking for trouble. On any new wardrobe that you think might be "pushing it a little" let them get used to seeing you in it in secure situations before asking for more. This is a world in which bad things can happen, they do want to protect you and frankly, they are not ready to become grandparents yet. These are very, very strong motivations to keep you dressed like an Amish girl if they could.
 Situations are important, it depends where you wear clothes. If you are just wearing these items to your friends house, then tell them that the only person who will see you will be your friend.
 If you want to wear a tankini at the beach or at a pool, they might be happier if you wore surf shorts or boy shorts instead of bikini bottoms, or if you wore a sarong.
 Show her all the different kinds of tops and tankinis that you want to wear, and let her choose which one she would prefer you wearing! This will make mom a lot happier!

, Just as you know how to push all their buttons and make them upset, the reverse is true. Open communication is the only way to avoid knowing what the real obstacles to your goals are.
 Find out what's really at the heart of your parent's objections, then work on that.

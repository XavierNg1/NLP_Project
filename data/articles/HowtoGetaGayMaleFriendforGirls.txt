 Gay or straight, you must be kind and respectful to the other person to gain their trust and respect.;
, If you have some sort of expectation from someone because of their sexuality, you will be disappointed.
 Look around at work, at school... anywhere. If those outlets don't seem to work, grab some of your fabulous girlfriends and head to a gay bar for a night of dancing. After the dance, strike up a conversation and grab a cocktail. Introduce your friends to each other.
 Don't act desperate to be his friend. Be friendly, clever, attractive, and a real friend. If you want someone to be willing to listen to your troubles, you have to be there for him too.
 Get to know them as an individual and if you share interests, maybe you'll become friends.
 Television and movies are not accurate in how they portray gay men. For every male you meet that does match movie stereotypes, there are two that don't. Such is true for all media stereotypes. Don't talk about girly bodily functions or assume he wants to wear makeup or go shopping for fashionable clothes. It is not only a mistake, it's insulting.
 You cannot change him, convert him, or make out with him. Getting your heart involved is dangerous- you will get hurt and it's not fair when you know he's gay from the beginning.
 If you expect your friends to stick by you, they should still be your friends even when you're in a relationship and vice versa. If your boyfriend gets jealous of the time you spend with other friends, gay or straight, think about whether he's right for you. Do you really want someone that possessive?

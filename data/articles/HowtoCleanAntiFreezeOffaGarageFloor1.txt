 Kitty litter, sand, or baking soda all work and should be used to cover the spill as soon as it happens. These absorbent materials pick up the antifreeze before it settles., Paper towels or newspaper protect the material from being scattered and aid in absorption. Layer them over the kitty litter or other material. Add more layers if you wish to ensure that all of the spill will be absorbed.
 Come back after at least one hour in order to give the material time to absorb the spill. Limit your time away to about three hours maximum so you can check the antifreeze again before it sets into the floor.
 Use dry paper towels to pick up the absorbent material and wipe up any leftover fluid. While small skin exposure to antifreeze isnâ€™t much of a threat, wash your hands with soap and water or wear gloves to be safe.
 A simple laundry or dish detergent will work for cleaning the floor. Powdered detergent is useful for setting stains, but if there is no stain yet, liquid soap can be used on the area. Let it set in for a minute., Spread water from a hose over the area. Use a nylon brush to scrub the spot. Rinse the suds away completely., Open the garage door and allow the area to dry in open air. This may take a few hours depending on the size of the spill, but will help remove the smell. If you cannot do this, layer newspaper over it. Newspaper will pick up the moisture when left for at least an hour. Paper towels can also be used to wipe off any leftover moisture.

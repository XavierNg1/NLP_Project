 While you may get the job you interviewed for, you never know until you get the call. Plus, it may take the company a little while to get back to you. Meanwhile, you shouldn't be wasting time sitting around. Keep applying for jobs and making contacts.It may take a while to hear back, depending on the job. For instance, some companies may take up to a month to get back to candidates. It's fine to ask at the interview how long you can expect to wait to hear back, so you have a good idea.
 Try to get the recommended 8 hours of sleep. When you're not getting enough sleep, it makes you more stressed.Stick to a sleep schedule, even on the weekends. If you can't remember to go to bed on time, try setting an alarm on your phone an hour before you want to go to sleep. At the point, shut down all electronics and get ready to head for bed.
 Once you've figured out if anything went wrong and how you can correct it, spend your time thinking about what went well, if you must think about the interview. Think about how well you did answering a particular question, and remind yourself that you remembered to ask a couple of questions. Staying focused on the positive will help keep you upbeat., Hobbies are a great way to de-stress because you can lose yourself in what you're doing, much like meditation. Pick a hobby you love to do, and spend a couple of hours doing it the week after the interview.Even better, visit a local group that was created around the same hobby. That way, you engage with others and enjoy your hobby.
 Volunteering is a way to help others, but it also builds up your skill set at the same time. Plus, it makes you feel better about yourself and gives you a chance to meet new people and network.Try volunteering at a local library or school. Visit hospitals, soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and other similar organizations to see if you can help. Spearhead a community garden. Try to pick something that partially uses the skills you have.

 Worship God, sing and pray. Don't just go to Church but really take to heart the message of salvation that Jesus offered you. Remind yourself that you have been forgiven because he chose to die on the cross for all of our sins. Also, remember the message of the virgin Mary and Christ's miraculous birth. Keep in mind that the word "Christmas" comes from the words "Christ's Mass,"meeting as a congregation. Attend Mass, or the services at church.;
, Don't eliminate them altogether, but make them special -- consider keeping them simple and giving no more than three per child from the parents. Jesus received three gifts from the three wise men: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. We can keep our gift-giving less materialistic and more symbolic of what occurred on the first Christmas.Â 

,, Much like the Easter bunny, Easter eggs, and even the word "Easter" itself -- Santa Claus, elves and decorating a tree is another adopted Christian tradition that was originally pagan (not about Christ).
 Thank God for bringing your family together on this occasion, for the food, and for all the blessing's you've received and health and family.
 Smile, laugh and have some special visits with neighbors, relatives, grandparents, uncles and aunts, cousins,...

Being too uptight about keeping "cultural Christmas" out of your children's worlds, when it is so widespread in our culture, may make them resent living a strict and formal Holiday life if they feel excluded from their peers' fun.
 Read a Biblical account of Christmas to the family after all the festivities are over (chapters 1 and 2 of Matthew is a good place to start). It will be a closing word to explain the actual meaning behind the celebration that happens on Christmas.

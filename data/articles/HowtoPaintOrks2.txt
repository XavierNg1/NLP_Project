 Apply it liberally to the skin of the model.
 The paint should be the consistency of melted butter.
 Apply to the arms and face liberally, but don't paint in the reassesses of the orks arm, or face. The darkness in reassesses adds depth to the model.
 Make sure to leave an outline of the last coat so the green blends and transitions well.
 Apply to the very tops of muscle and curves in the orks skin. Tip: Paint the current mixture in a sinewy pattern to add a "rippling" effect to the orks skin. It requires a steady hand, but it's worth it.
 Apply to the very highest highlights, ie. on the edges of lips, eyebrows, and on the highlights of the muscles.

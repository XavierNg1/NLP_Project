 If you have something in mind, sketch it out on a piece of paper. Don’t be intimidated if you’re not particularly gifted in the art department; simply aim to get a rough draft on paper. If you don’t have any ideas, don’t fret. Jewelers can work with you to develop a custom piece that will be meaningful to you for years to come. Save photos of the jewelry that inspires you on your phone or print them out to bring with you. This will give the jeweler an idea of what you are looking for.
 Many jewelry stores offer custom design centers or studios to work with you on designing your perfect piece. You can find custom jewelers near you by conducting an online search with the phrase, “Custom jeweler in Detroit, MI.” Jot down some that look interesting to you on a piece of paper or your device’s notepad. Call or visit the stores to talk about their services.
 If you inherited an heirloom gem you would like to redesign or have a loose diamond or gemstone, bring them with you. Keep the precious items carefully tucked away in a small, locked jewelry box to avoid losing them before your appointment. You can work with the jeweler to incorporate these pieces into a brand-new, redesigned piece that will retain its sentimental value.
 Most jewelers will provide a wax or 3D-printed model for you to look and test out before the jewelry is created. This is the perfect time for you to provide feedback and let the jeweler know what you like, dislike, and want to change. Don’t be shy, this is a custom piece and you deserve to get exactly what you are envisioning.

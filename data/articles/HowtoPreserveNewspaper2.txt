 Light has an incredibly damaging effect on newspaper pages and the print that appears on them. Over time, prolonged exposure to light will cause a newspaper to become brittle and the content to fade.Keep your precious newspapers out of light (both natural and artificial) whenever possible. Donâ€™t store them in a bright rooms or leave them outside in the sun.
 Because newsprint has lots of acid, keeping pages pressed together encourages acid to spread and break down the wood pulp fibers. Contact with any acidic materials can cause extensive damage to the pages, so you need to protect them by inserting acid free paper between each page.Alkaline buffered tissue, available from conservation suppliers, is the best option for separating newspaper pages.
A cheaper alternative is acid-free tissue paper which, while not preventing the spread of acid between pages, does reduce the risk of increasing the acidity of the newspaper.
 For especially valuable newspapers, it may be advisable to contract the services of a professional conservator. Conservators can remove acid from newspapers and provide top-notch storage equipment; their services, however, will likely run into the hundreds of dollars. Lists of available conservators can be found at the website of the American Institute of Conservation.Additionally, there are products available for de-acidifying old documents, such as Archival Mist spray. However, unless your newspaper is very new, you should always consult a conservator before using such products, as you may unintentionally damage your newspaper in your effort to conserve it.

 To achieve tight ringlets, you will need to set your hair in small sponge rollers. The first row of rollers will go down the center of your head staring at the front of your scalp and ending at the nape of your neck.


Use a comb to section off a vertical segment of hair at the front of your scalp. This first section should be centered on your head. Do not make it longer than the curler itself or thicker than two finger widths. A section that is too long or too thick will not remain tightly curled.
Unclip your first roller.
Place the roller behind the section of hair. Slide the roller up the strand from the roots to the tips so that the hair is standing straight up.
Tuck the ends under the roller and proceed to twist it down towards your scalp.
Continue to section off your hair and set rollers down the center of your head until your reach the nape of your neck., Once you have completed the top section, you can set rollers on the right and left sides of your head. Work from the front to the center back of each side of your head. Section of the hair and set the rollers as you did for the top section—don’t forget to roll away from your head., Everyone’s curls will set at different rates. If you wet set your hair, leave the rollers in overnight and allow your hair to air dry.If you put rollers in your dry hair, you may opt to leave them in for anywhere from 15 minutes to 5 hours—your ringlets will become more defined the longer the rollers are left in your hair., After allowing your curls to set, remove the rollers one at a time. Comb your fingers through the ringlets to fluff and separate the curly strands. Finish your do with a spritz of hairspray or a small dollop of pomade.


Brushing or combing through your ringlets will cause them to snarl.

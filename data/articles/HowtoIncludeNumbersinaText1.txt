 For example, you would write out words like “five” or “fifty”, rather than using numerals.;
, When a number is a part of a measurement, such as “inches” or “years,” always use the number instead. For example:


“50 feet (15.2 m)” or “121 centiliters.”

, When a sentence would require you to use both numbers and words for numbers that are related, choose one or the other.


For instance, in the phrase “5 out of 2,400 agree” use numbers or words, don’t mix them.
 Use commas in large numbers. A comma goes every three digits to the left from the decimal point. When dealing with money, use numbers rather than numerals. If you are writing down a percent, or a date or address, you should also use numbers.


Use commas for large numbers, like 100,000,000.
Use numbers for money, such as “$4.50.”
Use numbers with percentages, like “73%”
For dates and addresses, use numbers like September 20, 2014, or 2489 29th Avenue.

 It should be long and thin enough to get through the sound hole without touching the strings.


A chopstick, small paintbrush, or pencil will work fine. Go with something you're comfortable with modifying. Don't select, for example, your favorite pen.
For the adhesive, you can use poster putty, double-sided tape, a bit of glue from a glue stick, or even chewing gum.
 The instrument should be facing up, with the strings and sound hold facing the ceiling. Position it so that you can see the pick through the sound hole. You might need to carefully shake it around until the pick comes into view.
 Touch it to the pick. Apply pressure so it sticks. Make sure you've got a grip on it before you start to pull it out of the guitar.
 Slow and steady wins the race: don't rush or you might drop the pick and have to start over. Be careful not to hit the strings or sound holeâ€™s sides, and try not to get the sticky stuff everywhere.


With practice, you might be able to skip the adhesive altogether, and use the stick to keep the pick anchored to the base of the guitar, against the inside label, as you flip the instrument over and let gravity do the rest.

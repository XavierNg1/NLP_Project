 While you can load the reel with line off the rod, you'll find it easier to have it mounted on the rod when you crank.


If you'll be using the reel on a longer rod of 6 feet (1.8 m) or more, and the rod is a 2-piece rod, you can leave the upper piece on the rod as long as the section with the reel seat has 1 or more guides. If your rod is a 1-piece rod, or if it's constructed so that the lower section doesn't have any guides, you'll need someone to hold the spool up.;
, Because a Microspin reel is an ultralight reel, you'll want to use line ranging from 2 to 8-pound test (1 to 4 kg class), depending on where you plan to fish.
 You'll want to have the line come off the spool in the same direction the bail assembly turns. If it turns clockwise, the line should feed off the line spool clockwise; if it turns counterclockwise, the line should feel off the line spool counterclockwise. This will prevent the line from twisting on the reel as you fill it.
, If there are no guides on the rod section your reel is attached to, skip this step.
 This gets it out of the way so you can access the reel spool.
 You can tie the line with an improved clinch, Palomar, or uni-knot, in other words, the same knot you use to tie a hook, swivel, or leader to the other end. Trim the tag end of the line as closely as you can without cutting your knot.
,, Maintain tension in the line by holding the line between your fingers or against the rod as you reel. This will prevent the line from coiling or knotting as it fills the reel.


Even if the rod or rod section has enough guides, you may find it helpful to have someone hold the line spool up to the same height as the reel. You can run a pencil or thin dowel through the hole in the center of the line spool to make it easier to hold in the correct position and for your assistant to maintain a light tension on the line spool with his or her fingers.

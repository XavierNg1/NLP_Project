 Avoid using soap, as it will flavor the sauce later. The purpose of washing is to remove dirt, leaves, etc from the fruit.
 Don't bother to peel or remove stems, cores, seeds etc. Your colander will handle all of that later and the peel not only contains many nutrients, but (if using red apples) also will add a nice color to your sauce that will be very different from that jar you just bought at the grocers. For now, just concentrate on cutting the apples into uniform chunks for steaming.
 This prevents the possibility of burning the apples instead of just steaming them. Some apples are juicier than others and you can skip the water... but you'll need to experiment with your variety of apple to know how much water to add to get the finished consistency you want.
,, The apples should readily "mush" when touched. If apples are rubbery at all, let them cook longer. Extra cooking will not hurt the apples, but under cooking them will make your colander (and possibly your arm) work harder.

 Whatever trick you are teaching your dog, always pick an area in your house that is free of distractions and quiet. A quiet, distraction-free area will help your dog focus on the task at hand.Pick a quiet room in your house that is away from children and other distracting toys/objects, smells, and sounds.
 Use cheese, hot dogs, or other treats that you know your dog cannot resist. Cut the treats up into small pieces to prevent your dog from becoming full while training it. It is harder to train a dog that is full of treats., If your dog is not familiar with the commands sit and say, then you might need to use a leash to hold it in place. If your dog becomes distracted or begins to wonder away, use the leash to redirect its attention.


Teach your dog the commands sit and stay before teaching it this trick.

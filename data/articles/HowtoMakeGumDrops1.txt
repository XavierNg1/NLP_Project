 To make square, sugar-cube shaped gumdrops, you can use a 9x5" bread pan. Line it with foil and spray with unflavored cooking spray, or give it a light coating of grape seed or peanut oil to prevent the candy from sticking.If you're making more than one gum drop flavor, prepare several small pans this way.


This recipe works as well with other types of pans; the only difference will be in the thickness of the finished candy. Use a larger pan for thinner gumdrops.
You can also use small molds to make gumdrops in different shapes.;
, Place the gelatin in a pot with the 1/2 cup cold water. Stir it with a spoon, then let it sit and soften while you prepare the remaining ingredients.
 In a separate pot, boil the 3/4 cup water. When it comes to a boil, add the sugar. Stir it in until the sugar dissolves. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes.
 Pour the hot sugar syrup into the pot with the gelatin. Place it over medium high heat and boil it for 15 minutes, stirring constantly.

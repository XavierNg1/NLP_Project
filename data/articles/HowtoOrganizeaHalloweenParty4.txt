 These can be your general orange, black and witch-y decorations, or you can go with a more specific theme. If your coworkers can get into it, go for it.


Design your workplace like the set of a movie. The staff can take a vote prior to Halloween. Then, on the actual day, members can dress up as characters.

Or certain sections of the work environment could be different movies. Then, you could pass around a bowl of movie titles and each person gets a movie title for the basis of their costume design. It could get turned into a contest or a guessing game on the day of.


A music theme works too...as long as you celebrate dead rockers of the past. For a twist on Halloween, choose this orientation, decorate your workspace like an abandoned music studio and get each of your peers into a dead but musical persona.
 Halloween doesn't have to be all about pumpkins, pretzels, and zombies. It can be old school and sophisticated, too. Have a murder mystery at work. This will take preparation in advance, but could be well worth it.


You'll have to write up a character outline for each guest, informing them how they knew "the deceased" and how they feel about other characters. Give one to each guest at the start of the game and reveal clues throughout the night, uncovering alibis, secrets, and interactions, etc. Before people start going home, have them all take a guess at the murderer (if they're the murderer, it should be indicated on their character outline). Of course, have the perp reveal themselves!, Unfortunately, there are no traditional foods or drinks that come with a Halloween party. Whatever your theme is, cater to that. Butterbeer, anyone?


Generally, finger foods are the way to go. Pumpkin cookies, lady fingers (can be decorated like a witch's finger), devil's egg eyeballs, and crab leg spiders are solid hits.

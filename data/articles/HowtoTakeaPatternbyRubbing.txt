 The paper should be of a good medium thickness. If it is too thick, it will not take a clear impression of the pattern, and if it is very thin, it is apt to tear. Paper used for letter writing or printing is often a suitable choice.
 Lay the embroidery piece, the right side up, flat upon a board or table and cover it with the paper.,, Powdered graphite or charcoal will also work. You could even rub over the embroidery using a large coin - the outlines will not, of course, be very clearly defined upon the paper and will have to be gone over and carefully supplemented afterwards with a pencil., As soon as you have fixed the lines of the pattern by drawing them over with ink, it is ready for use.

 Don't curse, don't tell dirty jokes, (most women HATE that, and they might not even say anything depending on how shy they are, they might fake a laugh so it's not awkward. If you sense ANY tension, don't tell any more dirty jokes.) and don't excessively stare/look at her or her body. This is a surefire way to make her uncomfortable. You don't want to get slapped.;
, If you're just standing in the corner texting on the phone, she is going to automatically feel like she is not interesting, therefore, she will be feeling self conscious. If you accidentally do this, look at her right in the eyes and tell her she looks "so pretty". (if you have been on a date with her before, beautiful is okay, but if you already have said it right when you saw her at the door, then saying in the middle of a date is weird.
 Open doors for her, say please and thank you to her and her parents/relatives if you meet them, call her father sir, and her mother ma'am. Don't trip over things to get to the door before her so you can open it, that's annoying.
 Don't talk about one thing the whole date, unless you know that she is very interested on the subject. Don't only talk aboutÂ  yourself. And if you are running out of things to say, then ask her a question! " Do you like _____?" (a band, TV show or something similar works here) "How do you feel about _____?"

 Cut that off and put a little frosting on the slice's end cut (what you cut off). Frosting side down, place it on the pound cake's top; just a little to the right of the cut. The pound cake will be the "body" of the truck, while the end cut will be the "cab".;
,, Close and zip the bag, cut a little slit in the corner, and use it as an icier. Create windows on each side of the cab and use the chocolate frosting as an outliner.
 Place 2 to 3 gumdrops on the top of the cab for lights, 2 M&M pieces for headlights, and 4 M&M pieces for hubcaps (place it in the center of each doughnut).
, One of them, place it on the loader arms (this will be a shovel). Outline it with decorator's frosting. Slice a 2 inch (5.1Â cm) portion from the second Twinkie. Place it behind the truck (on the other side for the bucket).
 Add yellow gumdrops for the bucket teeth. Crush or blend the chocolate cookies and spread them around the cake to make "dirt".

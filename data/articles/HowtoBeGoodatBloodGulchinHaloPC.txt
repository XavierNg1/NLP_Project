,, Aim a little up to ensure headshots.
 there isn't really a trick to hitting bouncy noobs, so just keep your cool if you can't hit them. The BEST way to hit a bouncy maniac is to either have a shotgun, or an assault rifle handy as the shots spread.
 In that area, the shotgun would work well.
 The rocket launcher works for warthogs, pistol, shotgun, or plasma rifle for banshees.

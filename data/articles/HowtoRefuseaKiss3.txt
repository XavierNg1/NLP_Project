 You don't need to prove anything â€“ but it might get the person off of your back. Be honest and straightforward. If you aren't in the mood, then just say that you aren't in the mood. If you aren't romantically interested in the person, then be truthful about that.It is perfectly valid to not want a kiss. Don't let the person convince you to kiss him/her even if you aren't sure.
Don't over-explain. Just say exactly what you need to say to get the point across.
 If he or she truly cares about you, he or she should respect your wishes and wait until you are ready. Do not let anybody pressure you into a kiss. It will be so much better if you're ready for it.
 This way, he or she won't try to kiss you. If the date still tries to kiss you, then consider whether this is really someone that you want to be with.
 Sometimes, a person will keep asking you for a kiss even after you've made it clear that you aren't interested. Try to talk about something else. If that doesn't work, then find an excuse to leave as soon as possible. Do not wait around if someone's making you feel uncomfortable! It can be that the only way to end these situations is to leave them.

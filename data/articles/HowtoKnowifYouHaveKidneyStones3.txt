 Kidney stones can become more severe and painful if left untreated. If you think that you may have kidney stones, then you should see a doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor can diagnose your kidney stones based on your symptoms, a blood or urine test, or by using imaging such as a CT scan.Getting a CT scan is the most accurate way to determine if you have kidney stones. Your doctor can also use the results of the kidney stones to determine where the stones are at and how big they are., If you are diagnosed with kidney stones, then your doctor will recommend the best course of treatment for your situation. This may include drinking plenty of water in order to help pass the kidney stones or administering special medications to help you pass the stones.


If you kidney stones are large, then your doctor may need to use something called “extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy” or ESWL. This procedure breaks large stones into smaller ones so that you can pass them more easily.Your doctor can also use a scope to break up a stone that is trapped in your ureter and make it easier for your body to pass.Be aware that surgery may be required for severe cases of kidney stones that do not respond to other forms of treatment., If your pain is severe, then your doctor may prescribe a prescription pain-killer. But in less severe cases of kidney stones, an over-the-counter pain killer will help to numb the pain.You may take ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or aspirin depending on your medical needs and personal preferences.
Ask your doctor for a recommendation if you are not sure what to take.
Read and follow the product instructions for any medicine that you take.

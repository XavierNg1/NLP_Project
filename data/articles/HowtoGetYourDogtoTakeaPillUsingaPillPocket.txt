,, If you need to cut the pill in half or quarters for the correct dose, do this first. Then just slide the pill into the open side of the Pill Pocket., You may skip peanut butter; if you close the Pill Pocket's opening and your dog will eat it all, great! But s/he may outsmart you by eating the pocket and spitting the pill out. The peanut butter helps make everything sticker so they can't just spit out the pill.

Grab a teaspoon and fill 1/3 of it with peanut butter.
Transfer this peanut butter to the Pill Pocket, completely covering the opening.
 If you haven't sealed the end off with peanut butter, just squeeze the opening closed to seal it. The sides of the Pill Pocket will stick together to make one, delicious treat with the pill hidden inside., Watch how your dog "inhales" the pill and be surprised!

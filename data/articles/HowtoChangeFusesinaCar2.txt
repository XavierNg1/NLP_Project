 Use the fuse panel diagram, the numbered color-coded fuses and the owner’s manual to help you determine the correct amperage for your new fuse. Once you have the right fuse gently push it into the correct slot, make sure it’s completely installed, and then put the fuse panel back on the car.
 Once you are done replacing the fuse, turn the ignition and check to see if the circuit giving you trouble is working correctly. If it is working, chances are you just had a temporary surge that blew the fuse. If that's the case, then you just solved the problem.

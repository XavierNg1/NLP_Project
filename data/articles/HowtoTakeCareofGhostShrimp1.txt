 If you aren't planning on breeding your ghost shrimp, a small tank will do. Don't get anything smaller than 5 gallons (18.9Â L). In general, ghost shrimp aren't picky about the shape or color of their tank, but as adults they can get aggressive with one another so giving them ample space is important.;
, Even though ghost shrimp do much of the cleaning themselves, a filter is necessary for a healthy aquarium. Now there are two types of filter you should consider. External filters are good for changing water and filtering out the bad stuff. Internal Sponge filters are highly recommended because they can also be as food source for shrimps. Filters come in a huge range of prices starting at about $25.00. For a few ghost shrimp a heavy duty filter is unnecessary.You must purchase an external filter that pulls the water out of the tank before filtering if you have a huge tank.
 Ghost shrimp need a pump in their tank to oxygenate their water. If you only have shrimp and have a hanging filter, you can skip the air pump. Pumps start at about $15.00 (you will still have to buy air tubing).
 Ghost shrimp are bottom dwellers and they get their sustenance from pieces of food that have fallen from above. Gravel or sand at the bottom of the tank works to catch their food and provide easy access to a meal. Gravel and sand can be bought at any pet store and will come in multiple different colors, styles and prices.
 Ghost shrimp can cost as little as 30 cents to as high as $3.00 for a single shrimp. Consider whether you want to buy a single shrimp or an assortment. Many pet stores and online vendors sell in them in bulk for a discount. Note that for many stores, availability is seasonal. When picking a shrimp out, pay attention to color: not all ghost shrimp are alike and can range from completely clear to red.

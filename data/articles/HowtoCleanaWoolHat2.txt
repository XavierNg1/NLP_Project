 Gather a load of wool clothes, if possible, and wash them all at once. If you don’t have much wool, wash your hat with similar items like knitted clothing or blankets. If your washer has a center agitator, wash your hat in a mesh laundry bag with other clothing.Be sure to only wash your hat with similar colors or add a color catcher cloth to make sure your hat does not soak up any other colors.
If your washer does not have a center agitator, it’s okay to wash the hat by itself.
Only wash stocking cap style hats in the washer. Hats with a bill, brim, or other structural pieces should only be washed by hand.
 Basic laundry detergent can damage the fibers of a wool hat, so don’t use standard detergent. Use either wool-specific detergent, such as Woolite, or another mild detergent for delicate fabrics.Never pour the detergent directly onto the wool hat, as too much detergent on the hat could damage the fibers. Either put the detergent in after water has been added or pour it away from the wool hat.
 Excessively hot water can shrink wool and damage the fibers, so never put a washing machine on a hot cycle with your wool hat. Make sure that the soak, wash, and rinse cycles are all either warm or cold.Water temperature on the warm setting should be 80℉ (27℃) or below. If you don’t know the temperature of the warm setting, it’s best to stick with cold water.
 Since wool is not as tough as some other materials, do not use the normal wash settings. Choose “Delicates,” or even “Wool cycle,” if it is an option. Whichever setting provides the gentlest wash is the best setting for your hat.If the washer you want to use does not offer a gentle setting, it is best to wash your wool hat by hand.

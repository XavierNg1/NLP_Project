 If the barb is not too deep in the skin or tissue of your finger, you may wish to try using a needle to ease the hook out. This works best on a large hook with a single barb.Don't forget to clean the area before attempting removal. Flush the wound with water to clear out as much dirt and debris as possible.
 You will use the tip of the needle to press down on the barb of the hook so that you can slide the barb out without it catching on your skin.


A sterile, 18-gauge or larger needle should be used if possible â€” this method may not work otherwise.You can sterilize the needle with rubbing alcohol. If you don't have access to alcohol, you can hold the tip of the needle into a flame (as from a lighter) until the metal glows red.
, Slowly back the needle and hook out of the entrance wound.Both instruments need to be removed together, as the needle tip is keeping the barb from damaging the surrounding tissue. Make sure you are putting adequate pressure on the needle and hook.

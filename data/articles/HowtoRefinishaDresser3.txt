 For a dresser, check that the following things are in good working order (and if not, repair them):


The drawers slide in and out without sticking.
The drawers are intact, have no nails or other sharp objects sticking out anywhere and have no broken bits.
Check that the legs are sturdy and that the dresser does not wobble. Test this on an even surface, otherwise you might assume that the dresser is uneven when it's actually the floor.
There are no unsightly indentations or scratches. If there are, treat these with an appropriate wood-filling agent and sand off before adding the refinish.
If the dresser has a mirror, check for cracks, chips or spotting. Mirrors can be DIY repaired to a certain extent, but you may wish to seek the advice of an expert.
If the dresser has spindles, check that these are in good order, without chips or cracks, etc.
If the dresser has doors, check that the hinges are in good condition. If not, replace these with nice new ones.

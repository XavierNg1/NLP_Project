 Pour the cup (236.6 mL) of dry kernels or other heat-absorbent foodstuff, such as dried beans or peas, into the sock. Let it settle at the bottom., Add an equal amount of fluffy stuffing as you did foodstuff. Quilt batting is a heat-absorbent stuffing found at craft stores. You can substitute in another stuffing, such as that from an old pillow.
 Next, add another cup of your corn kernels, then follow it with another cup of quilt batting. Alternate these layers until the sock is stuffed all the way to the top.
 This is optional but can be done to cover a large crack, such as the underside of a doorway. You may need to create one or two more draft protectors, depending on the length of sock. Repeat the steps to fill these socks with half corn kernels, half stuffing.
 Place the open end of one of your socks next to the bottom end of another one, if combining them into a larger draft protector. Pull the open end over the bottom of the next sock. Repeat this with other socks you wish to add., Where the socks meet, take needle and thread. Sew the hem of the outer sock to the one it covers. Alternatively, apply fabric glue and let it rest for an hour. Decorate the socks as you please, such as by sewing on eyes and a tongue to form a snake.

 This should be the first thing that you do before starting to do big things like upgrading the gun or just buying a new one. The hop-up is a system that applies back-spin to BBs to make them fly straighter and more accurately. If your gun does not have enough hop-up, then it is not performing at its peak level; if there is too much hop-up, then it will not shoot accurately and the range may even decrease. This article cannot tell you how to adjust the hop-up on your gun since every type has the hop-up in a different place, but if you find it and spend the time to set it, your gun should perform much better.;
, If you have a sniper, then you will probably have a scope. If your sniper is inaccurate, then you may want to adjust the scope. There are dials on the sides of the scope that allow you to adjust that cross hairs and fine tune your sniper's accuracy.
 If you are using a .40g BB with a $10 pistol then you will want a lighter BB, but if you are using a .12g with a sniper, then you will want a heavier BB (.25+g). If you have a sniper, then you want to be using at least a .30 gram BB. (Remember, the heavier the BB the better the accuracy, but the fps will be reduced!)

, This can be tricky, but there may be videos online that will help you figure this out. If you have a sniper or AEG, then you would want to get at least a 6.03mm tight bore barrel. 6.01mm would be the ideal size, but you would have to clean it religiously because even the tiniest bit of dirt could cause the BB to get jammed in the barrel.

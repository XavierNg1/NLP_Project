 To function at your best, you will need to be well rested and alert at the start of the school day. If you have kept late hours during summer vacation, you may find it difficult to adjust to the earlier schedule. Since the amount and quality of your sleep impact your academic success,it is important to start this adjustment before classes begin.


Regular sleeping patterns lead to higher quality sleep. Establish a routine of preparation for sleep and a consistent schedule., If you can, study at regular times. Once a pattern is set, you will find it easier to get started and use your time efficiently. On days that you don’t have homework or tests to prepare for, keep the routine by practicing a skill or reading about a topic that interests you beyond class assignments.


Your schedule will likely vary somewhat from day to day, especially if you are involved in sports, clubs, or work. Even if you cannot study on the same day every week, try to develop consistent hours or weekly patterns. For example, if your work schedule changes each week, try to reserve one night early in the week and one night late in the week to complete your assignments.
 Mourning routines are often hurried as you rush to make it to class on time. Before the year begins, make sure you know how much time you will need to prepare in the mourning and prepare to wake up early enough to do so properly.


Plan what you will wear the night before. If your mornings are hectic or stressful, choose the next day’s clothes in advance. This will simplify the hurried morning routine and reduce stress.
 Once the school year starts, you may be rather busy for several weeks or months. As you get ready for the school year, try to schedule a haircut, dentist appointments, and doctor’s appointments. Even if you cannot get everything done before the year starts, it will help to have important meetings scheduled in advance.

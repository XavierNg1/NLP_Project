 Select two shades that match your outfit. Make sure you select colours that go well with each other. Try not to choose colours that over-contrast.;
, Use a brush that is specifically for eyeshadow, as it will provide the best results.
 Dab the brush lightly with your selected colour. This colour will start from the side closest to the nose. Close one of your eyes. Use a mirror. Gently stroke your brush in small strokes that reach halfway through the eyelid.
 Apply this colour on the remaining half of your eyelid.
 Using one side of the brush that has not been used, lightly go over the place where both colours join.
 If the two colours you used do not look nicely blended or unusual, choose a shade that is between them two. Don't use too much of this colour. Apply this shade along the place where both colours join. Then use the clean side of the brush and go over the shade lightly.

 If the water that comes out of the faucet is a trickle or lower in pressure than usual, its water supply pipe is likely frozen.
 As the water running through the pipe is above freezing temperature, it will help thaw the pipe.
 Places to look are where exposed pipes run along outside a house or through the foundation where your water supply enters the house.
 Apply heat from an electric hair dryer or a portable space heater. Make sure no flammable items or materials are nearby.


Towels soaked in hot water can also be used to wrap frozen pipes in. Heat the water for the towels in a pot or other suitable container on the stove.
, Thaw any other frozen pipes you can access.

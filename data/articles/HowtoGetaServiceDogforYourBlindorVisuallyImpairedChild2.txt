 Once you’ve researched schools and dogs, you will need to submit an application to the guide dog school of your choice. Most schools offer the option of submitting it online or mailing a paper copy.The application will require you to provide information about your health, finances, travel practices, and whether or not your child has received Orientation and Mobility training.
 Most guide dog schools will require you to interview over the telephone once they receive your application. After the initial interview a representative from the school will set up a home visit to ensure your child is a good fit for a service dog. You will then be approved or rejected for admission to the school.


You will be interviewed about your finances, lifestyle, and the child’s health history and educational arrangement.
 Getting a guide dog and attending training will require you to pay fees to the guide dog school. For many programs these fees can be as little as $1. Other programs may cost several hundreds of dollars. Be sure you discuss the financial cost of the dog and program with the school before signing up for guide dog training.
 Once accepted, your child will complete an on campus training that will last approximately two to three weeks. The school will pair your child with a dog. While at the school, your child and their new canine companion will engage in intensive training. Your child will stay on site at the school for the duration of the training.Depending on your child’s age, you may be required to attend the training with them.

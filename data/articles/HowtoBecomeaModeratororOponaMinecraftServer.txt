 You're going to be devoting a lot of time to it when you are a moderator/OP, so make sure you will enjoy it.;
, Don't go right in with asking for Moderator/OP rank. Gradually tell the players and owner (if there) get to know you.
 Be the first to provide help to players in need and conform to the rules. Be nice, don't curse a lot, and help newcomers enjoy the server.


Be nice. Give people tips, post funny stuff and talk about a great part of the server.
 This will get you an answer of whether or not you should keep trying, and tell the owner/mods that you are interested in becoming one.


Just ask "Hey do you guys need another staff member? I really care about this server and don't want to see it go on the wrong path."

, Continue to provide help and tips to newcomers, as well as being nice. Don't just rage-quit the server because you aren't a mod/Op right away. Do not keep asking and asking if they need more every day, be calm, if they have a website or forum, keep an eye out for announcements.
 Wait until you have about three weeks' playtime under your belt before doing this. Make sure that the players and staff respect and know you. Just ask if any new spots have opened, and say that you would like to become one if they have. If there are no spots open, just tell the staff that they can always ask you when they are.
 The server may have a section on their website to apply for Mod or any Admin, if so, fill out the application form with detailed text and with good spelling and grammar. Do not keep asking when they will check the application, a lot of owners find this annoying and may even deny your application.
 Being a staff member on a server does not mean you can abuse your power, it means you have been assigned to help out the players and help the community. If you do not get promoted, keep trying and improving your knowledge on the server and when you are experienced, try again.

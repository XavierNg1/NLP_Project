 In order for an egg to be fertile, a female bird must mate with a male to produce an egg with both male and female genetic material to create an embryo inside the egg. If you only own female birds, then all eggs laid by them will be infertile.


An unfertilized egg or an egg only containing female genetic material is called a blastodisc.
In fertile eggs or eggs that contain both female and male genetic material, the blastodisc is then term a blastoderm. The blastoderm is also called the first stage of embryonic development., Eggs must be kept warm in at least 85°F (30°C) temperature for the egg to develop into an embryo. You can stunt this development by taking the egg away from the bird and placing the eggs in a cool or refrigerated place.


You'll need to do this rather quickly after the egg is laid. It can take as short as several hours for the embryo to being forming in the right conditions.
 The time it takes for a chick to hatch in incubation varies between different species of birds. Most lovebird eggs hatch in 2 weeks while chickens take up to 21 days to hatch.If nothing happens to the egg past this period, the egg was most likely infertile or the embryo died and stopped its development.


This method is not recommended for consumption if you are checking chicken eggs. If your egg has been in an incubator for 21 days or left out in room temperature for more than 7 to 10 days, the egg will have most likely gone bad or is beginning to rot.

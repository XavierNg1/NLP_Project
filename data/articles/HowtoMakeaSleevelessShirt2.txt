 An old t-shirt is the best option for this method, as other shirts might have wider necklines that won't lend as well to making a tank.


The way this method differs from Method 1 is that in the first method, the shirt still came out to the edge of your shoulder and simply had the sleeves removed. In this method, we are removing both the sleeves and the neckline to make a tank.
Men's style t-shirts are a good option, because they tend to be looser-fitting than women's t-shirts., It is important that the surface is flat so that you cut the shirt evenly.
 Be sure to stick close to the seam, because this creates a wider neck opening than it seems.Stay within ¼ inch of the seam.
The cut doesn't have to be perfectly “straight,” especially if you're going for more of a grunge look. This means that the cut doesn't have to maintain the exact same distance from the seam all the way around the neckline.
Pull the shirt tight while you cut to avoid bunching and to make cutting easier.
 Unlike with the neckline cut, you will not follow the curve of the sleeve for this cut.


Start at the armpit and cut with a slight curve up toward the middle of the distance between the neck and the sleeve.You want to leave a good width for the strap of the tank, which should be about an inch-and-a-half or more.
Pull the sleeves tight while you cut to avoid bunching and to make the cutting easier.
 A double-turn hem is a simple and quick way to seal these new edges.


Fold your new edge to the inside of the shirt ¼ inch and press. Then, fold it in again another ¼ inch and press again. Use your sewing machine and its presser foot, also known as a rolled hem foot, to sew the folds down for the hem.Repeat on all edges, including both new armholes and the neckline.
Hemming is not necessary if you want your tank to have a grunge look.

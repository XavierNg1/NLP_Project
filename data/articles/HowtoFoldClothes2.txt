 This can be anything from jeans to khakis. You'll want to begin this method by holding the trousers in front of you. From there you'll fold the trousers vertically, bringing the legs together, with the pockets on the outside.









Bring the legs to just above the top of the pocket or about two or three inches below the waistline if there is no pocket.
 You will want to fold your these trousers so that the crease, not the seam is in front (which is what you do with an uncreased pair of trousers). Begin by holding the trousers from their cuffs and making sure the crease is in front.









Smooth the pant leg and fold in half at the knees, with the bottoms and the waistline touching.
Bring the knees to the top. Smooth.

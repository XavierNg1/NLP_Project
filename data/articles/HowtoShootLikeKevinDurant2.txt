 Durant shoots the ball. A lot. If you want to start shooting like KD shoots, start taking lots of shots and upping your shooting average. Focus more during practice on pure shooting drills and less on dribbling or other types of exercise. The jump shot is key to Durant's success and his playing style.


Don't hog the ball, wait for high-probability attempts at a range you're sure you can hit from. Unlike Kobe, who makes plays from scratch, Durant's a team player who waits for the play to come to him.
 Like lots of high-scorers, Kevin Durant is deadly on the inside. His drive and his dribbling skills on the cut aren't necessarily his most famous attributes, but shot-diagrams prove that the majority of his points come from inside. His tremendous height makes his inside play aggressive and high-probability, especially when matched with his outside accuracy.
 Shot charts show that the majority of Durant's points come from his right side, both in the paint and outside 3-point range. While he's accurate, or at least at the league average from all over the court, he's most deadly from the right side. Again, one of the Durant trademarks is his smarts, and knowing where the high-probability shots are and when to take them.


Durant is less accurate from long-range when he's lined up straight on, and takes less attempts from that location on the court. To shoot like Durant, take it on an angle when you're in long-range, or cut into the paint., If you want to shoot like Durant, there's no quick fix. You've got to start working on a regular shooting routine, practicing until you've got a jump shot you can take in your sleep. Practice on your strong side and your weak side, practice after running sprints when you're exhausted and can barely lift your arms, practice three pointers, turn-around jumpers, and free throws. Practice constantly.

 Is it possible your smile actually adds something special to your look? Everyone can pay to get straight white teeth, but that would get a little boring. Try to embrace your smile as a unique part of yourself that you're proud to show off. Got a gap in your teeth? A snaggle tooth? Are your teeth crooked? Try owning it instead of being embarrassed. Think like Anna Paquin, Jewel Kilcher and Hugh Grant, celebrities who have capitalized on their adorably quirky smiles, embracing what makes them unique.
 This isn't easy to do, but try to stop thinking about what you look like when you smile. If you're worried about your teeth, it's going to show in your expression, and your smile will look unnatural and won't have a positive effect. Instead of thinking about how you look when you smile, focus on what you're smiling about.


Meeting someone new? Think about how excited you are to get to know someone who could become a great friend or business colleague.
Did someone make you laugh? Let yourself heartily enjoy the joke, instead of catching yourself before you smile too big.
 Do your best not to let your negative feelings about your smile impact how you express joy. When you smile happily, the positive vibes of your attitude can totally outweigh your looks. Giving a half-smile or looking solemn a lot will actually draw more attention to what you're trying to hide. You can take steps to feel more confident about your smile, like whitening your teeth and figuring out you best angle, but ultimately, letting yourself express uninhibited joy is the best way to have an infectious smile.

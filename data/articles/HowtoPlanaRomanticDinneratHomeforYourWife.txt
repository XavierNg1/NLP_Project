 Write down everything she likes that you think will make the night all the greater. Now of that list gather the things she's least familiar with, meaning things she hasn't seen or you haven't done for her in the longest time. Like if one of the list items was (take a bath together) and you haven't done that in over a year, whereas something else like (walk on the beach together at night) you did last month, well then choose the things you haven't done in a while. And for one of the things you choose that she likes, add a twist to it. Stimulate her mind. For instance, if she loves chocolate then maybe you could make her homemade chocolate rum balls (they only take ten minutes, and you could share them with her in the bath).;
, The more you plan the better, although it doesn't mean you have to do everything you plan or that you can't be flexible. But the more you have lined up to possibly do, the better. This way things won't get dull or boring and risk one of you falling asleep on the couch. Things will stay fun and stimulating.
 If she doesn't like all that much excitement, then perhaps falling asleep together on the couch might be something you could plan that she would enjoy (maybe surprise her with a new soft blanket to wrap around her). When you know the small details, this is what makes her feel special and lets her know that you pay attention to her (a cornerstone in a relationship).
 This gives the woman something to appreciate, something to admire which reflects your admiration of her. Your tangible affection in her hands.

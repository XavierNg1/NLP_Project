 Also inspect if any other pieces of the glasses need cleaning. Pieces to look out for are the nose and earpieces. These come into contact with hair and natural oils on your skin, which can quickly accumulate to make them dirty quicker. If they do need a quick clean, then wipe them with the microfiber cloth., Don’t be counterproductive and clean with a dirty cloth! Not only is using a clean cloth avoids transferring dirt and other residue, but it highly reduces the risks of scratching lenses when wiping off an eyeglass cleaning solution.
 It’s best to use a spray that came with the glasses when you purchased them. Sprays that are specific to your sunglasses will protect any extra coatings the lenses have on them. Try to spray from a distance that evenly coats the lenses, so when you wipe there isn’t any buildup of solution to accumulate to form smudges.
 Gently apply a bit of pressure. Wipe with a circular motion, back and forth to reduce lines and smudges.

 If you often feel hungry and it is interfering with your ability to lose weight, then make an appointment with your doctor. Your doctor can examine you and run tests to determine if there is an underlying condition. Your doctor may also be able to recommend treatment options that are suited to your needs. When you meet with your doctor, ask lots of questions, such as:


"What is my ideal body weight?"
"What treatment options do I qualify for?"
"What are the risks and benefits of these treatments?"
"Are these treatments covered by my insurance?"

, Counseling is often recommended for emotional eating. If your eating is related to the feelings you are having rather than to physical hunger, then starting therapy may help you. Ask your doctor for a referral to a licensed mental health professional in your area.Try to find a therapist who has experience helping people with emotional eating issues.
Support groups can also be beneficial for dealing with the hunger pangs of dieting and for forming new habits. Ask your therapist about emotional eating support groups in your area.
 If you have tried counseling and other weight loss methods without success, then medication may be a good choice. Talk to your doctor about your medication options for losing weight. There are several prescription weight loss drugs available including:


Xenical (orlistat)
Belviq (lorcaserin)
Qsymia (phentermine and topiramate)
Contrave (buproprion and naltrexone)
Saxenda (liraglutide)

, Weight loss surgery may be your best option if you are obese. However, to qualify for this surgery, you need to have a BMI that is above 40, or a BMI above 35 with other weight-related health problems. You will also have to demonstrate that you are prepared to make the changes necessary to lose weight.Keep in mind that weight loss surgery can be risky. Make sure to discuss this option thoroughly with your doctor.

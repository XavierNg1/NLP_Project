 Moving from a foster home or a shelter to another new environment can be a stressful situation for dogs. Know that your dog will need time to adjust to its new home. A new puppy may miss its mother, and an older dog may be wary or nervous by the change. Show your dog where its water, bed, and toys are, and then allow it to explore the area on its own.
 Welcoming your new dog into the family is an exciting time, but be sure to make introductions slowly. Your dog may feel in danger if there are several new people around crowding it, trying to pet it, and vying for its attention. Ask everyone to be calm and take turns getting acquainted with the new addition., Create a schedule and routine for your new dog, and share it with members of your family. Decide how often to feed your dog, how and when to exercise it, and how often it will be cleaned and groomed.Creating and sticking to a schedule will help remind you of your responsibilities to your dog, and it will allow you to plan ahead and adjust for any conflicts well in advance.


If members of your family are going to help care for the dog, consider assigning specific duties to each person so that everyone is included in the care of your new pet.

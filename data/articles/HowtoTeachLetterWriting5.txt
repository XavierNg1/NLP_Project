 It is important to find out how much and how well each student has taken in your lesson and the skills taught. You can do this aspect in many different ways, through quizzes, marking written examples of the students and even using well regulated peer review. The methods to assess learning are vast and a matter of choice to reflect the students you are teaching however it is important to perform this step.


Be sure to ask students if they feel they have gotten what they wanted out of the course. This may feel confronting the first time you ask but it's one of the best ways to find out if you're teaching the students what they wish to know. If you do this at regular intervals, it can allow you to tailor the course and get more skills across in the time you have allotted.
 This step is taken on your own after the classes are finished to help you as a teacher in the future. Did everything go as you planned? Do you feel your plan was effective and efficient? Are there areas needing improvement? Using your past experiences to build on your future performance will assist you in continuing to grow as an effective and productive teacher.

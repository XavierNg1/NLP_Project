 With APA style, the first in-text reference to a particular scripture should include the book, chapter and verse, followed by the version of the Bible it was taken from.


For example: "In the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly father" (Matt. 5:16 New Living Translation).
Note that there is no comma between the scripture and version.
 Once you have explicitly referenced the version of the Bible used in your first citation, you do not need to keep repeating it.


You can simply give the scripture reference, e.g. (Matt. 5:16) for all remaining citations, unless you switch to a different version.
 Either punctuation mark is acceptable as long as you remain consistent.


For example, (Matt. 5:16) or (Matt. 5.16).
 According to the APA style manual, it is usually unnecessary to provide references for the Bible, in addition to other well-known classical texts.


However, if you are writing a paper for class, your professor may prefer that you provide full publication information, so it may be best to ask if you are unsure.

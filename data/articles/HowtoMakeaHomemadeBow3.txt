 The ½ inch PVC pipe is sold in 10 foot sections. Use a measuring tape and permanent marker to divide the pipe into three 40 inch sections. Cut the pipe into three equal sections with a hacksaw or fine tooth jigsaw., Use your saw to cut a notch 1 inch in length into the top of the pipe. Flip the PVC pipe over. Cut a second 1 inch long notch on the opposite end of the PVC Pipe in alignment with the first notch., Tie a knot in one end the nylon rope. The knot should be thick enough so that it will not slip through the notch you created. Burn the end of the knot with a lighter to prevent the rope from fraying., The process of stringing the bow requires a bit of patience and some muscle.


Insert the rope into the top notch so that the knot is situated inside the pipe.
Pull the string tightly down the length of the bow.
Cut the rope 5 inches beyond the bottom of the pipe.
Tie a knot in the rope approximately 4 ½ inches from the end and burn the ends. Like the first knot, the second knot should be thick enough so that it does not slip through the notch.
Bend the pipe and slide the rope into the bottom notch so that the knot is situated inside the pipe.
Wrap a piece of duct tape around each end of the bow to prevent the string from moving., Place the 6 inch piece of pipe foam around the PVC pipe at its center. Bring together the two edges of the pipe foam. Place a zip tie over each end of the pipe foam to secure it in place. Cut the ends off of the zip tie with a pair of scissors., To create arrows, you will need dowels, 2 inch thick home insulation foam, a hot glue gun, and a knife.


Use a sharp knife to create 3 inch x 3 inch triangles out of the 2 inch home insulation foam.
Insert the dowel into the center of one of the triangle’s three sides.
Remove the dowel, coat the end with hot glue, and reinsert the dowel into the foam arrow head.
Slit the end of the dowel with a sharp knife. The slit makes it easier to string the arrow.

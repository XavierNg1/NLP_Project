 Spray a medium nonstick skillet with cooking spray and set the pan on the stove over medium heat.
 Pour the egg whites into the preheated skillet. Sprinkle the whites with pepper.


Adjust the amount of pepper according to personal taste. If you aren't sure about how much to use, start with only a dash. You can add more pepper while serving the finished egg whites.
 As soon as the egg whites begin setting, chop and stir them using a turning spatula. Continue for about 2 minutes, or until the egg whites are firm and no longer glossy.
 Sprinkle the chopped tomatoes and feta cheese crumbles over the scrambled eggs. Toss for several seconds, or until evenly combined.


If you don't like tomatoes and feta cheese, you could try other combinations. Onions, spinach, and zucchini are other popular vegetable options. No matter what you choose, however, you should only use up to 1/2 cup (125 ml) per single serving of egg whites. You can also serve the egg whites plain if you'd prefer them without vegetables or cheese.
 Spoon the scrambled egg whites onto a serving plate and enjoy them while they're still hot.

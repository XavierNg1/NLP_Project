 It should be something with a common theme, not just random nonsense. A YTP Short will often be a minute or less, so try to make it long enough for it to still tell a story. Don't drag it out. Going on about the same thing for too long gets boring and you will lose your audience.;
, This is especially important in a YTP short since they lack the depth of a regular YTP. Be sure to repeat, edit the picture, and add some short conversations between characters here and there. Do not repeat too much or your video will look unprofessional.
 The title is especially important. It should be (but doesn't have to be) something that has to do with the story. Choose tags and a category that fit the video. Send your video to friends and others on YouTube and Google+ to boost views and encourage your audience to comment and rate.

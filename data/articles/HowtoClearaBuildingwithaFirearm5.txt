 A partner or two in hallways with doors and T-intersections would be very appreciated as, at some point, you will be forced to turn your back on an area you have not yet cleared. You, however, as a private citizen, will likely have to clear it alone. Therefore, you must keep your eyes and ears open and balance multiple danger problems to keep your risk at a minimum. Don't be fooled though, this process, and the other processes in this article, all pose very high risk., Never make your way down the middle of a hallway. At the same time, keep from touching the walls. Hallways are similar to doorways, meaning that they are a narrow passage that an intruder may be expecting you to come through. The middle of the hallway is your fatal funnel.
 Be aware, however, that stopping in a hallway to clear a room means that you have not cleared the rest of the hallway, and an unexplored (uncleared) area is now at your back.


Corners are no different, but what happens if there are two corners in two directions? This is a T-intersection. See the next section for more detailed information on how to clear a T-intersection.
 The areas you have not cleared still contain danger points and you should be splitting some of your attention toward the uncleared areas.
 Doing this means that you now have a room at your back that is uncleared, a hallway in front of you which is uncleared and the room you are intending you enter is also uncleared. This presents an overwhelming amount of danger zones. Placing yourself in this situation is unjustifiably dangerous.

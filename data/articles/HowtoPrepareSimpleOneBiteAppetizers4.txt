 Take ¼ pound (113 g) of extra sharp auricchio provolone cheese and use a sharp knife to cut it into small pieces. You want the pieces to be small enough to fit inside the peppers so aim for 1-inch cubes.If you prefer, you can substitute mozzarella for the auricchio provolone.
 After you’ve cut the cheese into pieces, cut 5 slices of thin prosciutto in half. Next, place several cubes of the cheese in the center of each piece of prosciutto and wrap the ham around the cheese in a bundle., Use a knife to cut the stems off 10 spicy cherry peppers and scrape out the seeds to create a well. Place one of the prosciutto and provolone bundles in each pepper to fill it.If you aren’t a fan of spicy foods, you can substitute cherry tomatoes for the peppers.
 Place the stuffed peppers in a bowl, and pour ½ cup (118 ml) of extra virgin olive oil over them. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the peppers. Allow them to marinate in the oil overnight., An hour or two before you plan to serve the peppers, remove the bowl from the refrigerator and set them out to come to room temperature. Place them on a platter to serve.You may want to serve the stuffed peppers with toothpicks. The oil makes them greasy so they can be slightly messy to pick up with fingers.

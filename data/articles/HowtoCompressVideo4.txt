 Navigate to the movie file on your computer. This method only works with QuickTime movie files (.mov).
 Click Encode Selected Movie File from the bottom of the menu. This will open the Encode Media pop-up window.
 In the Setting menu, choose the resolution that you would like to encode the movie in. 1080P is the highest setting, and is the standard Hi-Definition resolution. 720P is lower quality but is also considered Hi-Definition.


Choosing a resolution higher than the original resolution will not result in a better looking movie.
You can also choose to just extract the audio in the Setting menu.
 If you plan to watch the movie on multiple devices, select “Greater compatibility” from the “Encode for” menu. This will make the format H.264 video and AAC audio, one of the most compatible formats available.
 Once you are satisfied with your settings, you can start the encoding process. You can see the target data rate and resolution in the Encode Media window, as well as compatible devices. Choose your destination and click Continue when you are ready.

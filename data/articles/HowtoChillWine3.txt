 Always keep your wines in an area under 70ºF (21ºC) and away from direct sunlight. Store horizontally on a wine rack to keep the cork moist., If you plan to age wines or store expensive wines, but don't have a wine cellar, use a basement or closet. The temperature should be close to 55ºF (13ºC), and the area should be quite humid. If this environment is not available in your home, move on to the options below.
 You can build your own cheap "cellar" by excavating a pit in a shaded area of your backyard. Place the wine bottles inside a wooden box, insulate the box on all sides with aluminum foil, and lower it into the pit. Cover the pit with plywood or any sturdy cover. Including a thermometer is recommended, since soil temperatures and climate can vary greatly, but as long as the temperature stays stable at a temperature between roughly 45–60ºF (7–16ºC), it can be used to store wine at larger quantities and lower expense than a refrigeration system.
 These are sometimes called electric wine cellars, and are the most expensive option for storing your wine, after hiring someone to dig a full-scale cellar! You may prefer to spend the extra money on pre-aged wines instead, but the wine fridge could be a good option if you have a few dozen bottles, or if you want to taste how different bottles of the same vintage age over time.


Full-featured models allow different temperature zones for different types of wine.

,,,,,, You may want to commit up to 15% of your income to retirement for 20 or 30 years which will be tough to do. An accountability partner can help hold you to your commitment.When a rough rising and falling market makes you uneasy, he or she will be there to encourage you to stick to it.
 Maybe you're thinking you have extra income to buy a bigger, more expensive house with all of the payments and interest for many years. He/she should be excited for you, but shouldn't let you get carried away before suggesting to "think it through".


How will it affect your investing for the next few or even many years.
Review your goals and make sure a new house fits into your plan without threatening your goals of paying off debts and being in solid financial shape long before reaching retirement age.

Consider a licensed, or certified investing professional as a good choice for a retirement accountability partner because you may:

Trust one with your financial information portfolio and not fear one's being envious or overly competitive with you.
Expect comprehension of your retirement goals and appreciating your commitment to reach them.
Find a pro willing to take the time to learn about your situation, track and discuss your progress.
Receive help to resist flimsy excuses for backing down from your commitment to reach your retirement goals.

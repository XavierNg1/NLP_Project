, Try to keep the location around 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius). Newborns need a warm environment and have trouble regulating their body temperature.Feel their skin to make sure they’re warm, and look for splotchy patterns or any discoloration. If necessary, take a break to swaddle the baby in a warm blanket.
If the baby is sweating, it’s too hot and you should turn down the heat.

Turn on a white noise machine to drown out the noise and avoid startling your newborn. That way, you’ll reduce the chances that they’ll be fussy during the photo shoot., Try continuously making cooing noises to reassure your newborn. They might be a only a few days old, but if you’ve already discovered calming techniques that they like, use them frequently to keep your newborn from fussing.For example, if you’ve found that your newborn loves bouncing, try keeping a yoga ball on hand so you can take calming bouncing breaks during the shoot.
 Getting a newborn to look at the camera is tricky business, so you might want to embrace capturing a natural or sleeping pose. A newborn can only see within a foot of their face, so your best bet is to use sound to get them to look at the camera.Try cooing, speaking softly, or making other quiet noises. Try not to startle your newborn, and if they're sleeping, just let them be.

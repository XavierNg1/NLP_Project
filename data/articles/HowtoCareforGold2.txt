 Dish detergent is the best option for cleaning your gold jewelry because it’s less abrasive than other cleaners. Squirt a few drops of liquid dish detergent into a small bowl full of warm water and swirl the water to mix it., You can leave your jewelry in the soap mixture for up to three hours. You can’t over-clean gold with this mixture, so don’t worry about leaving it in too long. If your jewelry isn’t that dirty, you can leave it in for ten to fifteen minutes.If your jewelry has stones, don’t soak it. Instead, mix the cleaning mixture and then dip a soft cloth into it. Then use the cloth to carefully wipe down your jewelry., This helps you avoid scratching any of your other jewelry while you’re cleaning it. Dip the piece of jewelry in the soapy water, and then gently rub it with your fingers (you can also use a cotton swab).If you have a very heavily ornamented piece with many cracks and crevices, or if your jewelry is very tarnished, you can use a soft-bristled child's toothbrush. Be very gentle when using such a brush.
 Make sure that all traces of suds are gone, especially if you’re cleaning a heavily ornamented piece. The water should run clear when you’re finished., You don’t want to put your jewelry away wet. Use a soft cloth to gently rub the jewelry until it’s dry. You can also leave the jewelry out to air dry, usually overnight., Every three months or so, give all of your gold jewelry a good, deep clean. Let your jewelry soak in the cleaning solution for three hours before you clean each piece.


Don't perform this type of clean on your jewelry more than a few times a year. Over cleaning gold jewelry can cause the metal to break down, which can ruin your jewelry.

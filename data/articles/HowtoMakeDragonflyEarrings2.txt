, The most usual approach to adding dragonfly connectors to earrings is to create dangling or cascade earrings. Here are some suggested design layouts:


Place the dragonfly connector at the base, use a fine wire chain to lead up to the earring hook. Along the chain, attach beads in colors that represent your favorite dragonflies. You might also decide to add a bead between the hook and the chain.
Make a simple beaded loop. Attach through the dragonfly connector loop and attach to the earring hooks.
Attach the dragonfly to the earring hook and create a cascade of beads or chain to a single large bead beneath the dragonfly.
It's recommended that you draw out the design first, then assemble it on a jewelry board to see what it looks like before attaching anything together.
 Use pliers to ensure strength. Once the cascade is assembled, the dragonfly earrings are ready to wear.

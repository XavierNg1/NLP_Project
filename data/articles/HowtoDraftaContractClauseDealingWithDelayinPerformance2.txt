 This clause excuses performance if a major event occurs that completely transforms the circumstances of the agreement in a way neither party could possibly have anticipated.


Force majeure events typically include natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or tornadoes, and political events such as wars, riots, government orders, or trade embargoes. Strikes and labor shortages also may fall into a force majeure clause.
Typically, the events listed have catastrophic and unavoidable consequences that would make performance under the contract impossible.In some states such as Virginia, force majeure clauses are required in all construction contracts.For example, your force majeure clause might state "A party shall not be liable for any failure of or delay in the performance of this Agreement for the period that such failure or delay is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, strikes or labor disputes, embargoes, government orders or any other force majeure event."

, Typically, the contractor won’t need to pay the owner any damages for the delay, and may be entitled to a reasonable extension of time to complete the project.Without a force majeure clause, the parties are left at the mercy of common law rules that only excuse performance rarely under a narrow set of circumstances., While they may not rise to the “force majeure” level, you might want to include provision for delays that occur through no fault of the contractor.


If the contract mentions nothing specifically, courts will only consider a delay excusable if it was caused by circumstances beyond anyone’s control and was unforeseeable by the parties at the time the contract was made.Examples of excusable delays include unforeseen weather events that don’t rise to the level of a catastrophe, strikes, design errors, or material shortages.If the delay results from something in the control of the owner, such as an error in the design or architectural plans, it may be appropriate for the owner to compensate the contractor for any costs he incurred as a result., For example, a hurricane that only impacts a small coastal area near your build site may only cause a brief delay in construction. However, a massive hurricane resulting in the area being flooded for months would render performance impossible.


If a force majeure event renders performance impossible, the clause should allow the parties essentially to walk away from the contract as though it never happened.

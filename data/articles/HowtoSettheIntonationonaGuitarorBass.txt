,, If the pitch of the harmonic sounds the same as the fretted note, then that string is ok.
 The pitch generated by the harmonic is the natural pitch for reference.


If the fretted note sounds lower than the harmonic, then the length of the string should be shortened. Move the saddle towards the headstock. Try one millimetre at a time.

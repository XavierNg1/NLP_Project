 The Suspended 3rd is so-called because, opposite to the minor chord, it raises the third 1/2 step (sharps). It is also called a suspended 4th (mistakenly) because it creates a chord with a 4th and a 5th instead of a 3rd and a fifth.
 With the "C" chord, making a sharp of the 3rd (E) makes it an "F".
 The "sus" chord ALWAYS resolves itself into another chord, usually the base chord. A "C sus" will resolve into the "C" chord.

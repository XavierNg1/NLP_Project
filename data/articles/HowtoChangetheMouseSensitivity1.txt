 Changing the mouse sensitivity is similar in all versions of Windows. The fastest way to bring up the mouse settings is to use the search feature.


If you have a gaming or precision mouse, see Adjusting the DPI for a Gaming Mouse.;
,, You may have to scroll down to the bottom of the current window to see this link.
 This is where you will adjust the pointer speed, which is what most people refer to as “mouse sensitivity.”

, Moving the pointer to the right raises the speed/sensitivity. Moving it to the left slows it down and makes it more precise., This option adjusts the DPI (Dots Per Inch) on the fly to match how quickly you are moving the mouse.This option gives you more control over the pointer so it moves at the exact speed as your hand (or finger, if you are using a trackpad).


If you are using your mouse for gaming, this setting might interfere with precision in your game. Gamers often opt NOT to use this feature for that reason., If you like, you can also change how quickly a double-click registers. Click to the “Buttons” tab and move the speed slider towards “Slow” or “Fast.”


Test the setting by double-clicking the yellow test folder to the right of the slider.
Click “Apply” when satisfied with the changes.
 You can return to this screen at any time to update the settings for your mouse.

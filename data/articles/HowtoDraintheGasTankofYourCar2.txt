 This is a model by model fix, but it should work for most cars. If you can find your fuel tank while underneath the car, and you can detach the lines and/or small drain plug directly, this is the easiest way to drain the car.


Some vehicles have a fuel test port under the hood to which a fuel tester can be attached and drain the fuel with the special tool. This will require turning on the fuel pump while the engine is not running by jumping the fuel pump relay or using a scan tool.
 If you have several gallons of gas left in the tank, you need to be prepared to catch it. This is easier said than done, so try and gauge how much gas is in the tank before beginning and have the appropriate number of containers on hand before starting.


It is very, very hard to plug the tank back up while it is draining, so don't plan on stopping until the job is done.
 The fuel tank is a large, solid metal container on the same side of your car as you fill up gas on. Use your gas door as a gauge -- it is usually underneath the passenger-side seat. Make sure your pan is directly under the plug.


This plug is simply a small bolt screwed directly into the tank. Opening it simply creates a hole for gas to drain out. You usually need a spanner or socket wrench to remove it. However, not all vehicles will have this drain plug.
If you see the fuel lines, which are small, removable hoses underneath the tank, you can use these as well. However, you must turn the car on and off, repeatedly, to force the gas out of the tank, as it uses the electric fuel pump to to all the work., This will take a long time, up to several minutes per gallon, so you should keep an eye on it.Make sure to have more than enough drain pans to catch all the drained fuel and to make sure no fuel is spilled onto the ground.
 Take care to get the plug hooked up again properly, especially if you disconnected the fuel lines. Once everything is hooked back up, you're good to go.

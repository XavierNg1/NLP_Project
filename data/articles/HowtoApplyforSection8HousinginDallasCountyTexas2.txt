 Demand for Section 8 housing outstrips supply in Dallas County. As a result, you will need to apply for a position on a waiting list, and even the waiting list is often closed to new applications. When the list does open, the county may only accept new applicants for a few days at a time.To learn whether Dallas County is currently accepting applications to the Section 8 waiting list, call 214-819-1871.Consult the Dallas County Housing Agency or online Section 8 assistance sites such as Affordable Housing Online regularly so you do not miss an opportunity to place your application on the waiting list.
 The Dallas County Housing Agency will collect information relating to your family income, assets, family composition, and citizenship status, so ensure you have all the documents you need to properly file your application. Dallas County will then verify much of this information with other local agencies, your employer, and your bank, so honesty is important.Order forms like birth certificates and citizenship documents ahead of time so you can provide all necessary documents when the waiting list does open. Remember, your window of opportunity may be limited.
Note that counties may establish preferences for homeless families, those paying more than 50 percent of their income in rent, or those who have been involuntarily displaced. People in these categories may "jump the queue" and receive Section 8 vouchers ahead of others on the waiting list., Ensure you are available by phone, and check both your physical mail and your email regularly for updates on your application.

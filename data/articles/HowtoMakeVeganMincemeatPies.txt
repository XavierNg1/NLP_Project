 Place all of the ingredients apart from the caster (superfine) sugar into the mixing bowl. If you don't want to mix by hand, use a food processor, which will make a finer mincemeat.;
, Prepare the pie or muffin tin (pan) by greasing or flouring each hole.
 Sift the flour and salt into the other mixing bowl. Add the margarine and using your fingertips, gently and quickly rub the fat into the flour. The mix is ready when it resembles breadcrumbs.
 Press the mix together to form a dough.
 Roll the dough out fairly thinly. Cut 12 centimeter (4.7 in) (4 3/4") circles and 10 centimeter (3.9 in) (4") circles from the dough with round dough or biscuit (cookie) cutters.
 Place a heaped teaspoon of mincemeat into the middle of the dough. Cover with a smaller circle. Repeat until all circles have been turned into mincemeat pies.
 Stab the fork in the middle of the pie to create steam escape holes.


Alternatively, simply pinch the edges together and make one small neat hole in the middle of each pie.
 Bake for around 10 minutes or until the pies start to brown lightly.
 Place the entire tin (pan) on the wire cooling rack and leave there to cool.
 Serve warm or cold.

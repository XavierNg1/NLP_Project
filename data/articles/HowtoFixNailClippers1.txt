 A pin or rod-like piece holds the handle of your nail clippers in place and allows you to clip your nails. Locate the pin and then locate the hole near the clipper blades. Take the pin and insert it through the hole. Make sure that the notch in the pin is on the upper side of the clippers.








Hold the pin in place with your thumb by pressing on it from underneath the clippers.;
, Next, squeeze the clipper blades together with your thumb and forefinger while still holding onto the pin. This will expose more of the notched area in the pin and allow you to reattach the handle.








If you find it difficult to squeeze hard enough to bring the blades together, then you can may need to ask someone to help you or use a vice to press the blades together.
 Look at your handle and find the opening on the end of it. This opening attaches to the notch in the pin. Take the open end of your handle and thread it over the notch in the pin. 








After you have done this, you can release the pin. The handle should stay in place from the tension created by the two opposing blades.
 After you have replaced the handle, your clippers should be all better. Flip the handle up and over the pin if you want to clip you nails, or spin it around if you want to close and store the clippers.








Your clippers should be ready to use again!

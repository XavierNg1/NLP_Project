 If you’re concerned about the audience’s ability to follow along with your lecture, print out copies of your outline and hand them out to the audience. If you have a projector available, you could just project a copy of the outline instead. PowerPoint is an excellent tool for presenting an outline along with your spoken lecture.


It isn’t a good idea to read your lecture verbatim from a script so try to limit your outline to the key conceptual aspects of the lecture.
With a PowerPoint or projected outline, don’t over rely on it to keep you on track. Think of it as a note-taking guide for the audience and a way to incorporate visual material like images or video that support your lecture content., Practice will not only improve your technique but lessen any speech anxiety you may be experiencing.Go over your speech as many times as possible to perfect your delivery.


Consider recording yourself delivering the lecture. This will give you direct insight into how your audience will see you.
 Eye contact will demonstrate confidence and help keep your audience engaged. Try to pick out 3 or 4 targets for eye contact amongst the audience ahead of time and rotate between them., Consider how quickly you’re delivering the lecture and variations in your tone. Going too quickly will cause you to lose some members in your audience, as will speaking will a monotone.


Public speaking anxiety can cause you to speed up without noticing it. If you find yourself doing this, break up sentences with some sort of marking reminding you to pause. This make you more conscious of your pace.You can also mark certain words to put emphasis on. This will provide variation in your delivery tone.

 Be proactive and think about things ahead of time so you end up with happy moments instead of just waiting around for bad ones.;
, Even the bad moments are a part of life and you don't need to let them drag you down. Things happen. Just let it go.
 Gratitude is a simple way to make you appreciate your life so much more. There's nothing wrong with having dreams or goals, but in the meantime, enjoy what you have... even though it may not be much.
 When you have the chance to improve yourself or try something new, don't sit around at home and wonder and think about the pros and cons. Just jump in with two feet and do it! New experiences are a great way to help you enjoy your life.
 Learn to laugh and people will be grateful. Laughing creates such a positive energy within you and those who can hear you. Don't take your life too seriously... be willing to admit that yes, some moments are funny.
 No one can take your dreams from you as long as you're still breathing. If you have determination and will power, you can do almost anything. Success is whatever you determine it to be and you can be successful. Even when you do nothing, you are still creating your life so why not make it something to remember?

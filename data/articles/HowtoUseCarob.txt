 Carob is generally available in health food stores. It comes in the following forms:


Powder
Carob chips or drops
Bars;
, It might be as simple as your preference for the taste. One of the main reasons for preferring it over chocolate is that a person has allergies or unpleasant reactions to chocolate. Chocolate causes headaches and some other reactions in sensitive persons. In this case, carob can be substituted without the side effects of chocolate. Another reason is simply that carob adds its own taste dimension to food.
 Carob does not taste like chocolate, so don't expect miracles. However, carob can be used in some of the ways that we use chocolate (such as coating raisins, almonds etc.) and as explained above, you can use less or no sugar with carob. Here are some possible substitute ideas:


Use the powder instead of cocoa powder;
Use in place of hot chocolate powder (the sweetness and lack of dairy products is good for those with dietary restrictions);
Substitute carob chips for chocolate chips in cookie and ice cream recipes;
Use in a variety of baked goods in place of sugar. It will impart a slight brown colouring, as well as its own flavour but you can make the most of its fifty percent content of natural sugar to avoid added sugar content.
 Unlike chocolate, which is very dangerous for dogs, cats, and other pets, carob can be used in their treats without ill effect. Doggy chocs should really be doggy carob drops.

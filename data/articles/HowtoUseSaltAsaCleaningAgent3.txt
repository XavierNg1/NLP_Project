 Combine ¼ cup of salt and ½ cup of baking soda into a large pot filled with water. Add the yellowed items, then boil for 30 minutes. It is not uncommon for larger, thicker items such as tablecloths to require repeated boilings or be left for longer periods of time to whiten., Once you have removed your cotton or linen from the pot, move it to the sink. Run it under cold water, making sure to turn the item until it it soaked and you are sure all the cleaner is removed. This prevents it from turning brown and degrading later.

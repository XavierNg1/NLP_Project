 Whatever you usually use should do, although an air brush effect type foundation is a good choice.;

 This will go on your eyelid. If you have a skin tone closer to Alicia Key's, you'll want to go for a champagne color. For paler skin, go lighter, and for darker skin, go warmer. Whichever shade you go with, make sure it has some shimmer.
 The color, once again, depends on your skin tone. Since this is a smokey eye, make sure it's a bit darker than the first color you used on the lid. A light brown would work well. When you apply the shadow, the outer corner is lifted just a bit.
 To make it look more subtle, blend it a little bit with your finger.
 Extend the shadow slightly along the bottom lash line and up toward the brow.
, Blend it with the white. (Note: Blend, don't cover. You want it to look similar to smudged eyeliner.)

, Starting in the center, go straight out, then curve up a bit in a wing. (The wing doesn't have to be perfect, because you'll smudge it out with a brush in a bit). After you make the wing, finish along the lash line, staying as close to it as possible. Go all the way to your corner.
 (Note: When smudging, do both eyes at once so that they are even and look the same)

, Bring it all the way down to the inner corner again.


Optional: Use black eyeliner pencil to go along the water line on the bottom, but not touching the lash line

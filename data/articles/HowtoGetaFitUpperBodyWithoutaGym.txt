 Think about what you would enjoy - the best exercises will be ones that you will enjoy doing, as that will motivate you and keep you focused. If you love water and birding, and there's a river or lake nearby, take up kayaking or canoeing. If your yard could really stand some weeding, garden. Remember that it doesn't have to be what most people consider exercise - pulling weeds is just as good as lifting weights.;
, These can be short term - kayak for an hour every other day, or finish weeding the side flower bed - or long term - take a week long kayaking camping trip, or turn your backyard into a tea garden for social events.
, You can start with 10 minutes every other day, and slowly build up to an hour a day, then two. Remember not to push yourself!

, If you've resolved to work out an hour every day, do it. Don't let anything stop you.

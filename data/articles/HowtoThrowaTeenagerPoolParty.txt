 a good idea is at your pool because you get more freedom!;
, teenagers don't like arranged activities but make sure there are things to do besides swimming, it is better to let them choose between 3-5 activities. some things to do are: sports, or volleyball in the pool!, movie inside, or even some contests!

, Don't make them too specific and the best time is around Friday after school-9 or so.
 chips, cupcakes, and ice cream are a must! a good idea is have somebody to grill burgers, hot dogs and maybe cook some pasta, another choice is order a lot of pizza! Teens are hungry all the time!

, If you want to save money, burn a couple CDs of your favorite songs and make sure to change the music after one is done! You can also make a big playlist on your iPod!

, Balloons are always a good idea and streamers are fun to! Make sure the house/pool looks amazing! Clean the pool and make it look spotless!

, It's your party too! Just be sure everyone is having a good time and know what you're doing and keep track of time!

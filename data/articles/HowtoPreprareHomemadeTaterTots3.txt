 Place a large stockpot on the stove over medium heat. Pour in the vegetable oil and wait a minute or so for it to heat., Drop the tots individually into the skillet, placing them about 1 inch (2.54 cm) apart. If the skillet isn’t large enough to fit all the tots, fry them in batches so that the skillet doesn’t get overcrowded., After the tots have fried for about 2 minutes, use a spatula to flip the tots over to the other side so that they cook evenly. The tots should be getting golden and start to look crispy., After about 3-4 minutes, the tots should be golden brown and crispy. Use a spatula to scoop the tots up and transfer them to two layers of paper towels to absorb excess oil. If you are baking the tots in batches, fry the rest of the tots., Let the tots sit on the paper towels for about 30 seconds, then serve while hot. Garnish with parsley if you wish and serve alongside ketchup, mayo or your favorite dips.

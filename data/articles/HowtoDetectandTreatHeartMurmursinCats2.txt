 High blood pressure, or hypertension, sometimes accompanies heart murmurs in adult cats. The vet will recommend a daily medication and suggest frequent checkups.If your cat is overweight, you should also ask the vet if they recommend any dietary changes, like switching from free feeding to scheduled meal times.
 Cardiomyopathy isn’t one specific condition, but is the name for any disease that affects the heart itself. An echocardiogram will help the vet identify a specific form of heart disease. After making an accurate diagnosis, they will recommend an appropriate medication, like a beta-blocker or a calcium-channel blocker., If your cat struggles to breathe or can’t move its hind legs, take it to the vet or emergency clinic immediately. Advanced cardiomyopathy can result in heart failure, so you should monitor your cat if it’s diagnosed with heart disease.Other symptoms can include cold ears and paws, and pale or bluish gums and eyes.
 If the vet finds a heart defect, ask them about its type and severity. Many minor congenital heart defects are tolerable and won’t make a major impact on a cat’s overall health. Larger deformities might require surgical treatment.Unfortunately, some defects are too severe for treatment.

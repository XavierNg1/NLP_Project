 While goofy gifts aren't the cornerstone of being the cool aunt or uncle, they certainly help. Buying your niece or nephew oddball presents help to give you personality and show you have a relatable sense of humor. , Even when buying something offbeat, try to make sure it ties back to their interests in some fashion. For example, if they're into fishing a talking wall-mounted bass could be a good fit, or if they're into comedy shows try getting them a collection of an old sketch show you enjoyed when you were younger. , Always keep your gifts, no matter how ridiculous, within the confines of their parent's values. Getting a gift that's too obscene or vulgar could easily confuse your niece and nephew while causing their parents to question your judgement - possibly restricting future opportunities to hang out with them.


Know their parent's morals so you can know which gifts are appropriate. Are their parents strict on movie and television ratings or subversive material? Then maybe you should avoid getting the Ren and Stimpy box set and go for some classic Mickey Mouse cartoons.
Try getting gifts that inspire hobbies, like a book of magic tricks, a crystal growing kit, or a do-it-yourself volcano.
Even better, make gifts with your niece or nephew. You can easily create interesting shapes out of clay, or make homemade slime, or craft a collage art project they can hang on their wall as a constant reminder of the fun they had with their aunt or uncle.

 Search for the specific item in the store. For instance, some coupons will say, "on any flavor or variety," while others will provide a specific list of items you can redeem the coupon with. Make sure that you give your coupons in the right order. Some coupons may render other coupons void, so make sure you've stacked them correctly.


If you have a coupon that has a required purchase amount, such as $5 off when you spend $50, give that one first. That way, any discounts you receive with additional coupons will not penalize you in reaching the necessary amount.Be sure to read the fine print. Some coupons may only be used after all coupons have been deducted.
If in doubt, ask your cashier for deals. He may have a value guide at the register or know of specific discounts on items you are about to purchase.
 To get the best value from your coupons, you need to avoid impulse buying and plan out what you will buy and when. If you avoid using coupons on full price items, are happy to switch brands according to what coupons you have, and don't just pick up anything that is on sale, you will set yourself up for the best savings.Know what you are going to buy before you go in store and try to stick to your plan.
If you have an opportunity to buy large quantities of non-perishable goods, make the most of it.
 If you are buying something online and have a discount code that you can apply to the purchase, be sure to have the code written down or saved somewhere accessible. Using the code is fairly straight-forward, but can vary from website to website. In most instances you will be prompted to enter any discount code you have when you fill in your payment details.


Pay close attention as the discount code box might be small or not immediately visible on screen.
Before you complete the purchase, be sure to check that the discount has been applied to the amount you are being charged.

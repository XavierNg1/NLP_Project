 If you want to build your muscles as big as possible then you want to focus mainly on longer tempos. If you want to be a strong, and fast athlete then you want to focus on shorter tempos.;
, This is an example - 1/0/1/0. The first 1 means that the weight is lowered in 1 second. The first zero means that there is no pause at the bottom. The second 1 means that the weight is lifted in 1 second, and the last 0 means there is no pause at the top.
 If you're a beginner looking to build big muscles then use a 3/0/1/0 tempo. If you're a beginner looking to build speed and strength, use a 1/0/1/0 tempo. After a while you may be using an even longer tempo for building muscle such as 4/1/4/1. And when you're really fast, you may be lifting weights and bringing them back down in less than a second.

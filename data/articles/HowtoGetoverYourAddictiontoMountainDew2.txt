 Make sure that you commit to following your new Mountain Dew drinking schedule once youâ€™ve put it into place.


Continue buying only a few bottles at a time and limiting your access to cold beverages.
Set aside a Mountain Dew budget. Only give yourself enough money each week to purchase two bottles of Mountain Dew. No extra money means you cannot impulse buy extra bottles.
 Regular exercise causes the body to feel good. Use the exercise high as a substitute to your Mountain Dew high.


More exercise can help decrease unhealthy cravings. This can make you more successful in overcoming unhealthy habits like drinking too much Mountain Dew., Ignoring physical cravings can be difficult. Keep friends and family around who will encourage you to stick with it.


Keep a running diary of your success on social media sites so that your friends can see it and give you encouragement, as well as positive feedback.

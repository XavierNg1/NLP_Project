 A good hug and a kind word will go a long way when your sibling is sad. Let them talk about their problems (or not talk about their problems!) and just show them that you're there for them by giving them a hug until they feel better.
 You can do nice things for them by doing what they ask you to do from time to time, or by doing randomly nice things for them, like making them breakfast or helping them clean their room.
 Give your siblings compliments when they do something cool or good. Tell them that they look nice from time to time or compliment their clothes. This can make them feel really good about themselves.
 When holidays or birthdays roll around, get them presents that are good for them, not just something really generic that anyone would get. Think about what reminds you of them or things that you've done together. Think about things they've said they liked or that they wanted. Think about the things that they'd need. This will help you get the perfect gift.
 Share what you have with your siblings. If they want to borrow your stuff, let them. If you get some candy, share it with them. Never do things like this expecting something in return. Do it because you want to be a good brother.
 If your sibling is traveling or lives somewhere else, or when you are older and have moved far apart, call them or visit them when you can to show them that you think about them. Don't let your relationship break down because of the distance but instead make it a strong connection that can cross any distance.

 Weekly vacuuming prevents dirt from building up. Use a high suction vacuum that does not have a brush. Berber is a looped carpet and a brush will snag and damage your carpet.If your vacuum has a brush, turn the brush off when vacuuming. Vacuums with a beater bar should also be avoided.
Vacuum up dirt as soon as you see it. If dirt sits on top of your carpet, it will eventually work itself into the loops of the carpet and it will be difficult to remove it., Simple things like removing your shoes when you enter your house or placing mats around doors and other high-traffic areas will go a long way in keeping your Berber carpet looking sharp. Do not allow eating and drinking in rooms that have Berber carpet.


Children and pets make keeping your Berber carpet more difficult as they are more likely to cause stains and snag the carpet. If possible, limit their time in the areas that have Berber carpet.You can also cover areas with large rugs or place blankets on the carpet when your children are playing on the floor.
If you have pets, keep their claws trimmed to avoid snagging your carpet., Berber is more stain resistant than other types of carpet. If you spill something on your carpet, you have an opportunity to take care of it before the substance penetrates the fibers of your carpet. Oils are much harder to remove from Berber carpet than other types of spillsbecause oil is easily absorbed by Berber.Time is the most important factor for preventing stains. If you can absorb the spill, you are much less likely to have a stain.
It is best to call a professional cleaner for an oil spill.

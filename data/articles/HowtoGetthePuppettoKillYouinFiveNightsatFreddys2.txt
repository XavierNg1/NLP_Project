 Don't leave it unless you hear another animatronic in your office and need to put on the Freddy Fazbear head.;
, Don't wind it up at all. Not even a little bit. It will make it take longer.
 Then don't wind it up.
 When you go back, turn your flashlight on. If you are lucky, you will see him coming out of the box. It's creepier in person than in a video.
 In the full version, you may see the endoskeleton come out of his box. This most likely won't happen in the demo. He can't hurt you, but The Puppet can.
 He is after you now. You almost certainly will not finish the game at this point. He is going to kill you.
 His scream is loud, like all the other jumpscare screams in FNAF.
, You experienced The Puppet's jumpscare!

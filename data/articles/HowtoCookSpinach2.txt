 Select a stockpot with a 6-quart (6-liter) capacity or more. The leaves should only reach the mid-point of the pot and should not rise much higher.
 Fill the stockpot with enough water to just cover the leaves. Make sure that there is at least 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 centimeters) of empty space in between the top of the water and the top rim of the pot to prevent the water from boiling over.
 Use around 1 to 2 teaspoons (4.8 to 9.5 grams) of salt. You want just enough salt to draw out the flavor of the spinach, but not so much salt that it dominates over the taste of the spinach.
 Once it begins to steam, start timing it. Boil the spinach for 3 to 5 minutes.
 Shake the drainer to remove any excess water.
 Allow it to sit in the ice water for 30 seconds to 1 minute. The ice water "shocks" the spinach, preventing it from losing its bright green color.
 Pour the contents of the second pot into a large pasta drainer and shake out excess water.

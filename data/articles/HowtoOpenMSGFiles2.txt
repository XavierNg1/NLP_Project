 Since MSG files are Outlook files, they normally need Outlook to open them. Luckily, there are several free programs available that you can use to view these files. One of the best options is MSGViewer, a simple open-source program that works for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can download the program for free from redeye.hoffer.cx/detail.php?id=13. No one profits from you downloading this program, and it contains no adware.
 MSGViewer comes in ZIP format, so you'll need to extract it before you can use it. Right-click on the ZIP file and select "Extract All" to create a new folder in the same location as the ZIP file.
 After extracting MSGViewer, open the folder that was just created and run the "MSGViewer.jar" file. This will start MSGViewer.


If you can't start MSGViewer, you may not have Java installed. Visit java.com/download to install the latest version. See Install Java for more details.
 This will immediately display the contents of the MSG file in the MSGViewer window, preserving the original formatting. Attachments will be displayed in the upper section of the window.

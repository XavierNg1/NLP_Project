 It is illegal to use someone’s password and username to access an online account. You may be committing identity theft and/or computer fraud.Accordingly, you should resist the temptation to access someone else’s phone records.


There are no exceptions to the law because you suspect your spouse is cheating on you or think your business partner is trying to steal money from you.
If you are convicted of computer fraud in the U.S., then you could go to prison for up to 20 years and pay a fine.A better strategy is to ask to have a conversation and explain what is bothering you. If you are afraid someone is cheating, then raise those concerns. Say, "Can we find some time to talk? I'm afraid we're growing apart."

, It’s also illegal to take someone’s mail and open it yourself. Stop yourself before you pinch someone’s phone records and review them. You could go to jail for five years for intentionally opening someone else’s mail.There is no exception because you live in the same apartment or house with the person or because you gave them the phone.
However, someone can give you permission to open their mail. Opening mail is illegal only when done without permission.
 Another way to find out who someone has been talking to is to look at their call logs. Most cell phones and smart phones store this information. You might be tempted to pick up someone’s phone and scroll through to see who they have been talking to.


Avoid taking someone’s phone, even for a brief period of time. You could be breaking multiple laws.

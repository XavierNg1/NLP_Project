 Secured credit cards help you rebuild your credit by allowing you to establish a consistent repayment history. They work like this: You load a certain amount of money onto the card (a security deposit) and that represents your spending limit. As you repay the amount you "charge" to the card, it becomes available for you again.


Shop around for the lowest fees and rates. There are two expenses associated with secured credit cards: an annual fee and an interest rate. Do your research to find the card that's most affordable for you.
Explore "hybrid" cards. Some cards are hybrids of a secured card and a regular credit card. They allow the borrower a credit limit that's higher than their security deposit. These cards typically come with high interest rates.
 Your payment history makes up 35% of your credit score, so on-time payments will help you build higher credit.Once you've established a positive credit history and improved your credit score, you're able to qualify and apply for one of the issuer's many unsecured cards., It can be very helpful for you both financially and emotionally to have someone on your side as you try to rebuild your credit. That's what credit counselors do. They offer services that include helping you to create a budget, negotiating with your creditors, creating a repayment plan, setting up a savings strategy to name a few; it all depends on your needs. Their goal is to help you eliminate debt and be financially secure.


Choose a reputable counselor. A professional credit counselor will be experienced and licensed in finance or a related field. Make sure they are part of a non-profit agency.
Investigate debt consolidation services thoroughly. While seeking a debt consolidating loan may be a good strategy for you, approach this option with caution. If an agency asks for an up-front fee to help you with this process or suggests you stop paying your loans and pay them instead to handle the consolidation, this should raise a red flag for you.

 Also pick your character and find out their combination to do the finisher.
 Once you've been defeated and the announcer says "finish him/her" try to press 5 random things before your opponent can finish you. It doesn't have to a hara-kiri, but you may get lucky and improve your timing attempting it.
 You need somebody that won't finish you off as soon as they can. Have a friend help or use the first couple of arcade computer opponents. Remember you have to be defeated to attempt this.
 Perform the hara-kiri and keep doing it until you get it right, this is the only way to get it right.

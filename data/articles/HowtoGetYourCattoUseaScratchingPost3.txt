 Cats have scent glands on the backs of their paws. The pads of their feet also produce sweat that has a unique scent. Cats often communicate by reading the smells around them.A cat will scent mark her territory to let other cats know she is around, to tell other cats when she was last there, and to make herself feel safe and secure.
 Cats like to scent mark vertical surfaces at or around nose height (to maximize the signal for other cats). They also like to scent mark entrances and exits because other cats may have to pass that way in order to get into the territory.
 Cats also scratch as a way to stretch their muscles. As cats scratch, they are stretching the muscles in their back and legs, which feels nice to them. It is similar to the way that we stretch in the morning or after sitting for a long time., Cats like to scratch surfaces that feel nice under their paws. That is why some cats will end up shredding a nice piece of furniture or an expensive rug. Scratching acts as a kind of stress reliever, so it is necessary for them to engage in it.Try to provide a substitute scratcher with a similar texture to your cat's preferred scratching surface.

 There are three variations:

The blade is held one-handed, out to the side, angled up and back. The off-hand is folded across the chest. The feet are evenly spaced.
The blade is held two-handed, above the head, angled upwards and slightly in. the dominant foot is placed forwards.
The handle is held two-handed at the waist, with the blade angled downwards and to the side. the feet are placed close together.;
, Dual blade Niman users are encouraged to use a shoto (short-bladed lightsaber) in their off hand. It is often studied as a prelude to Jar'kai, a non-mainstream form specifically for dual blades., These are the styles incorporated into Niman, so if you learn the absolute basics of each one, you should be OK., To compensate for it's relaxed bladework, Niman incorporates Force attacks into it's training. Although you (probably) can't use the Force in real life, you can still try stuff like pulling and shoving (or kicking - no big heavy boots please!) your opponents. The main two Niman Force attacks are:

Pushing slash - slash your opponent, then shove them away with the Force while they're disoriented.
Draw closer - pull your opponent into range with the Force, then hit them with your lightsaber.

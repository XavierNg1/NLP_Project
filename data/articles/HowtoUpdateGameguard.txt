This in the "Internet Options" section of the Control Panel.



Viruses can affect how GameGuard connects to its host server and whether it is able to update GameGuard automatically.



Not having administrative rights on your computer can prevent GameGuard's access request from initializing. If you never get the access request, you can't approve it and the automatic service to update GameGuard will not launch.



You can check to see if you have the most recent version by visiting http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=2da43d38-db71-4c1b-bc6a-9b6652cd92a3 and comparing the DirectX version to that installed on your computer.
See which version of DirectX is installed by running the dxdiag.exe program.



Visit the website for your graphic card's brand and search for drivers for your graphics card.
Alternatively, you can use the Device Manager in the Control Panel to check for updated drivers.



The GameGuard servers may simply be overloaded, especially following a large GameGuard patch.



This should only be done when the GameGuard installation proves to be corrupt through display of the error.
Make sure to back up your personal game folders before uninstalling and reinstalling, so you can copy back any personalized settings, key binds or macros.

 Get chips, popcorn, candy, etc. into bowls or baskets. Make sure these are on a small table and away from where you sleep. Don't have chocolate; it melts everywhere when you are all at the sleepover!

, You can get cherry tomatoes, small pieces of carrot and small pieces of potato (or any other small food such as fruit) and place on toothpicks for easy eating.

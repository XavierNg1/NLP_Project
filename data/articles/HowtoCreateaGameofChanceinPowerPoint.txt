 Create the title slide (your choice of title name). It might be something like: "Mike's Lottery of the Day" or "Felicia's Mini Bingo".;
, This slide is for explaining the "instructions". Include any instructions pertinent to the game of chance you're making. You can see the rules for the tutorial example of a fake lottery (without bets) printed inside the image here:

, Make level 1, then add other levels if desired. This step is optional; it may not work/be needed for your particular game of chance.
 Decide what/who wins in the level. For example, with a lottery, it'd be winning numbers that would decide the win. In a different type of game of chance, such as for children, it might be something like "the person with a red sweater" or "the person who remembered the most things on the picture", etc.
 Then make the transition that will reveal the win. Go to Animations>Transition to this slide>Advance slide "Automatically after". Then set it to 5 seconds. Uncheck "On mouse click". This will allow a timely automatic reveal of the winning answer or number.
 Decide how much "virtual money" or what "real prize" the player will win and state the winnings on the slide. For example, if it's a child's party, you might have a real toy or party favor for the child to collect.


Gold chocolate coins are another possible choice, to mimic money!

, Good luck playing it with your friends!

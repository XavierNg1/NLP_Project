 This easy, inexpensive method for making powdered detergent requires just three ingredients:


A bar of castile soap. Choose either unscented or buy a bar with your favorite scent, like lavender or lemon.
A box of washing soda. This is also called sodium carbonate or sodium ash, and is available in grocery stores.
A box of borax. This is a naturally occurring mineral that comes in powdered form, and is also available in grocery stores.;
, Stand it in a bowl and use a cheese grater to crate the entire bar. You can also put it in a food processor to grind it to a nice fine consistency. When you're finished, no large chunks should remain; you want it fine enough to mix with the other powders.
 Place them in a big bowl that you won't be using for food purposes, and mix them well with a spoon.
 If you used 3 cups of washing soda and 3 cups of borax, mix in 1 1/2 cups of grated soap - you get the picture!

, This is an optional step that you can choose if you wish to personalize your detergent to meet your family's needs. Baking soda helps freshen clothes that have heavy smells that need to be removed, and essential oils add an extra scent that you might enjoy. A few drops will suffice., If you tend to do extra large loads of laundry, plan on using 1/4 cup per load. For smaller loads, use 1/8 cup.

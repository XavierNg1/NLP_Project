, Place them one to two at a time on the wood on each side, and tape them down or clamp them to your workplace. If you wish, you may tape near the ends of the string instead of estimating the length from the nut to the bridge.
 You will need to get your fingers in between the strings, it is recommended you seat the strings 1 to 4 inches apart and stretch them so they do not touch the workplace underneath. Use your guitar neck as a reference.
 To do so, it is best to swab a drop of glue on your finger and rub it into your fingers with some water. It should feel like the same as liquefied soap, and have your towels ready.
 With the watered down glue on your fingers, coat the string as you would be using a handrail, but going back and forth to get an even coating. Once you have made 5-6 swipes, get all the droplets of glue off the string and wait for the glue to dry. Set up another workstation if you need to, and continue on until all of your selected strings are coated.
 You may sacrifice a little of your sound when you coat your strings, but it is a better outcome than dirt-filled, grimy, and rusted strings. If you so wish, coat the strings once again to have a different feel to the strings.

 Highlight the arrows in the weapons section of your inventory. Click on the arrows and a message will come up on the top of your screen saying "You cannot unequip this weapon while an action is taking place" (This may not be the exact message but it will be along these lines but there should be a message)

, After 3 seconds click on the arrows again and you will get the same message.
 When you close your journal the item should be duplicated how many times the number of arrows you have (so if you have 2 arrow sand drop a book you will have 2 books)

 Go shopping and decide which brand of stick deodorant and which fragrance is best for you.


If you are buying stick deodorant for work or playing sports, you might want to consider an unscented deodorant to avoid offending anybody with a strong fragrance.
Read the label to make sure you are not allergic to any ingredients.;
, Before applying the stick deodorant, either take a shower or wash your armpits thoroughly to freshen up. Dry with a towel so that the deodorant will roll onto your skin smoothly without smearing.
 Deodorant is known to streak on clothes, therefore, it is better to roll the deodorant under your armpit after you get dressed.


Although this might wrinkle your clothes a little bit that is more acceptable than walking around all day with white streaks on your shirt.
 As with most cosmetic products, deodorant containers come with a tight cap that requires you to unwind it or pull it off.
 There is often a special seal located under the cap and firmly on top of the deodorant stick that needs to be removed before use.


The actual deodorant stick is made from alcohol, which needs to remain moist. A tight plastic casting keeps the stick moist and avoids evaporation.
Sometimes you need to turn the dial on the bottom of the deodorant container until the plastic cap pops off.
 Apply the deodorant at the center of your armpit, working your way outward in all directions until your underarm is completely covered. Reapply throughout the day as needed.


Raise the deodorant stick high enough above the container so that you do not rub your skin up against the protective plastic covering.
Make it easy on yourself by using the opposite hand to apply the deodorant to each of your armpits.
 Otherwise the stick will dry up without the cap on and you will no longer be able to use it.

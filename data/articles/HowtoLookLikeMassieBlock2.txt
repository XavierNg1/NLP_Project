 Well-groomed eyebrows can make your pretty face totally stand out and help your makeup look just right. Bushy eyebrows - while not necessarily bad - aren't the best, but neither are over-plucked ones. For the best results, go to a salon to get them waxed or plucked.


If you are younger and getting your eyebrows done for the first time, try getting them plucked to avoid damaging your eyebrows.
If you want to pluck them at home, use good pair tweezers with slanted ends to get all the unnecessary hairs and be very careful not to damage your brows. It takes a while for the hairs to grow back.

It will help a lot by asking someone with experience with tweezers, such as your mom, big sister, experienced friend, or a beauty counter assistant. You should always pluck the hairs between your eyebrows and use some brow gel to get a clean finished look.
 It may hurt a little, but the hair won't grow back. However, keep in mind that you may have to get a few appointments set up because it takes about 3-5 sessions for it to work.
 It takes only a few minutes and has beautiful results that will last for weeks. It's also done by a professional to eliminate possible accidents that come with plucking and does not have the redness after waxing gives you.


How you choose to get your eyebrows done is your choice; either way, you'll get beautiful results!

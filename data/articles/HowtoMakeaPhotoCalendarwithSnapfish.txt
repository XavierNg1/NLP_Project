 You will need an account if you wish to upload photos and purchase products.;
, There should be a button that says upload once you have logged into your account. Choose pictures that you want to upload to make your calendar. If you want, you can choose pictures from an event or trip, or just any pictures you like. You can choose multiple pictures because most calendars can have multiple pictures on one page.
 Click "Calendar" and it will direct you to a page with different types of calendars. They all have different styles, but choose the one you want to make.
 There are different designs available. Some are for holidays, while others are solid colors or patterns. Choose one that you like, or would go well with the pictures. For example, if you are making a calendar with lots of summer photos, do not choose a background with Christmas designs.
 Remember that larger calendars will be more expensive than small ones. When you are done, click "create"

, Remember, you can only use pictures you have uploaded to Snapfish. If you need to upload more, you can now.
 Use the tabs at the bottom of the page to switch between layouts and backgrounds. Play around with different styles.
 To buy the calendar, click the button "add to cart"

, Click yes unless you are going to buy something else. Click yes on the checkout screen to buy the calendar. Enter your shipping and billing information to finish.

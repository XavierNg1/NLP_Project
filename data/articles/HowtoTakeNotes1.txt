 What type of notes you take and how you take them will partially depend on what the subject matter is. The format of the subject matter will also play a significant role in how you take your notes. Depending on the subject and format, you will also need to focus your attention to different types of information.


You may be taking notes from a lecture, during an assignment, or from a text. These formats each require you to work in certain ways. A lecture, for example, is fast paced and will require you to take notes quickly and efficiently.
Notes on the sciences will be very different than notes on the humanities. You might be taking notes on history, which will take on more of a narrative outline than notes on chemistry, which will focus on formulas and concepts.;
, Why you are taking your notes, your eventual goal, will also affect how you take your notes. It will play a part in determining what information you need to learn and what the most efficient way for you to learn it will be.


Test. If the material you are working with will eventually end up on a test, you will want to capture as much information as efficiently as possible. Focus on key terms, important events or facts, and broad concepts. Know the format of your test so that you can guess at the types of information that you need to know while studying.
Paper. If you’re taking notes that will be used to write a paper, you will want to focus on the types of information that you need. Take your notes to fill an outline of your paper or, if you don’t have an outline, look for themes and significant information.
 Taking notes has clear benefits. It will give you a guide for remembering information later but it will also help you to process the information. In having to think about what is important and how it should be organized, you will learn it much more efficiently. Studies have shown that students who work from broad notes do better on tests than those who rely on taking down everything verbatim.

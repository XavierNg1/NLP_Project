 If you're removing paint from an entire door or piece of furniture, using a heat gun may be worthwhile. If you only need to remove a few small spots, then other methods, like soap or alcohol, may be a more practical choice.


If you decide to use a heat gun and wish to buy one, they are relatively inexpensive and can be purchased at craft stores and hardware stores.
 You can char the wood, and even start a fire, if you use too high a setting. Read the safety instructions to be sure you know the proper way to use the heat gun.


Melting paint can also create harmful vapors, so be sure to wear protective gear like safety goggles and a mask or respirator., Hold it 3-4 inches (7-10 centimeters) away from the stain for about 10-20 seconds at a time. Try moving it in small circular motions to heat a larger area at once., While holding the heat gun with one hand, try to get under the stain with the edge of the knife. The paint should begin to soften and peel away. Clean off the putty knife as needed and continue scraping until all the paint is gone.


Turn off the heat gun any time you set it down to clean the putty knife.
 Wait until the wood is no longer hot, and wipe it with a damp cloth to remove any remaining residue. You can add some soap to the cloth for added cleaning power (see method above for full instructions).

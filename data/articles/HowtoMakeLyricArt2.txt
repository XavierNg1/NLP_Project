 To complete this project, you’ll need a picture frame, poster board, glue, scissors and different colored sheets of felt. Pick your favorite line from a song. Then trace the words onto the pieces of felt. Glue the letters in the correct order onto your poster board, then frame and hang the picture.Try to create some variety in the colors you use for each letter.
Shorter lines from songs generally work better. Try “Home is Wherever I’m With You” or “All the Single Ladies.”
To make your felt letters as uniform as possible, remember to use an alphabet template to create the letters.
 For this project, you’ll need black acrylic paint, small paint brushes and a white canvas. Freehand your favorite lyrics on the canvas using your paintbrush and being cognizant of spacing. After the art dries, hang it or prop it up against a wall. The bigger the canvas, the more impactful the art, but you can do this project with any size canvas.
If you have bad handwriting, ask a friend to paint the lyrics for you. You can also try using a stencil.
 For this project you’ll need a square canvas, 2 inch vinyl alphabet stickers, a small paintbrush and white acrylic wall paint. Once you’ve selected your song lyrics, position your stickers to spell out the lyrics on your canvas. Lightly brush your canvas with the paint. When the paint has dried, peel the letters off and hang the canvas.You can use a ruler to help center the letters or do it by hand for a more casual look.
If you need assistance peeling the letters off your canvas, use tweezers.
Double check to make sure you have all the letters you need before beginning to paint.

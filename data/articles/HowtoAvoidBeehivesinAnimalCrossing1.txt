 When faced against the wrath of a hundred annoyed bees, your best bet is to run. While you can’t run very far or fast enough to completely avoid them, this will save you a few seconds before complete and utter agony.


To run, press the B button while moving with your D-pad in all games, save for City Folk. In City Folk, press A and B at the same time so the character runs towards the cursor.;
, Bees don’t take sharp turns very well, and enough sharp turns will buy you time, so move in another direction abruptly while running.


Running in wide circles or changing directions are the best way to escape bees, as long as you don’t accidentally turn towards the bees.
 When you can, duck into the nearest indoor sanctuary. It could be your house or the town store—any building or structure that leads indoors would suffice. You can immediately exit it after ducking inside, because either way, the bees would disperse, leaving you safe from the dreaded hoard.

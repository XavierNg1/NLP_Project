 You’re going to be dealing with molten metal, so you better prepare yourself! You’ll need heat-safe gloves, boots, and an apron. It’s also recommended that you wear long sleeve wool clothing. Don’t forget your heat-safe facemask.
 Remember to keep the furnace running until you’re ready to pour the brass. As soon as you turn the gas off the brass will start cooling. , You generally don’t want to pour more than three molds per cast. By this point the brass will have cooled down too much. Transport the brass in the iron pan that you melted it in. Be very careful and pour the brass out using the spigot. Don’t rush.
 Depending on the size of your mold this will take an hour or more. Don’t be afraid to wait a little longer if it still looks molten to you. Brass generally cools pretty quickly. , Fill a large bucket with cold water. It doesn’t have to be freezing, but it should be colder than the lukewarm water coming from your faucet. There needs to be a stark heat difference. Now pour the cold water on your hot brass and the mold. Steer clear of steam. The heat difference should crack the mold right off leaving a still hot brass piece.
 You need to wait for the brass to cool thoroughly before using it. Even though you’ve already waited a while and poured water on it, it is still hot. If you don’t wait you might burn yourself. Let it sit overnight to be safe.
 Even if you waited overnight, it’s always best to use your heat-safe gloves when you touch the metal. The brass piece should be easily removable if you cold bathed it correctly. , Whether it’s a doorknob or a collectible, it’s pretty cool that you just did that on your own. Good job!

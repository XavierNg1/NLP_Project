 Leather or rubber gloves usually work best since these materials are the hardest for cactus needles to pierce.;
, Place a strip of duct tape so that it runs in a straight line from the top of the cactus to the bottom without overlapping.
 Use a quick motion, but do not pull so hard or so fast that you cause the cactus to topple over. The tape should have removed many of the needles.
 Continue ripping out the needles using tape until enough needles have been removed for you to grab the cactus safely. You should still wear your gloves, however, since some of the needles may remain.
 The spines are the harder jagged points along the surface of the cactus where the needles grew from. Removing the spines decreases the risk of running across a stray needle, and it also makes it easier to juice the cactus since the hard spines contain no juice.


Steady the cactus with one hand.
Dig the knife or pliers into the cactus under each spine bud.
Gradually push up on the bud from underneath until it comes out.
 Each portion can be juiced, but both parts must be juiced differently. The pads are the flat "vegetable" or leaf part of the cactus while the pears are the rounded "fruit" of the plant. Cut the pads and pears away from the cactus using a sharp knife.

 The packaging that your eggs come in when you first buy them is also the best place for them to remain while in storage. The composite material of the carton prevents the eggshells from absorbing odors from the other items in the refrigerator. It also serves to keep them safely spaced and covered so that they wonâ€™t be cracked or crushed.Built-in refrigerator egg compartments often require you to dump all your eggs in unprotected, which can lead to big messes and wasted eggs.
Leaving the eggs in their original carton also ensures that the expiration date remains in plain sight.;
, Eggs are situated in the carton with the bulbous end on top for a reason. This keeps the yolk centered inside, which protects it from breaking. A balanced, intact yolk will taste fresher and yields better results when used in miscellaneous recipes.Avoid moving or repositioning eggs too much, as this may damage the yolk or the natural air pockets inside.
 Many people think stashing their eggs on the inside of the door is more convenient. However, the main body of the refrigerator is superior for preserving eggs because it allows them to maintain a more consistent temperature. To maximize their lifespan, keep your eggs at around 40 degrees F (7 degrees C) or cooler.Frequent opening and closing of the refrigerator makes for more rapid changes in temperature around the door.
Processed eggs should always be refrigerated, while it may be okay to store raw, freshly laid eggs at room temperature.

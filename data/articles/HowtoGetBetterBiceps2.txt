 In a standing barbell curl position, slide the bar upward against your body until it reaches your mid-chest level, which is about at high as youâ€™ll be able to lift it while keeping the bar in contact with your torso. Then lower the bar the same way, making sure it does not lose contact with your torso.Your elbows will move backward and your shoulders cannot assist in the movement.
 Chin ups work the back and biceps. To maximize the load on your biceps with each rep, start at a dead hang with your palms roughly six inches apart on the bar, and then lift past just your chin so that your upper chest comes in contact with the bar.The additional range of motion when lifting all the way to your chest increases the demand on your biceps.









Though harder with chin-ups, lowering yourself slowly back down to a dead hang versus letting gravity pull you back down will increase the effectiveness of each rep.
 This exercise is essentially a dumbbell hammer curl from a row position. To perform, place your right knee on a flat bench with your left foot firmly on the ground to the side. Lean over so that your back is both straight and parallel to the floor. Then brace with your right hand against the bench. Lift the dumbbell with your left hand in the hammer position (with your palm facing toward your body). Initially let your arm hang straight down, and then simultaneously bring your arm up at the elbow as you also curl the dumbbell toward your pecks before lowering it again.Switch position to work the other arm.









This position should allow you to lift more weight than with a standard hammer curl because you also place a lot of the demand on your upper back muscles.

, Navigate through your software program's interface to choose a style or theme for your slides. Search your program's Help section or manufacturer's website to find how to get to the styles or themes for the particular version of your software.You may be able to preview how different themes would look on one of your slides by resting your cursor over a provided thumbnail for each theme., Experiment with the settings or options in your software program to modify your slide show.

Use these effects sparingly and based on your audience.
 Always save when you are finished creating the slideshow. You can always go back and add images or edit items later. Save the presentation to a flash drive if you have access to a computer where you plan to present the slideshow.

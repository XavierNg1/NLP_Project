 You can buy a water bowl from your local pet store or make one yourself. Bearded dragons sometimes like to take baths in their water bowls, so make sure that it’s large enough for that.The water bowl should have sides that are low enough for the bearded dragon to be able to get into and out of the the water dish.
If making your own bowl, you can use the plastic container from a frozen dinner, which is the perfect size.;
, Once you’ve filled the bowl with water, add something that will entice the dragon to drink from it. Good choices are natural fruit juices, such as apple or pear juice. Add just enough juice to flavor the water and make it tasty.Make sure the juice is 100% juice and doesn’t have added sugars or artificial ingredients.
You can experiment with different juices if the dragon doesn’t seem to like your first choice.
 The sweet smell of the juice should lure the dragon to the water bowl. If it doesn’t, you can try adding a bit more juice to make the smell stronger.Make sure to replace the water and juice regularly, as dragons may defecate into the water even if they haven’t drunk from it.
Replace with a juice and water mixture after cleaning the water dish if the dragon still hasn’t drank from it.
 Once the dragon has realized that it can satisfy its thirst with the bowl, it will know to go there when it’s thirsty. From now on you can fill the bowl up with only water.Keep an eye on your dragon to make sure that it is in fact drinking.
Bearded dragons don’t need very much water, so it may be hard to catch them drinking.
A bearded dragon's water dish needs to be cleaned everyday, since they will often defecate in their bowls.

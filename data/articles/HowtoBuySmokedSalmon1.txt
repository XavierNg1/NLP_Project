Wet cured, or brined, salmon is the process by which salmon (usually the fillet) is immersed in a combination of water, spices, sugar, salt and possibly sodium nitrite (to preserve the color) for several days. This allows the cells of the flesh to fill with moisture, so that the smoking process doesn't leech out all the moisture. Wet cured smoked salmon is moist and flavorful.;

The method of dry curing salmon prior to smoking is how it was traditionally done in Europe. The salmon fillets are fully covered in a combination of sugar, salt and spices. Dry cured and smoked salmon tends to be drier and silkier than wet cured salmon. Dry cured salmon is typically made in smaller batches and tends to be the more expensive of the cured smoked salmon.


Salmon fillets that are injected prior to smoking cure the fastest of the 3 options, but injecting brine into the delicate flesh of the salmon can damage it. The result is a cheaper, but more easily mass produced, cured salmon ready for smoking.

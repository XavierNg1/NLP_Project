 Just like with the letter, it's best to use professional letterhead if you have it. A pre-printed envelope looks more polished and authoritative than just a handwritten or even a typed envelope.If you don't have a letterhead envelope, place your address in the upper left-hand corner, starting with your name on the first line, followed by the rest of the address on the next lines:
Ms. Rebecca Johnson
Muddy River High School
492 West Lane
Big City, Arkansas 73234

, The recipient's address should go over to the right on the envelope, centered from top to bottom. Start with the recipient's name. If you don't know the person's name, start with the office, such as the Office of Admissions, followed by the school's name and the rest of the address on the next lines.The address should look like the following example: Dr. Jordan Jones
Office of Admissions
College of the Pines
2948 Northlake Boulevard
Big Buck City, Oregon 42343

, Often, a school will require you to seal and sign the envelope to verify that you wrote it. That just means that you sign it over the sealed edge of the envelope before sending it or giving it to the student to send., Know the deadline for the letter, and make sure you send it in on time or give it to the student. Missing the deadline could mean the student will be rejected for that school.Some schools will allow you to fax or email the letter. Check with the student to see if that's appropriate.

 Add details, a background, and other things that will make it more interesting. Remember that the more detailed the animated object is, the harder it will be to animate. Save the picture!;
, Open a new page in MS Paint and paste it in. Erase the stick figure (replacing the background that you also erased) and draw in a new stick figure slightly different from the first. Make him move by moving his leg slightly like he is walking. Repeat.
 Set each one up to play for 1 second or less.
, This is important. If you do not save it will ruin all your hard work, and you're done!

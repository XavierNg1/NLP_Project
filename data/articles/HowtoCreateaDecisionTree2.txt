 Begin your decision tree by drawing a circle, or box if you prefer, on 1 edge of your paper. Label it to represent the most important variable in your decision tree.When buying a work vehicle, you might draw a circle on the left edge of your paper and label it "price."

, Make at least 2, but preferably no more than 4, lines leading out from the first variable. Label each line to represent an option or range of options derived from that variable.


From your "price" circle, you could draw 3 arrows labeled "under $10,000," "$10,000 to $20,000" and "over $20,000."

, These represent the next priority on your list of variables. Draw lines radiating from those circles representing the next set of options. In many cases, the specific options will be different for each box, based on the parameters chosen from your first decision.In this example, each box would read "fuel efficiency." Because less expensive cars often have lower gas mileage, your 2 to 4 choices from each fuel efficiency circle would represent a different range.
 Keep adding to your flowchart until you've reached the end of your decision matrix.


It's common to come up with additional variables while you're creating your decision tree. In some cases, these will apply to only 1 "branch" of your tree. In others, it will apply to all branches.

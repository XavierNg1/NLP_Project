 There is no chance in hell you will kill a Thug using just your bear hands and feet. The most effective weapons are:


Guns - Pistols, Auto rifles and shotguns work well.
Knives - The best would be the Machete.;
,,, When you see the Thug, try to shepherd him away from the rest of the normal zombies. That way, you have more chance of survival. When they are all killed, approach the Thug by going to his back (Thugs are extremely slow movers) and kicking him. Repeat for about 5-6 strikes until his health bar is 1/4 down. Then, break out your weapon (See step 1) and stab in quick, sharp bursts. Don't stay there too long, or else the Thug will swing his arms and catapult you, taking out a lot of health. Instead, just run towards him, stab, then retreat. This is a slow method, but it works! A quicker way would obviously be the gun, but remember, aim for the head.

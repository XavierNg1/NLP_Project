 Discard one half and position the paper on a flat surface in front of you so that its long sides form the top and bottom of the rectangle. This will be the template for the calendar pages.;
, Make each line 5 inches long and 3/4 inch from the left and right sides of the paper respectively. Draw a line 7 inches long to connect the two lines at the top. This is the box where you will make the calendar days.
 These represent the weeks of the month. Draw lines dividing each row into 7 columns, each 1 inch wide, to represent each day of the week.
 This is where you will put the days of the month, but do not do this yet.
 This is where you'll write the name of each month, but do not do this yet. Write the three-letter abbreviation for each day of the week above its respective column and beneath this line.
 Cut each copy to the same size as the template.
 Stack the 12 copies together facing the same way and put a 3/4-inch loose-leaf ring through each hole.
 Decorate each page if you wish.
 Write "January" at the top of the first calendar month and place a "1" in the top left corner of the appropriate day in the first week. Continue labeling the days in order throughout the calendar.
 Write these either at the top of the square or at the bottom, but not across the center. Reserve the center of each square for your own additions, such as to-do items or birthdays.
 Place the easel on a table in plain view for easy reference.

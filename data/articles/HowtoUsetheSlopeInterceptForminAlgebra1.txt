 Before you can move forward, you need to carefully read the problem to understand what is being asked of you. Read the following problem: Your bank account increases linearly each week. If after 20 weeks of work, your bank account is at $560, while after 21 weeks of work it is at $585, find a way to express the relationship between how much money you've earned and how many weeks you've worked in slope-intercept form.;
, You should write y = mx + b and know that "m" represents the change and "b" represents a starting point, where the line "intersects" the y-axis. Notice that the problem states, "Your bank account increases linearly each week," meaning that you are saving the same amount of money each time, which means it will have a smooth slope. That "smooth," uniformly consistent savings plan makes it linear. If you don't save the same amount all the time, then it is not linear.
 To find the slope, you have to find the rate of change. If you started with $560 and now have $585 the next week, then you have earned $25 after 1 week of work. You can figure this out by subtracting $560 from $585. $585-$560 = $25.
 To find the y-intercept, or the "b" in y = mx + b, you'll need to find the starting point of the problem (where it intersects the y-axis. This means you need to know how much money you started with in your account. If you had $560 after 20 weeks of work, and you know that you earn $25 after every week of work, then you can multiply 20 x 25 to figure out how much money you earned in those 20 weeks. 20 x 25 = 500, which means that you earned $500 in those weeks.


Since you have $560 after 20 weeks and have earned $500, you can figure out how much you started with by subtracting 500 from 560. 560 - 500 = 60.
Therefore, your "b," or your starting point, is 60.
 Now that you know the slope, m, is 25, (25 dollars earned per 1 week), and the intercept, b, is 60, you can plug them into the equation:


y = mx + b (fill in some of the "blanks" with info)
y = 25x + 60

, In this equation, "y" represents the amount of money earned, and "x" represents the amount of weeks you've worked. Try plugging a different number of weeks into the equation to see how much money you've earned after a certain amount of weeks. Try two examples:


How much money have you earned after 10 weeks? Plug "10" into the "x" in the equation to find out.

y = 25x + 60 =
y = 25(10) + 60 =
y = 250 + 60 =
y = 310. After 10 weeks, you've made $310.


How many weeks would you have to work to earn 800 dollars? Plug "800" into the "y" variable of the equation to get the "x".

y = 25x + 60 =
800 = 25x + 60 =
800 - 60 =
25x = 740 =
25x/25 = 740/25 =
x = 29.6. You can earn 800 dollars in almost 30 weeks.

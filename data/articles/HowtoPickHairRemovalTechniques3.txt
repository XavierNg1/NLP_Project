Waxing and sugaring both cost similar amounts and last for the same amount of time.
 Very fine facial hairs are often hard to remove through waxing because they’re so difficult to grip. Threading is the ideal solution for people looking to remove very fine hair from their eyebrow and upper lip areas.Threading can sometimes cause irritation and redness on facial skin.
If you don’t want to thread, alternate using hair removal cream every few weeks with some selective tweezing., Retinoids cause skin to become prone to peeling and burning, thereby making your waxing trip a nightmarish experience. If you are currently taking retinoids, opt to remove your body hair by shaving or threading instead.Wait until you’re off your retinoid for at least 10 days before scheduling a wax appointment.
Also avoid getting waxed if you are taking Accutane.

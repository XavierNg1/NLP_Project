, Make it look good! You can choose premade layouts or make your own. Just be original and different from the other members. Stand out!

 The more friends you have,the more popular you are. Write something on their profile, introduce yourself. Just chat with them so they would keep coming back to you.
 You can occasionally earn "tagged money",and you can spend it to be a top 8 user for a limited time. This is really useful, because multiple people will notice you. The top members can be seen on the home page,and it costs 1000 tagged cash.

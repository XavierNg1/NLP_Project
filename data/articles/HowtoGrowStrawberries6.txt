 Place it next to the strawberry plant that is sending forth runners.
 Leave attached to the main plant and cover only a portion of the runner––the other side will need to stick out over the pot to keep its balance.
 During this time, water regularly, at the same time as the mother plant; this is to keep the soil moist and encourage root growth.
 After a month, cut the runner from the mother plant––use clean or sterilized garden snips to do this, so as to avoid introducing a disease at the cut site.

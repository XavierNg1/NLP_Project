 Organization and consistent routines will help you stay on top of your daily activities and projects. Buy a planner that has plenty of space to write daily notes.Before you go to bed, look at your calendar for the next day. Then you will know what to anticipate and what you need to get done.
 Thinking about the overall picture can be overwhelming. Break down a large project into small manageable pieces that can be accomplished readily.


Make a to-do list for each project. Then write down the steps that will accomplish the full project. Cross them off as you finish each one.
 Clutter can contribute to feeling overwhelmed and distracted. Reduce the amount of material sitting around on counters and shelves. Throw out junk mail right away, and get yourself removed from mailing lists for catalogs and credit card offers.Get online bank statements instead of paper copies.
 You may find yourself getting overwhelmed if you constantly have to look for your keys and wallet. Choose a spot where you will always put your keys, such as on a key hook by the door.

 Meanwhile, prepare two 6-oz (180-ml) ramekins by greasing them with the butter.You could spray the ramekins with cooking spray for a lighter alternative, if desired.






If you do not have ramekins, you can use any small oven-safe cooking dish of similar size. A jumbo muffin pan should work, for instance.
 Pour the cream into the ramekin first. Gently crack the eggshell on the side of the dish and drop the egg directly onto the cream.


Do not break the yolk and do not stir the egg and cream together.
Note that each ramekin should contain half the cream and two of the four eggs.
For presentation purposes, use a dinner spoon to carefully shift the yolks to the center of the dish.
 Lightly sprinkle these seasonings over the eggs in the ramekins but do not mix or stir them in.
 Place the eggs in your preheated oven and cook until the whites are set. Note that the yolks should still be soft, though.
 Remove the eggs from the oven and allow the to sit out briefly so that the internal temperature drops and the cooking process halts.

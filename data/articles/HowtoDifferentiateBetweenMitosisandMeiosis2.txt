 Meiotic replication is responsible for an organismâ€™s ability to reproduce. When an organism reproduces, it makes gametes. These cells do not have complete sets of DNA. They have half the number of chromosomes as cells produced in mitotic replication.For example, the meiotic sperm and egg cells each bring half a full set of chromosomes.
Pollen is a gamete. Like human gametes, it carries half the number of chromosomes as other plant cells.
 Synapsis describes the process that two chromosomal pairs use to share and exchange DNA. This process is a part of meiosis, but not a part of mitosis, so it should help you to distinguish the two processes.Synapsis is when two ends of chromosomes meet and share genetic information with each other. After the cells separate, the genetic information will be mingled in two of the four cells.
 In meiosis, the cell divides more than it does in mitosis. This is crucial to the production of gametes. Because gametes need to have half the number of chromosomes as normal cells, cells divide twice in meiotic reproduction. This means that each phase one might find in mitosis is found twice in meiosis:First, the DNA replicates, just like it does in mitosis.
Then, cell divides into two cells, which also looks the same as it does with mitosis.
Last, the two cells divide again. This third cell division is not present in mitosis, so it should help you to tell the difference between mitosis and meiosis.
 With meiotic cell division, there will be four, final daughter cells. This number is required to create cells that have half the number of chromosomes that the parent cells did. Without these chromosomes, the gametes would not be able to perform sexual reproduction.

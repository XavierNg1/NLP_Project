This will help kill the antsâ€™ pheromone trails and can discourage them from returning., Like vinegar, the acid in lemon juice can kill ants and eliminate pheromone trails. Add four tablespoons of lemon juice to an eight-ounce spray bottle. Spray the solution directly on the ants to kill them, and on entry-points and trails to discourage re-entry.

 Two-handed canasta otherwise plays by the same rules as 4-handed canasta, except for the following differences:


When drawing from the draw pile, a player takes 2 cards but discards only a single card.
A player must make 2 canastas before going out.
 Three-handed canasta may be played under the same rules as 4-handed canasta, or with the rule modifications described in the following step.
 However, each player draws 2 cards from the stock and discards 1, as in 2-handed canasta. Whichever player first takes the discard pile plays as the lone player, while the other 2 partner against him until the round ends. If no one can take the discard pile, each player scores separately. If a player goes out before the discard pile is taken, that player becomes the lone player and the other 2 become partners.


The lone player scores only his or her own total, while each partner in the partnership scores for any melds or canastas made as well as for any red 3s played, provided one of the partners has melded.
 Do not allow any player to go out before first making 2 Canastas. If someone is always winning, you may want to issue the other players a handicap.

 Decide which ice cream you want to be the bottom layer. Using the ice cream for your bottom layer, let the ice cream sit out for about 7mins whilst the others stay in the freezer. Make sure that the ice cream doesn't completely melt but is soft enough to spread.;
, Put the tin back in the freezer until it sets. Whilst the ice cream is still freezing, make sure that you have your goodies ready. Such has little chocolates are out ready to sprinkle and so on.
 Take the tin out after it has been set. Sprinkle one of your goodies onto the top of the bottom layer. Do the middle layer just like the bottom. Let it set and get your next batch of goodies ready for the top of the middle layer.
 Put the second one of your goodies onto the top of the middle layer.
 Put it back in the freezer to let it set. Get all of your extra goodies ready (if you have some extras) and place it on the top of the ice cream cake and put it back in the freezer until serving.

 As a babysitter your main responsibility is keeping the children and yourself safe. You should always be watching them and aware of where they are at all times.Some incidents are bound to happen and small scrapes and bumps are common for kids, but they shouldn’t be happening constantly and should be handled responsibly.
 If parents give you specific directions for how to go about doing certain things, such as feeding, bathing, and bedtime routines you should do as directed. For example, if they give instructions on what the kids should eat for dinner, you should stick to the options they provide.


Usually they are giving detailed instructions because this is how they want things done or they are the best options for you as a babysitter.
 A good babysitter won’t just supervise the children. You should interact and play with them as well. The more engaged you are with their games and activities the more fun they will have and you can build a positive connection with them., In order to ensure the children have a fun time and don’t get bored, it is a good idea to have some pre-planned activities and games.For example, you could plan a fun craft to create with the kids. This will also show their parents that you were actively engaged with their kids and the kids have something to show their parents.

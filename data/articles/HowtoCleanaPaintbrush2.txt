 Run the brush over a paper towel or a cloth to get rid of as much paint as possible.
 Use warm (but not hot) water. This solution will help loosen the paint from the brush, making it slip right off., Swish it around for several seconds, until you see the paint coming off. Swish for a few more seconds.
 Squeeze excess water from the bristles using a paper towel or rag.
 Let the bristles dry completely before storing your brush.

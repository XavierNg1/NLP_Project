 Before installing a doggie door, you should always consider the surrounding environment. For example, if you live in an area that gets snow, you may want to place the doggie door under a covered porch or patio. This way you will not have to worry about snow buildup blocking the doggie door. The covered porch will keep the area surrounding the door free from any snow., You should also consider the room of the house that the doggie door is attached to. For instance, you may not want the doggie door to enter into a formal carpeted living room. Your dog may enter the house with muddy paws, or track leaves and sticks into the house. Instead, consider installing a doggie door in a mudroom.If that is not possible, choose a room with tiled flooring.
Alternatively, you could place a mat in front of the door or separate the mudroom from the rest of the house using a gate. This way the dog will not be able to track dirt through the house.
 It is important that the ground is the same level on both sides of the door. In many instances, the flooring on the inside of your house will be higher than the ground outside. In these circumstances, you may need to build a step or ramp so that your dog can easily enter and exit the house.You can actually buy a pre-made doggie ramp online. They are sold at many of the same places as doggie doors.
 Doggie doors are convenient because they allow your dog to enter and exit the house of their own free will. This means that your dog will often be unsupervised outside. As a result, it is important to ensure that the outdoor environment is safe for your pet. For example, the yard should be fully fenced and secure so that your dog cannot escape.You will also want to make sure your dog has access to water and shade while outside.
Make sure there are no pesticides or toxic plants that your dog could ingest while in the yard.

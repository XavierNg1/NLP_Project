 Unhappy customers tend to vent to others. Their friends, family, colleagues, neighbors and strangers on message boards might hear your corporate name in a negative light if an unfair situation has gone unresolved. Minimize this possibility by having conscientious customer service personnel ready to assist customers.


Provide excellent customer service. The likelihood of spreading negative stories about your company is decreased when an unsatisfied customer immediately reaches a helpful customer service agent who offers empathy and offers to quickly and diligently resolve the matter. Teach customer service personnel effective problem-solving and conflict resolution techniques.
Extend your customer service hours. Be available to address questions and concerns, particularly after the launch of a new product or service that might contain glitches or require additional customer assistance.

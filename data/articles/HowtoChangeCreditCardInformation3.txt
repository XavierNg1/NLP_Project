 Credit card and identity thieves frequently pose as representatives of credit card companies to trick people into giving up sensitive information. This technique is known as "phishing." Only give out such information during calls that you initiate., Most office supply stores sell inexpensive cross-cut shredders. These turn documents into tiny scraps of paper, unlike strip-cut shredders, which turn documents into long strips of paper that a thief can potentially re-assemble. Use a cross-cut shredder to destroy anything with your credit card number on it., Don’t use the same password for everything and don’t use weak, easily-guessed passwords like “guest,” “password,” or your birthdate. Use a combination of letters, numbers, and special symbols like @, !, and $. Keep your passwords safe by using a password manager or by writing them down and keeping that piece of paper in a secure location., Don’t carry your card by itself in your pocket, where it might easily fall out or be stolen. Don’t leave your card exposed longer than necessary, as thieves might take a picture of it. If you carry your card in a purse, make sure your purse is zipped tight unless you’re removing something or placing something in it., Credit card thieves sometimes install machines that read your card information onto card readers at gas stations. These machines, known as “skimmers” then transmit that information to the thief. If anything looks strange about a gas station credit card reader to you, contact the clerk or manager of the gas station.

 When you meet someone, don't expect it to immediately develop into a meaningful relationship. Be patient. Allow some time to get to know one another.If you are uncomfortable about your weight, you should feel free to talk about it. For example, you might say "No, thanks. I don't feel like splitting desert. I'm trying to eat healthy."
Remember to be yourself. And remember that your date is there because he is interested in you.
 As you get to know each other, spend time learning about the things you have in common. Don't be afraid to share your likes and dislikes. For example, you could say, "I'm really into horror movies. Do you want to have a movie marathon with me next Friday?"Do things together. Activities are a great way to build a connection. Try something new together, like dance lessons or a cooking class. Learning is a great way to boost your confidence, too.
 When you're in the early stages of dating, try not to take things too seriously. Having fun is a key component to any healthy relationship. If you're not having fun with the guy, or if he makes you feel bad about yourself, it might be time to reconsider.Laugh together. Go to a comedy club or watch funny videos on YouTube.
Be playful. If you pass a playground, don't be afraid to take a turn on the swings.
 Communication is key in any relationship. To build your relationship, make sure that you effectively express yourself. Don't be afraid to share your feelings.For example, you could say, "I'd really rather not spend the day at the pool. I'm not feeling very confident these days. But I'm working on that. Can we find another way to spend the afternoon together?"
Be direct, honest, and respectful.

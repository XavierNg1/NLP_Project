 Cream cheese icing is especially popular on carrot cakes, but it also works well with chocolate, red velvet, or gingerbread cakes. Less sweet than a plain buttercream icing, it can be used on any cake or cookie to balance out the sugary taste with its own, rich flavor.
 Take 0.5 cups (120mL) butter or margarine and 1 cup (240mL) cream cheese. Soften them in the microwave or simply by cutting them into small chunks and leaving them at room temperature. Continue once the ingredients are soft but not melted.


You may replace half of the cream cheese with an equal amount butter if you prefer a taste closer to a normal buttercream frosting with some cream cheese flavor, rather than a mostly cream cheese taste.
Full fat cream cheese will create a good textured frosting. Low fat cream cheese might make the frosting runny., Use an electric mixer if possible, as this may become tedious and tiring if you do it by hand. Mix until there are no lumps and the entire mixture has the same color and texture.
 After the butter and cream cheese are nicely mixed, gradually add 2 cups (480mL) powdered sugar in 1/2 cup (120mL) increments, mixing thoroughly.
 Continue to mix the icing until it is light and fluffy. If you are not sure whether it's fluffy enough, stop; it's better to end up with slightly thick frosting than to beat it too much and make it runny.


If your frosting became runny, you can make it thicker by adding more cream cheese, mixing in a little more powdered sugar, or by trying out another thickening method.
 Add 1 tsp. (5mL) vanilla extract to the icing and mix it in briefly. It should no longer be visible, but there is no need to beat it for longer than thirty seconds. Your icing is now ready to spread onto your cake.

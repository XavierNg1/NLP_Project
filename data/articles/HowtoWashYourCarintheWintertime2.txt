 It is important that you wash your car regularly, especially during the winter months. Salt and other compounds used to melt snow and ice on the roads can cause damage to your car. Salt, in particular, can cause rust and corrosion if left untreated. Try washing your car every two weeks or at least twice each month., While it is important to keep up with regular car washes during the winter, it’s normal to get behind. However, it is extremely important that you wash the car as soon as possible after it comes into contact with salt or other ice-melting substances. This will help prevent rust and corrosion., It’s important that you are on top of fluid maintenance during the winter. Some fluids, like windshield wiper fluid, can freeze in the reservoir or on the windshield itself. Try swapping it for a wiper fluid that contains de-icing agents., Snow, salt, and moisture can wreak havoc on your car’s interior mats. Moisture can also seep under the mats and cause the car to rust. To protect your car’s frame and interior mats, replace your car’s interior mats with rubber ones during the winter.

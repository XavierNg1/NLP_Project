 Make the contours of the objects you’re drawing. Begin sketching loosely. Add a bit more pressure and shading to the areas that will be shadowed.Try practicing this technique for a still life, such as a few pieces of fruit.
 Color in your main color. For example, if you’re coloring an orange, give the body of the fruit its basic orange hue. Add a layer of darker color. Then apply the main color again.Hold your pencil as you would a regular pencil, or a bit farther away from the tip. See which way is the most comfortable for you.
Add accents after you’ve finished the main colors. For example, shades of brown and green for the blossom end of a fruit.
 Add texture and light or “shiny” areas with a white pencil. Use the white pencil in diagonal strokes to develop the background. Add more shadowing under your objects, if desired, with black and/or light blue.For example, define the pores of a lemon with bits of white.

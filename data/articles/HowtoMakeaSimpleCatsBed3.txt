 In less than 30 minutes you can create the perfect bed with just a needle and thread! If your cat loves to bask in the sun and watch life go on around them, then this is the perfect bed for them - safe, snuggly and simple.


Choose an old sweater or fleece jumper that will appeal to your cat.
Make sure it has long sleeves as this is what will make the cosy basket shape.
 You just need yarn and a tapestry needle.You can choose to use contrasting yarn (such as red yarn on a black jumper) or use the same color so it is invisible.


Stop when you have sewed approximately halfway down the sleeve from where the armpit meets the side seam.
Repeat this step for the other arm.
 Place the sleeves in front of it and roll the bottom of the sweater up. Make sure that the sleeve cuffs slightly overlap. This is how you will make an outer ring to your bed to stuff later.


Sew each sleeve to the top of the rolled up sweater edge.
Where the cuffs overlap in front, put one cuff inside the other and stitch down the outside cuff edge along the top layer.
You have now created a tube which you will later stuff.
 The stitching can be invisible or contrasting in keeping with how you chose to style your bed. When you make this running stitch make it arch a little as you sew across to make a half moon shape.


Make sure you sew through both layers of sweater fabric.
The more arched your shape, the rounder the bed will be.
 This is how you will make a solid yet squishy border to your bed so keep your cat safe and snug inside and keep their shape if it jumps in and out a lot.


Use old rags, stuffing or strips of old clothes to make it nice and full.
Pad the bottom of the bed a little and stitch the neck opening closed.

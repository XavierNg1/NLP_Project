 Choose a book with a binder that can be opened and shut, so that you can add pages.,, Choose protectors that can be clipped into your binder. The plastic covers will protect your recipes when there are spills in the kitchen.
 Write the recipes and shopping list directly onto the pages or print onto the scrapbook paper using your printer.
 By cutting slits in the pages and attaching the envelopes to the back of the page, you can hold your cards and take them out when you need them.

Place a mat or large straight edge beneath a page. Measure out several horizontal lines that are just slightly wider than your recipe cards. Use a utility knife to cut 1 to 5 slits into each page. Align the slits on the page.
Cut as many glassine envelopes as you have recipe cards. Measure them so that they are slightly smaller in height than your cards, approximately 2 inches (5 cm). This way, when the cards are inserted you will still be able to see the title of the recipe. Affix an envelope to the back of each page, just above the slot, with adhesive tape. One horizontal strip of tape on the back of the envelope and just above the slot will work well.
Repeat the process on each page that you want to have recipe cards. Check that each card slides into the slot and is easily removable.
 Frame photos on paper and glue them onto each page.
 For example, desserts, appetizers, main courses, soups and salads may all be in different sections. Decorate the divider page with photos and illustrations.
 Open the rings on the binder and place the pages in order.

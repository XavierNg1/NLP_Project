 Dogs are shy when confronted with things they do not understand. If the dog wasn't exposed to something as a puppy, their natural reaction is to be cautious around it as an adult. Also, dogs that associate an object with fear or punishment (such as a dog struck with an umbrella), may be shy or fearful of the object (an umbrella).Dogs may become shy because of unfamiliar people, certain situations, or objects. Often this is simply because of a lack of familiarity.
Shy behavior is commonly the result of poor socialization, insufficient guidance, or even past abuse.;
, Some behaviors in particular that are indicative of shyness include the four Fs: freeze, fight, flight, and fool around. The fight and flight behaviors are fairly straightforward, as they are the same as human response to fear. Freeze is simply when the dog freezes in place in reaction to a stressor. Fool around, however, can be more complicated, but it is similar to a person laughing nervously or fidgeting. In dogs, fooling around can be wild bursts of energy, jumping, pawing, etc.
 Most dogs are shy or lack confidence because of poor socialization as a puppy, rather than physical abuse. If, however, you suspect your dog has experienced abuse, you should meet with a certified behaviourist to assess and work with your dog.


If you are bringing a new dog home, some signs of abuse may be cuts, sores, etc. If the dog has been out of the abuser's care for a long time, you may not notice sores, but there may be scars.The dog's shyness itself could be a sign of prior abuse, but you may also see hostility, aggressiveness, illness, distress, or other signs of inadequate socialization.

 If you've adjusted the height of the float and your toilet is still low, you may need a whole new fill valve. In order to install the replacement valve, the toilet tank needs to be completely empty. Otherwise, you’ll have a mess on your hands when you try to remove the defective valve unit.Replacing a fill valve involves opening the hole at the base of the tank, which can cause whatever water is remaining in the tank to pour out onto the floor.
 To do this, you’ll need to unscrew the large nut and slide off any washers connecting the small water supply hose to the base of the toilet tank. Pull the hose out of the bottom of the valve, which should now be plainly exposed.You may need to use a wrench or pair of pliers to loosen the nut.
Lay down a towel in case any residual water leaks out of the detached water supply hose.
 Extract the entire fill valve unit, including the attached float. The unit should simply come out in one piece.Be careful not to accidentally damage or dislodge any of the other mechanisms inside the tank.
Discard the old valve, or consider having it repaired and keeping it on hand in case of an unforeseen leak.
 Fit the bottom portion of the valve through the hole in the base of the tank so that the rest of the unit sits upright. Then, reattach the water supply hose, slide the washers back into place and tighten the nut. Turn the water back on and give the toilet a test flush to ensure that the new valve is working properly.Make sure the hose, nut and washers are all tightened and secure before restoring water to the toilet.
Valves that make use of cylinder floats are less likely to experience mishaps than traditional ball-and-arm floats, which means you won’t have to replace your valve again for years.

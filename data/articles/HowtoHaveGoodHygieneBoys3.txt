 The best way to maintain good hygiene over a period is to make it a routine that you do every day. Alter your schedule so you are leaving enough time to take care of your hygiene.A simple morning routine would include waking up at 7 a.m. to brush your teeth, wash your face, and put on deodorant before going off to school.
Once you get home you could take a shower at 6 p.m. and brush and floss your teeth right before bed.
 Your body changes as you go through puberty and it means that different things are happening to you. As you go through puberty most people sweat more and their skin can get more oily. If you notice that you're sweating more, you can start applying underarm antiperspirant to reduce your sweating. If you notice that your face is oily, you can try washing it more regularly., Get into the habit of washing your hands after going to the bathroom, playing outside, or handling anything with bacteria. To prevent getting sick or spreading germs to the food you're eating, make sure to wash your hands before and after you eat as well.

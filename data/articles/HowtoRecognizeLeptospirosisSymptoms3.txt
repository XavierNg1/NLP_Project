 Many people can recover spontaneously, although it usually will take longer to recover without treatment. You should take into consideration any pre-existing conditions that can increase possible damage to your long term health.Pregnant women with leptospirosis infection have a higher infant mortality rate.
Unborn babies can become infected in utero.
Heart conditions, respiratory problems, or liver or kidney damage may be worsened if the infection develops into the second stage.
 For most people, the symptoms of leptospirosis will be mild, and the recovery period fairly short. However, should your infection develop into the second stage, symptoms could have major health impacts or even be life-threatening. Treatment can protect you from the more severe stage of infection.With treatment, infection and symptoms may last for a few days or for 3 weeks or longer.
Without treatment recovery may take several months.
Some people may be completely recovered after the initial infection, but some may not. Your doctor should monitor you during recovery, and for any return of infection symptoms.
 You may need to extend or change your course of antibiotic treatment if the infection is not responding to the medication., Antibiotics like doxycycline or azithromycin may be prescribed for milder, first phase infections.Doxycycline should not be used in the pregnant patient, this can cause liver problems and affect the development of the teeth in the unborn infant.
 For severe cases of infection and second phase infection, treatment may include hospital care for intravenous antibiotics (penicillin, doxycycline, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime) and rehydration treatments as well as antibiotics in pill or liquid forms.

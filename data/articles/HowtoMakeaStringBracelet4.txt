 Choose four different colors of embroidery thread and cut two pieces of each color to a length of 24 inches (61.0 cm) apiece (you will have two strings for every color.). Tie them in a knot at the top and braid the pieces 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) down, and knot the strings again. Then pin or tape the beginnings of the bracelet to your pant leg or a table top.
 Spread the strings out so that each of the two colors are lined up opposite each other in a mirror image. Then, take the string on the far left and fold it in half over the string directly to its right. The two strings should create a “4” shape; take the end from the first string and wrap it through the center of the “4” and pull the string upwards, creating a knot. Do this again on the same string so that you create two consecutive knots.
 Continue the pattern of tying double knots using a “4” shape across all the strings on the left until the first string has reached the center of the group.
 Take the string on the far right side; it should be the same color as the string you just brought to the center. Create a backwards “4” shape and tie double knots with it until you reach the middle of the bracelet, next to its pair. Then, tie the two strings in the middle together in a double knot.
 Work from the left to the center and then the right to the center using the same process as explained above. When a pair of strings the same color met in the middle, double knot them (otherwise you’ll end up with two separate striped bracelets).
 When you have added as much length as you need to wrap the chevron section of bracelet around your wrist, tie the remaining strings together in a knot. Then, add 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of braid to the end to create a secure end to tie the bracelet off with. Cut off any loose ends, and sport your new chevron bracelet on your own wrist or gift it to a friend!

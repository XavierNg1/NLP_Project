 Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid that has a wealth of health benefits, including the increased production of CREB protein in the body. Ask your doctor if butyrate supplements (available over the counter at pharmacies and health stores) are right for you. Alternatively, try to infuse butyrate into your diet naturally by increasing your consumption of high fiber vegetables and dairy fats (e.g. butter, heavy cream)., Consuming cinnamon may increase the body’s production of CREB protein, making it a subject of research surrounding diseases like Alzheimer’s. Cinnamon can be metabolized into a non-toxic form of sodium-benzoate, a chemical approved by the FDA to treat brain damage. Purchase cinnamon supplements from a pharmacy or health store, or introduce cinnamon into your everyday diet by:


Using cinnamon oil for cooking or baking
Drinking Cinnamon tea

Using cinnamon sugar

Baking cinnamon rolls, cinnamon french toast, or cinnamon coffee cake


, Blueberry extract has been shown to improve cognitive function and increase CREB protein activation on the body. The compound can be consumed in food form, or more easily in supplement form (i.e. pure blueberry extract powder or isolated anthocyanins derived from the extract). For the best results, aim to consume between 5.5 and 11g of blueberry extract per day, 500 to 1,000mg of isolated anthocyanins, or 60-120g of fresh berries.

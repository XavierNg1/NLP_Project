, If you're canceling within 30 days of activating service, you should not be charged an early termination fee. However, if you are under a contract with AT&T and cancel after the first 30 days of service, you may be charged the following:


$325, less $10 for every full month you have already completed of the contract term. This fee applies (as of November 2010) if, as part of the contract, you purchased a Netbook, iPhone, BlackBerry, HP iPaq Glisten, Garmin Nuvifone G60, Sony Ericsson Vivaz, Xperia X10, Samsung Captivate, Focus, Propel Pro or Jack, Palm Pixi Plus or Pre Plus, Motorola Backflip, Bravo, Flipout or Flipside, LG eXpo or Quantum, HTC Aria, PURE, Tilt2 or Surround, or Nokia E71X or Surge.
If your contract did not involve any of the equipment listed above, your cancellation fee will be $150, less $4 for each full month of the contract term already completed.
Per the AT&T Answer Center, your account cancellation doesn't take effect until the final day of the current billing cycle.
 The cancellation may not take effect until AT&T receives all equipment that was part of the contract. If you're not sure what you have to return, consult the original contract.

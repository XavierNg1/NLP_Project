 Once it does this, it will come towards you.
 Since it can fly, the arrows are the most effective.
 Get diamond armor and enchant it as best you can with an enchantment table. Get a diamond sword and enchant. Do this with a bow; you will only need one stack of arrows. Get a diamond pickaxe and two stacks of solid blocks. Take a piston and redstone torch. Also take some enchanted golden apples.
 Use your bow to strike the crystals on top of the obsidian poles. You will need to climb the other poles with iron bar cages with a pole of the solid blocks.
 The dragon will swoop down to the pedestal/portal and spit out ender acid. It may fire ender acid balls at you.
 Repeat until it is dead. It will explode and drop a lot of XP. Collect the XP.
 Make a rail around the whole thing., Behind the piston or beside it, place the redstone torch.
 Jump in the portal and read the story. If you don't want to, press Esc. If on Xbox, press B.
 Have a cake. You must have a cake.

 Scream at the top of your lungs. Kick the stranger very hard, and even roughly bite their hand if you need to, do whatever you possibly can to get away. Squirming helps, too! The stranger should drop you and run off, since strangers hate attention.


The stranger may try covering your mouth. If that does happen, keep screaming, and kick just as hard. Below are some suggestions on what you can scream:
"Let me go!"
"You're not my mom!"
"You're not my dad!"
"Stop!"
"Somebody, help me!"
"Call the police!"
Stranger Danger!;
, Tell the adult that you were grabbed by a stranger. The adult should contact emergency services immediately.
 Move your head from side to side to make it more painful.

 If your hot cocoa mix comes in a box, measure out 2 tablespoons. Adding the powder first will help it mix better when you add the milk, water, or coffee.;
, Put a candy cane in a plastic, resealable bag. Whack the candy with a hammer or rolling pin until it breaks into small pieces.


Try to use the kind of zippered bag you'd put into your freezer. It'll be more durable because it is made from thicker plastic.
 Unzip the plastic bag, and carefully tip the crushed candy into the mug. Consider saving a little bit to use as a garnish later.
 Any of the three will work. Water will give you the most basic cocoa, while milk will give you the richest. If you like coffee, you might like a peppermint mocha instead. Whatever you choose to use must be very hot or the powder won't dissolve well.


Heat water in a kettle or in the microwave (about 1 to 2 minutes). This will give you a lighter hot cocoa.
Heat milk in a saucepan or in the microwave(about 1 to 2 minutes). This will give you a richer, creamer hot cocoa.
Brew a cup of coffee if you want a peppermint mocha.For a richer peppermint mocha, add a splash of milk or half-and-half.
 Don't worry if you see the cocoa powder float to the top.
 Keep stirring until the cocoa powder and candy dissolve completely. You should not see any powdery clumps of cocoa or candy pieces.
 Add a swirl of whipped cream on top of the hot chocolate. For a pop of color, sprinkle some more crushed candy pieces on top. If you don't like whipped cream, plop in a few marshmallows instead.


If you have any extra candy canes, you can stick it into the hot chocolate, and use it to stir.

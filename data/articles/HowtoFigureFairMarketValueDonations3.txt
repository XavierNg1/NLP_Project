 If you are making several donations, or even a single donation consisting of many separate items, the IRS requires you to calculate the total value of similar items as one donation. For example, individual furniture items are generally valued in a range from $50 up to $1,000, depending on quality.Taken individually, this would not require an appraisal. However, if you are donating many items, the total may exceed $5,000. If so, you would need to get an appraisal of the items you are donating.For valuation purposes, you can categorize items into such groups as paintings, photographs, books, clothing, jewelry, furniture, electronic equipment, household appliances, toys, everyday kitchenware, china, crystal, or silver. The $5,000 limit would apply to each separate group.
 The IRS requires that you must get an appraisal no more than 60 days before the date of your donation. The appraiser must be someone who has been recognized by a professional organization or who conducts appraisals professionally.The appraiser will complete IRS Form 8283 for each group of donated items that value over $5,000.
 If possible, take photographs to help you substantiate the values that you place on your property. The IRS allows deductions only for property that is donated in good or usable shape. If your donation is questioned, photos can help you prove its condition. , When you file your tax return, submit IRS Form 8283 with your Form 1040. If you donated more than one group of items that exceed $5,000 in value, submit a separate Form 8283 for each group.

 If you are second guessing or doubting it, avoid it as much as possible. Don't be fooled by the many "free stuff" scams that exist out there on the internet today. Unfortunately, not every free stuff offer is what it appears to be. There are lots of great free stuff offers out there, but you need to use some healthy skepticism and resist the temptation to fall for free stuff scams and matrix programs.;
, Just take it as a given that spammers have nothing of value to offer, so when someone emails you offering something for free, chances are it's a scam. Variations of the advance fee scam like the email from Nigeria, saying they want to use your bank account to get money out of the country is on the rise. Just delete these without hesitation or a second thought.
 If you get an email or postal mail proclaiming that you are the winner of a great prize and all you have to do is pay a fee to claim it, don't. It's a scam and the only winners are the scammers.
 These offers are generally OK as long as the shipping and handling fees are reasonable and you get something of value. $4.95 for a CD-ROM you are interested in is fine, but $4.95 for a cell phone antenna booster (which does not work no matter what they tell you) is a waste of money.
 Most of the sites that consist of nothing but a form offering free stuff are there to collect email addresses for spammers. These sometimes have long lists of offers or "newsletters" you can subscribe to. If you are tempted to sign up for these, be sure to use a disposable email address. Check the credibility of all "FREE xxxx by completing our trial offers" websites you are considering participating in. Some of these sites are credible, some are not, it's important to get a feel for what has provided in the past and which sites simply forget their promises.

This is the time to make the pesto taste exactly the way you like it. Add a bit of salt and pepper. Taste the pesto and add more seasonings if needed.
Use right away or refrigerate. If you are not going to use the sauce immediately or if there is sauce left over, store it in the refrigerator. The pesto will keep for 4–5 days in a covered container., Put 6–8 cups (1.4–1.9 liters) water in a large pot. Put the pot on a burner turned to high. When the water is boiling, add the pasta and follow the directions on the box.
 When linguini is done, drain it well in a colander. Give the colander a shake to get any extra water out. Put the pasta in a large serving bowl.
 You can mix the sauce with the linguini before serving, or let everyone ladle their own pesto on their own pasta serving.

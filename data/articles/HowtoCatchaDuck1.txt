 Fill up a small bowl with wet or dry dog food and place it outside near where the duck typically stays. You can use dry food, or you can wet it a bit with water.If the duck is injured, it’s best to use wet dog food so the duck will get some water and avoid dehydration.
You can also put out a bowl of water for an injured duck to get rehydrated.;
, Find a place to hide where you can see the food bowl, but the duck will not be able to see you. Hide there with a net big enough to fit the duck.


A net with a handle will give you good leverage to be able to scoop up the duck without having to get too close.
Get a net with an opening greater than 1 foot in diameter. A large fishing net is a good option.
 While the duck is eating the dog food, quietly sneak up behind it. Make your movements quick but quiet because you need to get up to the duck before it’s done eating, but you don’t want the duck to hear you coming.


Keep the net hidden behind your back so the duck does not see it.
 When you get close enough to the duck for the net to reach, swiftly bring the net down over the duck.


Grasp the duck by the neck while it is in the net to gently lift it off the ground.
If the duck flies away before you can get the net out, try the method again the next day.
 Place the net on the ground and gently reach in to grasp the duck by the neck. Be careful not to pull the duck out with its wings tangled in the net. Gently work the net free from the duck's feet and wings to prevent injuring the duck.


While holding the duck by the neck you can safely place it in a carrier for transport, or release it in a new location.

 You never want to sound like you're just complaining. You should leave the meeting by offering a logical solution to the problem. You want to come off as helpful rather than negative.Remember to phrase your solution as a suggestion. You don't want your boss to think you're telling them what to do.
For example, "I suggest we hire a single temp. This won't eat up all of the extra money in our budget, so we can still put a chunk towards advertising. I would be happy to take the time to train the temp myself."

, You can always ask for a temporary trial run of your proposed solution. This way, your boss can see if your way is more effective without committing to anything longterm.Say something respectful when requesting your solution, and be specific.
For example, "We can try a very short term temp to see if this does increase productivity. Can we hire someone from a staffing agency for, say, two weeks and see how it goes?"

, The key to a productive discussion with your boss is continued respect. Remember that your boss is your boss, and has final authority. Make sure to leave the situation by mentioning this.End the conversation by saying something like, "Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I trust you'll make the right decision here."

, Remember, your boss may not admit they were wrong. They may not agree with your proposed solution, even if you approach them respectfully. Always accept your boss's decision, and don't push the issue once your boss has made up their mind.However, in some cases it's a bad idea to simply accept a decision. If your boss is doing something illegal, for example, you will want to look for another place of work. From there, you can report the illegal activity to the proper outlets.

 You can find it as a PDF file on the PTC’s website. Simply follow the link, and save a copy of the form to your computer.You can either print out a copy and fill it in by hand, or type into the form to provide the requested information. The form requires your name, driver’s license number, address, phone number, and email address. In addition, you’ll need to include the vehicle information, including the make, model, license plate number, and weight.You’ll also have to choose a replenishment option, such as automatic payment from your bank account, automatic payment from a credit or debit card, or manual replenishment with a check or cash, which requires a $10 deposit for the transponder.
As with the online application, you can add a second contact to the account, so another person is authorized to receive account information.
 Once the form is completed, you’ll need to send it back to the PTC. You can mail or fax it to the E-ZPass Customer Service Center. The mailing address is 7631 Derry Street, Harrisburg, PA, 17111, and the fax number is 717.565.4311., When you mail or fax your application, it takes a little longer to receive your E-ZPass transponder. You’ll likely receive it more quickly if you fax your form, but if you open an account with a mailed form, you may need to wait up to two weeks., Once you receive it, you’ll need to install the transponder, so it’s ready when you go through a toll. The type of transponder that you receive depends on the make of your vehicle. In most cases, you simply have to mount it in on the interior windshield behind the rear view mirror.Motorcycles require exterior transponders that install between the windscreen and instrument cowl. If you receive a bumper mount transponder, don’t try to install it inside your car; it’s only designed for mounting to the top of the front license plate holder.

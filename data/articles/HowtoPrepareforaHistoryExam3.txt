 Start studying early - it's hard to learn all you'll need to know in just one night. Look over your notes from each class session that night when you do your homework. You can study more intensely as the test approaches, but you’ll have a solid foundation and won’t have to cram., Do your best to get as clear an idea as possible of what the test will look like. Ask your teacher whether you should prepare for multiple choice questions, essays, or both.Multiple choice or fill in the blank tests stress memorization, so you’ll know that you should put your flashcards to good use.
If your test includes or is only made up of essays, you should be prepared to analyze a set of historical facts or compare and contrast two interpretations.
 Put yourself in your teacher’s shoes and try to come up with potential test questions. Practice writing essays and, to prep for multiple choice questions, have someone quiz you on your flashcards.Study groups are great for coming up with potential test questions, since everyone can make up a question and quiz each other.
 If you’re preparing for school exam, make and exchange practice tests with someone in your class, or have a family member test you. If you’re taking an AP History, SAT subject test, or other standardized exam, look for practice tests on CollegeBoard.org.You can also find exam tips, sample responses, and other useful resources on CollegeBoard. Just search for whichever standardized test you’ll be taking.
 Don’t stay up late cramming the night before the test. Try to go to bed on time, relax, and get a good night’s sleep. On the day of the test, have a full breakfast and, if the test is late in the day, a good lunch.  

If you feel like you need to study, just review your outlines and hard facts. Try to be confident and avoid overwhelming yourself or getting too nervous.

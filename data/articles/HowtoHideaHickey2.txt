 Whether you're a girl with a lot of makeup, or a guy who has to ask a girl for help or to do the walk of shame to the drugstore, it's important to have all of the right materials before you start covering your hickey up with makeup. Here's what you need to get the job done:Green corrector.
Purple corrector.
Concealer.
A make-up brush.
Foundation (optional).
 The trick is to apply the color opposite on the color wheel to balance out and neutralize the color of the hickey. The inside of your hickey will be purple while the outside will be more red, so you'll need to use yellow to color the inside of the hickey.


Apply the yellow corrector gently to the inside of the hickey, using a thin brush.
 Clean your brush and use it to apply the green corrector to the remaining red part of the hickey.
 Find a concealer that matches your skin tone and apply it over the hickey with your make-up brush. If you're not sure about which shade is best, first try using it on the other side of your neck to see if it blends in.


Once you've applied it with the brush, you can dab it with your fingers to set it into your skin.
Bring the make-up with you wherever you go so you can reapply it in case it smudges during the day.
To ensure that the makeup lasts as long as possible, apply a translucent powder on top of the concealer to lock it in place (if it looks too powdery, spray some setting spray on top).
 If you want extra coverage for your hickey, you can apply a layer of foundation to keep the hickey hidden.


Apply the foundation with a foundation brush and use a sponge to blend it in further.

, The American tendency to spread out with the arms and elbows is considered rude. People in Taiwan prefer their personal space-- it is even considered rude to take a bus seat facing someone rather than an open seat that faces forward. This applies to legs as well. Keep your feet on the ground, and do not cross your legs in an obtrusive way.
 Point and beckon with an open hand, with your palm facing toward the ground or to the side. Beckoning with an open palm to the sky is considered rude or bad luck.

 Greet them first, and always follow their cues-- if they do not put their hand out to shake, do not attempt to shake their hand. Put your right hand on top of your left fist and raise both hands to your chest. You can also bow.


Hierarchies are very important in Taiwan, and the elderly garner the most respect. Always pay attention to their needs and never invade their personal space unless asked.

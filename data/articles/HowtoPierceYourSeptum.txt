 You will need: A needle (pre sterile!), alcohol swabs, a curved barbell, and the correct type of clamp.;
, The needle should be sterile. Cannula needles (most often used in piercing parlours in the UK and in hospitals) usually arrive in an autoclave pouch. There is no safe way to sterilise needles or equipment at home without an autoclave, so only order autoclaved materials. Get an alcohol wipe and clean the inside of the nose on the cartilage you will pierce. Find the 'soft spot' which is located near the tip of the nose and where the cartilage is thinner.
 Unless you have a high pain tolerance you will need to numb your nose or else it will hurt more. Using ice is not an appropriate way to numb a septum, and using a hospital-grade numbing spray has a tendency to not work on septum piercings, even if held on the area for a long time.
 Septums are considered one of the most painful piercings, and if you hold the clamp down hard enough you may be able to numb some of the pain. With the clamp in place, put the needle through one side of the nose, and in one smooth and quick motion, push it through. If you used a cannula needle, remove the needle and keep the cannula inside the piercing, and trim to size. Hopefully you used a good needle, which is hollow. Place the jewellery inside the piercing however you have to depending on the needle you used.
 If you used a hollow point needle or cannula, as you pull the needle out you should have the one side of the barbell in your nose. Attach the other ball to the barbell immediately.

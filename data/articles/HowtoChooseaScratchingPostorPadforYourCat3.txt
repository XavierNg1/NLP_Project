 Don’t hide away the scratcher. Find a spot in the middle of the action and place it there. You want it in a place that your cat frequents as they will not usually go out of their way to find their post or pad.It is also a good idea to block off pieces of furniture that your cat targets by placing new posts or pads right before them. After a while, you can move the post away to a more preferred location. Just go slowly and don’t move the post more than half a foot per week., If you have multiple cats, you will need to get them at least one post each. This will allow each cat to have their own territory. If you have a multi-story house, then you will need at least one post per floor. It is also a good idea to vary the type of posts or pads, so that your cat can exercise a variety of muscles.Position a post near your cat's bed, as they like to scratch when they wake up. Consider placing other posts near door frames, as cats like to mark entrances and exits.
If you move, make sure to take along the old scratchers while providing new ones as well. This will help your cat to feel less anxiety and claim the new space., You can get a sachet of catnip and rub it all over the post or pad. You could also sprinkle catnip directly on the scratcher. This will help to lure your cat in. You could place a few treats around the perimeter of the scratcher as well., If the scratcher has a spot for you to attach a toy or feathers, make sure to do so. This will increase your cat’s positive association with the scratcher. You can also incorporate the scratcher into play sessions by hiding toys on top of it or dragging a feather over it., If your cat tries to scratch furniture, distract them from this behavior by clapping your hands or making other loud noises. Then, point them in the direction of the scratcher. After your cat uses the scratcher successfully, you might give them a treat or a quick rub.

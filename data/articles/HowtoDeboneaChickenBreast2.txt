 Check to make sure the skin doesn’t have quills or tears. You can pull quills out using tweezers or pliers. If the skin is torn, be careful as you work so you don’t enlarge the tear., If you are keeping the skin on, you need to find the bone by turning the chicken over, skin side down, rather than by cutting through it. Find the ends of the breastbone. You can start deboning from either end--whichever end has more bone visible from the outside., Slide your knife above the breastbone, between the bone and the meat. Work your knife as deeply along the bone as you can, pulling up on the meat with your other hand. Be careful not to slice through the meat!, Use your hands to pull the entire breast off the bone. You can use the knife to help, but pulling will prevent you from cutting through the skin. You should have an entire single breast with the skin on., Cut off any gristle, tendons, or excess folds of skin.

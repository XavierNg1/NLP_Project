 If you don't like the colors that pair with your eyes, try using your jewelry to bring out your eye color. Matching your jewelry to your eyes can draw attention to their color. Try to wear jewelry that is roughly the same color as your eyes.You do not have to find a perfect match, but something like an emerald necklace can help call attention to green eyes.
If you're not a big fan of jewelry, you can try wearing another accessory, such as a watch or cufflinks, that match your eyes.
 One great way to bring out the color of your eyes is to wear a tie that matches. If you have brown eyes, go for a brown tie, for example. A tie is a nice, subtle way to bring out your eyes without having a certain color overwhelm your outfit.This can be a great option if you prefer more neutral shades, like grays and blacks, but want people to notice your eyes. Instead of opting for a shirt to match your green eyes, you can simply wear a green tie.
This can also work if you dislike the types of colors that bring out your eyes. If you're not a fan of fuchsia, for example, instead of wearing that to bring out your blue eyes simply go for a blue tie.
 Hazel and brown eyes benefit from eyeliners that contrast with your natural shade. As hazel and brown eyes are darker, contrasting liners will make them look brighter by comparison.For hazel eyes, go for an eggplant liner.
For brown eyes, try a cobalt blue liner.
 Green and blue eyes often look best when brightened. Opt for lighter shades of eyeliner to make them look brighter, emphasizing the natural color. White and gray eyeliners can make blue and green eyes look bigger and bolder.

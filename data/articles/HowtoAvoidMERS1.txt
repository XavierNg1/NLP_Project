 If you live in one of these areas, you will inherently be at higher risk; however, if you live elsewhere and can avoid traveling to these places, you will diminish your risk and hopefully avoid contracting MERS.


Cases have also been reported in the following countries (in people who traveled to high risk areas in the Middle East): Algeria, Austria, Thailand, South Korea, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Hong Kong, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Tunisia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
If you are in a high-risk area in the Middle East, avoid contact with camels as they may also transmit the disease (transmission from camels to humans is possible).This includes avoiding eating camel meat, or consuming camel urine (which is considered a medicinal practice in certain areas of the world).
There are currently no travel restrictions to Middle Eastern countries where MERS is more prevalent; however, if you do travel there, practicing good hygiene and reporting any possible symptoms of MERS to a physician is important.;
, This is a general, hygienic precaution that should especially be followed by anyone visiting farms, markets, barns, or places where animals are present. Wash your hands before and after touching animals and do not touch any sick animals.Wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 – 30 seconds. Be sure to scrub the full surface area of your hand, including between your fingers.
If warm water and soap are not readily available for you during the day, another option is to carry an alcohol-based sanitizer in your pocket or in your purse.
While hand washing should always be practiced, it is important to note that MERS is spread by a respiratory droplet, as from someone coughing. It is highly unlikely you would catch MERS from touching a contaminated object, but rather from being in direct contact with fluids from an infected person., If you have been in contact with a sick person who coughed or sneezed on you and got a droplet on your hand, then putting your hands to your face can transfers the germs and increases your chances of catching the infection.

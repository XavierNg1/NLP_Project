 Take the room temperature butter and place it in a mixing bowl of a stand mixer, or a regular mixing bowl if you're using a hand mixer. Whip the butter until it's light and fluffy, which makes it easier to mix with other ingredients., Add the sugar to the mixing bowl. Whip it together with the butter until you have a creamy, fluffy mixture.
 With the mixer still running, pour in the vanilla and cream. Keep beating until the frosting is thick, but spreadable. Taste the frosting; if it needs more vanilla, add a bit.


A pinch of salt can provide a nice contrast to the sweet vanilla flavor.
Loosen the frosting by adding another teaspoon of cream if necessary.

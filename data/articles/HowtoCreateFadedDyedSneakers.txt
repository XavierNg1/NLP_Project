 The best way to achieve the faded dye look is to ensure your shoes are completely clean and are completely made of fabric. If you have faux (or real) leather running across any part of the shoe the project won’t work very well.


Remove the laces from the shoes and put aside (unless you plan to dye the laces the same color as the sneakers).





;
, Make sure the entire work area is protected because if the dye splashes or gets on the floor or countertop it will most likely stain.


Consider wearing old clothing or a smock/apron to avoid ruining your clothing.
 You can mix the dye either in an empty bucket or the sink (however the dye may stain the sink so using a bucket is recommended).
 Add jelly to the sides too if they are rubber to avoid having the dye leak onto that area.
 Hold one shoe in each hand and make sure shoes are lined up completely (so the toes and heels are lined up together).


Dip shoes up to where the lace holes begin (so just the top portion of the shoes) and remove from the dye.






Hold shoes in the dye for a few seconds and check to determine if you’ve achieved the color you desire.
 Begin at the top of the shoe and drag the cloth backward, pressing down into the shoe. You should see the dye follow in long streaks, beginning with a more vibrant color and then fading as you draw toward the back of the shoe.


Work quickly before the dye dries.
Consider asking a friend to help and you can each work on one shoe.

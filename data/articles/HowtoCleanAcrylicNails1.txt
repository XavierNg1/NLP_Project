 Set up a cleaning area near the sink. Make sure that you have a nail brush (available for purchase at most pharmacies and beauty supply stores, or online), a washcloth, anti-bacterial hand soap, and a clean towel ready. In a pinch, soft toothbrush will work in place of the nail brush., Wet the nail brush and apply antibacterial soap to it. Scrub underneath each acrylic nail, taking the time to remove any debris that might be stuck there. Rinse your hands thoroughly.
 After scrubbing under your nails, wipe down the surface to make sure they are clean. Wet a washcloth and gently wipe the top of your nails, focusing on the cuticles and areas surrounding your nails. Rinse your hands again.
 After cleaning your acrylic nails, make sure to dry them thoroughly using a clean towel. Excess moisture or humidity under nails can create an environment for bacteria to grow and thrive. To speed up the drying process, try using a blow dryer on the coolest setting.

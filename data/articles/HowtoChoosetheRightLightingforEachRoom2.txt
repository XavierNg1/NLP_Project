 Enhance your room's ambiance, dramatize wall textures, accent artwork, or just provide general illumination for your den, living room, family room, playrooms, or bedrooms. A variety of different types of lighting fixtures will work for both your general lighting and accent lighting needs.
 This is preferred because the light source is concealed. Close-to-ceiling fixtures, wall sconces, and interior lamps are also excellent choices and provide ample lighting. These fixtures are not only decorative pieces, but are ideal sources of task lighting for reading or playing games.

 Interior lamps are also a great choice.


When table space is limited, wall lamps are a good alternative.

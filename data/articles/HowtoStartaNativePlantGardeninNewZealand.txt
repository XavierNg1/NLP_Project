 Let the following natives take place of your usual lawn:
Mercury Bay weed (Dichondra repens) - native to New Zealand and numerous other countries



 



Dichondra brevifola







Pratia angulata - white flowering plant







Leptinella species - honey-scented





;
, Sandy mounds can easily be created in your garden using gravel covered with sand. This will replicate the conditions liked by many native ground cover plants and the plants will not require much watering or weeding. One plant suitable to grow on your mounds is Leptinella nana, a tiny cotula, which is quite endangered and would benefit greatly from you fostering it in your garden.
 The narrow strip running alongside your house and fence may seem "useless" to you but in many places, it offers a frost-free haven for a couple of frost tender native tree species. Clean the area up, add some ferns at ground level and consider planting two special deciduous natives down the side:

Aristotelia serrata, a local wineberry; and







Fuschia excorticata, the tree fuchsia (see photo accompanying article)







, This will allow the natives to take a stronger toehold and take over garden space previously occupied by non-native species. A little bit of effort up front will pay dividends in reduced maintenance down the track. Moreover, you will be contributing to the local biodiversity by creating homes and encouraging spaces for birds, lizards, butterflies and other species that make the most of native plants.

 Old, batteredÂ bottle caps work best.
 Give them a good rinse before you use them., In the game, the caps are over two centuries old; they aren't going to be pristine. Take a hammer and put a few dents on the edges and surfaces., Give it a good amount of scratches., A fair amount of results should show up. Print off a sheet of cap images., Cut slowly and carefully, making sure to cut in perfect circles., Apply a light amount of glue to the backs of the cap images. Stick them onto the tops of the caps., They should go all the way on the cap, with no gaps., Once they are, lightly scratch at the tops of the caps. Lightly, now. You want to give the paper that scratched look, but you don't want to tear it., You now have a stack of Nuka Cola caps. Don't spend it all in one place!

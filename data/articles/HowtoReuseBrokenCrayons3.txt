 Start by peeling the wrappers off the broken crayons. Then, place same colors with each other and chop them up into small pieces. Use scissors or a sharp knife to do this., Put ¼ cup of wax into the paper cup. The plain wax will form a base for the candle., Place the paper cup in the microwave and heat it up on low for 1 minute. Then, stir the wax with a popsicle stick. Microwave it again in 30 second intervals until the wax has melted completely., Carefully pour a thin layer of the wax in the bottom of the votive or glass jar. Put the candle wick in the center of the votive. Let the wick hang over the edge of the votive. You’ll snip them later.Use a thicker wick so it burns well.
If the candle wick does not stay up on its own, loop it around a popsicle stick and place the stick horizontally over the top of the votive to keep the wick in place.
 Fill the paper cup with ¼ cup wax and top it with the chopped crayon. Microwave it for two minutes and then in 30 second intervals until it has melted to form a colored wax., Let it cool for 30 seconds and then pour the colored wax into the votive, or glass jar. This will form the first layer of the candle.

Let the wax harden for 20 to 30 minutes.
If you want to add a scent to the candle, you can put 1 drop of lavender oil in the colored wax and stir to combine.
 Continue to combine the plain wax with the chopped crayons, melting them together in the microwave to create a colored wax. Pour the colored wax into the votives, layering them on top of each other.

Let each layer dry for 15 to 20 minutes before putting a new layer on.
 Once you have layered the candles as desired, use scissors to cut the wick so it sits just above the wax. Then, light the candles to try them out.

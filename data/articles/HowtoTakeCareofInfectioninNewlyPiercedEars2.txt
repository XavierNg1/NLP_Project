 As noted above, one common cause of infection following an ear piercing is the introduction of bacteria into the piercing via the wearer's hands. Though it's easy to absent-mindedly fool with your earrings while you're bored or daydreaming, try to avoid this type of behavior, especially if your hands haven't been recently washed. Doing so lessens the likelihood that you'll accidentally re-infect your piercing.
 If you're prone to piercing infections, you may want continue performing the cleaning routine above, albeit less frequently. When you're able to, clean the posts of your earrings and the area around each piercing with an antiseptic fluid before inserting your earrings to kill any bacteria that may be introduced into the piercing.
 Believe it or not, one of the causes of ear piercing infection is earrings worn too tightly! If the earring's clasp is applied too tightly, it can cut off the flow of air to the piercing, which, over time, can increase the risk of infection. To prevent this, simply wear your earrings loosely so that air can reach both sides of the piercing.
 For the same reason as above, you'll want to periodically give your piercings a chance to "rest" from wearing your earrings. Once the piercings have healed (for piercings in the lobe, this is usually about six weeks), take your earrings out every night before you sleep. Doing so ensures that air is able to reach your piercing, reducing the risk of infection.
 Certain types of metal used for earrings can irritate the skin or cause an allergic reaction in the skin. These problems can develop into full-blown infections if not addressed. For most people, irritation can be avoided by wearing earrings with posts made from neutral metals like 14-karat gold and stainless steel, which are unlikely to cause problems.


Avoid earrings made from nickel, which are notorious for causing allergic reactions.

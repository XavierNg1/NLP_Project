 Once you have gauged the interest of your coworker and you have developed a basic level of camaraderie, you can attempt to bring up the topic of the one-night stand.


Your opening line could go something like this: “Hey, I really like talking with you. Would you like to take this conversation back to my place?”
You can be more straightforward and ask, “Would you be interested in sleeping/having sex with me?”

, Be clear about what you want out of the affair. If it is simply a one-night stand that you are interested in, or if you are willing to consider the possibility of something more, be upfront about it. Let the person know your feelings and how you see the relationship developing in the future. An example of how you can approach this is by saying, “Before we go through with this, I would like to be clear about my feelings and expectations.”
This is also the time where you should discuss with your coworker privacy issues such disclosing details with other coworkers and posting things on Facebook about the affair.
 Once you have gotten to know your coworker and you are sure they are interested, arrange to meet them somewhere after work or on the weekend. To ensure privacy and your chances of success, meet at a bar or restaurant that you know your other coworkers do not frequent.

 Leave some space for a personal area (e.g. bookcase, ornaments, bed, TV, etc.) whilst making room for your computer.;
, Any computer will do, so long as you understand how it works.
 Make sure you have a fast web browser, a word processor, security systems, email, etc.
 This is to make your computer station look professional. Stuff like webcams, speakers, built-in microphones, photo-downloading equipment, a FLIP camera, and a good laser printer would do nicely. A wireless keyboard wouldn't be too bad either.
 Things like wastepaper baskets, pen cups, a stack of books, a tea coaster, a bowl of snacks, folders, phone books, etc.

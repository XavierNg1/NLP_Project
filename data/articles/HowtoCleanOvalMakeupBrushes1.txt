 Only wet the bristles of the brush. Avoid getting water into the area where the brush handle meets the head. This can loosen the glue that holds the bristles to the brush. Try dipping the bristles in a bowl of warm water to make sure that you don’t soak the handle.Fill your sink with warm water to dip the brush in if you don’t want to use a bowl.;
, Very gently swirl the wet surface of your brush against the soap. Use a very mild soap. After washing it, rinse the brush well with clean warm water.Clean the brush a second time if the water doesn’t run clean when you rinse it.
 This is best for brushes with synthetic bristles. Put a dab of liquid soap or baby shampoo in the palm of your hand. Swirl the wet brush against your palm. Add a little water if needed to create a good lather. Rinse the bristles of the brush in warm water.Repeat if the water doesn’t run clean when you rinse the brush.
Try this with dish soap or Woolite if your brushes are clogged with oil-based makeup.
For a deeper clean, put the liquid soap or baby shampoo on a microfiber cloth instead of in your palm and gently swirl the bristles against the cloth.

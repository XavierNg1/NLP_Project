 Use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to move the variable to one side and isolate it. Once you have isolated the variable, you have solved the inequality.
 When using algebra to solve the inequality, pay close attention whenever you multiply or divide. When you multiply or divide the inequality by a negative number, you must reverse the direction of the inequality sign.For example, to solve the inequality −5x>20{\displaystyle -5x>20}, you need to divide each side by −5{\displaystyle -5} to isolate the variable. Thus, you need to reverse the direction of the inequality sign:−5x>20{\displaystyle -5x>20}−5x−5>20−5{\displaystyle {\frac {-5x}{-5}}>{\frac {20}{-5}}}x<−4{\displaystyle x<-4}


, This is only the case if both sides are negative, or if both sides are positive.The reciprocal of a number is shown by x=1x{\displaystyle x={\frac {1}{x}}}.For example, to solve the inequality 6<1x{\displaystyle 6<{\frac {1}{x}}}, you would isolate the x{\displaystyle x} by taking the reciprocal of both sides. Since both sides are positive, you need to reverse the inequality sign:6<1x{\displaystyle 6<{\frac {1}{x}}}16>x{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}>x}

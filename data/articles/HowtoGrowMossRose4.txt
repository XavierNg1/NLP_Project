 Moss Roses will tolerate drought but try to water them regularly if you can. Simply watering them once a week should be enough for the plant. Use a watering can to water the base of the plant; try to avoid watering the foliage and flowers.Avoid using a hosepipe or sprinkler to water your rose, as these devices may damage the delicate flowers. Irrigation systems work well for Moss Roses as these systems water the roots of the plant, not the foliage.
Do not over-water your plants, as they do not grow well in waterlogged soil.
 An all-purpose fertilizer, or one for growing tomatoes, can be applied to this type of rose before it blooms. For store-bought bedding plant, apply this fertilizer just after planting.


Apply fertilizer to seed-grown plants when they grow to their full size.
These plants only require a small amount of fertilizer; too much fertilizer could keep these plants from flowering.
 Try to remove dead blooms once they wither (a process called deadheading), so that the plant has the energy to produce new blooms.


You can use your fingertips to pinch off dead flower heads.
 Moss Roses will keep blooming all summer and into the fall but by the height of summer they may become a little faded. If this happens, trim the plants back by about a third of their size and give the plant a light water-soluble fertilizer such as tomato feed.
 You may find your plants attract aphids. Control aphid attacks with an insecticide spray. You can also mix dish soap with water. Pour this mixture into a spray can and then spray it on your plants.


You can also hose your plants off with a high-pressure hose but this will usually be too strong for the delicate blooms of a Moss Rose. Only do this after blooming has ended.
Slugs and snails may also attack young plants. Control these pests by laying down pellets.

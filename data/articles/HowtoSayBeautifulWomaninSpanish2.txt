 Or tell a man that he is handsome/cute. Who knows, maybe you want to spread around the compliments! For a good looking male, you would use the phrase “guapo.” For a woman, "eres guapa" means “you’re pretty.” If you want to say someone is stunning, say, “eres deslumbrante.”


This is considered slang, and it’s more akin to calling someone “hot” in English, though. It’s pronounced “hwah-poh” or "hwah-pah."Remember, the word changes based on gender. So, if you want to say a woman is “hot,” you would use the word “guapa.” The same is true for most Spanish adjectives. The “o” ending is used with men; the “a” ending is used with women. You will find this usage in Spain also.
You might use this word in a phrase, such as “Hola guapa.” Or “Hola guapo,” which means, “hello, pretty” and “hello, handsome.”, Another word is bonito. You would change it to bonita when referring to a woman. It can also be used as an adjective to mean lovely or nice.If you say “chica bonita,” it means “beautiful girl” and is pronounced “cheek-ah boh-neat-ah.” This would be a more informal way to say the phrase.
You may hear Spanish-speakers mix this word with English, as in the phrase “Hey, bonita! How’s it’s going?” That means, “Hey, pretty woman! How’s it going?” Tienes una sonrisa muy bonita means “You have a beautiful smile.”, “Muchacha linda” means beautiful girl in Spanish.
Lindo or linda are also used as adjectives to refer to nouns that are not people. For example, "Me compró unas flores lindas" means, “He brought me some lovely flowers.” And "¡Qué vestido más lindo!" means “what a pretty dress.”

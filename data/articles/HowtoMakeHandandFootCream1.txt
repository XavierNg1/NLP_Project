 Place a saucepan filled with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water on the stove. Place a heat-safe, glass measuring cup into the water, then bring the water to a simmer.
 You will need 4 tablespoons (60 grams) of coconut oil, 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of shea butter, and 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of cocoa butter.

If you can't find one of the oils or butters, simply substitute it with what you already do have.
 Stir the oil and butters occasionally to help them melt more evenly. Once everything is melted and combined, use a potholder to remove the measuring cup from the water. Set it down onto a heat-safe surface, then wait about 10 minutes for it to cool., You will need 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of aloe vera juice and 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of a liquid oil. Great choices include jojoba and sweet almond. You can also use regular olive oil as well.

If you can't find aloe vera juice, you can try using aloe vera gel instead.
You will need to use this within three days. If you won't use it that fast, replace the aloe vera juice with another tablespoon (15 milliliters) of liquid oil.
 You don't have to do this, but it will make the cream more pleasant to use. Use your favorite type of fragrance. Lavender, rose, or peppermint are all great options., A jar that is able to hold 6 to 8 ounces (180 to 240 milliliters) would be ideal for this., This will take several hours. If you can't wait that long, you can speed up the process by placing the jar in the fridge. Keep in mind that if it is very warm where you live, the cream may never solidify and remain in a liquid state. In this case, store it in the fridge.

 Alcohol is known to cause restless and disturbed sleep. As well, eating a heavy meal right before bed can lead to restless sleep, causing snoring and constant moving or shifting in bed.Try to only drink water a few hours before bed and eat dinner several hours before bedtime. This will ensure your body has had time digest your food and is ready for a good sleep.
 To help you prepare for bed, do a relaxing activity like taking a long bath, reading a book, or having a quiet discussion with your partner. Winding down before bed will help you get comfortable and ease into sleep.


You may also want to have a warm beverage, like herbal tea, before bed. Avoid any beverages that contain caffeine, as this will only keep you up at night.
 Though you may begin your night sleeping on your back, you may want to consider rolling over to one side as you start to fall asleep or if you wake up in the middle of the night. Sleeping on your back can lead to snoring and restless sleep. If possible, try to roll to one side so your body is more comfortable and able to sustain a deep sleep throughout the night.

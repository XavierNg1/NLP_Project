 Most, if not all, point and shoot cameras or cell phone cameras don't.;
, There are good free ones and some good low cost ones.
, There should be a button on the back of your DSLR that will allow you to access it.
 Most DSLR cameras have that option. That way, you can be sure you got the shot until you are more comfortable dealing with your RAW file. There will be some difference. Your JPG file may actually appear to look better to you, but that is because it took away all the choices that shooting RAW affords you. It has already 'developed' that image.
 Depending on the camera, your files will be several megabytes. Otherwise, you will have to download, format, photograph, and download...repeatedly.


Be sure that your camera can support the size card that you are getting. Some cameras can only handle the smaller size of cards. The upside of this is, they are less expensive, so you can afford to buy multiple ones.
 After awhile, you will realize that you are wasting space by using both RAW and JPG files, and will switch to RAW.

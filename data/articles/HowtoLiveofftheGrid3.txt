 Growing your own food is the best way to survive off the grid. Even if you canâ€™t grow everything you want or need, you should at least be able to supplement your diet with fruits and vegetables raised with your own sweat and toil., Hunting, trapping, and fishing can provide protein for your diet. You could use either firearms or -- if you like a challenge -- you could use a hunting bow to procure wild game., Wild berry and fruit trees can offer an abundant source of ready-to-eat food during the summer and fall. Doing so can save you time, money, and energy.Obtain an illustrated botany book that explains which fruits, nuts, and berries grow naturally in your locale.
 Dumpster diving can yield substantial volumes of perfectly edible food. Identify grocery stores with accessible dumpsters. Using a headlamp and a pair of gloves, lean or jump into the dumpster and search for edible food. Avoid anything that looks or smells spoiled.Ensure that your local laws allow dumpster diving. In most jurisdictions, dumpster diving is legal, but some places frown on it.
The best time to dumpster dive is after dark when the store is closed.
In addition to food, you can often find hygiene products, electronics, toys, books, and many other perfectly usable goods in dumpsters.
Always leave the dumpster and the surrounding area in as neat and clean a conditions as you found it.

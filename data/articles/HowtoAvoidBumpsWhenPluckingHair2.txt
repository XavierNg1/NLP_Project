 The more often you remove hair, the more likely you are to cause skin irritation. This can lead to an increase of red bumps. Instead of removing hair every day, cut back to every two to three days.If you're plucking hairs exclusively, you probably do not need to remove hair every day anyway. Hairs that are removed with tweezers should not grow back for three to eight weeks., Red bumps may get infected if you're using dirty tools. Rub down your tweezers with rubbing alcohol prior to use. This will protect you from getting infected red bumps, which will be more visible., Regardless of where you're plucking, you should always pluck in the direction your hair grows. This will make the hair come off more easily, preventing red bumps., Tight fitting clothing, especially when worn just after plucking, can make red bumps more likely. Strive for loose clothes on the areas that you shave. For example, avoid tight jeans the day after you pluck your legs.If you pluck your pubic hair, try not wearing underwear for half an hour after the process. This can help prevent red bumps., If you have red hairs a lot after plucking, your skin may be sensitive to the process. Try switching up your hair removal technique and see if this lessens red bumps. You can try shaving or waxing instead of tweezing and see if makes a difference.Shaving should be done with shaving cream and you should always shave with the grain of the hair and not against it.
Hair removal creams and waxing kits should be used according to instructions. Most removal creams are placed on the area you want to remove hair and then wiped off. Waxing involves placing wax over unwanted hair and pulling it off with strips of paper.
Keep in mind, you should still moisturize skin regularly, as well as after hair removal techniques, regardless of the method you use. Make sure to get skin wet before removing hair.

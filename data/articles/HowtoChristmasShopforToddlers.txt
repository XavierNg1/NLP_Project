 You love your children and all, but you aren't going to spend a thousand dollars on a present for a 3-year-old. Pick a nice, simple limit that will make sure you don't spend too much.;
, Find out if they really like one thing nowadays, something that they obsess about, something silly, like Dora® or Hello Kitty®. If you are the parents, try to go "spy" on the child to see what he/she likes.
 For example, if they like Diego®, find a Diego pop-up book, or a shirt with Diego on it. There are millions of cheap, cute trinkets like this, all over the internet and in toy stores.
 Make sure that you've found what you needed and are completely satisfied. Be positive that you don't want to add anything else.
 Buy wrapping paper with cute designs, but not something too expensive that the toddler will not even notice. You could wrap in newspaper if you want to, and they would not even care.
 Toddlers love to investigate, so hide it somewhere smart and high. You don't want them to see your perfect gift before Christmas Day!

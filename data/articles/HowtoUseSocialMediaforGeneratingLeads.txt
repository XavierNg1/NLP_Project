 If your brand is engaged in social media marketing, then deliver your messages visually. This is what Hubspot suggested after their experiment showed that photo posts generate a 128% higher click-through rate and get 53% more Facebook Likes than videos and links., Of course, uploading attention-grabbing photos alone would be useless if the post doesn’t come with a link back to your website. This can be extra effective now that Facebook has removed its clause that prohibits brands from including calls-to-action in cover photo captions., The integration of links on your social media posts can increase traffic to your website. Your next task is to make sure that the page you direct users to is the most relevant and specific page of your website. Within the first few seconds of their visit on your site, they must be convinced that doing business with you is a good idea.
 Tagging another Facebook Page gives you an opportunity to widen your reach. And new brand Pages can benefit from their company Page if it already has a solid following. It works this way: the new Page with fewer followers or Likers can tag a more popular Page, and that post becomes visible to the followers of the bigger Page, allowing the new one to introduce itself to the popular Page’s fans.
 Question and answer sessions are a popular way for brands to engage broadly with their audience. To make the most out of this, include links to an article or a study published on your website when trying to explain a complex answer to your fans. This gives those requesting information relevant resources to go to and gives you a chance to convert visitors into customers.
 Use customizable parts of social networks to your advantage by building forms there. In this way, you can collect contact information from interested customers without disrupting their social networking experience, which is a downside of redirecting them to an outside form.

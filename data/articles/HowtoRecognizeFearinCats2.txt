 In a situation where a cat feels mildly threatened, she may become silent or begin to make a deep purring sounds. This may sound counter-intuitive, but some cats do purr when they are in pain or are scared in order to comfort themselves.It is thought that purring releases chemicals called endorphins, which have a comforting effect.
 As the threat intensifies, such as when a cat is confronted with an approaching dog, the cat will begin to hiss.


The cat will open her mouth and release a hissing noise that sounds almost like she is trying to get something out of the back of her throat.
 If the hiss does not put off whatever is making the cat uncomfortable, then the fearful cat will emit a series of long, slow exhalations to make a growling sound.


This is accompanied by snarls, which involve the cat retracting her lips to fully show her powerful canine teeth.
 The previous displays are designed as "distancing signals". The intention of these signals is to notify the aggressor that the cat is not happy, and is preparing to defend herself. If the thing that is making the cat uncomfortable is not dealt with, and the cat sees no escape route, then she may hiss, spit and, as a last resort, lash out with her claws extended.

 Cut 4 pieces of duct tape around 8 inches (around 20.3 centimeters) long. The thickness will vary depending on the amount of pieces you use. Eight pieces will make a bulkier bracelet, while four pieces will give you a thinner look.If you're unsure this size will fit, wrap another piece of 8 inch duct tape around your wrist with the adhesive side facing out. Decide if you want to increase or decrease this size.;
, Put the 4 duct tape pieces on top of each other, with the sticky part facing upward. You are creating the thick bulk of the bracelet., Fold over one side of the duct tape lengthwise so that the sticky part folds into sticky part. Do this to create a skinnier bracelet, but if you prefer a wider bracelet, donâ€™t create this fold.Cut out a strip of duct tape the same length as the bracelet, if you want to keep the bracelet wide. Apply the adhesive side of this strip to the other adhesive side of the bracelet.
 This will turn the duct tape pieces into the bracelet's shape. Use a piece of duct tape about 2 inches (around 5.1 centimeters) long attached over the opening to hold the ends together. Wrap the bracelet around your wrist to see if it fits. Use a longer strip to attach the two ends together if the bracelet feels too snug.

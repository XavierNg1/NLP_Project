 It would be nice if our ideas came in the best chronological order but typically they don't. Shift events around and experiment with different time frames.
 Writing the beginning and middle of a book is somewhat easier to approach sometimes and you are unbound in potential. By the end of your book though you will need something really good to seal the deal. It really does make the difference. Be sure to read your story like you've never read it before. Read the details, think like the reader. What does the reader think is interesting?

, Splash out on a new pad and pen and take it everywhere with you. Survey, interrogate and observe the people that are around you and write as much as possible every day, write about everything then go back and sift out interesting bits that can be used as starting points for ideas.

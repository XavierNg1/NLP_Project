 Captured leprechauns are said to give you three wishes and a gold coin. Leprechauns are tricksters. There are many Irish fables about people choosing wishes that backfire.For example, there was a man named Seamus from County Mayo who wanted to be the richest man on a tropical island. But he found himself alone on the island and ended up using his third wish to return to Ireland.
Leprechauns will trick you by twisting the mind. They are smart and will try to confuse you into making the wrong wishes. Don’t trust them because they are devious.
 Leprechauns are said to be part of a fairy world made up of little people and who are called the Luacharman. They are known as tiny shoemakers, cobblers for the fairy world. Sometimes they are called the "wee people."Leprechauns are connected to gold. It’s believed they watch the golden treasure left by Danish people who invaded Ireland more than 1,000 years ago. So if you catch one, according to legend, the leprechaun will have to tell you where the gold is hidden because he is compelled to tell the truth by fairy law.Look the leprechaun in the eye. According to Irish folklore, fairy law holds that Leprechauns must also be courteous. But if you look away from it, the leprechaun is freed from these rules and likely to vanish.
 This will help you catch them, and figure out what to do with them when you do. For one, leprechauns rarely travel in groups. They are solitary creatures.Leprechauns are male. They are said to be friends of the robin. They like to drink alcohol, which is one reason some leprechauns are evil. But they are generally harmless, if a bit mischievous. There is nothing to fear.
They are old-fashioned and a bit shabby. They don't like conformity so if you catch one it will probably have something like a green jacket and red pants. They wear tall hats and have shoes with big buckles on them.

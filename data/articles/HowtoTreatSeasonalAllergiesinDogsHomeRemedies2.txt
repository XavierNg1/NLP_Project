, Unlike Gold Bond, Coconut oil will not relieve an itch, but it will soothe irritated skin. Dogs tend to break skin when scratching.
 Coconut oil is safe for your pet, but we don't want them ingesting it. It won't help soothe their skin if they eat it, and if they ingest too much, it will give them diarrhea.

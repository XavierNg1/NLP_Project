 It is a dirt road located north of the Vinewood sign and south of the Redwood Lights Track.If the random event has been triggered, three red blips will appear on your radar as the rednecks start following and attacking you with sawed-off shotguns.;
, Two of them will be driving dirt bikes and one will be on an ATV, making them easier to shoot. If youâ€™re playing as Franklin, you can activate your special ability to slow down time and shoot them while driving to perform a drive-by.


Shooting from within your vehicle is your safest choice, as there is no available cover nearby. Your car cannot be reliably used as cover because they will be flanking you.
Running over them in your vehicle will also kill them, but it will likely take longer to kill them all that way.
It is possible to run away to end this random event, but it will not be considered complete., Walk over to them to pick up the ammo and cash they dropped. They will have dropped $600-$700.

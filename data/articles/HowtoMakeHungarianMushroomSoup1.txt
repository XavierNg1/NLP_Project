 Carefully chop a few onions in order to get 2 cups (300 g) of chopped onions. You should also heat 2 tablespoons of the chicken or vegetable stock in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onions and 12 ounces (340 g) of sliced mushrooms. Cook the vegetables until they soften.It will take 8 to 10 minutes for the onions and mushrooms to become tender.;
, Stir in 1 teaspoon of the dill weed, 1/2 cup (120 ml) of the chicken or vegetable stock, 1 tablespoon of Hungarian paprika, and 1 tablespoon of soy sauce. Cover the saute pan and turn the heat to medium-low. Let the soup bubble lightly for 15 minutes.Simmering the soup will help the flavors develop, so it's important to cook the soup for the full 15 minutes.
 Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add 3 tablespoons of flour all at once and quickly stir the flour into the melted butter. Keep stirring the roux while you cook it for a couple of minutes. Slowly whisk in 1 cup (240 ml) of milk. Keep whisking until the roux dissolves.The roux will help the soup thicken. If you get lumps in the soup, you can blitz the milk with an immersion blender to break up the lumps.
 Slowly stir the vegetable and onion mixture into the pot with the thickened milk. You should also stir in the remaining 1/2 cup (120 ml) of the chicken or vegetable stock. Put the lid on the soup and let the soup simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes.You can remove the lid and stir the soup every once in a while to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
 Remove the lid and stir in 1 teaspoon of salt, freshly ground black pepper (to taste), 2 teaspoons of lemon juice, and 1‚ÅÑ2 cup (115 g) of sour cream. Taste the soup and adjust the seasonings according to your preferences.You can stir in the remaining teaspoon of dill weed for a stronger flavor.
Garnish the soup with the 1/4 cup (5 g) of chopped fresh parsley.

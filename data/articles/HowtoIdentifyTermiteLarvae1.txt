 Larvae have soft bodies instead of a hard, outer shell. They have a distinct head from the rest of their body as well as six legs. Their antennae are straight.Termite larvae tend to look extremely similar to worker and nymph termites, except for their size. Larvae are much smaller than workers and nymphs.
Termites may resemble ants, but where ants’ bodies have a narrow waist, termites’ bodies are smooth and straight. Termites also have straight antennae where ants have bent antennae.;
, Termite larvae tend to be white and almost translucent in their color. Keep in mind that older worker and nymph termites also have similar pale coloring, so color alone cannot determine if it is a larva or not.If they have pale, white bodies but darker heads, they may be soldier termites. These are adult termites.
If they have a darker color, such as brown or black, they may be booklice or ants instead. If they have wings, they may be reproductive termites.
 Most termite larvae are less than 1/10 of an inch (2.5 mm) long. In comparison, an adult worker termite is usually around ¼ inch (6.4 mm) long. Some reproductive termites, known as alates, can grow to be half an inch (13 mm) large, but if the insect is larger than this, they may not be a termite at all.Termite larvae are about the same size as the eggs they emerge from. These eggs are very small and white. They may be difficult to find, as they are kept deep within the colony. That said, if you find some termites near a pile of eggs, you can compare the size. If they’re roughly the same size, you’ve found larvae.

 If you develop an infection, your doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics to treat the infection completely. It is important to clean and dress the blister well in order to lessen the chances of suffering an infection.


If you begin to feel generally unwell with a fever or high temperature this could be an indicator of an infection., Signs of an infection include redness and swelling around the site, or soreness that develops long after the blister occurs. Keep a close eye on the blister for these symptoms and take appropriate measures., If you can see red streaks moving away from your blister this could be an indicator of a serious infection that has spread to the lymph system. Lymphangitis often occurs when the viruses and bacteria of an infected wound extend into the channels of the lymphatic system.Other symptoms of lymphangitis include swollen lymph nodes (glands), chills, fever, loss of appetite, and a general malaise.If you are experiencing these symptoms contact a doctor immediately.
 Pus discharge is another indicator of a potentially infected blood blister. Look out for yellow and green coloured pus or cloudy fluid gathering in the blister or draining out from it. Use your judgement when dealing with your blister and use good hygiene to prevent infection.

 You will need to have an Ethernet cable to connect your Xbox One to your Internet source. Consider the length of your cable and the distance of your console from your Internet source: you don't want to get one that is too short!


Your Xbox may come with a cable included, but otherwise you will need to purchase one. Currently, Xbox Ones do not ship with a cable.;
, At the back of the Xbox One, at the lower right corner beside the infrared output, you will find your console’s LAN port. This is where you’re going to connect your Ethernet cable.
 The other end of the Ethernet cable goes directly to your internet source. Remember, your Internet source could be your router or your modem itself.


It may also be an Ethernet wall jack.
 After setting up your wired connection, you can now turn on your Xbox One. The initial boot should already give you access to the Internet.


You can turn on your console by pressing the Home button on your Xbox One controller. Xbox One added a voice recognition feature that wakes your console by just saying “Xbox On”. The Xbox One Kinect can also identify you through biometric scanning by which it automatically logs in a user via face recognition.

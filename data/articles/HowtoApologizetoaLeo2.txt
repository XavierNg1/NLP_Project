 A Leo will react positively if you express loyalty and adoration. Along with your apology, lavish them with attention and pamper them.


Leos don’t like to be unhappy, and they are quick to forgive when the apology is done right.
Offering a small, thoughtful gift along with your apology might also be effective.
 Leos love the attention and they never tire of hearing good things about themselves. It might feel a little over-the-top or strange to couple an apology with compliments, but give it a try.


Example: “I really look up to you because of how hard-working you are. I’m really sorry that I didn’t finish my part of the project, and I understand why it would upset you.”
Example: “I know how much you value friendship – it’s one of my favorite things about you. Anyone would be upset if their best friend forgot their birthday, but I know it’s especially hurtful to you and I’m very sorry.”

, If you’ve upset a Leo, be prepared to give them your complete attention. Allow them the chance to fully explain their thoughts and feelings about the matter. Don’t interrupt them. If they clam up at first, encourage them to open up. It won’t take much.


Example: “I’m know I’ve upset you and I’m very sorry. Can you tell me how you’re feeling about this situation?”
Example: “Please tell me exactly what you’re thinking and feeling – I know that I’ve offended you, and I want to make sure I never repeat this same mistake.”

, It's best to take them aside for an earnest and private conversation. Explain that you are sincerely sorry, and that you'll be more careful with their feelings. Look them directly in the eye during the apology. Speak in a serious tone. Leave behind your cell phone and other distractions, since Leos will always want your full attention.


Show them respect, love and kindness – you’ll find that a Leo will get over a situation pretty quickly when you do.
Leos are loyal to their friends. In general, they are very forgiving and don’t usually hold a grudge.

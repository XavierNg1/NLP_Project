 Even if an off-site holiday party is scheduled, an in-house potluck may allow more people to attend.;
,


Depending on when your offices are open, a lunchtime potluck meal may be the best time. More employees are typically in the office during the day.
Ask your manager if the company can cover the cost of the meat items, allowing employees to bring the fixings. If not, ask everyone to contribute a dollar or two in addition to their potluck contribution. Order the meats in advance from a restaurant, grocer, deli, etc.
Because of the cost involved and concerns about proper cooking, you may want to consider ordering hams or turkeys from a local restaurant, grocer or deli. You can pick them up before the meal and serve while it is still warm. The meats usually take the longest time and having them prepared by a professional is usually easiest. Consider ordering pre-cut turkey breasts and ham to offer a variety with easy serving.
Tofurky or other meat substitutes should also be available for any vegetarians or those with food "issues" who attend. Don't assume they'll be fine with the side dishes either. Vegetarian dishes are quick to prepare and are good menu items for vegetarian co-workers to sign up to bring. Add a "meat substitute" line to your sign up sheet if vegetarians are numerous in your workplace.
 Consider the demands of your industry. Retail businesses may need to schedule this when the location is less busy. Other offices may have many people taking their vacation the week of Christmas. Consider a time earlier in the month of December if your office tends to operate on a skeleton crew the week of Christmas.
 Reminder emails should be sent out weekly leading up to the date.


Send the initial email out as far in advance as possible. Two weeks in advance is adequate for smaller offices.
A message from the most senior manager is usually best and will probably result in a better turn out.
Managers can coordinate a system with their staffers to allow everyone a chance to get food and eat.
 Also instruct people to a specific location to sign up to bring certain dishes. Place the sign up sheet in a central location where people will see it every day.
, You don't want the sign up mixed up or accidentally thrown away.
 Volunteers will be needed to set up the food, put ice in coolers, etc. For a larger workplace, you may want to have a sign up sheet for "Set Up Volunteers" and "Clean Up Volunteers".


Consider the size of your office when adding the numbered lines. If you only have 20 people in your office, you may want to only put a few lines under each food category.
By limiting the number of items under each category you can be sure you will have enough of the appropriate food items and not 5,000 paper plates and bags of ice but nothing to eat.
 This will encourage people to sign up the weeks before and not for something at 6pm the night before. One or two business days before is usually sufficient.
 Other items may be considered depending on what may be popular locally. Adjust for the size of your office. Have them write their name and what they are bringing. (Example: John Doe - Candied Yams)

, People bringing desserts should bring pie servers or a sharp knife. Let them know on the sign up sheet and through emails and memos to bring the appropriate serving spoons to go with their dish. People bringing canned foods (cranberry sauce) may need to bring a manual can opener if your office kitchen or break area doesn't have one.
 Include a notation on the sign up sheet asking everyone to bring their dishes to the area/room it will be served at least 30-45 minutes prior to the mealtime. Those with non-perishables can place them in the room as they arrive in the morning. This will get all the food and serving ware into the right room where the volunteers can set it up.


Also include a notation that everyone is responsible for collecting their dirty dishes following the potluck.
 This will prevent food dishes from being tossed into waste paper baskets that may not have liners. You may need to move the garbage cans from other parts of the building or coordinate with the cleaning service to have the large cans and heavy duty liners available.


If your office and staff is working to be more "green" you should request specific environmentally friendly plates, cups and cutlery be purchased. Make sure you have a separate recycling container next to the trash.
To stay super green, ask everyone to bring their own plates, cups and utensils from home.
 Keep a roll of masking tape in the drop off area in case someone forgets.
 If a sink is not available, people may want to bring a plastic bag to safely transport the dirty dishes back home for cleaning.
 Having everyone with hot dishes trying to warm food in the microwave could be problematic and delay the start time of your meal.


Electric griddles are an excellent way to keep items warm when you use them on the lowest setting, monitor often and stir as needed.
Some potluck recipes are excellent when served in a slow cooker. They are easy to transport and you can be plugged in when you arrive at the office so the food stays warm.
Have tables set up near plugs to keep slow cookers and other electric serving items can be plugged in.



Wipe off any tables that will be used for serving food.
Set the plates, cutlery and napkins at the beginning of the food line, place the meats next followed by the side dishes. Place drinks and desserts and the end of the table or set up another table for those items.
If the dish isn't obvious, the dish bringer should label the dish with the name of the food and note if there are nuts, or meats in it. Just "Veggie casserole - has nuts" or "pasta salad - has become" will do. The mention of nuts is especially important if someone in your office has a nut allergy. The mention of meat is nice for vegetarians, especially when a meat or broth may be mixed in and not obvious at first glance. Label the dish or tape the note to it. Taping the note to the table may not work since dishes may get moved around as people are serving themselves.
 This is usually best as people are gathering but before everyone has served themselves and is moving to find a seat. If you have someone who can say a few words giving thanks, coordinate with them before. They can be ready to make those remarks as the manager finishes.
 These may be co-workers who have duties that are being temporarily covered by someone else.
, Encourage people to get seconds or save leftovers on plates for any shift workers that may not be awake to attend. Label these and put in the refrigerator. They'll love the thought.
 Hopefully, most people will come to collect those items and the volunteers won't be delivering bowls and platters to offices.
 Put any tables or chairs back in place. Make an announcement asking for any volunteers to help with clean up. With several people it can be done in a matter of minutes.

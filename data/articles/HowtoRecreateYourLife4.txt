 Practice articulating your dreams in a clear and positive way.
 Go back to the lists that you made and start taking action steps toward the life that you want.
 You will run into obstacles along the way that will make you doubt yourself. However, you can't afford to go back to a life in which you silenced your dreams and tried to live according to someone else's values.

 When you are looking for a new job, your new employer may ask for verification for your previous employment.


Start with information you have on hand.

Use recent pay documents such as pay stubs or tax forms to verify your job title and salary history.


Contact the Social Security Administration.

Request your earnings history on the Social Security Administration website at https://www.ssa.gov/.

You will be charged a fee depending on the number of years for which you're requesting information.
 Sites such as LinkedIn may have contact information on the company, as well as your former managers and coworkers.
Attend networking meetings in your former industry. You may meet former colleagues or friends of theirs who can help you contact them.
Contact your university's alumni association for colleagues who graduated from your school.

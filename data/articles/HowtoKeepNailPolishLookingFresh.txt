 This will polish your nails, make the nail polish last longer, and prevent the nail polish from chipping.;
, If you want to make it look really fresh, use a top coat, wait for it to dry, then apply the glitter. Let that dry, then re-apply the top coat.
 Nail polish will usually last for 5-10 weeks (depending how often you use them), so don't use old nail polish.
 Putting your nail polish upright will really help. If you really want a fresh manicure, store some bottle of nail polish in the fridge to make it nice and smooth the next time you use it.
 You can do this using a manicure kit found at any local drugstore.

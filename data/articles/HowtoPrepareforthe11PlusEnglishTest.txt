 Question types found on the 11 plus English test include comprehension exercises, essay or story writing, sentence construction, odd one out style puzzles and antonym/synonym exercises similar to those found in the 11 plus Verbal Reasoning exam.;
, Elements such as the comprehension are usually deemed the hardest to answer by children, owing to the combination of skills required for a successful answer. A comprehension exercise will typically include questions involving logic and deduction skills, definition and interpretation capability, as well as a thorough knowledge of literary terms sometimes considered beyond the expectations of Key Stage 2.
 A crucial element in the 11 plus English exam is time management, as longer tasks such as reading the comprehension passage, or writing an essay will require an organized, systematic approach for successful completion.
 Although it is possible to research what will be on the exam your child is taking, as some schools use papers prepared by external providers, it is important to ensure that your child has extensive practice and testing within all the areas which comprise 11 plus English.
 This can be achieved by starting your 11+ training in good time, widely regarded as the end of Year 4 or the beginning of Year 5, and making use of a comprehensive range of exam preparation activities and materials. Written by senior 11 plus tutors, these activities are detailed and can be found under the online courses section and include interactive and traditional lessons to unlock the full potential of your child.

, Remove the reservoir from the unit. Separate the reservoir valve, if applicable, and set it aside. Put the reservoir with the open side facing down into the top dishwasher rack. Run the dishwasher. Allow the reservoir to air dry.If you’re unsure how to remove the reservoir, navigate to https://www.waterpik.com/oral-health/product-support/manuals/ and locate your product manual.
Countertop models have a black reservoir valve. Don’t wash the valve in the dishwasher. Remove it by pressing on the bottom of the valve.
Perform such deep cleaning of the reservoir and valve every one to three months.
 Hold the valve under warm running water. Massage it continuously for 30 to 45 seconds. Set it aside to air dry. Reattach it to the reservoir dome side up, by pressing it into place with all four prongs visible underneath the reservoir.Both the valve and the reservoir should be completely clean and dry before reattaching the valve.

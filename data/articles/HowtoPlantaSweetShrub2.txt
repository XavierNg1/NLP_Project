 Sweet Shrub can easily be grown from seeds. Simply sow the seeds in springtime (March or April), preferably in a shady area of the garden in rich, well-drained, loamy soil.

Some gardeners are unlucky enough to chance upon an unscented variety when growing from seed. To prevent this, you can try planting more seeds than you need plants and removing any that emerge unscented when the plants eventually flower.






It will take two or three years for a plant grown from seed to flower. Flowers first appear in mid-March and continue into May.
 Your Sweet Shrub will flower faster if you grow it from plant cuttings instead of from seeds. Take the cuttings from a scented bush and plant them in July.

Plant the cuttings in the same conditions as you would the seeds and water until well-established.






Growing Sweet Shrub from cuttings will eliminate the chance of you growing an unscented variety of the shrub.
 If you are buying a nursery plant, try to buy it while it is blooming to get an idea of the fragrance. Plant in loamy soil, in shade conditions.

Alternately you can buy a named cultivar that is known for having a good fragrance. 'Michael Lindsey' is known for having a pleasant fragrance as well as attractive shiny leaves.






Avoid taking plants from the wild as these are endangered in some areas.

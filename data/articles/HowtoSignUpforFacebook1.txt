 Use your favorite web browser and head to an e-mail provider (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) and create an e-mail address from there.


Take note of your new e-mail address as you'll be needing it to sign-up for Facebook.
If you already have an e-mail address you want to use, proceed to step 2.;
, On the URL bar, or address bar, of your web browser, type Facebook.com and hit enter. This should take you to the Facebook main page.
 On the homepage, you will see several fields under the label “Create an account.” Enter your first name, your last name, a valid e-mail address, your preferred password, your birthday, and then select whether you are male or female. Click “Create an account” when done.


Sometimes Facebook might show you a different page than what has been described. You might only just see a Sign Up button beside the Facebook name. Click on that. Enter the necessary details for the sign up, including your new e-mail address.
Remember the e-mail address you used; this e-mail address is where Facebook will e-mail notifications that your new profile receives, so make sure you never forget the password for the e-mail.
 Facebook should send you a confirmation e-mail after signing up, so head the e-mail address you used to sign up and click the confirmation e-mail. Click the link they provided for the confirmation.


Clicking the link should then take you to your new Facebook profile.

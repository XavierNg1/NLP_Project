 Knowing who is participating allows you to accurately plan and organize how a debate should run. You should be certain to not have too many participants, as this may lead to increased confusion and loudness.;
, Nothing is worse than having several people not know what they are talking about. In order for a debate to run smoothly, tell your participants to please write some key points they would like to discuss.
 It is most common to have a spokesperson for each side of the debate, and to only allow them to speak on behalf of their respective side of the debate. To ensure that not only one person leads each side of the debate, allow for people on each side to switch out every five to ten minutes.
 The worst thing to do for a debate is for the debate to completely veer off track. This defeats the purpose of the debate, and as an organizer you should strive for the best results a debate can have.
 A debate should reach an end when both sides reach a conclusion or present all of their opinions and facts. A solution will not always be found, but a compromise or general understanding should mark the end of a debate.
 If the debate is still split, consider reorganizing at a later date and finishing on a more defined ground.
 Do not allow participants (or if applicable audiences) to interrupt your debate. Consider asking such persons to calm down, and if necessary, to leave. If things escalate to violence, consider contacting authorities.

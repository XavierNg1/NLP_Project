 Never give your dog table food. This makes dogs become table maniacs and is not healthy for your pooch. Ask your vet about food for your dog, such as what kind of food and how much food to feed your dog. Also, the fancy, expensive, wet dog food is not as healthy as they tell you . Instead, feed them Iams or other dry, healthier foods. Only feed them twice a day.Â ;
, Just like humans, dogs need plenty of play time. For humans, 60 minutes a day is ideal so why not spend it running or playing outside with you pup? That way you both are becoming healthier and more fit!

, Whether you let your dog roam the house or play in the back yard, it is better than keeping him in that kennel.
 Although it is great to exercise your dog, too much play and not enough breaks can be bad.
 Hydration is needed for a happy, healthy companion.
 Have your vet give them a ear-to-tail inspection so you can work best with your dog.

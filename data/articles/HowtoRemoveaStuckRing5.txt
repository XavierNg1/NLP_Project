 If necessary use a needle to get the dental floss under the ring.
 Wind snuggly, but not so tightly that you cause pain or turn the finger blue. Unwind it if it's too tight.
 As you unwind the dental floss from the bottom, your ring will move up your finger until you can get it off.









If the ring only goes partially off: Repeat the two previous steps from the rings current position.

 To get him in this position, you may start with your opponent on his back, and tickle his armpits until he turns over.
 Keep tickling his sides so he doesn't resist.
 You don't have to get them exactly in the armpits -- just move your feet in the general area. If you have bare feet, make sure your toenails are trimmed unless you want to scratch your opponent.
 Move your feet along the ribs as well. You can start tickling the lower back with your hands for maximum effect. Remember that you want to make use of all four of your limbs, so the sooner you start, the better.


You can really dig in with the sides of your big toes and heels.
 Try tickling his legs as well. If your opponent's shoes are still on, try taking them off to maximize your tickle skills.
 Watch out for your opponent's free arms. You need to start your tickle attack pronto so he is too weakened to fight back.

 For best results, make sure the actual card is twice the height of the envelope and the pop up shape one half the height of it. A pop up that's too big will prove cumbersome and hard to manage.


Scrapbook paper makes for good greeting card material. Cardstock works well, too -- just make sure your crease is straight and firm.;
, Give it a firm crease with your fingernail or a ruler's edge. Make sure it's straight!








, Make these about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. The cut should be made in from the folded edge of the card in order to make a flap. You can make your cuts deeper or more widely spaced if you wish; take into account the size of your pop up. A bigger pop up needs a bigger flap.









If you don't like the fact that there's now a gaping hole in your card, cover it up! Take a piece of paper, cut it to size, fold it in half, and voila! You now have a border for the edge of your card. Problem solved.
 Fold the flap over on to the front, then fold it on to the back of the card. Open the card and push the flap up toward you. Pinch the middle to crease it.
 It could be a picture of a gift, a name, a heart, a part of a photograph, or anything that takes your fancy. Cut out your pop-up shape and glue it on to the front of the pop-up - i.e., the part that is vertical when the bottom, inside portion of your card is flat against the table and the card is open. Allow the glue plenty of time to dry.









For this part, it's best to use a glue stick. You don't want a soggy mess being made of you and the card.
 Write your message, put it inside the envelope and give it to your intended recipient. They'll love it!


If you have ribbon, glitter, stickers, stamps, or any scrapbooking materials around the house, use them!

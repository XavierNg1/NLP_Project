 If the picky eater is just not able to break the human food habit you can add a small amount of meat broth (can be warmed) or a tablespoon of pureed banana or pumpkin to the dry food. You can also add cottage cheese or a little bit of a hard-boiled egg. Just remember that human food should not be more than 10% of the total daily food fed to your dog., While you are making the switch to dry food, stop feeding your dog treats all together. You should also only feed your dog twice a day until your dog is regularly eating dry dog food. After the dog is regularly eating dry food you can begin giving treats again, but never use human food as treats or the dog may relapse.


It is especially important to be consistent with your dog. Make sure that everyone in your household is aware of the rules and does not break them., Having a regular schedule for your dog’s mealtimes and taking the food away when meal time is over will encourage your dog to eat when the food is offered. It is a good idea to put food out at the same times each day and to leave the food out for your dog for 15 minutes. After this time, pick the food up and discard any leftovers. Then, feed your dog again in 12 hours and follow the same protocol. Do not give your dog anything to eat between mealtimes.If after 2 days your dog still refuses to eat give him a little of the food he is used to eating (about ½ the normal amount). Then, try again. You may also want to doctor up the dry food with a small amount of human food (no more than 10%) to increase the chances that your dog will eat., You can also try hand feeding your dog. Sit with your dog and place a few pieces of kibble in your hand. Then, offer it to your dog to see if he will eat it. If your dog is used to you handing him human food, then he may accept the kibble from your hand as well.

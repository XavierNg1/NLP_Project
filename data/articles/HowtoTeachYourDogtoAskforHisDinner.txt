 This should be done in sight of the dog so that they know that they are expecting dinner time.;
, Some dogs will automatically bark at this point, but quieter ones will not. If the dog does not bark readily you will need to do something that usually makes him bark.
 This could be something fairly simple, like knocking on the kitchen door. If possible, have another person do this while you continue to hold out the food bowl. When the dog hears the sound, he will bark, at which point say, "Ask!" - and reward the dog by giving him his dinner and perhaps stroking him.
 Eventually you will be able to just say "Ask!" and he will bark. (Remember: some dogs take longer than others to learn skills such as these, so always be patient and never lose your temper with the dog. Younger dogs are more likely to be able to learn tricks such as these than older dogs, but if you do it properly, an older dog may also learn.)

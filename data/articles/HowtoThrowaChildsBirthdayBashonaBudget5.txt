 This can be a great party if you have a pool at home. If you don't have a pool, with keeping the costs down kept in mind, try to avoid renting a local pool. Instead, have other water fun. Activities can include water balloons, a sprinkler (what kid doesn't love running through the sprinkler?), water soaked sponges to toss, a slip and slide, etc.
 Invitations can be written with a sharpie on a balloon. Blow the balloon up and just hold it closed long enough to write the invite on it and then let the air out. When the guest receives it, they will have to blow the balloon up to see what it says. Fun!


Be sure to get the permission of all parents for children to use the swimming pool. Find out who cannot swim and request that parents supervise their own child.
 Have a birthday cake, sandwiches, crisps, cupcakes, vegetables and dip and other tasty foods. Keep the food simple and in small amounts, and ensure that food is eaten after the swimming has been finished, to avoid tummy aches.


The cake could be decorated to look like a swimming pool if wished.

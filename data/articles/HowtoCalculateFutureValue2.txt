 Simple interest is the easiest type of interest to calculate. It is the product of the principal times the interest rate times time. The formula for the future value of money using simple interest is FV = P(1 + rt).In this formula, FV = the future value, P = the principal amount, r = rate of interest per year (expressed as a decimal) and t = the number of years.
 Suppose you know that you need $20,000 in 18 years to pay for college for your daughter. If an investment pays 8 percent simple interest per year, determine how much money you need to deposit now to have $20,000 in 18 years.


In this example, you know the future value, and you need to solve for P, which is the principal amount. Therefore, FV = $20,000; r = .08 (8 percent interest expressed as a decimal); and t = 18.
20,000 = P(1 + .08*18)
20,000 = P x 2.44
20,000 / 2.44 = P
P = $8,196.72
Therefore, you would need to deposit $8,196.72 in the account today in order to have $20,000 in 18 years.
 Suppose you know that you need $20,000 in 18 years to pay for college for your daughter. If an investment pays 8 percent simple interest per year, determine how much money you need to deposit now to have $20,000 in 18 years. In this example, you know the future value, $20,000, and you need to solve for P, the principal. The number of compounding periods is 1 since interest is compounded annually.


20,000 = P(1 + .08/1)^(1*18)
20,000 = P(1.08)Ë†18
20,000 = P x 3.996
20,000 / 3.996 = P
5,005 = P
In this example, you would need to deposit $5,005 today in order to have $20,000 in 18 years.

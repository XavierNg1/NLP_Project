 If the contractor’s fault or neglect causes the delay, this clause would allow you to require the contractor to work more hours to complete the project on time.If an owner forces a contractor to complete a project despite excusable delays for which the contractor was entitled to a time extension, the contractor may be able to sue the owner for damages if the acceleration caused additional cost. For example, the contractor may have needed to hire two more laborers to help complete the last phase of the project in a shorter time period., Because it’s difficult to predict when drafting a contract what damages might be caused by delays during the project, many construction contracts include a clause providing for liquidated or pre-set damages for delays.Damages for delay, in particular, are difficult to prove, and for this reason a liquidated damages clause is often favored.Some contractors believe they are not liable for damages for delay unless there is a liquidated damages clause. However, they still may be liable for actual damages caused by a delay that was reasonably foreseeable when the agreement was made.For example, if an apartment building was supposed to be completed in 500 days, but it took the contractor 600 days due to rain, the contractor would be liable to the building owner for actual damages caused by his delay. It wouldn’t be reasonable for him to believe that it wouldn’t rain for 500 days.
Liquidated damages clauses are only enforceable if actual damages would be difficult or impossible to estimate. The amount set forth in the clause must be a reasonable estimate of what actual damages might be, and can’t be intended to punish the other party for delaying.For example, a restaurateur may hire a contractor to build a new restaurant by a certain date. The restaurateur and the contractor have no idea how much business the new restaurant might have after it opens, so liquidated damages for any delay would be appropriate in this instance.An owner cannot recover both actual damages and liquidated damages from a contractor who delays his performance.Liquidated damages can be escalated to reflect the increasing costs of a delay that lasts for an extended period of time.For example, a liquidated damages clause might say: "If the Contractor fails to complete the work within the contract time, the Contractor agrees to pay the Owner $300 per day as liquidated damages to cover losses, expenses and damages, not to exceed $10,000."

, Drafting a contract involves planning for all contingencies, so consider including a clause that allows the owner to escape the contract in a worst-case scenario where the contractor is responsible for repeated and significant inexcusable delays.

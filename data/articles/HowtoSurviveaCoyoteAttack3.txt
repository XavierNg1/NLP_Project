 Do this if your initial efforts to look and sound aggressive do not force the animal to retreat. While moving away, maintain your dominant and powerful stance and keep facing the coyote.
 This increases like likelihood of being attacked. You cannot outrun a coyote. It may go against your gut instinct to not run away, but this is an important preventive measure against a coyote attack., Coyotes show their aggression by growling or snarling. If you see these behaviors, try throwing sticks or dirt, either at the ground near the coyote or at the coyote itself. Avoid aiming to strike the coyote's head, as this may intensify the animal's aggression.
 Try again to back away from the animal. De-escalation is the best strategy as an attack looks increasingly possible.
 These areas of the body are vulnerable to serious injury and blood loss through biting.
 Do not use poisons against coyotes as these are inhumane and may also be illegal. Further, they may result in the secondary poisoning of other pets or animals.In addition, do not try to enclose or capture the animal. It is most important that you get yourself (and your group if this is the case) to safety. Further, it is illegal to keep wild animals and domesticate them.
 You should especially see a medical professional if you have been bitten so the wound can be assessed and cleaned. In most attacks to date, the coyote was either being fed by people or had bitten an individual while he or she tried to rescue a pet from the coyote. In rare cases, individuals were bitten by cornered coyotes; even more rare are attacks by rabid coyotes.

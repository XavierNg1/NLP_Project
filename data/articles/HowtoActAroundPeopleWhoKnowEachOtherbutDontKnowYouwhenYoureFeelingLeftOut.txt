 Sociologically speaking, groups of friends can easily spot the person who is the odd one out. How you look, smell (yes smell), and act, can and will determine whether they decide to embrace you, or keep you left out. Make sure you don't look all snobby and messy; this will make it harder for people to engage with you.;
, If you've never seen them before, explain that you're new, or that you came with so-and-so, or whatever your situation is. Don't say "Help! I don't know anyone" unless you're fairly certain that they don't either.
 Introduce yourself to a few people and ask vague questions, like "how long have you been working here?", "how do you know ______?" or, "what's your major?". Keep conversations fairly brief until you've introduced yourself to several people. Try to find people who you can relate to--if you're at a college party and a girl, try to find other girls who look like they need a friend. If you're a guy, this is somewhat harder, but helps if you have a friend at the party/event.
 It is important that this is not forced--don't say anything unless you feel like it will be pertinent to their story. Make sure that when you speak, it is loud and clear so that the group focuses on you while you're speaking.
 If they are boring you, then excuse yourself to get a snack, use the restroom, or answer a text. Then move on to someone else.
 Recount personal experiences (not too personal though!)that relate to the topic, or express opinions when asked. Most of all, ask questions! Try to find what the person is interested in, and if possible, engage in a stimulating conversation.

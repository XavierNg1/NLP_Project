 If you have no credit history, the first step towards getting a car loan is opening a bank account. A bank account will be your first step into the world of credit, and will be the base of your loan. You do not need any prior credit to open a basic checking or savings account.
 A large down payment on a car will make the loan easier to get, and will result in having to pay less for the car in the long run. If you can, try to save up between 10-20% of the total cost of the car.The more you can save for the down payment, the less you’ll have to pay later on.
 You will need a copy of your new bank statement, proof of employment history, and any paid bills such as your phone or utilities. These will show the lender that you are able to make payments on a loan.
 A cosigner will help shoulder the responsibility of your payments. Be very aware of the risk that your cosigner is in. If you don’t make your payments, it falls on the cosigner to do so, otherwise their credit gets damaged. Make sure that you have a good relationship with your cosigner, and treat the loan with respect.
 Your financial institution is more likely to give you a favorable loan than any other place. Banks like to do business with their own customers, so you will be treated more favorably than a stranger.


Check with other reputable banks and lending institutions before moving on to car dealerships. Finding a loan with no credit is usually easier than finding one with bad credit.
 If your bank is unable to get a loan for you, ask the dealership where you plan to purchase your car what kind of loan options they offer. A dealer is very likely to try to get a loan for you so that they can make a profit. Be aware that a dealership loan will usually be more expensive than a bank loan.
 Once you have your loan, always make your monthly payments on time. This will be your first major entry in your credit history, and starting strong will lead to much better credit in the future.

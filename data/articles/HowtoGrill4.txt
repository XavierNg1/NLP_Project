 Use a wire brush to scrub off the bars.
 If your cloth was wet, not oiled, be sure to use some cooking spray on the grates afterward.
 Keeping your grill and grill area clean, dry, and uncluttered is not just aesthetically pleasing, but safer and cost effective. Grills will deteriorate quickly if left wet and out in the rain, especially charcoal ones (because wet wood ash is caustic and will rust through the grill very quickly).
 Wheel your grill inside as soon as it is cool, or purchase a grill cover.

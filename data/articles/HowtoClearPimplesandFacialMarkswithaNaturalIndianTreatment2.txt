, Studies have suggested that trying a poly-herbal topical ointment, Shalmalyadilepa, and an oral treatment, Guduchyadivati, may be effective in reducing acne. Consult with an Ayurvedic medical practitioner.Shalmalyadilepa contains Shalmali thorn (Salmalia malabarica), Vata buds (Ficus bengalensis), Jaatiphala fruits (Myristica fragrans), Lodhra bark (Symplocos racemosa), Massora seed (Lens culinaris), and Raktachandana (Pterocarpus santalinus).

Guduchyadivati contains equal parts Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia), Manjistha (Rubia cordifolia), and Krishnasariva (Hemidesmus indicus)., Tea Tree, Melaleuca alternifolia, is a native Australian tree that has been widely used in Aboriginal medicine. Studies also show that it is highly effective at combating acne when applied in a 5% solution once a day for three months.Tea Tree oil takes a little longer to work than other acne treatments, such as benzoyl peroxide, but it also has fewer unpleasant side effects (e.g., itching, dryness, or irritation).
If you want the treatment to work a little faster, apply the oil to your skin twice a day, for 20 minutes per treatment. Wash your skin afterward with a gentle cleanser. Do this treatment regimen for 45 days.Do not consume tea tree oil. It is toxic when ingested.

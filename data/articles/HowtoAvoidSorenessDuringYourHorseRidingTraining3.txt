 To start, stand up with your feet placed under your hips. Curl your fingers into loose fists with your thumbs sticking out. Keep your upper arms and elbows tucked to your sides. Raise your forearms to either side of you, with your palms facing up and your thumbs pointing behind you. Then:Bend your knees a little bit while tucking your tailbone inward.
Keeping your feet in place, turn your upper torso to one side, twisting from your waist.
Stop once your rear arm is pointed directly behind your butt.
Twist back to your original position, again using the muscles in your waist.
Perform the same movements on your other side for one rep.
 To begin, stand with your feet placed a hand’s length apart.Keeping your upper arms and elbow tucked to your sides, raise your forearms straight out to either side with your palms facing in front of you. Spread your fingers wide to keep the muscles in your hands, arms, and back active (think “jazz hands”). Next:Raise one foot slightly off the ground.
Keep your other leg’s knee slightly bent to better absorb your body weight.
Rotate your raised foot until your toes point inward.
Focus on your heel as it directs each movement, not your toes.
Lower your foot and repeat the exercise with your other foot.
Concentrate on your heels throughout to keep your core muscles engaged.
 Set your feet a hand’s length apart.Bend your knees as you do so your entire back makes contact with the wall. Tuck your upper arms and elbows into your side. Raise your forearms straight out to either side. Now:Sweep your forearms in toward each to clap your hands in front of you.
As you do, keep your forearms perpendicular to your body.
Once your hands have clapped, fold your fingers with your thumbs on top to mimic holding a rein.
Bring your forearms back to starting position and repeat.

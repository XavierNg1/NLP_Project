 New legislation is never written in plain English. It is always full of legal jargon and long-winded explanations. So, how can we make sense of it all?


Hire an external Human Resources consultant (often more cost effective than a solicitor) to translate the legislation for you. This is by far the easiest and quickest way of ensuring your organisation is ready to adhere to new legislation. They will also be able to write and implement a policy that will suit the individual needs of your organisation. This also gives peace of mind because all consultants should have insurance to give businesses advice.
Search the internet for as much information as you can find on the new legislation. Other companies may have published information in a straightforward format that is easy to understand. This can be very time consuming and you might find contradictory information. It can be very difficult to know what is right and relevant to your business.;
, New national legislation guidelines will always be printed in the media as well as reported on the news. This will give a correct overview of the legislation, however, it will only be published as the deadline date draws near, which may not give you enough time to prepare and implement a policy.
 People often take different views from the same thing. It may be that a similar business has picked up on a specific detail of the legislation that you missed, or vice versa. This form of benchmarking is very useful and helps to reinforce good relationships with like-minded businesses.
 A policy written for one business will not necessarily be suitable for all businesses. Your organisationâ€™s structure and culture must always be taken in to consideration when writing a policy whether for legislation or best practice.

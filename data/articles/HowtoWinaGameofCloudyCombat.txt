 It is: Never request an alliance with somebody who has much better weapons than you. Even if they accept, the chances of betrayal are extremely high. However, if they requested the alliance, it's a good idea to accept.;
, This is a good idea because you don't know what sort of weapons you'll get. They may still betray you, but given that there's a chance your items will be better or the same, the chances are a bit lower.
 As the choice is accept or die, it will most likely be the latter.
 Firstly it's not that nice, secondly others will be less likely to team with you afterwards, and thirdly the dead teammate may return as a spectator to stop you from winning.
 It may sound obvious, but hiding until everyone else is dead actually works a lot better than you think.
 If you were lucky enough to get a knockback ink sac, then use it. It's a peaceful and relatively clear of ways to backfire.
 Be quick when you do this though, otherwise they'll swim back up. If you get stuck in a water source, make sure you have plenty of wood at hand.
 It's next to impossible to pull off an aggressive victory without good stuff. Kill people with good things, some maps have diamonds on the bottoms of islands––be creative!

, Don't request alliances and don't accept them unless the player has good loot. Moreover, it's up to you if you want to betray teammates, but as mentioned, this can easily backfire.
 If there is someone in your range, then go for them.

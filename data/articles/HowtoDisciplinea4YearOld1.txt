 You can create an environment in your home that saves you and your child from the needing to work on discipline unless it is necessary. By setting your home up so that it is safe and child-friendly, you will prevent having to create too many rules or say “no” too often throughout the day.


Use child-proofing devices to keep cupboards closed.
Close doors to rooms where young children won’t be safe if they are on their own.
Use child-proof barriers or gates to block unsafe areas like stairs.;
, Young children love to play, and playing is important to their healthy development. You don’t need to have expensive toys – children can have a wonderful play time with cardboard boxes, inexpensive toys, or pots and pans. Sometimes the simplest things can spark children’s imagination, so if you cannot afford expensive toys, do not feel guilty., Children can misbehave when they are bored or hungry. Be sure that you leave home with toys your child enjoys playing with and with snacks that are healthy and appealing., Children who are four years old will probably enjoy being active participants in creating rules. Take the time to work with your child to make rules that are reasonable. This will help your child to have a clear sense of your expectations. Because they participated in creating the rules, they will be more willing to follow them and you will be helping them to learn self-control. , Children this age will be overwhelmed if there are too many rules to remember. A four-year-old might ignore rules if there are too many, or could feel frustrated – and act out that frustration – trying to follow too many rules.


Work with caregivers to help them understand the rules you and your child have agreed upon.

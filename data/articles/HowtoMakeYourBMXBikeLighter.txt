 If you really want to have a good bike, you will need to have at least $250.;
, The left brake is useless and will only slow you down. If you want to go even faster, take off both brakes, but this is not recommended, for safety reasons.
 If you have a heavy bike, this may be the reason. Maybe your sprocket is too big or your frame is too heavy. Try to invest into a new frame, maybe like a Stolen or a Fit.
 These parts are only more weight onto your bike. Yes, they can help, but would you rather go faster and have fun? This one is optional but not recommended, since it does put you at more risk.
 If you use 4pc, that's just even more weight.
 If you have good tires, you are practically set. People may think that skinny tires make you faster, but thick tires are so much better. Consider Cult Vans Tires.
 If your seat is too heavy, that could be the thing slowing you down. Get a Shadow Conspiracy seat, they for sure are the best seats out there.
 Hopefully this helped, and good bike riding!

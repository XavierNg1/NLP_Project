 If you are participating in a live action role playing game (LARP), you may have already been assigned a particular vampire to play. However, if the event is more open-ended, you may get to choose a particular character. If you are not sure which vampire you could find some inspiration by reading some vampire books or watching a vampire movie:


Read John William Polidori's The Vampyre.

Read Bram Stoker's Dracula.

Read Stephenie Meyer's Twilight.

Check out Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles.

Watch a vampire themed television show, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel or The Vampire Diaries.

Watch a vampire movie, such as Nosferatu, Interview with a Vampire, The Lost Boys, Blade, Vampires, or From Dusk Til Dawn.”


, During the LARP, you should always have a reason for making a move against another character in the game. You should always play fair and avoid cheating. That said, you should have fun playing the role of vampire, which may include cruel or “unfair” things, like blood sucking or killing another character., Vampires are typically depicted as narcissistic or self-serving.To highlight this trait, try walking with an air of authority, with your shoulders back and your head held high.You should only be interested in talking about yourself.
You should only become animated during your own speeches. If anyone else dares to open their mouth, you should adopt an expression of boredom and disdain.Whenever someone you don't approve of is speaking, you should adopt an expression of distaste and look down your nose at the speaker.
 By knowing your character, you can respond quickly to other players in the LARP. You can improvise and have fun!For instance, your character probably has an ability to heal rapidly. Vampires can be brought to the very brink of destruction, only to be resuscitated and restored to their former glory by a few drops of blood.
Try speaking in a low voice. As depicted in vampire movies, a low speaking voice is typical of vampires.

 You can use just about any cookie for your cookie butter, but a simple sugar cookie or tea biscuit will produce the perfect crumbs for your purposes.No matter what cookie you end up using, just be sure to try it first! If you’re not crazy about the cookie in its original form, you probably won’t love it as a soft spread.
 Using your hands or a heavy kitchen implement, crush the intact cookies until you have two cups (680 g) of crumbs. You can work with more or less cookies, as long as you adjust the quantity of brown sugar and whipping cream accordingly.


It’s okay if your cookie has some chunks in it—for example, some large oats, raisins, or chocolate chips—as long as you’re okay with the resultant butter having tangible chunks in it too.
 Mix two tablespoons (28 g) brown sugar with the cookie crumbs in an electric food processor until you've achieved a sufficiently fine, powdery mix for your butter. If mixing by hand, your mixture will be chunkier.If you find that your brown sugar has become rock-hard at the back of your cabinet, try tossing a piece of bread in the sugar bag and sealing it back up. In most cases, your brown sugar will break and soften right up., Once you have a fine blend of cookies and sugar, pour ¼ cup (85 g) whipping cream into the still-running mixer. Keep blending until you have a smooth, creamy spread.


Just about any brand of whipping cream should do the trick, but you might want to select a heavy cream—about 39% fat as opposed to the 30% in whipping cream—if you prefer richer confections., If you’re making cookie butter for a party or a family gathering, you might not have to worry about leftovers. If you’re planning to use the cookie butter gradually, though, you’ll want to put it in a lidded plastic or glass container and keep it cool.

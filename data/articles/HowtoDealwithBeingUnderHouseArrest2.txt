 People who are detained under house arrest will in many instances be subject to monitoring of more than your whereabouts. Depending on your conviction, you can be required to submit to alcohol and/or drug testing. If you are in any doubt about what to expect talk to your attorney and ask them specifically any drug and alcohol tests.
 If your conviction was related to alcohol consumption, or the judge deemed you to have a problem with alcohol, she may require you to wear what is known as a SCRAM device. SCRAM stands for Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitor and is a bracelet that monitors your alcohol consumption, which you might be required to wear as part of the conditions of your house arrest.


In most instances this device doesn't monitor your whereabouts, but it does continuously monitor alcohol concentration.It works by monitoring the concentration of alcohol in the perspiration on the surface of the skin.
It uses similar technology as a breathalyser, and as such can detect very small concentrations of alcohol.
 If your conviction was related to narcotics, the judge may require you to wear patches which detect if you have taken any drugs. Generally a patch will last a week before it is taken off and replaced. The patches will then be tested for traces of drugs, such as marijuana, heroin, PCP, methamphetamines and cocaine.

As with every other condition of your house arrest, if you violate the agreement you may lose your house arrest status and have to serve the remainder of your sentence in prison.

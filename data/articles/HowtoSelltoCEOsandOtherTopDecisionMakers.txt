For sales reps, just getting on a CEO's radar screen is murder. Once youâ€™re there, keeping a CEO's attention is even tougher. You need an incredibly tight, focused message. One mistake can be deadly.;

CEOs are responsible for setting company strategy, which is really about how resources will be deployed. If they make the wrong move, expensive resources will be mis-allocated at a disastrous financial and human cost to the company's shareholders and employees. If you understand the risks CEOs face in general, and if you understand the SPECIFIC risks that your prospect CEO is up against on the project you're trying to sell, you vastly improve your chances of success.


Most employees live in the present, working to make the CEO's vision a reality. CEOs, on the other hand, have to live in the future. For CEOs, it's about the big picture, the long-term. If you can get in sync with the CEO's concerns and show how your solution will be the right one a year, five years, ten years down the road, that'll go a long way toward winning over the CEO.

 You want to use the broiler in the oven. You can bake it in the oven, but it takes longer and isn't necessary for toast.


You can also make toast in a toaster oven instead of a conventional oven. Just turn the setting to your desired darkness. As long as you watch the toast, you won't burn it.
 Use a butter knife to spread butter on the bread before you place it into the oven. Make sure to use real butter instead of margarine.


An alternative is to spread the butter on the bread after the bread is finished. However, buttering the bread before you put it into the oven bakes the butter into the bread, giving it a better flavor.
You can butter both sides of the bread or just one side. This is up to you.
 Put the bread into the broiler, or onto the wire rack if you are using a toaster oven. Let it cook for 2-3 minutes. Make sure to keep watching the bread. If you like your bread lighter, don't let it cook as long; if you like darker bread, let it cook for longer. Turn the bread over when the first side is brown enough. Let the next side cook for 2-3 minutes.If you are using a toaster oven, you probably will not have to flip it over because the bread will cook on both sides.
You don't have to flip it over and cook it on both sides. You can leave one side un-toasted if you wish. It will still be warm and slightly cooked from being in the oven.
 When the bread is to your desired level of toasted, remove it and place it on a plate. If you haven't buttered the toast already, add butter now.

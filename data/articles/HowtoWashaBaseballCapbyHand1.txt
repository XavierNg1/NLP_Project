 You can use a clean bucket, but a kitchen or bathroom sink is also fine. Fill it with water. It’s best to use cool water. If the cap is really dirty, you can use slightly warm water. Definitely avoid hot water, however, since this can damage the hat., Any type of non-bleach detergent normally used for clothing should work. You don’t need much of it - about a tablespoon should be plenty. Make sure it is thoroughly mixed into the water.
 If there are any especially soiled spots on your hat, like clumps of mud or stains, you can pre-wash those. Take a clean cotton swab or an old toothbrush. Dip it in the detergent you are using, and gently spot-clean.
 Plunge your hat into the mixture of cool water and detergent so that it is thoroughly wet. Then, just walk away! Let it soak for a while, preferably for several hours. This will gently clean your hat.








You can periodically lift your hat out of the water to check and see if dirt and grime are soaking off.
 After your hat is done soaking, drain the water from your bucket or sink. Place the hat under warm (not hot) running water. Rinse away all of the suds. This should also help remove any lingering traces of grime.
 Grab a clean towel and dab at the hat. This will wick away a lot of the water. Just make sure to be gentle, and not scrub. Once the excess water is gone, just leave your hat out to air dry.








Placing your hat on top of a melon, ball, or other rounded object will help it keep its shape while it dries. You can also just wear the hat until it is dry.
Do not put your hat in a clothes dryer. This will damage it.

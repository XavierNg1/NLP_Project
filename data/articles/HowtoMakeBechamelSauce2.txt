 Place the butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Heat the butter until it is completely melted, but do not let it brown.
 Place all of the flour at once into the pan with the butter. It will clump up at first. Stir it with a wooden spoon to remove the clumps and create a smooth mixture.
 Continue cooking the roux over medium heat, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes. As you cook, the roux will begin to darken. It's ready when it reaches a golden hue; this is called "blond" roux.Don't let the roux get brown, as this will affect the flavor and color of the bechamel sauce.
If necessary, turn the heat down to low so that the roux doesn't cook too quickly.

 Before adding your bandana, you need to style your hair. Pull it back into a pony tail at your desired height and secure it with an elastic. If you wish to pull your bangs out, do so before adding your bandana., Lay you bandana flat. You can use a square or rectangular bandana for this style. If you have a square bandana, fold it in half to form a triangle. If you have a rectangular bandana, fold it hot-dog style in half. Create a skinny strip by making 1” folds starting from the bottom of your bandana.
 Flip your pony tail over the top of your head. Place the center of your skinny bandana strip on the elastic under your ponytail. Move your hands toward the ends of the bandana as you bring it up above your head. As you pull the ends up, flip your ponytail back into its natural position.
 Take one of the ends and wrap it under the other to create a knot. Double knot this if you feel it won’t be secure enough with a single knot. Let the sides hang down beside your ponytail. Loosen the folds if you wish to show off your bandana. Run your fingers through your pony tail to loosen your hair strands around the bandana for a more natural look.

 "prt sc" stands for Print Screen. All Windows operating systems will have this functionality built in already. This will copy whatever is on your screen to the clipboard. You can then paste it into a program such as Paint, Word, PowerPoint, etc.
 Depending on your keyboard, "prt sc" may be its own button. On other keyboards, though, it may share with another button. It is usually located in the upper right of the keyboard, near the number pad if you have one. This will copy to the clipboard whatever is on your screen.
 Many programs will accept pasted images, including Word, PowerPoint, Paint, PhotoShop, etc. While in the program, either press CTRL + V or right-click and select "Paste" from the dropdown menu in order to paste the screenshot.

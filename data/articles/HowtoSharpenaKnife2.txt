 The honing rod, or simply "steel" as they're often called, aren't normally used to resuscitate a dull blade from the proverbial graveyard. Instead, they're often used to keep knives sharp in between use.


Using a honing rod regularly delays the need to use a whetstone or a diamond. This is a good thing: Using whetstones and diamonds shave metal from the edge of your blade, reducing the knife's lifespan. The less you use your whetstone, the longer your knives will thrive.
What does a honing rod do? A honing rod realigns the metal in a blade, massaging small nicks, indentations, and flat spots away. Compared to a whetstone, it does not remove any significant amount of metal from the blade of the knife.
 The rod should be held at a comfortable angle facing away from your body. The rod tip should be elevated above the rod handle.
 Your four fingers should be holding onto the handle, while your thumb can be placed on the spine of the knife, far away from the blade edge.
 Your angle doesn't need to be exact, just approximate. Whatever angle you decide to choose, or unwittingly end up choosing, make sure to maintain the same angle throughout the honing process. Changing the angle used during the honing process won't smooth out the metal in the blade as much as using a consistent angle will., Try to start this motion with the heel of the knife touching the rod and end it with the tip of the knife touching the rod.









In order to master this process, you'll need to move your arm, your hand, and your wrist. What's especially important to get the right action is moving the wrist. Without moving the wrist, you won't be able to sweep the entire blade — heel to tip — across the honing rod.
 Using the same sweep of your arm, hand, and wrist, gently move the knife across the lower half of the rod. Use only as much pressure as the weight of the knife itself. After completing both a top- and bottom sweep, you've done one revolution.

 While it is possible to boil any potato you happen to have, some potatoes are better boiled than others (namely, the waxy ones), while some potatoes (namely, the floury ones) are not ideal for boiling and will often turn to mush. Knowing which potato to choose makes all the difference:









Choose waxy potatoes for boiling. Waxy potatoes have a high water content and a low starch content. This helps the potatoes to keep their shape. This is particularly useful if you're making potato salad.
Choose new potatoes (also known as chats) for boiling. New potatoes are lovely boiled, and they don't need to be cooked for too long.
Good potato choices for boiling: Bintje, Desir√©e (fair), Kennebec, Kipfler, chats (new potatoes), Nicola, Patrones, Pink Eye, (Red) Pontiac, Pink Fir Apple, Sebago (good rather than excellent), Sequoia etc.;

 Do not change who you are for a guy.;
, Don't wear clothes that make your thighs or stomach look big. If you're pleasantly plump don't fret it. Just find clothes that are tight on your breast but not on the love.
 Try more natural colors that go well with your skin. Eye shadow depends a lot on your eye color. Test out some different colors until you find the right one. Wear lip gloss that is clear. Don't go hot pink or bright red, you'll look like a drag queen.
 When you're nervous, you don't look confident. If you don't look confident, then you don't look like a possible date. Try to act calm but fun!

, You don't want to get dressed up and be all sweet to a jerk. Make sure he isn't mean and if he's mean to your friends, he's totally not worth it.
 Don't laugh at anything you say until he laughs. Don't compliment him to the point of it just becoming intolerable to be around you. Show him you like him in a coo hard to get but giving signs way.
 If he is a major football fan and you despise football, it might not work. Also, if he is interested into girls with big fronts and you don't have any, he might not be so interested.
 Men find it irresistible when a woman is sexy, classy and confident.
 Confidence is the ultimate type of sexy.
 Don't lie to impress him, don't try to make him jealous, don't lead him on if you're not into everything. Those things are wrong, if you feel the need to do that then you don't know the meaning of a true relationship. Be honest and open with him. If the two of you are mature then you will handle it correctly.
 Your man will find it sexy that you have other priorities, or want a girls day out. Don't revolve your world around him.
 Set aside some time for him, call him, text him, make him know you care for him and that you WILL be there for him. That's the root of a real relationship, so why not advertise it before hand.

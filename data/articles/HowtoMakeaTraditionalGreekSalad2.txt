 Unlike most traditional Greek salads, this recipe doesn’t include lettuce as the base. Freshly chopped vegetables dressed with a delicious vinaigrette are the stars of this recipe.Here's what you'll need:


1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup white wine vinegar
1 tsp rosemary leaves
1 tsp thyme leaves
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp oregano leaves
3 cups seeded and diced cucumbers
3 cups seeded and diced tomatoes
1/2 cup thinly sliced red onion
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese

, Seed the cucumbers and tomatoes, then dice them so that they are uniformly cut into ¾-inch pieces. Slice the red onion thinly.Some people enjoy having beets in their Greek salad. To alter the recipe a little, slice a roasted beet into half coins to add to your vegetable salad.
Olives are another way to incorporate rich Greek flavors into your vegetable salad. Add 2/3 of a cup of pitted kalamata olives or black olives if you'd like.
 In a large bowl, mix the olive oil, white wine vinegar, and herbs with a whisk until the ingredients are blended together well. Taste the vinaigrette and add salt and pepper as need.
 Add the cucumbers, onion, and tomatoes to the bowl with the vinaigrette. Use a pair of tongs to toss the ingredients well. The vegetable pieces should be evenly coated by the herb vinaigrette.To allow the flavors to meld, you can over and refrigerate the vegetable salad for at least an hour before you serve.
When you’re ready to eat the salad, sprinkle it with feta cheese.

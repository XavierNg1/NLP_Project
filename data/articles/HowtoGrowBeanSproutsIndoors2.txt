 You can find a sprouting jar with a mesh lid at most garden supply centers, or you can use any standard glass jar. Wash it thoroughly with hot water and soap. You can also use a small plastic container ,eg. the rectangular ones you find in the DIY shop.
 Place them in a colander and run cold water over them.
 It is best to use a small amount, since a larger number of beans may make it easier for mold or other types of bacteria and fungi to grow.
 Fill the jar to the top and cap it with a mesh lid.
 Secure it in place with an elastic band. Cloth blocks out most of the air flow but permits just enough to prevent mold. Do not use a solid metal cap.
 Allow the beans to soak 8 to 10 hours.
 Open the container, pour cool to lukewarm water over the beans, and swish them around. Reseal the container and drain off the water again.
 A dark cupboard works best. Rinse and drain the beans with water twice a day. Rinsing the beans keeps them clean and moist.
 Growth usually starts within two to three days, and sprouts are usually ready to harvest after four or five days.
 Rinse, drain, and spread the sprouts out on a clean paper towel for eight hours, or until excess water evaporates.

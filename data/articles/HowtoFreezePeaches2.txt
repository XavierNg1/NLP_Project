 Use your fingers to carefully peel away the skin from the peach. It should come loose without trouble after the blanching and cooling steps. It's easiest to start peeling from the "X" mark across the top of the peach. Peel the skin away in strips and discard them.
 Using a very sharp knife, hold a peach in your hand and slice it in half, cutting around the pit. Cut all the way around the peach, then lift half of the peach away from the pit. Remove the pit from the other half of the peach and discard it. Repeat with the remaining peaches.









You might have to gently twist the peach halves to extract them from the pit.
Do your best to keep the peach halves intact as you separate them from the pit.
 Use your knife to slice the peaches into equal-sized wedges. Make them as small or as large as you'd like, depending on what you plan to use the peach slices for.

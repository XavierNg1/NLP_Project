 If none of the natural or professional products work on your pimple, you may need to use makeup to hide it. You can use makeup concealer over the pimple so it is less noticeable.Apply foundation and/or tinted moisturizer to your face. Then, apply a skincare serum or face moisturizer to the pimple. This will give the area around the pimple more moisture and calm down the red skin.
Take your concealer and draw a small X over the pimple. You may use the wand if your concealer comes with a wand or use a small makeup brush to apply the concealer. Draw a circle around the X. Using a clean fingertip, lightly tap the concealer into your skin. Dab, rather than rub, the concealer around and over the pimple.
You should then apply foundation with a brush to set the concealer. This will ensure the concealer stays over the pimple.
 You can also wear accessories like a bold necklace or earrings to distract from the pimple on your face. You may try to have your accessories go with your outfit and show off another part of your body, like your ears or your neck, to distract from the pimple.
 You can also improve the appearance of your skin overall by getting a good nightâ€™s sleep. Getting at least eight hours of sleep will help your skin to appear less puffy and irritated in the morning.


Make sure you wash and moisturize your face before you go to bed to ensure your skin is not irritated further during the night. You may also want to apply a spot treatment product that contains salicylic acid to the pimple and leave it on overnight.

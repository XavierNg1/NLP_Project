 If it's rectangle, just measure the longest side and the shortest side of the pool. If it's a square, just measure one of the sides of the pool -- all four sides of the square will have the same length. And if your pool is round, just measure the diameter of the pool, which is the longest path that can travel through the center of the circle, from one edge to the other.;
, This is the other dimension that is crucial to knowing the volume of your pool. If your pool has the same depth throughout -- most above ground pools are structured this way, for example -- then you'll just have to take one measurement from the top to the bottom of the pool. But if, like most pools, your pool has depth that gradually increases, then you'll have to measure the minimum depth (the shallow end) and the maximum depth (the deep end) of the pool.

 In molecular orbital theory, bond order is defined as half of the difference between the number of bonding and antibonding electrons. Bond order = /2.
 Each electron that entered a bonding molecular orbital will help stabilize the new molecule. Each electron that entered an antibonding molecular orbital will act to destabilize the new molecule. Note the new energy state as the bond order of the molecule.

If the bond order is zero, the molecule cannot form. The higher bond orders indicate greater stability for the new molecule.
 Hydrogen atoms have one electron in the s shell, and the s shell is capable of holding two electrons. When two hydrogen atoms bond together, each completes the s shell of the other. Two bonding orbitals are formed. No electrons are forced to move to the next higher orbital, the p shell – so no antibonding orbitals are formed. The bonding order is thus (2−0)/2{\displaystyle (2-0)/2}, which equals 1. This forms the common molecule H2: hydrogen gas.

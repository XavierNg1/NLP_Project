 The Internet and the various social media outlets are very strong tools in building public opinion. If you know someone who is good at web design, you may even create a site of your own to post information, share research, and gather public opinion in support of your cause. You can also make strong use of Twitter or other outlets to reach a wide section of the population.


For example, the latest efforts in the ongoing civil rights movement have become universal through Twitter and Facebook with "#blacklivesmatter." The creation of a catchy phrase and a hashtag gets instant attention when the topic goes viral.Another topic that caught wide attention through social media was the Occupy Wall Street movement. Organizers gained wide recognition with the creation of @OccupyWallSt on Twitter. That single name alone received over 200,000 followers., While computerized social media is quick and efficient, there is still a large proportion of the population that reads newspapers and gathers opinions from regional or national printed sources.
 The idea of a group of people coming together on a topic as emotional as the death penalty is usually enough to catch the attention of the local news. You should contact regional television news stations and notify them of any events you are holding, notify them of your petition drive before it begins (this will encourage some people to look for you to sign the petition), and notify them of opportunities to join your campaign.

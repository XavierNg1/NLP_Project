 Before you can begin crocheting your hat, you need to determine how large or small to make it. There are two options: you can use general guidelines to choose your size, or take a head measurement for a more specific fit. Either will work well enough, but you probably won’t be able to get an exact measurement for a hat that’s being gifted. The circumference (forehead to back of the head) and the height (ear to top of head) must be measured, but here are the average sizes:









Preemie: circumference = 12-inches, height = 4.25-inches
Newborn: circumference = 14-inches, height = 5-inches
Baby (6-months +): circumference = 16-inches, height = 6-inches
Child and youth: circumference = 20-inches, height = 7.25-inches
Adult: circumference = 22-inches, height = 8.5-inches
Large adult: circumference = 24-inches, height = 9.25-inches;
, To create a basic beanie, you can use any type of yarn. However, it is generally easier for beginners to choose a style that has a good amount of elasticity, isn’t too fluffy, and isn’t too thick. Aim for a 4-ply knitting worsted yarn made out of acrylic or wool.









The color doesn’t matter, but it is harder to see and count stitches with a darker color, so you may consider using a lighter hue for your first hat.
 The size of your crochet hook depends on the size of your yarn. For a 4-ply knitting worsted yarn (recommended), you will need to use an H








The knife hold (hook held like you would hold a knife to cut something).
The pencil hold (hook help like you’re going to write something with it).

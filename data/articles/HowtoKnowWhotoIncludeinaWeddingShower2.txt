 Couples showers are co-ed, so you’ll need to invite all the attendants across both sides of the aisle. This should include the maid of honor, best man, bridesmaids and groomsmen, flower girl and ring bearer, any readers or ushers or any additional positions that have been assigned.If the person officiating the wedding is a close friend of the bride and/or groom, invite them as well.
Feel free to invite out of town attendants, but be aware they may not come.
 Similar to a traditional bridal shower, you’ll want to invite those who are closest to the couple, without going overboard. Just because you’re celebrating both the bride and groom, doesn’t mean the shower should be twice as big.Make sure guests know ahead of time that the shower is co-ed so they aren’t caught off guard.
Do not invite the bride or groom’s work friends, unless the relationship is especially close.
 Couples showers are generally far less traditional than the typical bridal shower, and some older relatives may not be comfortable with that. Choose whether or not you want to include local relatives, but know that you are not required to do so.At the very least, invite parents and siblings on both sides.
If your list of attendants skews more towards family, you might want to err on the side of inviting more family, so no one feels excluded.
 Oftentimes, couples showers are planned by the couple themselves, but if you're planning the shower for them, don't forget to include them when you send out invitations.


Some planners prefer to use different invites for the men and women. This is not necessary, but it is a nice touch if you're so inclined.
If the shower is a surprise for the couple, do not send the invite in advance. Save it and present it to them at or after the shower as a keepsake.

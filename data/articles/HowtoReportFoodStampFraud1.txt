 Before you report your suspicions, make sure you have sufficient details to ensure an effective investigation.


Helpful information to include in your report includes the names and addresses of individuals involved, the name and contact information of any retailer involved, and the specific acts you believe are fraudulent.For example, if you start a new job at a convenience store and observe a co-worker exchanging cash for a customer's EBT card, this act typically meets the definition of fraud.;
, Having a basic understanding of fraudulent and abusive activity can keep you from making false accusations.


Retailers may be guilty of fraud if employees knowingly buy SNAP benefits for cash, or if they sell food in exchange for SNAP benefits that is ineligible for the program.For example, employees of a Detroit liquor store were found guilty of fraud when they traded alcohol, pornographic magazines, drugs and cash in exchange for food stamps. The store was shut down after receiving more than $130,000 in fraudulent revenue for more than two years., The OIG primarily investigates suspicions of large-scale fraud, rather than individual fraud.

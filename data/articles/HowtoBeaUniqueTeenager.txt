 Wear whatever YOU want, not what the most popular girl in school is wearing! Change up your style! Try new clothes, accessories, jewelry! All that matters is that you like yourself, not what other people say.;
, This attracts more attention to you. To be honest, not a lot of people are proud enough of themselves to smile, so do it! Show your inner beauty and stand out girl!

, Be creative, take part in what YOU enjoy and don't let embarrassment hold you back! For starters, try out any of these wonderful activities! piano playing, guitar, any instrument, drawing, singing, skateboarding, knitting. Try anything that lets you truly shine and lets you show your individual self in a great, unique way!

, Let it radiate from you! Walk with more wow! Watch your step! Don't be afraid to talk to that cute guy or girl that you have been crushing on for weeks!! Talk to that new kid that is shy. SHOW your confidence! BELIEVE in yourself! INSPIRE your soul!

, Show people that you absolutely, genuinely appreciate them in your life. To do this, here's a bunch of ideas: (some inspired from a book I recently read)


Say thanks more often






Spend time with people who are shy or think they are not good enough for a friend. These people appreciate you as much as you appreciate them.






Pass out cards. Holiday or not, this is a great way to show just how much you care!






Stand up to bullies. This will make you a trusted friend and a very kind person.
 School activities can be wonderful. Try out for any sports, cool electives and different clubs. Also, don't be afraid to enter contests. You will have fun and give yourself a challenge!

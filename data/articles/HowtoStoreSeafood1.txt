 Even if your home is only 5 minutes away from your local grocer, use a freezer bag to keep your frozen seafood safe, rather than letting it sit in your car in a regular plastic or cloth grocery bag. Even ten minutes of thawing can render fish unsafe.If your storage bag has been sitting in a warm car, make sure you pick up some ice or another method of keeping items cold.;
, Before placing your fish in the freezer, check the packaging it came in. If you find any holes or tears, wrap your fish in wax paper or foil to preserve flavor and moisture.Direct exposure to the frigid temperatures of a freezer can cause dryness and freezer burn. Do not skip this step to ensure high-quality, tender fish.
 Rather than storing seafood on the middle or top shelves, store it away from other items in the freezer, preferably on the lowest shelf. Although frozen fish should not be dripping juice or sauce, storing fish away from other foods avoids the risk of cross-contamination., Once you have thawed your fish, avoid placing it back in the freezer. Instead, use your fish immediately. If you cannot cook it right away, you can place it in a crockpot or other slow-cooking tool and come back to it later. This is partly due to taste (re-frozen fish tends to have a dry texture and loss of flavor), and partly due to safety, as the thawing process may have allowed bacteria to grow.

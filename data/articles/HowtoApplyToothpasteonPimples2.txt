 When choosing a toothpaste for acne treatment, go for an all-white version, not a toothpaste with red, blue or green stripes. This is because the ingredients which help to dry out pimples - such as baking soda, hydrogen peroxide and triclosan - are contained in the white part of the toothpaste, while the colored sections may contain ingredients which will irritate the skin., Whitening toothpastes contain bleaching agents (for making teeth whiter) which may actually bleach or burn the skin, causing patchiness. This is particularly true for people with darker skin tones - as the extra melanin in the skin makes it more reactive, and therefore more prone to marks and blemishes. People with fair skin may be less affected by such ingredients, however it is better to avoid whitening toothpaste regardless., Gel-type toothpastes have a different formulation than actual "paste" toothpastes, and so may be lacking the active ingredients necessary to effectively dry out pimples. Avoid using, as it will not do your skin any good.
 Fluoride is added to over 95% of toothpastes in the U.S. as it helps to remove dental plaque and prevent gum disease.However, many people actually suffer from a mild topical allergy to fluoride, and it may cause dermatitis (a skin rash) if it comes in contact with the skin. For this reason, it is best to find a toothpaste with as low a fluoride content as possible (or fluoride-free, if you can find it) to minimize the risk of skin irritation., Organic toothpastes are probably your best option when it comes to treating pimples. They contain no fluoride (unless it's naturally derived) and no nasty growth hormones, pesticides or other chemicals. On the other hand, they still contain the ingredients necessary for drying out pimples - such as baking soda and tea tree oil - with the addition of natural soothing and anti-bacterial substances like aloe, myrrh and eucalyptus oil.

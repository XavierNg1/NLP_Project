 You will need hydrochloric and nitric acids. You will also need a filter to filter out contaminants. Finally you are going to need an oxidizing reagent.


Wear goggles and gloves when working with this method.
 Aqua regia is Latin for “royal water.” This solution is used to remove gold from a scrap of metal or an ore. To make it, mix one part hydrochloric acid and three parts nitric acid.For example, 400 mL of aqua regia will contain 100 mL of hydrochloric acid and 300 mL of nitric acid.
Use gloves, goggles, and caution when making and using aqua regia. It is highly corrosive and toxic.
Aqua regia cannot be stored well. A new batch must be made for each use.
 Submerge the metal sample in aqua regia. Stir and swirl to dissolve the sample. Non-metal minerals may not dissolve. These minerals will form a sludge.
 Pour the sludge solution through a filter. The sludge will remain on one side of the filter and the aqua regia solution containing the metals will pass through to the other side. The solution is usually greenish in color and will contain many dissolved metals such as gold, silver, and copper., The nitric acid must be removed before the gold can be taken out of solution. You can do this by boiling the solution. Do not breath in the fumes.Do this outside or under a fume hood.
 The gold must be forced out of solution. To do this, you must use a reducing agent. Oxalic acid is commonly used for this. After precipitating, the gold will a solid that sinks to the bottom of the solution., Strain the gold from the aqua regia solution and dry it. Weigh the gold on a scale. The weight of the gold can be compared to the weight of the original sample to determine the ratio of gold to other metals and minerals.

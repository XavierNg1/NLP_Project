 Unlike a conventional birthday or anniversary, there is no specific day which Gotcha Day must commemorate. You could celebrate on the annual anniversary of when you and your adopted child first met, when you went to court to sign official documents, when the child came home for the first time, or the day on which the adoption was legally finalized.If your child is old enough to have an opinion of their own, ask them which day they would prefer to celebrate as Gotcha Day.
Plan to celebrate Gotcha Day on a day that has positive emotional significance for both you and your adopted child, rather than a day that has only legal significance.;
, If you have biological children of your own, they may object to the adopted child having a celebration for both Gotcha Day and their birthday. Also, depending on the nation from which the child was adopted, their actual birth date may be unknown. For example, some orphanages do not know children’s birthdays, but only record the day on which they received the child.If your family decides to celebrate the adopted child’s Gotcha Day and birthday, plan to make enough difference between the two so that the child does not simply have two birthday-like parties.
 Although Gotcha Day may be a day of fun and enjoyment for parents, for the adopted child, it can bring back many bittersweet memories. Be sensitive to your adopted child’s emotional state, and modify Gotcha Day plans accordingly. It may be most fitting to have a quiet ceremony as a family, in which you and your child sit quietly or light candles to commemorate the child’s birth parents.If the child spent substantial time in a foster home prior to their adoption, you could also take time to light candles in their honor.

 WordPress is available on the WordPress homepage as a hosted blog, or you can use the WordPress platform on your own website. You can add a specialized Tumblr widget, but only on a self-hosted WordPress site for security reasons. If you are unsure, your blog is most likely hosted by WordPress and this section will not work for you.
 You can choose the Tumblr plugin. Choose another plugin called Vuvox Express if you want to create a slide show of your latest posts. This is a great option for a video or photography-heavy Tumblr account.
 This is available in the Plugin Directory at WordPress.org. Plugins are programming that extend the abilities of a self-hosted WordPress Blog. They will help you enable new widgets.
 You will see this as a button in the right hand column of the page.
 This will allow the widget to appear under the Widgets page of your Appearance tab on your WordPress dashboard.
 You may need to drag it slowly so that your browser scrolls up to the top right part of your browser window.

 Using a measuring tape, measure the height, length and width of the chair as a whole.


Take these measurements carefully. If you're spending your hard-earned money on a slipcover, you will want it to fit well.
 Slipcovers are available at most stores and websites carrying home furniture and decorating items.


Most slipcovers range in price from about $20 to as much as $150, depending on the material of the slipcover and the size of the chair.
Have your measurements handy as you shop because most slipcovers will be advertised as fitting certain sizes of chair. If you're shopping at a brick and mortar store and need help choosing the right size slipcover, talk to an employee.
When in doubt, buy a slipcover slightly bigger than you think you'll need. You can always pull, sew, and trim a slipcover to make it smaller, but it's difficult to make a slipcover bigger.
For maximum durability, pick a slipcover made from a fairly sturdy fabric, like denim, thicker cotton/hemp blends, canvas, or twill., Before putting on the new slipcover, you'll want to remove any excess dirt and dust from your chair.


Itâ€™s also beneficial to periodically remove the slipcover and vacuum the chair again before replacing it to prevent the chair from getting musty underneath its cover.
 After pulling the slipcover on, go around the chair and tuck the fitted edges of the cover into folds around the seat.


Pull and tie any strings or ribbons on the front or back of the cover. These ties are added to keep the slipcover tight and secured in place.
Use a tight knot, but not one that's too tight to undo, as your slipcover may change size and shape slightly with repeated use and washing.

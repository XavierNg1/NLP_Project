 A loofah can also work well to brush sensitive skin. Avoid using a synthetic brush, as it will be too stiff and can cause scratches on the surface of the skin, which could lead to even more dry skin. Use a soft brush with a long handle for ease of use and maximum comfort.
 Using firm, but gentle pressure, work the brush in a circular motion over the skin. Always work the brush toward the heart. Dry brushing can also improve circulation., Wash your skin thoroughly to remove any excess dead skin. Use water that is warm as hot water can further dry out your skin.


Hot water strips oils from the skin faster than warm water. Avoid taking long, hot showers and instead use lukewarm water for a quick, 10-minute shower or bath., Products that are designed to leave pores clog-free are best to use. Look for moisturizers that are labeled as “non-comedogenic” or that are described as “oil-free.”Moisturizers retain water in the outermost layer of skin, acting as a shield for your skin. They can protect your skin from dangerous effects of the sun, wind, and various other environmental concerns.

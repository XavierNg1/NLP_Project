 Look your new favorite band up on Google or another search site. Check Wikipedia; get a brief history of the group.;
, Do some research, or ask someone: what is one of (blank)'s better albums? Check record charts. Which singles did the best? To which album do they belong?

, Get the album, maybe even two, but you shouldn't invest your life savings into the music, because you might not like it. Borrow music if you can, or get it through some...other means.
 For the next week or so, you will be doing nothing but listening to the music. Put it on your MP3 player. If you really want to listen to something else...don't. By exposing yourself to the music for a long time, you subconsciously learn lyrics, sing the songs in your head, and learn to love the music.
 If you like the music, keep it in your library. Listen to it when you want. You have just put another band on your list. You can learn more about the band if you really like them, but if you find that you really don't care for this group, just don't listen to them. At least you'll have something to talk about with a guy who likes a band that you don't.

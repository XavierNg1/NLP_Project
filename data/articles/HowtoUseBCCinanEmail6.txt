 Bcc is best used to maintain the privacy of your communication. If you used your To field, or CC to list multiple recipients, everybody on the list has their email exposed to everybody else. While this might be good in a small team environment, this can cause problems when people on the list don't know each other.


Not only does it expose private email addresses, it opens the door for either a flood of responses—most of which will not be relevant to most of the other people on the list—or even being used by spammers.
If, for example, you are emailing a few key people in a workgroup, and keeping others informed about the process, but want to silently let upper management know what you're sending out, you would include all the members of your workgroup in the To: field; include all the people who might be interested but aren't directly affected by this email into the Cc: field; and finally, anybody who you wish to include without letting others know about it into the Bcc field. You can also include yourself in the Bcc: field to get a copy of the email sent to yourself.
Place all "blind" recipients into the Bcc: field. Nobody will see the other recipients, which is great way to maintain privacy for everybody when sending to a public list.
, Bcc is useful, in general, but it's not a perfect solution if you're trying to keep emails private. While there are standards set out for how Email clients should handle Bcc addresses, it's not a requirement. An email client may send the Bcc recipients as part of the header information. Search the help for your particular client, and chat with the online community to make sure your chosen client will send truly blind Bcc emails.

 Pick heartsease when they first open. Harvest the flowers in a "haircut" style, using scissors to remove flowers from the stems of the plant.Choose a sunny day during the late morning or afternoon, as heartsease flowers will droop their heads for protection in wet weather or at night.The plant typically flowers from May to September and will continue flowering after you pick the blooms.
 If you wish to add fresh heartsease petals to soups, salads, or other meals, pick the flowers right before using them. Gently remove the petals and place them in a bowl of cold water for 10-15 minutes to plump up. Use them right away as a colorful garnish., Pick heartsease flowers and remove the leaves from the stems. Bundle flowers together and hang them upside down in a warm, dry, dark area (e.g. an attic). Leave them there for two to three weeks to dry completely.To make tea, which is often brewed and consumed for heartseaseâ€™s medicinal properties (e.g. as an expectorant or diuretic), dry heartsease flowers for immediate use or storage., Deadheading your flower crop will delay the plants from setting seed and cause them to re-flower, encouraging new blooms. Using gardening sheers or strong scissors, cut away stems of flowers that have already bloomed and grown to their fullest. Cut flowers just above the leaf nodes.Harvesting flowers will achieve the same effect, but deadheading is a wise move if do not intend to harvest all of the heartsease that you grow.

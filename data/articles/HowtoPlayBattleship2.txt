 Each player uses the upper grid of her box, without any ships placed on it, to keep track of her "shots" at the enemy ships. To take a shot, pick a square on this grid by naming it using the coordinates with the letters on the left and numbers above the grid.


For example, the square in the top left corner of the grid is named "A-1," since it is in the row labeled A and the column labeled 2.
To the right of A-1 is A-2, then A-3, etc.
 After player 1 announces where she will be "shooting," player 2 checks the same coordinate square on his lower grid, the one with his ships. Player 2 then responds (telling the truth!) one of the following ways:


If player 1 hit an empty square, without ships, player 2 says "Miss!"
If player 1 hit a square with a ship in it, player 2 says "Hit!"
In most "official" rules that come with game sets, the player must also announce which ship was hit (for instance, aircraft carrier).However, many people do not play with this rule.
 If player 1 misses with a shot, she puts a white peg into that hole of her upper grid, and player 2 puts a white peg into that hole of his lower grid. If player 1 hits, both players use a red peg instead, with player 2 putting the peg directly into the hole on top of the ship where it was shot.


You don't need to keep track of your opponent's misses on your own lower grid, if you don't want to. You do need to keep track of your opponent's successful hits, however, so you know when a ship has been sunk.
 If every square of a ship gets shot, that ship is sunk. The player who placed that ship must tell his opponent "You sunk my ___," naming the type of ship that was sunk.


The names of each ship are listed in the set up section. If you forget them, you can instead say "You sunk the ship with __ squares."

, Players alternate taking one shot at a time, whether or not that shot is successful. Whoever manages to sink all of her opponent's ships first wins the game.

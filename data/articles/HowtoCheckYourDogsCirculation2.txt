 The appearance of the gums is an important indication of circulation in dogs. To examine your dog’s gums, lift a section of your dog’s upper or lower lip.It may be easier to look at the upper gums.
 Healthy gums, which indicate good circulation, are bright pink. Gums that are dark red, gray, blue, or white indicate poor circulation. Be aware that some dogs have naturally dark gums. If your dog’s gums are naturally dark, gently pull down on one of your dog’s lower eyelids with your thumb and look at the color of the inner eyelid.The inner eyelid should be bright pink, just like healthy gums.
You can also look at your dog’s tongue. It should also be bright pink, unless your dog has a naturally dark tongue.
Chow Chows and Shar Peis have dark tongues and gums., Capillaries are tiny blood vessels that branch off from larger blood vessels. CRT is another way to check your dog’s circulation. It is the amount of time it takes for capillaries to refill with blood after putting light pressure on them. To measure your dog’s CRT, gently press your thumb or index finger on your dog’s gum for one or two seconds, then release.Your dog’s gums will briefly look pale, then return to their normal pink color when the capillaries refill with blood.
Normal CRT is less than one to two seconds.A CRT longer than two seconds can be due to dehydration, shock, or heart disease.

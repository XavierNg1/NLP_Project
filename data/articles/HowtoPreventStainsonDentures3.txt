 If you don’t want to purchase a denture cleanser, you can also try plain old baking soda. To start, dissolve 1 teaspoon of baking soda in 8 ounces of water.
 Leave your dentures soaking in the mixture of baking soda and water for 20 minutes.
 After soaking, rinse your dentures with plain tap water. Don’t scrub them with anything abrasive.
 Use a towel or other cloth to gently dry your dentures.
 You can use this method to clean your dentures regularly, but don’t do it too frequently. Baking soda itself is somewhat abrasive, and it can scratch the surface of your dentures. Limit yourself to once weekly.

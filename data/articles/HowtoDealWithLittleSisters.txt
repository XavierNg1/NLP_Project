 And you're more likely to come up with a better plan of action before she's gotten on your nerves and got you seeing red. Yes, she will mess up your plan. Just do your best to stick to it and things will turn out better.;
, She probably wants attention and negative attention is the most fun for her. Do not show her that what she is doing is bugging you.
 When she asks to play with you just say "No, I don't want to be annoyed by you". She will soon get the picture that she is being avoided because she is annoying. She will probably stop being annoying so that she can play with you. She will hopefully have learned what happens when she behaves that way and never annoy you again. Don't make your controlling her obvious -- and don't admit you are avoiding her -- or she will act even more annoying.
 Staying calm with her can be difficult but will work, because she looks up to you though she will never say so. Plus your parents will think you're showing maturity when you stay calm.
 Start putting limits. Hitting won't work by your parents, I'm sure of that. Don't act feisty, but be firm with how things should be around her. You need to put a point and say, Look, you're going to start doing the right things, in a strict way. Good Luck!

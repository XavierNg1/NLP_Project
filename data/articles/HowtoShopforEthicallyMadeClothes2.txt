 The best place to start your research is on the internet. Visit companies’ websites to find learn more about their policies and manufacturing procedures. You will also come across many customer reviews that could provide even more information.Remember that not everything you read on the internet is true. Read from multiple sources before making a determination about a brand's sustainability practices.
 If you cannot find the answers to your questions online, consider calling or writing to the company’s headquarters. Understand that you are not guaranteed to receive a response and some of the customer support agents may not even know the answer to your questions. However, it can be worth it to try.
 If you don’t have any friends or family that shop ethically, consider chatting with people online via social media - Twitter and Facebook can be great places to ask others about sustainability practices. Ask them about their favorite brands and why they choose to support the company.
 If you have found that one of your favorite brands is not an ethical business, hold them accountable. Their practices and policies are likely in place to keep their prices low for their customers. Tell them that you are just as concerned about their unethical practices as you are their prices. The company is not likely to change their practices unless their is a demand from their customers.Social media has made it quite easy to communicate with brands. Tag them in a tweet or facebook post to make your voice heard.
 Ethical fashion often refers to company policies. It questions the employees' pay, workplace, and hours. Sustainable fashion refers to the manufacturing practices of the company.

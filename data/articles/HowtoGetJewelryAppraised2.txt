 In addition to understanding gem identification, appraisers need to know valuation theory so that they can appraise the jewelry according to the intended use of appraisal documents.
 Look for professional certification and continuing education to show that the appraiser is keeping his or her skills current.
 If the appraiser claims to be certified by the American Society of Appraisers, then double-check the certification by calling the organization or by checking the organizationâ€™s website.
 Also called liability insurance, errors and omissions protects the appraiser in case an error is made on your appraisal so that you can be compensated appropriately.

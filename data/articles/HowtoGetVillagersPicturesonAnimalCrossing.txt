 This can be any villager that lives in your town. Also, decide how many villagers you'd like to build strong friendships with. This is completely up to you. Are you looking for just one picture, for the top of a table in your house, or multiple, to show how sociable you are?;
, You won't build a friendship with them if you never bother talking with them.
 Don't just throw in a measly Pitfall Seed, even though they'll still be grateful for it. Give them nice furniture, carpets or wallpaper, or maybe even bells.
 Doing those things will not only get them annoyed with you, but if you continue, it may make them leave your town.


If they give you a package to give to another villager, do not open the package. This will make them get upset with you.
 When talking to them, instead of choosing options like "Goodbye!", choose the option that convinces them to stay.
 Sooner or later, in a conversation with them, they'll give you their picture.

 Lubricants are found easily around the home, since many cooking and toiletry items contain a lubricant you are certainly familiar with: oil. 








Lubricants can include, but are not limited to, toothpaste, cooking oil, hair mousse, WD-40, cold cream, vaseline, hair silicone, and adhesive remover.










A small piece of foil will also work to keep slippery products from spreading across your head.
 Most lubricants, like oil, can be poured on or squeezed on. Work it into the area surrounding the gum using your fingers, and then draw your fingers through the entire affected area.








Try not to squeeze the gum too much until the area around it is completely covered in oil. If you move the gum around too soon, you will spread the mess.
 After you work lubricants into your hair, a wide-toothed comb should be able to slide the gum out. Clean the comb frequently, as gum may stick to it.









Before shampooing lubricants out of your hair, use a soft cloth to soak up and get rid of any remaining oil or slippery substance.
 Some lubricating products have a strong smell. Be sure to shampoo liberally after you get the gum out of your hair.

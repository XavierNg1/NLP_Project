 Adding a dash of salt to your coffee can help to suppress the bitterness in the coffee and enhance the coffee’s flavor. This is because sodium chloride, or table salt, makes the sodium in coffee more distinct, resulting in coffee that tastes less bitter. You can add a dash of salt to freshly brewed coffee to cut down on the bitterness.You can use common table salt for this method.
Keep in mind that adding a small amount of salt to your coffee will not make it taste more salty or ruin the underlying flavors in the coffee.;
, Another easy option is to add cream or milk to your coffee to cut down on the bitterness. This may be a good option if you tend to drink your coffee with cream or milk and want to have a more neutral taste. The fat content in cream and milk can counteract the bitterness in the coffee.If you tend to drink your coffee black, but want to try this method, you can try adding a spoonful of cream or milk and taste the coffee to see if it is to your liking. You may then add more cream or milk if the coffee is still too bitter.
 If you don’t mind counteracting bitterness with sweetness, adding sugar to your coffee may be the way to go. Put a teaspoon of sugar in your coffee to cut down on the bitterness and give your coffee a sweeter taste.You can use white sugar or brown sugar for this method. Cane sugar tends to have less additives so it may be the better option.

 Silk burns easily, so don't make the iron too warm.;
,, Put a cloth over the silk. For example, a thin towel.
 Don't leave the iron on any one spot for too long.


If you need a little dampness, spray water gently on the towel or cloth.
 This will remove any final wrinkles.


Turn the silk fabric the right way out to dry.

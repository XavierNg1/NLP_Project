 As you scroll, you’ll likely notice posts that you’d rather not see – posts from friends, event announcements, or just app activities.
 When you see something you’d like to get off your news feed, hover your mouse over it. Click the arrow that appears at the upper right-hand corner of the post.



You can also use this technique for hiding ads and other unwanted activity.
 Keep scrolling through your news feed, and follow these steps as many times as you want, until you’ve hidden everything annoying from your news feed.

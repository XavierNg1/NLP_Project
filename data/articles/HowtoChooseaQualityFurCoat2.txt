Look for a trendy cut or colored fur if you want to make a fashion statement.
Buy a more traditional fur coat if you want it as a long-lasting investment piece.



Go with rabbit, fox, sable, or chinchilla if selecting a trendy design.
Consider warm wolf or coyote if interested in wearing your coat for outdoor activities in cold weather.
Choose mink for a blend of both style and weather-resistance.
 Each type of fur comes in a variety of colors. Decide on a color before you go shopping so you can narrow your search.


Pick between natural shades of brown or tan for a natural rabbit fur coat.
Choose from red, silver, white and black, or blue—which is actually white with minor black highlights—if selecting a fox fur.
Look for slate blue or silver if going for chinchilla fur.
Decide from a vast array of colors if going with mink fur. Natural mink fur is available in a shade of black known as "ranch mink," as well as various shades of brown, white, and gray.
Alternatively, pick nearly any color you can think of if interested in buying dyed rabbit or mink fur.
 This will also narrow your search.


Go with a full-length coat if you want to wear it for formal occasions.
Consider a three-quarter length coat for a trendy coat capable of being worn both casually and formally.
Opt for a shorter, snugger coat for outdoor activities.
 Know how much you can afford to spend, and buy the highest quality coat you can afford based on that amount. Quality mink coats tend to be expensive, but you can find other high-quality furs, such as sheared beaver, at a lower price.

 Paella pans are wide, metal pans that can be used on the stove or on a grill. Pour in the olive oil and heat it over medium heat on a burner or an outdoor grill.;
, Add the chopped onions first, cooking them until they become translucent.Next add the bell peppers and sauté until they're bright and slightly soft.
 Lower the heat first, so the garlic won't burn, then sprinkle it over the onions and peppers. Let the mixture cook for another 2 minutes.
 sauté the pieces on one side for three minutes, then turn them over to sauté the other side. Cook them long enough to impart their flavor to the base, but not so long that they're entirely cooked through.


Stir the squid to keep the pieces from sticking to the bottom of the pan.






Add a little more oil to the pan if the squid starts to stick before it's finished sauteing.

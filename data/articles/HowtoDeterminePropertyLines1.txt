 When properties are surveyed, metal markers may be placed in soil to signify boundaries. These are often left in place at the corners of property lots. If you have such markers, your property may comprise the area encompassed by them.


Most typically, these markers are made of metal rods ¾” wide and about 18” long.Newer ones may have plastic caps.Keep in mind that these metal markers might have been buried, moved, or destroyed over time.
You can use a metal detector to help you determine if your property has metal boundary markers.Sweep the metal detector near where you think the corners of your lot are. If you find what may be a metal boundary marker, use a spade to dig up the soil and check.;
, Wooden stakes, concrete blocks, piles of rocks, and other objects may also be used as markers for property boundaries.These may be placed at the corners of your property lot.


These types of markers are not necessarily accurate. For instance, piles of rocks may be moved, while wooden stakes may be used for various purposes in surveying, and not just for marking corner boundaries., Sometimes, property boundaries are signified by fences, tree lines, walls, etc. If your property is totally or partially surrounded by such a boundary, it may fall along the property line(s). On the other hand, fences and walls might have been moved away from your property line, while tree lines may not fall exactly along them.


If your property is wooded, you may see lines of “blazed” trees, which can indicate a property line. Blazed trees have slashes in their trunks (often painted) so that they can be easily identified.

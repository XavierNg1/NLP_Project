 Cotton is more absorbent than most synthetic fibers, so it makes a better material to use for a cloth diaper.


Use a short sleeve or three-quarter-length sleeve for best results. A three-quarter length sleeve may make it easier to pin the diaper on larger babies and toddlers, but may be more material than you need for smaller babies.
Choose a size based on the size of your child. An older baby or toddler may need a large or extra large shirt, but a newborn would likely only need a small.;
, You can do this on the floor or on any other large working surface. Lay it so the sleeves are at the top.
 The bottom of the shirt should be folded over about 1/3 of the way, and the seam where the sleeve meets the body of the shirt should be just below the center of the neckline. Keep the sleeve of the shirt pointed outward.
 This side should be identical to the fold made on the first side, so that the shirt is folded into thirds. Keep the sleeve pointed outwards. At this point, you should be left with a "t" or cross shape.
 Bring the part of the t-shirt extending above the sleeves down over the sleeves. The upper part of the lowercase "t" shape should be folded all the way over, creating a capital "T" shape.
 Take the bottom portion of the shirt and draw it up to the bottom sleeve line. Essentially, you are making a fold that shortens the length of the shirt by half. You will still have a capital "T" shape, but it will be a shorter "T."

, Sit the baby on the part of the shirt that starts just below the sleeves. Bring the bottom portion of the diaper up and over the front of your baby, and wrap the sleeves around the back and to the front. Pin the sleeves to the front using a diaper pin.

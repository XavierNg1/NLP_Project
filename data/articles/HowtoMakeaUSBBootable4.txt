 This file is available for free from the developers here. The UBCD is a collection of diagnostic tools that can be run before the operating system loads. Having them all on one thumb drive makes for a convenient PC repair tool. You will also need the Universal USB Installer, which can be found here. Place the Universal USB Installer in the same folder as the UBCD .iso file.
 Select Ultimate Boot CD from the menu. Make sure that the directory in the field is correct. Select the correct drive letter for your USB flash drive. Click the Create button.
 After the USB is done being created, youâ€™re ready to boot from the drive and run the diagnostic tool.

 This method is useful for starting improvised lanyards on the fly when you need them quickly. One or more of these "stopper knots" can make a lanyard out of a simple strap or length of rope.


Overhand knots can be used to add extra grip to a potential lanyard.
Overhand knots can also be incorporated into more complicated lanyard-starting methods., Place the bight anywhere along your lanyard cord you would like to have an overhand knot. When you've finished, your knot will be roughly at the bight's apex. The free ends don't need to be even, but they should be parallel to each other.In knot-tying, a bight is a U-shaped loop on the cord.
 Draw one side over the other. Wrap the working cord around the opposite side. Pull its end back around through the bight, which should now be a loop., Pull each end at the same time.When working further on your lanyard, you may choose to add more overhand knots along the cord or over top the first to further strengthen its grip. Keep in mind that this is a "jamming" knot and will be incredibly difficult to untie.

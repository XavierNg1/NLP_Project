 If you still live at home with your mom, then making sure that your room is clean is also a good way to cheer up your mom. You can tidy up your bedroom without being asked to do so and then she will be surprised the next time she comes into your room.


You can also tidy up other areas of the house without being asked. For example, you mom might appreciate it if you tidy up the bathroom, living room, or kitchen.
 Your mom probably has lots of different household chores that she has to do each day. These might include doing dishes, vacuuming, dusting furniture, feeding and cleaning up after pets, or taking out the trash. Identify one or more of these chores that you can safely do and do it without tell her.After you finish the chore, you can tell her that the chore is complete. She will probably be grateful for your help.
 If you are old enough to cook and you know how to cook something that your mom likes to eat, then offer to make dinner for her. This does not need to be an elaborate meal. You can just make something simple so that she will not have to cook.


For example, if you know how to make mac and cheese, then make a batch for dinner and pair it with some carrot sticks or a salad.
 If you are not sure what you can do to help out your mom and make her feel better, then you can also ask her. She will probably appreciate the consideration and be willing to suggest something that would really help her out.


Try saying, “Mom, I want to help out around the house. What can I do?”

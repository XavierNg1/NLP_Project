, The inside paper must be blue, so that it looks like water. The outside of the pool can be any color you like., These measurements will determine the paper pieces that you'll cut., Glue each blue piece into place, taking care to match up the pieces evenly. This forms the water., Glue these to the outside of the box. There is no need to add paper underneath the box.

If you want to put in a little extra effort, cut the external pieces into squares and glue in place to look like tiles on the side of the pool.
 If you want the pool to last well, cover in Mod Podge to seal it all and to prevent pieces of paper from getting caught on the dolls when you move them around the pool., The simple swimming pool is now ready for use.

 Make sure your lower body, from waist to ankle, is completely straight. The leg raise is well suited for working the stabilizer muscles in your quads, such as the rectus femoris., This will help you stay balanced throughout the exercise. You can lay your head on your right arm to get more comfortable.


Alternatively, you can prop yourself up on your elbow, though you want to be sure you keep the straight line from your hips down to your ankles., Lift your leg until it reaches about a 45 degree angle. Keep your abs tight as you lift: this will help you stay balanced and keep you from tipping over. Inhale as you lift your leg. Try to keep your leg going up in a straight line, rather than letting it drift to either side., Continue tightening your abs as you lower your leg and exhale. Lower your leg in a straight line until it touches your other leg.


Inhaling as you lift and exhaling as you bring your leg back down helps control your breathing. Proper breathing is key for efficient exercise., This rep range is ideal for increasing strength and size in your quads.


If this rep range is too easy for you, try raising and lowering your leg more slowly. The more time your leg spends moving, the harder the movement.
If you’re more concerned about muscular endurance than strength, aim for the 15-20 rep range rather than 10-15., You’ll essentially be following the same steps, just reversed.


Once you’ve completed a set of 10-15 reps with each leg, roll over on your right side and start the next set. Ideally you’ll want to do 2-3 sets of this exercise for each leg.

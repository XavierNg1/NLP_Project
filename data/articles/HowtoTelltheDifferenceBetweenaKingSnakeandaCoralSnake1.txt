 Determine if red and yellow rings are touching; if so, this is a venomous coral snake.This simple color check is the easiest way to tell the difference between a coral snake and a scarlet king snake in the US.


On a coral snake, the ring pattern is red, yellow, black, yellow, red.
In the case of a scarlet king snake, the ring pattern is red, black, yellow, black, red, or maybe blue.;
, The venomous coral snake's tail has only black and yellow bands with no red. The non-venomous scarlet king snake's band pattern remains the same throughout the length of his body.
 Determine if its head is yellow and black or red and black. The coral snake's head is black, with a short snout. The scarlet king snake's head is mostly red with an elongated snout.
 People who live in regions where coral and scarlet king snakes are common have made up these easy-to-remember rhymes to help figure out which is which:


Red touches yellow, kills a fellow. Red touches black, friend of Jack.
Red touches yellow, kills a fellow. Red touches black, venom lack.
Red touches yellow, death says hello. Black touches red, keep your head.
Yellow touches red, you'll be dead. Red touches black, eat Cracker Jacks.
Red touches yellow, you're a dead fellow. Red touches black you're all right Jack.
 The suggestions in this article only reliably apply to coral snakes native to North America: Micrurus fulvius (Eastern or common coral snake), Micrurus tener (Texas coral snake), and Micruroides euryxanthus (Arizona coral snake), found in the southern and western United States.


Unfortunately, elsewhere in the world, the patterning can be quite different and no assumptions can be made about venomous or non-venomous natures of the snake without knowing the actual snake's species.
This means that they rhymes don't apply to coral snakes elsewhere, nor to the snakes that mimic them.

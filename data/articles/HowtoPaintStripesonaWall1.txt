 Stripes can be thick or thin, horizontal or vertical, or patterned in various ways.;
, Taping is the trickiest part of painting stripes on walls because of the tendency for the paint to bleed under the tape.


Use low-tack painter's tape and seal each tape edge with a thin coat of the wall's base color to prevent paint from seeping under the tape. Let it dry before beginning to paint the stripes.
 Know which colors blends well and don't. Do you want your color to make the room bold, inviting, warm, cool, contemplative, or anything between?


Monochromatic schemes are similar tonal combinations that use several shades of a single color for a subtle scheme. This scheme is accomplished by adding black and white to the original color to slightly alter the hue.
Analogous schemes combine colors that are similar in tone and feel but are not the same hue. For example, orange, yellow, and green would be an analogous scheme that creates a soft contrast.
Contrast schemes are composed of colors dissimilar in hue from each other. This adventurous yet balanced palate might combine three hues evenly spaced apart from each other on the color wheel.
Complementary schemes use two hues opposite one another on the color wheel for an intense variation that livens up any room. One example of such a scheme is blue and orange.
 The smaller the roller, the more control you have over where the paint goes. Rollers create a smoother, fuller finish than paint brushes.

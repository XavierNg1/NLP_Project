 The first step in figuring out whether you should work at home is exploring the possibility with your current employer. Many employers already have work-from-home policies in place, and you can explore these options with the help of your supervisor and your company’s human resources department., There are endless possibilities for working from home in the 21st century. Fields like computer and information technology, sales, customer service, marketing, finance, research, and web and software development often encourage employees to work from the comfort of their own homes., Once you’ve decided working from home is a good choice for you, consider developing a new skill set that will help you find employment in a telecommuting-friendly field. This could be as simple as refining your already existing web development skills or pursuing an entirely new degree in a field like computer science.

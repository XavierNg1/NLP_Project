Am I disappointed when they do not return my text messages or phone calls?;

You are demonstrating that you care how they feel about your appearance, and you probably care how they feel about you. Here are a few questions to ask yourself:Do I care more about how my hair looks?
Do I spend more time deciding what clothing to wear?
Am I wearing more perfume or cologne?

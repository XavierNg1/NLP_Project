 Everybody is different, and that is what makes you so special and unique. Many would envy having such a small butt, as a large butt can be a problem for some girls who often go on diets to cut their size down.;
, Privately look in a full-length mirror at home with and without clothes on. You may be pleasantly surprised to see that you do not have any major shortcomings with your butt or otherwise.
 You may not have a big butt, but are there some other interesting facets with your shape? Do you have a small waist and/or long legs? You can use such features to your advantage by dressing to suit your shape.



If you have long legs, you can wear skirts or cute shorts to show them off.
If you have a nice waist, try wearing belts to emphasize this.
 Follow an exercise program for all-over fitness whether it is aerobics or weight-training. Walking is very beneficial. In addition, add some exercises especially geared toward your glute muscle development.
, Shape rather than size is often a better criteria for judging your butt, and often shape can be improved through exercise and nutrition. Are you thin all over? If so, you could add some extra calories every day which would result in a bigger butt.
 These guys are looking at a girl with eyes seeing the total package and are not concentrating on just one limited area. Girls with small butts often look more fit and athletic than some others.

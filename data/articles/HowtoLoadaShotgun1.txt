 This is always the first step when loading or handling any gun. Consult your weapon's instruction manual to locate the safety feature.;
, Common shotgun sizes are 10, 12, 16, 20, .410 bore, and 28. Shotshell of one gauge may be fired in a shotgun of another gauge, but doing so requires a special tube. Otherwise it is best to just select the proper sized ammo for your weapon.
 You can also secure the stock under your arm with the gun turned sideways. Make sure that the trigger and trigger guard are positioned on the side of the shotgun facing away from you.
 The "business end" of the shell should be pointing toward the end of the gun barrel. The business end is the end of the shell that the shot comes out of and is opposite the metal capped end of the shell where the explosive charge is housed.
 When it clicks, the rim of the shell should have passed the magazine catch.
 You can tell the tube is full when you attempt to load a shell but it won't go in.
 This will strip a shell from the magazine and load it into firing position. The shotgun is now ready to fire.

 Brainstorm your characters and develop a plot for your story. Sometimes it's easier to focus on a good main character and revolve everything around them. Who would be this character's friends/enemies? Who would be their parents? What are their goals in life? What is their everyday attitude? Try to add a theme to this character's life. Will this be comedy or tragedy?;
, Draw a summary of what will take place in your movie. This can be simple sketches since it won't be in the final movie and might even be replaced or cut. Think of these as each page of a book. Don't draw every detail but express the point of each part.
 Be sure to include everything, especially dialogue. Every detail counts.
 Include lots and lots of details. You can even include traits about your character. Is your character the comedian of the movie or is your character something else?

, You should have decided what animation technique you will use by this point. Flip books are cheap and funny, but have several downsides (no sound, limited film length). Traditional animation has great quality, but takes a long time, is not very efficient, and is quite costly. You could always use animation software as well. It's all up to you, the creator!

, Decide if there is anything you would like to change about your film or something you don't like about your film. Cut it out if so.

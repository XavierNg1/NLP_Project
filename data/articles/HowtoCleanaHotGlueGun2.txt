 One way to clean the tip is to simply use a dryer sheet. After you're done with the glue gun, run a dryer sheet across the tip, being careful not to burn yourself. It should remove most of the glue., If you have a cordless gun that fits into a base, the small hole at the bottom of your gun may need to be cleaned out from time to time. Otherwise, you'll have trouble settling the gun on the base. Use a pin or needle tool to scrape out the hole, leaving it clean to fit into the base.
 Pour acetone (nail polish remover) on a paper towel. With the glue gun off, begin rubbing the glue gun to remove dirt and stains. It may also take off some of the glue, especially small pieces of glue. Keep rubbing until the gun is clean. You may need to change out your paper towel and reapply the acetone from time to time., If you think your glue gun has come in contact with germs, you can wipe down the outside with a disinfectant. Don't use one that's flammable. Also, make sure your gun is unplugged and cool before applying the disinfectant. For instance, you can wipe it down with a solution of half vinegar, half water or a gentle commercial disinfectant.


Dampen your cloth with the mixture. You don't want the cloth sopping, so wring it out. Wipe down the gun. Use a cloth dampened with clean water to wipe it off. Dry the glue gun off with a paper towel.

 You need to look your best, so dress in a way that will attract your kind of man. A good pair of stilettos will quite often do the trick as well.;
, Try to find somewhere where the male to female ratio is high.
 Prime arrival time is when occupants are drunk enough not to be concerned about cash.
, This will allow the males nearby to appreciate your independence. Coyly look at the men as you sip your drink, but don't overdo it - remember your standards.
, If you see a guy checking you out, make eye contact and pretend you are interested in him.
, After you get the drink and exchanged a few meaningless words, excuse yourself to the restroom and never come back. You can also tell him that he'd better get back to his lady friends. Always thank him for the drink and then walk away.

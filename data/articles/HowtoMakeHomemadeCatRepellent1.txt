 For the repellent, you’ll need a 2-ounce (59 ml) glass spray bottle. Squeeze 2 drops of lemon essential oil, 2 drops of wild orange essential oil, and 2 drops of lavender essential oil to the bottle.Cats are more sensitive to scents than humans, so essential oils with strong odors, such as citrus and lavender, can help repel them. You can substitute lime, peppermint, and/or eucalyptus for the lemon, wild orange, and lavender if you prefer.
It’s important to use a glass bottle for the spray because essential oils degrade more easily in a plastic bottle.;
, After you’ve added the essential oils to the spray bottle, pour enough water in to fill it. Close the bottle securely, and shake it well to ensure that the oils are blended with the water.It isn’t necessary to use filtered or purified water for the spray. Regular tap water works fine.
 Once the water and oils are mixed, apply the cat repellent to areas that you want to discourage cats from visiting. In particular, it works well if you have house plants that you want to keep cats away from.Be careful spraying the repellent on carpeting, curtains, or other fabrics because the oils may stain the material. Test it on an inconspicuous spot on the fabric to ensure that the spray won’t damage it.

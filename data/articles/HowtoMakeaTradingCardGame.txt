 It has to be an interesting name so that people will want to play it. The name should be catchy and original, so people will want to play your game. (Don't use other card game names, like Yu-Gi-Oh! or Pok√©mon);
, Science fiction, space, fantasy, western, past, future, are a few examples.
 You should base the rules on the background and story, not the other way around. So this step must come before the rules

, Make a good set of rules and an exciting objective. The rules have to be balanced its not too easy its not too complicated. It's no fun playing a card game when there are no rules or too many rules to follow.


Many games have different rules. Some are strict whereas others can be looser. Experiment, and see what is right for you. When planning the game, you must come up with a good playing field. You might as well think of how turns will be lost or gained, how to win the game, and more.
 There definitely must be a very wide assortment of characters. Power-ups, bonuses and health are also several cards that can make a card game more interesting. You can also make "rule-bending" cards that change the rules.


This makes your card game more interesting. These cards may be grouped into types, elements, or classes if the creator desires. These cards must have graphics. Few people would like to play a card game by just looking at words on a card. Hire an artist if you need.
 It would have been a bit confusing if the creator of Yu-Gi-Oh! called his game "A Time in Modern Rome" for a time period. If your game has many different creatures from different time periods, this step is irrelevant.
 Photoshop is a recommended choice. Draw out your templates on the program, then write on the card the abilities, colour, attack power, name etc... You may also draw the cards by hand, but this is extremely time consuming.

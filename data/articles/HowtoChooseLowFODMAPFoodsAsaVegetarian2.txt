Artichokes, Unfortunately, lactose is a FODMAP and most dairy products contain lactose. Remove cow, sheep, and goat milk and soft cheese from your diet. Stay away from custard, ice cream, and yogurt. Replace these dairy products with lactose-free milk, rice milk, coconut milk, almond milk, and lactose-free yogurt. The good news is that butter and some hard cheeses are low-FODMAP, so enjoy swiss, feta, cheddar, and parmesan cheese in small amounts.Make sure you get enough calcium in your lactose-free diet. Oranges, spinach, rhubarb, and calcium-fortified products like bread and juice are great vegetarian choices.Get enough vitamin D by eating eggs and lactose-free yogurt.

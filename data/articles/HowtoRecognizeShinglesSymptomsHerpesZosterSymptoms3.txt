 There’s a common myth that if you’ve had chickenpox once, you can never get it again. Unfortunately, because VZV stays in your body the rest of your life, this simply isn’t true – though once you’ve had chickenpox, the virus usually returns as shingles. Even children can develop shingles if they’re exposed to the virus.


Most people only get shingles once, but it is possible to develop an outbreak of shingles multiple times throughout your life., The Shingles virus is not sexually transmitted or spread through sneezing or coughing. Rather, it is transmitted by touching the shingles blisters or fluid from the blisters.If you have been around someone in the blister-phase of the infection, you should wash your hands thoroughly; avoid touching anyone else’s rash.


A person is not contagious before the blisters appear or once the blisters have crusted over completely.
Keeping the blisters covered lowers the risk of transmitting the virus.
If you have never had chickenpox and come in contact with someone with shingles, you can get VZV – but you’ll get chickenpox, not shingles. (However, you can then get shingles later in life.), Most cases of shingles occur in adults over the age of 60. You are also at higher risk of getting shingles if you have a weakened immune system. This may be due to:Cancer treatment with chemotherapy or radiation
Lymphoma or leukemia
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome)
Taking immunosuppressive medications like steroids or drugs given after an organ transplant

, If you are 60 years old or over, you should get the shingles vaccine to reduce your risk of contracting the disease.Being unvaccinated after age 60 is a risk-factor for most people. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns about whether the shingles vaccine is right for you.

 Carrying for protection verses carrying for deterrence will affect what type handgun to purchase and how you will carry it.;
, There is great debate on which is better and why. Educate yourself on your criteria and chose based on your preferences. Carrying a concealed handgun can limit your options to smaller framed pistols and revolvers if worn with particular clothing. Many people carry full-framed 1911's under a vest and that is still considered concealed carry. Some people believe that carrying openly can PREVENT a crime, rather than REACT to it.
 Semi-automatics can be reloaded quickly, assuming you carry an additional magazine. Revolvers tend to be lighter and smaller, but are limited in carrying capacity.
 There is not a wrong or right caliber. What is important is that you decide if the caliber you select can do the job you are requiring from it. the 9mm Para. has become one of the forefronts in the self-defense market due to it's economical price and the ballistics in short range environments. However, to hunt big game a .44 mag might be a better fit for knocking down a large animal.
 Choosing a holster for daily carry is different that choosing a hunting holster that you will only use once a year. There are many holsters that will do the job, but consider what you want from it. For long use throughout the day, everyday, a good quality leather or synthetic holster will perform better than the $5 bargain at the local yard sale. Very important for safety is that the trigger should be covered. Find a carry option that suits you. Remember that if the firearm is a hassle or uncomfortable to carry you are less likely to carry it. Remember that the best firearm in the fight is the one you remembered to bring with you.

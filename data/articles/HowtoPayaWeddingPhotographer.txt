 Before booking a wedding photographer, determine how much you are going to be able to pay for the service and the pictures.;
, Most wedding photographers will require a percentage of their fee to be paid at the time you book.


Pay the deposit by whatever method the photographer accepts, including cash, check or credit card.
Keep a receipt for the deposit to make sure the amount you paid is deducted from the total cost.
 The contract you sign with your photographer should indicate when you will be responsible for paying the balance of the photographer's fee. Be sure that information is in writing.


Pay the balance before the wedding begins, to avoid having to carry a payment with you to the ceremony and the reception.
 If wedding photography is not in your budget, considering allowing someone to pay for it.
 Once you know how much you will have to pay and when, you can budget as you plan your wedding. Put some money aside on a regular basis so you are not scrambling to come up with the balance when it is due.
 Most wedding photographers offer package prices that will include the actual photography, as well as printed and digital pictures. If you do not buy a package, prepare to pay for pictures after the wedding too.


Select the photos that you really like and buy them from the photographer after you have seen the proofs.
Offer photographs to friends and family who attended the wedding. Some photographers will provide a website, where people can order prints for themselves or for you.
 Even though the cost of wedding photography may be high, your photographer will still expect a tip.


Tip from $30 to $50, depending on how pleased you were with the photographer. The tip should be handed to the photographer on the day of the wedding, in cash.

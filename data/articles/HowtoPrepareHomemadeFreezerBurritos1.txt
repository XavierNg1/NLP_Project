 If you want a heartier meal, pick a protein to add to your burritos. You can go with things like ground turkey, beef, chicken, pork, or tofu.Simply season the protein of your choosing and then roast it in the oven, brown it on the stovetop, or cook it in a slow cooker.Seasoned ground beef is a quick and easy burrito filler.You can also cook a pork shoulder in your slow cooker for a flavorful carnitas.You can season the meat with ingredients like cumin, paprika, chili powder, cayenne pepper, garlic, and lime juice.;
, For some added flavor, you might want to add some vegetables to your burrito. To make a fajita burrito, you can stir-fry some peppers and onions. Although it is not technically a vegetable, you can also add some corn to the burrito for some extra filler.


If you want to spice up your corn, consider using a corn salsa in your burrito. However, make sure that it is not too runny.
 Another great source of protein that you can add to your burritos is beans. If you want a quick addition, you can add a spoonful of canned refried beans to your burritos. For a healthier option, you can cook whole beans and then add them to the burrito. If you want to go meatless, just add a couple of different types of beans, such as black or pinto beans.Instead of using canned beans, you can cook dried beans, which are less mushy and tend to have a fuller flavor. They also do not have the preservatives of canned beans.
 Adding some rice to your burritos adds a nice texture and flavor to your burrito that will help keep you full. Simply steam or boil the rice of your choosing until it is soft. You can add some plain white rice to the burrito or make Spanish rice for some extra flavor.

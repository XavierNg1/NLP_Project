 Stand directly in front of the attacker so that the vertical center of your body lines up with the vertical center of your attacker's body.


When performing an upper-cut, you will need to bring your arm up along this center line until you reach the attacker's chin. As such, you will need to be in a position where you have access to the center line of your attacker's body.
 Use your non-dominant hand to block and swipe at your attacker's block. Keep the hand near eye level so that it draws attention.


Keeping this hand free allows you to defend yourself against your attacker's strikes and also causes your attacker to shift his or her attention away from your dominant hand.
 Swing your dominant arm up along your attacker's center line with your fingers slightly bent, exposing the heel of your palm. The palm should face your attacker's face.


Do not make a fist.
The heel of your hand is located just above the wrist and should be aimed at your attacker's chin.
 Strike just below the chin of your attacker, snapping his or her head back and knocking him out.


Striking the attacker here throws the head back and pinches the nerves at the top of the spinal column, causing the attacker to black out.
Using the palm of your hand gives you a greater surface area to work with in bare-handed fighting. It also protects your fingers, thereby saving your hand and preventing damage to the one "weapon" you have access to in the fight.

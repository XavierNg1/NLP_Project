, Allow it to release condensation before steaming the milk.
 This requires that you meet three stages in succession, namely stretch, swirl and heat, explained as follows.



Place the steam nozzle just below the surface of the cold milk in its jug.
Turn on the steam wand to release full pressure. Then, keep this wand at the top of the milk, rather than under it, so that it continues to "stretch".
Once the milk doubles in size, the nozzle can be placed back under the milk's surface.
 Shift the steam wand to the side of the milk jug. This creates a swirling motion and the milk will blend, taking care of any bubbles that might have formed.
 Turn off the steam wand when the milk reaches 70ºC/158ºF. Knock the jug against the bench if you see large bubbles, this should be enough to pop them. If this doesn't work, skim them off the top.

 Don't complain about yourself, like saying that you are too fat or too stupid or anything like that. It will make others think the same thing.;
, There's no need to go crazy with colours or anything, but a stylish hairstyle is a good touch, like bangs, spikes, etc.
 You don't have to go overboard. If you are a girl, maybe have a couple of bracelets, a nice watch, or a locket. Try styling your hair differently often. For boys, you could have a golden chain, a silver piercing or a single black bracelet, but nothing too girly.
 It might seem unimportant, but shoes really show someone's personality. Converse, Vans, K-Swiss, Adidas, and Nike are all really popular shoes.
 This is the most important. Shower daily and use deodorant. There is no need for you to smell good, just do not smell at all; But a faint hint of perfume would be nice. Wash your face and try to have clear skin, but don't freak out over a few pimples.
 Join extra-curricular activities to meet new people, and hang out with everyone. Don't just stick with a couple of friends. Treat everyone like your friend.
 It will most likely get you into trouble and give you a bad reputation.
 It doesn't have to be extreme, say maybe, "nice hair" or, "I love your shoes!" or, "You have a great taste in ___."

, If you are different, show it. If you like lots of Punk and Metal, for example, instead of the latest pop hits, it doesn't matter! Everyone is different. Respect that.
 Do not bully or make fun of anyone.

 Keep in mind Shiatsu is an unregulated therapy in the UK, but it is regulated in the US and Canada. You can ask the practitioner if they have a license to practice and if they belong to an Shiatsu society group or association, as many of these associations require extensive training and certification to join.Look up the practitioner online to confirm her credentials and to read reviews of her services to ensure she is highly recommended.
You should also share your full medical history with the practitioner. This will allow her to tailor the session to your medical history and your body.
 Try to have a light snack one to two hours before your session but avoid a heavy meal as this can make the session uncomfortable for you., Shiatsu works more effectively when your muscles are relaxed, as this allows your acupressure points to respond to the practitioner., The effects of Shiatsu can occur after the session is done. Staying hydrated after the session by drinking water will allow your body to flush out any toxins.

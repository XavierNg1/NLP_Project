 Many people notice few symptoms of kidney failure. If they do, they often pertain to changes in urinary habits, because the kidneys are essential to these functions. Symptoms include:High blood pressure (especially if it appears at a young age or doesn't respond to treatment)
Decreased urine output
Retaining fluid, resulting in swelling in legs, ankles, or feet.
Drowsiness
Shortness of breath
Fatigue
Confusion
Nausea
Chest pain or pressure

, There are both urine and blood tests, known as ACR and GFR tests, which can determine if you have kidney failure. You will need to take the tests several times over a period of three months to establish with certainty that the results were not a false positive., Unfortunately, the lead test will only establish if you are currently exposed to unhealthy amounts of lead, not if you were exposed to lead in the past, which contributed to your kidney issues. However, historic exposure to lead will not influence your treatment.Conversely, if the test establishes that you are currently exposed to lead, then you will need to be proactive in identifying and eliminating the source of this lead exposure. You should also consider chelation therapy to flush out the lead currently in your body.Lead is not one of the more common causes for kidney disease, so you might need to inform your doctor if you are subject to special risk factors and need to be tested.

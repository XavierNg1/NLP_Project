 Sometimes, the equations will already "cancel out" a variable once you add them together. For instance, when you combine the equations 3x + 2y = 11 and 5x - 2y = 13, the "+2y" and "-2y" will cancel each other, removing all the "y"s from the equation. Look at the equations in your problem and figure out if one of the variables will cancel out like this. If neither of them will, read the next step for advice.
 (Skip this step if the variables already cancel out.) If the equations don't have a variable that cancels out naturally, change one of the equations so they will. This is easiest to follow with an example:


You have the system of equations 3x - y = 3 and -x + 2y = 4.
Let's change the first equation so that the y variable will cancel out. (You can choose x instead, and you'll get the same answer in the end.)
The - y on the first equation needs to cancel with the + 2y in the second equation. We can make this happen by multiplying - y by 2.
Multiply both sides of the first equation by 2, like this: 2(3x - y)=2(3), so 6x - 2y = 6. Now the - 2y will cancel out with the +2y in the second equation.
 To combine two equations, add the left sides together, and add the right sides together. If you set your equation up right, one of the variables should cancel. Here's an example using the same equations as the last step:


Your equations are 6x - 2y = 6 and -x + 2y = 4.
Combine the left sides: 6x - 2y - x + 2y =Â ?

Combine the right sides: 6x - 2y - x + 2y = 6 + 4.
 Simplify the combined equation, then use basic algebra to solve for the last variable. 'If there are no variables after simplifying, skip down to the last step in this section instead. Otherwise, you should end up with a simple answer to one of your variables. For example:


You have 6x - 2y - x + 2y = 6 + 4.
Group the x and y variables together: 6x - x - 2y + 2y = 6 + 4.
Simplify: 5x = 10

Solve for x: (5x)/5 = 10/5, so x = 2.
 You've found one variable, but you're not quite done yet. Plug your answer in to one of the original equations so you can solve for the other variable. For example:


You know that x = 2, and one of your original equations is 3x - y = 3.
Plug in 2 instead of x: 3(2) - y = 3.
Solve for y in the equation: 6 - y = 3


6 - y + y = 3 + y, so 6 = 3 + y

3 = y

, Sometimes, combining the two equations results in an equation that makes no sense, or at least that doesn't help you solve the problem. Double check your work from the beginning, but if you didn't make a mistake, write down one of the following as your answer:If your combined equation has no variables and is not true (like 2 = 7), there is no solution that will work on both equations. (If you graph both equations, you'll see they're parallel and never cross.)
If your combined equation has no variables and is true (like 0 = 0), there are infinite solutions. The two equations are actually identical. (If you graph them, you'll see that they're the same line.)

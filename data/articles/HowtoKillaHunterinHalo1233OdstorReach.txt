 Take a grenade (Plasma; stick grenades work best) and get it stuck on him. After you have done so, it will die (may take two on higher difficulties). Both Frag and Plasma Grenades work, but the Plasma Grenade is recommended.;
, The purple armor protects it, but there are certain chinks you can aim at. Shoot/stick the knees, neck, and back, as their orange flesh is vulnerable.
 Even though MOST of the marines would be dead after fighting a Hunter, they are really a great help. Any marine summons other marines and a Pelican to drop off weapons upon seeing a Hunter.
 Scorpions work the best, but any vehicle works


Take a vehicle, (Scorpion way: Shoot him with your main cannon) (Warthog way: Ram him with your vehicle) (Ghost way: Fire and attempt to splatter) (Banshee way: Fire Fuel Rod, or splatter him).

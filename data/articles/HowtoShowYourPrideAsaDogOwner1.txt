 One of the best ways to demonstrate your pride through action is to set a good example for others. Make sure you always leave the house with the supplies you need to clean up after your pup. Never leave your doggy’s doo unattended. After your dog does their business, clean it up and throw it away in a proper trash receptacle., When you’re out for a walk with your dog, you can set a good example and show your pride as a pet owner by keeping your dog properly leashed. In most places, your dog is required to be on a leash, except in places where dogs can safely be off leash such as dog parks., Setting a good example as a dog owner means respecting those who live and work near you. This includes keeping your dog on your property, not letting your dog wander around the neighborhood, and preventing your dog from barking incessantly or excessively.

 Choose one night of the week to meet every week if you all live near each other. Use the dinner as an opportunity for everyone to come together and share stories and updates about their lives.


Try to alternate where the dinner is hosted each week so no one family member feels overburdened.
If you do meet for dinner at the same family member's house every week, try a potluck-style get together. One person can make the main course, another can do snacks, and someone else can make dessert.
 Plan far in advance so everyone can take off work and make the proper travel arrangements. Choose a location that is the most convenient for the most number of people in your family.If you have a large family, organize a reunion planning committee made up of three or four of your family members. You'll have fun organizing it with them, and it will encourage you to keep in touch.
 Catch up with them during your lunch break, or try to find time to meet for lunch on the weekend. Make the effort so your family knows you care about staying in touch with them.


If your family member is busy and doesn't have time to leave work, offer to pick up some food and eat with them at their office.
If neither of you can do lunch, see if you have time to meet for drinks or an appetizer right after work.

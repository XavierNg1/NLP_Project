 A lot of what you'll be installing is dependent on the version of Minecraft you are playing. Before getting started, check your version number by starting Minecraft and looking at the title bar. The version number will be displayed after "Minecraft" in the title.;
, Forge is a mod manager that virtually all mods use to load into Minecraft. Forge allows you to manage multiple mods at once, and makes mod installation very straightforward. To download Forge:


Visit http://files.minecraftforge.net/ in your browser.
Click the "Installer" button in the "Download Recommended" section, unless you need Forge for an older version of Minecraft.
Confirm that you want to keep the file. Many browsers will ask this about JAR files.
 Double-click the JAR file that you downloaded. In the window that appears, select "Install client" and click "OK." Forge will automatically be installed., Now that Forge is installed, you can try out your first mod. It's best to try mods one at a time, as they tend to break things when you use too many. Start with something simple, like an inventory tweak or a special item. Mods will download as a single JAR file. You can download mod files from several popular mod websites, including:


http://www.minecraftmods.com/
https://mods.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft
http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods
http://minecraftsix.com/category/minecraft-mods/

, You'll be placing the mod file in this folder. the process for finding the folder is a little different for Windows and Mac:


Windows - Press ⊞ Win+R, type %appdata%, and press ↵ Enter. Open the ".minecraft" folder, and then open the "mods" folder.
Mac - Click your desktop and then press ⌘ Command+⇧ Shift+G. Type ~/Library and press ⏎ Return. Open the "Application Support" folder, and then the ".minecraft" folder. Open the "mods" folder inside.
 Drag the downloaded JAR file for your mod into the mods folder. This is all you need to do to install the mod if you're using Forge., When you open Minecraft, the Minecraft Launcher appears. Use the "Profile" menu in the lower-left corner and select "Forge." Click "Play" to launch Minecraft with the Forge profile.
 Your mod will be enabled by default. The way you access the mod's content varies depending on the mod. For example, you may not notice a mod that adds new crafting recipes right away because you don't have the materials to make them.
 When you're on the Minecraft main menu when using the "Forge" profile, you'll see a new menu options called "Mods." This will display all of the mods that you currently have installed in your "mods" folder. You can disable and enable individual mods from this menu.

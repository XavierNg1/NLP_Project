 Look at any supermarket magazine to know these. There will be rumors spread, and anything you say may set people off. And most stars get caught up in scandals, although most are just photo-shopped, remember what could happen.;
, Taking classes makes you even better! You will want a patient yet professional instructor, instead of an amateur, impatient instructor.
 If you want to be a singer, you can maybe sing at restaurants. If you want to be a famous actor/actress, you can go onto YouTube. You can do that for singing, too. Always start out small so you have experience, and to put on your resume'. You never want to just jump into movie/TV auditions until you're ready.
 From there on out, an agent can get you auditions. But if you can't find an agent, then you can try going to websites to get auditions. But you must somehow get auditions. to be noticed and have a chance at getting the part.
 You will not get every role, and that's a fact. If you give up after being rejected once, you won't be big for long. If rejected, go home and let out all your emotions, and go back out the next day, ready to try again.
 Another thing to do is try out for good parts. You won't get anywhere if you are broadcasted on small channels that aren't watched much with a show with an amateur script writer. Miley Cyrus got so big because many children loved her show. Find a part you know you could do, and remember that even if it doesn't relate to you, if you could do it, then go ahead.
 Cooperation is key. Even if you're stuck with a diva who could act, sing, dance, and play guitar practically since she was born, and a geeky guy who talks and sings like a girl, find something you have in common, and if you have co stars closer to your age, invite them over for a sleep over or out for cappuccinos. If they are older, then just be nice to them.

 Think carefully before writing, what it is which you wish to acquire. Then, be sure you want it. When your decision is firm, begin to write. As you write, picture the outcome of your want being successful. For example, if you want a happy gathering of your friends, as you write it down on the paper, you should imagine all of you together, smiling and jovial.;
, Pick your cord, being the colour and length you desire. The colour may be either of symbolism of your intention (i.e., love, so pink; or banishing negativity, so black), or it can be of your own choosing. The length, traditionally, is thirteen inches long. If you choose to use symbolism concerning your intention, a list of colour correspondences is listed under the Tips section.
 Tying the knot incorporates charging, chanting as you tie the knot, then drawing the equal-armed cross and dotting the knot with oil. The chant incorporates "By knot of " and then something confirming the success of your intention. Here is a famous chant by Silver Ravenwolf, one of the best-known Witches in the world.


"By knot of one, this spell's begun
By knot of two, my words are true
By knot of three, it comes too be
By knot of four, power in store
By knot of five, this spell is alive
By knot of six, this spell is fixed
By knot of seven, the answer's given
By knot of eight, I meld with fate
By knot of nine, the thing is mine!"

Disposal of the cord depends on the purpose of the spell. If you are using it for healing or love, keep the cord until it comes true, and then release the magick (by drawing a star over the cord while imagining draining energy) and subsequently burn it. If you are banishing negativity, immediately bury off the lot, far away.
 You have learned cord magick!

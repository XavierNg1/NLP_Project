 Turn on the oven to 350 °F (177 °C).;
, Grease and flour two 8 or 9 inch (20.3 or 22.9 cm) heart-shaped baking pans by rubbing about a teaspoon of butter all over the bottom and sides of each pan. Add a tablespoon of flour and gently tilt the pan, so the flour covers the surface. Shake the excess flour out of the pans and throw it away.


If you don't want to butter and flour the pans, you can also spray the molds with non-stick cooking spray.
 Combine the cocoa, flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the bowl of a mixer.
 Add the eggs, buttermilk, water, oil, and vanilla. Beat on medium speed until completely smooth, about 3 minutes.


You shouldn't see any lumps of flour in your batter.
 Try to evenly distribute the batter between both pans.
 Check to see if the cakes are done by inserting a toothpick or cake tester into the center of each cake. The toothpick or tester should come out clean.


If the tester comes out with batter attached, return the cake to the oven for a few more minutes. Repeat testing until the tester comes out clean.
 Let them cool in the pans for about 15 minutes. If removing them from the pans, flip them out and let them cool completely on a wire rack.
 You can leave the cakes in the pan and cover them with frosting. Or you can remove them from the pans and create a double-layered heart cake. To do so, set one of your layers on a plate with the flat side facing up. Spread some frosting over this bottom layer, then place the other heart layer on top. Cover the top and sides with frosting.

 Dogs with sleep aggression are sensitive to touch or unexpected noises while they are sleeping. To reduce your dog’s stress and keep you from getting snapped at, try not to touch the dog while they’re sleeping.Sometimes, the dog will allow their owners or certain members of their family to touch them during sleep but not others. Even if your dog doesn’t act aggressively when you touch them during sleep, avoid touching them in case their behavior changes.;
, Behavioral changes are common in senior dogs. However, if you notice any behavioral changes in your senior dog, you should take them to the vet. Some behavioral changes are caused by underlying medical conditions that are treatable.


Your vet can do an examination and check for any common physical conditions that lead to behavioral changes in senior dogs.
 When your dog is lying down, you should always call out to your dog before approaching them. Call your dog’s name softly to see if they respond. If they don’t, leave them alone.For example, if it is time to feed your dog, you can walk close to their bed and say their name. If they don’t open their eyes, sit up, or move, leave them sleeping.

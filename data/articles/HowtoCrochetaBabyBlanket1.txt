 Baby blankets come in different sizes. Before you begin, you'll need to decide what size blanket you're going to make. Here are some common sizes for infant and baby blankets. A smaller size makes a nice blanket to lay over a newborn; choose a larger size if you want your blanket to be used for a long time.



Receiving blanket - 36" x 36"
Crib blanket - 36" x 54"
Toddler blanket - 40" x 60";
, Yarns are made in different styles. If you are a beginner, it will be easiest to work with a smooth yarn. Yarn is also categorized by weight, or the thickness of the strand. A yarn's weight determines how big your stitches will be, how your finished item will look and feel, and what size hook you will need to use. It also determines how long it will take you to finish your project. You will find a yarn's weight printed on the package; they range from 0 - Lace to 6 - Super Bulky. Here are some recommended yarns to use for a baby blanket.


1- Super Fine or Fingering: good for light, lacy blankets

2 - Fine or Sport Weight: good for light yet cuddly blankets
3 - Light Worsted or DK (Double Knit): good for warmer, yet still light blankets
4 - Worsted Weight: slightly heavier, but very easy to work with

, Crochet hooks come in different sizes. In the U.S., sizes are denoted by letters. The higher the letter, the larger the hook - so, a K hook will be larger than an H hook. Generally speaking, the heavier yarn weight you choose, the larger hook you will need. Here are some suggested combinations for yarn and hook.


Super Fine - F hook
Sport Weight - G hook
Light Worsted/DK - H hook
Worsted Weight - H or I hook

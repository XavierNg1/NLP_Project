 Set your hazard lights on, turn off the radio, and then cut the engine. Roll down the window, and make sure both your hands and your passengers hands are visible.;
, This shows respect.
 Never claim you didn't do it (if you did), but remember that you have the right to remain silent.
 Giving any reason for the officer to take interest in your case may actually encourage him to appear in court in offense (many defendants succeed in court because the witness officer is not present).
 Often police ask if you know why you were stopped. Contrary to popular opinion, a really great reason for the violation does not help. Anything you say can be used against you as an admittance of guilt.
 If you fail any test and are charged, just remain silent and call a lawyer.

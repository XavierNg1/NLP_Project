 To send a message from Twitter, you'll first need to log into your Twitter account.
 If you're already logged into Twitter, this will take you to your Twitter account's home screen.
 These consist of your phone number, username, or email address, followed by a password.


Click the "Log in" option when you're done. This will be in the top right corner of your screen.
 This should be at the top of your screen in the group of tabs that starts with "Home".
 This will bring up a window with your most-contacted people.


If you wish to contact one of these people, click their name.
 This will bring up a drop-down menu with their name, along with any Twitter accounts that come close to the same spelling.
 This will add them to the "New Message" bar; you can add as many people as you like to this bar if you want to message more than one person.
 This will take you to the chat window, from which you can type your message.
 Note that you'll have to click the "Send" button to actually send your message.
 These should be to the right of the text field at the bottom of your screen.
 This will send your message!


Alternatively, you can visit a Twitter friend's account and click the "Message" option below their profile picture on the left side of your screen.

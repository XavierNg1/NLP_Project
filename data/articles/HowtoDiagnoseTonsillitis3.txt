 The germs that cause bacterial and viral tonsillitis are very contagious. You may be at higher risk for tonsillitis under certain conditions.


If you've been sharing food and beverages with others, such as at parties and other get togethers, you could have easily contracted the germs. This heightens your risk and increases the likelihood the symptoms you're experiencing are related to tonsillitis.
Nasal obstructions, those severe enough to cause you to breathe through your mouth, heighten your risk for tonsillitis. Droplets of pathogens pass through the air when an infected person breaths, coughs, and sneezes. Breathing through your mouth increases the risk for tonsillitis., While anyone who still has their tonsils is at risk for tonsillitis, certain factors increase your risk.


Smoking can increase your risk as it leads to more frequent mouth-breathing and reduces the body's capacity to fight disease.
Excessive alcohol use lowers the immune system, making you more susceptible to disease.When drinking, people are also looser about drink sharing. This can lead to infection.
Any condition that weakens the immune system puts you at greater risk, such as HIV/AIDS and diabetes.
If you've recently underdone an organ transplant or chemotherapy you may be at greater risk., While you can get tonsillitis at any age, infection is more frequent in children than adults. If you work with young children you may be at a higher risk.


Tonsillitis is most common in pre-school years to mid-teenage years. One reason for this is the close proximity of school-aged children that leads to the sharing of disease-causing germs.
If you work in an elementary or middle school, you are at an increased risk for tonsillitis. Wash your hands frequently during an outbreak and avoid contact with anyone diagnosed for a 24 hour period.

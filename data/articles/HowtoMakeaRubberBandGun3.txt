 This rubber band shooter gets its name from the pencil that forms its stock. The bits and pieces you'll need to make your peashooter are mostly common household items, and include:

Pencil
Thumbtack
Hot glue gun or superglue
Clothespin
Rubber band

, Using your hot glue or superglue, attach your clothespin so it is lined up with the writing end of your pencil, with the alligator clip side facing the eraser. Allow enough time for the glue to fully dry before continuing.
 Take your thumbtack and push it into your pencil on the side opposite your clothespin. The nub of the thumbtack should give you just enough to wrap a finger around to help you grip your pencil peashooter.
 Take your rubber band and pull it so that one end catches on the eraser end of your pencil and pull the opposite between the clip end of your clothespin. Aim your weapon and open your clothespin to release and fire your rubber band.

 If you swim or take baths, drying your ears afterwards can prevent infections that cause aches. Shake out any excess water from your ears and then hold a hair dryer a 12 inches away from each ear. Turn it to low heat and dry each ear.Wearing earplugs while swimming can also help reduce the risk of infection.
You can also try tugging on your ear lobe in different places while you are tilting your head in the direction of that ear to help the water drain out., The only cleaning you should do for your ears is wiping the outer ear with either a washcloth or tissue. Do not use cotton swabs, bobby pins, or any other small devices, and especially not in the ear canal. These can cause damage to your ear., Loud noises can cause ear aches. If you are routinely exposed to loud environments, take measures to protect your ears. Wear earplugs at louder places and avoid loud noises when you can. Do not play stereos at high volume and turn devices like iPods and iPhones to a lower volume setting when using them with headphones.Always keep your reusable earplugs and headphones clean.

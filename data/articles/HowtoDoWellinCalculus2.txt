 Most calculus text books begin with a review of functions. A function is generally described as a mapping from one set of numbers, called the domain of the function, to another set, called the range. In simple form, if you put one number in to the function, you get another number out. Some simple functions are:

Constant functions. An example is f(x)=3{\displaystyle f(x)=3}.

Linear functions. These are functions whose graphs form straight lines. An example is f(x)=2x−7{\displaystyle f(x)=2x-7}.

Quadratic functions. A simple quadratic function forms a parabola, such as f(x)=x2+3x−2{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+3x-2}.

Power functions. These are variations or advancements on the quadratic function, including such functions as f(x)=x12{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{\frac {1}{2}}} or f(x)=x−1=1x{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{-1}={\frac {1}{x}}}.
 Calculus rests primarily on the concept of mathematical limits. This is the theoretical idea of numbers getting infinitely small or infinitely large, and then measuring the results. Using limits leads to many of the derivations and other concepts that you study in calculus., As you begin studying the concept of derivatives in calculus, you will learn certain rules that help in manipulating functions and resolving problems. You will need to memorize these rules so they come to you quickly when you need them. These basic rules are:Product rule. The derivative of f(x)g(x)=f′(x)g(x)+f(x)g′(x){\displaystyle f(x)g(x)=f^{\prime }(x)g(x)+f(x)g^{\prime }(x)}.

Chain rule. The derivative of f(g(x))=f′(g)∗g′(x){\displaystyle f(g(x))=f^{\prime }(g)*g^{\prime }(x)}.

Quotient rule. If f{\displaystyle f} and g{\displaystyle g} are both functions, then:


(fg)′=f′g−g′fg2{\displaystyle ({\frac {f}{g}})^{\prime }={\frac {f^{\prime }g-g^{\prime }f}{g^{2}}}}




, As with many of the rules of trigonometry, you want the derivatives to be tools that you can use and not additional problems to solve every time they arise. You will be using trigonometric functions over and over, so you should memorize the basic derivatives of them:(sin⁡x)′=cos⁡x{\displaystyle (\sin x)^{\prime }=\cos x}


(cos⁡x)′=−sin⁡x{\displaystyle (\cos x)^{\prime }=-\sin x}


(tan⁡x)′=sec2⁡x{\displaystyle (\tan x)^{\prime }=\sec ^{2}x}


(cot⁡x)′=−csc2⁡x{\displaystyle (\cot x)^{\prime }=-\csc ^{2}x}


(sec⁡x)′=sec⁡xtan⁡x{\displaystyle (\sec x)^{\prime }=\sec x\tan x}


(csc⁡x)′=−csc⁡xcot⁡x{\displaystyle (\csc x)^{\prime }=-\csc x\cot x}

 Shampoos and conditioners that contain harsh chemicals like sodium lauryl sulfate may irritate or dry your hair to excess. Be careful which cleaning products you use.
 While it may be fun, using curlers, straighteners, and blow-dryers on your hair can cause structural and heat damage. Keep your styling damage to a minimum. Style only when you absolutely need to, and don't overdo it. Shoot to style your hair at most once a week.
 Feeding your body healthy, natural ingredients will go a long way in rejuvenating your hair. Because your hair is made of proteins, and needs protein to develop, it's a good idea to give it a balanced diet of lean protein, leafy vegetables, fruit, and whole grains.


Eat foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3s are found in cell membranes in the skin of your scalp, and in the natural oils that keep both your scalp and hair hydrated. Omega-3 rich foods include salmon, walnuts, flaxseed, and spinach.

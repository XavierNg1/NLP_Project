 To start, take a brush and a heavy amount of pomade. Place a generous glob of pomade in your hair. Then, slick all of your hair back using the pomade to get your hair straight and slick., Set the blow dryer to high heat and take a brush. Start at the back of your head. Brush your hair backwards with the brush. Use the blow dryer to blow your hair forward and then upward. Sculpt your hair in this fashion, working the brush upward through your hair., Work your hair upward and backwards until you reach the front of your hairline. Spend extra time here brushing your hair upwards. Form the hair near the top of your head into a spike bent at a 60-degree angle., To set this spike, take some pomade. Use about a quarter-sized amount and work it into your hair at the front of your head. Blow dry your hair more as you apply the pomade to set your hair., After you've formed your hair complete, mist on a generous layer of hairspray. This should help keep the look in place throughout the day.

 Drag one foot behind you with the toes turned out, so that the wheels of your skate are perpendicular to your direction of travel. Apply some downward pressure with that foot until you've stopped. When first attempting this, try a fairly deep 'lunge' position, Keep your shoulders facing your intended direction of travel, and slide the rear 'drag' skate left or right to compensate for any turning motion or to steer.
 In essence a very fast turn left or right. Good on relatively smooth surfaces, but takes practice to perfect. It is actually harder to do when moving slowly as you almost have to jump into it.









To practice, pad up and go to a roller rink and give it a shot. Once you are comfortable moving in a straight line (knees slightly bent) decide on a direction. Let's say right. As you lean into that tight right hand turn, the lead foot should be the direction you are turning, you almost follow the path of the lead foot with the trail foot (left in this case). Keep knees slightly bent through the whole maneuver. The lower you are, the better balance you will have, so ending more isn't such a bad idea.
 This technique works perfectly when you are moving at high speed and need to slow down or control your speed. What you do is twist and turn left and right very sharply. This will dissipate your forward momentum very quickly.
 This is a very bad habit and can lead to accidents and injuries.
 You can use a friend to help you stop when you are beginning, but try not to get used to this method.

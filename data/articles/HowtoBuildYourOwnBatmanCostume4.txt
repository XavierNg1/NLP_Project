 The obvious choices are:


Catwoman. Friend, or foe? Who's to know. Whichever she is, there's not much that needs to be said about this costume.Be prepared to meet your match, Caped Crusader:
Robin, the Boy Wonder. Make sure Robin is appropriate for the Bat-era you have chosen. The Dark Knight's Robin's costume is black with red accents, whereas the traditional Robin is a little more colorful:
The Joker. Green hair, white face, blackened eyes, smeared red lipstick, and a purple suit will get you most of the way there. Just how ragged you make the makeup and how flamboyant the suit will determine if you're early Joker, or later Joker.
Other great foes that make for great costume opportunities could be The Riddler, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, Two-Face, the Penguin, Mr. Freeze, or Bane.

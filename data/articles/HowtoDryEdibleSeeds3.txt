 The seeds are usually left on the flower to dry. Wrapping allows you to catch the seeds while preventing the birds from eating them.
 Sunflower seeds may be dried in the sun or in a dehydrator at 100 °F (38 °C). Higher temperatures affect the flavor, so keep it low.
 When the seeds are dried, they can be roasted in a shallow pan at 300 °F (149 °C) for 10 to 15 minutes. See further How to dry and season raw sunflower seeds.

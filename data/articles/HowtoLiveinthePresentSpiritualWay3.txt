 Ego is current state of consciousness of humanity; A conglomeration of recurring thoughts and conditioned mental-emotional patterns that are invested with a sense of I, a sense of self. Or we can say, it is identification with mind and form.


To evolve into the next stage of conscious evolution and ensure our survival, we must dissolve the Ego. For more depth read How to Dissolve the Ego.
Just recognizing that Ego is the reason for our distortions and pain, is part of the process to become spiritually enlightened.
 If we look at 'acceptance' closely this shows a spiritual perspective of the clichéd phrase “be yourself.


We have this ambiguous definition of the phrase 'be yourself' but most people don't know what it really means. It means whatever you have, accept it and don't be ashamed about it. For example, if you have a weird laugh then accept it and don't feel embarrassed about it, because if you did then it means you have not truly accepted the present..
This advice can also be misleading as your mind may ask "So how can I be myself?" and come up with a mental interpretation or concept. This would become your definition for 'Be yourself'. Concepts or definitions are no more than stepping stones or signposts to be left as quickly as possible. Although its fine to use concepts in the beginning but realize that true interpretation is unconditional and non-conceptual. Read Become Mentally and Spiritually Emancipated and Stay Rooted in Being for more depth.
 Feel genuinely grateful for what you have, especially for the present moment. Acknowledging the good that is already in your life is the foundationof all abundance.

 Though not a perfect measurement, you can calculate a good estimate of your body fat percentage just using a formula with your height and weight. Enter your weight in kilograms for “W” and your height in centimeters for “H” into this equation to get your lean body mass (in kg):Men: Lean body mass = (0.32810 × W) + (0.33929 × H) − 29.5336
For women: Lean body mass = (0.29569 × W) + (0.41813 × H) − 43.2933
Note: 1lb = 0.453592kg, and 1in = 2.54cm

, Use a technique listed below to determine your body fat percentage. Divide your percent body fat by 100 to make it a decimal, then multiply that by your total weight. For instance, if you weigh 200 pounds and have learned that your body fat percentage is 20%, multiply 200 x 0.20. This is your fat in pounds (200 x 0.20 = 40 lbs). Subtract that from your total weight to get your lean body mass; in this case, 200 - 40 = 160lbs of lean body mass!


It doesn’t matter if you calculate your weight using pounds or kilograms as long as you use the same measurement throughout your calculations.

 The vital thing to remember here is to start small. The smaller and the easier, the better. Your first jump should be more of a mound that air can be taken off of.;
, When you are doing your normal jumps, take note of how steep the take off is, how steep the landing is, and how much speed you must take to clear the jump.
 Start at the required distance up the run up, and begin to run down to the jump backwards, all the while looking back, turning your head in the direction you intend to spin. This is absolutely crucial to the jump.
 At the transition to the jump, you will probably be feeling nervous, and your instinct will be to stop, or rotate. Do your best to ignore this instinct.
, As soon as you've turned, spot your landing, and don't take your eyes off it. There is a basic, elementary rule in freestyle skiing. That is, look where you want to go and chances are, your body will follow.
, Congratulations, keep practicing and soon you'll be landing corked 540's!

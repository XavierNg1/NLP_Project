 Let them know that the band is coming and you are interested. Chances are your parents aren't going to pay for your ticket so you are going to need to save up money.;
, You just heard your favorite band is coming to town and you want to go to their concert. The first thing you should do is go to ticketmaster.com. Ticket Master sells tickets for almost any event and you should be able to find yours. Find out how much tickets are going to cost, location, and time.
 Post on Facebook, Instagram , Twitter, etc. that you are going to the concert and maybe someone else wants to go to. Concerts are always more fun in groups.
 Ask your parents for a loan if you don't have any money. Tell them you will pay them back with interest. If they say no, find another source of money. Mow lawns, babysit, walk dogs, etc.
 You have a better chance of getting better seats for your price range.
 You need a ride. Talk to your parents about giving you a ride. If the concert is in a large city traffic will be bad most likely. If your parents can't give you a ride, talk to parents of friends who are going, family, older siblings, etc. You can always take the bus too.
 If not, go buy it during a song that you don't mind missing.
 Concerts are very crowded. There will always be smokers, druggies, crazies, and drunks. If you are by one of these people and are uncomfortable, talk to security and explain the situation. Most of the time they will understand and move you.
 The concert has ended and it's time to leave. This is a very dangerous time. Lots of people trying to go to one place is crazy. Make sure everyone has their cell phones or is with someone who has one. Make a plan. Tell whoever is picking you up a very specific place to get you. If anyone gets separated from the group, then they know where to go.

 Since corneal ulcers are painful, the dog’s eye will bother him because it hurts. This means your dog may rub his eye. Your dog might also squint with the affected eye and hold it partially closed. The discomfort and pain from the ulcer may also cause your dog’s eye to water.


Your dog might do this by rubbing the affected side of the face along the ground or rubbing at the eye with a paw.To figure out if your dog is squinting, look at the dog’s face. If one eye looks smaller than the other, then the dog may be squinting.;
, If your dog has a corneal ulcer, the white part of the eye may be red or have a pinkish color. The surface of the cornea is usually clear, but if your dog has an ulcer it may have a cloudy or milky appearance. This might look like a film over the eye., If your dog has a corneal ulcer, he may also have a discharge from the eye. The discharge may be bloody or even pus-filled.This discharge may gather in the corner of the eye, nearest to his nose.


Sometimes the area beneath the affected eye may be wet or damp.
 Because of the pain and discomfort of the eye, your dog may have a new sensitivity to light. He may shy away from bright lights, or squint in bright areas.Your dog may also keep the affected eye closed.Your dog may also flinch if he goes from a darker inside to bright sunshine outside.

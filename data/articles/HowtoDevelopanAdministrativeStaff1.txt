 Some employers conduct skills testing before hiring employees, but these tests also can be administered with longtime employees, particularly when introducing new computer software applications or company processes.


Clarify the objective of the skills assessment. Letting workers know that the purpose of the skills tests is to assist in designing training programs will alleviate their fears of losing their jobs or being criticized or demoted.;
, Treat each administrative employee as a person with unique strengths and needs. Engage in one-on-one discussions that explore employee goals, needs, challenges and interests.


Create a timeline for skills development. Encourage administrative personnel to accelerate skills enhancement by assigning a deadline for completion of training programs. Skills development timelines are helpful for both the employer and administrative personnel. For example, an executive assistant who achieves advanced mastery of word processing software will potentially benefit from greater productivity and shorter work days.
 Personnel who work long hours, for example, cannot be expected to spend their after hours and weekends in mandatory training programs. Schedule trainings and skills discussions to take place during company downtime.

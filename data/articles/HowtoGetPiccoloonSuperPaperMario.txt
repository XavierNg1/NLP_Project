 Go to Merlee's charm shop. Jump to the back of her counter and talk to her.;
, She believes Merluvlee has the same crystal ball so you need to talk to her. If you flip to 3d, A guy named Welderberg will make you a pipe there for 300 coins.
 She needs a training machine from Bestovius.
, He needs a you-know-what from Old man Watchit. So go to Chapter 1-2.
 So go to chapter 1-4.
 Go talk to Old man Watchitt,Bestovius,Merluvlee and finally, Merlee.
 The house is by the flopside card shop. Go in, and open the big chest. Piccolo is inside. Congrats!

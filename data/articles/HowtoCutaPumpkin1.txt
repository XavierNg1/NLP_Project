 If you want to bake with a pumpkin, learning to cut it properly for roasting or baking is the first step. Basically, you're just going to cut the pumpkin in half, and the easiest way to do this is usually by sitting the pumpkin upright on a steady surface, then cutting straight down the middle.Insert the knife and carefully cut straight down toward the blossom end, stabilizing the pumpkin on a towel. Push firmly, working the knife down through the flesh of the pumpkin. Cut it entirely in half.;
, It's also fine to cut a pumpkin across the middle, though it's a little more difficult to keep the pumpkin stable this way, making it a little more dangerous. Put out a towel, stabilize the pumpkin on it, then cut it carefully.
 Use a metal spoon to scoop out the seeds from the inside before you start baking the pumpkin. Most smaller baking pumpkins won't have a lot of seeds in them to remove, or they might be easier to remove after you've roasted. That's perfectly normal.
 Baking pumpkins can be placed cut-side down in a roasting pan greased with just a little olive oil, then roasted at 350 degree oven for about 40 minutes, or until you can pierce the flesh with a fork easily.


Let the roasted pumpkin cool slightly, then peel off the outside skin and puree the soft flesh inside if you want to make pumpkin pie ultimately.

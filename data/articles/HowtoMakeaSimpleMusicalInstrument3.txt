 This works well with a wine bottle, olive oil bottles, large glass jugs, and any other glass container with a skinny neck.
 Use a glass cutter to cut a small hole in the bottom of the bottle or jug.
 Position your lips so that you're blowing horizontally right over the opening. Keep blowing until you get a clear note. This may take a while, so be patient and keep practicing.
 Do this as you blow, and experiment with the different sounds it produces.

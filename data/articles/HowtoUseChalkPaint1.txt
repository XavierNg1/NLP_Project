 Chalk paint adheres to surfaces best at room temperature, so working inside is best if you can. If you work outside it might be too hot or too cold for the paint to adhere properly., Spread newspaper or brown paper on the floor under where you’ll be painting. This protects your floor – whether a hard surface or carpet – from paint drips., This includes things like handles, knobs, or hinges on furniture or cabinets, and glass or pads. Use plastic baggies to store the hardware you've removed until you're done with the project. That way you don't lose anything and you can get your furniture reassembled more quickly., Chalk paint will adhere to most surfaces without any kind of prep. However, if your furniture has a high-gloss paint or a lot of rust, lightly sanding it can guarantee good paint coverage. Use a 150-grit or finer sandpaper and lightly rough up the surface of the piece you’re painting., This gives the chalk paint something to adhere too, rather than it just soaking into the wood. Apply the shellac with a cloth pad, covering the entire surface of the piece in a thin layer, and let it cure according to instructions on the shellac., You should do this after any pre-treatment dries but before you apply the chalk paint. Drop a few drops of liquid dish soap into a bowl of warm water and use a soft cloth to clean the surface. Rinse it with a cloth dipped in clear water, and then let it dry fully before you paint it., This is especially important if you’re painting something like a cabinet, since you don’t want paint on your counter surface. Place the tape at the very edge of the thing you don’t want to paint, creating a barrier between your brush and the surface you don’t want painted., There’s nothing worse than starting a project and running out of paint halfway through. One liter of chalk paint can cover about 140 square feet (about 13 square meters). Make sure you measure the surface area you’re painting before you buy the paint.

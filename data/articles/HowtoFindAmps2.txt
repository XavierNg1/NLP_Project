 DC electricity, or direct current electricity, is electrical current that flows in a single direction. If your circuit is powered by a battery, the current used will be DC.In most countries, the electricity provided by utility mains is AC current (also called alternating current).AC current can be converted to DC current, but only through the use of a transformer, a rectifier, and a filter., To take the reading of the amperage of your circuit, you will need to tie your ammeter into your circuit. Follow the positive and negative ends of your battery and the connecting wires to find the circuit path.
 If there is a break in the circuit or a flaw with your battery, your ammeter will likely not be able to gauge (or will not gauge accurately) the current of your circuit. Turn on your circuit to see if it is functioning normally.
 For some simple circuits, this might require removing the battery completely. With more powerful batteries, there is a possibility that you could be shocked, so take care to make sure the circuit is off. If you are unsure, use insulated rubber gloves to prevent getting shocked.
 You ammeter should have come with two leads: one red and one black. The red lead is your positive end (+) and the black your negative (-). Take the wire leading from the positive end of your battery and tie the end leading away from your battery to the positive end of your ammeter.The ammeter will not interrupt the flow of electricity, but as current flows through the meter, it will measure the current, causing a reading to display.
 Take the black (-) lead from your ammeter and use it to complete the circuit you have just broken. Clamp the lead onto the location where the wire you have tied to your positive lead would have fed into its destination in the circuit., This might simply mean reinstalling your battery, but when you do so, your device should turn on and your ammeter should read the current in either amps (A) or milliamps (mA) for smaller current devices.

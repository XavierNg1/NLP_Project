 Either wash and condition your hair as usual, or wet your hair and pat it dry in preparation for this method. Make sure your hair is completely free of tangles.
 Bend over and use a comb to gather your hair at the top of your head and secure it with an elastic band. Make sure it's free of bumps and tangles.
 Take a clean tube sock, cut off the toe, and roll it into a donut shape. The larger the donut, the bigger your curls will be. Place the sock donut over your ponytail and pull your hair through. With the donut placed against your head, wrap your hair over the donut and tuck it underneath, a section at a time. Continue doing so until all of your hair is securely in place over the donut.
 Wait several hours or overnight for your hair to dry around the bun. When you're sure it's completely dry, remove the bun and let your curls fall free. This method results in loose, wavy curls. Keep them in place with gel, mousse or hairspray.

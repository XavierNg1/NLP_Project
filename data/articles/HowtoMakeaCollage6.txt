 You can edit photos in several different forms of software depending on your computer and your budget. Choose a basic photo editor unless you're already skilled in a more advanced version; you can improve your skills as you make more collages this way.
 You might have been assigned a theme, or maybe you came up with one as you collected materials. Either way, build the electronic collage around a central idea, image or pattern. Having a theme will help you to find photos and images more easily., Search the internet for images or fonts that you think will be ideal for the collage. Or, you could scan in old photos, fabric swatches, magazine clippings or other items you would use on a paper collage. Use images that inspire you.


Visit Pinterest for inspiration; simply look for photos following themes that you like, such as cupcakes, horses, racing cars, beautiful people, whatever!

, Shape and color the images into interesting shapes or forms using the photo program's cropping and shading tools. Don't be a slave to the contour of the image exactly––go with what works best for your design.


Additionally, you can play with transparency, clarity, tone and any other quality the photo program allows for.
 Start building your collage in layers. Begin at the bottom, with the digital background, and work up.
 Click the Save button often, in case the computer program crashes. You don't want to lose all your hard work.
 This step is optional, if you'd like to display the image on a wall, etc. Choose a type of paper on which to print the collage. You could choose a shiny, high-gloss paper or a more matte, flat option. Whatever it is, it should match your overall theme and be suitable for the end use.

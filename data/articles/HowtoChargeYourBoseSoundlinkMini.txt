, You will hear a little tone that tells you that your speaker is plugged in and is charging.


If you have lost the charging cradle unit, or don't want to use it, plug the AC adaptor into the wall (If it's not in) then plug the cord into the input on the bottom right-hand side of the speaker.



If the speaker is not charging, take it back to the shop to get it fixed or replaced.

 If you hear of new surgeons or new procedures coming to your facility, ensure you will be getting a strong return on your investment before filling an instrument “wish list.”;
, Certain instruments, such as Needle Holders and Scissors, are more likely to breed surgeon discontent than others if quality or maintenance is sub par. Purchase the highest grade of these and similar instruments, and your surgeon and staff satisfaction will rise.
 It’s important to determine if the requested item must come from a specific vendor. If the vendor name or part number was for reference only, then you have an opportunity to compare cost:


Most of the surgical instrument suppliers in the United States do not manufacture the instruments they sell, outsourcing to a number of companies. This results in an identical instrument being multi-branded and sold at various price-points, creating an opportunity to save on purchases if you compare costs between different companies. Your surgical instrument source should have relationships with many manufacturers to ensure you get the quality your operation requires in its instruments.
 Cutting cost on the purchase of Handheld Retractors, Sponge Forceps, Towel Clips, Dressing, Tissue Forceps and Basic Hemostats will not directly affect surgeon satisfaction. Identify target areas to help your center’s bottom line.
 By focusing only on the instruments you need, you’ll save thousands of dollars. Sets are often designed by instrument companies and include unnecessary parts. For example, when buying a Bookwalter-type ring, target only the necessary components and avoid complete sets.

 Alternately, you can try out the revolved triangle pose (which is also in yoga).
 Reach back as far as you can to make this exercise as beneficial as possible.
 The lateral raise is fairly similar to the pullover, but with your arms going to the sides rather than behind your head, so keep that in mind as you do this exercise.
 Lying down during exercise is a unique approach to yoga poses, but in this case it's highly effective.

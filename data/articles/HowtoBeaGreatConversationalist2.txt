 The second your eyes begin to dart around the room or you eyes begin to glaze over, you have sent a signal to your conversation partner that what they have to say is unimportant and boring. Contrary to popular belief, it is evident when a listener begins to lose interest.
 Maintain eye contact and give your partner physical and verbal cues while listening to them. Nod your head and maintain eye contact. At least look like you're interested to what their opinion is.
 Looking around the room may signal to your partner that you are looking for somebody better to talk to.

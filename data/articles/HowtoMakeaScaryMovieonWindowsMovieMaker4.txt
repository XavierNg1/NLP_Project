 Use Sound Recorder if you have it on your computer and make sure you save it.
 Try something else first before adding it to your collections on Windows Movie Maker.
 You won't be able to do this on Windows Movie Maker either, but you could add transparent, colored paper or plastic. For a fog, you can add some kind of fabric in front of the camera lens or just a grayscale colored transparent type of object. Anything works.

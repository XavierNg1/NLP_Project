 Grasp either side of the hooks/eyelets area and pull the straps slightly away from your back to make room to work with.









If you don’t have very flexible arms or think it would be easier to take your bra off at the front of your body where you can see the clasp, take the arm straps off. Once they are off, rotate the bra so that the clasp is in the front. You’ll be able to see what you’re doing which will make taking the bra off easier.
 Doing this relieves the tension that causes the straps to stay connected.
 Keep the strap with the eyelets stationary. Doing this will release the hooks from the eyelets.

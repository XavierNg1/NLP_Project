 Get a video camera with at least 720p quality to film with. People are more likely to subscribe to YouTubers that have high definition videos.;
, You don't want to cast any shadows on yourself, so you should have a light behind you, and one on either side of you. You don't necessarily have to have huge studio lights, but lamps and a window would work.
 When you're not vlogging in public or around the house, you should have a setting you can always use. For something a little interesting, look at Ray William Johnson's or Black Nerd Comedy's backgrounds. For a plain, solid-color background, look at iJustine's background.


Choosing a background isn't right or wrong. There's an appeal with a unique background because it catches the attention of the viewer, but also with a plain background, because the viewer only listens to you, and isn't starting everywhere else.
 Don't steal ideas from popular YouTubers, or anyone for that matter. Have fun, and think of what you're going to say.
 When you get on camera, don't stutter or think up something on the spot.
 Buy editing software or use iMovie or Windows Live Movie Maker. If you don't edit, you'll lose the professional feel of your video. You can look up plenty of tutorials on using your software.
 Write about yourself and your video. If your first video is called MY FIRST VIDEO, don't say it's your first video in your description, because everybody will know, and that's obnoxious.
 If you were vlogging in public and your camera was shaky, click on stabilise. If your lighting wasn't as good as you'd hoped, pick a lighting filter.

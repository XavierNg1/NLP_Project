 Line a baking or cookie sheet with wax paper or parchment paper, for a non-stick surface to work on.
 Either melt in a microwave inside a microwave-safe container or melt over a double boiler., Spread the slightly cooled melted chocolate from the first bar over the still intact second chocolate bar.

Use a butter knife or a spatula to spread the melted chocolate.
 Place it directly in the same position as the second bar below it. Allow to dry in place or place in the refrigerator to set for 10 minutes or so., These will be used as coating., Spread on enough melted chocolate to cover the bar in its entirety., When set, check for any gaps and if there are any, add more melted chocolate to cover., The mega chocolate bar is now ready to enjoy.

You can make the mega bar higher if wished, by stacking more bars on top. It's a good idea to try this one first though, to decide if you can handle more!

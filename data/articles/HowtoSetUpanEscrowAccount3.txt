 A personal escrow is a nice idea for someone who has difficulty controlling their spending. It isn’t technically an escrow—no third party oversees the account—but you can benefit from segregating your money into a separate account. Personal escrows are used often for the following purposes:Non-monthly expenses. For example, you might be billed quarterly for car insurance and annually for a gym membership. A personal escrow can help you save sufficient funds for these expenses.
Unforeseen expenses. These are small expenses which catch you by surprise—gifts that you need to purchase for the host of a party, unexpected veterinary expenses or car repairs, etc.
 You should go through your bills for the past year and check how much you had to spend on non-monthly expenses. Also pay attention to unexpected expenses, such as the bottle of wine you had to buy someone when you were invited to their dinner party. Non-monthly expenses could include:car insurance premiums
car registration
car repair and maintenance
life insurance premiums
conference fees
veterinary expenses
gifts
holiday shopping
school or tuition expenses

, You should set up a separate savings account (or high yield checking account) which you can use for a specific purpose, such as paying non-monthly bills. You could also set up multiple individual accounts for each non-monthly expense, though this could be difficult for you to handle.To properly fund your account, total all non-monthly expenses, then divide by 12. This is the amount you will need to contribute to your account each month.
You should set up automatic deposit, so that this amount is deducted from your monthly paycheck. If you are paid biweekly, then divide your total amount by 26.
 Whenever an unexpected or non-monthly expense arises, remember to take the money out of your escrow account. In this way, you can preserve the balance in your regular savings and/or checking account.

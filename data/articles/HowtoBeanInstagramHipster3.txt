 Many hipster photos show people outside, enjoying the majesty of the outdoors. Brewing coffee at your campsite, wrapped in a Pendleton blanket; standing on a foggy mountain top; hanging your legs over a precipice; or standing in front of a waterfall, your back to the camera â€” these are all photos that will inspire FOMO in your followers.


Search for scenic hikes in your area, or check out nearby locations tagged by other Instagram users.
 Have a friend strike a pose in front of some street art, like a brightly painted wall. Center the photo, capturing your friend either from the waist-up or full-body. Make the color pop by adjusting the temperature (or warmth) and increasing the saturation. Skip the filter.


Look for crazy wallpapers to use as the background for portraits, too.
Take a photo of just a hand holding something in front of the wall, such as an ice cream cone or a pineapple.
 Visit a coffee shop with great lighting and take a photo of your latte art, your croissant, and the dog-eared paperback you're reading (make sure you shoot this from directly above the items). Or take a photo of your collection of succulents, carefully moved into a pleasing arrangement.


Try the "all white shot." Place something in front of or on a white wall. If you don't have great lighting, lower the temperature or warmth and increase the exposure.
Arrange a collection of similarly colored flowers, or fall leaves that gradually transition from red to yellow. Place them in a line or a grid, then snap and edit so the colors really pop.
 These are all ideas to get you started, but if you are taking picture of things you love and care about, people will respond. Use these suggestions as a springboard for your own amazing photos.

 Learning to love and respect yourself means being in touch with what you need on an emotional level as well as how you feel when these boundaries are violated by others. Determine your emotional needs - whether it is being listened to, cared for, or knowing you can depend on an individual – and what constitutes a violation of these boundaries.Make a list of your emotional needs and expectations of romantic partners and how it makes you feel when these boundaries are respected or are crossed.
For example, if you need a partner who listens while you speak, someone who constantly interrupts you to talk about his own business is violating your boundaries.
 Once you determine what your personal boundaries are, it’s important (and sometimes challenging!) to maintain them. This means making your needs, expectations, and boundaries clear to others as well as letting them know when your boundaries have been violated.


Don’t do something you are uncomfortable with or that crosses your personal boundaries. For example, if a man asks you to pay his phone bill and you are uncomfortable with this, say no.
 It’s important that you are clear on what the consequences are for violating your emotional, social, and financial boundaries. You should be firm and consistent with how you react to your boundaries being crossed. There should be a direct consequence for the person who violates your boundaries.


If you have a live-in deadbeat boyfriend who is slacking on rent, set a clear consequence for him not paying his share. Try saying, “Jim, I will no longer pay your portion of rent. You are crossing my financial boundaries. If you don’t pay rent this month, you will no longer be living here.”

 Do you want to be a skater punk? Do you want to be a prep? or the people who always do well in school?;
, Do you look like the part you're trying to become? What needs changing; a new hair-do, new make-up, a new hair color, a tan, a few work-out sessions?

, What are some of your traits; flirty, nice, mean, bad , girlie, tomboyish? Once you know yourself you can be your new best friend.
 A few days before school ends start talking to your friends about your "interests" such as... "Yeah, my mom is bringing me to the Winnipeg skate parks. It's going to be sick!" "My mother and father are totally getting me a whole new summer wardrobe! I am, like, so excited!" "My mom's signing me up for a multiple sport camp. You know, football, swimming, soccer... all that fun stuff."

, If you want to be a skater, start to skate. If you are a jock, learn to throw and catch a football, run long distances and get in shape. If you want to be a prep buy a lot of preppy clothes.

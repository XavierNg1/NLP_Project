 Pay attention to the plot and dialogue, as well as the visual style.;
, With a lengthy game like Portal, you might not be able to do include everything from the game in your video, but then again you might, with careful editing. You could focus on a particular character in the game, a particular relationship, a specific scene, or just do a battle-themed film including the game's combat elements.
 Check it against other transcripts online, to make sure you have the words right.
 Note the characters' costumes, appearances, weapons, and fighting moves in as much detail as possible. Study other fan videos, conceptual art for the game, and any other resources you can find.
 Get people who like you and like the video game, so they will enjoy the work and do their best at it.
 Sketch out some plans and show them to your friends, so you can decide together what would sound good and what would be workable.
 Digital is probably the best choice, since you can easily upload the movie to a computer and edit it.
, Cosplay resources may be helpful. This will contribute a lot to the quality of your film, so give it your best effort.
 You might need to build some "sets" with furniture and background. Look around your community for good places to do some of your filming, like a park or the beach. Outdoor settings have better lighting, but with indoor sets you have more control over the details of the scenery.
 Be prepared to spend more time at this than you think!

, This is going to take a while, so take it a little at a time and be very patient. Don't forget to add a "credits" scene at the end.
,, Feel free to show "bloopers" as well as the finished film. Now is your last chance to take comments on the film and make any last-minute changes before you publish it.
, (Not sure is it works that way, but hey. We aren't perfect.)

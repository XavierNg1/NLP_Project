 Place your index finger and ring finger on opposite, long sides of the deck, and your middle finger on the short side between them. You're now holding the deck with the sides of your finger, between the first and second knuckles. Keep your palm and pinky finger off of the deck.






;
, Tuck your thumb back into the space between your three fingers. Press the tip against the deck with moderate pressure. Some magicians keep the thumb near the middle of this space, while others pull it back to the corner near the ring finger.
 Move your thumb outward across the card, toward the far corner. Flick your thumb off the card as it moves. This motion should pivot the card around your index finger and send it flying and spinning.









Make sure your thumb is moving along a curve. If you flick it straight, the card may flick the wrong direction or fail to flick.
 It can take some time to figure out exactly how this motion works. Experiment with the following until you can get it every time:









Your thumb and the grip of your fingers should apply moderate pressure. Adjust if the card keeps slipping, or buckles too far to move easily.
Speed up the movement of your thumb for better results.
Rotate your wrist as you flick for additional force.
 Catching the card can actually be more difficult than flicking it, in terms of how much practice it takes. Once you can flick consistently in the same direction, try to catch it with your other hand. It may help to watch the card as it leaves your hand, and follow it with your eyes.








If you're not confident you can catch it, flick the card directly at a spectator instead when you perform. This won't derail the act in the same way dropping the card could.

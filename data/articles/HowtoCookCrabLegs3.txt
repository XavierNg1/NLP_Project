 Allow them to thaw in the refrigerator overnight.


Alternatively, you can also thaw pre-cooked crab legs by running them under cold water for several minutes.
 Prepare a shallow baking pan by filling the bottom 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) with hot water.


Since this pan will be going into the oven, it is better to use hot water than cold or room temperature water. Hot water is already closer to the temperature inside the oven. If you cook crab legs in cold water, you may need to wait an additional few minutes to allow the water enough time to heat up inside the baking pan.
 Arrange the crab legs in a single layer in the water.


Cover the entire pan with aluminum foil after adding the crab legs.
Note that the water can be added to the pan either before or after you arrange the crab legs.
 The crab legs will only need to bake for about 7 to 10 minutes total.


While it is not completely necessary, flipping the crab at the 4-minute mark promotes even cooking. Just make sure that you place the aluminum foil back on the pan before returning it to the oven.
 Immediately transfer the warm crab legs to a serving plate and enjoy with melted butter and salt, to taste.

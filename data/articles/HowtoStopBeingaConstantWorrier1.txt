 If you have trouble stopping anxious thoughts, it may be best to consider seeing a counselor or psychologist. A therapist is educated about the way the brain and emotions work. This enables them to diagnose the source of your anxiety so that you can deal with the cause. For example, a therapist can offer a well-known treatment called Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT) that can help you train your brain to stop worrying.Find a psychologist by reviewing a list of approved professionals on your health insurance website.
Ask friends who struggle with this same (or a similar) issue who their therapist is.;
, When you see a therapist, they may offer a diagnosis of your worry. The type of worries you experience may have a theme. For example, if you fear crowds and leaving your house, a therapist might diagnose you with agoraphobia. A diagnosis helps the therapist target your treatment directly to these areas of problematic thinking.Other diagnoses include general anxiety disorder, panic disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and so on.
 You can take prescription medications to deal with anxiety and constant worrying. Many people get prescriptions for immediate relief, such as the medication Xanax. Others try to take the edge off with anti-depressants such as Zoloft. Most people on anti-anxiety medication have access to both. You can generally get a prescription from your primary care physician or a clinical psychologist after diagnosis.

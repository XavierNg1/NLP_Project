 Essential oils should be kept out of reach of your pets (and children) so that they don't accidentally ingest them.This means keeping bottles closed and out of reach, for example in a closed cabinet that is only accessible to adults.;
, If you feel that your pet has been exposed to too much essential oil, whether by accident or from an application, then you need to get them veterinary care as soon as possible.


Depending on the essential oil your pet has been exposed to, over exposure can cause serious illness, and in some cases death.
 Essential oils come in a wide variety of concentrations. This depends on the manufacturer and the usual strength of a specific essential oil that people use. For use with animals, you want to know the purity and what additional ingredients are included.


This does not mean that you can only use pure essential oils with pets. In fact, a lower concentration may be a much safer than a pure oil in most cases.
Many times essential oils are diluted with other oils, such as jojoba oil. This is a common practice but it should be listed on the label so that you know what you are using exactly.
 The essential oils that are usually used include anise, birch, and clove. The problems with this process are twofold: the essential oils themselves can be toxic and they can encourage the dog to go after food or items that have the same scent.Birch, in particular, can be very toxic to dogs.
Anise, clove, and birch smell too similar to common foods that your dog should not eat, such as chewing gum. Instead, an essential oil such as lavender, that is not used in common foods, may be a better choice., Most often, essential oils are used for treating issues in dogs and horses, and not other pets. This is because most small pets that do not react positively to essential oils and can be poisoned by them easily. In most cases, avoid using essential oils with:Cats
Fish
Reptiles
Birds
Rodents
Small mammals (such as gerbils, rabbits, and hamsters)

 This can be a friend, part of a group, or a person you're trying to confuse. You can ask them for a number between one and ten to start, or, if you're playing with more than one other person, allow them to choose any number.;
, Tell them that that number is cosmos. For example, they might choose six. Since the word "six" has three letters in it, three is cosmos. Tell them, "Six is three and three is cosmos."

, Form a circle and have each person chose a number and find out its Cosmos. See who can guess the pattern first.


When playing this game in a group, it's much more fun to go to higher numbers than 10.

 Another way you can prevent your child from having a meltdown when they get home from school is to create a home environment that is calm and relaxing for them. Avoid having lots of clutter everywhere in your home and keep the noise level down. Tidy up the common area and set out your child’s toys so they are easy to access when they get home from school.You may also try to establish a calm environment for yourself as well, such as lighting candles, putting on soothing music, and doing a relaxing activity before your child gets home. This could then help you set a calm tone for your child when they walk through the door.
 You can also keep your child’s spirits up when they get home by offering to do some fun activities with them when they get home. Perhaps you set up a craft area where you can draw and paint together. Or maybe you bring out your child’s favorite board games and suggest you play a round together. This can help your child stay engaged and work off any negative energy they be bringing home with them.For example, you may say to your child, “How about we get creative and do some crafts before homework?” or “Do you want to play a board game before dinner?”

, You should also encourage your child to burn off any negative energy from school by playing with siblings or friends. Maybe your child has a neighborhood friend across the street that they like to run around with outside. Or perhaps your child invites a friend over to hang out in their room after school. Let them have friends over so they can destress and have fun.For example, you may say to your child, “Do you want to invite a friend over to play?” or “Would you like to go play with your friend across the street?”

 In order to get the best performance out of the emulator, close any programs that you don’t need active. Make sure all the latest drivers are installed on your computer. Finally, defragment your hard drive.
 Run the downloaded setup file. Tell the installer where you would like the Project64 program files installed. For most users, the default location will work fine. Continue to click Next to proceed with the installation.


If you don’t want to install any of the additional software that comes with Project64, be sure to uncheck the boxes before proceeding with the installation.
 You can find the program in the Start Menu. The first time you run the program, you will need to choose a language.
 Click File to choose the folder that your ROM files are located in. ROM files can be either uncompressed or compressed in .zip format. There can only be one ROM in the .zip file. ROMs must not be hacked or truncated, or they will not work.


Use a ROM verification program in order to ensure that your ROMs are valid. These are available for free online.

 Using any web browser, go to www.badoo.com/signin.
 You’ll find this option under the “More options” title on the right side.


If this is your first time signing in using your VK account, a pop-up window should be appeared, you will be prompted to sign into your VK user account. Log into your VK account, and then click “Allow” on the pop-up window to link VK to Badoo.
If you’ve already connected your VK account to your Badoo account, you will be redirected to your Badoo account’s home page.

 To determine if your book is worth publishing, you should read it over yourself with a critical eye. Note if the plot of the book is strong and engaging. If your book is fiction, you may look at how the plot unfolds in the book and whether it is compelling for a reader. If your book is non-fiction, you may consider how your approach to the subject matter keeps the reader engaged and wanting to turn the page.Ask yourself, If I were a reader, would I be engaged by this book? Would I be compelled to finish this book?
Though it can be difficult to critique your own work, try to be honest when you answer these questions. Be willing to adjust your book if the answers to these questions are “no,” as this will only make your book stronger.
 You should also ask yourself if your book has characters that are unique, detailed, and interesting for readers. You should consider if your characters are nuanced and detailed, with a strong voice or point of view. These are often signs of a strong book that is worth being published.Whether your book is fiction, non-fiction, or a collection of poems, you will have characters or speakers in your work. Try to read your book from the perspective of a reader and think about whether the characters or speakers in your book will draw your reader in.
 You should also consider if your book feels unique compared to other books in the genre. Ask yourself, What is the book’s unique take or angle? How does it distinguish itself from other books in the genre? Considering these questions will help you determine if your book has an angle that will feel fresh and original to publishers as well as readers.

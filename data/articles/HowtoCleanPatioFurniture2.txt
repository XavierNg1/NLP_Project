 Clean plastic furniture with a mixture containing a quarter cup of clear dish soap and a gallon of warm water. Cold water doesn't quite cut through dirt and grime as well, and hot water is too intense and can damage the furniture., If the basic cleaning doesn’t quite do the job, clean the furniture again with ¼ cup of dish soap mixed with a gallon of water, or mix in as much as two tablespoons of oxygen bleach. If trying to get rid of mildew, make a bit of a stronger mixture that has one cup of oxygen bleach for every gallon of water., Combine ¼ cup of white vinegar and one quart of water, put it in a spray bottle, spray, and leave it on for ten to twenty minutes before rinsing colored furniture with a hose and letting the sunshine dry it., With a wet sponge, rub stained areas of your plastic patio furniture. Using a non-abrasive cleaner such as baking soda will get rid of the stain without causing any damage. Avoid abrasive cleaners. Abrasive cleaners may get rid of stains, but they’ll also scratch the plastic., Apply a coat of wax paste to the surface of the furniture, give the wax a few minutes to dry, and then wipe off any residue left with a clean cloth.

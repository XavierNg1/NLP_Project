 Stop using phrases like "OMG" and filler words such as "like" when they are not needed. "Totally" and "duh" are also examples of phrases that can indicate immaturity. Work on broadening your vocabulary by reading more books and newspapers. You can also engage in conversations with a variety of people, which will help you to pick up new words. Doing crossword puzzles and playing word games, like Scrabble, can also be a fun way to learn new words., Although girly girls are not dumb or ditzy, negative stereotypes about your sex may make you pretend to be so that guys will like you more. They won't like you if you are being fake, so just be yourself. You'll have a lot more to gain from behaving like an intelligent person. People will take you more seriously, and you will impress people by acting mature. Not only will you gain the appreciation of peers, but also of adults.

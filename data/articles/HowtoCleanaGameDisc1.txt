 Clean the disc if you notice dirt or dust on the non-labeled side, or if your console or computer can't run the disc. Frequent cleaning is unnecessary and increases the risk of scratching the disc.;
, Always use a smooth-textured, lint-free material, such as cotton or microfiber cloth. Avoid rough materials such as facial tissues or paper towels.
 Use regular tap water to wet a small area of the cloth, then squeeze it out to remove excess water.


Never use household cleaning products, which can ruin the disc.
Disc repair products may be sold as "scratch repair" or "CD/DVD repair" products.
 Do not place your fingers on the surface of the disc. Turn the game disc so the non-labeled, reflective side faces you.


If the labeled side is clearly dirty, you can use this same method â€” but be extremely careful, as wiping the labeled side too vigorously can destroy the data on some game discs., Gently wipe the disc with the wet cloth, starting from the center hole and moving in a straight, short line to the rim. Repeat until the entire disc has been wiped.


Never move the cloth in circles around the disc, as this can damage it.
 Wipe the same side of the disc a second time. This time, use the dry portion of the cloth to remove moisture. Take care to use the same straight strokes, from the center of the disc outward. Dry wiping is more likely to scratch the disc than wet, so be extra gentle during this step., Put the disc down with the reflective side face-up. Wait at least two minutes to allow the remaining moisture to evaporate. Once the disc is completely dry, put the disc into the disc drive of your game console or computer and check whether the problem is fixed.


If there are still problems, try the other methods below. If your other games also won't run, clean your disc drive.

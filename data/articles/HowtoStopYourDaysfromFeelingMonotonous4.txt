 At a very basic level, interacting with the people around you in a friendly way will not only break up the monotony of your day, but it'll spread goodwill.


Talk to people you may otherwise take for granted. For example, if you stop at a fast food restaurant every morning for a cup of coffee, spark up a conversation with the cashier at the drive through window.
Compliment people you come into contact with. For example, tell the security guard at your building that they look sharp, tell the person in the cubicle next to you that you like their perfume or cologne, or let the server at lunch know that their service was exemplary.
Try being nice to someone who is usually rude or mean to you., By helping the people you know on a daily basis, you'll show them that you care about them. In addition, you'll alter your day in a significant way by creating a positive experience for the both of you.


Help a new coworker who is struggling with some aspect of their work.
Tutor a friend or classmate who needs extra help.
Give a ride to someone whose car is in the repair shop., One sure way to reduce the monotony of your day is to do random good deeds on a daily basis. If you embrace this philosophy, you'll see every day as an opportunity to help someone else.


Buy coffee for the person behind you at the coffee shop.
Purchase lunch for a coworker who is going through a hard time.
Donate to a charity.
Spend an hour after school or work volunteering at an animal shelter.

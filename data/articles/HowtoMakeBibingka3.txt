 Prepare a 13-inch by 9-inch (33-cm by 23-cm) baking pan by greasing it with butter, shortening, or nonstick cooking spray.


Note that this version of the recipe does not require the use of banana leaves.



Scrape the sides of the bowl to ensure that all the cream cheese and sugar have been blended in.
 Add the eggs to the cream cheese mixture, stirring well enough to blend the egg in after each addition.
 Add the baking powder, sweet rice flour, melted butter, vanilla, cream of coconut, milk, and crushed pineapple to the batter. Add them one at a time, stirring after each addition. When done, continue stirring until the batter is smooth.


When adding the flour, you should mix it into the batter 1/2 cup (125 ml) at a time and stir after each addition. Doing so minimizes the risk of lumps forming in your batter.
 Once the batter is in the pan, sprinkle the top evenly with the brown sugar and an additional 2 Tbsp (30 ml) granulated sugar.


Check the batter for lumps or air bubbles. Break up any lumps with a fork or spatula. Remove any air bubbles by gently tapping the bottom of the pan against the counter.
 The cake is done when the edges turn slightly crispy and the center is baked through. Check the center by inserting a toothpick into the cake. If it comes out clean, the cake is ready.


Let the cake cool to room temperature in its pan.
 After the cake cools to room temperature, cut it into 12 to 24 even squares and remove those squares from the pan. Serve while still somewhat warm, or place the squares in an airtight container and serve later.


If you plan on eating the cake in the next 1 to 2 days, you can store it at room temperature. To preserve the freshness of the cake for 1 to 2 weeks, place it in the refrigerator.

, You will see a menu that offers Line. Click on Line and then on Line Spacing., Instead of offering a few choices, Wordperfect will ask you to create your own line spacing value. A 2.0 value will mean double spacing.,

Place your cursor on the very top of the page if you want the entire document to be double spaced. Everything will be double spaced until you reset it to something else, such as 1.0 for single spacing.

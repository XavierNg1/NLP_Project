 For advanced hemorrhoids, which are considered have permanently protruded outside of the rectum without possible retraction, you need to see your doctor.He or she may suggest you have rubber band ligation, which is an outpatient procedure. In rubber band ligation, one or two small rubber bands are placed around the base of the hemorrhoid to cut off the circulation. Because of this, the hemorrhoid loses its blood supply, which causes it to shrink and fall off within a week of the procedure.This procedure can be uncomfortable and can cause bleeding. This generally starts two to four days after the ligation, but it is rarely severe bleeding., There is a method that can be used to remove your hemorrhoids called sclerotherapy, which is a procedure where a chemical solution is injected into the hemorrhoid tissue in order to shrink it. There is generally very little pain.


This procedure is often less effective than rubber band ligation., Hemorrhoids which are thrombosed, or filled with a blood clot, can be treated with incision. The doctor will incise the hemorrhoid with a scalpel and the clotted blood is removed. Due to the blood loss, the hemorrhoids then heal within three to five days by drying up and falling off.


This method is also useful for other, more serious hemorrhoids. Large external hemorrhoid protrusion can be surgically removed if done within 72 hours., A hemorrhoidectomy is the treatment that is considered a last resort of treatment. It is a procedure performed surgically through an incision that removes the entire hemorrhoid in one piece. The doctor has to proceed with extreme caution to avoid cutting the anal sphincter, as bowel incontinence could result. The area is then sewn closed with dissolving sutures.


These wounds rarely get infected due to the rich vascular bed in these muscles, which prevents infection despite the location.

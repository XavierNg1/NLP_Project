 The method for doing this depends on your version of Microsoft Word.


In Word 2003, select Reviewing Pane on the Reviewing toolbar. (If the Reviewing toolbar is not already displayed, select Toolbars from the View menu and then select Reviewing.)
In Word 2007 and 2010, select Reviewing Pane from the Tracking group in the Review menu ribbon and select Reviewing Pane Vertical to display the pane beside your document or Reviewing Pane Horizontal to display the pane beneath your document.
 Click the "X" in the upper right corner.

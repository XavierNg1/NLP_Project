 When you first lift the sofa’s rear upholstery panel, take pictures of the frame, base, and other relevant features. That way, when you have to put it back together, you’ll know what the sofa is supposed to look like when it’s fully assembled.If you’re unsure about your mechanical abilities, you could take pictures at each step of disassembly to guide you during reassembly.
 Have plastic bags or other small containers on hand when you unfasten any screws or bolts. Place your hardware into a bag as soon as you remove it. Keep separate bags for each base bar’s hardware so it’s easier to sort through the screws, bolts, nuts, and washers.Label your disassembled parts so you’ll know where to reinstall “left seat back” and “top base bar.”

, Line up each of the base’s parts up so their backs face the ceiling. Locate the predrilled holes on the top base bar where the screws or bolts fit, and line the bar up with the corresponding holes on the sofa’s base. Start by fastening the top bar’s center screws that attach it to the center part of the sofa, then work outward to reattach the bar to the base of each sofa part.After securing the top bar, drive the screws into the remaining bars to reassemble the sofa base.
 Place the sofa in a normal position. Carefully slide the detached seat back into its housing, and jiggle it a little until you’ve slid it all the way into place.Turn the sofa forward so the back faces toward the ceiling, locate the locking levers, and push each lever down to lock the seat into position.

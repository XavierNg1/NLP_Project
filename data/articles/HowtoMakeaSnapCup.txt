 Ask your parents or guardian first. Or go to the discount store or Target or Walmart and buy one. You can get one for $1-5 dollars. Pick any color you want, but Elle from Legally Blonde would prefer pink.;
, Things like feathers, bows, stickers, magazine clips, etc can help make your snap cup look awesome.
 Type in "The Snap Cup" in your favorite color (again pink is suggested) and print it out. Suggested fonts include Ravi and Comic Sans. Type it in 75 or higher size, but make sure it fits your cup. Print it out, cut it out, and use tape/glue/or even stickers to place it on your snap cup.
 On each one, write a good thing about a friend. For example "Sam is good at art!" When you see your friend next, you read them the slip of paper and then you and your friends say " Snaps for (Insert Friend's Name)!" So I would have said "Snaps for Sam!" Then, you and your friends snap for that person! It is so fun and can make you feel warm and fuzzy inside.

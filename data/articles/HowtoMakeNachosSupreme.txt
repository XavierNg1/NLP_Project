, Arrange and lay the tortilla chips on an oven safe plate so that they cover the entire bottom. Add the refried beans on top of the chips and spread them evenly. Use the Monterey Jack Cheese and sprinkle it all over the chips and beans.
 Place the plate in the oven for about 5 minutes or enough time to allow the cheese to completely melt.
 Attack your base and spread more love by adding scoops of guacamole, sour cream, and Pico de Gallo around the inside of the plate.
 Be sure to have any spicy food, such as Jalapenos on the side.

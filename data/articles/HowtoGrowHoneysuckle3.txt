 You can start a new honeysuckle plant from a cutting, or portion of an existing plant, treated with root hormone. Remove six to eight inch pieces of vine from your honeysuckle plant with a sharp knife. The cut you make should be slanted as opposed to straight across. If possible, separate the cutting from the vine just below a leaf node, or the portion of the stem that produces leaves. Remove the lowest two sets of leaves.


Take your cuttings from a plant that is at least two years old., With a knife, carefully scrape off the top layer of the stem. You do not need to remove the entire layer, only the portion that spans from the base of the cutting to the lowest leaf node. This distance will be approximately two inches.


This step is optional and should be avoided if you do not have a steady hand., Root hormone is used to enhance the growth of plant’s roots. Place a small amount of powder or liquid root hormone into a clean disposable dish. Dip two inches of the cutting into the root hormone. Tap the excess product off on the side of the dish.Root hormone is commonly used on cuttings, like honeysuckle, that generate roots rather slowly., Fill a small container with fresh soil or compost. Insert the cutting two inches into the fresh soil. Stick a bamboo skewer into the soil approximately half an inch away from the cutting. Water the cutting. Cover the plant with a plastic bag and seal the bag with a rubber band.


The bamboo stick with keep the bag off of the cutting., Once the cuttings are planted, relocate the containers to a bright, sunny sport. Within two to three weeks, the cuttings should produce roots. To check their progress, lightly tug on the cutting to see if it is attached to the soil. When the roots are at least one inch long, you may transplant them to a larger pot or into your garden.


Don’t forget to water your cuttings. The soil should remain moist, not damp or dry.

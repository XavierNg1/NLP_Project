 Combine the milk and water in a pint-sized (500-ml) microwave-safe mason jar. Microwave the jar uncovered for 2 minutes on full power.Watch the milk carefully as it heats in your microwave. It should begin bubbling, but should not be allowed to reach a full boil.
Whole-fat dairy milk will produce the most foam, but you can use nearly any type of milk, including non-dairy varieties like soy and nut milks. Just keep in mind that the amount of foam will decrease as the fat content decreases.
For this amount of latte, the jar should be pint-sized (500-ml) at minimum, but it can be larger than that if necessary.
 Sprinkle the matcha into the hot milk mixture. If you wish to add sugar or honey, do so now.


Since matcha can develop clumps as it sits, it's a good idea to sift the powder into the hot milk instead of adding it directly. Doing so should break up any lumps and make the powder easier to mix.
Green tea can be bitter on its own, so while sweeteners are not necessary, they are recommended. For this method, dry sweeteners like sugar and stevia generally work better than liquid sweeteners like milk or agave syrup.
 Seal the jar tightly with its lid, then shake the jar for a full 60 seconds or until the drink inside looks evenly combined and foamy.


Note that you may need to hold the jar using oven mitts or a tightly wrapped kitchen towel to protect your hands from the heat.
If you aren't using a jar with a lid, pour all of the ingredients into a small blender or submerge a handheld immersion blender into the cup. Process the ingredients for 10 to 20 seconds, or until evenly combined. The surface of the latte should also develop a thin layer of foam., Pour the green tea latte into a mug that holds at least 8 oz (250 ml). It should now be finished and ready to drink.


If desired, you can dust the surface with additional matcha powder or drizzle it with a dash of honey.

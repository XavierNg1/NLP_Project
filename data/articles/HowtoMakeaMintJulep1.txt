 Wash the mint leaves, then drop them into the bottom of a short, squat cocktail glass with thick sides. Sprinkle the 1 ½ teaspoons of sugar over the leaves.Make sure to use a glass with thick sides, or else use a shaker tin.;
, Muddle the mint and sugar by placing a cocktail muddler in the glass, then pressing lightly on the leaves and twisting. This releases the flavor of the mint and will break down the sugar.


If you don’t have a muddler, use the bottom of a spoon to press the mint leaves and rub them against the side of the glass.
 After the mint is aromatic and looks slightly crushed, pour in a splash of seltzer. The amount you use can vary depending on how strong you want your drink. Then fill up your glass until ¾ full with crushed ice., Pour in the 2 ½ ounces of bourbon. Try to use a high-quality Kentucky bourbon whisky, which is the most traditional. Then add in another splash of seltzer on top.
 Use a cocktail stirrer or a spoon to lightly stir the contents of the mint julep. Stirring helps to mix the flavors so that the mint julep tastes the same throughout.

 Due to the cost factor, many startup game studios make a common critical mistake – they hire few specialists to fulfill several roles. As a rule, these specialists are pretty junior and are managed by a single senior guy. Such team structures often fail to deliver quality products on time because of occupational burnout (having to work overtime to meet the deadlines, multi-tasking, etc) and lack of professional expertise.
, Since timing and cost efficiency are really two most important factors in gaining a competitive advantage and winning a certain market or a niche, you should consider alternative ways to staff your game development project (e.g., offshore IT staffing, Dedicated Development Team, etc.).


For your game development project you'll need these skills and roles (as a minimum):

Concept artist:

Preparation of all creative materials including sketches, drafts, creation of characters, objects (e.g., vehicles, weapons) and map layouts,

,,

Your PM / team lead only uses constructive rather than destructive criticism to maintain a healthy team morale,
Your PM / team lead is able to minimize (inevitable) delays in the delivery

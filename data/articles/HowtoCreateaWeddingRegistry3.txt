 Avoid including information about your registry on your wedding stationery, such as your save-the-date or wedding invitations. On these items, simply include the link to your wedding website, where your registry information and other details can be featured.On your wedding website, include all of the necessary information someone might need to find a gift you’ve requested, including the specific retailers you’re registered with, as well as your registry website if you're using one.
 One of the most important aspects of your registry in terms of tactfulness is including gifts of multiple price points. As a rule of thumb, keep about a third of your gifts below $50, a third between $50 and $150, and the final third over $150.Adjust these numbers as you see fit, keeping in mind that variety is key.
If you find yourself wondering whether your price points are potentially too high, you can assume that your guests will feel similarly.
 If you receive wedding presents in the mail before your big day, hold off on opening them. This is important for several reasons. In particular, you may receive three sets of towels, despite setting up a registry to help prevent this sort of mishap.After the wedding, you’ll be able to best determine what isn’t needed, and which items will be easiest to return or exchange.
 While e-mails or phone calls will be tempting once you see the list of people you need to thank, spend the time handwriting your thank you notes. Thank you notes should be sent to everyone who gives any type of gift, whether it is something tangible or a donation in your name, etc.Another perk offered by many registry websites is a list of who got you what, so you don’t have to compile one yourself. Use this list to help keep track of all the thank you notes you need to send.

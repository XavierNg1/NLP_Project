 If you notice that you have spider mites and want to minimize their damage to your plants, it's best to separate the mite-infested plants. Move them to a different part of your garden or indoors before you try to remove them., Water from a hose is strong enough to kill spider mites. Point a hose towards your plants and spray the leaves down with cold water. Remember to spray under the leaves as well so that you kill all of the mites., Keep the mite infested plants isolated for at least a month so that the spider mites don't spread to your other plants. Water from a hose is not strong enough to destroy spider mite eggs, so spraying the plants down once a week for a month will ensure that you kill the new mites that are hatching.

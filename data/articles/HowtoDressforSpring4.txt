 All the skirts you kept hidden during winter can finally return to their rightful place in your wardrobe. Flouncy A-line skirts in floral patterns work especially well, but many other styles are also suitable.
 On some days, the weather may feel too warm for long pants yet too cold for shorts. Capri pants bridge the gap by covering the majority of your leg, while exposing just enough to cool you down.
 A pair of linen cargo pants can be both practical and stylish. These sorts of pants typically work best in casual settings, but you may be able to find a few that can be used for dressier occasions, as well.
 Jeans are a style staple for any season. Light and medium washes freshen things up for spring, but you can pull out your favorite dark wash jeans, too.
 Toward the end of the season, the weather may get too hot even for capri pants. A good pair of shorts is essential for days like this. Consider tailored style dress shorts, like Bermudas, that stop just short of the knee.

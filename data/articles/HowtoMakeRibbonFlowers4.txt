 You may choose ribbon of any width; however, you will need to vary the number of ribbons to adjust for ribbons with thinner or thicker width., If youâ€™re using a thin ribbon, cut about eight pieces that are about six inches long. Arrange the ribbons so that you make a star like shape where each ribbon is layered at the center. Evenly space out these strips and stitch one or two stitches at the center to hold the strips in place., Fold each strip in half and stitch the ends of the ribbon to the center. Continue to do this with each strip to create the petals of your flowers from the folded loops of ribbon.You want to fold the ribbon lengthwise to create two loops at either end of its centre. All loops should meed at the same place, the centre of your flower.
 Glue a button at the center of your flower to create the center. You want to use the button to cover where you have glued all the ends of the ribbons together.On the back of the flower, slide floral wire through the stitches. Secure the flower by bending it in half. Use floral tape to wrap the wire and create the stem. Either stitch to secure the button or use hot glue.

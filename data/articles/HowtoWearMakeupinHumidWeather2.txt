 While shimmery blushes can produce too much shine, powdery blushes can become streaky in humidity. Instead, opt for a blush stain or gel. Use your fingers to apply the stain or gel over the apples of your cheeks and finish with a light application of bronzer.Applying bronzer over your blush is a great way to get a natural, sun-kissed look.
 Because sheer products are light, they work great for humid summer days and nights. Use the sheer versions of your favorite eye and lip colors. Additionally, because bright lipsticks can add shine to an already shiny face, choose a more natural color for your lips when it is humid.For example, nude, subtle berry or peach lipstick shades work great.
Also, choose lip balms and stains over lip glosses and sticky, thick lipsticks.
 Inevitably, your face will become shiny and oily because of the humidity. When this happens, use blotters to remove shine and oil. Blot your T-zone and other oily areas on your face throughout the day.Blotters are great because they remove shine without removing makeup.
Try to avoid using powders to eliminate shine. Powders only add more makeup to your face, which can make your face look cakey.

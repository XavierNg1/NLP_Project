 Most waxing kits contain a pre-wax cleanser, a waxing applicator, paraffin wax, wax warmer, and pellon strips or muslin. Along with these items, it’s also good to have baby powder, tweezers, small scissors and baby oil, which is a great wax remover should you get it anywhere other than where you want!, Shape and trim your eyebrows. If your eyebrows are less than a one-quarter inch in length, they probably won’t be long enough to wax., Wipe the cleanser off with a damp washcloth. Also put a little baby powder in the palm of one hand, pinch a bit out and sprinkle some onto both brows. This helps to absorb any excess moisture so that the strip and wax adhere well., If the kit you’re using doesn’t have a warmer, then you can eat it in the microwave or in a small container on the stove.
 For obvious safety reasons, only wax one brow at a time so that you can concentrate on what you’re doing. If you feel jittery at all doing it yourself, then stop and have someone else it apply it for you. Using the applicator, apply the wax in the same direction that the hair grows. Make sure it covers the entire area; though it’s not necessary to make it too thick either., Leave a little extra on the side to help you remove it. Using your fingers, rub over the strip in the same direction as the hair. Allow it to set for several seconds., Don’t pull up though. Just pull straight across. If any hair remains, replace the strip and pull again. Be prepared. If you’re not used to how tweezing feels, it could be a little painful.To help with redness, put a soothing moisturizer on the brow. Aloe vera works well. Wipe off after a few minutes.
 If there’s any excess hair, remove with a tweezer. If there’s any remaining wax, remove with baby oil. Follow these same steps to wax the other eyebrow.

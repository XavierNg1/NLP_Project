 These are listed below. In particular, you will need to match three buttons in descending size to make each button flower. Choose buttons according to their interest and colors. You may wish to color theme them, or make a more eclectic arrangement.;
, Assemble three buttons on top of each other. They should be in descending order, with the largest at the base and the smallest on top.
 Pull the loop firmly into place to draw together the three buttons and wrap the wire neatly in place underneath the large button, around the wire length. Use pliers to help you wind it, if needed.
 Cut at the end to form the stem. The button flower will be sitting pretty at one end, the other end ready to be inserted into the arrangement.
 Vary the stem lengths to make the result reflect a real bunch of flowers in a container.
 Cut down the florist's foam to size and insert into the container. Cover the foam with dried moss or other floral cover to prettify it.
 Simply insert the wire stem end into the florist's foam in different places. Rearrange until you're happy with the final look.


If you don't want to use florist's wire, find a pretty bottle and simply slip the wire stems into it.

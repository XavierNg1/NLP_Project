, If you weren't able to address a spill immediately, you can use one of any number of standard household cleaners after checking the back label to make sure they are compatible with laminate. If you don't have a solution you can mix soap with warm water, or add several tablespoons of vinegar to a cup of warm water.Most standard cleaners will be compatible. Laminate usually tolerates everything from soap to vinegar to even bleach.If you are ever unsure about any cleaning solution, test it in an inconspicuous spot first. , Use a non-abrasive sponge or towel to clean the laminate.If you are using your own solution, wet your sponge and spread it over the laminate. Allow it to sit and soak in a moment before scrubbing. If you are using a pre mixed solution, spray it over the laminate and give it a moment before scrubbing.


Use a soft used toothbrush to scrub along seams and metal edging. , Once you have washed the laminate, you should rinse the surface with water to remove any remaining residue of your cleaning solution. Warm water and a soft towel are great for this.
 Use a soft dry towel to dry the laminate if you desire. You could also let it air dry, but drying it yourself will help you see whether or not there are any remaining stains. Assuming that there aren't any stains left, you are done!

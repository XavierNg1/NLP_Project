 A solid metallic gold, silver, or bronze is an effective way to add shimmer and shine to your look. For a bolder option, check out a pump covered in glitter or sequins.
 Platforms and booties may make it easier for you to dance and move around in, especially if you are not used to narrow stick heels.
 High heels covered in straps have a festive, flirty ambiance and look great with many cocktail dresses.
 If comfort is your main concern, a flat adorned in sparkles or colored gems makes a wonderful alternative to a heel.

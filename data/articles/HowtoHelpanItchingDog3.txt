 Make a paste out of equal parts baking soda and water. Apply to the itchy areas of your dog's skin (i.e. the spots it scratches the most) and leave for 20 minutes. Gently rinse it off with the shower head on a gentle setting, a cup of water, or a wet cloth.Alternatively, add a cup of baking soda to your dog's bath to relieve the itch all over.
 To relieve your dog's itchy skin, gently wash it with an oatmeal shampoo. You can purchase a colloidal oatmeal shampoo at a pet store, or add ground oatmeal to its regular shampoo. For an intensive soak, add one and a half cups of ground oatmeal to a warm bath to soothe your dog's skin.Grind oatmeal in a food processor or coffee grinder, or buy ground oatmeal baby cereal at a grocery store.
 To quickly soothe itchy skin, make a mixture of half water, half apple cider vinegar. Pour the mixture into a spray bottle and spray the affected areas of your dog's coat. Make sure that your dog does not have any open wounds before you spray, as the vinegar will sting.

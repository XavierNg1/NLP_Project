 It is best to construct your frame before planting your crop, so that you can ensure a sturdy structure that gives the plants the space to grow. Decide how many plants you want to grow, as you will need one bamboo cane per plant.;

Use the canes to create a circular pattern about one metre/3.5 feet in diameter.






Push each cane at least 20cm/8" into the soil.






When you are happy with the shape of the structure, firm each of the canes into the ground.






Fix some twine to the tops of the cane, about 30cm/1 foot from the end.






Grab another cane and tie it to this one.






Continue until all of the canes are secured. Cut the twine and finish with a knot.
 To encourage the tendrils to wrap around the canes, you need to provide the plant with something on which to grip. Wrap twine around the canes about halfway up the structure to provide this.

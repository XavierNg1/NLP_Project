 If the flower clusters appear smaller this year, then it is probably time to prune., Lilacs bloom on old wood, so removing it too soon will take away your blooms., Cut them all the way to the ground, starting with your oldest canes., Your entire bush should stay near eye level. If it is overgrown, skip these steps and move on to a different pruning strategy, made for old and overgrown bushes., Prune them back to the strongest part of the shoot., This method will ensure your lilacs continue to flower as you try to get them back into shape. Use this three-year plan:

Cut one-third of the oldest lilac canes down to the ground the first year.
Cut half of the remaining old wood down to the ground in year two.
Cut the rest of the old wood down to the ground in year three., Lilacs are hardy, but you should not expect any blooms for two to three years as they recover., Cut them to the end of the flowering stem.

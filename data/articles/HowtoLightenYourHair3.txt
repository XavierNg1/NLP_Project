 To make a strong cup of chamomile tea, bring a kettle of water to a boil. Place a chamomile tea bag in a tea cup, and cover it with water. Allow the tea to steep for 10 to 15 minutes to ensure that it is strong.If you have very long or thick hair, you may need two or more cups of tea. Add an extra tea bag for every additional cup that you’re making.
 Once the tea has steeped long enough, remove the tea bags and discard them. Let the tea sit out on the counter until it reaches room temperature so you don't burn yourself when you apply it.Leaving the tea out for 20 to 30 minutes is usually enough to cool it completely.
 Spray or pour the mixture over your hair at the start of your shower. Allow it to sit on your hair as you do the rest of your bathing routine.You can leave the chamomile rinse on for up to an hour, so you may want to douse your hair before you even get in the shower.
You can also pour the cooled tea into a spray bottle, mist your hair, and sit out in the sun for a couple of hours if you prefer.You can use apple cider vinegar in a similar rinse. Just dilute the vinegar by combining ½ cup (118 ml) of it with 1 cup (237 ml) of water, and use it just as you would the chamomile tea rinse.
 At the end of your shower, wash the tea out of your hair with your usual shampoo. Moisturize your hair with a good conditioner, and allow it to dry naturally.

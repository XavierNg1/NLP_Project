 English ivy needs about 1 inch (2.5Â cm) of water every week after the initial planting. This can come from rain or from manual watering. After your ivy is firmly established, you can begin watering less regularly., You may choose to give your English ivy a small amount of fertilizer in the spring. You should not use more than 2 tbsp. (30 mL) per square foot (.09 square meters) of slow acting nitrogen fertilizer., You will want to groom your ivy now and then to maintain a clean and tidy appearance. Simply clip stray branches using garden pruners as necessary to keep the shape and appearance of the ivy that you desire., Every few years, you will need to do some more extensive trimming of your established ivy beds. This action will encourage new growth and help your English ivy stay healthy., If you notice your plant is less vibrant (drooping leaves or loss of color), take a close look for aphids or spider mites. (Although they are tiny, both types of insects are visible with the naked eye.) You can control (or even prevent) these insects by spraying the plant with mild soapy water.Combine a few squirts of a mild, chemical-free detergent with filtered water in a spray bottle.
Gently mist your plant with this soapy water once a day for three days to rid your plant of aphids and spider mites.
Then, to keep the insects away, spray you plant once every 1-2 weeks, or after a heavy rain.

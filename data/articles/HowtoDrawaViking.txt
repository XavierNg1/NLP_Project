 Draw two center lines in the circle.
, (Tip: Remember that vikings never shaved, pluck their beards or eyebrows so they are was huge and bushy)

, They have to be draw with no emotion or with anger (To make him look angry tilt the outside of the eyes up and the inside down, but don't make it too obvious)

, To make it look cool draw it thick but not long. Most vikings are strong and fat so they had thick noses. Draw a few wrinkles in(remember that in the end you are going to do all of the detailing and shadowing, this is all just planning)

,, Start with the eyes then the forehead, the nose and then the cheeks.
 This may take a little time but its worth it. Go with long strokes, some hard and others soft. Keep the shadows in mind.
 Draw a huge muscular upper body and a tiny lower half.;
, Use ovals and circles to make out a rough look of your drawing. Add in guidelines.
 Draw a shield, maybe a sword or an axe and don't forget that fur cape and viking helmet!

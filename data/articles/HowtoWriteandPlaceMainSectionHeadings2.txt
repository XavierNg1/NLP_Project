 Headings should start each section. They should go before you introduce the section. Usually, you do not start a new page for a new section.


Remember to follow the format for the required style guidelines given to you by your professor.
 Level one (main section) headings should be centered, bolded, and written in title case. Title case is where you capitalize the first and last word and other important words. You do not, however, capitalize articles, conjunctions, or prepositions. For example:


The Beet Goes On: How Beets Fuel the Body

, Level one headings should be centered, boldface or italic, and written in title case. For example:


The Beet Goes On: How Beets Fuel the Body
Or: The Beet Goes On: How Beets Fuel the Body


, Section headings should be numbered, followed by a period, a space, and the title of the section. For example:


1. The Beet Goes On: How Beets Fuel the Body

 Determine rodent type based on the rodent dropping you find. Mice droppings are a ¼ inch long with pointy ends, and rat droppings are ½-¾ inch with relatively rectangular or sausage like shapes.Squirrel droppings are roughly 3/8 inch with rounded edges, and can be recognized by the fact that they lighten in color over time., There are two common types of rats. Brown rats (Norway rats) are particularly common. Their bodies are 7-10 inches long, they have gray-brown fur, and a tail that is shorter than their body. Indoors, they live in basements and lower portions of buildings.Black rats (roof rats) are smaller, with 6-8 inch bodies, darker gray or black fur, and have tails that are longer than their bodies. Indoors, they lives in attics, voids in ceilings, and the upper portions of buildings., Peanut butter is a great option, as it appeals to all types of rodents. Certain types of bait will also work better during certain times of the year.


For brown rats, use hot dog, bacon, beef stick, or peanut butter.For black rats, use buts, peanut butter, dried fruit, or berries.For mice, use peanut butter, chocolate, oats, or nesting materials such as string.During the fall and winter seasons, female mice will actively gather materials to build nests. During these times, load some traps with string, cotton, and similar items.For squirrels, use peanut butter, nuts, grains, seeds, and tender fruits and vegetables., Aside from favoring certain types of bait, rats and mice have very different temperaments that lead to important behavioral differences. Rats are naturally cautious, while mice tend to be curious.Be aware of seasonal behaviors too. Trap squirrels in late spring and early winter in particular, as this can prevent breeding.

 Kitty litter does a great job for both cats and concrete because it's highly absorbent.;
, When it comes to kitty litter cleanup, you do not want the expensive, clumping kind. You want the inexpensive kind that happens to be super absorbent.
 Use a generous amount, and completely cover the oil stain.
 Wait for a bit, and give the litter a chance to work. If it's just a little bit, 10 to 15 minutes should be enough. For bigger spills, let it sit a couple hours, or even overnight.
 Using your grubby shoes, crush the litter on the oil, breaking it up and grinding it into the oily spot, like a scrub brush. When you're done scrunching, sweep up and discard the dirty litter.
 Using a concentrated detergent and a stiff brush, scrub the area in a circular motion. Be vigorous where the oil is, and then continue scrubbing beyond the spill, with a lighter touch. This will even out the difference between the scrubbed area and the rest of your driveway.
 After you've scrubbed, rinse away the detergent, and check to see how well the litter and detergent and your elbows have done their job.


If it looks good, clean up, and call it a day.
If it's still too stained, use more detergent and scrub more.

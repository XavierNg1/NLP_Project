 Place your image exactly where you want it. Once you drop your image, it may be a little difficult to move it to the precise place you want it. There are a few ways to more easily manipulate your image:

, Text wrapping changes the layout of your document, allowing the text to flow around the image no matter where it is placed.


Right-click on the image and hover over Wrap Text. Select the alignment that bests suits your document. You will see a preview as you hover over each option.
Select the image and then hold the Ctrl key. While holding the key, use the arrow keys to move the picture around the document.
 Click the “Insert” tab, and then click the "Chart" option. When you select Chart, a new toolbar will appear on your ribbon displaying a range of graphs to choose from. Choose your preferred type of graph, such as a pie.
 Scroll to that section of the window, and then select from the different types of graphs, such as “Exploded pie in 3-D.”


Click “OK” to have Word insert the graph onto your Word document and pop up the “Chart in Microsoft Word – Microsoft Excel” window.

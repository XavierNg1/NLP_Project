 In the Event Library, select an event you would like to use in your project.


Note: If you don't see the Event Library, click the Event Library button, normally located in the lower left corner of the iMovie window.
Click once on the event name to select the desired event. If you are creating a project with an iPhoto video captured on your iPhone or iPad, click on the iPhoto Videos, then select the desired video in the Event browser to the right of the Event Library.
 In the Event browser, select a range of frames, or the entire video clip.


To select an entire video clip, hold down the Shift key and click the clip once. It will be outlined in yellow.
To select a portion of a clip (called a frame range), click and hold your mouse button and drag across any clip range. Selected frames are outlined in yellow.
 You can drag it anywhere: to the beginning or end of the project, or between clips you’ve already added. A vertical green line, along with a green Add (+) symbol, appears anywhere you can place the clip.


The image below shows how the Project browser appears when you add your first video clip to a project.
Video that’s been added to a project is marked along the bottom with an orange stripe in the Event browser, so that you can see at a glance which video you’ve used. You can add the same video to multiple projects, and you can use it more than once within a project.
Continue adding video in this way until you have all the video you want in your project. Next, you can enhance your project by adding music, photos, titles (text that appears onscreen, over your video), and more.

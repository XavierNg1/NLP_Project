 Add a few drops of oil to the interior latch of the night latch. Then, add a drop of oil to the snip switch and to the base of the knob.








A few drops of oil should also be applied to the sliding bolt.
 Use a dry lubricant to lube the exterior of the night latch, which will avoid the accumulation of dust and grime in the locking mechanism. Puff a bit of graphite powder into the keyhole on the exterior of the night latch. Insert the key and turn it a few times, which will help distribute the graphite into the locking mechanism.
 Puff some graphite lubricant into the keyhole on the padlock. Insert a key and move it around to spread the graphite throughout the cylinder. Then, apply some oil to the shackle and shackle hole on the padlock.

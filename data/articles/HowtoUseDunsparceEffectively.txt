 Dunsparce is a Normal-type Pokémon; this means that it generally takes normal amount of damage from all types of Pokémon, except from Fighting-types where it receives twice the damage.


When Dunsparce gets attacked by a Ghost-type Pokémon, it receives no damage, but it can’t also deal any damage to Ghost-type Pokémon.
Generally, Dunsparce deals normal damage to all Pokémon types. In short, to effectively use Dunsparce in battles, avoid pitting it against Fighting and Ghost-types.;
, You can easily gain experience points (XP) once you learn how to effectively use Dunsparce’s type against opponents.


Facing Pokémon types that Dunsparce is stronger against will allow you to earn quick wins. At the same time, avoiding Fighting-type Pokémon will help you conserve its HP to lessen your trips to Pokémon Centers.
 If you don’t want to fight battles to gain XP, you can use items to increase Dunsparce’s level. Items like Rare Candies instantly increase a Pokémon’s level by one point.


Rare Candies are food items that can be bought from shops or from non-playable characters (NPC).
 As it levels up, Dunsparce will naturally learn new moves and skills, which can be quite cool and powerful.


Skills such as Ancient Power (automatically learn at level 19) and Take Down (learn at level 22) are pretty strong attacks that deal heavy damage to all types of Pokémon (except for Ghost-types, as mentioned).
Just be patient, and Dunsparce can become a great asset to your Pokémon party even though it doesn’t evolve into a more powerful Pokémon.

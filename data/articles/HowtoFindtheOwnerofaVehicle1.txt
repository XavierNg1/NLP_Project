 Particularly if you witnessed any kind of accident, illegal behavior, or if your car was the victim of a hit-and-run incident, you should not attempt to locate the other driver on your own. Your best option is to notify the police with whatever information you can provide. If possible, you should try to provide them with:


The make and model of the car.
The car’s Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). If you have an opportunity to get close enough to the car, you can find the VIN on most cars by looking through the windshield at the bottom corner of the dashboard on the driver’s side.
The license plate number.
Any particular distinguishing features, such as unusual accessories, paint job, or damage to the car.;
, Your insurance company has resources available that you may not. If you are filing a claim, or even just investigating the possibility of a future claim, the insurance company may be able to identify the owner of the other car.
 If you can provide the Registry of Motor Vehicles with the license plate or VIN for a car, they will be able to use that information to identify the owner. They will probably not be allowed to give that information to you directly, but depending on why you need the information, they may be able to provide the information to some other appropriate person (your insurance agent, for example).

 You are more likely to be happy if you spend lots of time with the people you care about the most. Don't isolate yourself.Social support is the most important key to happiness--more important than money, age, race, or gender.Eating a meal with people you care about can be particularly important. Invite an old friend over for dinner or call up a relative to set up a lunch date.Show your loved ones that you care. If you find yourself slipping away from important relationships, find ways to demonstrate that your friends and family are important to you.Do them a favor, bring them some food, or just call them up to see how they are doing. Gestures like these can strengthen bonds and will make it more likely that your loved ones will be a constant presence in your life.
 People are happiest when they are deeply engaged in activities in which they excel. This is called "flow." Think hard about what your major strengths are, and gravitate toward ways for you to exercise those strengths every day.Sometimes these key strengths are part of a career; sometimes they are a hobby you might do for fun. But no matter what, make time every day to do what you are good at.
 Acquiring a new object might make you happy for a moment, but creating lasting memories can bring you happiness for a lifetime. Make more time for experiences you really enjoy, and spend your resources pursuing new activities instead of new objects.Focusing too much on material objects will lead to "hedonic adaptation," which means you just get used to your new things and so need to keep buying more and more objects in order to feel the same rush. Resist that cycle by thinking about how you want to spend your time, not on how you want to spend your money., Don't expect happiness to just come to you. Schedule time for what brings you joy, and avoid activities that bring you down.Make sure you schedule time for exercise and leisure activities, your hobbies, and for your loved ones. Happiness is harder to attain when you are just cycling through work, television, and sleep.
 If your current job is making you feel stressed, rushed, or depressed, you might want to reconsider your career path.Ideally, your job should provide lots of "flow," where you can become absorbed in meaningful tasks at which you excel. If your job isn't providing this satisfaction, consider a career that will give you that "flow" feeling. Your days will fly by!


Remember that money is not equivalent to happiness. While it is important to have your basic needs met such as food, housing, and health care, having a lot of wealth is not enough to make you happy. Don't stay in a miserable career just because it pays well., The happiest people have a lot to do, but do not feel too stressed out about accomplishing their tasks. Find a happy balance in your schedule so that you are consistently productive but not overworked.This might mean that you schedule time in your day for meditation, a walk outdoors, or a coffee break to give you time to recharge. Don't try to do everything at once!

, Meaningful activities are those that help others and not just yourself. While meaningful activities might sometimes feel like a burden in the short term, they can also bring you great satisfaction in the long term. Volunteer for an organization you care about, donate your time and money to a good cause, or take the time to help out a friend in need.Even volunteering for just two hours each week can lead to greater happiness and a longer lifespan.

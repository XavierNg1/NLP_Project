 If the mushrooms are still caked with dirt or other debris, gently remove it by hand. Use a clean cloth, dry paper towel, or soft-bristled brush if you prefer. Don’t worry too much about getting every bit of dirt.There are kitchen brushes designed to help clean delicate foods, such as shiitake mushrooms. While these can be helpful, they are not necessary.
Often, a quick rub with a dry paper towel is sufficient.;
, It’s true that mushrooms will absorb a bit of moisture, so you don’t want to expose them to too much water. However, a quick rinse will not noticeably affect their composition. Simply run the faucet with cold water and hold your shiitakes in the stream for a few moments.Some chefs prefer not to rinse shiitakes. If you know your mushrooms are free of chemicals, consider foregoing the use of any water at all.
 Shake the mushrooms by hand or spin them in a salad spinner to remove residual water. If water remains caught on the underside of a particular mushroom, hold it by the stem and shake more vigorously.Rinse again if visible dirt remains.

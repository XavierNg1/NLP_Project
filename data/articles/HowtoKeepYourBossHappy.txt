 If your boss is fanatic when it comes to deadlines, then do your best to get everything in ahead of schedule.;
, From non-work related points of interest like pets, golf and ,jogging, to professional ideals. In general conversation, find an opportunity to make your boss aware of your similar interest.
 This way, when the two of you do disagree or if you need to challenge your boss' assumptions,  won't view it as "disagreeing" but rather, a "different outlook."

, For example, there are always projects and assignments that others don't have "time" to do. Find one that you can do and volunteer to do it! Your boss will appreciate it and remember it in the future.
, This puts you in a position to be honest with your boss without seeming confrontational.
, Realize that their success is your success.
 Every boss has that one project that they never have time for and it stresses them out. This is where you come in. Find out what project it is and complete on your spare time, such as a day off. Since your boss hadn’t completed it, it is probably a somewhat insignificant project so it won’t take much time for you to complete it and your boss will love you for doing that.

 Watch for some stink lines. This will take one or two "in game" days. Once the food has spoiled, click on it and choose the 'grab a plate' option. When your Sim eats the spoiled food, he or she will vomit or have diarrhea.


To check the status of the meal, roll your cursor over the meal; it will indicate whether the food is fresh or spoiled. Keep in mind that this may not work for older versions of the Sims.
 The best food to use is meat. The bacteria in it will make your Sims sick and they will throw up.
 Your Sim will not be healthy after eating too much junk food, and will eventually get sick. Examples include hamburgers, hot dogs, and fries.
 Use strange item combinations, such as mac & cheese, fish, and bacon. The smoothie will taste disgusting and your Sim will get sick after drinking it.
 If your Sim eats too much food, he or she will get sick and throw up.
 He or she will become nauseous and vomit. If you do not have a vegetarian Sim, you can create a new one, or wait until you get enough aspiration points; this will allow you to change the traits on your Sim without having to make a new one.


Vegetarian Sims also tend to get sick more often.
 Create a non-vampire Sim, then make him or her eat something with plasma in it. This will cause the Sim to get nauseous and throw up.

 Now that the decks are connected at either corner, bend the top deck downward. Bend slowly enough that the overlapping cards don't come undone. Keeping bending the top deck until you make the rough shape of an upside down "v" with your decks.From your perspective, however, the shape will simply look like a "v." Those watching you will see an upside down "v."

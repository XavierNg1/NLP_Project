 Soak in a bucket or sink of plain water for 15 minutes.
 If you use jam jars just push half the fabric into the jar and leave the rest hanging out., It helps to drip a different colour down each side of the jar. Then push more fabric in and drip more dye into the jar., Add more dye if there are still white areas. Leave for at least 15 minutes and preferably longer., You don’t want the fabric swimming in solution, just damped by it. Leave for 45 minutes. It will not harm if it is left for longer – in fact the longer it is left the more time the dye has to bond to the fabric., Fill the container with water, pull out the fabric and rinse very well. At this stage the dyes will still contaminate other fabrics so if you have a lovely yellow piece do not rinse with a dark blue piece or sections will go green. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. Then rinse again in hot water, again until the water runs clear. Finally, put through a hot wash or rinse in the washing machine. Hang out to dry and iron when slightly damp.

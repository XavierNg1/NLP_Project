 In order to type an inverted question mark through the Symbol option, you have to open a Word document. Once you have your document up, move your cursor to where you want to place the upside down question mark. Then simply click into the document.
 Look to the upper left side corner of your document screen. The sixth option from the left will be Insert. Click on it and a scroll down menu will pop up.
 Towards the lower half of the menu, you'll see Symbol with a small arrow right next to it. Hover your cursor over the list of options until you reach Symbol. You'll see two more options come up for Symbol: Symbol Browser and Advanced Symbol.
 A new, smaller scroll down symbol menu will appear. Move your cursor over to the new window, and scroll down until you find the inverted question mark.
 The symbol will appear wherever you positioned your cursor on your document.
 Once you have your symbol on the page, look to the upper left hand side of the Symbol window. You'll see three small circles. Hover over them with your cursor and you'll note that they have different colors. Select the red circle (the first one from the left), and click on it.


The Symbol window will disappear, but your inverted question mark will stay.
If you want to copy the symbol onto a webpage, or search bar:
Click and simultaneously move your cursor over the symbol until you see that it's highlighted.
Then, click on it with your ring and middle finger, and choose Copy.
Open your webpage or browser and click into it. Then, click with your ring and middle finger and select paste. Your symbol will now appear.

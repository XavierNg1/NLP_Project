 Try to take off a little time in order to show your relatives that they matter.It will help you be less stressed if you don't have to juggle work when they arrive, even if you do have to work during the visit.
 Welcoming people into your home or city can involve an array of things, but almost always including washing and/or eating. If they are staying at your home, ask them whether they would like to wash up or eat first, and then make that happen.
Discuss your plans for the visit after they’ve been fed and/or showered, and shown to their room or hotel.
 Putting a little thought and effort into making your annoying relatives’ sleeping area cozy and inviting for them will disarm them, in a good way.Sometimes you will be lucky enough to have a spare bedroom, but even at a hotel you can stop by and bring them some water and snacks, a bottle of wine and a wine opener, or some nice magazines that they would find interesting.
 Planning a few meals and few activities can help structure the time.


Don't feel compelled to produce elaborate dinners to impress your family, but if you like cooking and it makes you happy, do it.
Downtime is just as important, so don't forget to include that.
Plan meals or dining out alternatives that will fit everyone's checkbook.

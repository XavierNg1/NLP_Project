 Make sure there is some history left behind you before you go to the site. If there isn't much, go to some sites, like yahoo and just click on links to fill up the history.;
, The point of filling up history before is because the site you went to will get "blurred in" and "lost" with the other pages.


You should also get a few other windows opened up. This way, if someone comes by, you can just change windows.
 Be sure you don't take long though.
 You should do this just to be sure you don't get caught. This is also where having multiple windows open helps, as you can now fill up more history.
 You can now begin filling up history again.
 Once you are there, go back and forth and click on as many links as you can. Do this quickly however so it looks like you were only there for the whole time.

 Stick to the type of work that's their specialty.


Don't haggle over changes, give them a hard time or get too controlling. Part of supporting the arts is to encourage the artist to go on being an artist. You're not buying real arts in order to get the cheapest bargain or rip off the painter for a masterpiece by paying less than he did for the materials! If you do that, there's a good chance the artist will get disgusted, quit and do something else for a living, which reduces the appreciation of that masterpiece.

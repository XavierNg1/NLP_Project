 Littlepip lived most of her life in the underground Stable 2, in place of a Vault, and wears the recognizable suit. They are identical to the Vault suits from Fallout.;
, This, of course, being in place of a Pip-Boy. Pip-Boy models can be found online, or you can design a replica. Wear it on your right forearm as opposed to your left; Littlepip comments that unlike most Stable ponies, she wears her Pip-Buck on her right foreleg.
 Littlepip is described as having a short, brown mane and tail.
 Littlepip is a grey Unicorn, but creating an anthro costume is optional, and completely up to you.
 Littlepip's signature weapon, the Lil Mac revolver, may sound difficult to obtain, but you don't have to create or commission a custom job. It's as easy as slapping 3 apple stickers (in the style of Applejack's cutie mark) on the hilt of a toy revolver.

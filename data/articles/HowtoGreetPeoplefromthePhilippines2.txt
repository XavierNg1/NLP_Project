 In Filipino culture it is generally best to shake hands with someone that you are meeting for the first time. This is usually a soft hand shake, not an overly firm one.Greeting someone you just met with a kiss on the cheek or a hug is not usually done. This is most often reserved for once you have developed a relationship.If you are in a Muslim area of the Philippines, then the rules for touching, especially between men and women, may be different. Shaking hands may still be appropriate but men may need to initiate. Notice what others are doing around you and follow their lead., Filipino elders are often greeted by taking their right hand and bringing it up to touch your forehead. This is called "mano." This is especially important to do with ones own family members and with those that are extremely elderly.If an elderly person holds out their hand in front of their body with the palm facing down, this may be a sign that they are expecting a "mano" greeting.
This greeting is about you respecting your elders but it is also about the elder blessing you when they touch your forehead., As with many people all over the world, Filipinos don't necessarily want to talk about politics or serious topics with strangers. Instead, focus your conversations on the joys of life: family, food, and fun. This will make getting to know this new person more enjoyable.


In general, Filipinos love to laugh. They do it genuinely but they also laugh to move away from uncomfortable topics or to break tension. Be aware of this and be willing to change the subject if you notice this cue.

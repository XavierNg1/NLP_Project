 Immediately following the C section, you should avoid fully submerging the scar in water. This means you should not take a bath or go swimming. Ask your doctor how long you should wait before taking a shower., You can still take a shower and clean the scar by allowing mild soapy water to wash over the incision area. Do not scrub the area. This could cause irritation and may lead to tearing.Once the incision starts to heal, usually after a few weeks, you can resume your regular cleaning routine.
 Once you have finished taking a shower, you should gently pat dry the area around the scar. You do not want to rub it to aggressively because this may cause irritation.

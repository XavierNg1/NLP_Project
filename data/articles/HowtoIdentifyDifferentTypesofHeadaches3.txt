 If you are mid-cycle or about to begin menstruating and have a severe headache, you may be having a hormone headache.
 Dull aches on one side of the head that become worse as time goes on are often migraine headaches. This type of pain is often re-classified as hormone headache when accompanied by a woman's monthly hormonal level changes.
 Use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS) for fast relief. Hormone headache symptoms usually dissipate when menstruation begins.

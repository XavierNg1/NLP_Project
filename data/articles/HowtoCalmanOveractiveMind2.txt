 A mantra is just a simple phrase or word that you repeat over and over. You use it to clear your mind in meditation. For instance, one of the traditional phrases is "om," usually drawn out ("ommmmm"). However, you can use any phrase you want from "I love life" to "No more fear."To try it out, take a moment to close your eyes, and breathe deeply. Repeat your phrase over and over, focusing your thoughts only on your mantra. If your mind wanders, focus back on your mantra.
 One way to meditate is to simply focus on your breathing. Sit quietly with your eyes closed. Pay attention only to your breathing as you try to slow it down. If it helps, try counting to eight as you breathe in and to eight as you breathe out. Your mind will wander off, but just bring it back to your breathing., Another way to meditate, which you can do almost anywhere, is to focus your attention on what your body is feeling. Sit or stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Focus your attention on what your muscles are feeling.For instance, on a subway, you might feel the movement under your feet. Sitting a park, you might just feel the weight of your body on the bench, the breeze on your face, the solidness of the ground under your feet.By focusing on what your body is feeling, you're pulling yourself out of your mind and calming down., Walking meditation is similar to breathing meditation; that is you focus on your breathing to pull yourself out of your head. However, you also focus on the steps you are taking as well.Slow down your pace. When you're using walking meditation, you need to be aware of each step, and you can only do that if you slow down your walking.The great thing about walking meditation is that you can do it almost anytime, even going around the grocery store.

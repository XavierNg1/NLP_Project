 Open up the box and keep the flaps in a horizontal position. This will provide support when you add the air cushions. Cross layering is s quick and easy solution when you need to protect the product from all sides. This usually involves using two air cushions.
 Take the first air cushion and place it at a diagonal angle over the flaps.
 Place another air cushion layer in the opposite diagonal angle.
 Take the product and place in the middle of the layers. Push all three items down into the box.
 Use the ends of the air cushion to completely cover the item and close the box.

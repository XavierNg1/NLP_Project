 Ness is likely one of the first people you unlock, since he only requires that you beat the single player game once on normal.;
, You can win any one-player game on normal to get Ness. It doesn't matter what character you choose. However, you must only use three lives, and you cannot lose all three of them.


Though any character will work, quick and powerful characters like Pikachu, Kirby, and Fox are often the best against Ness. You will have to defeat Ness before he is unlocked., Continues are when you run out of lives and start a stage over again with three lives. You must beat the game with only your three original lives.


This includes beating Master Hand, the games last boss.
Playing defensively is often your best bet, especially on team levels (giant DK, Mario Bros, etc.). Use projectiles often so conserve life and do damage., Once you've beaten Master Hand, Ness will challenge you to a battle on Dream Land. Defeat Ness to unlock him.


Ness is small, with a very good grab and throw. However, he is slow on the ground and much better at fighting in the air. Stay low and use lots of A attacks to win quickly. Note that he can absorb ranged attacks (like Samus's cannon), so use them with caution.

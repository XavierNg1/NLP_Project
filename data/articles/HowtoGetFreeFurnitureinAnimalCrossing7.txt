 Every time your clock’s time ends with 4 (12:14, 8:34, 3:44, etc.), a balloon starts floating in the sky with a gift box tied to it., How to shoot down or get the balloon depends on the game (listed below). If you manage to get one, you’ll find yourself owning a random item, including furniture.

In Animal Crossing, you need to follow the balloon until it gets caught in a tree. Shaking the tree drops the gift box.
From Wild World to New Leaf, you’ll need a Slingshot, which can be bought from the town store for 500 Bells. You don’t need to aim, simply use the slingshot by pressing A in both games or tapping yourself on Wild World, and you’ll immediately shoot it down, dropping the present somewhere in the town.
In New Leaf, if you’re by the Beach Cliff area when the balloon starts floating by, head to the very top and start whacking with your Shovel, Axe, or Net, since it descends near your character at that area.
 Like with the present from a Letter, you’ll find the wrapped gift box in your inventory when you pick it up. Simply select it and choose “Open,” and then you can receive your free item!

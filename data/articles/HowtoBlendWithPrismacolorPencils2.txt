 You're going to be breaking down the lead of your Prismacolors to blend the colors together, so you'll first need all your color on the page. Start with your base and add strokes of other color. These accent colors will blend with the base once the solvent is added.Sometimes after drawing with Prismacolors you might notice a waxy buildup on the colored areas. If this makes your blending more difficult, you can wipe away the waxy film with a soft, dry cloth.
 In most cases, mineral spirits should be sufficient for your blending efforts, though there are specific brands intended for this purpose, like Gamblin Gamsol Odorless and Weber Terpinoid natural. Pour a small amount of this solvent in a small, resealable glass container.These kind of solvents can break down certain common plastics over time. Due to this effect, you should avoid using a plastic container for your solvent.
You won't need much solvent for blending. A little bit goes a long way, so a small container will likely serve your purposes best.
A resealable container is especially helpful when you are drawing often with Prismacolors. This way you can reuse your solvent easily.
 Using too much solvent can cause your colors to become runny. It may take some time and practice before you get the knack for adding the right amount of solvent. Generally, you should:


Dip an inexpensive synthetic brush into your solvent. Remove the brush, then blot excess solvent from it with a paper towel.
Brush your solvent lightly onto the area you are blending with your brush. Continue blending, little by little, until you achieve the desired effect., Eventually, the solvent will evaporate and your blended Prismacolor lead will return to its original consistency. Keep your artwork level to prevent colors from accidentally running.


Depending on how much solvent you needed to use while blending, your solvent blended art may be dry in less than an hour. In some cases, this may take up to a day to completely dry.

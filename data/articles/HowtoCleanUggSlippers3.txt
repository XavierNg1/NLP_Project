 The sensitive suede on your Ugg slippers should be protected. You can purchase a spray from UGG directly or you can use other protective sprays intended for use on suede or sheepskin items. Spray the solution on the slippers and let them dry completely – usually for one day – before wearing them again.Be sure to spray the slippers outdoors or in a well-ventilated area.
 Since Ugg slippers can be slightly difficult to clean at times, it’s important to take proper care when storing them when you aren’t wearing them. Try to keep your Ugg slippers in a clean place away from any dust or dirt accumulation – like in a closet or drawer.


Because of the suede material, you don’t want to keep them in a damp place that could ruin the fabric over time. Keep your Ugg slippers in a dry place instead of somewhere where moisture could reach them – like the bathroom or garage.
 Ugg slippers are mainly intended for indoor use around the house. Even though they have a hard sole, you should try to avoid wearing them outside – especially in areas that are particularly dirty.Try not to track your Ugg slippers through mud or other inclement weather that could damage or permanently stain your slippers.

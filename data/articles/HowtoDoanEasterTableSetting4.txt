 In the center of each plate, place a bunny or a chick figurine (ceramic, fondant, marzipan, whatever). Allow guests to keep their little find.






Arrange a white plate setting in place. Add a brown/natural napkin to sit flat. Place a small white bowl (for soup or salad) in the center of the napkin and fill with raffia or brown colored Easter grass. Add a real, natural hard boiled egg into the center of the grass. This looks especially effective for a natural or minimalist table setting (see above) and if you vary the natural egg colors between each place setting, it can look superb.






Arrange the plates in each place setting as needed. Add a small chocolate nest with chocolate Easter eggs in the center of the plate, on top of a square or rectangular napkin.






Simple felt cuttings in the shapes of bunnies, chicks and eggs can be strewn randomly across the table or formed into a line. Very effective, very easy to move around and something the kids can keep after.

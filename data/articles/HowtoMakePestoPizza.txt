 Buy or assemble the ingredients. Have them placed out and ready to use. Preheat your oven to the temperature provided on your package instructions or pizza dough recipe.;
, Place the pizza crust in the pizza pan or pizza stone. Spread the pesto sauce evenly across it. Don't forget to leave room for the crust at the end, as seen in the photo. You will need to leave some room for the crust at the outer edge of the pizza base.
 You can place them in any order you like but here is a suggestion: cheese, tomatoes, beef or meat (or substitute), basil/spices, and top it off with a little salt and/or pepper.
 Place the pizza in the oven to bake. Follow the heating instructions provided on the packaging or with the recipe you've used for the base. Usually the cheese will be slightly melted and the meat will be tender.


Since pesto isn't as thick as the usual pizza sauce, the pizza may take a shorter time to cook. It's best to keep a frequent watch over it while baking. It's better to pull it out as soon as possible before if over-bakes.
 Remove the pesto pizza from the oven. Slice and serve on a serving plate.

 If you start removing the wax before it has completely dried, you might smear the wax and make it more difficult to remove., Once the wax is dry, chill it using ice. Add a few ice cubes in a plastic sandwich bag and apply it to the surface of the wax. Chilling the wax will cause it to become brittle and easier to chip away.If the wax is on a pillow or removable fabric, consider putting the fabric in the freezer for better results.
 Using a butter knife, gently scrape the excess wax off of the fabric. Be careful to not use too much force as you could damage the fabric. You probably will not be able to remove all of the wax from the upholstery at this time.

 Since Parkinson’s often affects mobility and muscle deterioration, it can be helpful to begin working with a physical therapist early on. This will help you improve mobility, muscle tone, range of motion, balance, and gait.A physical therapist will be able to recommend a course of treatment that is tailored to your specific needs.
 This is a particularly viable option if you have advanced Parkinson's disease or have inconsistent results from drug treatment. Deep brain stimulation requires surgically implanting electrodes into the parts of your brain that control movement. A wire is placed under your skin from the electrodes to a device under the skin in your chest area. The device controls the amount of stimulation delivered by the electrodes.With the help of deep brain stimulation, many Parkinson’s patients are able to minimize their symptoms and decrease their medication.
 A major side effect of Parkinson’s disease is a decrease in verbal skills. If you notice that other people often have trouble understanding you, it might be time to enlist the help of a professional speech therapist. In addition to verbal problems, a speech-language pathologist will be able to help you with any difficulties you may be having with swallowing.A treatment that has been proven particularly effective for Parkinson’s is the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD).

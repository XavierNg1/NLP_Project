 Different areas of the world require different spray patterns to adequately camouflage something. For example, you would not want to paint a vehicle forest colors if you are on an expedition in the arctic.


Use blotches for deciduous forest and arctic applications.
A slash pattern may be used for deserts and grassy areas.
Broad blotches should be considered for jungle and coniferous forest areas.;
, Avoid light background colors in heavily treed areas where the leaves and branches create a dark backdrop. Avoid dark backgrounds in meadows or lakes where fall grasses and reeds may be the primary colors.
 Most camouflage paint colors are tan, black, green, rust, and brown. White and grays may also be used for arctic camouflage. Purchase 3 or 4 colors to give your camouflage adequate depth and texture. Make sure to purchase flat or matte paint, not glossy.
 If you're painting on metal, be sure all rust, dirt, and oil is removed. Sand and prime the area as needed.
 This may include the grip of a rifle or the truck's headlights.
, If the paint runs or produces splotchy areas, you are spraying too thickly. Move across the area of the project, and make even sweeps with the spray can. Allow the first coat to dry before applying another. Apply several light base coats instead of 1 thick one.
 Make the blotches uneven and fairly large. Allow to dry.
 Allow to dry.

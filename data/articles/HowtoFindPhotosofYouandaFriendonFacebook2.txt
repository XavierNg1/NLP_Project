 You can use the search function, or click on your friend’s name on your Friends List or News Feed., This button is on the right side of your screen under your friend's cover photo. Tapping on it will open a popup menu., This will take you to a new page showing you and your friend's mutual friends, posts on each other's walls, and photos together., This button is at the bottom of the Photos window. Tapping on it will bring up a list of all photos that you and your friends are tagged in together.

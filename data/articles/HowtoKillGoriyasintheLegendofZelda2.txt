 In this game, Goriyas can throw boomerangs that can arch above your hero’s head, besides the usual one that goes straight at you. It’s quite hard to predict whether the boomerang is going to go over your head or straight to your character, so trying to dodge it would only make killing the Goriya harder.
 As soon as you see a Goriya, quickly make your way toward it, disregarding the boomerang even if it damages you.
 Once you get close enough, press the Action button on your controller to quickly hack at the monster (you only have your sword). Keep slashing at the Goriya until it’s destroyed. If you attack swiftly, you could slay the monster even before its boomerang comes back.


It takes around two slashes to defeat a Goriya in this game.

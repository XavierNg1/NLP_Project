 To make halo hair extensions, you will need a pack of hair wefts (human or synthetic), a tube of bonding glue, a pair of scissors and some clear monofilament (fishing line).;
, Take the hair weft and measure it against the back of your head.


For these type of extensions you only want the hair covering the back of the head, you don't want it coming around the sides or behind your ears.
Once you've measured the correct width, use your scissors to cut them to size. Then cut two more identical wefts of hair to the same width.
 Take your bonding glue and squeeze a thick line under the rubber ridge (and directly onto the hair) on one of the hair wefts, then place the second hair weft on top. Do the same with the third piece, then leave the bonding glue to dry.
 Take a long piece of monofilament and measure it to find the right length.


To do this, place the monofilament across the top of your head (like a headband), then stretch the end pieces to the back of your head.
Wherever the ends of the monofilament stop is where the hair extensions will start. This is really a matter of personal preference, but most people want their extensions to start somewhere around the occipital bone (google it if you're not sure where that is).
Cut the monofilament to your preferred length, but leave an extra couple of inches on either side for tying knots.
 Take one end of the monofilament and tie it to one end of the hair weft using a couple of simple but tight knots. Do the same on the other end. Seal the knots in place with a dot of bonding glue, then wait for the bonding glue to dry.
 To apply the halo extensions, sit the ring of monofilament and hair on your head -- with the hair to the back and the monofilament across the top of your head.









Take your hairbrush and start brushing to bring your natural hair over the extensions and to cover the line of monofilament.
You can secure the extensions in place with a couple of bobby pins, but this usually isn't necessary.

 It should be a toothpaste-like consistency. If you'd like, you can also add a drop or two of dish detergent or peroxide. However, peroxide can stain your carpet, so be careful.


Make as much as you need to be able to apply a thin layer to the entire stain. Think of it like icing a cake; it doesn't need to be thick and gloopy, just thinly and evenly spread.
 As it dries, brush it in with a bristly brush (use an old toothbrush if you're in a tight spot). Make sure to get the edges as well as the inside -- sometimes the ring of the stain is the hardest to treat area.
 It's dried, done its business, hardened, and now it's ready to scrape up. Take a butter knife and get what solid bits you can -- hopefully the smell will go with it!

, What you can't get with your hands will need to be vacuumed up. If it all comes up well and good and the smell is gone, wahoo! But if not, wet the area with a damp cloth and vacuum again. That ought to do it!


Febreze the area to cover your bases. If the smell persists, wait until it's completely dry before you jump to any conclusions. Wet carpet can smell very bad, but the smell can (and probably will) disappear when dry.

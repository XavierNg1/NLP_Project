 Look at the body of your car. If it's blocky, bulky, or powerful, a more masculine name may lend itself better to the car. If it's sleek, sexy, and mysterious, a feminine name may suit it better. If the car doesn't fit any particular gender stereotypes, you can name it something neutral.For example, feminine car names would include Christine, Carolyn, or Shirley.
Male car names would include The Beast, Charles, and Wolverine.
Gender neutral names include Tequila Sunrise, Lightning, Alex, or Kelsey.
 Certain car models lend themselves to good car names depending on what they are. Determine the kind of car you drive and think of names that can include the model of the car.For instance, if you're driving a Camry, you can name your car Cammie or Cam.
If you're driving a Lexus, you can name your car Alexis or Lexie.
 Think about whether your car is a pickup truck, sports car, or regular sedan and pick a name that sounds like it applies to the type of car that you have. For instance, you wouldn't want to name a slow truck with the name Supercharged or Red Hot, because it doesn't represent the aesthetic of the car., There are a variety of more non-conventional names that you can choose based on the color of your car. Such names include Silver Surfer, Shadow, Black Magic, Marshmallow, and Ladybug. Determine the color of your car and think of names that can relate to the color.

Other names based on color include Nightcrawler, Cherry Bomb, Mr. Freeze, Cookie Monster, Frogger, Mean Green, and Creamsicle.

 Combine almond flour, coconut flour, arrowroot starch, xanthan gum, garlic powder, and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter a little at a time. Mix it until the mixture looks like crumbs. Add water 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) at a time until the mixture clumps together as dough. Form the dough into a flat disc and cover with plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.If you have a food processor, you can make the dough in it. Pulse the dry ingredients first. Add the butter and pulse until it crumbles. Then add the water as instructed.
 While you are waiting for the dough to chill, preheat the oven at 300 degrees. Take a large baking sheet and line it with parchment paper.
 Take the dough out of the refrigerator. Roll 1 tablespoon of the dough into a thick stick with your hands. Place a piece of parchment paper on your work surface. Roll the dough until it is less than a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick and 7 to 8 inches (17.8 to 20.3 cm) long. Take 2 or 3 teaspoons of cheese and press it all around the dough until it sticks. Place it on the baking sheet. Repeat for all of the dough and cheese.


If your straws break as you roll them out, piece them back together. Roll them again to smooth them out.
Recipe makes 24 straws.
 Place the baking sheet of straws into the oven. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. The straws should be firm and the cheese should be golden brown. Set them on a wire rack to cool. Let them cool completely before eating.


Cooling the straws allows them to crisp all the way.

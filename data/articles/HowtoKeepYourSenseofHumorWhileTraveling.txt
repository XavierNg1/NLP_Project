 When you are away from the comfort of your home, there is no telling what the world has in store for you. So while the best laid plans are perfect to make, don't be surprised, alarmed or disappointed if there is a detour in your path.;
, For as much as you would love to have your way 100 percent of the time, life doesn't work like that. On a vacation, you may be forced to accept your second or third choice as opposed to always getting your first choice when it comes to room selection, hotel you stay in, or time you have to schedule something. That's OK, though, just be grateful that you are away from the stresses of home and work, and enjoy the company you are with and new friends that you make along the way.
 If the maid forgets to bring clean towels, take the two minutes to call down to the front desk and politely ask them to send them up. It's not worth grumbling about something that should not have any impact on the overall enjoyment of your trip just for the sake of hearing yourself complain.
 It takes fewer muscles in your face to smile than it does to frown, so put those muscles to good use by brightening not only your day but that of those around you.
 If your gate attendant is slow and not moving as fast as you would like him to, or the server at the fancy restaurant you are at forgot something on your order, use a little humility and treat that person how you would want to be treated. You never know if someone is having a terrible day, and your simple act of kindness, patience or forgiveness can make the situation better or at least less volatile than it could be.
 If someone frustrates you, make light of the situation to save face for all parties involved and gracefully exit without incidence.
 While they may not be what you are used to, using humor and enjoying yourself while you acclimate yourself to these activities and the culture will help you ease into acceptance and enjoyment.

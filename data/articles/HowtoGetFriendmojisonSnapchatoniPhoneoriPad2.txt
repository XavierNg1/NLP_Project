 It’s the yellow icon with a white ghost, usually on your home screen.
 It’s at the bottom-left corner of the screen. This opens the Chats screen.
 Tap a contact’s name to open a chat with that person. Be sure to choose someone who has linked Bitmoji to Snapchat.


If you can’t find the person with whom you want to chat, tap the magnifying glass at the top of the screen to search for them.
 Tap the large white circle at the bottom-center area of the screen to take a photo, or hold it down to record video.


If you just want to send a Friendmoji to the chat (not add one to a photo) you can skip this step.
 If you’ve created a photo or video snap, it looks like a square sheet of paper with a folded-up corner. If you’re sending Friendmoji to the chat, it’s the smiley face icon.
 You’ll know you’re there when you see Bitmoji scenes that show both you and your friend.
 It will appear on the photo/video (or in the message box, if you’re just sending it to chat).


If you add the Friendmoji to a photo or video, you can change its size by pinching it in or out with your fingers.
 Your friend will now receive a Snap or message that contains your Friendmoji.

 Nutrition labels on beverages are often misleading. While the calorie and sugar content on, say, a bottle of apple juice may look low, check the serving size. It's possible the serving size is only a portion of the bottle. You may find there are two to three servings in a single bottle, doubling or tripling the calorie content.Make a habit of always looking for the serving size on a drink you're purchasing.
While you may buy a bottle of apple juice intending to only drink one serving, it can often be too tempting not to down the entire bottle. If you're not sure you can avoid the temptation, opt for a smaller bottle of juice.
 Read the ingredients list for hidden sugars. While a beverage may appear to be low sugar, it may be loaded with products that are essentially the same as sugars. Watch out for the following on nutrition labels:High-fructose corn syrup
Fructose
Fruit juice concentrate
Honey
Sugar
Syrup
Corn syrup
Sucrose
Dextrose
Evaporated cane juice

, Don't be afraid to ask about ingredients when ordering things like smoothies and juices when eating out. You want to make sure you stay healthy at all times.Ask about ingredients like milk at coffee shops. If possible, ask for fat-free or soy milk instead.
When ordering things like fruit smoothies, ask about added sugar. Request a smoothie be served without added sugar whenever possible.
Ask about the smallest sizes and whether it's possible to order a child's size.
 If you're going to drink alcohol, do not avoid eating first to minimize caloric intake. Not only can be it dangerous to drink on an empty stomach, as you'll become intoxicated faster, alcohol will lower your inhibitions. If you drink while very hungry, you may end up binging on unhealthy foods later on.

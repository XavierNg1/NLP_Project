 Companies like Dropbox, Google Drive and many others offer cloud storage for your most important files and can also act as an effective file transfer method between laptops. You'll need an account with one of these providers (initial membership and some storage space is typically free).The limitations to this method will be storage space, upload time, and potential cost - however if you need to move smaller files on a more frequently basis this may be a great solution for you.
 Depending on the service this may be as simple as dragging and dropping the files to your open internet browser, or could involve a more formal file upload procedure. Wait while the cloud service uploads your files in full.
 Download the files you want to this laptop and the transfer is complete!


Cloud services also provide extra security through consistent file backup and the possibility of collaborative file editing, so getting to know cloud storage may be a smart move for you regardless!

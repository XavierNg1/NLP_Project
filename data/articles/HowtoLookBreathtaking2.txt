 Remember, the right weight for you depends on your body (bones, height, etc), not on what you want. Look at a weight index; this will have the healthy weight range for your height. Decide if you should be on the low, middle or high end depending on your bone size. This might take a lot of time, but it is worth it. Find a healthy way to do this. You may want to try the following steps, or even better, follow a healthy diet.
 Set goals. Walk at least 2,000 steps or go biking. Even after you've reached your desired weight, keep up the good work to maintain a healthy weight.

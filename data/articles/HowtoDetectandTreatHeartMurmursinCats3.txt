Treatment will depend on the underlying cause. Options include transfusion, deworming medication, and corticosteroids., Hyperthyroidism can either cause an enlarged heart, leading to a murmur, or can result from heart disease. Treatment options include:Medications to manage the hormonal imbalance
Surgically removing the thyroid

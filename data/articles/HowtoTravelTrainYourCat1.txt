 Allow your cat to sniff it thoroughly, then place it on him. It should fit snugly, but not painfully tight. Let him wear it until he forgets that it's there. Do this daily for a week. Reward with treats and praise each time.;
, Supervise him while it's attachedâ€”he could get caught on something. Let him drag it around the house until he forgets about it. Do this daily for at least 2-3 days. Again, reward your cat with treats and praise each time.
 If he shows no reaction, tug it gently and call your cat. Do this a few times a day, for 5-10 minutes at a time, for a week. Reward with treats and praise each time.
 Continue the previous exercise, but outside, for a week; reward each time.
 Let him wander where he wants to. If he goes to the bathroom outside, praise him and give him treats.

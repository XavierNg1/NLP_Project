 Most modern laminate flooring does not require you to tap or pound it into place. Instead, they use a system of locks that "click" together. If you hammer planks together that use this system, you may break the edges, and your floors will not lock correctly., As the laminate is being installed, look at the laminate planks and edges to ensure they are the right pattern and don't have any visible defects. Replacing just one piece of installed laminate is difficult once surrounding pieces have been installed.Manufacturers will not cover defective pieces once they have been installed., While you want to prevent laminate flooring from expanding, there is no way to avoid it completely. To accommodate this unavoidable problem, it is important to leave a small amount of space around the edges of the room you are installing laminate flooring. If you do not leave expansion clearance, the floors may warp and buckle not that long after installation.Be sure to leave about 1/2" of space along the edges of the room. To be safe, check with a professional to figure out what the best amount of space to leave is for the room type and climate.
 Most quality laminate flooring is made with grooves and other designs that allow the pieces to lock together. This helps to prevent gaps. Pieces that do not get locked together properly will drift apart over time. The gaps will show as dark lines which are actually open expanses. You can correct these spaces with a rubber mallet. Tap the pieces back together as soon as you notice the problem.If gaps are left unattended, moisture or debris will fall into the spaces and make it hard to fit them snugly back together.
If you don't have a rubber mallet, find a tool that is durable enough to move the laminate but won't scratch or harm the laminate surface.

 Keep in mind that these flowers will be made of a single sheet each. You won't be able to make multicolored roses like you can with open flowers unless you use patterned paper. Start with whatever size tissue paper you can find. Typical craft tissue paper sizes are around 50 square centimeters.
 Crumple the paper into a ball. The wrinkled texture will give your rose volume. Be careful not to tear the paper., If your paper is a rectangle, cut it lengthwise. Each half can make its own flower. Take one half and fold it in half again lengthwise., Keep the folded edge on top. Take the bottom corner and begin rolling the paper like a cinnamon roll. Move the paper lower as you go so that the center of the rose is slightly higher than the gradually sloping outer layer., Finish rolling the paper by twisting the last edge tightly under the bottom of the flower. Wrap either a small piece of thin-gauge wire or a green pipe cleaner around the bottom tip to hold the blossom in place. You may also gently insert a wooden dowel through the bottom to both act as support and the base of the stem.

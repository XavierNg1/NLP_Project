 Most covers contain foam core inserts protected by a plastic lining. Remove the cover from the hot tub, and check its hinge area or underside for a hidden zipper to access the foam cores.If you notice a persistent moldy smell, you might have an issue with your interior foam cores.
If you have trouble finding a hidden zipper, check your product manual. You can also search online for your tub’s manufacturer and model number to download a digital copy.
 Unzip the vinyl cover to remove the foam cores, and take note of which of the cores’ sides face up. Check their protective plastic liners for holes or tears.If you find any tears or punctures in the plastic liners, use duct or packaging tape to repair them.Even if you don’t have to clean out a mold problem, you should inspect your foam cores every three to six months.
 While you shouldn’t use bleach to routinely clean the top of your vinyl cover, you might need to make a mild bleach solution to fight any mold growth on the cover’s interior. Use a ratio of one part bleach to ten parts warm water to create your solution.Use a soft bristled brush to gently scrub the interior of the vinyl cover and foam cores. Then use a garden hose to rinse them thoroughly.
Avoid using a bleach solution near grass, bushes, trees, or other vegetation. If you’re concerned about runoff, look for an eco-friendly mold and mildew cleaner at a nearby home improvement or department store.   

, After washing and rinsing the cover interior and foam inserts, towel dry them thoroughly. Leave all of the cover’s components out to air dry before reassembly.Don’t leave the foam cores in direct sunlight to dry, or they might melt.
 Reinsert the interior foam cores into the vinyl cover when everything is dry. When you replace the cores, flip them so that the side that used to face up now faces down.Like flipping a mattress, you should flip your foam cores twice a year to prevent sagging.

 Before you start, you should unplug the dryer to prevent accidents. The plug is usually located behind the machine. Test it to be sure that you have unplugged it correctly.
 Make a paste with baking soda and a few drops of water. Then, spray the inside of the drum with bleach water or a bleach cleaning product like Clorox. With a scrubbing sponge, put the paste onto the area you want to scrub and start scrubbing. When you're done, rinse with a wet rag. This should help remove some of the dye.


Make bleach water by mixing 1-2 cups of bleach with 1 gallon (3.8Â L) of water.
You'll want to wear kitchen gloves while you do this, as the bleach and baking soda can be very harsh on your skin.
 Now to remove the rest of the dye. Soak some old towels or a large number of rags in more of the bleach water that you mixed previously. Just get them thoroughly soaked, they should not need to be in the water for more than 5 minutes.
 Wring the towels out, to remove excess water.
 Run the towels through the fluff cycle on the dryer for about 30 minutes., This should have removed most if not all of the dye. However, if more remains, you can repeat the towel process a few times to see if any more can be removed.
 Once you've removed as much of the product as you can, mix a bucket with soapy water. Use this water and a clean cloth to wipe down the inside of the drum.
 With the dryer rinsed out, run a load of old towels through a cycle in the dryer to remove any ink which might still remain.

 This trick spins the stick on top of your thumb, ending it right back where it started. To do it, make a peace sign with your index and middle finger, then place your thumb on top to hold it in place.Your thumb should be in the middle of the stick so that it is evenly balanced.
 You actually have to push pretty hard. Remember, the goal is for the stick to spin on top of your thumb, like a coin spinning on a table. You'll need enough force to get it moving.
 The index finger is just going to get in the way if you don't slightly drop it. Keep it down to avoid stopping the stick from spinning, but don't overdo it. All you need to move is your finger.


Many beginners overcompensate here and move their whole hand, or really stick their finger out of the way. A half-inch down is usually enough.
 The stick should both rotate and move across your thumb -- away from your middle finger and towards the index.
 Your thumb should never move throughout the entire motion. As the stick completes its rotation, it will start to slip down towards your index finger. Bring the finger back up in position to pin the stick back under your thumb. You're done!

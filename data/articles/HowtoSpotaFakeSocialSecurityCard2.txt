 The number should have nine digits, separated by hyphens in the following format: xxx-xx-xxxx. The three groupings represent an area number, group number, and serial number, respectively.Before 2011, the first three numbers were tied to the card holder's geographic location, reflecting the zip code in the mailing address of the application. Since 2011, however, the SSA generates social security numbers randomly, in an effort to make the process more secure., The SSA follows a number of rules when assigning social security numbers, and therefore the number itself should be scrutinized to make sure it passes at least basic scrutiny.


The first three numbers cannot be 000, 666, or 900â€“999.If the social security number was issued prior to June 25, 2011, check this listto match the first three numbers (the area number) with the individual's corresponding state of issuance to make sure they match. Also note which area numbers in this list were not used prior to June 25, 2011.
Neither the area, group, or serial number should consist of all zeroesThe number itself should be printed on the card in a uniform manner, with all numbers the same height and width, identical spacing between the numbers, and no smudging or running of the ink used to print the numbers.

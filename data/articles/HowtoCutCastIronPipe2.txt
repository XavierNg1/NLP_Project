 Many of these blades are made with carbide grit or diamond grit for cutting through hard items.
 Mark the lines as straight as possible. Hold the pipe firmly in place. It may be easier to have another person hold it in place for you.
 Avoid applying undue pressure on the saw that can cause the blade to snap.

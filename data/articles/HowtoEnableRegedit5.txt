 We'll use this to make a Virtual Basic Script (.vbs) file, which will run a program to enable the registry editor.


This script was written by former Microsoft Valued Professional Doug Knox.
 Copy-paste the following into your text file:Option Explicit
Dim WSHShell, n, MyBox, p, t, mustboot, errnum, vers
Dim enab, disab, jobfunc, itemtype
Set WSHShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
p = "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\"
p = p & "DisableRegistryTools"
itemtype = "REG_DWORD"
mustboot = "Log off and back on, or restart your pc to" & vbCR & "effect the changes"
enab = "ENABLED"
disab = "DISABLED"
jobfunc = "Registry Editing Tools are now "
t = "Confirmation"
Err.Clear
On Error Resume Next
n = WSHShell.RegRead (p)
On Error Goto 0
errnum = Err.Number
if errnum <> 0 then
WSHShell.RegWrite p, 0, itemtype
End If
If n = 0 Then
n = 1
WSHShell.RegWrite p, n, itemtype
Mybox = MsgBox(jobfunc & disab & vbCR & mustboot, 4096, t)
ElseIf n = 1 then
n = 0
WSHShell.RegWrite p, n, itemtype
Mybox = MsgBox(jobfunc & enab & vbCR & mustboot, 4096, t)
End If

, Alternatively, saving it as "*.vbs" should work as well.
 Close Notepad and open the file you just saved to run the script. It should appear for a brief moment on screen, but you might not notice this.


This script will switch the registry editor's disabled/enabled setting. Do not run it a second time, or the registry editor will be disabled again.
 Enabling regedit with this script shouldn't require a restart, although using it to disable regedit will.

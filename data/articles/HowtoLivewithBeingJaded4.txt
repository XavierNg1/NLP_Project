 If you’re jaded about love or your job or living situation, sometimes being in a different environment can help. It helps distract you from your situation. Being jaded can often come from doing the same things over and over and having them turn out the same way. Overcome this by putting yourself into a new, one-time situation.Talk to someone you wouldn’t typically engage
Volunteer at a soup kitchen
Go to a sports event alone

, Again, dealing with being jaded in one part of your life doesn’t mean that you can’t be happy with other parts of your life. That includes discovering new things. Sign up for classes, join a group, become a member of a museum -- do activities you’ve never done before, even if you’re not sure you’re going to like them. Distracting yourself from the parts of your life that aren’t going well can help a lot.Join an exercise class or group for a sport or activity you haven’t mastered
Learn a new language by taking classes at the local community college
Get involved in a political campaign for a candidate or issue that inspires you

, Being outdoors, particularly in a beautiful setting, can help wake you up from the lethargy of being jaded. If you’re tired of the area around where you live, go elsewhere and be outside. Take a hike, eat a picnic in a park -- whatever helps you relax outdoors. Taking time to be in nature can be a good way to reconnect with the simple and important ways we are connected to the planet.

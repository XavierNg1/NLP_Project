 Say this at the beginning of a meal to express gratitude to your host or to the cook.


A more literal translation of this phrase would be "I will eat well." While "thanks" is not an official part of the phrase, the use of this phrase does express gratitude for the food you are about to eat.
Pronounce this phrase as jhal-moog-get-soom-nee-da. The beginning syllable sounds similar to a soft "ch" sound.
The Hangul for the phrase is 잘 먹겠습니다.
Use “jal mug gut sum ni da” at the end of a meal. The only difference is that the get (겠) syllable in the original phrase is changed to gut (었). As a result, the meaning becomes “I ate well” instead of “I will eat well.”

 The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is a federal agency that provides a wealth of research and information on substance abuse. You can access their website at: https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/locator/home.


SAMHSAâ€™s Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator is an easy-to-use tool to find a provider in your area.
You can either enter your location information on their confidential Web site or call a toll-free number (1-800-662-4357) to be given information on providers in your area.;
, Unfortunately, many veterans deal with substance abuse issues. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers many options for treating these conditions.


The VA Web site, http://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/res-vatreatmentprograms.asp, offers an easy way to search for hospitals and providers in your area.
Eligible veterans can access a range of services, including intensive outpatient treatment, residential care, and self-help groups., If you currently have a doctor you see on a regular basis, he/she will be able to direct you to appropriate providers in your area. Additionally, your physician will be able to provide any medical records that may be relevant to treating your addiction.


While at your appointment, tell your doctor something like, "I think my drinking has become a problem, and I'd your help to find treatment." Or, you could say, "I feel like I have become addicted to the painkillers prescribed for my neck pain. I need help."

, EAPs are voluntary programs offered by some employers that seek to confidentially help employees.


EAP resources can help match you with counselors or refer you to a treatment program in your area. Your workplace human resources department will know whether EAP services are available and how to access them.
Your access of EAP services and inquiries about them will be kept confidential by the HR department and the clinician.

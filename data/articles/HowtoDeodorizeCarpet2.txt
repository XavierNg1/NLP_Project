 Baking soda is a great tool to use for deodorizing any carpet, but itâ€™s especially good at removing smoke odors. Fill a measuring cup with baking soda and pour it into a colander while you walk on your carpet to provide an even dusting. Let the baking soda sit for 30 minutes to an hour and then vacuum it up., If you suspect that moisture is causing the odor issue, first dry out the carpet by placing a dehumidifier in the room and by setting up floor fans and angling them downward. Sprinkling cat litter on the carpet may also help in soaking up the moisture., After drying, mix two cups of warm water (473.18 ml) with one cup of vinegar (236.59 ml) and lightly spray the solution over the carpet to sanitize and improve the smell. Let the carpet air dry. Be careful not to saturate the carpet too much, or mold and mildew may be encouraged to return., Because of the moisture surrounding them, basement carpets can carry an especially dank odor. Cut an onion open, put it on a plate, and set it in the basement overnight to draw out that wet smell.Dispose of the onion in the morning and repeat this process each night until the musty smell subsides.

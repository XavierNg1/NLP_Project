“Abraham
Fierce unyielding brave tall
Son of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks Lincoln, husband of Mary Lincoln
Lover of freedom, tall hats, and good speeches
Who felt patriotism for his country and who felt grief at a divided nation
Who feared what would become of a divided country, feared the south would win, feared the costs of war
Who issued the Emancipation Proclamation and who won the Civil War
Who wanted to see the nation whole again
Born in Kentucky, died at Ford’s Theater in Washington, DC
Lincoln"

, Then try to incorporate these characteristics into the poem. For instance, instead of just saying “Lover of animals,” you could put, “Who loves her 3 orange tabbies to pieces.” In other words, be specific.
 Use words that best represent the person you are describing. Choose strong, vibrant words to describe them and what they love. Don’t use slang unless the person used that type of slang themselves.
 Use double spacing, as it will help each line stand out. Use present tense if the person is still alive, but past tense if the person has died.

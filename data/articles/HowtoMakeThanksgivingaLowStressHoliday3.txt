 If you know one of your relatives will go on a long rant about another's weight, choice of partner, or parenting decisions, speak to them ahead of time and ask them in a polite, but firm way to refrain from staging an "intervention" over a dinner you are working hard to prepare. If necessary, let them know that you will not go to all this trouble so that they can pick on someone they only see once a year.
 If you know for a fact that there is no talking to a certain guest, organize after-dinner entertainment that will split up your group for a little while so that everyone can take a deep breath. For example, offer a walk to a few of your guests who get along with each other, while suggesting watching family videos or playing games at your house to others.
 While many people expect everyone to "get along for once", chances are, it will not go smoothly. Don't plaster a frozen smile on your face and ignore family members who are actively ruining the experience for others. Take them aside (maybe in the kitchen, maybe while getting groceries out of the car or beverages from the porch) and ask them to change their behaviour. If they blame it on someone else, reassure them that you will talk to that person, as well.

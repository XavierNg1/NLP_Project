 Bring it to the line of glasses. Explain to your child how you will fill the first glass almost to the top, the next one a little lower, the following glass a little lower, and so on.

 Ask your child which colors will make purple? Depending on your childâ€™s age, allow the child to add drops of color to the glass to reveal the color.

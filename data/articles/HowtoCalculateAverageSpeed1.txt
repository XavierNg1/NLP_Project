 Use this method if you know:

the total distance covered by one person or vehicle; and

the total time it took that person or vehicle to cover the distance.

For example: If Ben traveled 150 miles in 3 hours, what was his average speed?
;
, The formula is S=dt{\displaystyle S={\frac {d}{t}}}, where S{\displaystyle S} equals the average speed, d{\displaystyle d} equals the total distance, and t{\displaystyle t} equals the total time., Remember to substitute for the variable d{\displaystyle d}.

For example, if Ben drives 150 total miles, your formula will look like this: S=150t{\displaystyle S={\frac {150}{t}}}.
 Remember to substitute for the variable t{\displaystyle t}.

For example, if Ben drives for 3 hours, your formula will look like this: S=1503{\displaystyle S={\frac {150}{3}}}.
 This will give you the average speed per unit of time, usually hour.

For example:S=1503{\displaystyle S={\frac {150}{3}}}S=50{\displaystyle S=50}So, if Ben traveled 150 miles in 3 hours, his average speed is 50 miles per hour.

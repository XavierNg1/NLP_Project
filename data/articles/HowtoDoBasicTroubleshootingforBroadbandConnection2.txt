 Look at the back of the router, and ensure that all cables are properly secured. Trace them back until you reach the wall socket. Check for any broken or faulty cables.
 If there are disconnected cables, secure and reconnect them. Observe the lights on the router to determine if connections are being made.
 Find out if doing the previous steps has resulted in a restored connection.
 If all the cables are properly connected, thereâ€™s no problem with your own wiring. The problem may be outside your own home or with the service provider.

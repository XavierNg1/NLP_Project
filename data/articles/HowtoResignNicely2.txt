 Practice having the conversation with yourself, in order to alleviate any fears that you may be having toward quitting. Change can be stressful, but have faith that you are working toward a better future opportunity.
 It is best to do this early on in the day, as the boss may have a lot on her or his plate. Tell your boss that you need to discuss a private matter, and ask when would be a convenient time for them to meet. Work around their schedule and respect that they may push the meeting to the following day., Tell your boss that would like to inform him or her of the reasons why you are leaving the position, whether it is a promotion in title elsewhere, an offer of more money or better conditions elsewhere, or poor treatment in your current role. Be as honest and forthright as possible.Keep the conversation friendly, but remain firm in your intention.
If asked for other reasons relating to interactions or working relationships, be cautious in what you say and discuss them if such reasons are significant to your experience at the workplace., If there is a big project that must be wrapped up before you leave, it is respectful to stay until it is completed. Your final day can be discussed and negotiated so that you can reach a compromise that works both for you and for your boss.Offer to help transition another person into your role, if time allows. Many companies promote from within, so feel free to recommend a fellow co-worker whom you feel would be suitable to fill your shoes. Giving them some training before you leave your position can help ease the transition for everyone.
 Thank them for the opportunities you have had with the company, and, if you would like, ask them whether you can use their name as a work reference in the future. Agree upon a date for your last day of work and shake their hand after the conversation.

 The devices pick up noise from throughout the room, which can make it difficult to understand what you are saying. Help them hear you by minimizing other classroom noises, such as fans, classroom technology, student conversations, and music., Some students who are hard of hearing will wear a hearing aid that allows them to hear most of what is said, though they may still mishear pronunciations. Be prepared to help them with their amplification device and have any necessary supplies, such as extra batteries.If the student hears well with their assistive device, then you should teach them as you would a hearing child., Many assistive listening devices transmit your voice directly to the student through a microphone you wear near your mouth. This can help them pick your voice out from the competing classroom sounds., If you are using an assistive listening device, then your student will likely not hear speech from anyone but you. Make sure that they know what you’re talking about by repeating the questions you’re asked before you answer them., If you are using technology in class, make sure that it is Hearing Aid Compatible (HAC) before using it, particularly if it is handheld or something the student must use with their device, such as a tablet or headphones. If it isn’t, then the technology could interfere with the hearing aid.

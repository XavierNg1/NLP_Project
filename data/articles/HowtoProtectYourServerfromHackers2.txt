 If you can, avoid divulging the physical location of your server. Hackers that cannot get through to your digital security will most likely resolve to direct physical access to your mainframe.
 If you can’t keep your server’s location confidential, especially for offices and business where the addresses are intentionally given out to people, make sure that only authorized personnel have access to the server room.


Lock your server in a closed, cool, and suitable room, and provide security keys only to those that need to have access.
 Hackers can easily break into your system servers just by knowing its IP addresses. Make sure that these kinds of digital information about your server remains confidential and on a need-to-know basis only.
 There are many IT professionals that specialize on network and Internet security. If you find that your technical knowledge is limited and if your budget permits, employ a security specialist to take care of protecting your server from hackers for you.

Salaries of these kinds of personnel range from a few thousands to even hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on the skill level. Though it may sound costly, it will prove to be worth it, especially if you’re housing very valuable information on your servers.

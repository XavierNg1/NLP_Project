 For this reversal spell you will need two small mirrors (on stands if possible), one black candle and one stick of sandalwood incense. Try to perform this ritual exactly at midnight.You can cast the sacred circle if you like, but it’s not required.
You will need to choose a place where the tools can remain, undisturbed, for one month.
 Allow the incense smoke to drift and build around your chosen ritual area. Carefully carve an X into the wax of the candle. Be sure to carve it into the side of the candle. Don't simply scratch the X lightly into the wax – carve it deeply.
 If you don’t have stands for them, propping the mirrors up against something will work fine, as long as they are facing each other. Put the carved candle between the mirrors. This set up will result in the candle appearing to reflect infinitely back and forth between the two mirrors., Relax and allow your eyes to shift focus back and forth between the two mirrors. As you look back and forth, concentrate on the negative energy of the curse. Picture it as something visible, such as a black cloud of smoke or mist.


Say the words, “The magic upon me, be trapped this night, between these mirrors, never to see light.”
You can improvise your own words for the incantation, if you wish.
 Picture the curse getting trapped in the reflected surface of the mirrors. Continue to repeat the words over and over, allowing the energy and power to build. Imagine the darkness of the curse being sent back to the original sender.Allow the candle to burn all the way down on its own.Leave the two mirrors facing each other for one month.
There is no guarantee that this works. Think of the ritual as a symbolic gesture. Positive thinking will help you feel better about your situation.

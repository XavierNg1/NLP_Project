 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). Grease and flour an 8 x 8 baking tray, or use parchment paper on the bottom as an alternative.;
, On a cutting board, slice the strawberries in thin slices and place them in a colander. Rinse well with water and shake colander to remove any excess water. Set aside.
 In a medium-sized bowl, whisk the sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix until well-combined.
 In a small bowl, use a whisk or fork to beat the egg. Slowly pour the beaten egg and vanilla extract into the dry ingredients mixture.
 Using a pastry cutter, add the butter in with the dry ingredients and blend until the mixture is crumbly and resembles a dough. Keep blending until the butter is in very tiny pieces. Place half of the crumbly dough on the baking tray and gently pat with a wooden spoon.
 In a separate medium bowl, mix the strawberries, sugar, and cornstarch using a wooden spoon. Stir until properly mixed and the strawberries are slightly white and resemble a pink color. Spread the mixture on the baking tray and gently spread it around with the wooden spoon. Add the rest of the crumbled dough over the strawberries.
 Place the baking tray in the oven and have it bake for about 45 minutes, until the edges and top are golden brown and slightly crispy.
 Have the bars cool for about five minutes and slice into squares. Serve on a serving plate.

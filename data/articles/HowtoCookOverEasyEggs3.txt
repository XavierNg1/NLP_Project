 Over easy eggs have a rich, almost creamy flavor on their own, but this doesn't mean they need to be eaten plain. Salt and pepper are extremely common condiments for eggs, complementing the natural egg-y flavor perfectly. Don't serve eggs without a pair of shakers at the table.









Some chefs like to season their eggs with salt and/or pepper in the pan. If you want to do this, sprinkle the seasonings on while the bottom sides of the eggs are cooking (before flipping them for the first time).
 Toast — white or wheat — goes great with eggs. Its crispness perfectly compliments the naturally soft texture of eggs. Best of all, when you're eating over easy eggs, you can use the toast to soak up the runny yolk. Alternatively, make an egg sandwich with your other favorite breakfast ingredients.









Substitute crisp fried hash browns for toast whenever desired.
 Eggs have a natural mild flavor, which makes them great candidates for spicy condiments. Hot sauces (e.g., Tabasco, etc.) drizzled over a serving of eggs can transform them from a run-of-the-mill dish into something with a little more pizzazz. Just be sure not to use too much.
 If you're willing to get a little adventurous, you can try seasoning your eggs with ingredients that you won't typically see at your neighborhood diner. The following herbs and spices each give their own unique taste to egg dishes. Try adding a small amount to your eggs at first — if you like the taste, feel free to add more!









Dill
Cayenne pepper (use a light dusting)
Basil
Sundried tomatoes
Sturgeon or whitefish
Caviar

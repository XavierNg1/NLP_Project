 Don't ignore him and make him become sick just because he can't tell you he is hungry. Make sure to look out for them.
 Do what you would with a speaking Furby with them.
 Furbys communicate through ultraviolet rays from the light sensor that are invisible to the human eye. Voice has nothing to do with it.
 Don't forget that mute Furby is a Furby too and that they need you to care for them just as any other Furby would.

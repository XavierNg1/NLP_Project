 Black isn't a miracle worker and if they style doesn't suit you in pink, orange, white, gray, purple, or red, it is certainly not going to improve with black. Be astute about the clothing you buy, in terms of cut, quality, and style, whatever the color.;
, As you're getting used to the notion of introducing more color back into your wardrobe, start brightening up the black with splashes of color.


Choose shoes that are a different color.
Wear a silk blouse or cotton shirt in another color.
Always prefer colored tights and socks.
Wear a sweater, jacket, or vest in another color.
 Choose brooches, scarves, bracelets, necklaces, and bags that not only are in a different color but that have something shiny or sparkling about them to draw attention away from too much black.
 These seasons are bright seasons and deserve more than black. You'll find lovely summery dresses in light colors, pretty cardigans in all sorts of colors, and delightful shoes and sandals in various colors. Now stick to not wearing much black during the warmer seasons. Then, gradually bring more color into your autumn and winter; after all, these are seasons during which you can do with a little brightening up.
 Black is easy, black fits in with the crowd, black is the work uniform even if work doesn't have a uniform. It tends to stupefy us, and we stop thinking "fashion" and start thinking "black only". Wake up to this bad habit and make conscious choices to choose color.

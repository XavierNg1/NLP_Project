 Once you know the type of area, get a map and make a sketch. This will help you to know more precisely where the birds will be.


What is the area like? Is it flat, hilly or rough terrain? Can you access it with ease or do you need to hike in and out?
Do birds use a cliff or other spot to take off over the ocean or land? Are there paths leading to this are that you can use?
Can you ask the locals for information? If there is a bird colony in the area or it's a feeding/nesting/take-off area, the locals will know a lot more than any static guidebook. Ask at the local store, recreation center or information center to begin with, and call any local birdwatching clubs too.
 Note both where and when you're likely to see particular birds (if you're looking for various birds, this may vary considerably).


Are there any hides? These are camouflaged hideaway shelters that permit birdwatching without disturbing the birds. They can be very useful for taking candid shots of birds that are happily unaware of your presence.
Plotting the places on a sketch map will come in handy for future photographic expeditions too. You can make notations on the map while on your first expedition to update or confirm data already input.
Slip the sketch map into a plastic cover to protect it from the elements and mud.

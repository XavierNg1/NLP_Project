 By default, Chrome does not allow any sites to use pop-ups for security reasons. Pop-ups can make your computer susceptible to virus infection, and some sites make them very difficult to close. You can change it to allow all sites to use pop-ups, but this is not recommended. Instead, if you need pop-ups for specific sites, they should be enabled one by one.
 Click the Manage exceptions.. button. In the "Hostname pattern" column, enter the website that you want to allow pop-ups from. Make sure that the drop-down menu next to the entry is set to "Allow". When you are done adding websites, click Done.Only enable pop-ups from sites that you trust.
 Reload the web page to let the new settings take effect. If the pop-ups will still not load, make sure that any extensions you may have installed are not blocking them as well. If they are, add the website you want to allow to that extension as well or disable the extension.

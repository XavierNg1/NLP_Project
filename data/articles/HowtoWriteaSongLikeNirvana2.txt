 Writing lyrics can be tough, but, if you've gotten this far, you're doing well.
 Kurt wasn't a "I'm going to start at point A, then go to point B, and end with point C," kind of writer, he was a "here's a bunch of pieces of songs that I'm going to throw together," kind of writer.
 Kurt's lyrics were also often filled with metaphors and confusing. Sometimes, he would write a song that was direct (i.e. "Polly," "Rape Me."), but only occasionally.

 Bubble wrap is a plastic packing material that creates a cushion with lots of tiny, air-filled “bubbles.” You can diffuse light with bubble wrap by cutting a two foot long strip of it and wrapping it around the flash on your camera. Attach it to the flash with Velcro, gaffer’s tape or a rubber band. After wrapping the bubble material around the flash, be sure to leave plenty of room over the top.


You can create an even softer lighting effect by using two layers of bubble wrap., White poster board, whiteboards, and even white walls/ceilings can be effectively used to bounce off soft light. To diffuse light by bouncing it, aim your light source at the semi-reflective white surface of your choice. The light reflects, or bounces, off that surface and creates a secondary source of light, which will illuminate your subject with diffused light.Make sure you target the light source away from the subject so that only the bounced light – not direct light – is being used.
 Professional silks are fabrics placed between the light source and subject to diffuse light. White bed sheets and clear shower curtain liners can be used quite effectively, but in a pinch you can get even more creative and still achieve some nice, soft light.


Experiment with a variety of different materials and objects to get a feel for the diffusion possibilities.
Try using things like bath towels, visqueen, paper towels, white t-shirts or dress shirts, printer paper and even opaque Tupperware.

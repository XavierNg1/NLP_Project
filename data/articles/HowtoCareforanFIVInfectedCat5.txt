 Check your cat for bite marks regularly. You should take your cat to the vet if you notice a bite mark and at the same time that it develops a fever. FIV causes a severe fever that will last for 3 to 7 days. When you take your cat to the vet he or she will check for:


Swollen lymph nodes. When cats become ill, their lymph nodes swell up. Your vet will check to see if this is occurring in your cat.White blood cell levels. FIV causes decreases in white blood cell counts. Your vet will take a blood sample to see if your cat has low white blood cell counts.
 Most cats recover from the first stage of the disease (the fever and low white blood cell counts). When they recover, they will stop exhibiting signs of illness but will still carry the disease. This period of ‘health’ can last for several months to several years.Doing all of the things will help lengthen your cat’s life and prolong this stage in which she is just a carrier of the disease.
 FIV causes immune deficiency that can lead to your cat developing other illnesses. You should monitor your cat for any signs of illness including:


Chronic respiratory infections caused by bacteria and viruses.
Gastrointestinal infections and diarrhea (Gastroenteritis).
Skin lesions (sores).
Mouth lesions (sores).
Neurological symptoms like psychomotor problems (like trouble moving around), psychological problems, dementia, and convulsions.
Weakness.
Emaciation.
Dull or poor coat.
Chronic urinary tract infections.

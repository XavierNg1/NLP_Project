 Fortunately, foundation doesn’t have to be expensive to be good. Look for a liquid foundation that’s relatively creamy, and if possible, one that contains silicone. Most importantly, you want to buy a foundation that matches your skin tone. Use a cosmetic sponge to apply your foundation, and make sure that you don’t put it on too thick, as that will just accentuate any wrinkles or bumps that you have.You can hold the bottle up to your neck to get a good idea of your face’s skin tone.
 Face primer contains light diffusers and are great for diffusing light, smoothing skin, and drawing attention to all the right places. Apply face primer to your shoulders, arms, legs, and even your back to achieve a smooth, brilliant look. Instead of buying an expensive primer, consider using a little baby powder instead.Primer is typically pretty expensive, but you can usually get it at a great discounted price. You can look through your Sunday paper for sales and coupons, often combining the two for an even better deal.
 Buy a brown-toned bronzer while avoiding orange or metallic bronzers, which give an unnatural look. With a wide make-up brush, apply bronzer to all areas of your face and collarbone that would naturally tan first: your forehead, your cheek and jaw bones, and your nose. Lightly dust your face and collarbone with bronzer to draw attention to specific parts of your face and shoulders, while smoothing out the appearance of the rest of your face.Choose a bronzer by what color you are when you tan naturally. Bronzers usually come in three shades: light, medium, and dark. So, if you are fair complected or just don’t tan much at all, you’ll want a light bronzer.
Bronzer is another typically expensive product. As with primer, look through your local advertisements for a sale on cosmetics.

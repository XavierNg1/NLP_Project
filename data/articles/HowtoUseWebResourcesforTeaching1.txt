 Become familiar with the various types of websites that are specifically designed to support classroom teachers and instruction. Do an online search for things such as lesson plans, exercises, quizzes, handouts, or posters to check out the variety of sites and support materials available. Bookmark and use the ones that seem most useful.


There are some teaching websites dedicated to specific subjects, like the National Science Teachers Association website for science or The National Writing Project for writing.Other websites, like Teachers First or Education World, offer hubs for teaching on all subjects and to any level. Use the site search functions to find appropriate resources for your field.Not all web resources for teachers are created equal. Be sure to evaluate the accurateness and appropriateness of the content as well as the credentials of the author or organization behind the site before you use it in your teaching.;
, The internet is overly rich in both resources and distractions, so it’s often best to gear your online searches towards a specific lesson plan. If you’re about to start To Kill a Mockingbird with your class, begin by searching for “To Kill a Mockingbird lesson plans.” If you’re gearing up for a unit on trigonometry, try a “teaching trigonometry” search.
 Once you have an idea of what you’d like to cover, try searching non-teaching-related websites for any additional materials that could contribute to your lesson. Public and education-oriented organizations like museums, libraries, universities, nonprofits, and government agencies will often have impressive online archives with photos, video, sound files, copies of original documents, maps, and such to support your teaching.


For example, if you’re covering the Harlem Renaissance, take advantage of The Smithsonian’s online exhibition of African American Art. Or, if you’re teaching about astronomy, use NASA’s archive of images from the Hubble Space Telescope.

 This can be a cup, bowl, or whatever you have handy.


Make sure you have enough space in the container to mix the sand easily, without spilling.
You can color as much or as little sand as you need.



If you add too much water, the sand will not be as brightly colored, or you will have to use more coloring.
You must use sand for this method. If you use salt, it will dissolve in the water.
 If the color is not dark enough, continue to add food coloring 1 drop at a time until you get the color you want.


If the color is too dark, add a little more water to dilute the color.
You may also mix the food coloring together to get different colors.
 Consider using a cheesecloth or other clean fabric over a sieve to do this.
 Lay out several layers of paper towels, rags, or old towels on a counter or on the floor.


Use caution that the color does not soak through and stain whatever is underneath.
Try putting a piece of plastic, such as a garbage bag, underneath for added protection.
The sand will dry more quickly if you put it in a warm, dry, well-ventilated place.
 Make sure it is completely dry before you store it, and that your container does not leak or spill.

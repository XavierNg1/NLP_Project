 If you don't have an account already, click the Sign In button in the top right corner of the Google Maps website. Follow the prompts to create a free Google account.
 Look for the "hamburger icon" in the top left of Google Maps. (This is a button with three horizontal lines). Click this to open the menu panel.
 Find and click "My Maps" in the second division of the menu. This takes you to a map-sharing tool.


For example, you can use this tool to share a map of local attractions to convention attendees, or road trip directions with your friends.
 Select "Create New Map" at the bottom of the My Maps page. This will create a new, blank Google Map.
 The map editing tools are arranged in a row below the search bar. To add a marker, click the pin-shaped icon, then click anywhere on the map. A small popup bubble lets you name and adjust the marker.


Experiment with other features as well, such as "Draw a line" for giving route instructions.
If you're making a complex map, use the Add Layer button in the left pane. Think of each layer as a category, such as "Restaurants" or "Parks." Click on the name of a layer to select it and start adding markers in that layer.
 Once you've added all the markers you like, click on "Untitled" in the left pane. Type in a descriptive name. Now you can find this map again by visiting https://google.com/mymaps and clicking Open a Map.


To share your map via email or social media, click the Share icon in the left pane, next to Add Layer.

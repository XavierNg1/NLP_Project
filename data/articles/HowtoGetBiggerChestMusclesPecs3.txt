 People often believe that to get big muscles, you need to eat a lot of calories. You do need to be eating enough calories to give you energy through training, but not so many that your body has to work on burning fat instead of building muscle. Being lean helps the muscles you're working so hard to build look more visible.


Stay away from empty carbohydrates like pasta, white bread, cakes, cookies, and other baked goods. Choose whole grains.
Don't eat too many foods that are processed or fried, and limit fast food and snacks.
 Protein is a building block for muscle, and you're going to need a lot of it if you want a big chest. You can get your protein from a multitude of sources - not just meat. Consider these options:


Lean meats like chicken, fish, lean beef, and pork.
Eggs and low-fat dairy.
Nuts and beans.
Kale, spinach, and other vegetables that have protein.
Tofu and soy

, Many people who are working on building muscles take creatine, a powdered amino acid that is mixed with water and ingested three or more times daily. It is considered safe to consume by the FDA, since it's composed of the same protein that our bodies produce naturally to build muscle.


You may also consider taking a protein shake supplement it is one of the most beneficial supplements to gaining muscle and leading an overall healthy life.

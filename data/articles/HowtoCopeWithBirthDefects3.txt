 Certain conditions require very little additional expense to take proper care of your child, while others may require expensive medical equipment, extended hospitalization or repeated surgeries, or regular medication.


Ask a physician and do research about the likely items or services your child will need to be safe and healthy and to have the best chance at a happy life, such as prosthetic limbs, a wheelchair, a heart stint, GI repair surgery, or special education. He or she can direct you toward government programs that cover the cost of considerable expenses or programs that provide free or low-cost assistance for emotional, physical, and behavioral development.
 Some infants require space for medical equipment in the nursery or may require special ramps or bathroom equipment once they are more mobile.


Begin saving for the cost of significant physical alterations to the house, alter clothing for tube or equipment access if necessary, and inquire about financial assistance for special transport or living equipment if your baby will require it.
 In some cases, financial assistance from the government may allow a parent to stay home to care for a child with a birth defect. In other cases, specialty childcare may need to be arranged so that your child will be appropriately cared for when you return to work.

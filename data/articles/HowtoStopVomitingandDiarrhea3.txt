 Young children are at higher risk for dehydration. Make sure your child is as hydrated as possible while you wait to see the doctor. Since your child may not want to drink water, offer a variety of things, including:Ice chips (if not an infant)
Popsicles (if not an infant)
White grape juice
Frozen juice slushy
Breastmilk (if nursing)

, If your child is older than one year, you can feed her clear chicken or vegetable broths (beef broths can be given, but they often upset a nauseous stomach). You can also give juice mixed with an equal amount of water.


Avoid giving something that's too sugary, like soda or pure juice since these tend to make diarrhea worse., If the diarrhea and vomiting in infants and children lasts longer than a few hours, call your physician. The doctor might recommend an ORS, such as Pedialyte, which contains fluids and electrolytes (minerals) that are needed to prevent dehydration. You can find these at most grocery and drugstores.


For infants and small children, start with about 1 teaspoon of ORS every minute or two. If they can keep the ORS down without vomiting, slowly increase the amount of ORS.You can administer it using a spoon, medicine dropper or cup. With infants, you can wet a cotton washcloth and squeeze drops into their mouths if they wonâ€™t take the breast or bottle.
For bottle fed infants, use a lactose free infant formula because the sugar, lactose, can make diarrhea worse.
You can also find Pedialyte popsicles for kids that refuse to drink.

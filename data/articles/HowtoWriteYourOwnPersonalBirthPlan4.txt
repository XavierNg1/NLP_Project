 You are telling the staff exactly what you want, not asking if it is OK. Start your sentences with “I would like” rather than phrase it as “I would prefer”

, Keep in mind that what you deem to be minimal treatment may not necessarily be what your provider considers minimal treatment. Phrases such as “kept at a minimal” are not specific enough. Instead use phrases such as “every 20 minutes if all is well”.
 This is your plan and it should clearly communicate your personal desires. Write your plan keeping in mind that you are expecting your desires to be carried out. Make sure that you understand exactly what you are requesting.
 Do you already know that you want to rely on pain medication or do you prefer to take a wait-and-see approach?

, Do you want to place a limit on the number of vaginal exams you would like to receive? Are you okay with constant fetal monitoring or would you prefer only intermittent monitoring?

, Think everything through and come up with a plan that includes all of your basic desires.



Include your preferences for how to handle a difficult delivery. Do you wish to have an epistolary if necessary? If so, do you a want local anesthetic applied?
Include your choices for simple requests. Do you wish to be able to position yourself for productive pushing?
Include your desire for dad to cut the cord and whether or not you would like to save the cord blood. Try to be as thorough as possible without being overbearing.
 Do you want skin to skin contact immediately after baby is born? Do you want the baby placed on your chest? Would you like to be able to breastfeed immediately?

, List the type of incision that you prefer and the type of sutures that you would like to be used. Add your desire for a Douala in the room if you have one. Keep in mind that if an emergency arises, the hospital staff will do their best to follow your birth plan and meet your specific requests, although sometimes they may have to deviate from the plan for safety reasons.
 Do you want to have your baby remain in the room with you around the clock? Do you want your baby to be given any bottles or will he be strictly breastfed only? Do you want a pacifier given to your baby?

, This verifies that they are clearly aware of and understand your specific desires.
 A well-designed birth plan is useless if you forget to bring it to the hospital with you. Take precautions to ensure that you remember to bring your birth plan with you to the hospital.


It would be wise to make a few copies of your plan. Keep one in your car, one in your purse and one in your overnight bag. Sometimes, things do not go as planned. Having your birth plan readily available in the case of unexpected circumstances will be appreciated if things drift from the norm.
Keep in mind that emergencies arise and situations occur that may require different health options and care than you requested.

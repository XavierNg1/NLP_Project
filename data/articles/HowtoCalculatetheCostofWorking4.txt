 If you are offered two jobs, calculate the advantage or disadvantage of accepting a job that has a shorter commute. A shorter commute can help save on fuel costs, which is important to consider when comparing the pros and cons of multiple jobs.


Imagine that you have a car that has a 15-gallon tank and gets 20 miles per gallon. If gas is $2.00 per gallon, it will cost you $30 to fill up your tank.
You have been offered Job A, which has annual salary of $50,000 and requires that you drive at least 400 miles each week. To commute to this job, you will need to fill up your tank 1.3 times each month. At this rate, you will be spending $468 in fuel each year. Without factoring in other expenses, this will leave you with a salary of $49,532 annually.
Imagine that you have been offered Job B, which pays an annual salary of $52,000, but the commute requires that you drive 60 miles each day. In the same car, you will be driving 300 miles each week, or 1,200 miles each month, which will require that you fill up your tank once a week. At this rate, you will be paying $1,560 in fuel each year. Without factoring in other expenses, this will leave you with a salary of $50,440 annually.
Although there is a $2,000 pay difference between Job A and Job B, there will only be a difference of about $900 when you factor in the distance and cost of fuel.
 If you have a child or a pet, look into your employer's benefits regarding daycare or pet care. If Job A pays less than Job B but has daycare on-site or allows you to bring your dog to the office, then it may be more economical to accept Job A even if it pays less.


Doggie daycare can cost between $12 to $38 each day, depending on your location.To send your dog to daycare 5 days per week, you could be spending $3,120 to $9,880 every year. Imagine that doggie daycare is $8,000 annually in your area.
If Job A pays $52,000 annually but does not allow you to bring your dog to the office, you will be left with a salary of $44,000 annually without factoring in other expenses. If Job B pays $50,000 each year and allows you to bring your dog to work, you can save a significant amount of money.
The average cost of childcare in the U.S. is $11,666 per year.If childcare is offered in your workplace as an employee benefit, you could save around $12,000 annually. Imagine that Job A pays $60,000 annually but does not offer this benefit, but Job B, which pays $52,000, does. In this case, the cost of working at Job B would be more economical than accepting Job A, even if it does have a lower salary.
 Accepting a job that has a casual dress code can help reduce the cost of working, particularly if you do not need to buy new clothes and accessories. When comparing two positions, consider if you will need to buy new clothes and accessories, and how much this may cost you each year.


Imagine that Job A and Job B have the same commute and similar salaries. Job A will require that you spend $400 in business casual attire annually, while Job B will require that you spend $120 annually for casual attire. Over a five-year period, you could save $1,400 in work clothing if you accept Job B.

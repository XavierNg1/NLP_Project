 If the court approves the name change on the papers, or if the name change is approved after a hearing, the court will mail the signed order to you in the envelope you provided. This will likely take several weeks, and possibly two months or more. The name change is official when you receive the signed order.
 The court's order will show both the old and new names and the applicant's current address. This information will become public record unless the judge waives publication to ensure the applicant's safety. If you are concerned about safety, note this on the application and/or at the hearing.
 This includes the Social Security Administration, the Department of Motor Vehicles, and other applicable government agencies. The court's order will not automatically change your name with any other government agency. You must complete the necessary paperwork yourself.

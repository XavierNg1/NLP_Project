 Most modern elegant styles are minimal and classic. Instead of worrying about how you will bring style into all aspects of your wedding, you may want to reduce the number of details.
 There are dozens of blogs and Pinterest boards with ideas on how to handle many of the wedding details beautifully and inexpensively. Consider everything from hair and makeup to cake and flowers.
 Plan ahead to save yourself the cost and effort of importing flowers from another location. If possible, ask a friend or family to arrange the centerpieces or tie together some flowers for simple bouquets.
 Vintage tea cups or glasses can be used on tables or to hold candles and flowers. If you can't find what you're looking for, shop at Target or CB2 for inexpensive vases and decorations.
 Instead, put that money into another part of the wedding that will improve the experience for your guests.
 Tulle is relatively inexpensive at most fabric stores and it comes in many colors. Attach ribbon or twist it for a tasteful ceremony or reception decoration.

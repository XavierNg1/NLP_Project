 This workout only uses one dumbbell. You can do this while standing or sitting.









Grasp one dumbbell with both of your hands and hold it behind your head. Your arms should be bent into right angles with your forearms running along the sides of your head so that the dumbbell is behind your head.
Extend your elbows and lift your forearms so that they are pointed vertically above your head with the dumbbell. Hold that position for a moment and then lower them back to the right angle position behind your head.
 Stand with your back straight, and hinge forward from the hip. Start with arms hanging down, with your elbows to your ribs. This is the start position. Lift from the forearm only, so that the arm straightens parallel with the torso. The palm should turn up as it approaches the hip. As the elbow bends, lower the forearm. Repeat for the desired number of sets and repetitions.
 Lie down on your back either on the ground or on your bed. If you have a workout bench at home, lie down on that.









Hold a dumbbell in each hand so that your palms are facing up. The outside of your forearms and elbows should be facing up towards the ceiling so that your arms create two upside-down ‘V’s. This is the resting position.
Raise the dumbbells up to the ceiling by extending your elbows. Hold the dumbbells in the air for a short pause and then lower them back down to the resting position.

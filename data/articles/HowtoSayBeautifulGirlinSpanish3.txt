Remember that Spanish is spoken in many different countries. Each country has different slang words, and uses the language a little differently. Find out the local lingo for "girl."

, This is also useful if you don’t know the age of the girl being spoken about."Bella” is a common colloquial way of saying “beautiful.”
You can also use, “linda” or “bonita.”

, In Spanish, the adjective generally comes after the noun. In English, we say, “the beautiful girl.” However, in Spanish, you would say, “la chica bella.” In this case, “la chica” is the noun (the girl). “Bella” is the adjective (beautiful).You can experiment with building sentences, such as “You are a beautiful girl,” or, “Eres una chica bonita.”

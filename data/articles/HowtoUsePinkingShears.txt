 See How to choose pinking shears for more information.
 Not all fabrics will respond well to pinking shears. The best fabric is that which is woven tightly.
 If a single layer is not enough to get a good grip, two and maybe up to four layers might work better. One important caveat is to ensure you don't make the layers too thick, so that the fabric mangles or warps. Pinking shears are made for one layer, so adding more needs to be by trial and error. Four layers is probably the maximum, although this will depend on the fabric.


For more delicate fabric, it might cut if there is a solid backing behind the fabric. You will need to cut this backing fabric as well, so be sure it's just scrap material.
Take care with fabric that isn't plain or straight lined. Pattern fabrics can be very hard to achieve a professional appearance with pinking, at least for garments. However, if it's just a jam jar lid cover, there's no need to worry!

, The edge should always be created as the last embellishment.
 Your grip should be firm but comfortable. If you purchased ambidextrous pinking shears, either hand will be fine depending on your own coordination with each hand. Otherwise, be sure to hold the pinking shears in the correct hand.
 They cannot cut if held at an angle. (Try it and you'll see what happens; either it won't cut or it will mangle and chew up the fabric.) You'll soon get a feel for it.
 Start from the second rear tooth and simply bring down the blades until they are completely closed. Do not try to move along as with normal scissors or the teeth will catch and rip the fabric. After you have made the first cut, open the pinking shears and align the teeth with the last notch cut on the fabric and press down again. Continue until the length is cut.
 Use a backstitch for the beginning and end of the pieces and a running stitch or something for the middle.;

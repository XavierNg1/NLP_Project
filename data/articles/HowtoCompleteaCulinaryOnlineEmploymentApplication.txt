Be specific. "Kitchen job" can mean anything from executive chef to a plate setter. Chances are if the description of the job you desire is too broad, your application may be passed over. Leave no room for doubt about what position - whether it be in the kitchen, dining room or restaurant office - you are seeking.;
, Don't waste yours or a potential employer's time by filling out an application for a restaurant job you have no intention of taking should it be offered to you.


When thinking about job location, you should also have a clear idea of how far you are willing to drive to work if you are offered a food service job.
 Those seeking jobs as chefs or cooks are not usually required to have a high school diploma, but if you plan to make a career in the culinary arts it is a plus - many cooks and chefs attend vocational schools or two- to four-year colleges to study. Also consider classes in business or occupational math of business administration. If you have had any on-the-job training in any culinary arts area, include that on your application.


Before you begin filling out online culinary applications, make a comprehensive list of any relevant schooling, coursework and training you have completed. Include the proper names of all schools and facilities at which you studied, and include dates for any educational courses and work experience. Don't forget workshops or vocational courses you have taken that are food-service related.
 If the application asks for you to indicate a desired salary, be honest, but realistic.



Check out hotels, motels and banquet facilities. These places are often looking for dependable, experienced kitchen and dining room help, and many offer online applications. Find out if there are food service internships available in the area where you are searching for jobs. A successful internship enhances a resume.

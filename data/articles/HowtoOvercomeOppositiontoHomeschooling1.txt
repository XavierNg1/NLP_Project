 This manner of testing produces an education system in which the goal is often to get the kids to pass the test, rather than learn important skills and abilities.For instance, in U.S. high schools:


reading skills are ranked lower than those in 19 other nations
math skills are ranked lower than those in 29 other nationsscience skills are ranked lower than those in 26 other nationsIf someone is opposed to homeschooling, share with them the results of the 2009 study that demonstrated that homeschooled children are more successful than children educated in public schools.;
, If your child is very bright, teachers might struggle to provide them with a truly engaging education.Homeschooling your gifted child is a good choice to ensure that they are being challenged and taught at an appropriate level. At the other end of the scale, if your child does not learn quickly or has a learning disorder, you might also choose homeschooling in order to provide them with the extra attention and assistance they need.


The average number of kids in a public school class is about 23. Some classes have over 30 students. In a homeschooled environment, however, parents or tutors get to work with just one (or a small handful) of students.
 But because homeschooling is not structured in the same way regular classes are, the need for a regular teacher to lead lessons and explain instructions is less important. Most homeschooled students learn on their own using interactive self-guided lessons online or with DVDs and movies.


In a homeschooled environment, any day could be a field trip day. Explain to homeschooling skeptics that children can learn a great deal when visiting the zoo or history museum.
There are tons of homeschool teaching resources out there. Many companies produce educational materials â€“ books, films, audio recordings -- across a range of subjects and grade levels. These resources make homeschooling easy.

 There are always photographers looking to do free or near free headshots to test out new equipment or to build their portfolio. In the search box, just type in "free headshots" and you'll be taken to all of the listings. These usually go quickly though, so you'll want to be sure you are one of the first ones there.;
, You never know if they have a photographer friend who would be willing to do your headshots for free or a very reduced price. It's a great way to meet new people and start networking.
 Some have a pay as you go type of system, where you do the session for free and then buy the pictures you like. And if you don't like any, you don't pay anything. Other photographers offer a free headshot giveaway every week when you register to their newsletter.
 Ask a friend to help you though, because you can't snap the shutter while posing for it without it looking like the classic Myspace picture. Ideally though, you want to use a DSLR camera. If you know anyone who has one, ask them if they'd be willing to either lend it to you or take some pictures of you for fun. Go to a headshot website online and try to mimic the exact look of some professional ones. Surprisingly, it can work!

, If you don't find a good headshot photographer from these tips, just keep looking, and scouring Craigslist. You'll find something eventually.

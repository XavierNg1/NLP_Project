 By making a large batch of shredded chicken at once, you will save time and effort breaking out and setting up your mixer every time you want a meal with shredded chicken.


Remove the chicken in the amount you plan on using and let it thaw for a few hours before using.
 Dice a large onion into large chunks. Sprinkle four pounds of chicken with one tablespoon of garlic herbal seasoning, or to taste. Place the onion in the bottom of your slow cooker crock and put the chicken on top. Set the cooker to high for two to three hours, or to low for four to five hours. When the time is up, remove the chicken and serve your tender, flavorful shredded chicken with a side of steamed broccoli and rice.


This recipe makes eight cups of shredded chicken.



Transfer the sauce to a medium skillet and add eight ounces of shredded chicken. Heat on medium for three to four minutes, then reduce heat to the lowest setting. Cover for 50-55 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Toast some bread or sesame seed buns on a cast iron skillet. Slather the buns with mayonnaise and scoop the BBQ chicken onto it. Eat with a side of green beans and corn.
Be careful not to overcook the chicken or it will dry out.
 You can use either hard or soft shell. Pour two teaspoons of vegetable oil in a small nonstick pan over medium heat. Add a tablespoon of minced onion. Sautee two minutes. Then add one pound of shredded chicken, one pinch of cumin, one pinch of chili powder, and Â¼ cup of tomato sauce.


Mix everything together and turn the heat up until the mixture boils.
Then reduce the heat to low and let the mix simmer for about three minutes.
Scoop some of the mix onto your taco shell. Top with cheese, mushrooms, cilantro, or diced bell peppers to taste.

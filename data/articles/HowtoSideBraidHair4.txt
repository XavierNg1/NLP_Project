 Make sure to brush or comb if necessary.









You can place a part in your hair if you wish. If you part your hair on one side of your head, make sure you sweep the hair onto the opposite shoulder.
 Then split the two sections in half so there are four distinct sections.
 This braid can be tricky, so thinking about the hair in parts might help. Number each strand 1-4, left to right. Cross 2 over 1, then cross 4 over 3. Each cross should be right over left. Then, cross 1 over 4, which will be left over right.








Repeat these steps until no more hair is left. Renumber your strands each time you start a new crossover.
 When you have reached the end of your braid, secure it.

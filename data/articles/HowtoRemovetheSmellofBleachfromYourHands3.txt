 These give you the ability to choose from a wide variety of oils to find the one you like the best. Make sure to never apply essential oils directly to the skin as they are, in general, too strong for direct contact. Dilute the essential oil in what is known as a carrier oil and apply as needed. Essential oil examples are:


Lemon
Eucalyptus
Lavendar
Peppermint
Chamomile
Marjoram

, Some examples are:


Sweet almond oil
Hempseed oil
Fractionated coconut oil
Olive oil
Sunflower oil

, A good rule of them is a 2-percent solution. This means approximately one drop of essential oil per ounce of carrier oil., Find the most fragrant flowers or herbs in your yard or purchase them at the store. Then rub the petals or leaves in your fingers and hands to release the fragrant oils within them. Choose such fragrances as:


Roses
Geraniums
Lavendar
Rosemary
Peppermint
Spearmint

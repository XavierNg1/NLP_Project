 Hold down on an app until the apps start to wiggle. Once they have done that, drag on app on top of another until the both go into a folder.


If you wish to add more apps to the folder, repeat the process, dragging the apps into the created folder. It is vital that this is already created before you create the "outside" folder, or else this process will not work. Once nested, this folder will behave like an app (i.e., not being able to add more apps to the folder), so you must add all apps that you want in your folder.;
, Again, hold down the apps until they jiggle, then move them close.
 Choose two apps, then hold down until they start to jiggle. Create the folder, but before you do this, read the next step.
 Do this as if you were adding an app. The nested folder will be moved into the new folder, creating the end result.
 Add them as if you were simply adding them to a normal folder. Hold the apps until they jiggle, then drag them into the folder.
 Hold them until they jiggle, then pull them out. If you remove the nested folder, unfortunately you have to repeat the whole process again for it to work.
 If you wish to hide apps, whether they be embarrassing, or simply inappropriate for a work phone, this is one of many great ways to hide an app.

 Add your olive oil and beeswax to a glass jar, such as a mason jar. Place the jar in a saucepan filled with two inches of water.Heat the pan over medium low heat.
Allow the jar to sit in the pan until the oils melt.
 Once the oils are melted, turn off the heat on the stove and remove your jar. Allow it to cool so the oils melt a bit more. Then, stir the oils together.Set the jar aside and allow the oils to cool off.
 Once the beeswax and olive oil cools, you can add your essential oil. Use a mixing spoon to mix the oils into the beeswax/olive oil mixture. Keep stirring until everything is mixed evenly., This rub should be stored in a sealable metal or tin container. Allow it to set so it forms a more solid, spreadable texture. After it sets, it will be ready for use., As you're working with essential oils, make sure you don't have a sensitivity before applying the rub to your chest. Add a small amount of your rub to a small patch of skin and watch for things like redness, swelling, and skin irritation.If you don't notice a reaction in 48 hours, you can use the rub on your chest.

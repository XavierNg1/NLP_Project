 You should know that Hawai'ian has eight basic consonants, more if you include ones that can be switched in between for each other.

The P in Hawai'ian is the same as the English sound.
In English, the ʔ does not exist. When in written Hawai'ian, it is marked by a ', or 'okina.
K may be substituted for T, but only speakers from Ni'ihau (the one place where Hawai'ian is still a first language) use this dialect.
H may have a soft h, as in honor, or a hard H, as in harangue.
M and N sound just like their English substitutes.
Only in Ni'ihau is N used over L, but out of respect, it is still called Ni'ihau instead of Li'ihau.
Everywhere except Ni'ihau uses the V sound when a W appears. Ewa, for example, is pronounced Evah. (Ever, but with the r dropped.);
, In Hawai'ian, it is Mele Kalikimaka. Mele means Merry, and Kaliki is Christ. That leaves -maka to mean -mas. However, since there are no currently known native Hawai'ian speakers who are also Christians, you will never see Kaliki by itself., This is similar to the English word melee, but shorter vowel sounds. Instead of may LAY, it is MAY lay.
Kaliki: Kaliki is said just how it looks. KAH lee kee. Say this slowly a few times until it rolls off your tongue just like you've been saying it your whole life. Then add Mele; it becomes Mele Kaliki.
Maka: maka is said just like Mach, with an ah sound at the end. MAH kah.

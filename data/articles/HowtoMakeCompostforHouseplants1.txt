 You will need an opaque container that has a lid; the capacity should be around 1 to 3 gallons (4 - 11 L). Small metal garbage cans are ideal for this, as are plastic storage bins with lids.;
, You will want to keep your compost bin close to the kitchen, as this will prevent you from having to trek across your home with your vegetable scraps. Placing the bin under your kitchen sink is an option, but a more attractive compost container could be prominently displayed as part of your d√©cor.
 Use an electric drill to create small holes throughout the sides and bottom of your container. These holes will allow fresh oxygen to circulate into the container, which is essential for the aerobic bacteria that drive decomposition.
 Finally, you'll need to position the bin on top of a shallow pan or tray that will collect any excess water that drips out of the holes in the container's bottom.

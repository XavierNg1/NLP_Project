 They burrow into the littoral sand where the tide meets the shore, and they scavenge most of their food from what they find buried in the sand. The term "sand crab" describes a variety of large (often predatory) and small (often scavenging) species, and you must suit any feeding regimen to your particular crab. Consider the differences between large and small sand crabs:


Larger sand crabs tend to feed on live or decaying prey that they find while burrowing. This prey may include smaller crabs, baby turtles, and the carcasses of dead shorebirds. As larger crabs burrow, they aerate the sand. This helps to keep air and water circulating in their habitats.Smaller sand crabs feed on mollusks, worms, plankton, and algae. They are mostly scavengers: they keep their ecosystem clear of decomposing organic matter, which could host harmful bacteria.;
, The crabs bury themselves in the sand, facing the ocean, with only their eyes and front antennae exposed. When the tide recedes and washes over them, they unfurl a second set of antennae that filter tiny plankton from the water. The movement happens very quickly. Thus, a sand crab can gather several morsels from each receding wave.


Most crabs can move in any direction—forward, backward and sideways—but a sand crab moves only backward. Thus, it must position itself carefully to reap its meals from the waves.
 In the wild, mating occurs mostly in spring and summer. A female may produce as many as 45,000 eggs. She carries them on her abdomen until the eggs hatch – about 30 days later. For two to four months, the larvae drift as plankton, and currents can carry them far across the sea.Sand crabs can reproduce during their first year of life if the water is warm enough. They don't usually live longer than two to three years.

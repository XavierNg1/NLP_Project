 You'll need five sheets of paper and some glue. A glue stick or some craft glue will work the best.


The dimensions of your paper will affect the size of your cardboard, so use smaller paper if you want a smaller piece of cardboard.
Using more sheets of paper will result in thicker cardboard.
If using liquid glue, consider spreading out some newspaper to catch any glue that drips off of your cardboard.;
, Spread your glue on one side of a sheet of paper, then align a second sheet of paper and stick them together. The corners and edges should align as closely as possible. This will form the foundation for your cardboard.
 Run the heel of your hand across the foundation, both from the bottom of the page to the top and from side to side. Make sure all sides and corners are glued together.


If any edges or corners are loose, pull them apart as little as possible and add more glue. Reattach the sheets and press together again.
 Spread glue on the top page of your foundation, then align and attach another sheet of paper. Make sure to line up the corners and edges before sticking the pages together. Firmly press down on the foundation after each sheet of paper is added to make sure all of the paper is staying glued together. Continue to add sheets onto the foundation until your cardboard is the desired thickness.


Adding more sheets of paper will increase the thickness of your cardboard.
 Put your cardboard under a fan or in a warm location to speed up the drying process.


Be patient! If the glue doesn't dry completely your cardboard may fall apart.

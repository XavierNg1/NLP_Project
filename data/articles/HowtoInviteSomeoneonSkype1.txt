 This icon is at the top right of the Contacts screen, signified by a person with a plus (+) sign.
 As you type, Skype will search through your current iPhone contacts. It will also display a link that says “Tap to find new contacts.”

 Tap the user’s icon or name to launch his or her contact request screen.
 The standard text is: Hi, I’d like to add you on Skype, but it can be edited to include your own personal touch. You can delete the entire message or simply add a few words to the original.
 Once that user accepts your request, you’ll be able to interact with them. Until then, your new contact will have a question mark (?) next to their name.
 This step is optional, but can be useful if you want Skype to automatically search your iPhone contacts for Skype users.

, Showtime is currently available with 65 cable providers in the United States.
 If switching your cable provider is an option in your area, you may be able to sign up for a satellite package that includes Showtime at very little extra cost for the first 6 months or 1 year.


Call your cable provider back with the comparison shopping research you have done. Threatening to discontinue your service may allow the customer service representative to be more flexible with the costs of subscribing to Showtime.
 Providers like Comcast and DirecTV have an "In Demand" feature that lets you stream Dexter and other shows on your computer, Internet TV and even some gaming consoles.
 Most accounts will be set up with the email and password you set up with your cable provider; however, others may ask you to create a separate name and password for extra security.
 This will allow you to stream Dexter through the app, rather than opening a browser and going to Sho.com.
 You can use your computer or an Internet TV to access new and old episodes of Dexter.

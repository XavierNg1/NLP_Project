 A gram is a metric unit of weight that is equal to one thousandth of a kilogram.A calorie is a unit of energy that people receive from food. One pound of body fat is equal to about 3500 calories.A gram and a calorie are different units of measure that can't be converted into one another.
 The quantity of calories per gram of food is dependent upon its ratio of macro-nutrients. The human body can derive energy (employ calories) from three main macro-nutrients: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.You can't weigh food and convert the grams into calories. You have to know how many calories there are in a specific type of macro-nutrient gram to calculate the total calories in it.
 Look on the label of the food your want to calculate the calories for. Each nutrient will be listed in grams. Once you find the one you are looking for, you can multiply that number by the number of calories that specific nutrient has in each gram.

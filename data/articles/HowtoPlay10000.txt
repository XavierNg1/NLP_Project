 You can do this, for instance, by having each player roll three dice and starting with whoever gets the highest combination. Play proceeds clockwise from this player.;
, If the roll has no scoring combinations, 1's or 5's, the player's turn ends. If the roll has scoring dice, the player may choose to roll all six again or keep any of his/her scoring dice and roll the others to create lucrative scoring combinations.Â 

, Various combinations of numbers score points in 10,000. See below for a list of scoring combinations:


Any die that shows '1' is worth 100 points
Any die that shows '5' is worth 50 points
A Three-of-a-Kind is worth a hundred times the number on the dice, with the exception of three '1's, which is worth 1000 points.
Any additional matching numbers past three of a kind double the point worth (i.e. 4+4+4=400 while 4+4+4+4=800).
Three pairs is worth 1000 points.
A five-dice straight (1+2+3+4+5 or 2+3+4+5+6) is worth 500 points.
A six-dice straight (1+2+3+4+5+6) is worth 1500 points.
A six-of-a-kind of 1's automatically wins!

, After your first six-dice roll, if you wish, you can roll smaller numbers of dice to continue scoring points. When you decide to stop rolling, record the points you've made during your turn on a score table.


Note: Any dice set aside can not be used to make a combination with any rolled dice, i.e., setting aside two '5's and then rolling another '5' only gains you 150 points instead of 500.
 If, at any point during your turn (including your first roll), a roll doesn't contain any scoring dice, your turn ends and you make no points. This is what makes continued rolling risky - the possibility of making more points must be weighed with the risk of losing everything you've earned so far during your turn.
 Once a player reaches 10,000 points, the game isn't over! At this point, everyone has one turn left to try to beat the leading player's score before the game ends. If no one can, she/he wins!

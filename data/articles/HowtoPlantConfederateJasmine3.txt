 Even though your seedling may not need this space yet, Confederate jasmine expands rapidly, and it will need this extra room soon enough. The pot must also have several drainage holes.
 Doing so prevents soil from falling through but allows water to pass out.
 Use a nutrient-rich, well-draining mix, like one composed of soil, compost, and sand.
 Push down on the stake until it stands against the bottom. Pack soil around it until the pole is firmly fixed in place.
 Tip the seedling container onto its side and gently squeeze the plastic with one hand. With the other hand, guide or "wiggle" the jasmine out. The soil should remain intact around the roots.
 Add more potting mix around it until it you bring the soil level up to where it was in its seedling container. Pack the soil around the seedling to keep it firmly in place.
 Use a watering can to pour water onto the soil until the surface looks visibly damp. Pause for a minute or so after you water the soil to allow the water to settle. If the surface no longer appears damp, give the soil more water. Continue pausing and watering until the surface stays wet even after you allow the water to settle.
 Stop once the top of the soil is about 2 inches (5 centimeters) below the rim of the pot.

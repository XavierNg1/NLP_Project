 Injury is another common reason that people develop lower back issues. Protect your back while lifting items by using the proper methods of lifting that avoid back strain. This is important even when you are young, as minor injuries that do not affect you immediately may make you more susceptible to more serious injuries later on., Approach an object you intend to lift and stand as close as possible to it. Spread your feet apart to provide yourself a wide base of support. Essentially, position yourself so that you're able to bend at your knees and grip the object either between or just in front of your feet. Never position yourself in a way that will require you to bend at your waist or at your back., After safely positioning and gripping and object, tighten and maintain the flex of your stomach muscles as you lift an object. Always raise and lower an object straight up and down, holding it close to your body and using the muscles in your legs. Again, do not bend or twist when lifting, lowering, or carrying a heavy item.When setting something down, do so with a squatting motion, keeping your back straight and using the muscles in your legs to bare the load.
 Get help lifting anything that you are not absolutely certain you can lift safely on your own. If an item is awkwardly shaped, or is heavier than items you commonly lift with ease, have someone else help you lift it. Whenever available, use dollies or other tools and machines to help you move heavy objects.

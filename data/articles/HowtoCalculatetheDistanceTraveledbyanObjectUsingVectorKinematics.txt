 This can be done using a simple mathematical compass.;
, This information can usually be found on the gun’s package or the manufacturer's website. The initial velocity of the projectile varies, depending on the gun model and ammunition type.
, This can be done using the sine and cosine functions. For example, if the angle of launch is 30o, then the sine of 30o, multiplied by the initial velocity, would be the initial velocity in the y-direction. This can easily be done by using this trigonometric function on a calculator: sin(30) * vo. Then, repeat this step, using the cosine function to determine the initial velocity in the x-direction.
 The definition of each variable is as follows: y=final (y-direction) position, yo=starting (y-direction position), voy=initial velocity in the y-direction (calculated in step 4.), g=force of gravity acting on the projectile (assuming we are on earth, this value should be (-9.80m/s2), and t=the time it takes for the projectile to hit the ground. To make this step simpler, solve for (t) using the following equation: t=((y – yo – voy)/.5g)1/2.

For example, assuming the final y-position was zero (because the bullet will lose momentum and hit the ground), the initial y-position was 1.5m, the initial y-velocity was 20m/s, and the force of gravity (g) was -9.80m/s2, it should've taken 13.6 seconds for the bullet to hit the ground.
 Using the equation x = vxo t, supply the missing variables vxo=initial (x-direction) velocity, calculated in step 4, t=time for projectile to travel (calculated in step 5). For example, if the initial x-velocity was 20m/s and the bullet's airtime was 15 seconds, the horizontal distance that the bullet travelled was 300 meters (984.3 ft).

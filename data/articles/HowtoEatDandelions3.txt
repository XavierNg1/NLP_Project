 Cut the white bulb from the green stems. Dice the bulb into pieces approximately ¼-inch (0.6 cm) in size. Then slice the stems thinly. Next, wash and dry the dandelions. Trim the flowers from the greens, and then chop the greens up., Pour it into a large saucepan and then cover the pan. Turn the burner to low-medium heat. Reduce or turn off the heat before it comes to a boil. Keep it covered to prevent it from evaporating., Coat the bottom of a large skill with the oil. Add the butter and turn the heat to medium. Stir the butter around as it melts to coat the bottom evenly., Add the diced white onions to the skillet first. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the onions turn translucent. Then add the rice and stir it in, adding more oil if necessary to coat it. Saute for one more minute., Start by stirring the wine into the rice and onions. Once the rice has absorbed all the moisture, pour in ½ cup (118 ml) of the stock and stir it in. Once the rice has absorbed that, keep adding a ½ cup of stock at a time. Add the dandelion greens about 10 minutes into this process., As you start nearing the end of your stock, take test bites of the rice before adding more. When the rice turns al dente, add one last ¼ cup (59 ml) of stock. Then stir in your grated cheese, plus salt and pepper, if desired. Garnish with the green slices of onion and dandelion petals and serve immediately.Store leftovers in an airtight container and refrigerate. Eat within the next couple days.

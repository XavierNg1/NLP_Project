 This is similar to a push-up motion. Flex your stomach muscles and make sure your back is straight. Exhale when you bend your elbows., Inhale when you push up. Keep your back straight and your stomach muscles tight., Work toward doing 4 sets of 12 reps. For an added challenge, place your feet on a step or another raised platform and do the pike press.

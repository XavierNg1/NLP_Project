 Hand feeding a puppy is a great way to prevent the development of food aggression. It teaches the dog that people are not threatening and that they provide food. Try hand feeding your dog an entire meal by giving them small pieces of kibble at a time. You can also hand feed your dog treats throughout their training. This will develop trust between you and your puppy.Do not attempt to hand feed an adult dog that already displays signs of food guarding and aggression.
 When you are hand feeding your puppy, use your other hand to pet your dog. This will get them comfortable with you around and they will not get nervous or aggressive in the future.
 Slowly approach your puppyâ€™s bowl while they are eating and drop a treat into the bowl. Use a treat that is more appealing than the food they are currently eating, such as chicken or beef. This will help the puppy associate people approaching their bowl with a positive treat.

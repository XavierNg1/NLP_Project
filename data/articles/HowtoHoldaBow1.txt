 Hold the bow in a vertical position using your non-dominant hand. With your dominant hand, form a loose ring with your thumb and both the middle and ring fingers.


Note that your index and pinky fingers should naturally curve down toward your thumb, as well. Do not touch your thumb with those fingers, but keep them relaxed and perched in that curved position.;
, With the bow hair facing you, gently open the ring you created so that you can slide the stick of the bow inside.


The stick should rest on your thumb right at the point where the frog (the device where the bow hair is held and can be adjusted) meets the leather bow grip.
 Bring the index and ring fingers down over the opposite side of the frog. The pads of those fingers should rest directly on the frog.


Your index finger should rest around the stick at a finger's space away from the middle finger, and the pinky should curve and rest on top of the bow stick.
You should gently hold the bow without gripping it. Your fingers should be curved in a natural, relaxed form, and your joints should not be stiff. Your palm should also remain soft.
 But you should be relaxed and accept gradual changes in this position as you move your bow along the instrument.


In general, your fingers will be more arched during a down stroke, but during an upstroke your fingers will become more elongated.
 While playing, be sure that you keep your hands and joints free from tension. It should be a comfortable and relaxed grip.

Your first and second finger joints should all be bent slightly, with no hyperextensions. Otherwise you will not have a lot of control and your strokes will be short.

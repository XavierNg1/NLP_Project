 First, lay down. Then put your hands palms down near your shoulders. Lift your body up with your arms. Keep your head in line with your spine. Raise your body up and down. Try to do ten pushups at first. Then, increase your repetitions gradually.You can modify pushups by pivoting on your bent knees rather than on your feet. Lean forward to find the correct push up position. Raise and lower your body.
You can also hold the push up position as a plank. Squeeze your abdominals together.;
, Collect two dumbbells. If you are an inexperienced lifter, try 5 lb. dumbbells. If you have lifted more often, start with 10 lb. weights. Lay down on the floor or on a weight bench. Bring the dumbbells downwards to your chest and rest them there. Then lift them upwards while breathing out. Do not let the weights touch each other.Do two or three sets of fifteen repetitions. Stop if you experience any pain.
Consider working with a personal trainer or taking a lifting class before starting any intense weight regimen.
 Lie flat on your back, either on the ground or on a bench. Bend your knees if you are on the floor and make sure your back does not lift off the ground at any time during the exercise. Lay your arms out to form a "T" with your body, with a dumbbell in each hand. Lift your arms and bring your hands toward each other above your chest. Do not touch the dumbbells â€” keep your arms straight and in-line with your shoulders., Find space on a flat wall (e.g. without windows). Face the wall. Stand with your forward foot twelve inches from the wall. Keep your other foot a step behind you. Place your hands (palms up) against the wall. They should be in line with your shoulders and about two feet from one another. Bend your elbows.Press against the wall for ten seconds. Repeat two times.

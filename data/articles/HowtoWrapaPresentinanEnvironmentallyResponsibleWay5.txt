 Separate items that are recycle-able (paper, boxes, tissue) from items that are not (plastic tape, ribbon, cellophane wrapping). Recycle appropriate wrappings, boxes, and other paper products as per your local recycling district. If possible, compost such items as unbleached paper, boxes, and the like. Be sure to follow through on your plans to re-cover your textbooks, craft projects, and the like!

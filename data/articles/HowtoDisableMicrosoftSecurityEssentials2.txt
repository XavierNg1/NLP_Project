 Hold down the Windows key on your keyboard, it should be to the left of the Alt key, then press the R key once. A small window will open in the lower left-hand corner of your screen. In this window, type “msconfig” then hit Enter.
 Inside this tab is a list of different programs that start each time the PC boots up.
 Under the “Startup Item” section of this list, look for “Microsoft Security Client.” There should be a checkbox to the left of it. Uncheck the checkbox to disable MSE.


Click “Apply” at the bottom right of the window, then click the “OK” button to continue.
 After hitting “OK,” a pop-up will appear asking you to restart the PC to make the changes take effect. Click “Restart” to do so.


Now, MSE will no longer automatically start when you turn on your PC.

 One helpful way to do this is by placing a piece of tap on all the keys and labeling them.;
, You will be using the keys F, G, A and C of the lower side of the piano. In order to do this, you could follow these arrangements for your left hand:


Place pinky on the F key.
Place ring finger on the G key.
Place middle/index finger on the A key.
Place your thumb on the C key.

Continue practicing playing these keys smoothly until you are able to without much concentration.



Start by pressing the middle C three times.
Wait after a second, hit the C again and continue playing byÂ descending down. Play the keys left of C: B and A.
Now ascend again by playing B, C, D and hit the E three times.
Hit the E once more, then play the two descending keys of it: D and C.
Continue by playing the ascending keys D, E, F and G.
After playing the key G, pause for a second and play the C you initially started at.
Now you're going to wait another second before playing the A key right of the C.
Descend from A by playing G, F, E, D, C, B, A, G, F.
Finish by ascending from F, playing F# (the black key to the right of F), G, A, B, and stopping at C.
 Once you've mastered both the keys of your left and right hands, you will be able to play the melody.
 Your left hand should play each of the four notes only after a second passes: play C, pause for a second, play A, pause for a second, play F, pause for a second, play G, pause for a second, and repeat.


Your right hand's tempo is quicker than the left hand's and only slows down for a second after specific keys. Begin by playing both hands simultaneously.
 Don't feel discouraged if it seems hard to get at first. You can do it!

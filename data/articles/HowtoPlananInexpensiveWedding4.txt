Perhaps you can choose just one attendant each for the bride and groom will cut down on costs--and really, these are still optional.
 Fewer guests means that you can book a smaller place and provide food for fewer people. Think about who youâ€™d most like to share this occasion with.
 It can be a nice gesture to invite family or friends who live far away, even if it is unlikely they will attend. Think about who you should invite and who might decline the invitation. This will help with planning numbers. But keep in mind these faraway friends relatives may decide to come for the wedding. Many use it as a reason to take a holiday. So do not entirely count out "courtesy invites"!

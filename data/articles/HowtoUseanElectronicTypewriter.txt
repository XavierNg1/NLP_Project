One paper will go next to the platen to protect it from damaging and the other one is on top for typing.

Most electronic typewriters have the new button for setting margins.

Be sure that you press the return key every end of the line to move to the next line. Otherwise, it will just beep in there.
Most electronics have the Lift off feature. It removes typos (errors) off the paper when you press the key. Then you can type the correct word/character after it lifts the error off.
Some electronic typewriters have the Automatic carriage return. When you reach the end of the line, the carrier will automatically return by itself.

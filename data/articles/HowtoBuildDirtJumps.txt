 The takeoff ramp needs to be curved up to a steep lip about 45-75 degrees at the top, or else you overshoot and crash.

Remember that when you compact the dirt mounds, they get smaller. One good way not to push the wheelbarrow all the time is to put one and half times what you desire to have as the height of the jump (for example, a beginner that wants a jump 3 feet high actually needs 4.5 feet of dirt because of the loss from compaction) so you won't waste time shoveling again and pushing that wheelbarrow every time you need a little dirt.
Make the lip of the jump flat so you can get as much air as possible.

, Another good idea is to use a roller this will help compact your jump and make them smoother and better. If the spaded shovel doesn't help just get a compacter and pack it down.
 In addition, it makes the dirt more malleable.
 Make them progressively bigger. Add berms and rollers to maintain and gather speed.
 If in a tight area, just land & slow down, turn around, and do it again.

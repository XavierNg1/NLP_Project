 However, a toothbrush or generic clean scrub brush will also work.


The bristles on your brush should be fairly stiff to clean well.
This method works well for getting the scuff and dirt marks off of suede shoes.
First, lightly brush across the suede in one direction to remove the top layer of dirt.
Then, brush back and forth over the area of suede with the stain. Use short, quick strokes to avoid making any marks on your suede.;
, Once you’ve brushed off all the dirt that you can, use an eraser to rub over the stain area.Art gum erasers work best for this task. Don’t use a colored eraser, as this can make the stain worse rather than erasing it.
Don’t be afraid to rub at the stain vigorously.
Consider laying out a towel as your work station, as the eraser can get messy and leave small pieces on your floor, table, or clothes.
 Brush and erase your suede stain several times before moving on to another method of stain removal. It can take a bit of time and elbow grease to really remove a stain.


This method is great because it doesn’t involve any cleaning substances that could potential harm or mark your suede.

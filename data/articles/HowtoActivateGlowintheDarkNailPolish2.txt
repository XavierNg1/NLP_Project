Once you see the stick glowing, it’s ready to use. Next, you should take a pair of scissors, and cut the glow stick in half.
Make sure that your scissors are sharp, so that you can more easily cut through the glow stick. Be careful when using scissors though that you don’t cut yourself.
Cut the glow stick slowly and on a paper towel or plate, while being careful that none of the liquid spills out of the stick.
Use the paper towel or plate as a stopgap under the glow stick as you cut it, in case a little bit of it does spill out. Try not to get the contents on your clothes.
 Take one cut end of the stick, and place it into the nail polish bottle.


Squeeze the glow stick as if it’s a tube in order to get the glowing liquid inside the glow stick into the nail polish bottle.
If you cut both ends of the tube, the liquid should flow into the nail polish bottle more easily, but cut the top end after you’ve put the tube into the bottle.
Put the cap back on the nail polish bottle, and shake it vigorously! This is important so the glow liquid disburses throughout the nail polish evenly.

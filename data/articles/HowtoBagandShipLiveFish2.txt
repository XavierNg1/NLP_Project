 Place the betta in clean water and starve him/her for about two days. Watch for disease.
 Use plastic bags designed for packing fish only. Only fill the bag enough to cover the betta, no more. Place the fish in the bag and fill it with air (be gentle).
 Place the bags containing the bettas in a styrofoam box. Fill the empty space with packing peanuts or newspaper. Place the Styrofoam box in a cardboard box that is labeled Live Fish.
 Make sure to contact the buyer and make sure they will be there when the shipment will arrive. Only use Air Cargo or Express Mail; many fish have died when shipped through Priority Mail.

 In order to transform a skirt into a halter top, the garment must meet certain standards. The skirt must fit over your ribcage. The garment must also have side seamsâ€”one side seam will become your center seam. Lastly, the skirt your purchase or recycle for this project should be flowy or a-line., Slide the skirt under your arms. Turn the the skirt so that one of the side seams runs down the center of your chest. One strap will be attached to each side of the front seam.


If the skirt has a side zipper, feature this detail by making it your front seam.
 Unravel your ribbon on a flat surface. Measure and cut two lengths of ribbon approximately 1 foot each. Pin the end of one ribbon to the inside of the skirt just right of the center seam. Pin the end of the second ribbon to the inside of the skirt just left of the center seam. Thread a needle and attach each ribbon to the skirt with top stitches., Step into the skirt and pull it up to your chest. Turn the skirt so that the side seam with the ribbons attached on either side is in front. Tie the ribbons behind your neck.

 Once two or more values have been entered into a horizontal row, simply click on the cell immediately to the right of the last cell with a value entered therein. Then select the AutoSum function, which can be found under either the Home tab or the Formulas tab, and Excel will automatically create a formula based on the range of data contained in that row to the left of the cell you've clicked. Press ↵ Enter to accept its specified range or drag your cursor across your preferred range in the event Excel guesses wrong (and then press ↵ Enter).
 Begin by clicking on the cell below the final entry of data in the column containing your initial sums, and then select AutoSum once again. Excel will automatically create a formula based on the range of data contained in the column above the cell you've selected. Just as you did when calculating the sum of each row, press ↵ Enter to accept its specified range or drag your cursor across your preferred range in the event Excel guesses wrong (and then press ↵ Enter). Excel will automatically generate your final sum total in the specified cell.To avoid enter a similar formula for each row, you may simply copy and paste your initial formula to subsequent rows. Excel will automatically adjust the formula to add cells from the new row.
You may calculate the sums of multiple rows or columns at the same time by selecting multiple cells before selecting AutoSum. For calculating the sums for multiple rows, simply select the appropriate range of cells in the column to the right of the cells containing their rows' final values. For calculating the sums of multiple columns, select the appropriate range of cells in the row below the cells containing their columns' final values.

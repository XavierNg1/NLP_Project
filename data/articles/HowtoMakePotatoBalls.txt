 Grab a tablespoon of the mashed potatoes and use your hands to roll them into small balls. Place the potato balls on a dish.
 Drop the potato balls in the hot oil, only adding a couple at a time. Have the balls cook for about 3 minutes, until they are crispy and golden brown. Place them on a dish covered with a napkin.
 Serve the potato balls immediately while they are warm with tomato ketchup or sour cream. Enjoy!

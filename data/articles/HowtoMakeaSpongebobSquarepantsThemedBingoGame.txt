 Instead of having "BINGO" at the top of the cards, substitute it with "OCEAN" or "PATTY". Make it creative.;
, You might think of things like the characters, Krusty Krab, the ocean in general, Spongebob's hobbies, etc. Get or print out images of the characters themselves and place them on the cards. You can also make fun questions about the television show and have the answers on the cards.


What is Spongebob's job? (Fry cook)
Who is Spongebob's boss? (Mr. Krabs)
What does Spongebob live in? (A pineapple)
What is the name of Spongebob's driving teacher? (Mrs. Puff)
What does Mr. Krabs love? (Money)
Where does Patrick live? (Under a rock)

, It's up to you to use the same keywords on every card or have different cards say other terms. This is useful when lots of terms are built up or allow people to have the opportunity to find different things from others. If you are using all character images, be sure to write down all of them so that you can call them out.
 Make sure that everyone has enough time so that they know what they're looking for beforehand.
 Have the kids eliminate the term found on their card.


If the cards won't be used in the future, you can have them cross them out with a marker. You can always preserve them for future games and use tokens or coins to cover them.
 Once a person's card is completely blacked out first, then a winner can be declared. Depending on the complexity of the keywords, people can complete a standard Bingo row or column (up, down, or diagonal).

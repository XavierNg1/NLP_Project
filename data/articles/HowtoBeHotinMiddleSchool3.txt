 You can't be considered "hot" if you remind people of a stereotypical little girl by complaining constantly, over-reacting, and picking fights with others. Work on having common sense, keeping your attitude cool, and being polite to everyone you come in contact with.
 In order to be considered "hot", you have to put yourself out there. Make good first impressions, and have fun with those who lift you up. Laugh often, be charming, be inclusive, and try to talk to as many people as you can in one day, but don't overdo it, or people may think that you are annoying.

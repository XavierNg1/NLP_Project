 Solve the practice problems in basic books like Let Us C or Beginning Programming with C for Dummies. This will help you master the basics and get you ready to move on to harder problems.;
, A book like ANSI C or even The C Programming Language has a lot of essential information. It can be hard to read, so tackle it slowly and make sure you understand every sentence you read. The time you spend understanding a text like this will pay off in your coding.


If you stumble upon something in an example that you can't understand or haven't learned yet, don't panic. Try to dissect the program into parts and look up each part separately online or in the books you have.
 The best way to learn to code is simply to do it. Tackle more and more complicated problems as you gain confidence and skills. Use your practice to test and cement your book learning.
 Most of the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) projects have their sources hosted upon Github, consult their official website for related links.


Pay attention to coding style, documentation, indentation and other standard practices. Compare this with your programs and ask yourself "Is my code on par with this? If not, what's missing?"

, There are many online platforms like official C language forums, IRC help, Stack Exchange websites. Chances are, someone else has run into your problem and has found a way around it. Learn from fellow programmers by consulting online material as much as you can.


If you are a student or co-developer of a project, ask your colleagues, friends, and teachers to help. Working as a group can be a great way to learn from others and polish up your skills.

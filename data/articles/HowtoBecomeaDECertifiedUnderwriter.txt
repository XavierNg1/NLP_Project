Keep in mind that the courses will not guarantee certification and that training schools that offer them are not accredited by HUD as they do not have specific accreditation requirements. Therefore, training schools cannot promise that an underwriter is guaranteed DE-certification.;
,


The lender may require you to test for an underwriting position, and you may have to provide copies of any certificates you received from the DE Certification courses you have taken. Because HUD does request that the underwriter have fifteen to twenty test cases before being recommended for direct endorsement certification, it could take some time before you move onto the next step.



The lender will submit the information to HUD through the Computerized Homes Underwriting Management System (CHUMS) using the Lender Access System (CLAS).
CHUMS checks the underwriter against the Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS) file. Once approved, CLAS sends an Underwriter Update Report with the underwriters CHUMS identification number to the lender, and the underwriter is officially certified.

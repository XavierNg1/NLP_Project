 If you are constantly deferring to other people, or letting people walk all over you in a conversation, you need to speak up. It’s not that you have to be confrontational. It’s more that you express yourself confidently. You don’t have to agree with other people’s opinions or plans for them to like you. If a guy bails because you speak up for yourself, he’s probably not the kind of guy you want around anyway.For instance, if you aren't comfortable with a situation, staying out past curfew for example, you can say, "I'm not going to stay out late. I'll be grounded for sure, and I really want to be able to hang out again soon." This can let them know that you aren't willing to get in trouble for them, but that you are interested in hanging out again.
 Often, people are shy because they think they aren’t interesting enough for a guy to notice. They hide themselves away rather than do what they think would embarrass them. However, the people who exude the most confidence are often people who are willing to try new things, whether they’re in front of people or not. You can always start small (talking to people you admire), or jump right in (go bungee jumping). Either way, once you’ve started, it get easier to make it a habit., This doesn’t mean letting it all go (unless you are comfortable doing this). However, if you are constantly wondering if people care what you’re wearing, then you might want to reconsider your outfits. Don’t worry about others’ opinions, but wear what makes you feel good. People, especially guys, will notice your confidence rather than your outfit, when you love what you wear.

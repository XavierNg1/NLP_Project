 Age-wise, start as soon as you get the puppy; tricks can help your puppy bond with you, and teach good manners. The optimal time of day to start training your Chihuahua is just before lunchtime, when they are hungry and will do tricks for treats.

Don't start training when your dog is sleepy, overworked, or otherwise stressed.
Keep the training sessions short, sweet, and fun, with lots of pets and treats.

, Find the perfect balance between size, flavour, and healthiness to get the perfect treat!

Treats should be bite-sized, so that you can quickly reward your dog. Also, you don't want your Chihuahua to get fat, so having tiny treats is better for their health than large treats.
Find treats that your dog likes, whether it's peanut butter ones or salmon skin ones.
Don't choose treats that make your dog get diarrhea, or have a lot of chemicals. Also, try and choose meat-based as opposed to grain-based treats.
Of course, you could always use your dog's kibble as treats.
 Make sure you and your Chihuahua are comfortable, and your chosen treats are at hand. Have a lot of patience, and know exactly what tricks you are going to work on.

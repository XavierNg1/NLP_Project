How long will my dog need radiation therapy?
How much will radiation therapy cost?
Can I touch my dog after treatment sessions?
When will my dog start feeling better after radiation therapy?
Is the radiation dangerous to my dog?

, Palliation is the relief of pain and discomfort, without the goal of a cure. As opposed to radiation therapy for long-term cancer control, palliative radiation therapy is less intense and is recommended for dogs that are not healthy enough to undergo full-course radiation therapy.Palliative radiation therapy treatment sessions are usually once a week for several weeks.Talk with your vet to decide if treating the cancer or relieving your dogâ€™s discomfort is your main goal.

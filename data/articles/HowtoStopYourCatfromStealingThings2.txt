 Cats do not respond well to negative reinforcement. Instead of yelling at your cat or spraying it with a spray bottle, ignore it when it does something bad.Cats often respond defiantly to anger. In contrast, ignoring the cat will teach it that nothing positive will come from stealing your things.
 If you know that your cat likes to steal one particular item, hide it so that your cat can’t reach it. Otherwise, try to keep the likely suspects out of your cat’s reach. Their favorite objects to steal include: strings, stretchy items, and anything that rolls.Be especially careful about anything that your cat could eat. Eating household items could pose a serious health risk for your kitty., In some rare instances, your cat might be eating unusual items because of a medical condition known as Pica. This can be a symptom of other, very serious illnesses. If your cat persists in eating items after all your best efforts, visit a veterinarian for a check-up.

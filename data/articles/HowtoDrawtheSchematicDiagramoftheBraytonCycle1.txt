 The gas turbine is the component that produces mechanical power from the gases that circulate through the system. It is represented by an isosceles trapezoid. This looks like the side view of a funnel where the area goes larger from left to right. This shows that the gas expands as it goes through the turbine.
 This components compresses the gas to a higher pressure. This is represented by an isosceles trapezoid like the turbine; however, the area goes smaller from left to right to show the compression of the gas., This is where the gas is heated to a higher temperature via combustion. It is simply represented by a rectangle. Label it as "Combustion Chamber" or "CC"., A heat exchanger can be used to add or remove heat from the gas; it may be classified as a gas heater or gas cooler. It is represented by a rectangle with zigzag lines inside. The zigzag lines look like how a resistor is represented in circuit diagrams., Now that you have learned how to draw the components, you are now ready to arrange them to draw the different types of the Brayton Cycle: direct-open, direct-closed, indirect-open, and indirect-closed.

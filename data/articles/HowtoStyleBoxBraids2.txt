 Spread the braids downward around the perimeter of the head. Let them hang, covering your ears, face, and back.
 Pick a starting point about 2.5 inches (6cm) in front of your ear. Start French braiding three smaller braids together. Continue around the perimeter of your head, adding more braids as you go.
 Once you've completed the perimeter braid, tuck and pin down the ends with a hairpin.

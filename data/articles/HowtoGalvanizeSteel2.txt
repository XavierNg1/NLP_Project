 The steel must be cleaned and de-rusted before the electrogalvanization can occur.
 Either zinc sulfate or zinc cyanide is normally used for the electrolyte.
 The solution will react with the steel to cause the zinc to precipitate onto the steel, coating it. The longer the steel is left in the electrolyte, the thicker the coating that will be produced.


While this method offers greater control over how thick the zinc coating is than does hot-dip galvanizing, it usually does not allow for layers to become as thick.

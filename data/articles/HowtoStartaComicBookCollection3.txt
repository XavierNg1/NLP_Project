 A comic book binder with clear plastic sleeves will help prevent folding and tearing when comic books are kept on a bookshelf or in a box. Using a filing cabinet is another option.


Paperback and hardback collections can be stored on a bookshelf as usual.
 Store your comics in a dry area at room temperature. Keep them away from direct sunlight. If they are kept in a storage area instead of on the shelf, keep them in plastic bags to minimize water damage.
 Keep issues from the same series together, and order them by issue number. Use folder dividers to separate series kept on the same shelf or in the same container.
 Purchase plastic slips to further protect your most valuable issues. Keep these in a secure place in a designated area of your comic collection, so you can easily locate them. When handling them, wear latex gloves to prevent leaving traces of skin oil on the pages.

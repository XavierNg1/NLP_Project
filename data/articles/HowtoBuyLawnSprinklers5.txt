 These sprinklers are unique, because they travel along a hose as they water the lawn. The hose is put in place, and the sprinkler is self-propelled along the hose.


Traveling sprinklers are expensive to purchase. The metal type seems to hold up better than ones with plastic parts.
This type of sprinkler is quiet when operating. Once it is put in place, it is easy to operate.

 Most lap harp kits include a tuning key (small "L"-shaped silver instrument with a hole to fit over the tuning pegs on the side(s) of the instrument and a handle to turn it), a pick (which will make strumming and note quality easier and better), and most have music that you can insert below the strings, which marks the names of the notes on all the strings. Some kits may even have a separate sheet with all the notes marked and tuning instructions. Be sure to have something of this sort so that you'll know what notes each string is supposed to play. In addition to all of this, you will need a tuner, preferably a small electronic one.;
, You'll be tuning to a frequency of 440 Hz (hertz), sometimes displayed on the tuner as A = 440. Keep in mind that the lap harp is not a transposing instrument, so the note you see on the screen when you play a note will be in concert pitch.
 Is the note displayed even the note that this string is supposed to be playing? If it isn't, note how many half or whole steps it is away from the intended note. Also note which way the needle is pointing - if you're already on the correct note, is it flat or sharp?

, To correct a note that has gone a little bit flat, ever so slightly tighten the string. Do the opposite to correct a sharp pitch. If you're on a completely different note, tighten the string to make the note higher, or loosen it to make it lower. Be very careful not to over tighten the strings!

, This may be slow and tedious work, so take plenty of breaks. If you come across a particularly difficult string, you may wish to ask someone else for help, or get back to it later. Check your progress periodically by playing up and down through the strings you've tuned... you'll start to notice the instrument sounding a lot better.
 It sounds a lot better now, doesn't it? It's only a matter of time before it'll need to be re-tuned, so enjoy it while it lasts!

 Place the ham hocks, sauerkraut, onion, carrot, allspice berries, peppercorns, bay leaf, and salt in a large stockpot or Dutch oven. Pour in enough water to cover the ingredients, especially the meat.
 Heat the contents of the pot on high until the water begins to boil rapidly. Once this happens, reduce the heat to medium or medium-low.


Do not cover the pot as you boil or simmer the contents.
 Let the contents of the stockpot cook at a steady simmer for an hour or so, just until the meat softens and starts falling off the bone.


When the water level starts to drop as the water gets cooked away, add more, keeping the level continuously above the contents of the pot.
Remove the bay leaf once the ingredients finish cooking.
 As soon as the meat finishes cooking, spoon out the sauerkraut stew into individual serving dishes. Top with some of the meat, and enjoy.


This dish is often served with cooked potatoes.
Mustard, horseradish, or mustard with horseradish is also commonly served on the side an an accompaniment for the meat.

 There are a large variety of third-party programs that will allow you to track devices that have the program installed. Each phone that you want to track will need to have the application installed on the phone. Popular apps include: GPS Tracking Pro (Android) and GPS TRACKER (iOS).


There are also GPS tracking apps that disguise themselves, such as GPS Tracker Hidden for Android. In order to install a hidden tracking app on an iPhone, the iPhone you want to track will need to be jailbroken.
There is no method of tracking a phone unless you have personally installed the application on the phone you want to track, or you have that person’s consent to track them.
Tracking without consent is illegal in most countries.
 If you have a family plan with your cellular service provider, you may be able to enable tracking for the phones on that plan. This is especially useful if your children have phones on your plan and you want to keep tabs on them. Some of the major services include:


AT&T – FamilyMap $10/month
Sprint – Family Locator $5/month
T-Mobile – FamilyWhere $10/month
Verizon – Family Locator $10/month

, There are tracking apps that allow you to share your locations with other users in your network. This can be great for families with multiple smartphones that want to be able to keep tabs on each other. Each family member or friend will need to be signed up for the service and agree to share locations. Popular programs include:


Find My Friends

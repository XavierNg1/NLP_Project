 Garden vegetables that have already been sitting out for several days will lose some of their freshness, and freezing may cause them to lose additional flavor. To ensure that the vegetables stay fresh for as long as possible, choose vegetables that are just barely ripe or slightly unripe. Steer clear of overripe vegetables which may go bad even when frozen.


Harvest your vegetables early in the morning and begin the freezing process immediately for best results.;
, If you do use damaged garden vegetables, remove these damaged spots before beginning the process.
 Even if the garden they came from is organic and free of potentially harmful pesticides, they will still be covered in dirt and bacteria. If necessary, use a potato brush to gently scrub away any stuck-on grime.
 Remove any non-edible parts and chop the vegetables into your preferred size for eventual serving.

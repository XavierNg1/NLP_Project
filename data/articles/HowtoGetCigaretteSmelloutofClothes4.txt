 Some people prefer using wads of newspaper, coffee grounds in a fabric baggie, activated charcoal, or cedar chips, among others, in the bag-and-seal method. Try different combinations until you find what works best for you.
 You can also try using ammonia and/or Borax in the wash cycle. Follow product instructions, and be careful, especially if you have children around. These contain dangerous chemicals.

 If you have a lot of smoky clothes -- for instance, if you’ve just acquired a smoker’s wardrobe -- some people will recommend hanging them all in a room with an ozone generator machine, then closing the door for a couple days. (Always follow the instructions for the ozone generator.)


If you choose this method, please be very careful. Ozone is detrimental to your health, and there is scant scientific evidence for most of the cleaning/disinfecting claims made by ozone generator manufacturers. That said, there is some evidence that ozone generators may help eliminate secondhand smoke odors.

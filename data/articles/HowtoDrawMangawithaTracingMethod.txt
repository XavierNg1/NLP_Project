 You can get it online or maybe even through a book! It really doesn't matter how complex the picture is. But you don't want to get one with too many details if this is your first time tracing.;
, There are four steps of tracing manga. Place one of the tracing papers onto the printed picture. Label it Step 1. Try clipping it with a strong clip to a board. That will secure it to stay in the same place while you are tracing.
 When you have your first tracing paper in place and in line with the printed picture, start tracing shapes you see. For example, trace a circle for the head, and oval for the body and a bigger circle for a dress. Make sure your shapes line up with the picture or else you will have a crooked picture.
 Once you have the major basic shapes down, you have to do the other simple shapes. So start by tracing the major basic shapes onto another piece of paper. Once you have 3 or 4 major steps down on paper, put the 2nd tracing paper, which you would have labeled Step 2, on top of the printed picture. Then trace the simple shapes that are slightly more complex than the first 3-4 shapes. As an example, do circles as hands and long ovals as arms.
 Trace the simple shapes onto another piece of paper and start to draw the edges of the character. Just simplify the edges a little more. Label it step 3.
 Trace all the details along with all the 4 steps.
 Now just follow the steps to draw on a paper, and now you have your own!

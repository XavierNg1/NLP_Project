 The first one is Design. Here you have to emphasize what type of design you used: independent samples or repeated measures design. Give reasons for using such design: mention positive and negative sides of it. Don't forget to state independent and dependent variable. Also mention ethical guidelines: consent, briefing and debriefing.
 Here you should discuss your participants characteristics: what was the target population, what was their level of fluency in English, what are their cultural and social background (homogeneous or diverse), what was the sample, how was the sample chosen and why was it chosen in that manner.
 Here you simply give a list of the materials used, example:


Consent form (Appendix 1)
Set of instructions (Appendix 3)
Other material (Appendix *number where of the appendix under which the material is shown*)

, Here you have to be accurate, precise careful and most of all straight forward. Describe the room in which the experiment was conducted and its setting. And then explain procedure of experiment, step-by-step. Mention everything, from singing the consent form to instructions reading to debriefing to saying final words and letting them go.

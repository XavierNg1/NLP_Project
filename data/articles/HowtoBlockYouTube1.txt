 You can enable Safety Mode in YouTube, which will only allow access to all-ages videos. This is the best option if you want to be able to access YouTube yourself, and still want your children to be able to access useful and safe videos.If you want to block YouTube completely for everyone, see the next section.
The Restricted Mode filter is based on community flagging, and as such is not 100% perfect.;
, Make sure that you log into YouTube with a Google account that you child does not have access to. This will ensure that they are not able to turn Restricted Mode off on their own.
 You'll find the "Restricted Mode" menu here.
 You'll see the options appear beneath the menu.
 You'll be prompted to enter your Google account password again.
 This will lock Restricted Mode on for the browser.
 Restricted Mode only applies to the browser that you enabled it on, so you'll need to enable it on every browser that you have installed. The process is the same regardless of the browser., Most browsers allow you to enter an "incognito" mode that doesn't track browsing history. This mode will also bypass Restricted Mode in YouTube. You'll need to disable the incognito or private browsing option for each of your browsers.


See Turn Off Private or Incognito Browsing for instructions.
 If you have any devices with the YouTube app installed, you'll need to enable Restricted Mode on the app as well.


Open the YouTube app.
Tap the Menu button and select "Settings."
Select "General" and then check the "Restricted mode" box (Android), or tap "Restricted Mode Filtering" and select "Strict" (iOS).
 Mobile browsers on your smartphones and tablets have a Restricted mode as well.


Open your mobile browser and visit the YouTube website.
Tap the menu button in the upper-right corner and select "Settings."
Toggle "Restricted Mode" on.

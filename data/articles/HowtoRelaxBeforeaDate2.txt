 Another way to relax before a date is just to try to take your mind off of it. Fill your thoughts with other things. One way to do this is by watching some TV or a movie, or even just some videos on the internet.Watching something funny can be especially helpful, as laughter is thought to ease tension and reduce stress., A book is another great tool for occupying your mind. Pick a novel that will really hold your attention. You can pass a few hours this way and hardly even think about your date.Make sure to pick something that will really engage you. A book with a topic or writing style that doesn't keep you interested won't be of much help.
 Talking to a friend can be a great way to either distract you or calm you down. A conversation with a good friend can really keep your mind occupied. Reaching out to someone in your social network can also reduce stress.In addition to calming your nerves, you might also get some good last-minute advice for your date., A puzzle that makes your brain work is another good tool for taking your mind off your anxiety. Do a crossword, a sudoku puzzle, or any other kind of brain teaser that interests you.Try to pick a puzzle that's challenging enough to keep your mind from wandering, but not one that is so challenging that you get frustrated, as this can add to your anxiety.

 If you prefer to speed past your enemies without making contact, a machine with a high Boost but low body is the best for you. Try the Golden Fox. If you prefer to cause as much damage as possible, and THEN go for the victory, try the Fire Stingray or the Wild Goose, both of which have strong bodies. If you're just starting to play, use Captain Falcon's Blue Falcon. His machine is perfectly balanced. Literally.;
,, You might be really mad that someone as bad as Dr. Clash is in first place, but you can pass him on the second or third lap.
 Crashing people earns you energy and if you crash five machines you earn an extra life. Assuming you won, the people who are threatening your victory will be next to you. Dispatch your rival with a Spin Attack or a Side Attack as soon as possible. You won't be sorry.
 Once your Energy meter is full, Boost again. The Pits refill your Energy ridiculously quickly, so if you don't have anything to refill, you are wasting time.
 If you've passed everyone, don't Boost unless they are gaining. They will almost certainly pass you when you have no more Energy.
 You just have to make sure that your rival doesn't.
 F-Zero is a game, and if you lose, you can always try again.

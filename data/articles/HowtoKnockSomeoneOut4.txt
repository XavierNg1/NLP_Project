 This technique works especially well when your attacker comes from the side, but if your attacker is coming from a different angle, you will need to rotate your stance until your shoulder roughly lines up with the vertical center of your attacker's body.


Note that you can use either side of your body for this attack, but you may be able to apply more force if you turn your body so that your dominant side faces your attacker.
 Once your attacker comes toward you, take a step forward with the foot nearest him or her, causing your full body weight to shift forward onto that foot.


You need to step into your assailant's attack, not draw back from it.
This move only works if your attacker is on the offensive and actively coming toward you. It uses to force of the attacker's forward motion to inflict damage.
 Lift your elbow up as you step into your opponent's attack, causing the elbow to meet the inside of the Adam's apple on either side.


If you strike the inside of the Adam's apple from a 45 degree angle, you should be able to cause your attacker to to collapse.
Even if you do not successfully strike the pressure point, the force from the impact of your elbow should be enough to throw your attacker off.

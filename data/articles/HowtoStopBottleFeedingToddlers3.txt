 Look for a cup that has handles so that your child has an easier time holding it. The cup should be made of a lightweight material like plastic. The cup should have a lid so that spills are avoided (for the most part).


Look for a cup that is made of bright colors, or has a picture of your child’s favorite movie or book character on it. When the cup has something on it that your child likes, your child will be more inclined to use it.
 Try to drink from the cup before you give it to your child. If your child tries to drink out of it, only to find that the liquid doesn’t flow easily out of the cup, then she may become frustrated and ask for her bottle again., Introduce the cup with enthusiasm. Present it as a cool tool that big kids use to drink. Praise your child whenever she uses the cup, and tell her how impressed you are.


Consider rewarding your child when she uses the cup. Give her hugs, take her to the park, or reward her with a healthy snack. Do this only at the beginning when you are trying to help your child accept the cup as a habit. Over time, replace the reward with praise only.
 When your child is still drinking out of both a bottle and a cup, begin diluting the milk in the bottle so that the milk in the cup tastes better. Your child will most likely begin asking for the cup more often than the bottle.Give your child her favorite drinks in a cup, while only sticking to water or drinks she doesn’t like as much from the bottle.
 Children often copy what they see their parents doing. Pour milk into your own cup and show your child how you drink it. Offer a cup of milk to your child at the same time. Show your child how to lift the cup.Help your child by showing your child how to grasp the cup and lift it to her mouth.

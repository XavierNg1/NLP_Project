 You will need a large v-shaped carving knife, a standard carving knife, a cutting board, and a freshly washed radish. Choose a medium-sized radish with smooth, unbroken red skin. The tops of the radish should be green, not wilted, and the roots should be bright white., Use the standard carving knife to gently slice away the leaves in layers. Once the leaves are removed, you will see a pale red stalk. This stalk will help you pick up the radishes and hold them while carving., Press the v-shaped carving knife into the skin of the radish to make long, pointed cuts. This carving technique will create triangular leaves in the flesh of the radish. Work from the bottom of the radish to the top, alternating the rows for a realistic effect. Carve the petals about one centimeter deep into the flesh. If you carve too deeply, the “petals” won’t open.
 Fill a bowl with cold water and ice. Drop the radishes into the bowl and let them soak for an hour. This will open up the petals of the flower and give the radishes a realistic natural appearance.

 A gaming night is, after all, about gaming. You can still have a good time hanging out with your friends regardless of whether or not you're a gamer, but know that they're going to want to play. If you hate all things gaming, it might not be the party for you.
 You might want to bring along some books, some supplies for drawing, some music, or a device to surf the Internet. Whatever floats your boat, bring some entertainment and share it with your friends.
 If you're not super into gaming, you can take another role at the event. Make sure everyone has drinks and snacks, make sure everyone gets a turn, and generally be a good host.
 Okay, so you're not a gamer, but what if you just give it a go? Multiplayer games like racing can be really fun even if you don't know what you're doing. See if one of your friends is willing to teach you, and give it a go for a few minutes, even if you go back to another activity afterwards.

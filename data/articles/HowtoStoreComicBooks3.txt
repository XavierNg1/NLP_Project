It’ll be much easier for you to control the climate., A filing cabinet keep your bagged and backing boarded collection well-organized and protected from damage. If you have a filing cabinet with a lock, comic books stored inside will also be less likely to be stolen., These books should still be bagged and boarded, at minimum. Though if a comic is rare enough to be kept in a safety deposit box, you should really look into having that beauty certified and slabbed.

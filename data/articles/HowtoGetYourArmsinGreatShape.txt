 You can buy them, borrow them, or get a gym membership. By doing this, you can build weight in muscle. If you don't have access to weights, you can substitute them with 1.5 liter (0.4 US gal) bottles filled with water.;
, Try abdominal work with the weights, along with your triceps. The more muscle that you build in the arms, the heavier you will go in weights.
 Pumping iron more than three days a week can lead to overtraining, which is perhaps worse for your muscles than not lifting at all. If you are a beginner, you should focus on compound exercises like push ups and pull ups which work your triceps and biceps rather than isolating your arms (3 days a week). If you are an advanced bodybuilder, you may wish to perform an intense arm workout once or twice a week.
 Eat lots of fruits and vegetables throughout the day. Additionally, eat 0.75 - 1 gram of protein for every pound of bodyweight every day. (if you weigh 150 pounds, eat between 115 and 150 grams of protein every day).
 Your body needs sleep to replenish itself, not to mention to rebuild your muscles. Strive to go to sleep as early as you can, and try to wake up naturally. If you need to wake up at six every morning, go to sleep even earlier!

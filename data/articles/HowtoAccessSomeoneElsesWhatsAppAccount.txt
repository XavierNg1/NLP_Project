 The phone's screen should be facing you, while the camera should be facing the QR code on your computer.


If you've previously scanned a QR code with WhatsApp, you will need to first tap Scan QR Code near the bottom of the screen to invoke the camera.
 If the camera doesn't acknowledge the QR code right away, try moving your friend's phone closer to the screen. Once the QR code is scanned, the WhatsApp Web application will open; this is a program that allows you to view your friend's WhatsApp messages on your computer.


WhatsApp messages viewed in the Web app will update as your friend sends and receives new messages.

 Every router has a different method for accessing the settings. Most routers are accessible from a web browser by entering the IP address, typically 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.2.1.


If you cannot access your router with either of those IPs, visit PortFoward.org and enter your router’s information. The default guides will list the standard addresses used by your router.






Most routers require a username and password to access the configuration menu. This would be the username and password you set up when you installed the router on your computer.






Typically, the default username is “admin” and the default password is “password” or “admin”.
 This is typically listed under Advanced Options. It may go by another name, such as Virtual Servers, depending on the manufacturer.
 The Minecraft server port is 25565 by default. If your router wants a range of ports, enter 25565 into both the "Start Port" and "End Port."


Set "Protocol" to "TCP."







, Make sure the IP address matches your server’s IPv4 address. Check this in Windows by opening the command prompt in Windows and running “iponfig”. Your IP address will be listed next to “IPv4 Address.” You may have to scroll up to see it. If using a Mac, click the Apple menu and select System Preferences, and then Network. Your IP address will be listed in the lower-right part of the window.
 Review your settings to make sure everything is entered correctly.

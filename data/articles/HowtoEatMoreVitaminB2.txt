 If you want to focus on one vitamin, you can eat more of the foods listed above. Or, you can create a diet rich in all the B vitamins by eating a few foods that contain multiple B vitamins. A spinach salad that included hard-boiled eggs and sunflower seeds, for instance, would provide a high amount of every single B vitamin.
 These fish are a great low-fat source of protein, and they contain loads of B vitamins. A meal featuring salmon, in particular, provides high levels of 6 of the 8 B vitamins: B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, and B12. Trout has more B1, B2, B5, and B12 than almost any other food. Mackerel (B2, B3, and B12) and tuna (B3, B6, B12) are two more fish you can rotate into your diet., A quarter cup of sunflower seeds will give you 43% of your daily B1, 28% of your B6, 24% of your B5, 20% of your B9, 18% of your B3, and sunflower seeds are a good source of B7., Lean cuts of beef, pork, and lamb are very good sources of B vitamins. Red meat provides high levels of B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, and B12, while pork is rich in B1, B2, B3, B5, and B6. Chicken and turkey are less potent, but do contain large amounts of B3, B5, and B6., Spinach is rich in B2, B6, B7, and B9. Other leafy greens have smaller, but still significant amounts of B vitamins., Hard-boiled eggs are a great, portable snack, as well as a delicious salad topping. Try boiling several in advance and keeping them in the refrigerator for when you need them. They are rich in B2, B5, B7, and B12., Whole wheat bread is a great way to get more B1, B7, and B9. White breads tend to have very little B vitamins, though French bread is very rich in B9., It’s not just what you eat that determines your vitamin B levels. What you don’t consume matters, too. Drinking too much alcohol will interfere with your ability to absorb B3and B6., Caffeine interferes with the absorption of B1. In addition, it is a diuretic (it makes you pee more), which can lead to low levels of B vitamins because they are all water soluble.

 Hoof oil affects the ability of the hoof to absorb or evaporate moisture and must be used carefully.Applying it or any other compound unnecessarily can actually cause problems for your horse., If your horse’s hooves become too dry, they might become cracked or brittle. Hoof oil can alleviate these problems. In dry conditions, soak your horse’s feet and then apply a layer of hoof oil in order to help it better retain moisture., In wet conditions, hoof oil can help your horse’s hooves stay dry and prevent them from becoming too soft. Place your horse somewhere dry -- a dry stable, for instance -- until the hooves are fully dried. After applying a coat of hoof oil to the dried hooves, keep your horse stabled until the oil dries too.

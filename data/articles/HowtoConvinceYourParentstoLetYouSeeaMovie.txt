 Ratings are important, and the reasons for each rating. Also, find the date of the movie. A PG-rating in the 70's or 80's is different from a PG-rating now. That's why they came up with the rating "PG-13.";
, Go online and find reviews of the movie at parent sites. Sites are made specifically by parents, for parents, about the content of movies.
 Clean your room, help out around the house, be nice to your siblings, and don't throw a tantrum if you don't get your way.
 If the movie was a book first, read the book. You might want to discuss the book with your parents.
 Ask your friends' parents to talk to your parents about the movie. If they won't, tell your parents yourself.
, You could try to incorporate the movie (and thus see it) into a school project. For instance, you could read the book and then see the movie, to compare differences between film and literature representations. Or you could see the movie as an example of some kind of social problem. (Like how Fight Club deals with male aggression.)

,, Then comes Language, Drugs, and Violence in that order. So don't spend as much time covering language with your parents as sex and nudity!

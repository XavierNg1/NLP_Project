 Have smooth hair for this hairstyle, so condition your hair when you wash it, then brush it out before you start.
 Using a hair pick or pencil, separate the hair you will use to make the headband. You will need hair on both sides of your head but you start only on one side. Clip together the hair from the other side until you are ready.
 Tie back the rest of your hair with a band or clip. This should be the majority of the hair. br>

, Starting with the first section you separated, begin french plaiting using the basic method described in the section above. Move down towards the back of your neck, following the edge of your hair as you go.
 Once you reach the top of your neck, begin plaiting as normal. Tie the braid off after a few twists and move to complete the other side, repeating the process.
 Using a hair band, ribbon, clip or other styling choice, tie the hair off at the end, where the hairs become too short to fit in the plait.

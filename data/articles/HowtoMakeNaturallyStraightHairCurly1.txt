 A mid-length cut will make it far easier to curl your hair then a very short or very long cut. Your hair will be long enough to add some layers of curls but no so long as to make the whole process unbearable. Having your hair at about your shoulder is the perfect length.;
, Your hair needs to be moisturized if you want it to maintain the style. If you have let your hair get very dry then the curls will fall away much more quickly. Try to prepare for curling your hair a week or so ahead of time by using moisturizing shampoo products.
 Dove Daily Moisturizer Shampoo and Nexus Pro-Blend Bodifying Mousse are two highly recommended products. Use the moisturizing shampoo every other day for about a week before you try to curl your hair and save the mousse for the hair-curling day.

 Some restaurants keep track of the best options for diabetic diners, even if they are not officially noted on the menu.
 Because of the low-carb diet fads, many restaurants have symbols to identify menu options that are low in carbohydrates. These are often excellent selections for diabetics, but be sure to watch portion sizes and still ask for sauces and dressings on the side.
 Portion sizes can be the enemy of even the best-behaved diabetics. When you place your meal order, ask them to please bag half of your meal for take-home before they serve your meal.
 If you are unsure what is included in a dish or particular menu item, donâ€™t be afraid to ask. Inform the waiter or waitress that you are diabetic and you need to know whether the dish contains refined carbohydrates or other specific ingredients. Most staff will be happy to assist you.

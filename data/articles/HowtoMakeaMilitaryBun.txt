 Spend a good few minutes running a brush through your hair until it feels smooth and completely free of tangles. Make sure that this is the first thing you do -- if you brush your hair after you wash it, you'll be more likely to break your strands and damage your hair.

, You can use shampoo and conditioner if you need it, but the main purpose of washing your hair is to get it wet, though cleaning it is an added bonus.
 Dry your hair with a towel and wring it out until it's nice and damp. If it's soaking wet, it will be hard to make a bun, but you won't be able to do it if your hair is completely dry, so don't blow dry it or wait to long before you make your bun.
 Put a dime-sized amount of hair gel onto the comb and run it through your hair.
 Secure it with a thick ponytail holder that you wrap at least 3-4 times around your hair. The ponytail should be very tight and close to your scalp.
 In case the first one breaks or loses its elasticity, you'll be prepared.
 Hold it up as you twist the ponytail tightly.
 Starting at the base of the ponytail, take the twisted ponytail and wrap it around itself as much as you need to until it is completely wrapped. Make sure there are no loose strands and that your hair is neatly wrapped without bumps.
 Start securing the hair at the top of the bun, pushing the pins down to secure the bun to the rest of your hair. Try moving your head around -- if the bun doesn't feel completely secure and in place, try using a few more bobby pins until you can move your head in all directions without the bun going out of place.
 For an additional touch, you can place a hairnet over the bun, doubling it two or three times depending on the size of the bun.
 Use at least 2-3 small pins to secure the hairnet in place.
 Smooth any flyaways with a little gel. Keep the hairspray with you throughout the day just in case you need to secure your look later.

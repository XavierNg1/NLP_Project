 Paper plates and card stock are the easiest materials to work with to make your mask. Cut out an oval shape in the material that mimics the shape of your face. Draw your design onto the material, and use a scissors to cut out the eyes and the mouth. Before drawing on the eyes and mouth, put the mask up to your face. With a pencil, make a mark where your eyes and mouth fall. Then draw the eyes and mouth over these marks and cut them out.
 You can also use paper mâché to build the mask around a balloon. First inflate a regular sized balloon and tie it. Take a couple strips of newspaper and dip them into the bowl of decoupage glue. Then stick them onto the balloon. Do this until you have two or three layers of newspaper in roughly the shape of a mask.Leave the paper mâché for a couple hours to let it dry. One it has dried, poke the balloon with a pin or other sharp object. Then peel the balloon away so you are left with just the mask.
Cut out the eyes and the mouth. Use a scissors to cut out the eye and mouth holes. If you cannot cut through the paper mâché with scissors, use an Exacto-knife to cut out the holes.
 By using plaster, you can mold the mask to your face so it fits perfectly. Before starting the mask, apply a layer of Vaseline around the edge of your face near your hairline, as well as over your eyebrows. Put small squares of dampened paper towel over your eyes. Then lie down and have a friend start layering on the plaster bandages by dipping them in water and putting them directly on your face. They should lay down around three layers of bandages.Make sure you friend keeps the eye and the mouth area open.
Peel off the mask and wash your face to get rid of any Vaseline or plaster.

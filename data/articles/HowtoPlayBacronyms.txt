 It is assumed that you are familiar with acronyms. In acronyms, you normally pick the initial letters of the name of an institution, enterprise etc., and form a word, which may have no meaning taken by itself. A bacronym, on the other hand, is a novel concept, not yet a dictionary word. Here is how to create a bacronym:


Form a phrase using only the letters of the word itself (no more, no less) in their sequential order, so that the phrase yields one of the dictionary meanings of the word or its common usage. For example:

Have you ever thought of Ear - as the Earliest Audio Receiver?
Or, Easy - as Effortless And Simple, Yes.
And New - as Not Ever Witnessed or Never Ever Witnessed.

;
, See how many you can make:


Open the dictionary to any page you like.
Select a section of words.
Work through them methodically to create amazing bacronyms.
 Play games with words you've already chosen in advance and set time limits. People can play individually or in teams. And award prizes for the best bacronyms, based on everyone's consensus.
 These can be given in quiz form, for example:


Stomach - Sensitive, Turbulent Organ, M........ Activity Conducted Here. (Metabolism)
Tableau - Theatrical And Beautiful Looking Exposition A......... U...... (Arranged Uncannily).

 It may be harder for you, but there are still ways to help others. You can play freerice.com (a game that gives rice to people who need it); switch your search engine to something like benelab.org (which donates all proceeds to charity); have a bake/lemonade/garage sale for a charity of your choice; or help your parents around the house.


For over 14. It is easier for you, because in addition to doing the steps for under-14s, you can volunteer at a hospital, or other charity. You can also help little siblings, or write/edit articles on WikiHow.
 Get to know new people, and talk to people you meet. Make friends with that other boy at the supermarket while your parents shop, or the kid in your science class you don't know.
 You don't have to be a health nut; you can eat fast-food and ice cream once in a while. Just exercise and eat mostly healthy foods.
 Try doing something that you have never done before. It can be as simple as a new sport, or it could be as adventurous as skydiving. It can be as old as knitting (which is not just a skill for grandmas, kids can do it too), or as recently invented as Photoshop. Find something you have never done before, that you love.
 Whether you like video games, watching TV, reading, or making home movies, don't spend all your time exercising, volunteering, and helping at home. Just don't spend all of your time watching TV either.

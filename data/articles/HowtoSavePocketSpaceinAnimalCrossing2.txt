 Do this by tapping the pink envelope button on the bottom of the screen.

Letters are given their own inventory slot, which consists of 10 spaces.
 When you open the envelop inventory, your item inventory will also be displayed. Select the item to add to the letter with the stylus/wii remote., Once the item is dragged over, it will turn into a present box, so make sure you remember where you put each item.

Only one item can be put into a letter.
You cannot drag an item to an empty letter slot. If you need more letters, simply wait for either Nintendo or your mother to send some, or send out letters to villagers in hopes of getting replies

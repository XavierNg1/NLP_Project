 In this case, the path is circular.
, Each vector has a direction.

 The velocity vector of the charged particle is always tangential to the path of the charged particle.  





 In this case, magnetic field vector has only two possible directions; into the page and out of the page. 





 Force vector is always pointed towards the center of curvature of the circular path.  





 At least two vector directions need to be known in order to find the other. In this case, the directions of velocity vector (v{\displaystyle v}) and force vector (F{\displaystyle F}) are given and magnetic field vector (B{\displaystyle B}) is to be determined.


 Situate your right hand as illustrated in the picture. Thumb finger corresponds to the velocity vector, index finger corresponds to magnetic field vector, and middle finger corresponds to force vector.
 After determining the whether the direction of magnetic field vector is either into the page or out of the page, it is time to look at the charge of the particle.

 If the particle has a positive charge, keep the direction of the magnetic field vector as is.

 If the particle has a negative charge, reverse the direction of the magnetic filed vector.

 If the direction of the magnetic filed vector is pointing into the page, reverse it to be out of the page.

 If the direction of the magnetic filed vector is pointing out of the page, reverse it to be into the page.

 You will need to multiply your height in meters by itself first. For example, if you are 1.75 meters tall, then you would multiply 1.75 by 1.75 and get a result of approximately 3.06., Next, you will need to divide your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared. For example, if your weight is 75 kilograms and your height in meters squared is 3.06, then you would divide 75 by 3.06 for an answer of 24.5 as your BMI., You can still calculate your BMI if your height is in centimeters, but you will need to use a slightly different equation to do so. This equation is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in centimeters, then divided again by your height in centimeters, and then multiplied by 10,000.For example, if your weight in kilograms is 60 and your height in centimeters is 152, then you would divide 60 by 152, by 152 (60 / 152 / 152) for an answer of 0.002596. Multiply this number by 10,000 and you get 25.96 or about 26. The approximate BMI for this person would be 26.
Another option is to simply change your height in centimeters to meters by moving the decimal two places to the left. For example, 152 centimeters equals 1.52 meters. Then, find your BMI by squaring your height in meters and then dividing your weight by your height in meters squared. For example, 1.52 multiplied by 1.52 equals 2.31. If you weigh 80 kilograms, then you would divide 80 by 2.31 and your result would be a BMI of 34.6.

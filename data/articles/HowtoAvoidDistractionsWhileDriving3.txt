 Try to avoid driving with too many passengers, especially if you are a new driver. Loud or talkative passengers can be a distraction in and of themselves. So try to drive with only one or two people at a time.For young drivers, the risk of being in a crash triples when they are driving with passengers who are their peers versus driving alone., When you do have someone in the car with you, let them control the music, GPS, and the climate controls. You can also let them answer your texts or phone calls while you are driving. This will not only help you focus on the road, but it will also give your passengers something to do instead of distracting you. Let your passengers know ahead of time what their role is while you drive.For example, “Ok, Kevin, since you are in the passenger’s seat, your main job is to adjust the controls and GPS, as well as answer texts and calls so I can focus on driving.”

, Serious or stressful conversations can get emotional. When your emotions are running high, it is more difficult to focus on the task at hand, in this case driving. Let your passenger know that you would like to talk, but that you would rather do it later when you are not driving. This way you can focus on driving, and give the conversation your full attention when the time is right.You can say for example, “I would like to talk about this with you, but right now is not a good time since I am driving. Let’s wait until we arrive at our destination to talk.”
If things start to get heated, then pull the car over in a safe place to diffuse the situation.

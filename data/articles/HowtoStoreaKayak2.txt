 This will allow the kayak to balance evenly. Make sure there is a wall that it can lean against. It is best to store a kayak somewhere indoors. This will protect it from the elements outside.A garage, basement, or shed are great places to store a kayak.
 Tilt the kayak so that it is horizontal and rest it against a wall with its cockpit facing out. It should be resting on its side, not flat. It will rest against the wall at an angle.The side of a kayak is one of the strongest parts, so it will not dent easily. But over an entire season, depending on what your kayak is made of (for example, plastic dents easily), it could begin to dent. To avoid this, flip it onto its other side once a month.
 Instead of resting it horizontally, turn it vertically and rest it against a wall with its cockpit facing out. To keep it in place while standing up, it should be at a slight angle. You should also store it so that its stern is touching the ground and its bow is up towards the ceiling.To protect your kayak and help it to stay in place, put some padding underneath it. You could place a few towels or cushions inside a small crate and place the end of the kayak inside.
To keep your kayak in place, you can install a couple of support pegs on the outer edge of each side of the top of the kayak., For a short amount of time, it will be ok, but storing it flat, whether face-up or face-down, puts significant stress on the kayak. Because of this, it is best to avoid storing it flat on the ground whenever possible.This includes hanging the kayak from the ceiling. Hoists can conveniently get kayaks out of the way, but they are not very secure, and since the kayak has to lay flat, significant stress is placed on the kayak. Therefore, it is better to mount it on a wall.

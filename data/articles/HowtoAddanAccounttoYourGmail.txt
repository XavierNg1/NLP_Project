 Just open a browser on your computer, and go to www.gmail.com to get to the Gmail website. Log into your account with your for-work or for-play e-mail address and the respective password to bring you to your Gmail Inbox.;
, When the drop-down menu appears, select “Settings” from the list of options to continue.
 This double-checking is a safety precaution for your account to make sure it is really you making these significant changes. Just enter your password as prompted, and click on “Sign In” to continue.
 Across the top of this new page, however, are different categories of settings. Click on “Accounts and Import” (the fourth option) to open up new settings.
 Once the new list of settings have loaded, about halfway down the page, look for the setting that reads “Grant access to your account.” It will be followed by the “Add another account” link, which you must click on.
 The new screen that pops up as a result of the previous step will ask for the Gmail address you want to add to this particular account of yours. Just click on the box and type in the e-mail address to your other account. Once you’ve done that, click on the “Next Step” tab.
 After previously clicking on “Next Step,” at the top of the next window, you will be asked the question “Are you sure?” This is simply to prompt you to review that the information you entered is correct. Be very sure that it is before clicking on “Send e-mail to grant access,” or you might grant access to someone else.
 After adding your for-play account to your for-work account (or vice versa), all you need to do is to confirm the addition by signing into your other Gmail account (the one that got added.) Once there, check your inbox for an e-mail that should contain a link to confirm your new addition. Click on that link, and you’re done.

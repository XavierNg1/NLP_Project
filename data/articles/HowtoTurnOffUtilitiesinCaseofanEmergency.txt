 If your property is burning, do not enter the building to turn off the electric if you are risking being overcome by smoke or fire. If a gas line bursts or is leaking, remaining inside could be more dangerous than leaving the gas on. You also may be able to turn the gas off out doors at a gas storage tank or meter.

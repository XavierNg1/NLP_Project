 Instructions on how to begin will appear on-screen asking you to create your first building.;
, Click this. The Building menu will appear in place of the Neighbors list, and a list of the houses you have unlocked so far (at the beginning of the game there is only one).
 (Note: The house must be connected to a road or a path.) The price of the house in CityVille coins will be deducted automatically. The house will appear unbuilt. To build the house, click on the building and one energy will be deducted for building. Depending on the building, this step may need to be repeated.


Your new villagers will move in and you will earn City Coins and XP (experience) for building a new house.

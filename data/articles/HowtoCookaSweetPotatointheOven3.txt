 Prepare a baking sheet by spraying it with nonstick cooking spray.


If desired, you could coat grease the baking sheet with a little oil or cover it with a sheet of nonstick aluminum foil instead of using the cooking spray.
 Use a sharp knife to cut each sweet potato into 1-inch (2.5-cm) slices, and then cut each slice into 8 or 9 cubes.


The cubes should have sides that are roughly even in size, and each cube should be about the same size as the other cubes. The pieces need to be similarly sized so that they cook within approximately the same time frame.
 Place the sweet potato cubes in a large mixing bowl and drizzle the oil over them. Add the salt, pepper, and paprika (or cayenne pepper). Toss gently to coat the potatoes evenly.


The oil helps the spices stick to the sides of the sweet potato cubes. If the cubes still seem “dry” and the spices are not sticking well, you might need to try slowly adding a little more oil, adding no more than 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) at a time.
 Place the seasoned sweet potato cubes on your prepared baking sheet and spread them out into an even, single layer.
 When done, the edges should be golden brown and the centers should be tender and flavorful.


Use a spatula to turn the cubes after the first 30 minutes. Doing so will promote even cooking and even browning.
After the 20-minute mark, you should check on the sweet potatoes every 5 minutes or so. They can overcook and burn quickly, so if the edges start to look a little too dark before the full time is up, you will need to remove them from the oven early.
 Transfer the sweet potato chunks to a warmed serving dish and enjoy while still fresh and hot.

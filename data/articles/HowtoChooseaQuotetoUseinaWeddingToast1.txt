 Quotes often appear at the beginning of a toast. If you choose this route, find something that will easily flow into the rest of your toast. Don't quote a famous poem just because the couple likes the poet. Use a quote that introduces the more personal content of your toast.You could open your toast by saying something like:


The playwright Sophocles once said, “One word frees us all from the weight and pain of life. That word is love.” Billy met Jane a few weeks after losing his dad. Almost overnight, the grief that had weighed him down started to vanish.;
, Narrow a poem or a song down to a line or two. If your heart is set on a long quote from a novel or movie, leave out unnecessary words and sentences. Place an ellipsis (three periods) between two words or sentences that don't appear right next to each other in the quote.For example, if you wanted to use a long quote from a TV show, you could say:


In an episode of “Friends,” Phoebe tells Ross that Rachel is his lobster. When he gets confused, she explains, “...lobsters fall in love and mate for life. …You can actually see old lobster couples walking around their tank...holding claws.”

, When you hit the search engine, you'll find tons of quotes standing on their own. If you're drawn to something that's brand new to you, research it more thoroughly to make sure it's not an expression of sarcasm or irony. This way, you won't ruin the moment when you're making your toast., A good quote or two can help drive home the point you're trying to make. However, the toast is really about what you have to say, as opposed to what the original speaker said. Keep your toast original by choosing no more than two quotes.

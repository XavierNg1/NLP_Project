 It's found at Route 8 during the daytime and nighttime, and the bottom of Wela Volcano Park at any time of the day. You have a 20% chance of finding it at Route 8, and a 30% chance of finding it at Wela Volcano Park. You'll find it at anywhere from level 16 to level 20.;
, Only female Salandit are able to evolve; male Salandit will not evolve at all. This can be difficult, since Salandit has only a 12.5% of being female. The easiest way to find one is to use a male Pokémon with the ability Cute Charm at the lead of your party. Cute Charm makes it easier to find a Pokémon of the opposite gender. Sylveon is a good Pokémon for this, since most Eevee are male, and Sylveon gets Cute Charm as its regular ability.
 Since Salandit is a Poison/Fire-type Pokémon, the best Pokémon to face are Grass, Bug, Ice, Steel, and Fairy-type Pokémon.

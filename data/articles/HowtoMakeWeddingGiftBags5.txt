 These can range from small to large in size. Use either a drawstring or ribbon to close the top with. For the fabric, try to match it to the wedding theme colors. Textures for the fabric could include muslin, lace, taffeta, organza, silk, etc.
 You can leave the sachet plain but if it seems too plain, add things such as a line of lace or ribbon, a line of pearl beads, some artificial flowers, a logo, etc.
 If small, there may only be room for a slice of cake; be sure to place this inside a proper cake bag first. For larger sachets, add trinkets, small food treats and other such gifts.

 The diameter of a circular object is the distance in a straight line from one edge to the other, passing through the center. For most tablecloths, you can simply estimate where the center is by eye. If you want to be more exact, you may measure starting at several positions and calculate the average of your results. The more exact method is recommended if you want a tablecloth that sits entirely on top of the table, with 0 to 2 inches (5 centimeters) of overhang.









This method may also be used for hexagonal tables or tables with other unusual shapes, as long as each edge of the table is of equal size.
 For most purposes, an overhang or "drop length" of at least 6 inches (15cm) is appropriate. A shorter drop length may make the tablecloth look too small for the table.For more formal occasions or tables that do not have chairs stored under them, you may choose to have a drop length extending all the way to the ground.









Measure the height difference between the chairs and the table to find out the maximum drop length that avoids piles of cloth gathering on the chairs when they are pushed in.
 Multiply your desired overhang or drop length by two to account for the fact that the cloth needs to hang over either side of the table. Add this result to the diameter you measured for the table to get the ideal diameter for your table.
 If you cannot find a tablecloth with that exact diameter, and you do not wish to make your own round tablecloth, try to find one that's a couple inches (or a few centimeters) larger, since that is less likely to cause noticeable problems than a smaller tablecloth.









You may also hang a square tablecloth on a round table. Either follow the manufacturer's recommended size for a round table with your table's diameter, or calculate the diagonal length of the square. This length should be equal to the ideal diameter you calculated above, or slightly larger.

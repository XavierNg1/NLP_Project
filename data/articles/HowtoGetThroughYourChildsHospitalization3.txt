 You may be trying to keep a strong demeanor in front of your child, but you are likely experiencing a range of emotions. It’s unhealthy to keep all those feelings under lock and key. Turn to someone you trust for a listening ear and needed support.

This might be a best friend, a sibling, a parent, or your spouse. You might say something along the lines of, “I could really use someone to talk to who’s not a medical professional. Do you mind?”

, Other obligations still need handling despite the stress of your child’s hospitalization. If you have other children, make arrangements with neighbors, family, or friends so that you won’t have to run back and forth from the hospital for school drop-offs and pickups.You might also need someone to prepare meals and snacks for your other children, or bring you meals at the hospital.
 Your other children may struggle with the disruption to their normal routine, or with missing their sibling. Alert their teachers to the situation so they can be on the lookout for any crying outbursts or other abnormal behavior.It’s common to inform the sick child’s teacher, but other kids may have to miss school or fall behind on assignments due to a sibling's hospitalization, too.

 You can use third-party programs to emulate a LAN (Local Area Network) game. This means that you won’t be connecting to that game’s servers when you play. Most of these services require that you register an account, and some offer paid subscriptions for more options.;
, There are several options available when it comes to online LAN options. The two most popular options are Garena+ and GameRanger. Both are free with options to pay a yearly fee for no ads and more support. Both programs support Warcraft III and its expansion packs.
 You will need to open specific ports in order to use these programs, which could pose a security risk. You may also run into more hackers and cheaters, as accounts that have been banned for cheating on Battle.net can access these programs without restriction.

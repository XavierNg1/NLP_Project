 Once boundaries have been set, you have to respect them. You cannot expect your parent(s) to respect your space and boundaries if you cannot do the same for them. If you are having trouble with the boundaries set, discuss it openly with your parents and seek a resolution.When a problem arises in your relationship with your parents, using team-building speech may be helpful.Try saying something like, “I respect your boundaries, but I feel like you might not always respect mine. What can we do to ensure that both of our needs are being met?”

, If your parent(s) are violating your boundaries, you have to let them know. This does not mean you need to be angry or upset. Calmly and respectfully inform your parent(s) that they are crossing the line and ask that it stop. If they are serious about respecting you, they will give you your space.Using humorous language can also be an effective way to deal with controlling people.For example, if your parent is constantly criticizing your career choice, then try making a joke about it by saying something like, “Note to self. Career does not please mother. Got it. Anything else?”

, If things begin to go “right back to normal,” you may need to cut down on your time with your parents again. This does not have to mean cutting off all ties to your parent(s). It often just means that things have gotten too close for them (or you) to follow through with the boundaries that both sides agreed to. Spend a little more time apart, and try again later., In some situations, the problems might be so severe that you will need to see a counselor with your parents to see any improvement. If you have tried to maintain boundaries and it is just not working, then talk to your parents about the possibility of seeing a therapist together.


Try saying something like, “Our relationship is important to me, but I think we might need some help to have the best relationship possible. Would you be willing to see a therapist with me?”

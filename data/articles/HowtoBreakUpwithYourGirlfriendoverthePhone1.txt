”I think you’re a great person.”
”I’ve been so lucky to have you in my life.”
”We've grown so much together.”

, No matter what it is, there needs to be a concrete reason for the breakup. Without a definite cause, there is a probable argument or a drawn out conversation. Any one of the following possibilities is a great reason to provide. ”You were caught cheating, and I just don’t believe I can ever forgive you.”
”We simply argue too much. The relationship isn’t fun anymore.”
”You’re mean to me, and I’m just not happy.”
”The communication in our relationship is a one-way street. You never listen.”

, Do not preface the sentence with “I think” or “I believe.” Do not use a substitute like, “I think we need space.” Be very blunt. It’s important to get your point across without any interpretation, debate, or argument that will bring about doubt.

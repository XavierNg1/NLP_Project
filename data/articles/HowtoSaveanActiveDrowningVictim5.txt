 Make sure someone has called 911 and check the ABCs. Determine if the person is breathing in and out, and if anything is obstructing his or her airway. If the person is not breathing, feel for a pulse on the wrist or the side of the neck. The pulse should be checked for 10 seconds., If the person has no pulse, begin performing CPR. For adults and children, place the heel of one hand hand on the center of the chest or place one hand on top of the other. Perform 30 chest compressions at the rate of 100 per minute. Press down about 2 inches. Allow the chest to rise completely between pushes. Check to see if the person has started breathing.Do not press on the victim's ribs.
If the victim is an infant, 2 fingers should be placed on the breastbone. Press down about 1.5 inches.
 Only give breaths if you are trained in CPR. Begin by tilting the head back and lifting the person's chin. Pinch the nose, cover the victim's mouth with yours, and give 2, one second breaths. Watch to make sure the chest is rising. Follow the 2 breaths with 30 chest compressions.Continue this cycle until the person begins breathing or professional emergency help arrives.

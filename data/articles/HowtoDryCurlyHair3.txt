 Drying mid-to-long curly hair with heat will typically take 30 minutes, if not much longer. If you don’t have this time, the best choice in many cases is to set and wrap your hair before you go to sleep. While your hair is still damp, not wet or dry, wind 1-2” sections toward your scalp and secure each with bobby pins. Then wrap your hair in a silk scarf to reduce flyaways. When you get up, use your fingers or a wide-toothed comb to unravel your curls and style.


If your hair is particularly curly, you can also twist or braid your hair before wrapping it., The idea behind plopping is that it not only reduces how long it takes your hair to dry but it also helps create a more polished curly look. Because your curls will stack on top of each other through plopping, they will have more spring and shape, and you’ll get more volume at your roots. Wash, condition and apply an anti-frizz or curling product to your hair first. Then follow these steps.


Lay a large t-shirt on a flat surface with the short sleeves closest to you.
Bend over and place your head in the center so your hair is lying above it on the t-shirt, and fold the end of the t-shirt over your hair and top of your head.
Grab the sleeves and twist inward toward your ears. Tie it (or secure with a clip) loosely at the base of your neck.
Leave it on for about 15-30 minutes and allow your hair to air dry the rest of the way., A bonnet dryer is a plastic cap that you wrap around your hair to dry it. It’s a more gentle method of drying hair than using a blow dryer, though it takes longer. Nonetheless, it will also speed up your total drying time if you don’t want to use a blow dryer because of its damaging effects.Hooded dryers are another less-damaging alternative.They aren’t as expensive as you might think; however, make sure you get one that is large enough to accommodate your head in rollers.


Both are hands-free, too, which is an advantage.

 Remove and wash the leaves. Place them in the freezer to freeze. Layer them on a baking sheet before placing in the freezer.
 Allow to thaw.
 Place on a large baking tray or dish. Line this with an equally large piece of parchment paper. You will be placing the thawed leaves onto the parchment paper sitting on top of the foil.


Both the foil and the parchment need to be long; you will be picking up the edges to wrap over the finished cabbage ball, so leave plenty of room for movement.
 Place the leaves crisscross from one another.
 The filling could be hamburger mince with cooked rice (brown or white), some spices and seasonings, garlic and an egg to bind it all together. A vegetarian version could be made using mince analog, a grain, mashed beans or hydrated TVP in place of the hamburger mince (egg optional).
 Add the filling after each layer of leaves. When all of the leaves from the entire cabbage have been used and the stuffing is in each layer, the ball is completed.
 The aim is to create a large boil; don't be surprised at the large shape––this can easily be as large as a basketball.
 Bake at 350ºF/180ºC for about 1 and 1/2 hours. Check to see how it is baking now and then; wear oven mitts as it will be hot to hold.
, Place on a serving plate and add to a buffet or potluck table. Provide a knife for cutting slices; the idea is to cut large layers in a circle, just like a round cake. At least 12 large slices will be available.

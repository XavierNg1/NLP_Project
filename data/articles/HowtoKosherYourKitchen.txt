, Use disposable utensils until you make your kitchen kosher.
, Immerse them in the mikvah, a ritual cleansing pool of rainwater. Vessels made of material other than glass or metal need not be immersed. If you don't live near a mikvah, make sure you have kosher soap.


Use steel wool or acetone to remove marks or labels from vessels before immersion.
 Clean parts and surfaces with chemical cleansers to remove food and grease, then reassemble the oven. Self-cleaning ovens are automatically kosher if you follow the manufacturer's directions.


Don't assume self-cleaning ovens are kosher. Set the oven at 450 Degrees Fahrenheit (232 Degrees Celsius) and leave it on for several hours. Clean spots that aren't removed by the continuous-clean process, but don't use caustic cleansers because they may destroy the oven's automatic-cleaning mechanism.
 If you don't have a blowtorch, purchase a new broiler pan.
 Electric range tops may not disassemble as easily, but turning the burners on high for a few minutes will kosher them. Thereafter take care not to set pots or utensils on surfaces you haven't koshered.
, Wait 24 hours, then boil the cutlery and utensils in water. If an item is too large for your pot, boil one end, then the other. Remove utensils with tongs and immerse the utensils in cold water.
 If necessary, submerge large pots in stages.
 It isn't possible to kosher a frying pan if oil was not used in the frying. The pan must be discarded.
 It isn't possible to kosher a porcelain sink because it's too porous.
 Keep separate scouring pads, sponges, tablecloths and napkins. To keep track of which is meat and which is dairy, use a different color for each.
, If you use one stove, dedicate certain burners to meat and certain to dairy and don't deviate.
 Otherwise, never cook meat and dairy simultaneously. Cover vessels tightly when baking. Wait 24 hours before cooking meat after baking something that will be served with dairy or vice versa.

 If you cut a hole in the resonant (front) head, this can help you make your bass drum sound a bit little less warm and resonant. Most importantly, it helps place microphones nice and close to the kick drum fir recording. Some considerations with a porthole include:


Keep the hole between 3"-5" in diameter.
Place the hole near the edge of the drum -- 3:00 or 5:00 position is best.
Consider testing drums with and without holes before you start cutting., Damping is placing a towel or pillow in the kick drum to absorb some of the vibrations. You can also buy dedicated products for damping, or tape a towel to the rim of the front head for a smaller effect. Damping has several benefits, but you should always test the sound out before committing to a damping strategy. Some effects of damping include:


Slightly quieter head and sound
Less resonance, leading to a punchier strike
More tone control -- move the damper to different parts of the kick drum for different sounds., Loosen up the bolts on the batter head if you want an even deeper, lower frequency sound. The looser the head, the deeper the sound. Loosening the resonant head can help as well, but it can also muddy up your sound if loosened too much.


Note, however, that looser heads create more resonance. Many drummers use some damping to control these effects.
 Drum tuning doesn't have a melodic key you need to hit. It is more about your personal sound than any "right" amount of tuning. Keep mixing and matching tightness, damping, portholes, and even the type of beaters you use to hit the drum to find your personal bass drum tone.


Sometimes the right tuning depends on the style of music. Pop and rock tends to like sharp but deep kick drums, whereas jazz drummers may be a bit more "splashy."

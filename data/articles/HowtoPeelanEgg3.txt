 When the eggs are done cooking, pour off the boiling water and refill the pot with cold water. Leave the eggs to cool.
 Pour off the cold water and cover the saucepan with a snug fitting lid. Hold the lid in place and shake the saucepan vigorously.
 When you open the lid of the saucepan, the egg shells will be broken into many pieces. Then you can simply rinse the broken shells off the eggs. This is a very quick and easy method of removing the shells, but may result in damaged eggs.

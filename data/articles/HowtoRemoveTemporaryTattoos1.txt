 Keep in mind that most temporary tattoos are able to stand up to water and soap, so oil is generally the best way to go if you want to scrub a temporary tattoo off. You could also try to use a face or body scrub. The beads from the scrub should help remove the tattoo from your skin.









Alternatively, you can use special temporary tattoo remover wipes like Limisan. Those wipes contain silicons which ensure easy removal of the temporary tattoo.
Alternatively, you can pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol onto a cotton ball or piece of paper towel. Be aware that rubbing alcohol may burn a bit.If you do not have baby oil, you can use olive oil on your tattoo as well.;
, Doing this will allow the baby oil to soak into the tattoo (and your skin) making it easier to rub the temporary tattoo away., The tattoo should begin to become clumpy and start to peel off and rub away. Keep rubbing until all of the temporary tattoo has been removed.









You can use a paper towel in place of a washcloth.
 Wash your skin until there is no oil left. Pat the area dry with a towel.

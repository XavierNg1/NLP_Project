 To begin making your nasal rinse, make sure you have a container that will be suitable for mixing and storage.


This container should not contain any dangerous plastics, or be a non-reusable container.
Glass or BPA-free plastic are both good container materials to consider.
Always remember to wash your hands before and after creating your nasal rinse. This will avoid cross contamination and the introduction of microorganisms or viruses.;
, Take a measuring spoon and look for the spoon with ½ teaspoon indicator.


Get the container with the pickling salt, and dip your measuring spoon inside the container.
You will get more than a ½ teaspoon of salt, so make sure to use a knife to level off the measuring spoon.
This will give you an exact measurement of the salt.
Repeat this process to measure out a ½ teaspoon of baking soda.
Set aside your salt and baking soda.
 Begin creating your nasal rinse.


Put your measured salt into the boiled or distilled water.
Stir the mixture until the salt and baking soda have dissolved, or until the water is clear.
Wait until the solution cools to a lukewarm temperature before using it.
A homemade nasal rinse can be stored for 3 days at room temperature.

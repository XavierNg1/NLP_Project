 The Xbox 360 can easily access the Internet wirelessly in an instant! It has a built in Wi-Fi adapter that allows it to connect to your router automatically.
 The first time you turn on your console, it will not yet automatically connect to the Internet, since it hasn’t memorized your router’s access information yet.
 In the Network menu, Xbox 360 will display all the Wi-Fi hotspots within its signal’s reach. Once the Xbox 360 detects your router in the Network, select it and you will be able to access the Internet. You may have to enter your router’s password first, depending on your router’s security settings. Xbox 360 will now remember this wireless setup and use it automatically on your following sessions.


If you have an Ethernet cable connected to your console, it will automatically go into “wired” Internet connection mode. If you want to stay connected wirelessly just disconnect the Ethernet cable from your unit.
You may need to adjust your console’s wireless configuration setting if your console fails to connect to the Internet. When in doubt, set everything to automatic or simply reset to default.

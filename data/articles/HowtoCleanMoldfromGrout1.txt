 Fill a bucket or spray bottle with warm water. Douse small sections of grout at a time., Use a narrow scrub brush, tile brush, or stiff toothbrush.If you’re having trouble getting into corners or grout lines with your brush, try using a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser for those areas.Instead of a scrub brush, you can try a closed-loop microfiber cloth. If so, wear gloves to protect your hands from the friction.
 If water alone doesn’t work, mix three parts baking soda with one part water to form a paste.Apply the paste to the grout, and let it sit for one to two hours. Spray with plain water, then scrub the grout again.Alternately, make a paste from two parts baking soda to one part hydrogen peroxide. Let the paste sit on the grout for several minutes before scrubbing it and rinsing it clean.
 Use clean running water, a spray bottle or a clean, wet sponge to rinse the grout.
 Use clean cloths to buff remaining moisture from the grout. Open a window or turn on a fan until the grout is dry to the touch.

 Weight loss can occur and can continue for some time. Thirty to fifty percent of people who suffer a significant infection will develop pneumonia. A large number of those infected will have abnormal results on liver function tests. Some will develop hepatitis.
 Treatment should be started within 3 days of the first signs of infection. Generally treatment lasts 2-3 weeks. Most patients will recover within 2-3 months without any treatment. However, if the infection lasts for more than 6 months (a rare occurrence among well persons), the chronic form of the disease may develop.

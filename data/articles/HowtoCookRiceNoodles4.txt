Rice noodles are a key feature of Pad Thai, a specific type of stir-fry commonly consisting of eggs, fish sauce, red chili pepper, tamarind juice, and other protein and vegetable ingredients.
If adding the rice noodles to the stir-fry as it cooks, do so during the last few minutes and only partially cook the noodles beforehand.
If pouring the stir-fry ingredients over rice noodles after you finish cooking everything, use fully cooked noodles.
If using fresh noodles instead of dried, add them directly to the stir-fry during the last few minutes without previously soaking or cooking them.
 Rice noodles work well in Asian-inspired soups and soups belonging to other cuisine types, as well.









The best way to add rice noodles to soup is to add uncooked noodles to the broth during the last few minutes of cooking. Monitor closely to make sure that the noodles are not becoming overcooked.
You could also add partially cooked noodles to the the broth, but you should add them after the soup has already been removed from the heat and immediately prior to serving. The hot broth will be enough to finish cooking the noodles even without being over direct heat.
 Use fully-cooked rice noodles in dishes that don't require any additional cooking.









Asian-inspired vegetable salads, cold bean dishes, and cold soups are good examples.

, Metallic is not a color, it is created by light reflection, so this article will use a multi-stop gradient (a gradient with more than two colors).


For gold it should contain a succession of lighter and darker shades of yellow, maybe also a bit of orange.
For bronze, yellow with a shade of green (copper oxidation is green),
For steel it should contains greys.
The chrome is also greys but more reflective (more contrast, from almost black to almost white), silver is less reflective grey and so on.

The gear does not stay on air, so add a background, and use the same golden gradient (if using this example). For the sake of simplicity, you can use a different one, maybe darker.



Note the usefulness of the drop shadow, without it it would be hard to set apart the gear from the background, now they are distinct objects.

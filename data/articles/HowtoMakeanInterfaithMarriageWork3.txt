 Make a plan for celebrating holidays from both of your religious traditions. Consider how you’ll celebrate with your families, as well as how you’ll observe holidays at home.For instance, if you are Christian and your spouse is not, ask your spouse if they are comfortable having a Christmas tree or hosting the family Easter celebration at your house.
 Most interfaith marriages get much more complicated once kids enter the picture. Talk with your spouse sooner rather than later about what religion your kids will be.This is a complicated and often touchy topic. Be sensitive about your spouse’s feelings as well as your own.
Some parents opt to raise children in both of their religious traditions. Others pick only one. Either approach can work, but both require tolerance and cooperation.
 If you have children, explain both your beliefs and your spouse’s beliefs to them. Take a positive tone towards both religions, and don’t try to convince your kids that yours is the right one.Regardless of the religion you’re raising your kids to be, it’s important for them to have a positive and respectful view of both parents’ beliefs.
 It’ll be easier to maintain marital harmony when both of your families are on board with your interfaith marriage. Explain your religion to your in-laws, and invite your spouse to do the same for your family. Make your extended family feel included by inviting them to participate in your holidays and traditions.

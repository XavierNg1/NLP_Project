 Come up with some ideas about what kind of textures you want. You can think about what you need for your house or you can get inspiration by looking online and seeing what other people have created.
 One option would be to simply use MS Paint, which comes standard with Windows and will certainly allow you to mimic that pixel texture that exists in the game. You can make simple changes to the existing textures very easily, such as by adding new colors to the textures.
 With better design software or more time and determination, you can also redesign the textures from scratch. This is the same editing process but a more distinct change or total overhaul. This takes time and skill, so don’t undertake the effort unless you’re ready!

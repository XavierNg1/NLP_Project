 If your dog is prone to chasing or biting, never leave it alone with any other animal. If you have a cat or other pet, keep your dog away from it until you’re absolutely sure it won’t attack or play rough.Take precautions when you introduce your dog to other animals. Keep it leashed and try to introduce other animals by scent first if you have the opportunity. Muzzle the dog during the meeting if you are at all concerned about an aggressive response. Reward calm behavior with lots of positive encouragement and small food treats.
 If your dog has a high prey drive, keep it leashed whenever it’s outdoors, especially if other animals or children are around. Unleash it outside only in an enclosed space with a high fence.Avoid shock collars with electronic fences, as these are less likely to prevent a dog with a high prey drive from going after a target. Your dog might run despite the electric charge, or an animal might wander into your yard.
 To understand the threat your dog poses to other animals, you have to understand what your dog was bred to do. Since some breeds were designed to chase or stalk while others were designed to kill, it’s valuable to distinguish between chase and prey drives.Groups like terriers were bred to chase and kill small animals, so they have a high prey and kill drive, even if most breeds are small or medium sized.
Sighthounds like Greyhounds are strong chasers, but don’t typically bite or kill.
Breeds like Labrador Retrievers and Weimaraners were selected for stalking, flushing, and retrieving, so their kill drive is typically low.
Some owners allow their dogs to chase down small animals, for instance in an enclosed space like a large, fenced backyard. They know their dogs will only chase and pin, instead of bite and kill. However, be aware that chase and pin behavior can also lead to the serious injury or death of a cat or other small animal.

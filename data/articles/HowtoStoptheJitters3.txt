 A bad diet loaded with sugary and fattening processed foods can often exacerbate anxiety. If you tend to feel jittery, you may want to clean up your diet. Choose whole foods like fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, lean sources of protein, nuts and seeds, whole grains, and low-fat dairy.


In addition to cutting out sugary foods, limit your intake of caffeine and alcohol which may worsen anxiety. Drink plenty of water instead., Regular exercise can also combat anxiety. What’s more, squeezing a workout into your day, particularly in the morning, can provide you with an energy boost so you don’t have to turn to caffeine. Find an exercise routine you enjoy and aim to get physical for at least 30 minutes on most days of the week., Sleep deprivation often heightens anxiety and can lead to the jittery feeling you are experiencing. Make sleep a priority to help get anxiety under control. If you have trouble getting to sleep, develop a special nighttime routine that makes getting to sleep easier.


This routine might involve taking a warm bath or shower, doing some light reading, journaling, or listening to calming music. Shut down electronic devices like cell phones and TVs that keep you awake longer., Sometimes, you may feel jittery because you are overworked and lack sufficient self-care. It’s important to set aside time each day to do things you enjoy. This helps you relax, and can even ensure you are more productive when you need to be.


Try a creative pursuit such as writing or knitting. Or, watch your favorite TV show. Do relaxation strategies such as yoga or meditation. Focus on refilling your cup so that you can effectively handle your daily responsibilities.

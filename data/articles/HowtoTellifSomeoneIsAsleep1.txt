 A sleeping person's eyelids are gently closed, not tightly scrunched together. During REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, his eyes visibly move underneath the eyelid in rapid, short movements. REM sleep typically doesn't occur until 90 minutes after the person falls asleep, and then only in 10 to 60 minute stages.So while anyone with rapidly moving eyes is almost certainly asleep, calm eyes won't necessarily tell you anything.;
, Sleeping people have a more regular, slightly slower breathing rate than an awake person. There are exceptions, such as dreaming people and sufferers of sleep apnea, who breathe in more irregular patterns.A faking person will almost always try to imitate a slow, regular pattern, but as this takes concentration, the pattern will often change within a couple minutes.
 Gently flick your index or middle finger off your thumb and onto the sleeper's upper cheek. Repeat two or three times. If you notice the sleeper's eye twitch in response, he is awake.Like many of these tests, the obnoxious sensation may cause fakers to admit the deception on their own.


Snapping fingers in front of the eye or brushing eyelashes with fingers can cause similar reactions.
 Most people have bedtime rituals, at least including turning off the light, dressing for bed, and getting into bed. Unless someone was exhausted or often takes naps, it's unlikely she's fallen asleep fully clothed in a brightly lit living room.


If you were around before that person "fell asleep," try to remember if she brushed her teeth, ate a bedtime snack, or completed whichever other rituals she normally does.

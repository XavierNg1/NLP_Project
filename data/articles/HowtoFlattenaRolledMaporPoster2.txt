 Find a spacious, out of the way area and clean it off first. Lay your item flat. Keep the curling side facedown. Typically maps and posters are rolled so they curl inwards and over the image. That’s the side that should be facedown., Any heavy object you have around your home is useful here. Books are always a good choice since they distribute weight evenly over a decent amount of space. Get as many as you can to cover the map or poster. Remember to make sure the objects are clean before you place them., It’ll take some time for the weight to be effective. Curling can take a day or more to correct. You’ll have to keep your map or poster in a safe spot as you weight. If you tried rolling the item previously, the curling may be fixed within a couple of hours., With any luck, the item won’t try to wrap itself into a tube again. You can safely hang your favorite heartthrob on your wall. Some maps and poster will need longer, so repeat treatment as much as needed.

 It's easy to enjoy each others company when you're doing something healthy. With little kids you can play fun games like finding food that's different colors or shapes. With older kids try a scavenger hunt and offer a family prize if the goal is hit.
 Who knows, you may end up creating one of those fond memories that your kids can carry and pass on to their kids. How great would that be!

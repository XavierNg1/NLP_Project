 If you gossiped about a friend and have been struggling to rebuild your friendship, approach them again with an offer to address any outstanding issues. Similarly, if you and a colleague haven’t been able to get back on good terms, reach out to them. If they are still harboring injured feelings, it may help to reiterate your regret about previous issues. However, if some time has passed, try to focus on moving forward as friends, or simply working together cooperatively. At some point when you have privacy together, say something like “I hope there’s not still any negativity between us. It feels like there might be, and I’m wondering if there’s anything I can do to regain your trust?”

, Take time to think about what you want to say before you say it. There’s nothing worse than doing something you’re feeling bad about all over again. Prevent this by recognizing when you’re speaking about someone else unnecessarily, even if you’re not saying anything negative.If possible, evaluate most of what you say before saying it, by asking yourself: Is what I’m about to say true? It is worth saying? Is it kind? You’ll likely notice yourself saying a lot less generally, and will stop gossip well before it leaves your mouth.
Especially in the context of group discussions, take a minute before chiming in to think about what you might want to add.
 A great way to get over feeling guilty about doing something negative is doing more of the opposite. In fact, try engaging in some intentionally positive “gossip.” When someone does something that impresses you or is worthy of recognition, spread the news around. Even when simple, positivity goes a long way.Say things to friends and co-workers like, “Hey, did you hear that Gary kicked a home run in every kickball game so far this season!?”
Similarly: “Becky has really been going above and beyond the last few weeks. If you’ve noticed too, make a point to thank her for effort next time you cross her path.”

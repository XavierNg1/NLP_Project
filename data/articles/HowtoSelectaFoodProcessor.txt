 Play with it in the store to see if it is easy to use. Do the pieces of it appear and feel solid, or do they look as if they might break from difficulty of moving or poor quality? The safety lock feature is complicated and expensive to fix if it breaks.;
, It is really useful to have a storage space for the cord and to have "on-board" storage for any attachments, so that they are not lost or damaged during storage.
 Ask the assistant for advice if you are not sure which ones come with the food processor that interests you but generally processor blades include:


Sabatier blade - the standard "S" shaped blade
Shredding disc - shreds vegetables and fruits
Slicing disc - slices fruits and vegetables
Julienne disc - creates long thin vegetable and fruit cuts
Dough blade - the paddles are less curved than the sabatier blade
French fry disc - creates chips for frying
Purifier or juicer blades - these vary in type and purpose

, If your food processor already comes with the lot, you don't need to worry about "added extras" but if you're in the budget end of the market, your basic model might only come with basic blades and you will need to purchase additional more fancy versions. Ask yourself how likely you are to use additional blades before purchasing them, as they can end up being an expensive waste of money.
 For your extra money, you will get a stronger and more durable motor and gears, the processor will be quieter and more stable and it will be less likely to conk out on you with frequent heavy usage. This is especially important for catering work, as well as heavy home usage. Otherwise, if you are an infrequent user of a food processor, the lower end of the range will serve you well.

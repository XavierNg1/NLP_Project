 Where is the phone going to be when it is used? People often say “I need my phone to work at the lake.”. Does it? How often are you at the lake? Is it worth paying more money every month so your phone can work at the lake once per year, in the case of an emergency?;
, The simple fact is, you are either paying for coverage or minutes (or your bill is a ton money). Which one is more important, coverage or minutes?

,, If you plan to use extras like internet or texting, be sure to purchase a plan to save money, as these can be costly a la carte.
 You’ll quickly see that having a lot of minutes and great coverage is really expensive.

 If you want to get rid of lice without using any chemicals, you can use the simple method of combing them all out with a nit comb. Nit combs aren't the same as regular styling combs; be sure to purchase the right kind at your drugstore.


If you have a comb used for getting rid of fleas on dogs and cats, that may work, too.
 Start at the scalp and work your way down the shaft of the hair to the tips, picking out lice and nits as you go. Discard the lice and nits in a bowl of soapy water. They'll die quickly once they can no longer feed.
 As more lice hatch, you'll need to keep combing them out. It's important to do so quickly, before they have the chance to lay more eggs. Keep combing out the lice and nits every 8 - 12 hours until you don't see crawling lice anymore. After that, check the hair every couple of days and comb more if necessary.


Soak the nit comb in hot water for at least 5 minutes between combings to kill the lice and nits.
When you use the nit comb method without lice medicine or other remedies, it can take a couple of weeks before all the lice and nits are totally gone. Be patient, and continue checking for lice and nits and methodically combing them out until you're sure they're dead.
 After the first combing, wash the infested person's clothing in hot water for at least 5 minutes. Wash bedding, pillows, stuffed animals, and other washable items, too. Place any items that can't get wet in a sealed plastic bag for two weeks. Soak plastic items like combs, brushes and hair supplies in hot water for at least 5 minutes.

 European fans don't call it soccer: To them it is 'football.' Recognize which is meant, but don't get stuck on wording. The important part is the sport - not the name.;
, Latin European or Latin American matches are most prominent, but remember there are different leagues out there, with totally different styles of play. Have a look at Scottish and English leagues, in which the physical side of football is more featured.
, Read up on the team you're cheering for. Know the players, the coach, the team record and why they're better than any other team.
 The MLS consists of Western and Eastern Conferences. There are 19 teams currently. Another option is watching the Primera Divisi√≥n (Mexican League), which consists of 18 teams. The best are Monterrey, Santos, Tigres, and Toluca.
, Dribble the ball around in the grass, bounce it off walls, learn to juggle with your knees. Move your feet and your heart will follow. Love of the game makes you a soccer fan.



Don't call them cleats, they are called boots. (You can also call them studs). Also, it's not called a field but a pitch.

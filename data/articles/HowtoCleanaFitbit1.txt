 The tracker on some versions, including the Blaze, can be pushed out gently from behind. Others, including the Flex 2, require you to undo the band clasp first.Consult your owner’s manual for instructions on how to remove your version’s tracker.;
, Cotton swabs and rubbing alcohol can be found at general stores and drugstores. Water should not be used, since it can get inside the tracker and damage it. Also, abrasive scrubbers should not be used., Apply the rubbing alcohol with the cotton swab. Don’t use a lot at any time. While rubbing alcohol does dry quickly, too much of it can still damage the tracker.
 Remove leftover moisture with a soft cloth. Make sure all moisture is removed before returning the tracker to the band. The “pebble” tracker in the Flex 2 can be dried completely with a paper towel. Avoid using paper towels or glass cleaners on tracker screens.

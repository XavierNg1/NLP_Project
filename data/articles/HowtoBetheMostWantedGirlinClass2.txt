 Sit where the guy can see you so he can get a good look at you, and when you walk past him, get close enough for him to smell your aroma (not too close though!).
 Talk to more than just one guy in your class. And don't forget to smile!

, Guys love it when someone else thinks they're funny. Just don't overdo it, or it will get old and you will come off as annoying.

 Look for thinner strips, since they are easier to cook, and check for freshness. The meat should be off-white or pale gray and have a blue membrane. Avoid tails that have a strong odor, discolored edges, or brownish blood at the cut ends, as these are indicators that the meat is not fresh.
, Be sure you cut it completely off, as it is inedible.
 Monk fish have a high-moisture content, and the meat will shrink or shrivel unless you draw out the water with salt first. Pat the tail meat dry to remove excess water and remaining salt before cooking.


Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius).
Brush olive oil onto the surface of the meat, and season it with salt and pepper.
Spray a baking dish with non-stick oil, and put the tails inside.
Place the dish in the oven, and bake the fish for approximately 15 minutes, or until the meat turns white. The fish is done when the meat is still firm to the touch.

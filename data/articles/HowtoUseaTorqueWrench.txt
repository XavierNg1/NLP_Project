 Purchase one directly from an auto parts store or a supplier. If you purchase a used torque wrench, take it to be recalibrated at an auto parts store.


There are four types of torque wrenches: beam, click adjustable, dial gauge and digital electronic. The main differences between these types are how they are read and how easily they can be adjusted.
If low cost and ease of use is important to you, use a beam style torque wrench.
If accuracy and repeat use is more important, use a click adjustable torque wrench.;
, This will normally be noted in the number of foot-pounds that is recommended. For example, it may indicate if 30 or 100 foot-pounds is recommended for the specific bolt or nut.


If you can’t find this specification in the instructions, look the information up online.
Note the pattern in which the instructions suggest you tighten the fasteners. For example, a star pattern or starting in the middle and alternating between the two sides.
 The torque will not work correctly on damaged threads. It may also cause problems removing the fasteners in the future.


Don’t oil the threads ahead of time. This reduces friction and increases the load on the bolt.
 Then, you can follow up with the torque wrench.
 Hold the handle so that it is centered on the pivot. For accuracy, neither end of the handle should be touching the bar.
 Don’t view it at an angle.
 Tighten the other fasteners in the recommended direction with the same technique.
, Loosen the adjustable dial. Turn the handle until it reaches the torque specification, and then tighten the adjustable dial.
 Place the tip on the fastener with the handle on the left side.
 Repeat on the same handle until you hear another click to ensure you’ve reached the recommended force.
, This will reduce the pressure on the internal spring and help to keep it calibrated.

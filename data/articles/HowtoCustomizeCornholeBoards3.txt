 For official games, the top of your goal board must be smooth and even. Both teams using the same equipment prevents one team from having an unfair advantage over another.For example, if you decorated the surface of your board with glitter, the glitter might increase the friction on its surface, making it easier to land a bean bag on the board's surface and score points.
 Official Cornhole boards are 2 by 4 feet (0.61 by 1.22 m). This can be awkward to carry, even with two people. By installing handles on either side of your board, it'll be a cinch to move around.


Measure and mark the exact midpoint on the flat face of both sides of your board with a small piece of painter's tape.
Position handles to center on the tape. Check their levelness with a level before fastening, then attach each to the sides of your goal board with screws and drill.
 Although the top surface of your board can't be monkeyed with, you can add some creative flourishes to its sides. Ribbons, rhinestones, sequins, or other eye catching embellishments may even distract your opponents from victory.


Attach fabric and similar material with tacks and small nails. Attach less flexible ornaments, like rhinestones, with glue.
 This is a great way to keep your Cornhole game going late into the evening. With a string of lights hanging on the sides of your goal board, players will be able to find them easily, though mis-thrown bean bags might prove a challenge.You can use U-shaped tacks and a hammer to fasten your lights to the sides of your board.
In many cases, like when tailgating or playing in the backyard, you may not have an electrical outlet available. For this reason, you may want a portable power supply for your lights.

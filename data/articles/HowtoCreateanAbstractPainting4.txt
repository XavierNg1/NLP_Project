 One of the easiest ways to do this is to apply artist-quality Gesso, a thick gel-like primer.Apply it like paint, or spread it around with a palette knife, if it's thick enough. This will allow you to control the style of the texture.


You could also use heavy paper or poster board. If you do this, you won't need to prepare or prime the surface.
 You should make several horizontal lines with varying spaces in between, as well as vertical lines. Mark as many as you like, but be aware that fewer lines will mean larger squares and rectangles.
 Use black paint to create bold lines. You can make some lines thicker and others thinner. Your painting will now look like a grid with black lines.
 Use primary colors (red, blue, yellow) and fill in several shapes with paint. While you could fill in every shape, this will make your painting look busy and overwhelming. Instead, choose just a few shapes to paint in. They'll stand out more.
 The white space will make your primary colored squares pop.

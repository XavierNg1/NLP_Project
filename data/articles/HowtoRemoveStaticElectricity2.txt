 Rub lotion on yourself when you get out of the shower and before getting dressed, or rub it on your hands intermittently throughout the day.


Dry skin contributes to static electricity and static shock, so lotions and moisturizers help to prevent static electricity from accumulating on your body., Switch from wearing synthetic fibers (polyester, nylon) to wearing natural fibers (cotton), which are low static materials.If your clothes are still affected by static electricity, you can rub dryer sheets on your clothes, or spritz them with a little bit of hairspray.
 Wear leather-soled shoes, which are excellent for reducing static shock, rather than rubber-soled shoes, which accumulate and create static electricity.Try experimenting with different kinds of shoes to see which shoes create the least amount of static shock. If you can, walk barefoot in the house.
Some shoes worn by those why work with electronics have conductive strands woven into the soles of their shoes which discharge static electricity as they walk.

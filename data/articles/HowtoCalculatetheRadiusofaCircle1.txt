 The formula is C=2πr{\displaystyle C=2\pi r}, where C{\displaystyle C} equals the circle’s circumference, and r{\displaystyle r} equals its radius.The symbol pi{\displaystyle pi} ("pi") is a special number, roughly equal to 3.14. You can either use that estimate (3.14) in calculations, or use the pi{\displaystyle pi} symbol on a calculator.
;
,, Whenever a math problem tells you the circumference C of a circle, you can use this equation to find the radius r. Replace C in the equation with the circumference of the circle in your problem:

For example, if the circumference is 15 centimeters, your formula will look like this: r=152π{\displaystyle r={\frac {15}{2\pi }}} centimeters.
 Enter your result in a calculator with the π{\displaystyle \pi } button and round the result. If you don't have a calculator, calculate it by hand, using 3.14 as a close estimate for π{\displaystyle \pi }.

For example, r=152π={\displaystyle r={\frac {15}{2\pi }}=} about 7.52∗3.14={\displaystyle {\frac {7.5}{2*3.14}}=} approximately 2.39 centimeters.

 It’s crucial that the area where you plan to cut is thoroughly cleaned before you begin. Even tiny dust particles can interrupt the cut and lead to uncontrolled breakage. Wipe the glass down using a quality glass cleaner or rubbing alcohol.Use a microfiber cloth – the tiny fibers can clean even microscopic dirt particles.


Avoid using cotton or nylon cloths on the glass, since these can leave behind large fibers and dust.
Use a clean, dry microfiber cloth to go over the surface once more before you begin. Make surface must be completely dry.;
, During the cutting process, tiny glass shards will be flying through the air at very high speeds. These could potentially get in your eyes or cut your skin. Safety goggles, heavy-duty work gloves and a long-sleeved shirt will protect you. Make sure they are of a high quality. Do not rub your face or eyes while you’re working with glass.


Avoid wearing open-toed shoes and sandals during this project.
Never handle freshly cut glass unless you’re wearing thick gloves. The edges will be extremely sharp., You will need to cut thick glass on a hard, flat surface that is completely free of debris. The work surface needs to be sturdy and, if possible, covered in felt or some other type of soft material. When you start cutting the glass, a great deal of tension will be created – the soft surface will allow the glass to withstand it.


If you don’t have a felted tabletop, cover the work surface with a piece of cardboard. Duct tape it firmly in place.
Keep a small broom and trash can nearby. Cutting will generate glass chips, which can interrupt the accuracy of your cut and damage your tools. You will need to stop periodically during the process to brush them away.

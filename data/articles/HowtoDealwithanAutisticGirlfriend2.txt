 Issues such as executive dysfunction, motor skill issues, social differences, sensory overload, and more can make life difficult. Your girlfriend may want comfort, or she may want to be alone.
 Autistic people may worry that their needs are burdensome or not cared about, and be afraid to speak up when there is a problem. You can help by listening to her, accommodating her needs, and asking if something is wrong if she looks upset.
 Your girlfriend might not be good at "reading between the lines" and recognizing when you're upset. It's helpful to use your words and explain to her what is wrong. For example...


"I'm feeling really stressed because of this report I have due. I'd like to be left alone to work for a while."
"When you teased me about my bald spot, I felt upset. It's kind of a sore spot for me. Please don't tease me about it."
"I know you mean well, but I'm not really looking for advice right now. I just need to vent."

, Anxiety, depression, and stomach issues may co-occur with autism. She may also have severe sensory overload at times (which can look a lot like being sick). Ask her how you can help her (helping with tasks, giving her space, just hanging out) and follow through. She'll appreciate it.
 Your girlfriend won't always understand how to act, and you can help by clarifying her intentions to others or gently nudging her onto the right track. Tackle social gatherings as a team, and help her feel wanted and included.
 Your girlfriend will have some trouble with social skills, and this won't disappear anytime soon. Let her work at her own pace, and don't push her too hard. She is doing her best.
 Autistic people are more likely to be bullied and disliked by their peers, and you may witness some ugly behavior or even receive a little for dating her. If you love her, remind yourself that it's worth it: you're here for her, not for others' opinions.

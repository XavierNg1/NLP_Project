 Start by vacuuming off the majority of the built up grime on both the cover and the fan. Then use a dishrag, preferably a micro fiber cloth, to wipe up the remaining dust using soapy water. Be as thorough as you can, you will probably not do this again for a while.

You can let the cover soak in tub of soapy water, but the fan should be wiped by hand to avoid getting water on the motor assembly or plug.
 Use a crevice or brush attachment and vacuum off the inside of the exhaust pipe. If you can reach, also use your dishrag to wipe off what the vacuum could not get., This can be done later once the entire process is finished, but at some point you should go outside and find the exterior vent for your bathroom fan. Depending on where the bathroom is located, this vent will either be on the roof or the side of your house. Bring a damp dishrag to wipe off any dirt that has built up on the other end of your exhaust pipe., If your fan had an accessible plug, be careful not to get any water inside the outlet. Doing so could result in electrocution or short circuit the fan when you plug it back in.Therefore, use a dry dishrag and vacuum to wipe off the fan housing.

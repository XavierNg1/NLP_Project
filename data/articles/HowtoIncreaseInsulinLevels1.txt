 Sometimes, diabetes cannot be controlled with lifestyle alone and you need to take medications. Medications such as glyburide (DiaBeta, Glynase), glipizide (Glucotrol), and glimepiride (Amaryl) increase how much insulin your body makes.Your doctor will prescribe one of these medications and you will work together to monitor your blood sugar.You might experience weight gain with sulfonylureas, and sometimes they cause low blood sugar.;
, The meglitinides also increase how much insulin your body makes. They work faster than sulfonylureas but don’t last as long, and they’re less likely to cause low blood sugar. If a Meglitinide is right for you, your doctor will prescribe a medication such as repaglinide (Prandin) or nateglinide (Starlix).You might gain weight with these medicines, too.

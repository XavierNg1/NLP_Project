 You don't want to try to replace the girl if there are only a few days left of that year! Do it a few weeks after the teacher starts to favour her, which is usually quite early in the year.;
, Watch her carefully for a week. No, this isn't a written invitation to follow her around and ask repeatedly: 'What are you doing now?'! Just sit quietly from your seat and watch her do her 'jobs'. Take note (in your mind if you have a good memory, or on a notepad) what she does, how she addresses the teacher, how she wears her uniform (is her skirt over her knees? Does she pull her sleeves up?) and what speed she does everything.
 After break, get your stuff really quickly so you are the first in the classroom. Put your stuff down on the table and ask your teacher if there are any jobs they would like you to do. Say something like: 'Miss ____, are there any jobs you would like me to do?'. Don't give an excuse to do a job, like saying 'I've finished my book, should I do a job for you?' will only indicate that helping the teacher is your second choice.

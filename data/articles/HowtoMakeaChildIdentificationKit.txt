 Get some paper (or index cards), and record the following data:

Gender
Hair and eye color
Height
Weight;
, Make sure that the picture is in color, detailed, and not blurred. Print a copy of the picture on some high quality paper.
 Obtain a high quality ink pad and paper, and then take the fingerprints of all your child's fingers (yes, believe it or not, all fingers have a different fingerprint).Ensure that the fingerprints are clearly visible and not smeared. After this, clearly label which finger each fingerprint belongs to.
 Using a sterilized swab, rub the inside of your child's cheek and get a saliva sample. Put the swab in a labeled envelope, and seal it when finished. Alternatively, you could pluck out (not cut) one of your child's hairs.
 Medical records will be helpful to investigators, as they contain very detailed information about your child.
 A lock box would be preferable.
 Of course, fingerprints, DNA, and basic information (like name, date of birth, gender, etc.) do not need to be updated. However, you do need to update your child's height, weight, medical records, and photo. Once a year would be good.

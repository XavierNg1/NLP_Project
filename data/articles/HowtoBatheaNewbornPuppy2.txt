 Puppies less than four weeks old do not really need to be bathed. At most, bathe your puppy one time if it is very dirty and the mother cannot clean it herself.
 Holding the puppy close to your chest will keep it warm.Newborn puppies are very sensitive to temperature.Don't put the puppy into water because its body cannot regulate temperature well.
 Choose a cloth that is clean and soft because newborn puppies are very sensitive.


For very tiny puppies, you can even use a cotton ball or piece of gauze., Wet the clean washcloth in warm water and wring out most of the excess water until it is just damp.


Do not use soap or dog shampoo on a puppy under four weeks old, its skin is too sensitive and can dry out from shampoo.
 Use the warm, damp cloth to gently wipe the puppy's coat.


Start at the head and wipe softly toward the tail.
 It is very important to dry the puppy to remove any excess moisture. A wet puppy can become too cold very quickly because it has a hard time regulating its body temperature.
 After cleaning and drying the puppy, return it to its mother so she can keep it warm.If it is not possible to place the puppy with its mother, make sure it stays in a warm area without cold drafts.

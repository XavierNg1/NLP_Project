 When wearing sequins, you should always try and contrast bold sequined statement pieces with a solid and subdued article of clothing. For example, a sequined top pairs well with simple denim jeans. If you try and pair sequins with patterns or layer multiple different colours of sequins, your outfit can become too busy and distracting on the eyes.For example, do not pair a pink sequined top with floral pants.
The sequins should be the focal point of your outfit, so stick to simple accessories when wearing sequined clothing.
 If you are creating an outfit that includes sequins, try not to go overboard. For example, if you are wearing a sequined dress, don’t pair it with a sequined clutch and sequined heels. This can be too much and you run the risk of looking like a disco ball. Too much sequins can be distracting on the eyes.You also want to avoid wearing a sequined blazer over a sequined top. Again, this is too flashy.
Similarly, stick to one or at maximum two colours of sequins in the same outfit. Too many competing colours can look busy and will take away from the dramatic effect.
 Before putting on your favourite sequined top, consider where you are heading. Although sequins are a lot of fun, you should always dress for the occasion. For example, if you are heading to the office for the day, you may want to leave your sequined miniskirt at home. However, you could pull off a blouse with sequins detailing at work.


Alternatively, if you are heading to a new years eve party, you may want to attract attention by wearing your favourite sequined dress.
 There are a host of style “experts” who will try and tell you what not to wear as you age. You don’t have to listen. Fashion choices are a great way to show off your individuality throughout your life. If you like to dress in an edgy and unique way, don’t stop just because you are aging.As long as you feel comfortable in your clothing that is all that really matters.

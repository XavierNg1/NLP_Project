 Over time your lawn borders may get a little messy. This is likely when you live in an area with chalky or sandy soil or if you've had a lot of traffic on your lawn that has damaged the edges.


When this happens, you can redefine the edges of your lawn using an edging tool. However, you shouldn't be tempted to do this too often because your beds will grow a little each time you redefine the edges.
If your edges are often messy, consider using an edging material to keep them as they are.
 Use one of the edging tools as described above to cut a fresh edge about one inch back from the old edge. If your lawn edge has been damaged a lot, you may need to make this slightly wider.


Once you've cut and made visible one full line of the bed one inch from its old location, go back to the start and cut on the bed side of the strip.
Cut at a slight angle towards the first cut you made. The idea is to sever a thin strip of turf for easy removal.
 Once you have cut the whole length, get down on your knees. If you've made a severing cut through the turf, you should be able to pull up the long strip of turf easily to define the new, neater edges.


If you are mulching your beds, rake out the mulch to fill the slightly wider area of bed you have now created.

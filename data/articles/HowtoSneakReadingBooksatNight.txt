, Having your own room helps. Don't get out your book/Kindle just yet.
 Turn on a flashlight if you need to.
 It makes breathing hard. Instead, lie flat on your belly and put whatever you're reading on your pillow.
 If it has light on it, then outside, there's a light on. Don't worry too much. If it is dark, then there is no light outside. Be careful. When there is a light outside, light coming from your room will not be seen through the cracks between your door and the ground unless someone crouches down and stares into the crack between your door and the ground. However, if there is no light outside, be careful.
 Or, just turn every light off and freeze, making no sound.
 Say something like "I was getting up and was going to get a drink of water" but change excuses if you get caught multiple times.
 Yes, it sounds ridiculous, but usually nobody will lift your head and look under your pillow. If you have a thick book, like a Harry Potter book, quietly slip it under your bed. Be careful of the thump.

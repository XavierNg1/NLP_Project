 If you want to gain any length on your hair, don't cut it. (well trim it 1/8th inch to even out the ends but that's all)

, A curling iron is one of the most damaging instruments used on African American hair types. When a curling iron is used on your hair, the barrel cover clamps down on your hair causing a weak point. With repeated use the hair shafts eventually break along these areas made weak by the curling iron. If you want longer hair, it is imperative that you stop using a curling iron to style your hair. Curling irons make hair, weak, dry and very thin. Instead try using curlers or keeping your ends evenly trimmed and simply wearing your hair down.

 You can continue to train during this time. You will need to make carbohydrates 50 to 55% of your total calorie intake. This will help deplete the muscles of glycogen stores. One gram of carbohydrate contains 4 calories; if you are on a 2,500-calorie diet, you will need to consume between 312 g and 343 g of carbohydrates in a day.
 Your body needs to rest and not burn too much energy in order to be prepared for the event. Taking a break from exercise not only allows for maximum loading, but also keeps your muscles from being overused before the event begins. This is important to carbohydrate loading and cannot be skipped!

, So, if you are on a 2,500 calorie diet you will need to consume between 437 g and 468 g of carbohydrate in a day.


Plan ahead. This will help ensure you get enough carbohydrates to fully saturate muscles. If you donâ€™t consume enough, then the loading will be wasted.
Add snacks to daily meal plan. You will need snacks to get enough carbohydrates without becoming overly full in one meal.
Eat enough calories during the day. This is pivotal. If you cut back on calories because you are not training, then you will not get enough carbohydrates for the loading to have an impact. Eat the same amount of calories as you would during training. This is especially important for women carbohydrate loading. Women may actually need to slightly increase the amount of calories they consume in a day for the loading to have an impact.

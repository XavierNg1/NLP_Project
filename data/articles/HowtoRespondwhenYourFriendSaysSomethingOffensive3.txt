 You are not responsible for making the world a perfect place, nor should you risk your safety if you're worried that the other person might turn aggressive. If you don't feel that you can handle speaking up, don't blame yourself.


If the conversation turns bad and you don't want to continue, stop. Say "I need some air" or "I don't want to talk about this anymore" and leave. Your mental health comes first.
 Take a deep breath, and remind yourself that your goal is to teach (not to attack). Keeping your cool will help you think clearly to address the hurtful remark.


You can let loose your anger in private later, by screaming into a pillow, punching the couch, playing sports, et cetera.
It's best to address the remark soon. (Don't wait for days or weeks.) If you take too long, your friend might not even remember what they said, and your bad feelings may fester and drive a divide between the two of you.
 Invite them to go somewhere with you. If at first they don't mention why, say you'd like to talk to them in private for a minute.


"I'm going to the restroom. Jessa, would you come too?"
"Adriel, let's go to the snack stand for a minute."

, By pre-emptively complimenting the person, you make it clear that you still think highly of them, and that you aren't attacking them as a person. This way, they are more likely to listen to you. If you can't think of a compliment, make one up.


For example, "I'm surprised to hear a compassionate, thoughtful person like you say something like that."
"I'm startled to hear that coming from a fair-minded person like you."

, If you criticize the person, they may feel attacked and stop listening to what you say. Make it clear that you like the person; it's their current behavior that you disagree with.
 Instead of blowing up when your friend says Muslims are naturally violent, take a deep breath and ask why they think that. Asking questions can engage their critical thinking skills and help them re-evaluate their remark. Your friend may even lead themselves to the conclusion that they were wrong. Useful questions include:


Why?
How do you know?
Why would you say/do that?
Do you agree with that?
How do you think ______ feel about that?

, Emphasize that the fact that they messed up is less important than how they respond to it. No one enjoys being told that they did something bad, so it's good to reinforce their self-esteem afterwards and remind them that this mistake does not define them.


If they directly hurt someone, offer to help them apologize and/or make up for it.

 Auditory learners retain information best when they hear it. Visual learners remember things that they see. Kinesthetic (tactile) learners often need to physically interact with things in order to understand them well. There are various other ways of breaking up the types of learning style. Think about which categories of information—and types of information—hold your attention best, and then build your learning strategy around those things., Write down each bit of information onto a separate post-it, index card, or other small sheet. Link each thing to a keyword: for instance, if you are studying anatomy, link the name of a body part to its definition and its function in the body. Then, test yourself. Read the keyword and try to recall the linked definition. Through repetition, cultivate these associations in your head until they are second nature.


You can download a flashcard app for easy access. These programs will also save you the trouble of manually writing out each piece of information.
 If you're going to memorize a lot of information at once, you'll need to keep practicing until you've hammered it into your brain. Repetition makes for lasting memories. Read over these things every day—even several times a day—until you can recall them on cue.Try memorizing things in blocks. Read over a chunk of text or a short list of terms. Keep reading it and recalling it until you know it by heart. Then, move on to the next chunk – but return to earlier chunks at intervals.
If you need to remember your locker combination, practice opening your lock over and over until you can do it without thinking. For a few days, open the lock five times in the morning and five times before you go to sleep. Make sure to supplement this method by writing the locker combination down somewhere safe!

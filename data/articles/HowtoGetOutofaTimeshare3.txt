 This practice, known as a “deedback,” transfers the property title back to the management company and releases you from future financial liability.
 Timeshare companies may be more likely to accept a deedback if there’s no outstanding balance on your account.
 Although you won’t get cash for the transaction, you’ll get the satisfaction of helping out a friend or a charity that can use it to raise funds. Be aware that because of the maintenance fees, fewer organizations are interested in accepting donated timeshares nowadays.Your timeshare usually needs to be completely paid off and current on fees if you want to donate it.
You may be able to deduct the fair market value of your timeshare as a charitable deduction on your tax return. Contact a tax professional for more information.

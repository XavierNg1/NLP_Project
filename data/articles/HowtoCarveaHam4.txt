 Turn the ham so the cut side is up to see the natural lines. Cut along the line all the way down to the bone.

Spiral sliced hams come pre-sliced, with each slice about the same in thickness. There are generally three basic cuts needed in order to remove the slices from the bone.
 Follow the line all the way up until the knife comes back out the outside edge, providing the first section of slices., The last section of the ham needs to be cut along the bone in a way that will release it, creating the last section of slices.

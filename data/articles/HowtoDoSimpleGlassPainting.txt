 Clean the glass carefully. Use white spirit or nail polish remover would do the job.;
, Glass colors are available to paint on glass. They come as water-based and solvent-based. You can use either one (try experimenting). Acrylic and oil colors can also be used but the oil paint takes a longer time to dry (glass colors are really fun to work with and gives a translucent appearance, so don't miss it). Usually Glass Liners are used to draw the outlines. Be sure to use glass liners if you are going to paint with glass colors.
 If you're confident enough, you can go ahead and draw freehand. If you've got a printed design, place the design under the glass (so that the design is visible through the glass), secure it with a tape or clip and trace it.
 Now that your design is ready, start painting with your choice of colors.
 Your artwork is all set to be framed and showcased to earn you all the credits.
